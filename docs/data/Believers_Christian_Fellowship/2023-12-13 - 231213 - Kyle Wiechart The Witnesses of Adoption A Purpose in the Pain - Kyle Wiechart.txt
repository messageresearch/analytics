comfortable building not so much in a nice soft seat but Lord just to be gathered with people that I know love you that Lord are looking to you Lord that know that they have a dependency upon you and they can do nothing without you lord that's the kind of atmosphere I like to be in and so Lord I just pray that you would come down lord tonight and dwell with us we desire to have fellowship with you Lord tonight and according to your word wherever two or three are gathered you're already there in the midst of us so Lord we know you keep your word and I just pray that you would Minister to each of

pray give us strength Lord for the journey that's before us we love you we commit this time into your hands in jesus' name amen God bless you I'll let you have your seats for just a moment I have to get used to the new Acoustics up here it's a little different so brother Emanuel brother gab you already experienced it so I got to get used to it so well God bless you it's good to see you all tonight and uh so I'm good glad you made it back home brother Gabe airplane didn't go down you made it home safely so it's it's good to see you and so had a lot of people traveling and I'm sure everybody was blessed up in Oregon brother brother Ben was up in Michigan and um I'll be honest with you tonight I I got a lot of text today and I really appreciated the text messages I I kind of needed them and because I really didn't want to preach tonight and uh just being honest and sincere um some of you knew that my uh my cousin we had a little tragedy in our family my 16-year-old cousin he's the youngest of the cousins I'm the oldest um last Monday night he went to bed said good night to the family his mom and dad perfectly healthy uh 16-year-old boy went to bed and never woke up and uh uh they did autopsy and there's absolutely nothing wrong they said he's perfectly healthy we don't know and uh so it was a complete shock to my little family my little unit my aunts and my uncles and my cousins and then um we had the showing all day on Sunday that's why I couldn't be here brother Emanuel and and uh so the showing was from 11:00 a.m. till 8:00 at night and the line kept coming through with people um they were from bluon and small little community and they were greatly loved in their little community and so it was quite a turnout of support to try to comfort the mom and the dad and I don't know in this life if I I I don't think there's too many things probably more painful than to see a son or a daughter in a casket um if there is I don't know of it and I don't want to know of it personally I don't want to ever experience something like that and um it was really tough um not because I was so close to El Elijah there was a gap between us and the age but I I mean to see someone's heartbreaking like that it does something to you you know and um I have a feeling for people and anytime I see somebody hurting it just I hurt I it breaks my heart and so it was a very difficult week and it was a difficult Sunday and the funeral was Monday and it was just difficult and I was emotionally just flatlined and I was thinking oh man I got to call somebody but everybody's ministering everybody ministered on Sunday and they're probably tired and they're worn out and so I thought well I'll just go and I'll just share whatever's on my heart and then um and you know how when you go through certain things in life it kind of changes your perspective on things sometimes we get a little out of balance I think that's safe to say um we can get get a little bit too focused uh view we get a little bit too narrowed view of our life and our surrounding and those who have contact with and those who we have an influence with and my great takeaway from even this last weekend is um I I'm I'm definitely going to make sure that I have an involvement in my extended family and that extended family is the family that God chose for me to be a part of and I love my church family but there's a reason why I'm a part of that extended family yeah and I was thinking about Jesus you know when he came he came into his own and his own received him not I didn't stop him just CU he was rejected just because he was despised just because he was challenged in the things that he was saying it didn't stop him interceding on their behalf and I think we should never stop ever in our pursuit to be a light to our families I think the scripture said the sick need a physician not the whole and um my wife and I both kind of settled within ourselves that if our light's going to shine it's going to shine brightest in the darkest of spots and so I'm going to continually make an effort to be an influence forever I can be and I um I had shared it was interesting You Youth know I had shared a the last youth meeting uh I'm on part six of adoption and uh I my title was the purpose of pain and I had told my wife after the service that night I says something's wrong I says that wasn't for them that wasn't for them something wasn't right and I you know I any Minister you want to minister in such a way that the people get something they're helped that's the only objective in Ministry is to minister to people and at that night I was sitting there and I was bothered I'm like man maybe maybe they're too young maybe they haven't experienced enough pain yet to understand maybe what I was saying and and then I just you know I just been thinking about that for days and days and then then this situation happens this tragedy hits our home or our family and like wow the purpose of pain and uh we were there on the funeral on Monday and everybody is heartbroken like no nobody can speak Carrie was there with me and everybody was just sitting down there and child's and son is just just the family Aunts Uncles and cousin that's it nobody else there and it was just silence everybody's just weeping tears and just heartbroken you know and then my aunt says if anybody would want to say something you're more than happy to say something now and obviously I'm sitting there and I'm like oh man ah the purpose of pain and I didn't say nothing I I I was like I'm not going to say anything I'm just going to sit here and one my uncle would speak and then my cousin would say something and another cousin say a couple things and and it was still just so sad and I was sitting there just breaking in my heart just just heartbroken you know just seeing everybody in such a heartbroken condition it it breaks you down and then finally I just said I hope purp is okay but I just would like to share with you a thought that I shared with our youth on the purpose of pain and I says I don't believe in times of great pain there's a choice I says pain can either point you to the Lord and draw you closer to him or it can drive you farther away um but I don't believe that's ever the purpose to drive you away I believe it's always there intending to pull you closer into his presence and I said I know two things things about pain every human I know tries to avoid it and every human I know will never be able to we will all at some point in this life if the Lord terries and we live long enough we will come in contact with times of great great pain almost at times it feels like unbearable pain and it's never there I believe that God always has a purpose in it and there's things that come into view when you're in times of great pain and I told him I said my scripture that I was inspired by was Hebrews 12 looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was just before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God and I said he knew the joy that was right before him but this was one time in history where this one didn't bypass the pain this was one time in history where he embraced the pain cuz he knew that he was embracing that cross not for himself but for others and I says at this time I think this is a great opportunity for us to just look to him CU he's the only one that can really bring you comfort I can't comfort you the uncles the cousins nobody knows what to say nobody can bring a comfort at a time like that only Christ can bring Comfort at those times he's the only one that can do it and so it's then I began to realize I says you know what God gave me that inspiration he let me study it out for the Youth but that was for them that was for my family and then that began to think my I thought inspiration would come so I could minister to you I had inspiration came so I could minister to my extended family and it just hit me I'm like wow I need to broaden my perspective a little bit and I believe we're Witnesses we're lights in this world and I think that like um I was thinking you know the sun and the word of God came and it was a light and it drove back the darkness and you're thinking that Son of God the fullness of the godhead bodily when he came manifest on the earth there was a little orbit of people that were around his life at that time that he was having an influence on and we not the fullness of the godhead L but if you have an ounce of God one little inkling of God you're the light to somebody in this world that you're coming in contact with there's little Earths and there's Little Moons going around your sunlight and you're having an effect on them and I I believe it's all part of a purpose and God had a purpose in the family I have he has a purpose in the family you have he has a purpose in the place he's got you living in the place that he's got you working he's got a role for you to play and I think it's good to be mindful of that at all times and so I hope it's okay and then as I began to meditate on it I I had a certain direction that I thought I would Minister and then um I had went ministered a month ago to the youth on another picture that I saw in adoption and adoption for me has been interesting it's like a putting a jigsaw puzzle together it's like I can't see the next piece until the picture develops just a little bit more you ever do that you look into doing a jug jigsaw puzzle and you see one piece you're like where's that thing go and then just in a couple moments you'll put two other pieces together and you're like that's where that goes didn't realize it and that's what I've noticed here in adoption there's certain things that I I couldn't place until the picture developed for me just a little bit more and so I hope it's okay tonight I'd like to take these last two thoughts that I ministered to the youth because now I see how they actually connect together and I'd like to minister that to you if that's okay I can't minister to you but the word god Christ can minister to you and my whole heart's desire I've been praying I said Lord just give me something to strengthen the people just a little food that's all we need just a little food and so if you don't mind will we all stand with me tonight and we will uh oh brother gab will be so proud of me I did a PowerPoint brother I did a I knew he'd be proud of me I'm nervous as a wreck brother you know how difficult it is for me to stay on task with running this one and then this one and this one but I had a lot of quotes after I've been meditating on it last night and today and I thought Wednesday night or it's already getting dark at 5:00 it's very cold it's really warm in here I know how the eyes get a little tired I've been there done that so I thought maybe hearing my voice and seeing some quotes and seeing a PowerPoint might help a little bit tonight and trust that it will be so if you will please turn in your Bibles to Hebrews 12 for the Franco you can I have the PowerPoint you're more than welcome to look at that yeah all right say Amen if you're there or if you're looking up above scripture says wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such cont contradiction or opposition of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds you have not resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and he scourgeth every son whom he receive amen you may be seated so for a title tonight I'd like to take the witnesses of adoption and as a subtitle the purpose in the pain and I wanted to put this picture up because this is the picture of Mount Transfiguration where in brother bham said this was Jesus's adoption this is when a cloud came down Moses and Elijah was there beside him representing the law and the prophets the raptured and the resurrected and there was also three other witnesses there these were the Earthly Witnesses Peter James and John whom Christ took up there with him to witness this adoption where a cloud descended and a voice came out of the cloud this is my beloved Son hear ye him and also in this day and in this age we've also had a cloud come down and in this age brother brandham went up there and he said there was three of us there was me Fred sofman and Jee Norman because there had to be in the mouth of two or three Witnesses because God was getting ready to do something great and we look at these Witnesses and the thing that I want to bring into view is this is Jesus's adoption and in this adoption we have Peter James and John and we know that Peter James and John represent what faith hope and charity the witnesses of a mature Son of God not so much how well you can quote the Bible not how well you know the message but there's three things that'll be standing screaming a witness of your maturity in Christ and its Faith its hope and its charity those three are the Earthly Witnesses of an adopted son and i' like to take some time to look at that Through The Eyes of pain because every time you see these Witnesses come into view it's during a very difficult moment faith is usually expressed when you have need of it when you're sick hope you have to look beyond the circumstances and the reasoning of your own mind because everything around you looks hopeless but your hopes are in Christ and in the promises of his word that he'll fail not he always keeps keeps his promises and we all know that charity must be present for an adopted mature son without charity you're nothing you're a tinkling symbol and a sounding brass though you have knowledge of all the Mysteries and you have all Faith to move the mountains without a genuine charity that loves even your enemies you're nothing these are the witnesses of an adopted son and these must be present so I hope it's okay I wanted to look at the last portion because I've realized something with adoption as I've been meditating on it now for months adoption is painful when a baby is born we come up through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit you have water blood and spirit you have the ingredients for a birth do you ever spank a baby no do you ever correct a baby no it can do no wrong it can do whatever it wants however it wants as loud as it wants when it doesn't matter the baby's never corrected because it's under complete dependency of a mother and father to do everything for it it can do no wrong because it has someone doing everything for it but we know that there must come a chastening of a son as a son matures right and so as the son is maturing he's got to get ready for some chastisement that's part of the maturing process and what God deems is the right kind of Correction and pain needed that's on him we don't all have the same race set before us you have a certain course I have a certain course and I must run with patience the race that's before me but each of us are going to experience great pain amen as we come to great maturity yes there's just no other way faith can only be expressed through difficult situations charity can only be expressed when someone actually hates you you know these Witnesses can't stand and witness on your behalf unless there's a reason to do so and so in just backing up for a moment the Bible says in Galatians 4:4 but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ right now have we come to the fullness of time yes we have come to the fullness of time Revelations 10:1 and time was no more he put one foot upon the sea and one foot upon the the Earth right you had the image of the Beast and the and the the Beast himself and he put both feet upon both images and he stood there and he swore there's time no more the fullness of time has come and so in this fullness of time we know that there must come a complete maturity of the Bride because everything must wrap up and I believe that this age is an adoption age just as you had justification you had sanctification you have the baptism the Holy Spirit the fourth stage is an adopted mature son maturity is what we're talking about and just like a wheat that matures brother bam says modern events made clear by prophecy we're at the end of denomination the wheat's taken shape but what's the matter with the wheat now you can't you can't lay in the presence of the sun to ripen before the combine picks it up so we know that there must come a great time of heat a great time of uh discomfort for the little wheat to get completely ripened up so that it can be harvested and another interesting thing about how they used to harvest back in the days used to use a threshing floor you know what a threshing floor is they beat the tar out of it they beat it and beat it and beat it and it's all part of the process you can't actually get the wheat in proper condition until it goes through the threshing floor so in continuing on here brother bham says hear ye him here God was going to do something great because he was bringing forth Peter James and John now I'd like I'd call it hope faith and charity and these three great gifts of God say take Peter for Faith James for Hope and John always love which is charity and he takes faith hope and charity with him and he goes up into a mountain because because he's fixing to do something he's going to make an expression he wants it to be confirmed and he always confirms it with three Witnesses two or three witnesses that was an Old Testament statement that out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established and he goes up to the mountain calling these three men three outstanding gifts of the people that was with him and brings them up to the mountain and then he has three Heavenly beings something must going to take take place he's got three Earthly Witnesses and three Heavenly Witnesses there's Moses Elijah and Jesus transfigured or transformed and there was Peter James and John the Earthly and the Heavenly all meeting together now amen and that's exactly what's been taking place in this day and it's exactly what's going to be present as Witnesses now um if you've ever bought a car or bought a house uh there's a witness you ever noticed that there's never a transfer of ownership from one hand to another unless there's Witnesses present right you get a notary public and he's he's identified by the the local governments as a true witness one that can be trusted to oversee this transfer of ownership from the hands of one to the hands of another and so if there's going to be Witnesses on the scene there must be going to be a great transfer here of responsibility and ownership from one's hand to another's hand and if I would like to recall to your mind take the book eat the book out of the hand of him that sth so there's going to be a great transfer of responsibility here as brother brandham said in Jesus's Mount Transfiguration when he said this was his adopted moment he said now father could sit down and rest his son would complete the work and so now we know that God is wanting to take a rest he's waiting for your witnesses to arrive on the scene to witness the transfer of ownership and to enforce redemption's rights and those Witnesses very simple faith hope and charity not how well you understand the Seven Seals a living epistle being read of all men a life lived a life expressed taking the book and eating the book and thundering out the mystery of Christ in your own life life that's the Thunder I think prophet of God said the voice of what a thousand lived lives red and so these Witnesses must be on the scene there's also another time that you bring Witnesses on a scene it's in a court case have judge if you're on a prosecution or defense both sides produce Witnesses both against and or for and we know when Jesus was condemned to death they brought forth false Witnesses because he death could not be pronounced unless there was Witnesses but we also know that in 1963 when that cloud came down it was the white wigged one the judge for the judge is here to enforce redemption's rights and if redemption's rights is changing hands from him that sth upon the throne to him that was told to take the book and eat the book and prophesy again there must be three Witnesses witnessing and enforcing life amen testim testifying that life is here as there was false witnesses to condemn him there is true Witnesses here to testify that life has come to you and to me and those Witnesses are faith hope and charity so I'll read this the Life Magazine packed the article of it the mystical circle of light goes up into the air above Tucson and Phoenix in the same way that I told you nearly a year before it happened now it would be and like a triangle the picture hangs in the church down there you that took that magazine has it there it was just exactly they said it's 27 M high and 30 Mi across they don't understand yet what happened it appeared mysteriously and went away mysteriously Fred sofman brother Jean Norman and I standing there three is a witness look he took them up on top of a mountain Peter James and John to give witness they stood there and watched it when it happened they seen it done I know that I am not fully grasping this picture but I know there's something here I know something's developing for me I know there's something taking place and I know I'm not doing justice but yet I can feel it and yet I I can't seem to grab it for you and so I guess we just wait for the jigsaw puzzle to continue to develop it says when that which is in 1 Corinthians says when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child and I understood as a child and I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as I am known and now abideth faith hope and charity these three the greatest of these is Charity so we can see that as we are becoming mature we're moving from being a child to being an adult to being one that has the responsibility to bear his name and we have this transfer of ownership and we have a job to do we see these three Witnesses continuing to come into view and so the Bible or I'm sorry a Greek word for Te witness is to testify or to be a testimony before a judge and I think that's exactly what's happening and so I'd like to take a look at the first Earthly witness hope this is so simple and yet so profound to me um we know that for a a mature son he's got to have his hope in the right things just simply has to have his hope in the right things you're not in maturity if your hope only lies in what you can understand around you or happening to you your hope must go Way Beyond what you mentally can understand our hopes are built on nothing less than Jesus words of righteousness so this must be a constant testifying witness in your life testifying no matter what situation you find yourself in no matter what difficulty that you can't seem to figure your way out of it does not matter because your hopes lie in his promise it does not matter all things work together for the good to them that love God everything's going to work out for the good in the end I know it is see There's Hope Hope's a wonderful thing it's a good thing and we got to have hope I mean when you come in contact with the world they're hopeless I mean what kind of witness are you if you're hopeless miserable and sad and despondent and upset I'm sorry your witness isn't testifying very well of your maturity because the dark and dying world all around you they're looking for something real they don't want to or corrected that they're wrong they want life they need life they need something they can get a hold of that won't conform them into an image but it'll transform them from the inside out I still believe the gospel of Jesus Christ has the transforming power to make a sinner a saint we either believe that or we don't why are we coming here why do we believe this message if there's no power in it why do we do the things that we do if we're Believers we believe that what we are hand holding in our hands is the literal life of Jesus Christ available to somebody if we don't don't talk about it and don't claim to be a Christian is if a Christian has confidence that God keeps his word he has a hope that what God did for you you he'll do for somebody else he's got to have that hope it's a living witness that the world needs to see hope I find find it also interesting that brother brandham in this Natural Life lost his natural hope but he never lost his spiritual hope never lost his spiritual hope you'll get we'll see that here in a second now I wanted to pull this old Webster's Dictionary this is from n or 18 something 1850 his definition of Hope a desire of some good accompanied with the least the slight expectation of obtaining it or the belief that it is obtainable hope differs from a wish or a desire in that it implies some expectation of obtaining the good desired or the possibility of possessing it hope therefore always gives pleasure or Joy so in the midst of Sorrow when all seems hopeless no not us we have joy real hope says no that's mine that's obtainable that's for me that's for me me he's here for me greater is he that's in me than he that is in this world brother Brenham says this and your little boy at the point of death Billy Paul 18 months old and your little girl at 8 months old is lying here dying with menitis and you just prayed and God pulled a sheet down and said shut up don't hear won't hear you at all turned his back on you he's a good god huh he loves you and every girl you ever went with every boy you ever associated with your very best of friends has walked away from you and you're a religious fanatic everything he was telling me was the truth everything that he would say just fall right in line see here I just I was just then about to say then I if that's the way he has to act then I won't serve him just just as I said that there was something come from somewhere else way down on the inside said who are you to begin with the lord gave and the Lord takes away see that's that's that Inside Man and it don't reason at all no human capability to understanding this there's something way down deeper past mental faculties that can cry out and say though he slay me yet I'll serve him no matter what situation look at the difficulty he lost his wife he lost his child all his friends have forsaken him he's a religious fanatic he's a good god huh yeah he took everything from me and though he slayed me I'll still serve him what mental faculties could he lean upon at that moment nothing but something came down from the inside I looked back and I thought how did I get on Earth I come from a bunch of drunkards how' I get here who gave me life who gave me that wife who gave me that baby where did my wife come from where did my life come from I said though he slay me yet I will trust him I said get away from me Satan I laid my hand over on my baby I said Sharon honey I'll lay you now in your mother's arms in a few minutes the angels of God will come and take you away but one one day daddy will see you again his hopes are not based upon the situation even brother bam said like a black sheep God wouldn't even hear me but his Hope was even going beyond that though God had even turned his back on he saiding I'm My Hope Is Still honey I'm going to see you again his hope never spiled a witness was still testifying and though he slay me yet I'll serve him brings into view job now none of us have ever been in this kind of a position brother Benham said and I believe him I mean he's going on pretty good got a good reputation in the community he's well sought out everybody wants to hear from him and in a moment's notice his whole career his business everything he owns wiped out all his children the ones that he loves so much that he interceded for constantly or constantly on his mind he was interceding for them dead then his health goes and he's on a ash Heap scraping the boils from intense pain and then it's not over his closest of friends now come against him start to falsely accuse him saying you you you you done wrong you've done something wrong somewhere we don't believe you here he is being falsely accused by his own friends he did nothing wrong and then his wife comes the closest thing he has on this Earth his own wife he says Curse God and die he said says I won't do it I won't do it right and he wouldn't do it though these skin words eat up this body yet in this flesh I shall see God hope never failed but look at the amount of pressure look at the pain look at the difficulties that was coming upon this son to get him to lose hope yeah yes that's why I said there's a purpose in the pain and I also believe that for an adopted son it's painful there's just no other way these W Witnesses must testify on our behalf job testifies in 81315 he says where are the paths of all that forgot God and the Hypocrites hope sh and the Hypocrites hope Shall Perish whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be a spider's web he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure there is nothing in this natural world that we can put our hope in there's just nothing it's crumbling it's a spider's web go lean up against a spider's web see if it'll hold you anything in this natural world is compared to you putting your Hope on a spider's web so we don't ever lose our trust in God we put our trust in the Lord that's the only place I can place my hopes we must amen blessed is the man that trusteth the Lord in whose hope in whose hope the Lord is Romans says and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why do he yet hope for but if we hope for that which we see not then do we with patience wait for iten so we see now again adoption coming into view and we seeing Our Hope coming into view again can I call a second witness the second Earthly Witness is Faith we're very familiar with this The Heroes of Faith I like to go through it who through faith subdued kingdoms and I want you to see where does this faith when does this Faith witness when does this Faith testify what conditions do you see who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness and obtained Merc uh promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness remained strong waxed Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection others had a trial of coel mockings cruel mockings and scorings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sought asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins and death ol and Afflicted and tormented oh whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and all these have obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that what that they without us shall not be made perfect if you're expecting the Christian life to be without problems sorry it's not you will never remove the cross from Christianity you're never getting away from it take up your cross daily and follow me it is a difficult path it just is you can't expect this isn't a Joel ostein gospel guys it's not God is Not Just existing to be your Aaron boy and make life easy for you at all times I believe in fact he actually matures you to the point where you look at pain and difficulty right in its face and say that's the path that God needs me to take that's the path I take I've said it before if you can't find the cross that you're supposed to be picking up every day you are probably on the wrong path and you need to re-evaluate the life that you're now living if there's a cross daily that I must pick up and I can't find it something's wrong somewhere everybody yeah something's wrong somewhere I'll tell you what's difficult you know what's difficult getting around people that disagree with you vehemently I told you humans avoid pain at all costs they don't even like to associate with people that don't agree with them oh what great hope you're going to be how are you going to affect them what hope does the world have if you don't like to even in Cur a little bit of pain and discomfort of someone disagreeing with you maybe you need to be challenged a little bit maybe you need to someone to push against your experience a little bit maybe you need that I I I literally at times I mean at times I wonder I I was sharing this with a brother I says now think about this psalms 27 says I'm standing on a solid rock and if I'm on a rock a solid rock that can't be moved and I know that everybody else is on sinking sand if they come against me and they push against me if I am on a rock and Jesus Christ is a personal revelation to me as an individual and not just a lifestyle choice I choose to live by then when the pressure and difficulty comes my way I'm not moving you're not moving and if you're so afraid to come in contact with someone that doesn't exactly agree with everything that you stand for because you afraid something's wrong why are you afraid why are you nervous God that's why I don't believe in cutting yourself off from an extended family that doesn't agree with you I don't believe that for nothing I just don't I think salt must make contact for it to have an effects it just has to it's got to and if you're so unsure of your experience get alone with God I don't know what to tell you get alone with God search out your own experience wrestle it out with fear and trembling before God and get real with God and stop playing Church what's the point why why waste the time why come for me this is a reality and if this isn't a reality then we are all wasting our time we either have the goods or we don't have the goods we either have the Life of Christ or we don't have the Life of Christ we either have a solid rock Foundation we're standing on we don't have a Solid Rock Foundation we either have truth or we don't have truth we either have an experience with God or we don't have an experience with God these things got to be wrestled out and questions got to be asked if you can't come in contact with someone that even slightly disagrees with you without losing your mind you become so isolated and you become of no effect to nobody I'm never mad by the way I just get passion I just I'm not just passion continuing on faith have faith in God now it's it's not something that you just kindly push yourself oh okay not something you kindly push yourself to I've noticed so much that in my meetings that people try to work themselves up into something to make them believe now you can't do that you're just beating the air but faith is something that's just as calm and settled as can be it's taking God at his word and having the Assurance in your heart that God is able to keep what he has said that he would do and will perform everything that he said that he would do now I've noticed that and so many times people think that they must be prayed for and that's all right that we should pray for one another or that some hands may be or some evangelist hands or some but must be ministered that's all right that'll bring contacts and so forth of Faith but real unadulterated faith is taking God at his word real mature unadulterated faith God said it I believe it that's it that's it so it's a witness now I know some people said brother bam makes that quote th the enemy of faith is Hope remember hearing that enemy of faith is Hope let's look at this I like this he says and hope what a beautiful thing hope is oh little timid hope lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the greatest enemy faith has that's right the greatest enemy Faith's got is hope now hang with me you'll see what this means soon cause a person becomes so hopeful till they leave away from Faith they so are hoping that God does it but there's nothing inside of them that says God's going to do it hope looks out at something faith is standing in the thing that he's looking at he's inside of it believing and standing on it now now um yeah now hope will agree with the Bible hope will say it's true hope will say I believe every bit of it I believe that that's the word of God and I believe that God will keep his promises that's good you should say that you should believe that hope believes all of it but hope then says now I believe that God will heal but just look at my condition now Faith don't look at that faith comes around I don't care nothing about the conditions God said so and it's mine you see faith is Burly as I once said faith has hair on its chest when it stands up and pulls big muscles out everything else vanishes away it just takes its flight When Faith really takes a hold nothing else stands faith is a true witness and it's tough and rugged but it looks like hope got thrown out don't it don't worry let's see what brother bam says about this it says I'm telling you Faith but you've got to have hope and charity if you've got real Burly faith and no love with it you've ruined your influence before the people if you haven't got love mixed with it yep see you seen people real Burly what we would say excuse the expression Bulldog Faith to grab a hold but it's so rough with it then you see when you do that it it does it hasn't got the kindness here to move with it so what we need is hope faith and charity isn't that right hope faith and charity together God help our church to have it like that the people to have that combination a so don't throw out hope everybody Hope's not the enemy you need faith hope and charity it keeps it all in balance you have a bulldog rugged faith and mean as a rattlesnake with it with people you better believe the word of God you're going to perish if you don't well that was spoken in Real Love wasn't it you know sometimes you just got to sit down and have a relationship with somebody before you can tell them the truth how many have hold the old heard the old saying people do not care what you say until they first know you care and he say well I I told him straight he didn't receive it serpy you said it mean is a right snake you said it to prove a point why don't you say it the next time with a Little Love in Your Heart and a desire to help the man I think we should live our lives always as able Minister what's an able Minister a minister that's there to minister and help somebody that's the objective is help somebody not to just go around with a blow horn and just tell everybody what we know and say everybody rejected it no they probably just rejected you they probably just rejected your approach no love no sincerity no joy the one that's never happy and angry at everybody and criticizes everybody he's going to tell me how to live my life I'm sorry the Witnesses are witnessing against you faith hope and charity isn't speaking on your behalf they're not backing you up continue on the Rapture but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture now it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have Revelation without it being Faith see faith is a revelation because it's something that's been revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to that which had been revealed to him as though it was wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is is a revelation of God and the church is built upon a revelation and the whole entire body that's why he could say to Peter Peter who do you say that I am not to the group you as an individual who do you say that I am and he could say by Revelation Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God not to the group it's always to the individual and what Echoes outside of your what Echoes from your life when ask the question not what your church says not what your church believes not what your pastor says what do you say what's echoing from your life can I call my third and Final witness without this it's all in vain go back through this I want you to see brother Bam's mindset in this he said here not long ago I had a trial you're precious they're they're precious to you I buried a little baby in the afternoon out of the home there there was a little baby was born and it died right away the mother and father I said Oh see it's a little cut it's something to bring you closer to God I remember when my little girl had died and I laid her and my and her mother 's arms and buried them out there in the graveyard my father died my brother got killed instantly all of that happened at once and there I was going up the road one day a pair of boots on right after the flood walking tears running down my cheeks I could hardly I I couldn't stand it hardly walking up the road Mr Eiser of Jeffersonville there he's he's something another in the state law there Senate I believe anyhow he was going up the highway and I seen him and he stopped his car he come to the church once in a while little church he put his arms around me he said Billy I want to ask you a question I said all right brother eer what is it he said your father died in your arms your brother died before you could get to him you was holding the hand of your wife when she you kissed her goodbye and you told her you'd meet her at the gate said you turned right around walked down there and God took your baby right from your arms and you was standing there praying for it said what does he mean to you today I said he's more than life to me I said said do you still love him I said brother iser I could deny myself before I could him why I said Down Yonder in a little old Coal Shed one night I was a sinner boy and I was kneeling on a grass stack praying there's something that happened there a new creature was born William brandham died in Jesus Christ come in and since then I love him Mr iser if the whole world should turn me down and everything else I still love him if he condemns me I still love him there's maturity There's real charity though everything comes against me I still love him no matter what even at the end of the road he condemns me I still will love him there if there is such a thing as love in hell he said I'll still love him there a witness was speaking from that time a man that could take the challenge of a priest and let a drunken Soldier spit in his face today today we got the wrong conception of power power is overcoming and returning good for evil that's real power that can love your enemy and do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's God's power yes Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to return good for evil from his heart not of religious duty but from his heart see that's the true witness not I'm going to be nice to this person cuz I know I'll be able to tell people that hey they were they treated me like this and you know what I just was sweet to them and I was kind and then you went told everybody about how you were just so sweet and kind to this person though they did you so evily that's religious that's just religion sorry that's not from the heart you didn't do that for him you did that to exalt yourself yes you vaunteth yourself and exalted yourself do good and then don't tell anybody about it someone does you evil you do really good for him and don't say a word to nobody about it don't breathe it then God gets the glory not you perfect Faith 1963 and when we were yet sinners alienated and without God in the world in that muck of the mud as I talked about this morning God come to us and God sought you you never sought God I might say that again you never sought God so now how much compassion and sympathy are you going to have with the lost and dying world all around you you cuz you never sought him he sought you out so I'm wondering if we are now continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ if we will seek others out who've rejected us despise us think we're crazy I think we do I think we have enough love in our hearts and compassion for another person that we would want to go do something to help them no matter what no matter if they reject you it doesn't matter then you never sought him out no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God came down in that muck that you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are what did that somebody that loved you can't you have faith in what he promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word couple weeks ago I was listening to the message of Grace and I heard something for the first time brother bham said that thief on the cross that was right besid him he this what he said he said God never once crossed that boy's mind his whole life not one time in his life did he even consider God he's on the cross dying he says Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom he said today you'll be with me brother bham said Grace Grace nothing but Amazing Grace not him that willth or him that runneth it's not because you've done good or because you've done bad it's Grace you didn't deserve it we never have you never will it's all Grace that caps down coming down screaming Grace Grace double Grace you don't deserve it it's not about what you've done I've done it I've completed this work I'm the author and I'm the finisher of your faith what I started I finished not you something he's finishing the work and it's all Grace we know this one charity suffers long and it's kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not its own is not easily provoked and it thinketh no evil it rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth it beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and endureth all things charity never fails remember the story of the man who came home late or he was at the bar and he told all his friends we're sitting there and the friends say there is no such saying as a real Christian anymore a bunch of Hypocrites they're all like us they just go to church on Sunday and Wednesday and they just act like us every day living he goes no boys there's one Christian I know of one he goes no no such thing he said yes sir it's my wife no come on home I'll show you remember they went on home and he says hey boys let's act real drunk when we get there walk in the door they're acting drunk drunk said make us some ham and eggs we want ham and eggs he goes okay honey I'll go get you it being rough and Gruff and everything he goes okay watch watch watch and brings out the ham and eggs grabs the ham and eggs throws it across the room angry ah you know I don't like my eggs like that she goes I'm sorry honey your husband do that to you wives what are you going to do he's I'm going to put him in his place I promise you you'll never win him that way you can do it if you want to You'll Never Win him she says all right honey I'm sorry I'll go make those eggs the way you like them again goes back in the kitchen they go in there listen to her probably thinking she's probably cussing him under his breath something fierce nope she's singing a little song must I bear this cross alone there's a cross for him there's a cross for me that's what she's saying man they all say there it is there's a real one this one don't just talk about Christianity here's a real one we gave her every right we gave her every reason why she should get angry at us and blow her top she must have the goods there was a real witness there testifying and it was charity testifying this one's a real one this one actually has the life of Christ and she led her husband and all her friends to the Lord so kind of wrap it up here I can't see the clock um we all know brother Bram talks about that eagle and its eaglets and one thing about the eaglets as they begin to grow Mama Eagle makes the nest really nice for those little eaglets when they're babies but as they become mature and they get to growing up and it's time for them to get the flight time for them to realize what they're made of is just exactly what Mama's made of Mama ego gets real mean really starts I mean mean mean mama starts pulling out all the rabbit hair all the feathers all the soft grass everything nice and comfortable and starts to introduce all these painful Pokey proddy things into the life of this Eagle such a mean mother no it's time to go yes time to grow up no more babying time to mature and that Mama gets really mean you know what it'll do stops bringing food back to the nest that'll get them moving yeah Mama stops coming and feeding those babies and then they have to leave the nest or they'll die comes a point in time you have to leave the nest or you die you must move on into maturity you must not stop taking a path of least resistance you must stop avoiding a cross every day that you need to pick up yes it comes a point in time you got to grow up realize you were built for this you find yourself in a bad situation a spouse a family member a son a daughter man they're difficult oh I just can't I can't live a Christian Life with them n yeah you can just need to revisit the cross yes just need to go back there and consider remember he bore a cross not for himself but for somebody else Jesus bore a cross for somebody else me and you for the joy that was set before him fellowship with me and you he was willing to endure a cross so then we have to find ours cuz someone else is dependent upon us and so I'll just how many remember six seconds Smith Brother bam talks about 6 second Smith he was a boxer right it's interesting there's one last component that this boxer needs to know see if you can find out see what see what he says he says I tell you Billy no matter how well trained you are and how ath how much athletic experience you have and how strong you are for your size or anything like that said a lick stops the blood when it hits you like that okay well trained athletic and strong but he's got to be beat up a little bit he can't take a punch he can't take the pain and difficulty of someone beating him so what was the last training of brother brandham 6C Smith beats the tar out of him let's see if I say he said but he says uh said your body builds up to that so it can come back quit if if you get hit and just fall over and you lay there and take a count but if your body is built and can stand the licks said then when you when you hit it a hard H lick hits you said then you'll come right back quick back to your feet get knocked out of the ring jump back in he had just got through knocked me Plum out of the ring he said you have we just got to do this do that see he liked to kill me he was about 30 40 lbs heavier than I ever was and he was a fighter and I was just a student so he was almost killing me he said but you'll appreciate that when you get in the ring and I found that to be true a mean mama Eagle to the babies making life difficult no just bringing it to maturity 6C SM Smith training a boxer hated his student no last part of the challenge I got to beat you up I have to just beat you I have to bring one trial after another trial after another trial after one left hook after another right hook I'm going to punch you in the gut ever feel life is like that at times it's training you come back quickly get back in the ring work to be done and you got to take the licks and we all got them coming so oh we're going to wrap it up here but just so you know that God has a purpose in the licks there's a purpose behind it every pain serves its purpose you see they could not figure out what God's God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was an elective love and the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proved truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God hath chosen you to Salvation through sanctification and the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to sufferings as he did job that is his prerogative and he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose so pain has a purpose if he did not have a purpose he wouldd be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while he would that we would be made perfect be established be strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us and he he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 58-9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered and being made perfect he became became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey in him in plain language the very character of Jesus Christ was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection no perfection without the pain everyone no perfection without pain none none none none so count it all joy when you fall into divers Temptations for the trying of your faith it's serving its purpose the trials must come the difficulties of life it's not there to kill you it's just there to mold in you the very character of Jesus Christ that can only come through pain just part of the process this is a continuation he says why does he stand stand by the reason is in this Romans 8:17 and 18 and if children then hirs and Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory and not a gift a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation amen it's worth the pain it's worth the pain it's worth it if you only knew what lied just ahead but you have to look at what's just ahead to endure the sufferings who for the joy that was just before him he had to look just a little bit farther ahead to endure that cross and so do we we're going to rule and reign with him but we're not coming to it easy everyone adoption is a tough one maturing of a son is painful be ready I don't know what else to say but just be ready and thank God that those witnesses will stand on my behalf in the midst of the situation cuz he began this work he finishes this work this isn't relying upon you as an individual to figure something out or be able to do it in your own willpower no just just believe God have faith and confidence that God will keep his word and the one that started the work in you will finish the work in you if you stand like that then he comes on the scene and fights the battles and he on the scene comes down something bubbling up on the inside I don't know where it came from it's past reasoning it's past understanding but my hope lith in the Lord he is my hope and my stay he is my strength when I am weak something bubbling beyond the human intellect something way down deep and maybe by God's grace we need some of that amen maybe we need to have some of these difficulties and sufferings and some pains to come our way so that those witnesses can come up and give us the reassurance that we may not even have right now we always want to bypass pain but maybe it's through pain that we actually come to the thing that we long for so very much who doesn't want to be more like Christ do you know what it takes to become like Christ we always want the good but you can't have the good unless you're willing to endure the pain of the difficulty Parts there's just painful Parts it just is but if you love him it'll all work out don't worry about none of it it'll all serve its purpose in your life musicians will you come 1 Peter 5:9 says whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that with with that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who ha called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthen and settle you everybody in this natural life has problems everybody suffers loss difficulties rejections false accusations any human being will at some point in time experience any and all of those things but when they come to us we are not without a hope hope when they come to us they're there to mold us and shape us and to bring those Witnesses into view on our behalf amen and maybe at times if they're not in view it's just a time to go back to the Lord and say Lord I got off the path somewhere I don't know where maybe I took the path of least resistance I wasn't looking to Bear any cross I just wanted to live a comfortable natural life and if those Witnesses aren't present that's just what it means it's just time to go back to the Lord and get one-on-one with him reconnect with him get away from a religious walk and get back into a relationship with God God wants a relationship God wants to be loved God's looking for a wife someone who care for him think about him love him spend time with him I mean if my wife never spends time with me I question whether or not she loves me and if you never spend time alone with God and you think that you're Al your time or how do I say it nice I didn't mean to say that out loud I was thinking I think at times we substitute going to church fellowshipping with Christians as a walk with God sorry I believe brother Brandon preached is your life worthy of the gospel and is your life worthy of the Gospel it's a life that it's every day of every hour of every moment I'm in communion with him church is there to strengthen you help you speak to you encourage you to continue a walk every day with him that's what he wants the relationship will you stand sorry 8:45 I apologize Wednesday night I tried I tried sure love you all I bless you I hope it was an encouragement in some form and fashion and kind of maybe you know it's Christmas time and a lot of people have strong views to me if it's a day of celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ praise God we know it wasn't this time of the year but it's still people celebrating the birth of Christ and if it's an opportunity where once a year your family all gets together I wouldn't avoid it it's once a year and i' take every Advantage we can while we're still in these mortal bodies to be a living testimony for Christ a living witness of his grace of his power of His Mercy while yet believing that the same gospel that we believe that transformed us can transform them um if we don't believe then that we we don't have a solid rock that we're standing on and so After experiencing what I experienced last week I would say don't cut yourself off from your family your friends even those that rejected you or rejected things you've said in the past remember maybe they just rejected you maybe it wasn't the words maybe it wasn't accompanied with love hope and charity let's bring those Witnesses into view and see what they will do they can do a better time witnessing than you ever could with your words let them see a life that lives a life of Hope a life that really loves and a life that really has faith that God keeps his word why don't you let him read that in your life a little bit and see what kind of an effect that could have on the world around them let's just bow our heads and pray heavenly father so thankful Lord for your word word Lord in its Simplicity it's so encouraging Lord I so appreciate what you've done in my life and in the lives of so many here we all appreciate it beyond words that can fully express it and Lord I just pray that you would continually work with us we we're thankful for the chastising hand of God we know it's the tender hand of Jehovah and just as you brought pain and difficulties to bring natural Israel back to the land that they could be in their position to receive the Messiah Lord we welcome a tender hand of Jehovah in our lives at times to bring us back into a walk with thee and Lord I just pray that you would be with us in the coming days and coming events Lord as there will be no doubt many family gatherings and dinners and I just pray Lord that you'd help us to be true Witnesses for you I pray Lord that in everyday life that people will be be able to look into our lives and see faith hope and charity being manifested on a daily basis I pray Lord that you would forgive us Lord for letting so many things of this world distractions cares of life sometimes pains difficulties from from making contact with a lost and dying world around us father don't ever let us lose our feeling for people if we've lost our feeling for people we can never help them and so Lord I just pray that you'd be with us I pray Lord you'd be with brother Ron and brother Chad as they are traveling Lord bless the remainder of the meetings Lord mightily we pray and draw people into yourself Lord and Lord we're looking forward to Sunday's service Lord if you should Terry I pray you'd bless us As We Gather again Lord we're
