[8:05] understand then the
[8:07] Sher draws you
[8:10] closer there's something he wants you to
[8:17] see and he points back to the

[17:06] announcements we want to remember
[17:07] brother Emanuel saasu and his family

[17:24] for brother Jean as well and so brother
[17:26] Jean's starting to have brothers through

[17:30] think all of the ministering Brothers
[17:31] here are going to wind up over there in
[17:32] the next month or so so that'll be fun
[17:35] it'll be fun to go over there and see
[17:36] the work and so pray for uh brother
[17:38] Emanuel as he travels back and Brother
[17:40] Kyle and his family as they go next
[17:42] weekend also I want to let you know that
[17:45] this coming Sunday a week from today
[17:47] brother berley Williams will be with us
[17:48] so he'll be preaching for us then so it'
[17:51] be good to have him back uh the minister
[17:53] once
[17:54] again amen let's take a look now at the
[17:57] scripture in John chapter 10 and let's
[17:59] read from verse 27 John 10:
[18:05] 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know
[18:08] them and they follow me and I give unto
[18:11] them eternal life and they shall never
[18:13] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[18:15] out of my hand my Father which gave them
[18:18] me is greater than all and no man is
[18:20] able to pluck them out of my father's
[18:22] hand I and my father are one amen amen
[18:26] God bless you as you have your seats I'd
[18:29] like to preach this morning on a subject
[18:30] called our
[18:32] security and we find Jesus says that we
[18:36] are his sheep and he is our
[18:39] Shepherd and he he says he tells us that
[18:43] no man shall pluck us out of his hand
[18:47] now we are in his hand and nobody can
[18:49] pluck us out of his hand and then he
[18:51] says my Father which is which gave them
[18:53] me is greater than all and no man can
[18:56] pluck them out of no no man can pluck
[18:58] them out of my father's hand then he
[19:01] says I and my father are
[19:03] one so I think we're very secure in the
[19:07] hand of
[19:08] God and so I want to talk about our our
[19:11] security because the world is so
[19:14] uncertain and un insecure that I want to
[19:16] talk about where our security comes
[19:19] from and in the message of trumpet gives
[19:22] an uncertain sound the prophet said the
[19:23] national life is uncertain well the
[19:26] world is uncertain we're just living in
[19:28] a a place to where the whole world is
[19:30] having a nervous prostration look like
[19:32] shaking off every nation everybody one
[19:36] is afraid of the other and if I don't
[19:38] know if you heard the news or not but
[19:39] last night Iran launched an attack
[19:42] against Israel they sent a bunch of
[19:44] drones and missiles or whatever and and
[19:47] most of them were intercepted and and
[19:49] there's just a feeling all over the
[19:50] world as you never know what's going to
[19:52] happen next everything is tense and and
[19:55] there's there's war in Europe and
[19:56] Eastern Europe and there's war in the
[19:58] middle East and and there's tension all
[20:00] over the place but praise God we're in
[20:03] the palm of his
[20:04] hand I'd rather be secure in the palm of
[20:07] his hand and secure in some place on
[20:09] this
[20:10] Earth and so so I thank God for that
[20:14] brother bom he says in the message the
[20:16] uncertain sound from 61 he says your
[20:19] jobs you ain't got no security in your
[20:21] jobs I don't know how true this is but
[20:24] I've been told that there's more people
[20:25] out of work right now than there was
[20:27] during the time of President Hoover's
[20:28] dep
[20:29] because there's more people what's the
[20:31] matter it's just a place where there's
[20:33] no certainty in these things you're not
[20:36] certain of your job somebody can take
[20:37] your place in the morning politics let's
[20:40] just talk a while tonight this is
[20:41] Saturday night politics crooked both
[20:44] sides just so crooked as crooked can be
[20:47] it proved that in this last election
[20:49] when the FBI exposed that they had
[20:51] machines that every time you voted for
[20:52] Mr Nixon they had vote for M for Kennedy
[20:55] at the same time and they proved it and
[20:57] what did they do about it nothing
[20:58] nothing now I'm not Democrat nor
[21:00] Republican neither one I'm a
[21:03] Christian I agree with that statement
[21:06] amen the one pot can't call the uh the
[21:09] the pot can't call the uh call the
[21:11] kettle black or greasy one's just as
[21:14] black as the other one just as dirty as
[21:16] the other one but what's the matter it's
[21:18] because there's no security in those
[21:20] things it's played
[21:22] out a little further down he says don't
[21:24] care how much money you can make or how
[21:26] many buildings you can build or how much
[21:28] president you could come of any company
[21:31] it's falling
[21:32] crumbling the thoughts in my mind now of
[21:35] that third Angel's message that would be
[21:38] brother brenham's Ministry the third
[21:39] Angel flying through Heaven the third
[21:41] Angel's message that went forth Martin
[21:43] Luther John Wesley in the next Angel
[21:45] what did the last Angel's message say
[21:47] when he crossed the Three Angels Babylon
[21:50] is Fallen is fallen and become the
[21:52] habitation of every unclean Spirit
[21:54] that's EXA exactly where it's at we have
[21:57] no security in our
[21:59] Nation it's uncertain everywhere
[22:02] uncertainty there's uncertainty in your
[22:05] job uncertainty in politics uncertainty
[22:07] in Democrat Party uncertainty in
[22:10] Republican party uncertainty in all
[22:12] parties and in the church it's also
[22:16] uncertainty how can we have about 900
[22:18] different organizations and every one of
[22:20] them different one to the other and
[22:22] fussing with one another how can a poor
[22:24] lady know what to do how can the people
[22:26] know where to stand right praise God it
[22:30] I think he's Shing telling us that
[22:32] there's no uncertainty there's no
[22:34] certainty anywhere it's all uncertainty
[22:37] everywhere and this was 1961 when he
[22:39] made these statements so if we could
[22:41] just fast forward amen 60 whatever 63
[22:45] years now it's more uncertain than it's
[22:47] ever been the world is perilous the
[22:50] conditions are are are we're seeing
[22:52] extreme everywhere extreme in weather
[22:54] extreme in Politics Nation against
[22:56] nation of pestilences earthquakes in
[22:59] diverse places all the signs that we
[23:01] told we would see they're all
[23:05] present but we should be more secure
[23:08] than we've ever been when the world gets
[23:11] more insecure and there's more uh uh uh
[23:14] insecurity all around our security
[23:17] should be growing amen because our God
[23:19] Amen he's come on the scene in this last
[23:21] day and peeled back the great mystery of
[23:23] his word and open his book so that we
[23:25] can see he has a plan he's always had a
[23:28] plan and everything's worked according
[23:29] to his plan and nothing's out of plan
[23:32] and he's got everything under
[23:34] control and we should find ourselves by
[23:37] the grace of God in the palm of his hand
[23:40] amen and then we have nothing to
[23:43] fear praise
[23:46] God Jesus makes this statement in Luke
[23:50] 21 and there shall be signs in the Sun
[23:53] and in the moon and in the stars and
[23:55] upon the Earth distress of nations with
[23:57] perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring
[24:00] men's Hearts failing them for fear and
[24:02] for looking after those things which are
[24:04] coming on the earth for the powers of
[24:05] Heaven shall be shaken so men's hearts
[24:08] are failing for fear they're running to
[24:11] drugs and entertainment and and if they
[24:13] don't go to illegal drugs they're going
[24:15] to legal drugs through psychiatrists and
[24:17] all just to cope with the way the world
[24:19] is they fry their brains on
[24:21] entertainment and video games and
[24:23] YouTube videos and they're trying to
[24:25] keep themselves completely distracted
[24:29] because it's the only place to find any
[24:31] peace is distraction from the world
[24:34] right because there's no certainty in
[24:35] the world it's it's gone into
[24:39] chaos and uh when we want to look at
[24:43] insecurity we have to go back to the
[24:45] beginning so let's go to Genesis chapter
[24:51] 2 and if I speak from our Human
[24:54] Experience not from our Born Again
[24:56] experience but from our Human Experience
[24:59] I could say that we are all
[25:02] insecure every human being is born
[25:05] insecure and lives a life of insecurity
[25:08] amen because he lost his security at the
[25:11] fall and so he's born in sin he comes
[25:14] into the world he's shaping in iniquity
[25:16] comes through the world speaking lies
[25:18] he's alienated from the things of God
[25:21] and and his mind is darkened to the
[25:23] things of God and so how can there be
[25:25] any security so we talk about insecure
[25:28] people but in reality all human beings
[25:31] are
[25:32] insecure in Genesis CH 2 let's look at
[25:36] verse 8 said and the Lord God planted a
[25:39] garden Eastward in Eden and there he put
[25:42] the man whom he had formed so we know
[25:44] God by the power of the spoken word he
[25:47] created and and formed everything on the
[25:50] earth and what he was doing was
[25:51] reforming the Earth after destruction
[25:53] after a chaos and he was putting it in
[25:55] perfect order and when he got everything
[25:57] right amen then he had an Eden there
[25:59] which was which was his pleasure and
[26:02] then he built he made a garden Eastward
[26:05] in Eden and there he placed the man whom
[26:08] he had formed and this word Garden means
[26:10] an
[26:11] enclosure an enclosed Garden so what did
[26:14] God do God had the man in perfect
[26:18] security this is when man was Secure
[26:21] right here is when he was Secure he was
[26:24] Secure in everything God made everything
[26:26] was in harmony nothing was out the
[26:28] kilter nothing died no no animal ate
[26:31] another animal there would everything
[26:33] was in Perfect Harmony and unity and
[26:36] everything the Earth was
[26:38] Secure and God's son and his wife were
[26:41] secure why because Garden means an
[26:43] enclosure so where did God put him God
[26:46] put him in
[26:47] security he was in perfect security but
[26:50] we know that that man left he left the
[26:53] word of God and by leaving the word of
[26:55] God he was sent out of the garden and
[26:57] when he was sent out of the garden
[26:58] Garden he left his place of security and
[27:01] he be became
[27:04] insecure and let's look at Genesis 3 now
[27:07] Genesis
[27:09] 3 Verse 6 this is the Temptation in the
[27:14] fall it says in verse six and when the
[27:16] woman saw that the tree was good for
[27:17] food and that it was pleasant to the
[27:19] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[27:20] one wise she took of the fruit thereof
[27:23] and did eat and gave also to her husband
[27:24] with her and he did eat and the eyes of
[27:27] them both were open and they knew that
[27:28] they were naked and they sewed fig
[27:30] leaves together and made themselves
[27:32] aprons right here it
[27:35] begins because all of the sudden they're
[27:37] insecure about
[27:39] themselves they had been naked for how
[27:42] long I don't know how many years how
[27:44] much time had went on but they were in a
[27:47] place of security and innocency then
[27:49] brother B said they were under a veil of
[27:51] innocency and they weren't they weren't
[27:53] insecure about anything they weren't
[27:54] insecure about food they weren't
[27:56] insecure about shelter they weren't
[27:57] insecure about Safety and Security they
[27:59] W insecure about themselves in any way
[28:02] but the moment they fall all of the
[28:04] sudden insecurity comes and now they
[28:06] have to cover themselves and brother man
[28:08] tells they formed their own religion
[28:10] what were they trying to do they were
[28:11] trying to cover their
[28:12] sin but they did it by their own
[28:15] mechanism to cover their sin but even
[28:17] their covering for their sin didn't
[28:19] bring security amen it was a false
[28:22] security because you realize you know
[28:24] they they they had to make a covering
[28:26] now their eyes were open they recognize
[28:28] they were naked and we know the nature
[28:29] of the sin how that their eyes were open
[28:32] and so they made themselves aprons
[28:34] because aprons were an attempt to cover
[28:36] the sin amen but but but no matter how
[28:39] much they make believe that everything
[28:41] was all right and everything was covered
[28:43] as soon as the voice of God came walking
[28:45] in the garden amen they were really
[28:48] insecure so insecure listen everything
[28:52] begins in Genesis amen you start by
[28:54] leaving the word amen leaving perfect
[28:56] security you take your own decision and
[28:58] insecurity sits in when insecurity sits
[29:01] in then you try to find security in
[29:03] something you can do and a man-made
[29:05] security they attached that man-made
[29:08] security to them and no doubt made
[29:10] believe that everything was all right
[29:11] but in the presence of God Amen the
[29:14] insecurity that was buried in their
[29:16] heart could not be
[29:19] hid everything starts in
[29:23] Genesis that is what we're still living
[29:25] with
[29:26] today he goes on in
[29:28] verse n and the Lord God I'm sorry in
[29:31] verse 8 and they heard the voice of the
[29:34] Lord God Walking In The Garden in the
[29:36] cool of the day and Adam and his wife
[29:38] hid themselves from the presence of the
[29:42] Lord God this is the first time they've
[29:45] ever been insecure with their
[29:46] relationship with
[29:48] God there was a perfect Security in
[29:51] their environment a perfect Security in
[29:54] themselves and a perfect Security in the
[29:56] relationship with God but now now at the
[29:58] fall they were insecure in their
[30:00] environment they were insecure with
[30:02] themselves and they were insecure with
[30:03] their relationship with
[30:05] God and tell me what every human being
[30:08] is still dealing
[30:10] with the same
[30:14] thing and the Lord God called unto Adam
[30:16] and said Adam said unto him where art
[30:19] thou and he said I heard thy voice in
[30:22] the garden I was afraid because I was
[30:23] naked and I hid
[30:26] myself those are absolutely tragic
[30:30] words he had lost his security
[30:33] insecurity had set in and now the plague
[30:38] in humanity had
[30:40] begun we come into this
[30:43] world and we are
[30:47] insecure some of us suffer with
[30:49] different insecurities and more severe
[30:51] than others in certain areas but but we
[30:53] come insecure and as we grow older it
[30:56] becomes more and more evident how in in
[30:58] Secure we are because as we get older we
[31:00] try everything under the sun to bring
[31:03] security and it's all brings a false
[31:06] sense of security there's only one place
[31:08] to find security and that's in the palm
[31:10] of his hand it's the only place that
[31:13] will ever find a place for our heart to
[31:15] come to rest is in the palm of his hand
[31:18] nothing else will work when I looked at
[31:21] this uh uh term inse insecure I just
[31:25] went to the um uh Mariam web 's
[31:28] dictionary online and just got the
[31:29] definition so we'll begin to look at the
[31:31] definition and they break it into five
[31:34] different types first is a deficiency in
[31:38] assurance beset by fear and anxiety
[31:41] insecurity can be summed up by a
[31:43] deficiency in assurance and you're not
[31:46] assured of
[31:48] something Part B to this is not highly
[31:51] stable or well adjusted so you can be
[31:54] insecure in school you're not highly
[31:56] stable or well adjusted Ed you can be
[31:58] insecure in anything
[32:00] new number
[32:03] two not confident or sure it's
[32:09] uncertain number three not adequately
[32:12] guarded or sustained like unsafe not
[32:16] adequately guarded or
[32:18] sustained not firmly fastened or fixed
[32:22] like shaky something's
[32:25] unstable and number five
[32:28] unable to reliably afford or access what
[32:31] is needed to meet one's basic needs so
[32:35] like food security that the UN keeps
[32:37] talking about unable to afford or access
[32:41] what is needed to meet one's basic needs
[32:43] these are all different types of
[32:44] insecurity these are different ways of
[32:47] being insecure I should say it that way
[32:50] and so we find that we are all plagued
[32:52] with this in the human
[32:55] realm but I don't want my spiritual life
[32:58] to be plagued by this right there has to
[33:01] be a security that will do away with the
[33:05] insecurity and Christ is our
[33:08] security when I began to meditate on
[33:10] this I realized that that this is a
[33:13] plague amongst human beings so we can't
[33:16] anyone Escape it you can say well that
[33:18] person's insecure and that person is
[33:20] insecure and that yeah and so are
[33:23] you so I mean so what maybe somebody's
[33:26] is more obvious than yours but you're
[33:28] insecure too I guarantee it amen the
[33:31] only place that we can find our security
[33:33] is in Christ CU he is our security we
[33:35] won't find it anywhere
[33:37] else uh we won't find it in accounts and
[33:40] it's amazing how this world makes us
[33:43] insecure the news makes us insecure so
[33:47] if you have a news feed one of the
[33:49] objectives of news is to make you
[33:50] insecure because then it it brings to
[33:53] your attention the danger that's in the
[33:55] world there's either danger by car
[33:57] accident there's danger by natural
[33:58] disaster there's danger from other human
[34:01] beings there's danger from Wars there's
[34:03] danger in the environment there there
[34:05] the the news is constantly telling you
[34:07] you're in
[34:08] danger so the news breeds
[34:12] insecurity but the gospel is the good
[34:14] news amen and that good news brings you
[34:17] security that you're safe from all of
[34:20] these things and so we're we're
[34:21] surrounded by insecurity and what the
[34:24] news does and and what the government
[34:26] does and what everybody does is tell you
[34:28] you're insecure and then what they do is
[34:31] they bring a false sense of
[34:34] security you're insecure because when
[34:37] you get older you won't be able to work
[34:38] so we have social
[34:42] security you have a 401k plan we have
[34:45] this and that but really it's a false
[34:47] sense of security because there's no
[34:48] guarantee that it'll be there when you
[34:50] get there to need it amen and even if it
[34:53] is there who's who's to say it's enough
[34:55] and maybe you will never make it there
[34:57] or when you make it there it may not be
[34:59] there or when you make it there it may
[35:00] not be enough or or when you get there
[35:03] it may be enough money to sustain your
[35:05] life but will it save your children will
[35:07] it solve your problems will it take care
[35:09] no there's no security anywhere all
[35:12] these are human measures to find some
[35:15] way of bringing peace to a heart that's
[35:18] troubled we tried through laws and
[35:20] through regulations and through all of
[35:22] these things they're trying to bring us
[35:24] security amen it's amazing how much how
[35:27] much the the the world spends on defense
[35:31] spending I think it's so funny too
[35:33] defense
[35:34] spending America spends billions on
[35:37] defense spending when was the last time
[35:40] America had to defend its
[35:45] territory that's not defense
[35:48] spending they're the military arm of the
[35:50] Vatican they're going out trying to
[35:52] fight all the Vatican Wars it's not
[35:54] defense spending we have nobody
[35:56] attacking the United States
[36:01] it brings a false sense of security even
[36:03] the terminology brings a false sense of
[36:07] security we try to secure ourselves with
[36:09] tanks and missiles and ballistic
[36:10] missiles and that's no security unless
[36:13] the Lord keeps a house they labor in
[36:15] vain unless the Lord Keeps Us build a
[36:18] city they labor in vain that building
[36:19] unless the Lord keeps a house they labor
[36:21] in vain that
[36:22] watch so there's no security all these
[36:25] things are false measures of security
[36:27] trying to calm an anxious heart and it
[36:30] and is never going to work that's why
[36:32] the world becomes more neurotic all the
[36:35] time and I I think about how we pass on
[36:39] insecurity to one another in the
[36:42] simplest of ways I was I was just
[36:44] meditating because it's so easy to do
[36:47] you think if you have you take a parent
[36:49] you have a mother or father who's afraid
[36:51] of
[36:52] water they're going to P they're going
[36:54] to do their best to pass that insecurity
[36:56] onto their child
[36:58] they're terrified of water and every
[37:00] time that toddler starts running towards
[37:01] the water they scream they overreact
[37:04] they run they scoop them M they yell no
[37:06] no no don't you go near that and and and
[37:09] it may have been just a small amount of
[37:10] water no apparent danger no real risk
[37:13] the reaction was an overreaction and all
[37:15] of a sudden this little child it begins
[37:17] to realize that water's bad water's
[37:20] dangerous water is something Mom and Dad
[37:22] don't
[37:23] like and then as they get older you tell
[37:25] them it's dangerous and you could drown
[37:27] and then when they get little older you
[37:28] tell them all the stories of all the
[37:30] children who have
[37:34] drowned and you think you're keeping
[37:36] them safe you're not keeping them safe
[37:38] what you're doing is building an
[37:39] insecurity and actually it's dangerous
[37:42] because you won't let them experience
[37:43] water in a safe way so they can build up
[37:46] a they can overcome a fear and build up
[37:48] an ability to navigate through the water
[37:50] and not be terrified and be able to swim
[37:52] so that if they ever do happen to fall
[37:54] in the water all those stories of
[37:56] drowning are't in their mind and the
[37:57] terror of mom and they start thrashing
[37:59] around they can't swim they overreact
[38:01] they drown it was your insecurity you
[38:04] put on your child and you created a
[38:06] dangerous
[38:08] situation that's an easy that's that's
[38:10] an easy one that to look at but we do
[38:12] that with religion we do that with
[38:14] salvation we do that all the time we
[38:17] take our own insecurity and religion and
[38:20] we put it on our kids amen cuz we don't
[38:22] really have any peace so we'll clamp
[38:24] down on them cuz we can't overcome sin
[38:26] so all of a sudden we k all kinds of of
[38:28] legalistic restrictions on our kids
[38:30] because there's nothing in me that has a
[38:32] power to overcome sin there certainly
[38:33] can't be anything in you and I put my
[38:36] insecurity religiously on my kids and
[38:39] now they're afraid of everything in the
[38:40] world and God has no power to help
[38:42] anybody overcome any Temptation or
[38:46] luster it's a human insecurity but by
[38:50] the grace of God God is going to help us
[38:52] overcome that in this generation cuz
[38:54] he's provided everything we need and the
[38:56] fullness of of the word brought back the
[38:58] fullness of the spirit which brought the
[39:00] power to live the
[39:03] word
[39:06] amen praise God so we can
[39:10] overreact we can become too
[39:13] strict and it's all based on fear and
[39:17] insecurity and try to build a false
[39:20] security with a system of religion or a
[39:23] set of strict
[39:24] rules and it it's not going to work any
[39:28] better than the missile defense system
[39:30] is going to keep the bomb from Russia
[39:31] from falling in America
[39:35] right cuz the prophet already told us
[39:37] it's going to
[39:38] fall doesn't matter how much they spend
[39:41] on defense spending right right am you
[39:45] take a you take a mother or a father who
[39:50] hates
[39:51] peas detest
[39:53] peas you know you get a little baby food
[39:55] jar of peas and some brings that jar
[39:58] over and the first thing they say is oh
[40:00] she won't like
[40:03] that how do you know she won't like
[40:07] that so crack it open and you take a
[40:10] little bit out and you put it and as
[40:12] you're doing it you're making a yucky
[40:17] face it's your
[40:20] distaste not that
[40:23] child you make your face and
[40:27] what do you think that baby's going to
[40:29] do and then maybe the baby likes it you
[40:32] put it in the mouth but you know they
[40:33] can't work their tongue yet and they
[40:34] like they licking it but their tongue
[40:36] pushes it back out oh they don't like it
[40:37] I knew she didn't like
[40:41] it
[40:43] brother it's funny but it's not funny
[40:46] when we do it with religion it's not
[40:47] funny when we do it with other things in
[40:51] life you know what we need as parents we
[40:54] know what we need as ministers you know
[40:55] what we need as church leaders you know
[40:56] we need as Elders we need
[40:58] security we need security that comes
[41:01] from the word of God so that we don't
[41:03] keep passing religious security down and
[41:05] creating more insecurities by building a
[41:08] false sense of security that will never
[41:10] work amen we need the genuine we need
[41:13] the real we need to know that we're
[41:15] secure we need to be as secure as Israel
[41:18] was when God was the Watchman on the
[41:22] wall not because they had walled cities
[41:24] not because they had huge armies not
[41:26] because they had great fortifications
[41:28] they were just they were just slaves
[41:30] that were marching through a Wilderness
[41:31] amen but they had a chief
[41:34] Captain they had somebody that was
[41:36] watching over them that's the security
[41:38] that we
[41:40] need amen I was thinking uh uh I was
[41:43] meditating actually this morning I
[41:45] remember there was a time when I was an
[41:47] 18-year-old boy and I got a I got a uh I
[41:50] was working at a at a grocery store I
[41:54] was in Cincinnati working at a grocery
[41:55] store as a student in school in college
[41:58] and I was working as a as a a produce
[42:02] attendant and I was stacking the shelves
[42:04] and I don't know what I was doing
[42:05] probably rotating produce and I somebody
[42:07] came up to me from the front office and
[42:09] said Chad you got a call it's it's
[42:12] urgent and I went to the phone and it
[42:14] was my brother and he told me that my
[42:16] dad had just passed
[42:17] away and and instantly I mean you can't
[42:20] imagine what it was like going from
[42:22] moving produce around to getting a phone
[42:24] call from your brother he's weeping on
[42:25] the other end and I tell you that to
[42:28] tell you this for years I was terrified
[42:32] every time I got a phone
[42:34] call it did something to me that when I
[42:37] got an urgent call or somebody says hey
[42:39] somebody's trying to get a hold of you
[42:40] they need you to call back right now
[42:41] whenever there was that scenario
[42:44] something in me my heart would start
[42:45] beating fast I would get sweaty I'd
[42:47] start to get nervous in my stomach and
[42:50] there was nothing wrong there was
[42:52] nothing to be afraid of but because I
[42:54] had that tragic experience in my life
[42:56] now anything that was similar to that
[42:58] would cause a reaction in me I was
[43:01] afraid to answer the phone sometimes I'd
[43:03] overreact and run as fast as I could
[43:06] or but by the grace of God he worked
[43:08] that out of me and I'm thankful but you
[43:10] realize how easy it is for these things
[43:12] to come into our life amen and what we
[43:14] need is we need God to heal our hearts
[43:17] amen because we can't live life In Fear
[43:19] And Terror because we're in the palm of
[43:21] his hand nothing's going to happen I
[43:24] used to I after that happened I would
[43:26] actually after I got married and after I
[43:28] had children I would actually Envision
[43:29] what that call would be like coming from
[43:32] my for somebody calling about my spouse
[43:34] or one of my children and I would
[43:35] terrorize myself because it was an old
[43:38] wound an old uh trauma in my life but
[43:41] but praise God I have found my security
[43:44] in the word amen to overcome that so
[43:48] there are things that happen to us that
[43:49] we can't control we can't just say stop
[43:52] being
[43:54] insecure I'll try I mean I'll I'll do
[43:57] what I can I I'll I'll stop trying to be
[44:00] afraid of heights or afraid of water or
[44:03] afraid of a phone I'll try but you know
[44:06] no matter how much you try you can't
[44:08] just
[44:09] stop feeling
[44:11] insecure because the only way to stop
[44:13] feeling insecure is to all of a sudden
[44:15] feel
[44:17] secure so how in the world am I going to
[44:19] feel secure if I have no real
[44:22] security I'm going to have to find
[44:25] security but it's got to be real and
[44:28] genuine and everlasting and and it can't
[44:31] be it can't be uh it can't be a security
[44:35] that fails or is flawed or won't hold up
[44:37] so we have to find that security in the
[44:39] word of God and this is what heals our
[44:41] heart when we find in the word and in
[44:43] the scripture that God is faithful to
[44:46] his word and he's made precious promises
[44:48] to us that word can heal our heart and
[44:50] bring us a security that can help us
[44:52] overcome trauma in life overcome things
[44:55] that have happened in the past overcome
[44:57] things that are still troubling us
[44:59] you're not going to find it at a
[45:01] psychiatrist office you're not going to
[45:02] find it by jumping into entertainment
[45:04] and you're not going to find it by
[45:06] pretending it's not there you're going
[45:07] to only find it in the word of God Amen
[45:10] by the grace of God his spirit will come
[45:12] and make that word live inside of us and
[45:15] it'll bring a true genuine security to
[45:17] where I'm actually not at all afraid of
[45:20] a phone call and those thoughts never
[45:21] enter my mind anymore because I know
[45:24] everything's under control God knows
[45:26] what's going to happen and I don't have
[45:27] to be afraid of what will happen because
[45:29] God's got a time and a purpose for
[45:32] everything and if God allows something
[45:35] to happen it's the very best thing that
[45:36] could
[45:39] happen we got to come to that kind of
[45:42] reality it's that's got to be that can't
[45:45] just be something we say because you can
[45:47] say that all you want and then you'll go
[45:50] around acting completely insecure
[45:51] ringing your hands being nervous and
[45:53] upset so it's just words coming out of a
[45:55] mouth that doesn't that doesn't bring
[45:57] security when the Revelation strikes the
[45:59] heart that's what brings
[46:00] security right
[46:03] amen so we do this to one another all
[46:06] the time we do this to our children yes
[46:10] the government does it to
[46:12] us if we've had a bad Church experience
[46:15] and people in the church have heard us
[46:16] or our ministers heard us then all a
[46:19] sudden we don't want to trust church
[46:20] people and we don't want to trust the
[46:21] church and we don't want to trust
[46:23] ministers and and God can heal all of
[46:26] that amen because God has to have a real
[46:29] genuine church somewhere he has to have
[46:31] a real fful Ministry there's got to be
[46:34] if God set it up and told us to submit
[46:36] ourselves to there's got to be a real
[46:38] one somewhere and notice I didn't say a
[46:40] perfect one because there's not a
[46:41] perfect one anywhere but there's got to
[46:43] be a real one somewhere a real body of
[46:45] Believers that want to serve God and
[46:47] genuinely love each other a real
[46:49] Ministry that wants to serve God's
[46:50] people and Minister the pure word of God
[46:52] it has to be alive somewhere because
[46:54] it's the word of God
[46:57] so some of those things we have to get
[46:58] over we have to look at the word and say
[47:01] God I need some security from your word
[47:04] because I've been made insecure by past
[47:06] hurts of ministers past hurts from
[47:08] churches and the problem is we'll pass
[47:10] that right down to our children because
[47:12] we'll be reluctant to enter into
[47:13] Fellowship we'll be reluctant to receive
[47:15] from a minister and then we'll tell our
[47:17] children things like be
[47:21] careful be careful of what just be
[47:24] careful don't get too tied into the
[47:26] church
[47:28] don't don't be too
[47:30] trusting all of a sudden what kind of
[47:32] seeds have we
[47:34] sown you think God wants us not to trust
[47:38] in his
[47:39] word not to trust that he can
[47:45] provide we can't pass these things on to
[47:48] one
[47:49] another if there's anything I want to
[47:51] pass on let me pass on faith in the word
[47:53] of God confidence in Jesus Christ to
[47:55] keep me an absolute faith that God will
[47:58] keep his word no matter how many people
[48:01] fail God will keep his word if it didn't
[48:04] work 15 times it'll work the next time
[48:07] cuz God can't fail brother B said if I
[48:09] called a prayer line and every person in
[48:11] that prayer line died the next day I
[48:13] died that night the next day I'd have a
[48:15] prayer line pray for people cu the word
[48:17] Can't
[48:18] Fail it's not confidence in man it's
[48:20] confidence in
[48:22] God so there's so many things that
[48:25] create
[48:28] insecurity there's only one that I know
[48:30] of that creates security and that's
[48:34] Christ I want to go through some
[48:36] scriptures as we look at this because I
[48:38] I think we can find that everything that
[48:41] we have to be insecure about he is
[48:43] provided in the word and I'm going to go
[48:45] through scriptures fast that's why I did
[48:47] a PowerPoint today so I can go scripture
[48:49] to scripture so if you just keep your
[48:51] notepad have handy if you want these
[48:52] scriptures just jot them down amen
[48:54] because we're going to keep moving fast
[48:57] so I first want to look at what it means
[49:00] to be secure so we looked at insecure so
[49:02] what is secure this is the same thing
[49:04] out of Miriam Webster's dictionary
[49:07] online free from
[49:09] danger does Christ make us free from
[49:14] danger affording safety and they use the
[49:18] example a secure
[49:19] Hideway is Christ a secure
[49:23] Hideway trustworthy and dependable
[49:28] is Christ trustworthy
[49:32] independable free from risk of
[49:35] loss everything that I commit unto him
[49:38] will I lose it
[49:41] no two easy in mind being confident
[49:46] having
[49:48] confidence can I be confident in
[49:51] him assured an opinion having no doubt
[49:56] amen can he take away all my doubts can
[49:59] he give me his faith so that I have
[50:01] confidence in
[50:03] him assured that means a secure Victory
[50:07] I'm assured of overcoming I'm assured of
[50:10] being delivered I'm assured of being
[50:14] rescued and four able to re reliably
[50:17] afford or access what is needed to meet
[50:20] one's basic
[50:21] needs can he meet all my needs can he
[50:26] afford it or access it yes so we find
[50:30] that our security is found in
[50:34] him let's look at insecure
[50:39] again a deficiency in assurance beset by
[50:44] fear and anxiety a defici this is one
[50:47] that's amazing to me a deficiency and
[50:48] Assurance so if if my insecurity comes
[50:51] from a deficiency in assurance I have to
[50:54] find a place to get Assurance yes and
[50:57] that if I get Assurance it'll overcome a
[50:59] deficiency in assurance so if I can find
[51:01] Assurance then I'll be secure not
[51:05] because I do some mental
[51:07] exercise not because I say something out
[51:10] of my mouth not because I distracted
[51:12] myself with other things or I created a
[51:14] false uh protection from none of that
[51:17] will work because it can't get rid of
[51:18] the insecurity in your heart your bank
[51:21] account can't take care of that your job
[51:23] can't take care of that the government
[51:25] can't take care of that and your spouse
[51:27] can't even take care of that your mother
[51:28] and father can't take care of that your
[51:30] minister your pastor your church can't
[51:32] take care of that there's nothing that
[51:34] can take care of the insecurity in your
[51:36] heart everything else becomes something
[51:38] to put Security in that will fail the
[51:40] only thing that won't fail is Jesus
[51:44] Christ a deficiency in
[51:47] assurance not highly stable or well
[51:50] adjusted so this is where I want to
[51:51] start going through some scriptures
[51:53] because we want to find our security in
[51:55] the word Hebrews
[51:57] 10:21 and having a high priest over the
[52:00] house of God let us draw near with a
[52:02] True Heart in full Assurance of Faith
[52:05] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[52:07] conscience and our bodies washed with
[52:08] pure water let us hold fast the
[52:10] profession of our faith without wavering
[52:12] for he is faithful that promised where's
[52:15] my Assurance my Assurance is Faith where
[52:17] did I get Faith it was a gift from God
[52:20] and I have Assurance in faith I don't
[52:22] have Assurance in all these physical
[52:24] things but I have Assurance in faith
[52:25] that he who promised it cannot
[52:28] Fail 1 John 4:17 herein is our love made
[52:31] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[52:33] day of judgment because as he is so are
[52:36] we in this world there is no fear in
[52:38] love but perfect love cast out fear
[52:41] because fear had torment he that feareth
[52:43] is not made perfect in love we love him
[52:46] because he first loved us so what will
[52:49] take care of the fear in my heart the
[52:51] Revelation that he first loved me when I
[52:53] was unlovable before I deserved his love
[52:55] before I could do anything that would
[52:57] Merit his love he loved me first and
[52:59] because he loved me first he's gave me
[53:01] the capacity to love him back and that
[53:03] amen that will do away and dispel fear
[53:06] because fear is what brings insecurity
[53:08] so what will bring security the
[53:10] Revelation that he loved me
[53:12] first but what if I mess up he loved you
[53:14] while you were messing up he loved you
[53:17] in the midst of your messing up he he
[53:19] loved you before you knew that you could
[53:21] even do right before you even attempted
[53:23] to do right he loved you first that's
[53:25] why you love him and let that dispel the
[53:29] fear
[53:32] amen and we could go on and on and on
[53:35] through the Bible but I just grabbed
[53:37] just a couple scriptures for each one
[53:39] not confident or sure not being conf
[53:43] this is another insecurity another way
[53:44] we can be insecure not having confidence
[53:47] or not being sure you know this is a
[53:50] trag tragedy when it comes to the
[53:53] message we go to a message Church we sit
[53:57] we claim We believe We Worship but if
[53:59] we're not actually confident that it's
[54:01] the truth it's going to show up
[54:04] somewhere in our lives it there's no way
[54:07] you can't fake this you can't pretend it
[54:10] there'll be enough circumstances in your
[54:11] life that that'll pop out amen but we
[54:14] got to find by the grace of God a
[54:16] confidence and an assurance that this
[54:18] message is the truth and you can only
[54:19] receive that by divine revelation God's
[54:21] got to plan it in your heart and reveal
[54:23] himself to you CU this message is Christ
[54:26] amen and he must reveal himself to you
[54:28] that this is
[54:30] me and if we can't find that there's
[54:33] going to be a problem somewhere down the
[54:37] road in Jeremiah 31:3 it says the Lord
[54:40] hath appeared of old and said unto me
[54:42] and old unto me saying y have I loved
[54:45] thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore
[54:48] with loving kindness have I drawn thee
[54:51] why did God draw you because he he loved
[54:55] you with with an everlasting love not a
[54:59] love that Fades not one he can change
[55:01] his mind but he loved you with an
[55:02] everlasting love and because he loved
[55:04] you with an everlasting love he drew you
[55:07] how did you get here how did you hear
[55:09] the message how who who drew you did you
[55:12] bring yourself or did God bring
[55:14] you if he drew you then he loves you
[55:17] with an everlasting
[55:20] love Isaiah 30:15 for thus sayith the
[55:24] Lord God the Holy One of Israel and
[55:26] return turning and rest shall you be
[55:27] saved and quietness and confidence shall
[55:29] be your
[55:31] strength what am
[55:34] I what am I supposed to where's my
[55:37] strength come
[55:38] from in rest in quietness and
[55:42] confidence my strength doesn't come from
[55:46] action my strength comes from rest and
[55:49] confidence in God why because it's never
[55:52] my strength my strength is Never
[55:54] Enough the strength that I have in
[55:57] myself is never enough to accomplish
[55:59] anything to save myself to deliver
[56:00] myself to overcome anything that's not
[56:03] mine so I'm relying on his and how do I
[56:06] know where his strength is it rests in
[56:07] his word amen so I have to just rest
[56:10] amen and wait with confidence on him to
[56:13] perform his word and that's my
[56:18] strength Ephesians 3:11 according to the
[56:21] Eternal purpose which he purposed in
[56:23] Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have
[56:25] Bolden and access with confidence by the
[56:28] faith of him he has given us the faith
[56:31] that gives us boldness and confidence am
[56:35] it doesn't come it it doesn't come just
[56:40] by working it up amen boldness and
[56:43] confidence doesn't come by working it up
[56:46] it comes by confidence by faith of him
[56:50] that's his faith he's given to us it's
[56:53] not not just working up our faith but
[56:55] it's actually a gift of his
[56:57] faith and that's where our confidence
[57:00] comes and that's what gives us boldness
[57:01] and access with
[57:05] confidence 1 John 5 and this is the
[57:10] confidence that we have in him that if
[57:12] we ask anything according to his will he
[57:15] heareth us and if we know that he hear
[57:18] us whatsoever we ask we know that we
[57:20] have the petitions that we desire of
[57:23] him now there's no reason to have no
[57:27] confidence and not be sure why because
[57:29] I'm not looking at myself I'm looking at
[57:32] him he's the one who purchased he's
[57:36] purchased full all Redemption all that
[57:38] was lost in Redemption he purchased it
[57:40] back by his own blood I'm looking to his
[57:42] blood I'm looking to him I'm not looking
[57:44] to myself I'm looking at his word the
[57:46] promise he made me and my confidence now
[57:48] is in resting in him to perform his word
[57:52] if not we strain and we try and we press
[57:55] and we get more tired and more
[57:57] frustrated and more discouraged and and
[57:59] we start to our faith starts to wne why
[58:01] because we were trying to use our
[58:03] efforts to do something and our efforts
[58:05] will always collapse but our strength is
[58:08] in quiet
[58:10] confidence number three not adequately
[58:13] guarded or sustained being unsafe this
[58:17] is another insecurity not adequately
[58:19] guarded or
[58:22] sustained do we we know how risky life
[58:26] life
[58:28] is and there's danger all
[58:32] around but you're still in the palm of
[58:34] his
[58:35] hand remember when that tornado is
[58:37] barreling towards your house you're in
[58:39] the palm of his hand when that car is
[58:42] barreling through the intersection
[58:43] you're in the palm of his hand there's
[58:45] nothing that can take away from the
[58:47] security you have in the palm of his
[58:50] hand so not feeling adequately guarded
[58:53] or
[58:54] sustained in Philippians he says being
[58:57] confident of this very thing that he
[58:58] which ha begun a good work in you will
[59:01] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[59:05] here's the question has he begun a good
[59:06] work in you if he's begun it then it's
[59:09] guaranteed to the Finish Line he doesn't
[59:12] finish what he started if he started it
[59:14] he'll finish it there's no way that he
[59:16] can fail to finish what he started amen
[59:19] if if if he didn't start it then we we
[59:21] should be nervous but if he begun the
[59:23] work he's going to finish it what do we
[59:25] need to do we need to quietly trust in
[59:27] him and have confidence in him who will
[59:29] finish his own
[59:32] work Proverbs 810 the name of the Lord
[59:36] is a strong tower the righteous run into
[59:38] it and is
[59:40] Sav the name of the Lord we have his
[59:43] name because his name denotes his person
[59:45] his presence who he is and he's given us
[59:47] his name this day in fact we bear his
[59:49] name Mrs Jesus Christ we are in the
[59:52] Strong Tower of his presence of his
[59:54] person he's unfolding holded himself to
[59:56] us and we are locked in that Tower
[59:59] listen this message is not tapes and
[1:00:01] books this message wasn't somebody's
[1:00:02] idea this message is Jesus Christ the
[1:00:05] word the living word that has been
[1:00:07] restored to us in this day and it is a
[1:00:09] strong tower that we run into I'm not
[1:00:11] talking about a set of doctrines I'm not
[1:00:13] talking about a one man's preaching I'm
[1:00:15] talking about Christ the word that has
[1:00:18] made himself manifest in this end time
[1:00:20] that's the message if we talk about the
[1:00:23] message and you see a a Healing Ministry
[1:00:25] and you see a prophetic Ministry and you
[1:00:27] see books and tapes you're not even
[1:00:29] seeing the message yet you're seeing the
[1:00:31] mechanism God used to bring the message
[1:00:33] to us but the message is Christ restored
[1:00:36] back to his church to come in Union with
[1:00:38] his bride that is the message he is the
[1:00:41] message the message is he is here to
[1:00:44] unite with
[1:00:45] you and he is the word made
[1:00:51] flesh and he is a strong tower that we
[1:00:54] run into amen it's why this word can't
[1:00:57] fail in this
[1:01:01] generation we're not insecure or
[1:01:06] unstable I mean if you look at me in my
[1:01:09] flesh I
[1:01:10] am but if you look at the inner man you
[1:01:14] look at Christ in me there's no
[1:01:16] instability there's nothing unstable
[1:01:19] there's nothing unsecure it's all been
[1:01:21] secured from before the foundation of
[1:01:23] the world you can see how powerful this
[1:01:27] Revelation is and how much we need the
[1:01:30] revelation of the hour because if not
[1:01:32] we're going to be tossed about on on
[1:01:35] these on these waves that are rolling
[1:01:37] all around us and we'll be tossed up and
[1:01:39] down and we'll have no real security but
[1:01:41] our anchor will hold because our anchor
[1:01:43] is tied to the unmovable word of
[1:01:48] God if we have a different idea every
[1:01:52] day you know a double-minded man is
[1:01:54] unstable in all his ways we need to come
[1:01:57] back to having confidence in what God's
[1:01:59] given us and keeping our confidence
[1:02:02] rested
[1:02:05] there in Matthew 28 he says and Jesus
[1:02:08] came and spake unto them saying all
[1:02:10] power is given unto me in heaven and
[1:02:13] earth all
[1:02:14] power go ye therefore and teach All
[1:02:17] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:02:19] the father and of the son and of the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all
[1:02:22] things whatsoever I've commanded you and
[1:02:24] lo I'm with you all way even to the end
[1:02:27] of the world who's with you the one who
[1:02:30] had all power in Heaven and Earth given
[1:02:33] to him and he's with you to the end of
[1:02:35] the world am are you secure yes I
[1:02:39] believe you're secure do you always feel
[1:02:41] secure no that's why we've been trained
[1:02:43] not to trust our feelings but to be but
[1:02:46] to have faith in the word of
[1:02:51] God I got a feeling we're going to have
[1:02:53] to pass this test
[1:02:56] and we're going to have to pass it again
[1:02:58] and again and again where we stop
[1:03:00] relying on the way we feel about
[1:03:02] something and start looking at where our
[1:03:04] faith is in the
[1:03:06] word and put our confidence in him and
[1:03:09] put our confidence in the word and and
[1:03:11] because we could get tossed all about
[1:03:13] emotionally amen we're emotional wreck
[1:03:16] someday amen and we feel good and we
[1:03:18] feel bad and we feel like we have
[1:03:19] Victory we feel like we have defeat but
[1:03:21] we got to stop moving with the feelings
[1:03:23] and stay fastened to the word because
[1:03:26] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:03:27] overcome in this
[1:03:29] generation there's there's there's news
[1:03:31] coming so fast there's been never been a
[1:03:34] generation that gets information as fast
[1:03:36] as we get information and every tragedy
[1:03:38] that strikes anywhere can be can be sent
[1:03:41] to you and you can be notified of it
[1:03:42] within minutes of the tragedy and they
[1:03:44] can pile up one after another there's a
[1:03:46] flood somewhere an earthquake somewhere
[1:03:48] a war somewhere your grandma's sick and
[1:03:50] your great uncle just died and you can
[1:03:52] get all that the same day
[1:03:55] listen how in the world are we going to
[1:03:57] cope no wonder the world's going crazy
[1:03:59] they can't deal with this much negative
[1:04:01] information all the time oh and by the
[1:04:03] way interest rates are High houses are
[1:04:05] still expensive and the and it looks
[1:04:07] like the economy could collapse any
[1:04:11] minute
[1:04:12] yes we had to get to the place that says
[1:04:15] that that doesn't move me that has
[1:04:17] nothing to do with it amen that all may
[1:04:20] happen but I've never seen the righteous
[1:04:22] forsaken or God's seed begging bread I'm
[1:04:24] in the palm of his hand there's no
[1:04:26] insecurity in their news there's no my
[1:04:28] security is not the financial system of
[1:04:30] America or the world I I I'm not my my
[1:04:33] my my my my existence is not based on
[1:04:35] the government I exist because God wants
[1:04:38] me here to shine his light and as long
[1:04:40] as he wants me here shining his light
[1:04:42] nothing's going to take me off of this
[1:04:43] Earth and take me out of my position and
[1:04:46] the minute he's done with me and removes
[1:04:48] me I'll be glad for the exit ramp to go
[1:04:51] to the sixth Dimension I can't lose
[1:04:53] there's nothing that's going to hinder
[1:04:55] me what do do I have to feel insecure
[1:05:01] about the Creek's Rising the Creek's
[1:05:05] Rising let's move to Higher
[1:05:08] Ground And if I can't get to Higher
[1:05:10] Ground he's going to have to deliver me
[1:05:13] and if he doesn't deliver me he's taking
[1:05:15] me
[1:05:16] home where's the
[1:05:21] insecurity
[1:05:23] amen th this bride
[1:05:26] amen we may face more and more pressure
[1:05:28] as time goes on I I don't know and I and
[1:05:31] I I really don't want to uh uh project
[1:05:33] bad Omens but there's a lot that the
[1:05:34] prophet told us and it looks like things
[1:05:36] can get pretty tight and kind of squeezy
[1:05:38] and maybe pretty difficult amen and
[1:05:40] we're going to have to stop trusting
[1:05:41] feelings and quit looking to anybody
[1:05:43] else for
[1:05:45] security we got to get to the place
[1:05:47] where my husband is all that I need he
[1:05:50] provides everything for me I'm secure
[1:05:52] because he said I was Secure I rest cuz
[1:05:54] he told me to rest amen he told me that
[1:05:56] he's watching over me he's my shepherd
[1:05:58] I'm in the palm of his hand he's the
[1:06:00] Strong Tower I mean how many scriptures
[1:06:02] do we need to go
[1:06:04] through but you know what happens the
[1:06:06] very next time we get bad news every one
[1:06:08] of those scriptures just out of our mind
[1:06:10] and all we can think about is what kind
[1:06:12] of cancer was that they told me ciroma
[1:06:15] Comm Sama
[1:06:19] something and that's normal that's human
[1:06:23] you don't have to feel bad because
[1:06:24] you're trying to remember what thect
[1:06:25] told you but just don't dwell on that
[1:06:27] too long before you come back to the
[1:06:30] scripture and say but by his stripes I'm
[1:06:33] Healed that God will never allow
[1:06:35] anything to happen that he hasn't
[1:06:37] approved of first there's a purpose in
[1:06:38] all of this and
[1:06:40] I though I am tried I shall come forth
[1:06:43] this go why can't we just speak the
[1:06:46] scriptures and stop speaking Medical
[1:06:48] Science and stop talking about disasters
[1:06:50] and talking about all the negative
[1:06:52] things and how are you doing doing
[1:06:53] horrible this happen that happened the
[1:06:55] plant CL and and and and I lost my job

[1:07:09] lot but why can't we say praise God the
[1:07:12] plant closed I lost my job and I got
[1:07:14] bills due I can't wait to see what he's
[1:07:16] going to do this time because he made a
[1:07:18] promise to me I can't wait to share the
[1:07:21] testimony in the church I can't wait to
[1:07:22] tell you what what's going to happen
[1:07:24] amen and it drag drags on and it drags
[1:07:26] on and you get beat down and you get
[1:07:28] wore out but praise God Amen the
[1:07:31] testimony gets greater as time goes
[1:07:34] on Lord help that to be my perspective
[1:07:37] all the time that's the right
[1:07:41] perspective you say well sounds like you
[1:07:43] lost your mind praise God mind was
[1:07:46] defective anyways I think I'll take the
[1:07:49] mind of Christ over mind any
[1:07:52] day that's the one that's going to do me
[1:07:54] good and that's the is going to get me
[1:07:56] out of
[1:07:58] here praise God now let's look at this
[1:08:01] fourth definition not firmly fastened or
[1:08:03] fixed shaky are we on Shaky
[1:08:08] Ground
[1:08:12] amen praise
[1:08:14] God 1 Corinthians according to the grace
[1:08:17] of God which is given unto me as a wise
[1:08:19] master builder I have laid the
[1:08:22] foundation and another build it there on
[1:08:26] but let every man take heed how he build
[1:08:27] it there on for other Foundation can no
[1:08:29] man lay than that is laid which is Jesus
[1:08:32] Christ what Foundation are you
[1:08:35] on is it in any way shaky is it any way
[1:08:40] unstable if you're built on the
[1:08:42] foundation of Jesus Christ which the
[1:08:43] true church is built on then there's
[1:08:45] nothing shaky about your
[1:08:50] position praise God Ephesians 2:19 now
[1:08:54] now there you are no more strangers and
[1:08:56] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:08:58] Saints and of the household of God and
[1:09:00] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:09:02] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[1:09:04] himself being the Chief Cornerstone in
[1:09:06] whom all the building fitly framed
[1:09:08] together groweth into a holy Temple in
[1:09:10] the Lord in whom ye also are builded
[1:09:13] together for a habitation of God through
[1:09:15] the spirit are we on a good foundation
[1:09:18] we are on a good foundation the world is
[1:09:21] shaking brother said the world is
[1:09:22] falling apart let her fall apart it's
[1:09:24] going to fall fall apart but one thing's
[1:09:26] not going to fall apart God and His seed
[1:09:28] are not going to fall apart the word is
[1:09:31] not going to
[1:09:33] fail Matthew 16:16 and Simon Peter
[1:09:36] answered and said Thou Art Christ the
[1:09:38] son of the Living God and Jesus answered
[1:09:39] and said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[1:09:42] barjona for Flesh and Blood have not
[1:09:44] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:09:47] which is in heaven and I say also unto
[1:09:48] thee that thou art Peter and Upon This
[1:09:51] Rock I will build my church and the
[1:09:52] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:09:54] it
[1:09:55] what's the church built on on the
[1:09:57] foundation what Foundation The Rock The
[1:09:59] Rock of R the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:01] is the rock that the church has built on
[1:10:03] and it's unmovable unshakable amen it's
[1:10:07] not Te You the church has never been
[1:10:11] teetering always been secure in Christ
[1:10:14] he is our
[1:10:15] security remember Jesus told the parable
[1:10:18] of the man who built his house on the
[1:10:20] rock and the man who built his house on
[1:10:21] the
[1:10:22] sand and he likened the man who built
[1:10:24] his house on the on the Rock and see the
[1:10:26] waves came the floods Rose and the waves
[1:10:28] beat vly and the wind blew anden one
[1:10:31] house stood and one house fell because
[1:10:33] one was
[1:10:34] secure one was
[1:10:36] insecure the one that was insecure had
[1:10:39] no Foundation I mean it was on the sand
[1:10:41] that moves and shifts that's the ideas
[1:10:43] of man the ideas of man move and shift
[1:10:45] feelings move and shift if you're if
[1:10:47] your Christian experien is based on a
[1:10:49] Feeling or a sensation you had alone
[1:10:51] that's shifting
[1:10:53] sand but it must be based on the word of
[1:10:57] God Amen our feelings our emotions they
[1:11:03] change our ideas the ideas of groups of
[1:11:06] people they
[1:11:07] change but Christ never
[1:11:10] changes God said I am God and I change
[1:11:14] not and he said the one who built his
[1:11:16] house is the one who heard my
[1:11:20] word and did
[1:11:23] it it's simple the one who received my
[1:11:26] word and just surrendered to it and
[1:11:27] obeyed it that's the one whose house is
[1:11:29] built on this
[1:11:30] rock the one who had another idea or a
[1:11:33] better idea or a church system that had
[1:11:35] some other idea other than the obedience
[1:11:37] to the word amen that fell down in the
[1:11:40] time of storm but in the time of the
[1:11:41] storm the one that was fastened and
[1:11:43] attached to the word by obedience to the
[1:11:45] word that one stood the test of
[1:11:49] time I thank God he's restored his word
[1:11:52] yeah so that we're not guessing anymore
[1:11:54] we're not hoping but God in a prophetic
[1:11:55] Ministry to restore the word so that we
[1:11:57] know what he expects and what he wants
[1:11:59] and what we can surrender ourselves to
[1:12:02] so that we can be fastened to the
[1:12:09] Rock now we look at this fifth
[1:12:13] one unable to reliably afford or access
[1:12:17] what is needed to meet one's basic needs
[1:12:20] it's interesting so they talk about food
[1:12:22] security all time in the united nationes
[1:12:24] there's people with food insecurity they
[1:12:27] can't access they can't get to the food
[1:12:29] uh uh they can't purchase it but when we
[1:12:33] look at it for us unable to reliably
[1:12:35] afford or access what is needed to meet
[1:12:38] one's basic
[1:12:40] needs you know we may come to this place
[1:12:43] before we're out of
[1:12:45] here it's a possibility based off things
[1:12:49] that the prophet told
[1:12:51] us and you know what that little plastic
[1:12:54] card that you pull out of your wallet
[1:12:55] and use when you buy groceries that may
[1:12:57] not work
[1:12:59] someday and every government system May
[1:13:01] Fail and if it doesn't fail it may fail
[1:13:04] us because we won't be part of the
[1:13:08] system we're going to have to know where
[1:13:10] our substance comes
[1:13:12] from we're going to have to know who's
[1:13:14] been providing it all
[1:13:16] along never was your job it never was
[1:13:19] your account it never was your card it
[1:13:21] never was the government that's never
[1:13:22] what provided it those are the
[1:13:24] mechanisms God used to feed you and care
[1:13:26] for you but that God's not limited to
[1:13:28] those mechanisms when they go away he
[1:13:30] has mother other mechanism when Elijah
[1:13:32] lost his mechanism he sent Ravens when
[1:13:35] when the brook dried up he sent her to a
[1:13:37] widow woman God has never been without
[1:13:41] resources amen when Elijah was running
[1:13:43] away and there was no widow woman and
[1:13:45] there was no Ravens he just sent an
[1:13:46] angel to bake him some special
[1:13:49] cakes amen when when when Elisha the
[1:13:53] prophet was in Dothan and he was
[1:13:54] surrounded amen by the armies of Syria
[1:13:57] and and and his servant wakes up and
[1:13:59] he's and he's all nervous because we're
[1:14:01] surrounded by the Syrian Army Elisha
[1:14:03] wasn't worried at all amen he had
[1:14:05] nothing to feel insecure
[1:14:08] about amen why should Elisha feel
[1:14:11] insecure amen he could look out in the
[1:14:13] spirit and he could see surrounding the
[1:14:15] Syrian Army was another Army and it was
[1:14:18] angels and Chariots of Fire all upon the
[1:14:20] hillside he had nothing to feel insecure
[1:14:22] about Gazza couldn't look into the
[1:14:24] spirit ual realm so Gaza could only see
[1:14:27] in the natural and in the natural it
[1:14:28] looked like he was at risk it looked
[1:14:30] like he was in danger it looked like he
[1:14:32] was insecure but the truth is he was
[1:14:35] never in danger he was never insecure he
[1:14:38] was never at risk and that's what Elisha
[1:14:41] knew and brother bam told us he comes to
[1:14:43] a meeting and he says there's Angels
[1:14:45] lining the walls of this building and
[1:14:47] the question is can we look into the
[1:14:49] spiritual realm and recognize that the
[1:14:51] angel of the Lord encompasses about them
[1:14:53] that fear Him
[1:14:55] Amen in the times of trouble in the
[1:14:57] times of disaster in the times of fear
[1:15:00] amen you can't stop your body from
[1:15:02] reacting to a situation you can't stop
[1:15:04] the anxiety the adrenaline dumb you
[1:15:06] can't stop that that's just a natural
[1:15:08] reaction because you live in a natural
[1:15:10] body but as soon as you get a hold of
[1:15:12] your senses you have to say wait a
[1:15:14] minute
[1:15:17] flesh I know you're scared and I know
[1:15:19] you're reacting amen but there's another
[1:15:22] Power higher than whatever power we're
[1:15:24] facing and that's the power of God he's
[1:15:26] promised in his word and his word can't
[1:15:29] fail so listen here
[1:15:34] flesh you who wants to run away and you
[1:15:36] who's scared and you want to scream stop
[1:15:40] it sometimes we just have to know how to
[1:15:42] possess our
[1:15:43] vessel and not let our vessel possess
[1:15:46] us we've got we've got to learn how to
[1:15:49] rule and reign with Christ so we got to
[1:15:51] rule and Reign this little bit of Earth
[1:15:53] first before we rule in the m ium and
[1:15:55] sometimes you got to pull it back down
[1:15:57] and say wait a minute you're not running
[1:15:59] this show you're not leading our
[1:16:03] decisions I'm not following your
[1:16:07] lead you little terrified scaredy
[1:16:11] cat who are you talking to the one in
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:15] mirror you stop it right now yes because
[1:16:19] I put my trust in the Lord and he shall
[1:16:22] deliver me
[1:16:25] amen why do you think we keep facing
[1:16:27] trials and why do you think they keep
[1:16:28] getting more intense and why because
[1:16:30] we're in training friends we're learning
[1:16:33] how to depend on
[1:16:35] him we think that many times we think
[1:16:37] it's just a bunch of random bad things
[1:16:39] that happen to
[1:16:40] us and you're a child of God you're part
[1:16:43] of the economy of God part of the
[1:16:45] kingdom of God you're an attribute that
[1:16:46] was from his mind a part of himself that
[1:16:48] he's put in the flesh to manifest the
[1:16:49] word and something random just happened
[1:16:51] to you on something bad random random
[1:16:55] and bad and it just happened to
[1:16:57] you no see the Revelation brings us back
[1:17:01] to the
[1:17:03] truth Revelation just wasn't so that we
[1:17:06] can know the Bible better than every
[1:17:09] other every other denomination knows the
[1:17:11] Bible it actually must produce something
[1:17:13] inside of us it come to bring us Faith
[1:17:17] so that we know that these things are
[1:17:19] true we know it's true that I'm not in
[1:17:22] danger am am I having a trial absolutely
[1:17:24] Ely but he promised that there would be
[1:17:26] trials that's also part of the word he
[1:17:29] promised that a man that is born of a
[1:17:31] woman is a few days in full of troubles
[1:17:33] he told his disciples the world will
[1:17:34] hate you they will even kill some of
[1:17:37] you he never he never gave them a false
[1:17:40] understanding he told them you're going
[1:17:42] to be tried you're going to be tested
[1:17:44] there's going to be hard things that
[1:17:45] happen to you amen look at the Heroes of
[1:17:47] Faith in Hebrews 11 amen was God not on
[1:17:50] the scene was he not in control anymore
[1:17:52] no he was working his plan and that was
[1:17:54] part of of the
[1:17:55] plan but when bad things happen as he
[1:17:58] told when he when he we talked about on
[1:18:00] Wednesday when he told Peter or Paul the
[1:18:03] Apostle Paul am mean he had a horrible
[1:18:05] Affliction a messenger of the devil sent
[1:18:07] to Buffet him and he wanted it to go
[1:18:11] away I think you would
[1:18:13] too and when he sought God three times
[1:18:16] the Lord
[1:18:17] says basically I'm not going to take it
[1:18:19] away because of the abundance of
[1:18:21] Revelation I need you to stay humble
[1:18:26] but listen Paul my grace is sufficient
[1:18:30] for
[1:18:31] you don't worry about this ailment
[1:18:34] you've got an ailment it's going to stay
[1:18:35] there don't worry about this family
[1:18:37] situation it's going to stay there don't
[1:18:38] worry about that it may remain it may go
[1:18:40] it may remain but no whether it goes or
[1:18:42] remains don't forget his grace is
[1:18:44] sufficient for you too he'll give us the
[1:18:47] grace to pass through our trials why
[1:18:50] because they're part of him manifesting
[1:18:53] himself it's part of him declaring
[1:18:57] himself upon the
[1:18:59] Earth praise
[1:19:03] God so unable to reliably afford or
[1:19:06] access what is
[1:19:08] needed but my God shall supply all can
[1:19:12] you read that word all my God shall
[1:19:16] supply all your need according to his
[1:19:18] riches and Glory by Christ
[1:19:21] Jesus well God promised to supply all my
[1:19:24] need just remember all your need may not
[1:19:27] be a bigger house and a better job and a
[1:19:29] nicer
[1:19:30] car that may not be your need but he has
[1:19:35] promised to supply all your
[1:19:38] need I mean he's not going to fulfill
[1:19:40] the lust of the flesh pride of life
[1:19:43] that's not what he's here to
[1:19:45] do will he pour blessings on yes will he
[1:19:47] give us an abundance yes will he give us
[1:19:49] more than we ask how many can say that's
[1:19:51] absolutely the truth he gives more than
[1:19:53] you ask he showers bless he gives in
[1:19:55] abundance he does but he's not here to
[1:19:57] answer the prayer of lust of the eyes
[1:19:59] lust of the flesh pride of life he
[1:20:01] promised to supply all of your need then
[1:20:03] as a loving father many times he gives
[1:20:05] you in
[1:20:07] abundance and for that we say thank
[1:20:09] thank you but when he says no can we say
[1:20:12] thank
[1:20:14] you CU he's promised to supply all of
[1:20:16] our
[1:20:17] need Philippians he says be careful for
[1:20:20] nothing that word careful means anxious
[1:20:22] be careful for nothing but in everything
[1:20:24] by prayer and supplication with
[1:20:25] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:20:27] known to God and the peace of God which
[1:20:29] passes all understanding shall keep your
[1:20:31] hearts and Minds through Christ
[1:20:34] Jesus I love
[1:20:36] this he says don't be anxious for
[1:20:40] anything but in everything in prayer and
[1:20:44] supplication with Thanksgiving so you
[1:20:47] ask God you ask God to help then you
[1:20:49] thank him for his
[1:20:51] help let your request be made known to
[1:20:53] God and and the peace of God which
[1:20:55] passes all understanding shall keep your
[1:20:57] hearts and Minds what do he promised to
[1:20:59] give you maybe not the want you asked
[1:21:03] for but peace he will give
[1:21:06] you the peace which passes all
[1:21:10] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:21:12] Minds through Christ
[1:21:14] Jesus what does peace do it takes away
[1:21:19] insecurity peace takes away insecurity
[1:21:22] and he's promised to give us peace
[1:21:25] John 16:23 and in that day you shall ask
[1:21:28] me nothing verily verily I say unto you
[1:21:31] what whatsoever you shall ask the father
[1:21:33] in my name he will give it you hither to
[1:21:35] have you asked nothing in my name asked
[1:21:37] and you shall receive that your joy may
[1:21:40] be full does God want to provide he
[1:21:43] wants to provide does he want us to ask
[1:21:45] he wants us to ask Will We lack and be
[1:21:49] without I ask you a
[1:21:52] question insecure you become insecure
[1:21:55] when you don't have the funds or the
[1:21:57] access to things that you
[1:21:59] need well if I was looking at myself to
[1:22:01] provide everything I need I should just
[1:22:03] start feeling insecure right
[1:22:07] now but if I don't look at myself and I
[1:22:09] look at him to be the one that provides
[1:22:11] he's the one who told us that that don't
[1:22:14] don't seek after garments don't worry
[1:22:16] about reignment don't worry about all
[1:22:17] these things the Gentiles seek after
[1:22:19] that but consider the Lily it neither
[1:22:21] toils nor spin but Solomon in all of his
[1:22:23] glory was not AR raid like one of these
[1:22:25] amen look at the bird not not one of
[1:22:26] them falls to the ground that God
[1:22:28] doesn't know and they have no no
[1:22:30] material value if God looks after a bird
[1:22:33] what about
[1:22:35] you he wants to provide and I want his
[1:22:38] provision I want his provision more than
[1:22:41] all of my
[1:22:42] wants because my wants may come out
[1:22:45] wrong my wants may lead me astray my
[1:22:48] wants may come from the wrong motivation
[1:22:50] amen I want him to supply all my needs
[1:22:52] and I want him to be the one who decides
[1:22:55] what I
[1:22:57] need will I ask yes he told me to ask
[1:23:00] I'll ask and then I'll Trust I'll ask
[1:23:03] and trust him to
[1:23:04] give
[1:23:06] amen it's like when your child ask for a
[1:23:08] popsicle and you give him a
[1:23:13] carrot I remember we had little kids you
[1:23:15] know they were done eating you know you
[1:23:16] have vegetables there and you have some
[1:23:18] meat and you have all kinds of good
[1:23:19] things and I'm not
[1:23:21] hungry and then you let them know that
[1:23:23] we have chocolate cake I want a
[1:23:27] piece I thought you said you weren't
[1:23:29] hungry one of them told us one day well
[1:23:32] I'm not hungry for this food I'm hungry
[1:23:34] for that
[1:23:41] food you said you weren't hungry but
[1:23:43] you're hungry I don't want to be like
[1:23:45] that with what God's provided me I asked
[1:23:47] for something and he gives me the best
[1:23:49] thing I need we pray for comfort and
[1:23:50] peace and he gives us trials and
[1:23:52] tribulations amen because trials and
[1:23:53] tribulations are are better than Comfort
[1:23:55] or peace our Comforts are just beyond
[1:23:56] the river and when he gives me a carrot
[1:23:59] instead of a popsicle I want to say
[1:24:01] thank you Lord you provide all my
[1:24:05] needs praise be to God Amen what are we
[1:24:09] preaching about maturity yeah but it's
[1:24:11] such a simple subject and we're failing
[1:24:14] every day
[1:24:16] right amen my brother Chad this is so
[1:24:19] simple it's absolutely so simple and
[1:24:21] it's the hardest thing I've ever done in
[1:24:22] my life is to reing this flesh in to
[1:24:26] stop chasing security elsewhere and stay
[1:24:28] planted on the word and the word only
[1:24:30] and stop trying in my own measure and
[1:24:32] stop looking to someone else to save me
[1:24:34] and stay fastened to the word and trust
[1:24:36] God for everything I
[1:24:39] need I don't know about you but I need
[1:24:42] this
[1:24:43] lesson and need it again and again and
[1:24:46] again Amen brother Bon the message a
[1:24:49] true sign that's overlooked he
[1:24:51] says as I said a few Sundays ago
[1:24:54] I thought somewhere along the road it's
[1:24:56] not a fallout shelter it's a Fallin
[1:24:59] shelter where we fall into it headlong
[1:25:03] with all of our heart and all of our
[1:25:04] soul and all of our mind into Christ
[1:25:07] God's Ark of Safety people are looking
[1:25:10] for Fallout shelters I'm looking for the
[1:25:12] Fallin shelter I want to fall on that
[1:25:14] stone that was cut out of the mountain
[1:25:16] without hands I want to run into that
[1:25:17] strong tower and be saved amen I want to
[1:25:19] be found in Christ because how can you
[1:25:22] have any greater security than in in
[1:25:25] Christ amen and how can you have any
[1:25:28] greater Security in your heart than
[1:25:30] Christ in you the hope of glory you in
[1:25:33] him and him in
[1:25:35] you that's our
[1:25:37] security praise
[1:25:40] God John
[1:25:43] 14 he
[1:25:45] says these things have I spoken unto you
[1:25:47] being yet with you but the comforter
[1:25:50] which is the Holy Ghost whom the father
[1:25:51] will send in my name he shall teach you
[1:25:54] all things and bring all things to your
[1:25:56] remembrance whatsoever I said unto you
[1:25:58] peace I leave with you my peace I give
[1:26:01] unto you not as the world giveth give I
[1:26:04] unto you let not your heart be troubled
[1:26:07] neither let it be afraid he's giving
[1:26:09] true peace not the false peace not what
[1:26:11] the world offers but he gives us true
[1:26:14] peace amen
[1:26:18] amen oh praise
[1:26:22] God I I think I went the wrong way okay
[1:26:27] I want to go to one scripture I don't
[1:26:29] have it in my in my
[1:26:31] slides but if you turn with me to
[1:26:33] Ephesians chapter
[1:26:36] 1 brother BR makes a statement and I
[1:26:39] want to look at that statement that I
[1:26:40] want to read here from Ephesians chapter
[1:26:43] 1 and this comes from questions and
[1:26:46] answers in 1961 I don't even remember
[1:26:48] what the question was that was asked but
[1:26:50] I just pulled this little excerpt out of
[1:26:52] it and brother B says if you know
[1:26:54] noticed Paul in going down he always had
[1:26:57] trouble with the Corinthian Church he
[1:26:59] never found them that way he never said
[1:27:03] nothing about it to the Ephesian church
[1:27:05] he could teach them eternal security
[1:27:08] there's nothing about eternal security
[1:27:10] in the Corinthian Church they were
[1:27:11] always babies trying one's got a tongue
[1:27:13] one's got a PSAL isn't that right and so
[1:27:16] now he begins to parallel the Epistles
[1:27:19] to the Corinthians with the Epistles to
[1:27:20] the Ephesians and he shows how the
[1:27:22] Ephesians were more
[1:27:25] mature and in their maturity they
[1:27:27] weren't struggling about the gifts and
[1:27:29] they weren't arguing about ones of
[1:27:31] apollis and ones of this and ones of
[1:27:33] that and me and they weren't they
[1:27:35] weren't uh uh misusing the
[1:27:38] gifts and but he shows in Ephesians or
[1:27:41] in Corinthians and he types it with the
[1:27:43] Pentecostal
[1:27:45] move and he shows how they were just
[1:27:47] babies and they were just like all the
[1:27:50] steam was going out the whistle and none
[1:27:52] of it was getting into the wheels to
[1:27:53] move the train down the these are all
[1:27:54] things that he describes and so because
[1:27:56] the Corinthian Church was still uh
[1:27:58] focused on emotional things and signs
[1:28:01] and and wonders and and they weren't
[1:28:03] getting to the deeper things of God they
[1:28:05] were in this and they were arguing and
[1:28:06] they were fussing and he was dealing
[1:28:08] with them on this level but he couldn't
[1:28:09] deal with them on the level he dealt
[1:28:11] with them in the Ephesians the Ephesians
[1:28:12] he could take to a higher
[1:28:14] level and brother ties that with our day
[1:28:17] with the Pentecostal movement and and he
[1:28:19] he himself amen is trying to take the
[1:28:22] church back to Ephesians to the the
[1:28:25] beginning and brother M said there will
[1:28:27] be an Ephesians again in leoda so that
[1:28:29] means in the end we're going to go back
[1:28:31] to what the church was intended to be
[1:28:32] from the very beginning what Paul was
[1:28:34] setting in order when he was the Apostle
[1:28:36] to the first
[1:28:37] age and so when we come back to that we
[1:28:40] want to come back and see what the
[1:28:42] Ephesians had that the Corinthians
[1:28:44] didn't have the Corinthians had gifts
[1:28:46] but no real
[1:28:47] security because with all their
[1:28:49] manifestation of gifts they had
[1:28:51] infightings and they had insecurities
[1:28:53] and they had one there with his father's
[1:28:55] wife and they weren't dealing with they
[1:28:57] had all kinds of other issues going on
[1:28:59] and turmoil amen that he didn't have to
[1:29:01] deal with with the Ephesians the
[1:29:02] Ephesians he was taking to a higher
[1:29:03] order and that's where brother brandham
[1:29:05] came at the end of the Pentecostal uh
[1:29:07] the Pentecostal Revival and he was
[1:29:09] trying to take them back to what Paul
[1:29:11] taught and bring us to maturity and here
[1:29:14] in Ephesians 1:3 this is what Paul
[1:29:17] teaches blessed be the God and father of
[1:29:20] our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed
[1:29:21] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:29:23] Heavenly places is in
[1:29:25] Christ according as he has chosen Us in
[1:29:28] him before the foundation of the
[1:29:32] world what is the deeper things it's
[1:29:35] bringing an absolute security to The
[1:29:39] Believer by revealing to them their
[1:29:44] origin the Corinthians couldn't go there
[1:29:47] yet they were too tied up in the other
[1:29:50] things but the Ephesians he was trying
[1:29:52] to take them to a greater revelation a
[1:29:54] greater
[1:29:56] understanding and he goes on to say I
[1:30:00] want to read that again verse four
[1:30:02] according as he has chosen Us in him
[1:30:03] before the foundation of the world that
[1:30:05] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:30:07] before him in love having predestinated
[1:30:10] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:30:12] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:30:14] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[1:30:16] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[1:30:18] hath made us accepted in the Beloved
[1:30:21] what does this have to do with your
[1:30:22] works
[1:30:24] nothing he hath made us accepted in the
[1:30:27] Beloved if you've been accepted in the
[1:30:29] Beloved then you're secure amen why did
[1:30:32] he do that because he predestinated you
[1:30:34] to the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:30:35] Christ why because he chose you before
[1:30:38] the foundation of the world in him all
[1:30:40] of this goes back to God's desire and
[1:30:42] that's where our security comes from
[1:30:44] amen we live in a day where we've been
[1:30:46] returned back to what Paul taught back
[1:30:48] to the true security and that security
[1:30:50] goes all the way back to the mind of God
[1:30:52] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:54] before anything was spoken to existence
[1:30:56] before anything was created your
[1:30:58] security today is linked back to
[1:31:02] them and you're just as secure today as
[1:31:05] you were as an attribute in his
[1:31:08] thought this is what it means to they
[1:31:11] going to be in Ephesians again in leoda
[1:31:13] what does that mean there's a church
[1:31:15] that's coming back to what Paul taught
[1:31:17] coming back to the security of eternal
[1:31:19] security not in a false way where I'm
[1:31:21] Eternal secure and I can do whatever I
[1:31:23] want where the Baptist ruined it but
[1:31:24] through the real genu way genuine
[1:31:27] revelation of who you actually are who
[1:31:29] you are in the depths of your soul and
[1:31:31] what God had planned for you from before
[1:31:33] the foundation of the world so that we
[1:31:35] don't get tossed about like
[1:31:38] children so that we don't get moved by
[1:31:40] everything that happens where we can
[1:31:42] keep our feet planted on the rock of
[1:31:44] Jesus Christ the revelation of who he is
[1:31:47] in this generation and not run and not
[1:31:49] move and not get scared and not look for
[1:31:52] salvation from anywhere else but from
[1:31:54] the
[1:31:55] Lord that's what this Revelation is to
[1:31:58] do to us amen it's not for puff up it's
[1:32:00] not for knowledge it's not for argument
[1:32:02] it's to keep your feet planted on the
[1:32:05] word so that you don't move in every
[1:32:07] trial in your life because God knew this
[1:32:09] before the foundation of the world he
[1:32:10] knew I would be here he planted his seed
[1:32:12] within me he sent the water of the word
[1:32:15] to bring this seed to life I've been in
[1:32:17] the sunlight of this message growing
[1:32:19] into His Image what do I have to be
[1:32:21] afraid of and why do I have to run round
[1:32:24] scared he's known this before the
[1:32:26] foundation of the world that's what this
[1:32:28] Revelation in the end time is supposed
[1:32:30] to do to us bring
[1:32:33] security not insecurity not not you have
[1:32:36] to do this to be a believer and you have
[1:32:38] to do that to to be in the message and
[1:32:39] you have to have this but that all
[1:32:41] breeds insecurity but the word brings
[1:32:44] security that I am who I am by the grace
[1:32:46] of God and he's called me he's drawn me
[1:32:49] I'm in his hands he knew me before the
[1:32:51] foundation of the world he planted my
[1:32:53] feet beat upon a rock the rock of this
[1:32:55] Revelation and now I cannot be moved not
[1:32:58] because of what I've done but because of
[1:33:00] what he determined before the foundation
[1:33:02] of the world when he made me accepted in
[1:33:04] the
[1:33:05] Beloved I don't have to perform things I
[1:33:08] don't have to accomplish things I don't
[1:33:09] have to manifest
[1:33:14] things amen so many times that confuses
[1:33:17] people when we go to the works trying to
[1:33:19] man trying to prove we're a
[1:33:21] Believer so that we can feel secure that
[1:33:24] we're a
[1:33:26] Believer dress right talk right go to
[1:33:28] right places don't go to the wrong
[1:33:30] places but listen that's a natural
[1:33:33] outcropping of being a
[1:33:35] Believer those things cannot make you a
[1:33:37] Believer what that'll do is increase
[1:33:39] your
[1:33:41] insecurity first thing we do is come to
[1:33:43] the security of
[1:33:45] Christ by the revelation of his
[1:33:47] predestinated plan for our life and then
[1:33:50] stay planted there and let the fruit
[1:33:53] just come
[1:33:55] out you mean I don't have to dress right
[1:33:57] I don't have to I don't listen you were
[1:33:59] a child of God before you knew how to
[1:34:04] dress you were a child of God before you
[1:34:06] knew how to
[1:34:08] walk you just weren't born again you
[1:34:11] weren't awakened to
[1:34:14] it you don't have to do any of those
[1:34:16] things you mean I don't have to do
[1:34:17] anything things no you don't brother
[1:34:19] Chad what are you
[1:34:21] saying saying you don't have to but if
[1:34:24] you're one of them it's the natural
[1:34:26] outflow of being a child of God it's
[1:34:29] what happens to the children of
[1:34:31] God they have a life with Jesus Christ
[1:34:34] they have a hidden life they've been
[1:34:35] behind the veil they have communion with
[1:34:38] Christ amen they love him with all of
[1:34:40] their heart they are secure in him he
[1:34:42] manifests himself through them and
[1:34:43] there's signs and wonders and dreams and
[1:34:45] Visions amen there's words of knowledge
[1:34:47] there's prayers that are answered
[1:34:48] there's Supernatural events in their
[1:34:50] life all of that is an outcropping of
[1:34:52] being a Believer but none of that can
[1:34:54] make you a Believer amen what do we need
[1:34:57] first I first need the revelation of who
[1:34:59] I am and I need the understanding of
[1:35:01] where I came from and why I'm here and
[1:35:04] how secure I am in the thoughts of God
[1:35:06] so that I can stay rooted and grounded
[1:35:08] in this word and lay in the presence of
[1:35:10] the son and let him draw the fruit out
[1:35:12] of the seed amen and what will we do
[1:35:15] dress right talk right go to the right
[1:35:17] places have the right kind of family uh
[1:35:19] apologize when we're wrong repent when
[1:35:21] we fail come to church submit to
[1:35:23] Ministry have manifestations life we'll
[1:35:26] have all of those
[1:35:28] things cuz that's the
[1:35:30] result so Paul now the Apostle Paul now
[1:35:35] is telling the
[1:35:36] Ephesians this really is bigger than you
[1:35:40] this started before you came here when
[1:35:43] and before the foundation of the world
[1:35:44] he already chose you in him you've been
[1:35:47] predestinated to be I'm striving for
[1:35:49] adoption listen you were predestinated
[1:35:51] to be adopted
[1:35:54] not because you strived and climb I
[1:35:56] climbed that
[1:35:57] pyramid yeah okay when you hit the
[1:36:01] ground again let's
[1:36:02] [Laughter]
[1:36:04] talk you're not climbing anything he's
[1:36:07] drawing
[1:36:08] You by his own power because you're in
[1:36:10] the palm of his
[1:36:12] hand he goes on here read verse six
[1:36:15] again to the praise of the glory of his
[1:36:17] grace wherein Heath made us accepted in
[1:36:19] the Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[1:36:21] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:36:22] sins according to the of his grace
[1:36:25] wherein he hath abounded towards us in
[1:36:27] all wisdom and Prudence having made
[1:36:28] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:36:31] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:36:32] hath purposed in himself that in the
[1:36:35] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:36:37] might gather together in one all things
[1:36:39] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:36:41] which are on earth even in him in whom
[1:36:44] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:36:45] being predestinated according to the
[1:36:47] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:36:49] after the counsel of his own will in him
[1:36:52] his will he purposed he did he
[1:36:55] accomplished in
[1:36:57] him are you getting
[1:37:00] it amen verse 12 that we should be to
[1:37:04] the praise of his glory who first
[1:37:06] trusted in Christ in whom also in whom
[1:37:10] ye also trusted after that you heard the
[1:37:11] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[1:37:13] salvation and whom also after that you
[1:37:15] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[1:37:17] Spirit of Promise which is the earnest
[1:37:19] of your inheritance and to the
[1:37:20] Redemption of the purchased possession
[1:37:22] unto the praise of his
[1:37:25] glory question is are you
[1:37:29] secure I'll ask you in next
[1:37:33] question have you always been
[1:37:39] secure but I didn't feel
[1:37:41] secure was God waiting for your feelings
[1:37:45] before he finished his
[1:37:48] plan he formulated his plan before you
[1:37:51] could have feelings
[1:37:54] so your feelings won't change his
[1:38:00] plan let's look at the token he says
[1:38:02] we're not to come together to talk about
[1:38:04] the message we are come together to get
[1:38:06] in the message and the message is Christ
[1:38:10] he is the
[1:38:12] word and he is a strong tower that the
[1:38:14] righteous run into and are
[1:38:18] safe the message is Christ he is the
[1:38:21] word that's right we're not to get in
[1:38:23] into it get beneath it we are to get
[1:38:25] into it get beneath it yes sir that's
[1:38:27] what we're supposed to do he was not
[1:38:30] responsible for any person out from
[1:38:31] under the blood not one no matter who he
[1:38:34] was he was not responsible all had to
[1:38:37] take uh all had to take not only himself
[1:38:39] but his whole family they're only safe
[1:38:41] when the token was displayed we cannot
[1:38:43] feel safe until this token is displayed
[1:38:46] that's right you must come under this
[1:38:47] token God's holy spirit and it displays
[1:38:50] to you Jesus Christ because it comes and
[1:38:53] lives lives in you what is that that's
[1:38:56] his life what is that the seal that
[1:38:58] seals you to the day of redemption
[1:39:02] guarantee the earnest are you going to
[1:39:04] make it yes how you going to make it cuz
[1:39:07] he's deposited his life in
[1:39:11] here I'm going to read through several
[1:39:13] scriptures I found it very fruitful to
[1:39:16] read some of the things that David
[1:39:19] wrote David as you know was a man on the
[1:39:23] Run
[1:39:24] he had done nothing wrong but he was
[1:39:25] being chased now if we could put it in
[1:39:27] perspective David was being chased by
[1:39:30] the United States Army and the president
[1:39:33] hated
[1:39:37] him the president of the United States
[1:39:40] had a Personal Agenda against
[1:39:42] him and he commissioned the elite of his
[1:39:45] forces and his armies to hunt him down
[1:39:47] and go after him so the Navy Seals are
[1:39:49] on your tail
[1:39:54] could you possibly feel
[1:39:56] insecure would you maybe struggle in
[1:39:59] your flesh and not only that but you've
[1:40:02] done nothing but serve the president and
[1:40:04] you've won victories for him and you've
[1:40:06] done all the right things and you never
[1:40:08] mistreated him you always were right and
[1:40:10] he and he loved you in the beginning and
[1:40:12] now he turned on you and he hates you
[1:40:13] and you've been betrayed and your name
[1:40:15] has been slandered and you're being
[1:40:17] hunted down do you think that you could
[1:40:19] possibly feel
[1:40:21] insecure you're hiding in a cave cave
[1:40:23] and the Navy Seals are coming there's an
[1:40:25] Apache helicopter flying around looking
[1:40:27] for you and mean they've got night
[1:40:29] vision scopes and all of these things
[1:40:31] and
[1:40:32] and what do you think you would
[1:40:35] feel oh
[1:40:39] well so we want to put in perspective
[1:40:41] where David was when he wrote some of
[1:40:43] these
[1:40:46] Psalms Psalm 56 what time I am afraid I
[1:40:51] will trust in thee and God I will praise
[1:40:54] His word in God I have put my trust I
[1:40:57] will not fear what flesh can do unto
[1:41:00] me I hope you never have an Apache
[1:41:03] helicopter hunting you down but if you
[1:41:05] do this is still the
[1:41:09] truth the Navy Seals are after you if
[1:41:11] the Green Berets have been commissioned
[1:41:13] to come and find you this is still the
[1:41:17] truth amen Psalms 5611 in God have I put
[1:41:20] my trust I will not be afraid of what
[1:41:23] man can do unto me you know what creates
[1:41:26] a lot of our insecurity worried about
[1:41:28] other
[1:41:29] people what will they say what will they
[1:41:32] do will they try to take something from
[1:41:33] me will they say something about me will
[1:41:35] they accept me or do they not accept me
[1:41:37] will they promote me or not promote me
[1:41:38] do they like me or not like me and we
[1:41:40] get all kinds of insecurity about other
[1:41:44] people but we're not supposed to be
[1:41:47] afraid of what other people can do or
[1:41:49] say or think we put our confidence in
[1:41:52] God
[1:41:55] Psalm 9 the Lord also will be a refuge
[1:41:58] for the oppressed a refuge in times of
[1:42:00] trouble and they that know the name will
[1:42:02] put their trust in thee for thou Lord
[1:42:05] has not forsaken them that seek
[1:42:08] thee Psalms 125 they that trust in the
[1:42:11] Lord shall be as Mount Zion I believe
[1:42:13] that which cannot be removed but abideth
[1:42:17] forever as the mountains are round about
[1:42:19] Jerusalem so the Lord is round about his
[1:42:21] people from henceforth even
[1:42:24] forever so is he still round about his
[1:42:26] people like the mountains around
[1:42:27] Jerusalem
[1:42:29] absolutely but I can't see him neither
[1:42:33] could Gesa and that didn't matter one
[1:42:36] not whether he could see them or not
[1:42:37] they were there anyways I don't feel
[1:42:40] like I'm Jerusalem surrounded by the
[1:42:41] mountains of God I don't feel that way
[1:42:43] it doesn't matter what you feel the word
[1:42:45] says it and it's got to be the truth you
[1:42:47] are surrounded by the mountains of God
[1:42:53] Psalms 188 it is better to trust in the
[1:42:56] Lord than to put confidence in man it is
[1:42:58] better to trust in the Lord than to put
[1:43:00] confidence in
[1:43:01] princes what would that be the
[1:43:04] government magistrates leaders just
[1:43:07] trust
[1:43:08] God Proverbs 29:25 the fear of man
[1:43:11] bringeth a snare but whoo putteth his
[1:43:13] trust in the Lord shall be
[1:43:18] safe Proverbs 14:26 and the fear of the
[1:43:21] Lord is strong confidence and his
[1:43:23] children shall have a place of
[1:43:27] Refuge Psalms 1271 except the Lord build
[1:43:31] the house they labor in vain that build
[1:43:33] it except the Lord keep the city The
[1:43:35] Watchman waketh but in
[1:43:38] vain Psalms 121:2 My Help Cometh From
[1:43:41] The Lord which made Heaven and Earth
[1:43:44] well praise God who's your
[1:43:46] helper my helper is the one that made
[1:43:49] Heaven and
[1:43:51] Earth who do you have help you I've got
[1:43:54] the US government well I've got the one
[1:43:56] who made Heaven and Earth is my helper
[1:43:59] the Social Security Administration is my
[1:44:01] helper well my helper made the Heaven
[1:44:03] and the Earth who's your
[1:44:06] helper I'll take my helper over your
[1:44:10] helper amen
[1:44:14] amen in the latery in church days
[1:44:16] brother B says Matthew 4 where in Jesus
[1:44:19] is tempted of the devil he overcame the
[1:44:22] personal temptation of Satan by the word
[1:44:24] and by the word only in each of the
[1:44:27] three major trials that corresponded
[1:44:29] that corresponded exactly to the
[1:44:31] Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the
[1:44:33] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:44:34] the pride of life Jesus overcame by the
[1:44:37] word eve fell to the personal Temptation
[1:44:40] Of Satan by failing to use the
[1:44:43] word so what was the fall when it really
[1:44:46] comes down to
[1:44:47] it Jesus overcame by the word eve fell
[1:44:52] by failing to use the
[1:44:55] word you know we're coming right back to
[1:44:57] the same spot in
[1:44:59] Eden said the bride will be tempted by
[1:45:02] this she'll come face to face with the
[1:45:03] same Temptation that he was faced
[1:45:06] with what's that Temptation going to be
[1:45:09] it'll have something to do with either
[1:45:11] taking the word or not taking the word
[1:45:14] sticking with the word or taking some
[1:45:16] other
[1:45:19] thing the word has to become everything
[1:45:21] to us
[1:45:23] our confidence our deliverance our
[1:45:25] security our
[1:45:27] promise it's got to be where we place
[1:45:29] our
[1:45:30] confidence Eve fell to the personal
[1:45:33] Temptation Of Satan by failing to use
[1:45:35] the word Adam fell in direct
[1:45:37] Disobedience to the word but Jesus
[1:45:40] overcame by the word and right now let
[1:45:43] me say that this is the only way to be
[1:45:45] an overcomer also it is the only way
[1:45:48] that you can know if you are overcoming
[1:45:50] because that word can't
[1:45:54] fail we may feel like we're overcoming
[1:45:56] our trials but if we're overcoming our
[1:45:58] trials by our own mechanism and not by
[1:45:59] faith in the word it will fail the only
[1:46:02] way we can know that we're actually
[1:46:04] overcoming is by having confidence in
[1:46:06] the word of God and then we are
[1:46:08] overcoming but it doesn't feel like I'm
[1:46:10] overcoming but you're overcoming because
[1:46:12] you're putting your faith in the
[1:46:15] word amen I want to uh let's turn in our
[1:46:18] Bibles to Jonah chapter 2 let's read
[1:46:20] this
[1:46:21] together the Book of
[1:46:43] Jonah Jonah chapter
[1:46:47] 2 in verse one Jonah chapter 2 verse
[1:46:51] one when Jonah prayed unto the Lord his
[1:46:54] God out of the fish's
[1:46:57] belly now would you be nervous if you
[1:47:02] just got swallowed by a
[1:47:04] fish would you maybe have some anxiety
[1:47:07] and feel a little
[1:47:09] insecure this is where Jonah's at when
[1:47:12] Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out
[1:47:14] of the fish's belly and said I cried by
[1:47:17] reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord
[1:47:19] and he heard me out of the belly of Hell
[1:47:22] cried I and thou heardest my voice for
[1:47:25] thou Hast cast me into the deep in the
[1:47:28] midst of the Sea and the floods Compass
[1:47:30] me about all thy Billows and thy waves
[1:47:33] passed over me then I said I am cast out
[1:47:36] of thy sight yet I will look again
[1:47:38] toward the Holy Temple now look at Jonah
[1:47:41] Jonah is looking towards the temple
[1:47:43] because in the dispensations he's in
[1:47:45] Solomon had built a temple and in his
[1:47:47] dedication prayer he prayed God anybody
[1:47:50] anywhere in the world that's in trouble
[1:47:52] if they turn to look at this Temple cuz
[1:47:54] this is where you abide if they turn
[1:47:56] their attention to what to the word for
[1:47:59] the day where you abide if they turn
[1:48:02] their attention there then you'll hear
[1:48:04] from heaven and you'll deliver them and
[1:48:07] Jonah listen what what is Jonah doing
[1:48:10] he's not looking to a relic he's not
[1:48:12] looking Amen to a a building because he
[1:48:15] has no idea if he's north south east or
[1:48:17] west he has no idea where he's turning
[1:48:19] he's in a in the belly of a whale it's
[1:48:22] it's black he has no idea if he's up or
[1:48:25] down if the if the fish is swimming
[1:48:26] North or South how can he turn to the
[1:48:28] temple this isn't a physical turning but
[1:48:31] in his heart he's looking at the word
[1:48:33] for his day he's looking at where Christ
[1:48:35] abide and he's putting his confidence in
[1:48:38] the dwelling place of
[1:48:40] God because Solomon established this
[1:48:43] word and he believed this word and he
[1:48:46] believed what Solomon said and he stuck
[1:48:48] with the word for his day and God heard
[1:48:50] his prayer when he was in the the belly
[1:48:53] of a
[1:48:54] whale praise God hallelujah how do you
[1:48:57] think well how do you think God's not
[1:48:59] going to hear you no matter what
[1:49:00] circumstance what trial what's happening
[1:49:03] where do I turn turn to Christ who's
[1:49:05] Christ he's the Living Word that's
[1:49:07] living today this message that has been
[1:49:09] restored to us is a person that's come
[1:49:11] among
[1:49:13] us we don't look to buildings we're not
[1:49:16] trying to turn somewhere and pray in a
[1:49:18] direction we're looking to the one who
[1:49:19] has arrived in the fullness of his word
[1:49:22] his personal presence has come on the
[1:49:24] scene where to dwell within us amen he
[1:49:27] is here turn to that presence of God and
[1:49:30] say God I'm in trouble but I believe
[1:49:32] that your Prophet said that you're here
[1:49:34] to indwell your people and I'm looking
[1:49:36] to you
[1:49:40] Lord this is where Jonah's
[1:49:43] looking not with his physical eyes not
[1:49:45] turning in a physical Direction but in
[1:49:47] his heart he's looking to the word for
[1:49:51] his day
[1:49:53] and he says and I love how I want to go
[1:49:56] back and read
[1:49:59] this said verse three for thou Hast cast
[1:50:03] Me In The Deep
[1:50:06] yes I thought those was Men on those
[1:50:08] ship TI him up and three
[1:50:10] men Jonah recognizes who's in control of
[1:50:13] this whole
[1:50:14] thing Jonah has a much Superior
[1:50:18] Revelation he says Thou Hast cast me
[1:50:22] into the deep in the midst of the Seas
[1:50:25] and the floods Compass me about all thy
[1:50:29] Billows and thy waves passed over me you
[1:50:34] know what Jonah is doing Jonah is going
[1:50:37] to a higher Revelation in his prayer and
[1:50:40] he's just not wallering and crying what
[1:50:42] he's saying is Lord I know you had me
[1:50:44] sent here and I know I'm in the midst of
[1:50:47] your Billows and your waves you're in
[1:50:49] control of this whole
[1:50:51] thing that's what Jonah
[1:50:53] saying thy
[1:50:55] waves thy Billows and thy waves passed
[1:50:58] over me then I said I am cast out of thy
[1:51:01] sight yet I will look again toward the
[1:51:03] Holy Temple the waters compassed me
[1:51:06] about even to the soul the the depth
[1:51:08] closed me round about the weeds were
[1:51:10] wrapped around my head my goodness you
[1:51:14] want to talk about feelings and
[1:51:16] circumstances those are the
[1:51:20] worst I went down to the bottom BS of
[1:51:23] the mountains the Earth with her bars
[1:51:25] was about me forever yet hast thou
[1:51:28] brought up my life from corruption oh
[1:51:30] Lord my God when my soul fainted within
[1:51:32] me I remembered the Lord and my prayer
[1:51:35] came in unto thee unto thine Holy Temple
[1:51:39] they that observe lying vanities forsake
[1:51:41] their own Mercy what were the lying
[1:51:44] vanities the lying vanities was the
[1:51:47] whale's belly the weeds wrapped around
[1:51:49] his Heth and the the darkness The Depths
[1:51:52] the way they were all lying vanities
[1:51:54] what made them lying vanities because
[1:51:56] anything that's contrary to the promise
[1:51:58] of the word is a
[1:52:00] lie so the devil tells you you're in
[1:52:02] danger you tell the devil I can't be in
[1:52:05] danger I have a heavenly father who
[1:52:06] watches over me I have a shepherd and
[1:52:09] I'm in the palm of his hand what do you
[1:52:10] mean I'm in
[1:52:14] danger they that observe lying vanities
[1:52:17] forsake their own Mercy but I will
[1:52:20] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[1:52:22] thanks giving what's he going to
[1:52:24] sacrifice I'm going to declare
[1:52:28] Thanksgiving where in the midst of his
[1:52:31] trouble I will sacrifice unto thee with
[1:52:34] the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay
[1:52:35] that thou have vowed salvation is of the
[1:52:37] Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish
[1:52:40] and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry
[1:52:43] land I contest to you I have never been
[1:52:46] in a circumstance that
[1:52:48] bad I felt like I've been in bad
[1:52:51] circumstance I have never been in a
[1:52:53] circumstance that bad but if I ever find
[1:52:56] myself in a circumstance that bad may I
[1:52:58] do what Jonah did and said Lord I you
[1:53:02] cast me here I'm surrounded by what
[1:53:04] you've provided I'm here at your bidding
[1:53:06] I'm here at your leadership I I I I may
[1:53:09] have made mistakes I may have done wrong
[1:53:11] but you forsaw before the foundation of
[1:53:13] the world and I'm looking to the word
[1:53:15] that you've given to us and the the
[1:53:16] promises and I'm saying Lord come and
[1:53:18] Deliver Me Lord come and save me for thy
[1:53:20] glory Lord and thank you for keeping
[1:53:24] your
[1:53:26] word praise God thank you for keeping
[1:53:30] your
[1:53:31] word amen in the message Harvest time he
[1:53:34] says how different from Jesus he stayed
[1:53:36] with the word now the next few minutes I
[1:53:39] want to prove all these things true see
[1:53:41] by both nature and word bring this
[1:53:43] together this proves he was the word
[1:53:45] made flesh for bread he was the word
[1:53:48] made flesh for he reflected what the
[1:53:50] word only when he come into his
[1:53:53] temptation he used what only the word
[1:53:56] what did he reflect the word amen what's
[1:53:58] his bride to do she's to become the word
[1:54:01] and to reflect the word so what should
[1:54:04] she use in all of her troubles the word
[1:54:07] where should her confidence be in the
[1:54:09] word what what should she be declaring
[1:54:12] and praying or speaking the word this is
[1:54:15] what we're being trained
[1:54:16] for and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:54:19] revealed brother bam says he Pro
[1:54:23] proves his resurrection life then as he
[1:54:26] vindicates himself she the bride is
[1:54:29] independent from all others I love that
[1:54:33] that's where we need to
[1:54:35] be
[1:54:36] independent that we we don't need
[1:54:39] someone else's support to serve
[1:54:42] God he's all I
[1:54:44] need I do I want other support yes I
[1:54:47] want it did God provide it yes he's
[1:54:50] provided it but I don't want to get to
[1:54:51] where I need it if I need it he'll
[1:54:53] provide it if he doesn't provide it I
[1:54:55] don't need it that's right so we got to
[1:54:57] get our minds adjusted to the Perfection
[1:55:00] of God Amen and to God's sovereignty and
[1:55:03] say God I would love to have a friend
[1:55:05] but if you don't provide a friend you're
[1:55:06] all I need God I ask you for more
[1:55:09] Fellowship but if you see fit not to
[1:55:11] give it then you're all I need that we
[1:55:13] can ask for what we want ask for what we
[1:55:15] need but he knows what we
[1:55:18] need sometimes we need to be in
[1:55:20] Fellowship sometimes we need to be alone
[1:55:22] yes sometimes we need everybody who
[1:55:25] loves us not to call us for a week and
[1:55:28] leave us wondering why nobody likes us
[1:55:29] anymore and start feeling lonely and
[1:55:31] start feeling rejected and start feeling
[1:55:33] Outcast cuz sometimes that's where we
[1:55:34] need to be to we start thinking so God
[1:55:37] can start speaking to our
[1:55:38] hearts but when we get in that place we
[1:55:41] get desperate we start calling and
[1:55:42] reaching out and and really what God's
[1:55:44] trying to do and you call somebody they
[1:55:45] don't have time for you you call
[1:55:46] somebody else they don't answer the
[1:55:47] phone you call somebody else they just
[1:55:48] left on vacation and you wonder what's
[1:55:50] happening to me I'm being abandoned
[1:55:52] you're not being abandoned God wants to
[1:55:54] talk to
[1:55:56] you God wants you to know you don't need
[1:55:59] a friend all you need is me if I see
[1:56:01] that you need a friend I'll give you a
[1:56:03] friend when you need a friend but what
[1:56:04] you need more than anything is me you
[1:56:06] need a relationship with me you need
[1:56:08] time with me you need confidence in me I
[1:56:11] am all that you need and I'm the
[1:56:13] provider of everything you need and when
[1:56:15] you need Fellowship I'll give you
[1:56:17] Fellowship when you need a friend I'll
[1:56:18] give you a friend amen when you need
[1:56:20] Deliverance I'll give you Deliverance
[1:56:22] put your trust in
[1:56:27] me she is independent from all others
[1:56:31] she's an independent woman praise God I
[1:56:34] remember when I first read that and I'm
[1:56:35] like is she allowed to be like
[1:56:38] that she's not independent from Christ
[1:56:41] she's dependent on Christ but her
[1:56:44] dependency on Christ makes her
[1:56:45] independent from dependency anywhere
[1:56:48] else she's an independent woman a Great
[1:56:50] Speckled word that's different from all
[1:56:52] others you remember the Bible on that
[1:56:54] The Great Speckled Bird she had his name
[1:56:55] she had his life how did they speckle
[1:56:58] the bird they were both white and they
[1:57:00] pulled the head off of one bird and
[1:57:01] drained the blood out on the other bird
[1:57:03] and the other bird was speckled with the
[1:57:04] red blood and it flopped its wings like
[1:57:06] this and the blood cried holy holy holy
[1:57:08] as it bade the ground so Christ the dead
[1:57:11] mate put his blood his blood from his
[1:57:13] life into his carrying his blood crying
[1:57:17] holy holy holy unto the Lord it's an
[1:57:19] oddl looking bird sure it is but she the
[1:57:22] bride is identified by him and she is
[1:57:25] independent from all others he says that
[1:57:27] again she's independent from all others
[1:57:30] keep thee only under her as long as thou
[1:57:32] as you both live keep thee only to him
[1:57:34] the word no adultery not one sign of
[1:57:37] denomination no one sign of creed no
[1:57:39] adultery at all the word and him alone
[1:57:43] on Christ the solid rock I stand all
[1:57:45] other ground is sinking
[1:57:48] Sands then he says that's it Christ the
[1:57:50] word he was the word he is the word and
[1:57:53] the church becomes the word by him
[1:57:55] making her a part of him and that's the
[1:57:57] word again personally identified by him
[1:58:00] his property alone I love that nobody
[1:58:04] else has rights his property alone amen
[1:58:07] and so when when the devil tries to push
[1:58:09] you around or cause sickness to come on
[1:58:11] you or or cause you to have a want and
[1:58:13] need all you have to say is I am his
[1:58:15] property
[1:58:17] alone I don't have to worry about it I
[1:58:19] belong to him I've been bought with the
[1:58:21] blood of Jesus Jesus Christ I belong to
[1:58:23] Christ I am his property alone amen and
[1:58:26] he knows how to take care of his
[1:58:29] property his property alone she is
[1:58:31] Redeemed by him catch this she is
[1:58:35] Redeemed by him through him for him and
[1:58:39] for him
[1:58:41] alone that's right then what the devil
[1:58:44] is howling about that it's being
[1:58:46] revealed what does God what does the
[1:58:48] devil not want you to get this
[1:58:51] revelation of your
[1:58:53] security cuz he wants to use insecurity
[1:58:56] to move you and motivate you into
[1:58:58] leaving the word he does not want you to
[1:59:00] come to this security where you're
[1:59:02] independent from all others and his
[1:59:03] property alone and you've been redeemed
[1:59:05] by him alone not by your works but by
[1:59:07] his deeds you've been accepted in the
[1:59:09] Beloved by him that you were chosen in
[1:59:11] him that he paid for the price
[1:59:13] himself and that you're the recipient of
[1:59:16] all that and you're secure in him that's
[1:59:18] the Revelation he doesn't want you to
[1:59:19] get because he wants you to still have a
[1:59:22] need and still feel insecure so that he
[1:59:24] can manipulate your insecurity to move
[1:59:27] you away from the
[1:59:28] word but that's not why the message came
[1:59:31] in this day the message came to give us
[1:59:33] a real security a genuine Faith by
[1:59:38] Revelation in Christ so that you can
[1:59:40] become an independent woman independent
[1:59:43] from all
[1:59:44] others and you can be his property and
[1:59:47] his property
[1:59:49] alone he further down a couple
[1:59:52] paragraphs further down he says
[1:59:53] identified oh the devil is howling about
[1:59:55] this the manifested truth of the promise
[1:59:57] of this word in her alone they don't
[2:00:00] have the answer when Jesus come why
[2:00:02] didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast
[2:00:04] out Devils by the Finger of God who do
[2:00:05] you cast them out by see he stood
[2:00:08] alone and his church stands alone she is
[2:00:13] not hooked with
[2:00:15] nothing catch all this terminology she
[2:00:18] stands alone she's not hooked with
[2:00:20] nothing why cuz if you're hooked to
[2:00:22] something you can be pulled around by
[2:00:24] that if you're attached or tied to
[2:00:26] something you can be moved and
[2:00:28] manipulated by whatever you're attached
[2:00:29] or titied
[2:00:32] to and his church stands alone she's not
[2:00:34] hooked with nothing but he was
[2:00:36] identified by God being the body that
[2:00:38] God dwelt in and the church is
[2:00:40] identified by his body doing the same
[2:00:42] thing she is his body the manifested
[2:00:45] truth of his promised word for the last
[2:00:47] days and she and she alone stands by it
[2:00:51] that's why the devil is howling these
[2:00:53] great organizations to set up something
[2:00:55] to close her up they'll never do it
[2:00:57] she'll be taken up not closed up she is
[2:01:00] now risen and by the power of the
[2:01:03] Vindicated word promised to
[2:01:07] her why are we not afraid cuz I'm seated
[2:01:10] right now in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:01:13] Jesus I've been lifted up by the message
[2:01:16] of the hour and I have been there's a
[2:01:19] part of me that has been lifted above
[2:01:21] all of this trouble
[2:01:22] and secure in him
[2:01:27] already in the message Harvest time he
[2:01:29] says I trust now that the Lord will
[2:01:31] bless his word I'm a firm believer in
[2:01:33] the word and the word only just the word
[2:01:37] only and that's the message that the
[2:01:39] Lord has given me so what is the message
[2:01:41] the lord gave him the word only what do
[2:01:44] we need Christ and him alone as we close
[2:01:48] I just want to read two scriptures
[2:01:50] together let's go to Psalms chapter 3 31
[2:01:52] and read these two places in Psalms and
[2:01:54] then we'll
[2:02:01] finish Psalms chapter
[2:02:13] 31 Psalms 31 this is another Psalm of
[2:02:16] David Psalms
[2:02:19] 31:19 oh how great is thy goodness which
[2:02:23] thou has laid up for them that fear thee
[2:02:25] which thou has wrought for them that
[2:02:27] trust in thee before the sons of men
[2:02:30] Thou shalt hide them in the secret of
[2:02:32] thy presence from the pride of man Thou
[2:02:34] shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion
[2:02:36] from The Strife of tongues blessed be
[2:02:39] the Lord for he has showed me his
[2:02:41] marvelous kindness in a strong City for
[2:02:44] I said in my haste I cut off from before
[2:02:47] Thine Eyes nevertheless thou heardest
[2:02:49] the voice of my supplications when I CED
[2:02:51] Cried unto thee oh love the Lord all ye
[2:02:55] his Saints for the Lord preserveth the
[2:02:57] faithful and plentifully rewardeth the
[2:02:59] proud doer be of good courage and he
[2:03:02] shall strengthen your heart all ye that
[2:03:04] hope in the Lord be of good courage and
[2:03:08] he shall strengthen your
[2:03:11] heart sometimes our hearts are failing
[2:03:13] for fear but be of Courage Focus your
[2:03:15] eyes back on what's been given to us and
[2:03:18] let him strengthen our heart let's go to
[2:03:22] Psalm 27 and finish with this portion of
[2:03:25] scripture this is the psalm brother
[2:03:27] Brenham goes to when he preaches the
[2:03:29] Rapture
[2:03:30] message I think that's significant and I
[2:03:33] think that's
[2:03:34] powerful that when he goes to preach the
[2:03:37] Rapture this is the
[2:03:40] message that he comes through this is
[2:03:42] the portion of
[2:03:43] scripture so let's think about this in
[2:03:46] light of the end time the finality the
[2:03:49] time just before we exit this
[2:03:52] Dimension says the Lord is my light and
[2:03:56] my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord
[2:03:58] is the strength of my life of whom shall
[2:04:00] I be afraid where did brother Brandon
[2:04:02] read this at the beginning of the
[2:04:03] Rapture
[2:04:05] message maybe at the time of the rapture
[2:04:07] we need this kind of Revelation maybe we
[2:04:10] need to talk like this and act like this
[2:04:13] and believe like this the Lord is my
[2:04:16] light in my salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[2:04:18] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[2:04:21] whom shall I I be afraid when the wicked
[2:04:23] even my enemies and my foes come upon me
[2:04:25] to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[2:04:28] fell though a host should encamp against
[2:04:30] me my heart shall not fear the war
[2:04:32] should rise against me in this will I be
[2:04:34] confident one thing have I desired of
[2:04:36] the Lord and that will I seek after that
[2:04:38] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[2:04:40] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[2:04:43] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[2:04:45] have you got one request that's above
[2:04:47] all requests make that your greatest
[2:04:49] request that's what David said that was
[2:04:52] the one thing he wanted above everything
[2:04:54] else is to dwell in the temple of the
[2:04:56] Lord and inquire in his
[2:04:58] Temple verse five for in the time of
[2:05:02] trouble yes Rapture
[2:05:05] message for in the time of trouble he
[2:05:08] shall hide me in his Pavilion and the
[2:05:11] secret of his
[2:05:13] Tabernacle when the Green Berets are
[2:05:15] coming after
[2:05:18] me David knew what it was to be chased
[2:05:21] to be frightened to have his life in
[2:05:24] jeopardy to not know what tomorrow holds
[2:05:26] he's the one who understands this can we
[2:05:30] understand it when economic woses come
[2:05:33] when crisises pop up like when confusion
[2:05:36] comes around us for in the time of
[2:05:38] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[2:05:41] and the secret of his Tabernacle shall
[2:05:42] he hide me he shall set me up upon a
[2:05:45] rock and now shall my head be lifted up
[2:05:48] above mine enemies round about me
[2:05:50] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[2:05:52] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will
[2:05:55] sing praises unto the Lord hear oh Lord
[2:05:57] when I cry with my voice have mercy also
[2:06:00] upon me and answer me when thou sayest
[2:06:03] seek ye my face my heart said unto thee
[2:06:05] thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy
[2:06:08] face far from me put not thy servant
[2:06:10] away in Anger thou has been my help Le
[2:06:12] me not neither forsake me oh god of my
[2:06:15] salvation when my father and my mother
[2:06:17] forsake me then the Lord will take me up
[2:06:20] teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in
[2:06:22] a plain path because of mine enemies
[2:06:25] Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of
[2:06:26] mine enemies for false Witnesses are
[2:06:28] risen up against me and such as breathe
[2:06:30] out cruelty I had fainted unless I had
[2:06:33] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[2:06:35] in the land of the living DAV said I
[2:06:37] would have fainted unless I believed
[2:06:38] that God would come on the
[2:06:40] scene I had fainted unless I had
[2:06:42] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[2:06:44] in the land of the living wait on the
[2:06:46] Lord be of good courage and he shall
[2:06:48] strengthen thine heart wait I say on on
[2:06:52] the
[2:06:52] Lord who's our deliverer he's our
[2:06:56] deliverer when Paul and Silas were
[2:06:58] arrested were beaten were captives of
[2:07:00] the government were thrown into the
[2:07:02] prison and had their feet in
[2:07:05] stalks they did what David did I will
[2:07:08] sing praises unto their
[2:07:10] name they began to sing praises unto the
[2:07:13] Lord and Thanksgiving and worship they
[2:07:16] weren't boning they weren't groaning
[2:07:18] they were worshiping the Lord and one of
[2:07:21] the worst situations you can find
[2:07:22] yourself in what did God do he came and
[2:07:26] rattled that jail to
[2:07:28] Pieces he may not rattle your jail to
[2:07:31] Pieces but he'll give you Grace to go
[2:07:33] through and he might just rattle it down
[2:07:37] he might just perform the Supernatural
[2:07:39] and and and move mountains he might just
[2:07:41] move governments he might change
[2:07:43] policies he might bring provision from
[2:07:46] nowhere he might have something show up
[2:07:47] on your doorstep he might but is it any
[2:07:50] less a miracle
[2:07:52] that he plants his grace in your heart
[2:07:55] is that less of a miracle than somebody
[2:07:57] leaving a sack of groceries on your door
[2:07:59] when you need it or your car starting
[2:08:00] when you lay hands on it I don't think
[2:08:02] it's any less of a miracle when he gives
[2:08:04] his grace into your heart to give you
[2:08:06] the strength to go through what other
[2:08:08] human beings can't go through with joy
[2:08:10] and gladness and Thanksgiving Lord I
[2:08:13] think that's just as miraculous and just
[2:08:15] as Supernatural is all the
[2:08:17] other and that we can be thankful for
[2:08:21] when we go through dark days and tough
[2:08:23] times but yet there's a joy in our heart
[2:08:25] yet there's a song on our lips and yet
[2:08:27] we have confidence in him that didn't
[2:08:29] come from your brain that didn't come
[2:08:31] from your emotions that came from the
[2:08:33] father above and when you have that joy
[2:08:36] in your heart and a song and a
[2:08:38] realization that he will deliver you and
[2:08:39] a confidence in him then you realize I'm
[2:08:42] in the palm of his hand and you can sing
[2:08:45] his Praises you can call those things
[2:08:47] that are not as though they are because
[2:08:49] you know he will deliver
[2:08:52] am man let's all stand and musicians
[2:08:54] will
[2:08:57] come where is our
[2:09:00] security in Jesus Christ
[2:09:03] Alone just in
[2:09:05] him when I'm
[2:09:07] wrapped and weeds around my head and the
[2:09:10] Darkness and the under the Billows and
[2:09:12] under the waves and an impossible
[2:09:17] situation then why not just cry out to
[2:09:19] the Lord and say Lord lord I can't
[2:09:22] rescue
[2:09:24] myself and there's not another human
[2:09:26] being who knows what should be done in
[2:09:28] this
[2:09:29] situation the doctors don't know my
[2:09:32] friends don't know nobody else knows but
[2:09:35] I know before the foundation of the
[2:09:37] world you already
[2:09:38] knew and you know just what I need and
[2:09:41] you can supply my every need to go
[2:09:43] through this trial and you can move all
[2:09:45] the obstacles away so I'm turning my
[2:09:48] eyes to you and I'm looking
[2:09:51] to you and I'm trusting in you and I'm
[2:09:55] offering my sacrifice of Thanksgiving to
[2:09:58] you who is my deliverer my sustainer My
[2:10:01] Redeemer my healer and the strength that
[2:10:04] carries me through and I can praise you
[2:10:07] for all of that amen the devil would
[2:10:11] love for us to be
[2:10:12] insecure but this message came to bring
[2:10:15] us a
[2:10:16] security it came to make us stable it
[2:10:19] came to put us on a rock
[2:10:22] it came to make us an independent woman
[2:10:26] separated from all others his and his
[2:10:29] alone that's why this message came and I
[2:10:33] believe all the things we're going
[2:10:34] through is bringing us closer and closer
[2:10:37] to that position he knows what he's
[2:10:39] doing friends he knows exactly what he's
[2:10:42] doing and I just want to surrender to
[2:10:44] his will let's bow our heads together to
[2:10:48] pray dear heavenly father we thank you
[2:10:50] Jesus for this day you've given us for
[2:10:53] the word Lord it means more to us than
[2:10:56] anything God when we see
[2:10:59] the we see the Troublesome times that
[2:11:01] we're in and men's Hearts failing for
[2:11:04] fear mental illness drug abuse
[2:11:09] entertainment God all of it is
[2:11:12] escapism a desire for man to stick his
[2:11:16] head in a hole and hope that trouble
[2:11:18] passes but God We Know by your Prophets
[2:11:21] message that trouble is not passing it's
[2:11:26] intensifying Lord we recognize that this
[2:11:29] Earth has to be purged by fire Atomic
[2:11:33] and Volcanic and it has to bring forth a
[2:11:35] bright new world for
[2:11:37] millennium but God our confidence in you
[2:11:39] is that you'll rescue us before that
[2:11:41] time for you've promised it and whatever
[2:11:44] leads up to that we're trusting in you
[2:11:47] we're turning our eyes to you and saying
[2:11:49] my confidence is in you you're the
[2:11:51] Strong Tower that I've run to and am
[2:11:54] safe Lord I Thank you for giving us
[2:11:57] Security in your word for we can't find
[2:12:00] it anywhere else God those individuals
[2:12:03] that are among us who are still
[2:12:05] perplexed and
[2:12:07] frightened God they need their heart
[2:12:09] strengthened God things happen to us you
[2:12:12] understand you know you know what
[2:12:14] happened to me when I got the call of my
[2:12:17] dad dying suddenly I couldn't help
[2:12:20] myself Lord
[2:12:21] the fear came in but Lord you help me
[2:12:25] there's others that are here that have
[2:12:27] an insecurity a wound Lord that's still
[2:12:30] causing them problems but God your word
[2:12:33] has come to heal
[2:12:35] us there's some that have been through
[2:12:37] bad Church
[2:12:39] situations had horrible experiences with
[2:12:42] Ministries were neglected and abused by
[2:12:46] parents who are abused and neglected and
[2:12:48] maybe left by spouses
[2:12:52] on and it leaves something inside our
[2:12:54] heart of
[2:12:56] Flesh Lord and the devil would love to
[2:12:58] use that insecurity to control his your
[2:13:02] children but God I'm praying that by the
[2:13:04] power of your word ministered by your
[2:13:06] Holy Spirit may you bring healing to
[2:13:09] every one of those
[2:13:10] situations may you become our
[2:13:14] security may you heal us with the balm
[2:13:16] of Gilead may your spirit coup in our
[2:13:18] hearts like a dove and tell us that all
[2:13:20] is well just because we were hurt before
[2:13:23] doesn't mean we'll be hurt
[2:13:25] again Lord and in those hurts you're the
[2:13:29] one who carried us through we're here by
[2:13:31] your grace we're here because we were in
[2:13:33] the palm of your hand when we were being
[2:13:35] neglected when we were spoke evil about
[2:13:37] when we were abandoned you still had us
[2:13:40] in your hand we're here trusting in your
[2:13:43] word and loving you because of your
[2:13:45] abundant grace in our lives not because
[2:13:47] of our strength and not because anybody
[2:13:49] saved us but only because you saved us
[2:13:52] God we thank you for saving us we thank
[2:13:55] you for protecting us we thank you for
[2:13:57] bringing us to this hour and now we're
[2:14:00] putting our attention and focus on you
[2:14:02] and asking that you would strengthen our
[2:14:04] hearts heal our wounds and take away the
[2:14:07] devil's ability to use those hurts and
[2:14:10] insecurities to manipulate us
[2:14:13] anymore for father we want to be yours
[2:14:16] and yours alone we want to be
[2:14:19] independent we want to be your
[2:14:20] independent bride attached only to you
[2:14:24] and we want to be we don't want to be
[2:14:25] hooked to anything no past pain we don't
[2:14:29] want to be hooked to a past experience
[2:14:31] we don't want to be attached to a past
[2:14:34] relationship we want to be free to be
[2:14:36] yours and yours
[2:14:37] only God would you free us would your
[2:14:41] spirit come down now and move into the
[2:14:43] hearts that have been wounded and would
[2:14:44] you strengthen those hearts and may they
[2:14:47] sing your Praises for all that you've
[2:14:49] brought them through not contempt and
[2:14:52] hatred for what they
[2:14:54] experienced not that that that anger and
[2:14:57] bitterness for being hurt or wounded but
[2:15:00] may you replace that with a gratitude
[2:15:02] and a thankfulness for the sufficient
[2:15:04] grace that brought them through May they
[2:15:07] turn to you and recognize that you were
[2:15:08] a Shepherd that walked with them through
[2:15:10] the valley that you were the Shepherd
[2:15:12] that carried them when they couldn't
[2:15:14] walk on their own and that we're all
[2:15:16] here today because you've been a
[2:15:18] faithful Shepherd we're here because
[2:15:20] you've been watched we're here because
[2:15:21] you've been faithful we're here because
[2:15:23] of your
[2:15:24] love and now may you just pull all the
[2:15:27] bitterness and poison out of these
[2:15:29] circumstances and all that brings
[2:15:31] insecurity and may you pour your spirit
[2:15:34] in there and your love and your word and
[2:15:36] may we be founded and rooted and
[2:15:38] grounded on your word and the revelation
[2:15:40] of predestination and your Eternal will
[2:15:42] and purpose for our lives and may it
[2:15:44] push out all the poison of bitterness
[2:15:46] and all the agony and despair may it all
[2:15:49] go away and may it be replaced with a
[2:15:51] tremendous Thanksgiving in our hearts
[2:15:52] for all that you've done for us for you
[2:15:55] alone are worthy you're perfect you're
[2:15:58] worthy of our
[2:15:59] praise God as we move forward may we
[2:16:02] move forward without strings attached to
[2:16:05] hurts and pain to other people but may
[2:16:07] all those strings be cut so that we can
[2:16:09] be free to be independent in yours alone
[2:16:13] and may you Lord we recognize the Firm
[2:16:16] Foundation that we're standing on and
[2:16:18] recognize our security in you and may
[2:16:20] all those those little fear buttons that
[2:16:22] get pushed may they be pushed away so
[2:16:24] that we can have confidence in you alone
[2:16:27] you are our security you've always been
[2:16:29] our security we've always been secure in
[2:16:31] you we've never been in Risk you've
[2:16:33] always been watching over us God I say

[2:19:02] control he put that
[2:19:06] reassurance way down in my
[2:19:14] soul he's got it all in control I put my
[2:19:20] life
[2:19:24] I put my life in his
[2:19:29] hand in his
[2:19:33] hand my life In His
[2:19:40] Hands every road I walk
[2:19:44] down I know is in his place
[2:19:53] I put my life in
[2:20:01] his
[2:20:03] amen I was thinking about something
[2:20:06] brother Brenham
[2:20:07] said in his testimony one time he was
[2:20:10] talking about the death of his wife and
[2:20:12] his daughter and how hard that was for
[2:20:15] him and he didn't understand and didn't
[2:20:17] comprehend but he made this statement
[2:20:19] years later
[2:20:21] he said I didn't know then I didn't
[2:20:23] understand then he said but I understand
[2:20:26] now he' come to terms with something and
[2:20:28] he didn't he didn't go on to explain it
[2:20:31] completely but brother brandham at the
[2:20:33] end of his life he understood that that
[2:20:36] was all necessary in the plan of God for
[2:20:39] his molding for his shaping and his
[2:20:40] molding and shaping was my benefit was
[2:20:43] your
[2:20:44] benefit his training to stay with the
[2:20:47] word his training to to to not deviate
[2:20:49] off that word and not let anybody else
[2:20:51] influence him that training that he went
[2:20:54] through was for you and
[2:20:56] I brother B comes to the end and he and
[2:20:59] he's not bitter about losing his wife
[2:21:01] he's not bitter about losing his
[2:21:03] daughter and when he tells the story he
[2:21:04] still weeps of course he was hurt but
[2:21:06] he's no longer hurt and bitterness and
[2:21:09] anger and frustration towards God he's
[2:21:11] come to terms that that the fact that
[2:21:13] God did what was best and he didn't
[2:21:16] understand then but I understand
[2:21:19] now there's a lot lot of things in life
[2:21:21] that we don't
[2:21:23] understand why my parents abandoned me
[2:21:25] why somebody allowed this abuse in my
[2:21:27] life why know somebody didn't stop this
[2:21:29] from happening why God allowed it to go
[2:21:31] on when God can stop anything there's so
[2:21:33] many those things we deal with in life
[2:21:36] and those questions roll around and
[2:21:37] around in our heart but can we look to
[2:21:40] the predestinated plan of God and
[2:21:42] recognize that God has a purpose in at
[2:21:44] all that I don't understand why but it
[2:21:47] had to be that way for something in his
[2:21:50] Kingdom to work
[2:21:53] out my brother tell you don't know the
[2:21:55] pain you don't know I don't know your
[2:21:58] pain the only pain I can identify with
[2:22:00] is my
[2:22:02] own but I met a savior who can heal
[2:22:08] pain he allows things not because he's
[2:22:11] sadistic and not because he's lost
[2:22:13] control he allows things because there's
[2:22:16] something that has to be manifest and
[2:22:18] there's something we have to know and
[2:22:19] understand there's a lot of things I
[2:22:21] didn't understand then but I understand
[2:22:23] now I understand them now I can say what
[2:22:27] brother bandam said I may not have a
[2:22:28] full picture but there's things about my
[2:22:30] childhood I didn't understand but I
[2:22:32] understand them
[2:22:33] now when I was a little boy my parents
[2:22:36] divorced when I was 5 years old we were
[2:22:39] drugged from Pillar To Post I went to
[2:22:41] maybe 11 or 12 different schools before
[2:22:43] Junior High
[2:22:45] School uh my mom she was a manager for
[2:22:48] apartment complexes to make money we
[2:22:50] moved from one apartment to the other
[2:22:52] and we like I said drug from Pillar To
[2:22:54] Post we've had Blended families and
[2:22:56] mixed families and remarriages and step
[2:22:59] siblings and Dad remarried and we had it
[2:23:02] was chaos
[2:23:05] friends I didn't understand
[2:23:07] then but when I sit down in my office to
[2:23:10] talk to somebody who's had pain in their
[2:23:12] family divorce and rejection and
[2:23:16] abuse I now feel what they feel and I
[2:23:19] understand what they understand and I
[2:23:22] can give him hope and tell him there's a
[2:23:23] God that can overcome all of those
[2:23:25] things there's a
[2:23:27] healing amen I didn't understand then
[2:23:30] but I understand
[2:23:32] now why I had to lose my dad when I was
[2:23:35] an 18yearold boy I didn't understand
[2:23:37] then but I understand now God was
[2:23:39] separating me to
[2:23:41] himself and I'm not bitter about it I'm
[2:23:44] not angry I wasn't always that way I was
[2:23:46] hurt and I was angry and I was upset and
[2:23:49] and I was a rebellious as teenager and I
[2:23:51] was angry about and I didn't even know
[2:23:53] what I was angry about I was just
[2:23:55] mad but this message has done something
[2:23:58] to me friends it has put me back in his
[2:24:02] hand this message has made to me in my
[2:24:05] perspective it is made God God and the
[2:24:07] the one who controls all things and made
[2:24:09] him perfect in everything made him
[2:24:11] perfect in every part of my life this
[2:24:14] message to me the revelation of this
[2:24:15] word has put God back in the proper
[2:24:18] place in my understanding amen and has
[2:24:20] brought peace back to my heart and love
[2:24:24] and Thanksgiving and now I'm thankful
[2:24:27] for everything in my life because if it
[2:24:29] all had to come together to make the
[2:24:31] recipe that brings me to where I am now
[2:24:34] I can say thank you Lord Jesus for all
[2:24:36] of it cuz I'm so at peace in my heart
[2:24:40] with God and I know that he's in
[2:24:43] control friends I didn't say that just
