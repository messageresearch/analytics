[Music] lord wrong here you even are even so god lord jesus christ belongs to me my hallelujah praise the lord amen aren't you glad he's taking us away we're in the middle of the taking away he has come and we're in the process of going i'm so thankful for that amen so thankfully he's come our soul is already united with him he's already been in the invisible union we've already been in the marriage and we're just feasting on his word amen enjoying the fellowship with him amen looking forward to the going away and it's good to be here with you this morning while we're standing let's just take our bibles and look at matthew 22. just want to welcome sister heather stru i heard she was going to be here today is she here oh god bless you sister it's good to have you here it's been a long time so this is a real treat for us amen also once say congratulations brother jim and sister sharon on their 60th wedding anniversary god bless that was exciting to hear and we had known about it a few days ago and i thank god for his grace his abundant grace and i thank god he gives us examples to look to a man of what grace can do man let's read this scripture here in matthew 22 let's start at verse 34. but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying master which is the great commandment in the law jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets let's just bow our heads and pray their heavenly father we thank you lord for your word we pray god now as we could just yield ourselves into your hand we're asking lord that you would come down and do what man can't do lord that you would come down and take over an earthen vessel and human lips but you yourself by the power of your holy spirit would speak eternal words lord that would go into the hearts of your people lord that you would bring out fruit lord that's there that you would bring us into a greater manifestation of your life in this hour lord we pray you have preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you know i'll be seated for he's gone amen i just wanted to thank those who were able to make it out the last two days for the prayer time it was is always wonderful it's such such a good atmosphere and yesterday evening i was in here at the end praying and it was just so sweet and so special and so we appreciate all of that amen i want to announce a couple things that are coming up so you guys can be praying about that but here in about a week and a half brother kyle and his family and several of the youth group are going to be going up to the winter youth camp in edmonton in canada the one that brother eugene's church host brother kyle will be preaching there and i think we've got i don't know five six seven young people going up with them so that'll be they'll be leaving on march 18th and getting back on the 23rd so please keep them in prayer keep brother kyle in prayer for the services and all the youth that will be traveling that god will just watch over them and protect them and also the next day march 19th 19th through the 21st i'll be going away with the young single adults for the young single adult retreat over here in indiana so that'll be fun we pray that you ask that you pray for us for that we'll be ministering just to them and also we're going to start the first planning session for the camp so pray for that that benefits all amen so that sunday march 22nd brother john kedema will be preaching i'll be back we'll be back saturday night so we'll all be here in the service but brother john is going to take that service for us so we look forward to that say god bless you i also want to say i enjoyed the song special this morning it really touched me it's where god is leading me when things like that happen and you see the continuity it just is a blessing to me and so i appreciate it god's been dealing with me heavy in those things and so i want to share some of those things today i want to if i take a title i'd like to take a title of the love of god and the love of the brethren the love of god and the love of the brethren and we know that love is the capstone we've we've you know worked your way through the church ages and into the statue of a perfect man but when it comes time to cap it all off it's divine love it's this charity it's love and it's love in such a different way than we consider love that sometimes when we start to talk about it because it's been so misused the term love and even in christian circles it's been so abused that it's almost always referred to in the emotional way like love that feels good and i have a tingling sensation and there's a sweetness in my heart amen those are the effects of love amen but love this kind of love is not based on emotion it's not because this love doesn't change with the emotions and so it's a different kind of love this capstone love and when we go to start talking about it i know for a while just because the way it's been presented in the past through a denominational way and in my upbringing and even before years in the message the way it was presented it would i would kind of recoil from talking about love because it almost was this kind of sappy sweet you know you have to be i don't know just some old doting grandpa to have this kind of love but that's not this kind of love this love can be firm this love can be hard this love can be honest but this love is also a reconciling love it's also a brotherly it's it's a it's even higher than brotherly love but it's the love that gives us strength for brotherly love so so when we talk about this i want to look at two aspects of this same love the love of god and the love of the brethren and if we can go back and look at this scripture again together i want to draw something out of this and let's skip down to verse 36 matthew 22 and master which is the great commandment in the law so they asked him what was the great commandment so they wanted to know one thing but jesus told them two things because jesus not just answered their question but he used the question as an open door to teach a greater lesson because they just wanted to know the great commandment but jesus wanted them to know something else so this is important he said master which is the great commandment in the law jesus said unto them thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment so praise god we know what the great commandment of the word is is to love the lord to love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it this is where he's adding a bonus to their question this is so it's super important when we recognize jesus is doing this it means this is really really important he's not just answering their question but there's something else he wants them to get and he says the second is like unto it so it's it's like the first one and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets so the entire old testament all the law all the prophets are hanging on two commandments one is the love the lord thy god with all thy heart i'm going to read it because i'll get it wrong all thy heart with all my soul with all thy mind and the second is like to it love thy neighbor as thy self wow that's a lot harder than it sounds at first like that can be a memory verse you learned in sunday school but when it comes to life application and living that out that is much more difficult than it sounds at first because you have to love your neighbor neighbor as yourself praise god so that means you don't do anything to your neighbor you wouldn't do to yourself you don't think any foster your neighbor you know until you would do for yourself or the way you want them to do for you let's i'm just going to refer to the law i want you to stay here in the new testament because we're going to go to the book of mark but that this is taken out of the scriptures in leviticus 19 out of the law leviticus 19 18 says thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself i am the lord. so that's where this is drawn from but but it's amazing that the language he's using thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people and and you know let's let's just make this personal to us amen sometimes there's people that hurt us in our families and in churches and and all around amen and they're the people of god and it says do not avenge when we say well i would never avenge or hold a grudge [Applause] so this i mean to me the scripture is getting so tight on me now lately it's the way i look at the word the word is really it used to be that the word was so exciting that i could understand the word like it was so exciting like i see the truth i understand that doctrine i see serpent seed i when i see the oneness i really see it i see it and i understand it and there's something resonates in my heart and that was the exciting part of the word and we've been in that cycle me myself i've been in that cycle for a while where it's growing and growing in revelation and the revelations are so thrilling to my heart but then all of a sudden comes the life application of the word because god does not want theologians the message didn't come to make theologians god's not after our theology amen he wants a life so revelation should bring a life there should be a life that comes with the revelation of the word and it's so exciting amen and that's why you know this has been on my heart for a while and when brother aaron comes and preaches what he did i felt like this is just a continuation of that same thought that that that it's just god is looking for a manifestation of the word not just a knowledge of the word but we have to have a knowledge of the word and we want to know it and we enjoy knowing it and we enjoy revelation but revelation must translate into the literal life of jesus christ in a body and that we've come to the hour where it's no longer acceptable not to have the manifestation it's no longer acceptable to have a doctrine and have no life it's not going to work anymore this is the age of maturity amen and god wants a fully mature bride he's tired of playing with us in childish ways he's tired i mean he's no longer amen is he dealing with us as children we've had 50 some years to grow up in the message and he's not going to allow it any longer amen and he's going to tighten up and make sure we act like adults amen no fussing no fighting no bickering no avenging no holding a grudge against the brother amen we we're going to actually live like jesus christ it's going to happen there will be a bride on this earth that is the very reflection of his nature and his life will she have the revelation the word absolutely she will know this word she will know it forward and backwards but more than that she'll have the capacity to display it through a lived life every day that is the element that god is calling for that is what he's trying to draw out of his bride and he's put the word in and put the word in and put the word in and what does he want to get out he wants to get the life out to whom much is given much is required i was talking to a brother the other day and i mentioned this to a couple of brothers just something a word picture that i've had in my mind something the lord's been dealing with with me on and it's the fact that god's word is like granite because granite is one of the hardest substances on earth it's a stone it's a rock like the rock of revelation stone but i've been looking at granite and granite is so unchanging it doesn't change with temperature it doesn't change with time and so they'll make if you look at a uh in a laboratory or in a machine shop that's making precision tooling a tool and dive shop they have a slab of granite and they lay their parts and they measure their measuring tool off of that because granite doesn't change and god's word doesn't change and it's hard i'm telling you god's word is hard brother branham said you know god's not like a doting old grandpa just let you do anything you want that's the truth god's word is hard it does not flex for you it doesn't matter who you are his word will not flex for you and this this stone that we're talking about is the stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands and then in the scripture then that stone falls on the image of the beast which is man's idea mixed religion man mixing his ideas with god's word that's what this image represents and he smashes it in the feet and grinds it into powder and blows it like the chaff in the wind a total destruction because the word smites it but there are those who will fall on this stone and be broken so whenever you come in contact with the word you will break it'll either break you or you'll be broken on it it'll either be involuntary or voluntary but you're going to be broken by this word it'll break your ideas it'll break your concepts it'll break i mean it'll break your flawed character it'll break your complexes this word will break you and i said god i want to voluntarily throw myself on the stone and be broken so that you can put me together the way you want me by your word because he's not going to flex the word to make it more accommodating to us because somehow he's a doting old grandpa that doesn't want us to suffer no suffering is part of the games if you suffer with him you'll reign with him he's never tried to avoid suffering for us that's never been part of god's plan to bypass suffering amen part of his plan is that you'll go right through suffering so you can be molded so you and i can be molded into the character of christ so when we come in contact we just recognize now that this word will not change this whole world is going to change to match god's word we get the first taste of it in the millennium when christ rules with a rod of iron but the perfect taste comes in the new heavens and new earth when everything's refashioned according to his design so this everything that we know is going to be broken by this word amen that's why we come in contact with it and and we we sometimes think that that it's going to work out all right and just because judgment's delayed doesn't mean judgment's not coming just because he hasn't spanked us yet doesn't mean he's not spanking us praise god but the children of god want it they're such a weird group of people they're so strange to the common thinking because they said thy rod and my staff they comfort me i'm comfort in knowing that you will break off of me anything that's not like you and it may not be comfortable i may not enjoy the process but it's the desire of my heart to be like him the desire of my heart is to be pleasing to him so his rod and his staff they comfort me let's turn over here and look at mark 12. we're going to pick up the same thing in scripture but i want to look at the terminology here same thing the answer asked a question and in mark chapter 12 verse 29 jesus is going to answer the question and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hero israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart by thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these wow jesus said it so we believe it there is none other commandment greater than these so if i'm going to live the word i must start with number one and number two you realize this is more important than not cutting your hair this is more important this is these these there's no greater commandments than these two that doesn't mean we you know until i get these right i might as well trim my hair that's not what we mean you know that's not what i mean but we can put the wrong emphasis and we put importance on the wrong things and make some things more important than other things but when jesus tells us there is none greater commandments than these two commandments that you love the lord thy god with all your heart with all your mind with all your soul with all your strength and that you love your neighbor as yourself and he said there's all the law and the prophets rest on this and there's no greater commandments than these hallelujah praise god there's this this word love that's used here i've we've talked about this many times this is not new to you but i just want to bring it in the context that we're in now this word love not being an emotional uh type of thing there's a section in the in the concordance that there's a a greek scholar who talks about this word agape it matches the same thing brother branham taught us but i want to use this here for the wording that he has says the verb agapen is the love of intelligence reason and comprehension coupled with the corresponding purpose i just i've read that to you before but it means so much to me this is based off revelation and understanding the word this is a love that's based on knowing who you are knowing who god is and knowing what he's trying to do right it's not fickle and tossed around by somebody said this and i'm hurt no they were nice to me and now i love them and it's not that kind it's not that at all it's so much higher than that because it's based off understanding god and understanding god's word now gives me the capacity to love the way god can love it says i'm going to read it again the verb agapen is the love of intelligence reason and comprehension coupled with the corresponding purpose in this its content is vastly outranks the other type of love infilian expresses the love of mere personal affection or liking including even the passions where the context requires and no intelligence or high purpose is involved this content places the verb on a on a low level it could never be said of god that hephilii or what brother man calls philio love the sinful world as far as phillian is concerned he could only abominate the foul world jesus never asked us to love our enemies in the sense of filian he never himself loved his enemies in that way but agape and yes with this love did god love the world and we can love our enemies comprehending all that is wrong sanctifying the world converting our enemies amen praise god that's it that's all i want to read in that so so the whole point here is that there's a higher level of understanding that gives us the capacity to love like god loves because we understand like like when you look out and and jesus looked out over the crowd and he had compassion on them they had been doing things that were wrong and no doubt believing things that were wrong but he had compassion on them because they were scattered like a sheep with no shepherd like he understood why they're in the condition they're in like when we begin to see the world and the churches and the condition they're in i mean there's a higher level of understanding where we say i understand why they're in the condition they're in because i understand the condition i was previously in and i can imagine the condition i would be in without the grace of god and without the knowledge of his word so it lifts me up into a place where you're not arrogant you're not condescending not pointing an angry finger but actually have a love and say oh god they just don't know they just can't know they're just totally stuck in absolute darkness absolute blindness the god of this evil age is blind to their eyes oh god now there's a compassion that comes because i could see me there if it wasn't for god now that is in no ways excusing behavior it's wrong it's sinful it has to be judged and it will be judged so there's no way in which this love bypasses judgment there's no way in which it says you know god i don't want you to no any longer be just but it's saying oh god if you could open their eyes if they could see if they could repent if they just knew what i knew they wouldn't live like they lived if they just knew if they just had what you pushed in my heart in their heart they wouldn't do what they're doing see it's a whole different level of love hallelujah it's not the doting old grandfather kind of love but it's a it's a love of understanding it's a higher order let's look at romans 13 together romans chapter 13 we heard what jesus said and we'll pick up here what the apostle paul says romans 13 7. render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor owe no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shall not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shall not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law why because if you love your neighbors you loved yourself you wouldn't commit adultery with his wife you wouldn't steal from him you wouldn't kill him see it's all fulfilled in this love god with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength with all your might and love your neighbor as yourself and then god doesn't have to give you a bunch of rules that pure genuine love of god in your heart for those two things takes care of all of it because you wouldn't do your brother wrong with that kind of love you wouldn't do your neighbor wrong with that kind of love amen let's go to first john first john chapter 4. first john chapter 4 and verse 19 we love him because he first loved us so saying i love him is only a reflection of the revelation that he loved you first like the ability to love him is only because he had the ability to love you first so that's why when we come to true revelation on the word there is no room for pride and arrogance none whatsoever because true revelation will not bring that will not bring pride will not bring any arrogance because you realize my love to him is only in response to his love to me had he not first loved me i would have no capacity within myself to love him so my love for him and my ability to hear his word and my desire to live his word has nothing to do with me being a good person so i can get no credit for it therefore i can have no arrogance about it i i can't there's nothing that i can claim that i did myself because that arrogant powerful attitude comes with somebody who thinks that they've arrived because they're good or they made a good decision or i'm it wasn't a good choice i made when i decided to serve jesus you know you could never decide that you could never even choose that if he hadn't chose you first you can never have the love that you have for him if he hadn't loved you first we love him because he first loved us and we got to keep these things right in our mind amen we love him because he first loved us verse 20 if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he now now listen i we're gonna we're gonna look at this scripture but you can say i don't hate my brother hates a strong word i just don't like them [Applause] i i just i just don't i just i just don't like him [Music] but look at what he says next for he that loveth not his brother you're not allowed to land somewhere in between the scriptures placing us either one side or the other not giving us room to work in between love and hate verse 20 if a man say i love god and hated this brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen so he's not saying dislike dislikes not doesn't fit here because brother because let me finish verse 21 and then we'll make this comment in this commandment have we from him that he that he who loveth god loveth his brother also so god now is equating your love for your brother with your love for him so if i say i don't hate my brother but i dislike him how does that relate to god because where is god he abides in his people if that's your brother within him is an attribute of god a portion of god a peace of god and if i dislike that how do i feel towards god see it's john who's drawing the equal sign amen it's it's john who's saying and in this commandment have we from him that he he who loveth god love his brother also it's a commandment amen and if it's a commandment then that means if it's a commandment that god's given us and something that god told us to do then he must supply the capacity to do it because this this is not something that you can just do all by yourself it takes the very love of god in your heart to do these because some of us have been wronged in very serious ways some have been wronged in church settings and some have been wronged in family settings and we've gone through some wrong things and you can't say anything else but they're wrong it was wrong it wasn't right what happened somebody took advantage of me abused me manipulated me exposed me or talked evil of me whatever it was hey but don't forget the fact you've done some of those things too amen it's easy or you have sometimes people all they want to do is talk about the hurt all right i was hurt this way and i was hurt that way and i was hurt this way and you know what i want to say to them sometimes is okay we're going to talk about that won't you give equal time to the hurt you've caused if you enjoy talking about who hurt you so much give equal time to those those that you've heard and let's have an honest discussion because sometimes we use these things that i was hurt this way and i was hurt that way and it's we use it as justification to have resentment and bitterness and we wouldn't ever say that but that's exactly what's happening we're using it as a justification for our conduct we know i'm hurt and the reason i can't enter in and the reason i can't worship god and the reason i don't give him all is because i've been hurt and the reason i'm struggling is because i've been hurt my goodness you've never been hurt more than jesus christ was hurt you've never been hurt more than the apostle paul's been heard you've never been hurt more than the disciples were hurt in the first age amen there's there's a point that we've got to come to and we've got to grow up and say if anything ever happened to me god allowed it for my good and i'm not going to let the devil turn that into a pity party where i sit around and nurse a herd just to justify my lack of commitment to him why don't you go to church i've been hurt at churches [Music] the apostle paul was hurt in almost every church he went in but every time he went to the next city he went to the he went to church i mean he went to the synagogue one day and he starts preaching the message he's gone they take him out they stone him leaving for dead he gets up he goes to the next city and preaches the same sermon he just got stoned for why because he loved the brethren it would have been easy for the apostle paul amen you talk about wounds he had physical wounds not just emotional wounds he had him inside and outside scars both ways so it takes away the excuse to nurse a hurt and justification for living a halfway life i don't live a sanctified life i don't live a consecrated life i'm not fully obedient to the word and anytime you talk to somebody about well you know i've been hurt i don't doubt that and i don't doubt that the hurt was a real hurt and that it actually caused pain and that there was real suffering that went with that but let the suffering produce what it's supposed to produce it's not supposed to withdraw you from the body it's not supposed to pull you away from your passion and love for the word or your consecrated life to jesus christ that wasn't the purpose of that hurt because god allowed and if god allowed it it was to move you higher in the kingdom of god and plan of god not to push you down but we're letting the devil keep us down we've gotta we've got to have the right attitude about these things and if god told me to love my brother the same way that i love god then he's got to supply the capacity because in my human flesh i am void i find myself void of the ability i mean especially with somebody who's really done you wrong you find yourself on empty when it comes to trying to love that brother trying to love that sister trying to love that family member all of a sudden you find that i just don't have a capacity to do it but if it's in the word i can ask for it if it's there in the scripture and it's a commandment i can get down to pray but you know what i have to do when i get down to pray i've got to be real with god i've got to be genuine in my attempt i can't be half-hearted i can't give lip service to an idea but i've got to mean it from my heart and i got to say god i'm having trouble forgiving this brother i'm having trouble getting past this hurt but your word says that i've got to love them the same as i love you and i'm asking you now to heal this in my broken heart and give me the ability to love the way you love why because it's in the word and anything in the word you can ask for and you can have faith that he'll do it and sometimes the devil's tricked us into nursing a wound so long that we get so comfortable nursing the womb and we like the attention we get from others because others will show compassion because you're dealing with people who have love they'll show real compassion and real concern and sometimes we enjoy the compassion and concern so much that we're not willing to get over it because there's a fear on the inside of losing this contact with compassion and love humans are so weak the human mind and the human emotion drop is so weak we'll nurse a hurt just because when we talk about it somebody shows us love and compassion and feeling and we we want that so bad that we're willing to hold on to something to get the compassion and it's all human human love human compassion human hurt if we would just be willing to drop that thing and receive the love of god it would actually be the bomb and gilead that would heal our broken heart and deliver us even from the need for human compassion even from the need to somebody to pet me and stroke me and tell me it's going to be all right but i get to a place where i say it's not all right because you tell me it's all right it's all right because it's really all right and it's not all right for 10 minutes while you talk to me but tomorrow it hurts again no there's something that god has done that makes it all right today and all right tomorrow and all right the next day and a year from now it'll still be okay because there's a bomb in gilead there's a healing for the spirit realm when jesus came and they handed him the scroll and he opened it up and he began to read from the scroll he said he's here to bind up the brokenhearted part of jesus ministry is to bind up the brokenhearted and set at liberty those that are captive he wasn't talking about heart disease it wasn't hypertension he's talking about your broken heart your emotional realm he's here to bind up the brokenhearted quit going to people to try to get a fix for what he already said he's here to fix it's not wrong to talk to somebody but when we talk to somebody and talk to somebody and talk to somebody and talk to somebody and talk to somebody and years later nothing really has changed it's time to go talk to the one person who can bring a change god i need a permanent change in my heart because i find the way i am now i i have a hard time loving that but i have a hard time shaking their hand i have a hard time hugging their neck i have a hard time having i have a hard time wishing for their benefit and for blessings in their life sometimes we say we forgive somebody and we say you know everything's all right but every time something negative happens in their life you kind of have a little bit of yeah well they had it coming instead of a grieving oh god why is this hitting my brother why is this hitting my sister why is this hit their family oh god deliver them from that no there's a little bit of satisfaction in their suffering because they made you suffer and you're kind of happy that they're suffering and you would never take that and put that on we wouldn't put that on our lips but that's exactly what's happening down in the emotional realm of us weak needy broken failed human beings but god can god can do something different amen to where when we see somebody else suffer no matter how bad they made us suffer we can say oh god help my brother help my sister i i don't want them to hurt and i don't want them to have trouble i'm telling you we can get to that place why because it's in the word amen and this is the day for the fulfillment the full display of the full word do you believe that we're living in the hour the full display of the full word amen to actually be christ-like not as lip service but as an actual reality and if that's the hour we live in it that's what we believe this also must be on display go to galatians chapter 5. i've said before my favorite kind of preaching that i love more than anything is breaking down the message getting into the seals feast of trump is the timeline brother bennett's ministry i enjoy that so much i like hearing it preach i like preaching it i like talking about it but what good is it if we can't love the brethren you see what i mean those are my favorite subjects i can preach them all day long discuss them all day long but what good is it if it doesn't translate into a life [Music] galatians 5 13 for brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one another praise god that's the truth we're not to be biting at one another and i'm not just talking about just in our homes that's true in our church but i mean the bride universal not just in this church but the bride around the world there's no place for this biting because if we won't stand for who each other who else is going to stand for us we're coming to a place where nobody else in the world is going to stand we might as well stand for one another and learn to love one another no matter what even if we disagree this agreement's not a problem amen strife is a problem disagreement's not a problem you can disagree with no strife like brother branham said he goes i like cherry pie you like apple well that doesn't cause strife you don't get in a big knock down drag out fight and break fellowship because you disagree and then brother brahm's using such a light things as a thing but he's trying to show amen we should have that same attitude even if it's about doctrinal things even if it's about serious things things that are very deep in our heart and things that we believe to be essential and crucial to know in this day i can still disagree i should be able to i say this way disagree with the brother on that point and still be able to shake his hand and hug his neck and tell him i love him if not there's something wrong with me [Applause] and it better and it it should cause me to question my doctrine because if my doctrine can't produce that life but my doctrine produces strife and anger and animosity then something might be wrong with my doctrine they understand we've got to be real we've got to be genuine we've got this is going to be a real christianity this is not going to be a pretend kind of a thing [Applause] we can't pretend this if we've got feelings of ought towards this and feelings a lot toward that we've got to get to the altar somewhere and we've got to pray and say god you've got to change me [Applause] you've got to change me lord praise god it's the truth these things are going to go i mean they're going to go it's going to go away in the bride these things are going to vanish how can you say that chad because it's in the word and she's going to be a word bride fully living the word these things are going to go away and if we know they're going to go away and we can see it in the word let's start getting in the rhythm of the word let's start getting in the beat amen there's a changing in the beat amen now we see it building and we see it coming let's get into the rhythm of it and say god i need this greater manifestation god i need you to purify my heart god i need you to heal me i need you to give me the right response i need you to take this out of me i need you to put this into me if it's in the word we can ask for it let's go to first corinthians chapter 5 verse 4. and when i when i preach this it's a taking home kind of a thing this is no pitchfork message because where everyone guilty of this because we're in human flesh and we're so susceptible to this where everyone guilty of it and we everyone need to take heart and hear this and apply it first corinthians 5 and 4. in the name of our lord jesus christ when you are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ to deliver such a one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus for your glory is not good know you not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump so we know that this is a case of fornication in the church and they've let it go he says you let it go because of your pride and the apostle paul is telling them how to judge this matter that they should judge it that they should deal with it that they should bring a correction and that they should disfellowship the brother what is this the love of god this is the love of god but let's turn to second corinthians chapter two second corinthians chapter 2 verse 5. he's referring to the same case but if any have caused grief he has not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many so that contrary-wise you ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with over much sorrow wherefore i beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things they were obedient in judgment where we're going to be obedient in restoration i want to see if you'll be obedient in all things and he's saying restore such a one so that they're not overcome with grief restore such a one and restore him quickly this is what paul is writing so the apostle paul now he tells you this is not according to the word this is not right it has to be dealt with it has to be judged and you have to put him out from among you deliver him to the destruction unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the soul might be saved what is that that's the love of god but when the man repented now he says restore your love to them confirm your love to him forgive him and restore him what is that the love of god express to the brethren that's why tithe is the love of god and the love of the brethren it's the same love amen for the same entity but this is the first commandment love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and the second is like it love thy neighbor as thyself amen sometimes we have individuals and those of us those of us tend to lean one way or the other we have all kinds of personality types here and we go one way some of us are really good at calling out the wrong and standing for the word there's nothing wrong with that right we must take a stand for the word if it's wrong it's wrong if it must be dealt with it must be dealt with if it needs judged it needs judge we are supposed to stand on the word that's our love for god and his word we love god's word more than our relationship with another person that we will stand on the word and i will i will stand with god on the word more than i try to preserve a human relationship that's the love of god some of us are good at that others of us are really good at the reconciling and forgiving part you know they didn't mean to and if you knew the circumstances that they were in and you knew all of that that's also the love of god but you can take either side to error if we're always passing somebody over they do wrong you have but you know their family situation yeah but you know do you know but you know but you know all of a sudden you put that relationship with that person and your human love for that person above the word of god and that is wrong but also to take a stance on the word of god with not fulfilling the word of god and loving a brother is also not right but i say god matures till we can come right in the middle to where i can stand on the word regardless of anything else and wrong is wrong and right is right and we can judge wrong and right but that i can stand with my brother as an advocate just as soon as we've made the judgment that i can go right to the altar and say god now forgive my brother now help them let them be reconciled god you know they didn't mean to do it god you know their family god you [Music] put me right in the middle god put me right in the place where you are because this is how jesus christ acted amen he could look at the pharisees and call him whited sepulchers and he could hang on the cross and say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and if the bride of jesus christ is going to live the life of jesus christ she's going to be right in between these she will be able to judge by the word and she will not let down on the word for nobody but she will never abandon a brother in need she will never forsake a brother who needs reconciled and needs love what a place to be and what a high calling the apostle paul is showing judge smite reconcile and restore that's all the love of god look through the old testament how many times does he judge and smite then restore and reconcile over and over and over again this is what god does for his children they get wrong he brings the judgment he chastises him uses the rod of man or the rod of famine or plague chastises them then he comes right along and he heals their land and he heals them and he restores them and brings a prophet to them and brings the word back and that cycle repeats and repeats and repeats both sides are the love of god let's go to galatians chapter 6. in verse 1. galatians 6 and 1. brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one another's burns and so fulfill the law of christ you know there's a time when your judgment is correct what that brother did is wrong that's wrong and you're absolutely right and sometimes you're not wrong if you need to go and tell them but you know you don't always need to be the one that goes and tells them only if the situation involves you only if god's led you to only if you're the one who needs to say it but you know that that brother is wrong my question is knowing that he's wrong wrong by the word that should put us as an advocate to the father because he's wrong but i've been wrong like he ought to know better but i ought to know better that's what he says considering thine own self right this is the way to advocate it says if any man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest they'll also be tempted so if i look at the situation with compassion brother brahma said don't judge him until you've walked a mile in his shoes and if we really get over the offense sometimes we just need to get over the offense and just see it the way god sees it i mean have you been more offended than god sometimes we just need to get over the offense and really look at what's going on in my brother's life and why and then consider ourselves and say you know what if i've been where he'd been and done what he's done had done to me what's been done then i'm i could see myself doing the same thing he's doing it and then i quit standing up here pointing at my brother you need to get this right you need to make this right you need to do this right well you know what you can say that's wrong when you shouldn't have done that that's the truth but then you can come down and you can put your arm around your brother and say lord i'm on my brother's side i'm on his team and i'm asking you to forgive him and i'm asking you to heal him with the hurts that led him to this and i'm asking you to change the situations that caused him to do this and i want you to know i'm on his side guess what you're not going to lose your sonship over that you're not saying he's right you're saying he's wrong you're not giving a pass for misconduct you're just saying god i want you to open his eyes and i want you to forgive him and i want you to do this or that you know the prophets would pray amen there would be intercession all the time and if god still needed to judge he would still judge even though they were praying but they were still interceding and i'd rather be interceding playing the part of christ and let god do whatever he's got to do rather than trying to condemn this brother and ask god to pass extra judgment because what if somebody did that for you and your mistake god's going to judge god's going to chastise josh is going to correct i don't have to worry about that it's sure but i can sure get down next to my brother and say god i'm on his side and i'm asking you to forgive him and open his eyes and bring a change to this situation somebody's got to intercede somebody's got to stand in the gap somebody's got to be an advocate we can't just kick people out and you know come back when you deal with your issue there's got to be some real maturity coming to the bride it's such a fine line because you can never condone the actions and you can never say well it's all right no it's wrong and you have to fix it and you have to make it right and this will never be acceptable but i'm going to pray for you and i'm going to stand in the gap for you and pray that god gives you the capacity to repent and that god will open your eyes so you'll see it's different let's go to the book of exodus exodus 32. exodus 32 and i'm going to begin reading at 17. moses was up on the mountain receiving the ten commandments and these first two tables of stone were written on front and back and these were two stones that god had made himself and written with his own finger and these were precious and he gave him his word and then he told moses get down the people of sin and i'm going to get rid of him and moses stood in the gap and said god don't do it what will the enemy say don't do it lord so now he's coming down in this part of the story he's coming down off the mountain and they begin to hear the noise in the camp verse 17 and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp he said is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear and i come to pat and it came to pass as soon as he come nigh into the cam that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger was waxed hot and he cast the tables of out of his hands and break them beneath the mount and he took the calf which he had made and burn it in the fire and ground it into powder and straw it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it and moses said unto aaron what did this people and today that thou has brought so great a sin upon them let's move down to verse 26 and moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man and sword by his side and go in and out from the gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man's companion every man his neighbor and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and their fellow the people that day about three thousand men for moses said it from for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day it came to pass on tomorrow that moses said unto the people you have sinned a great sin and now i will go up into the lord per adventure i shall make an atonement for your sin and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and i have made and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou has written the lord said to moses whoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book we look at this and the reason i read this is because i want to show two sides to the ministry of moses when moses come down off the mountain saw what had happened in his anger he passed a judgment and his judgment was a righteous judgment moses threw down the tables of stone took the golden calf burn it grounded the powder threw it on the water and made them drink it then he called for whoever's on the lord's side and the levites gathered together took their sword and went and killed three thousand of their brethren that was the judgment of god and moses was there executing the judgment of god amen he was representing god but the next day after he says this is wrong you've done wrong you drink this you die the next day he goes to the mountain to make an atonement for their sins and he throws himself in the gap and said god and save the forgive their sin and if not blot my name out of the book he's willing friends this is this is serious he's not just saying god forgive them horrible people they should have never done that he's throwing himself in the mix he's putting himself with his brethren and he's saying if you're gonna don't forgive them blot me out lord don't don't take them unless you take me and basically saying over my dead body in a way he said god don't do it to him don't do it to him if you can't forgive them blot my name out and god says i'll blot who i'll block i'm not blotting yours just because you asked me to but there was nothing wrong with moses request brother branham said that always puzzle me i'm moses could have a different idea and he said i saw it was the it was the spirit of christ in moses that was interceding you see there's two sides to the nature of god there's judgment and mercy moses there he shows both sides judgment which was right on in line spot on with what should have happened but he doesn't keep judging and keep judging and keep judging and keep condemning and keep talking about how bad they were the very next day after judgment was met he goes to the mountain to make an atonement and throws himself before god and stands in front of the people and says if forgive their sin if not blot my name out and he's shielding the people from god an atonement means a covering he said i'm gonna go see if i can make a covering for your sins and moses was wanting to become the covering can't we do the same thing can't we say god this is my brother you know you realize we can no longer take the attitude if you believe you won't believe what i want you do your thing onto our thing just leave me alone my body's not changing until his changes you know it doesn't matter i can't just say well you can do what you want i'll go do what i want we'll just go separate ways and not not fellowship with each other never not even like each other and everything will be fine if he's part of the body and i'm part of the body that ain't going to work because i'm not getting a change till he gets a change and my atoms and his atoms will change at the same time and i need him just as much as he needs me you see these divisions aren't going to work it doesn't work in the body of christ we've got to have the right attitude towards stuff you can't force anything like you can't force a reconciliation you can't force a harmony you can't force a unity but you sure don't have to work against it and you can certainly pray for it like we don't we don't have to you you can't force anybody to change their idea you can't force anybody to do anything but my when we recognize that this isn't going to work we can get down in an earnest prayer and say god something has to change here you've got to do something we've got to we've got to have the enemy withdrawn from our camp so that we can fellowship and love one another as brothers not force an agreement that's ecumenicism or say we disagree with that but we'll still have no i if i disagree i'll tell you i disagree and there's things i can't go along with there's certain things i can't go along with i'll tell you i can't go along with it but i still love you you're my brother and i expect to see you in the millennium you see it's the attitude you can't force it neither should you drop the word amen in order to have the fellowship no sir but you've got to have the right attitude about it how much has god revealed to us in the last few years changing our paradigm lifting us higher uh higher and higher and higher and now's not the time amen to draw lines and separate it over that because the next move higher might move us right into a different understanding than where we are now and if we go ahead and determine this is in and this is out and this is right and this is wrong when god's not finished growing up the bride yet then we're gonna we're gonna force ourselves into a position that becomes uncomfortable as revelation comes it's better just to say i love my brothers god's working it all out amen we're all gonna wind up in the same place at the same time i don't know how to work i'm not changing my convictions and i'm not compromising on my convictions but i'm not ruling anybody in around and i'm not calling you anything but my brother you see it's the right attitude the attitude matters so much to god brother beam said god will let something happen just to see what you'll do about it he'll let something negative something terrible just to see what you'll do about it can you take the nature of jesus christ in that situation are we going to go back to a human nature praise god let's look at psalms 106. psalms 106. verse 23 psalms 106 23 therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath unless teachers should destroy them this was up on the mount the first time when he said the people have sinned and i wiped them off and started with you and moses threw himself down and said don't do it but listen he said he would destroy them had not moses has chosen stood before him in the breach god needed moses god needed moses to stand in the breach he had to have moses stand in the breach because god had to pull this this nation out according to his word he had to deliver them and take him to the promised land to keep his word he had to have a moses who would take the spirit of christ upon himself and stand in the gap for the people and stand in the breach what was it it was god and judgment and it was god and intercession it was god bringing judgment and it was god and moses standing in the place of intercession standing in the breach because god is playing out this drama he's got to be the righteous judge and he's got to be able to show mercy because somebody stands in the gap he would have destroyed them had not moses stood in the breach do you think god might still need somebody to stand in the breach do you realize the bride is standing in the breach for the whole world if the bride was gone this whole world would enter into a cycle of destruction that will bring it uttered ruin and destruction to bring about the millennium what's holding it back the presence of the bride right now the bride is standing in the breach judgment cycle started amen christ has been rejected the indictment has been given the trial has been preached amen there's nothing to hold back the judgment we see it cycling but it can't unlock in full fury until the bride is gone amen you're here standing in the gap amen so that there's still an opportunity for somebody to be saved and if we can do that for the entire planet what about for our brothers and sisters what about for that one who's done something wrong and it's really wrong can we not advocate with them for the father you know if we if we if we've failed if we've done something wrong we have an advocate for with the father which is jesus christ what is an advocate one who's called alongside to stand next to you hallelujah can we do that for our brothers and sisters can we come alongside and pray and stand next to and say god i'm not against him i'm on the same team thereon and i'm asking you forgive us can you say it that way can you say not god for can you say god now that i'm standing i've joined myself to this brother in prayer can you forgive us can you turn our hearts can you open our eyes i'm telling you that's the kind of prayer that's going to get somewhere with god and maybe some of the problems we see in contention and strife is because there's not enough people standing in the gap maybe he's waiting for the christ in the bride to stand in the gap for brothers and sisters to bring reconciliation to stop just judgment criticizing hey saying something's wrong is fine it's wrong say it's wrong but can we take the other side too can we stay in the righteous judgment and have the spirit of christ an intercession if we stay on one side of the other we're wrong but christ was in the middle brother in preaching standing in the gap he talked about he had done what moses did when moses was rejected back in egypt and he ran out into the wilderness he he was rejected so he went out there to nurses hurt he thought his people he thought they should have received him as a deliverer so he went out there for 40 years he nursed his hurt until when god finally come down and says you are the deliverer and you're the one to go he didn't want to go you think about this he raises up to he's 40 years old and he's mighty in word and indeed that's what the scripture says he was a mighty man he goes to deliver them because he knows that's his role and they reject him as a deliverer so he he's ready to step into the role he's ready to deliver his brother he's got compassion on them he's ready to do all but they reject him so he runs out and he nurses his hurt so long that when god comes down in a mighty manifestation as a pillar of fire and speaks to him audibly and god says now you're the one to go down he says i don't want to go i can't do it i'm not able moses didn't want to go he had long forgot his suffering brethren he had lost the love and compassion for his brethren brahm comes along and he says this brother was typing it with himself they rejected his message and he got hurt and he started nursing his hurt and he wanted to run to the wilderness to become a guide to trap his wife into a lifestyle she didn't want i mean he's willing look what he's willing to do because what's he going to do go nurse his hurt i'm so glad we had an honest prophet that could tell the truth it helps me so much but god spoke to him said if you do that your wife will leave you you'll be a bum why because that's not what he was called to do the brother man says it this way and standing in the gap in this message where he explains all this he said surely if this in itself is a tremendous thing that will bring to pass and make come to pass a tremendous victory in the love divine he's talking about danny henry when he ran up to him at a at a businessman's meeting i believe it was and he wrapped his arms around him and spoke in french and prophesied and become an interpreter three interpreters come and interpret it and brother branham had just read that before we get in this part of standing in the gap and it says you've chosen the narrow way the harder way you did it of your own choosing this is my way this is the precise way this is my way he gets down there he says this in itself will bring to pass the great to tremendous victory and the love divine your choice will bring to past the great victory in divine love so he's referring to that he says it'll make come to pass a tremendous victory in the love divine and that's the verb before the adverb then it's divine love which is god divine love is god the capstone is god and it takes the love of god to dash out there on the front line and stand in the gap for the people why because you get rejected you get criticized you get misjudged and misrepresented that's what brother bannon is looking at that's why it takes the love of god you can't do this by yourself if you're going to stand in the gap for your brother and if you're going to proclaim the truth amen and stand in the gap you're you're going to be rejected you're going to be criticized your motives will be challenged amen everything about what you do will be challenged will be put in question but it takes the love of god to run out on the front lines and stand in the gap for god's people and are we going to sit in a foxhole and nurse our wounds are we going to dash out to the front line because there's a tremendous victory coming in divine love and can i have the love of god enough amen to still stand for the truth and speak the truth and stand in the gap and love my brother regardless of the criticism regardless of the misjudgment regardless of the hurtful statements and not be hurt back at them and not become offended and break off fellowship no stand on the front line and let what come come but have a higher love that says god they just don't understand it's not it's brother branham was preaching one time and he says he's praying and the prayer he says oh and they hate us then he corrects himself he says it's not us they hate lord it's you that they hate it's your word are we so confident of the word of god that we can say it's not me i'm not going to take offense because it's not me if it's your word it's your word but god i'm praying that you open the eyes of my brother i'm praying that you open all of our eyes we haven't all arrived i'm praying god that you help me see help me see my failures i can see my brothers help me see mine can we stand alongside and advocate and say lord my brother said this and it did this and i'm asking you to forgive him for my sake can you do that who is better to stand in the gap than the one that's been the most offended say god do this for my sake and help us lord to have a better understanding help me to have a better understanding because guess what we've not arrived our course is not finished we've not finished our race and we can always stand alongside and say god us help us bring us higher help us see more clearly i've said this many times before if you have a standoff and you have a doctrinal standoff two good brothers love the lord love one another and they just can't seem to mesh the odds are they're both not seeing it as they should that's the odd the odds are neither he nor he or she nor she is seeing it exactly like you should when both of us see it exactly like god sees it there'll be no contention so don't get so dogmatic and say this is it and against this hey maybe you don't see it like you should yet maybe we don't see it exactly like we should maybe we don't see it exactly like we ought to because we know nothing as we ought to know it take heed and now think as thou stand lest thou fall because we don't none of us see it as we ought to because after we all see it as we ought to my atoms are going to change so if i realize there's some things i still see it not i don't see as i ought to then how can i condemn my brother because he can't see what i see maybe i don't see it like i ought to when i see it like i ought to what he's saying and what i'm saying will fit right together like that [Applause] there's no reason to fight god can defend his own word he doesn't need me to do it i don't need to defend his word and i don't need to declare what's exactly right exactly wrong i just take what he shows me and i believe it and i stand on it and i preach it and when you share it and you believe it amen don't change what you believe stand on it believe it it's your conviction it's your revelation but just remember in a point of contention or questioning maybe we don't see it as we ought to yet maybe there's more to see that'll bring a greater clarity that'll bring a greater harmony why it's the attitude it's the attitude that matters you want to have the right attitude let's look at matthew 23. matthew 23 and verse 23 woe unto you scribes pharisees hypocrites if you pay tithe of minton anderson come and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy faith these ought you to have done and not to leave the other undone you blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion in the excess thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are alike unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity can jesus lay down a judgment can jesus tell the truth let's turn over to luke 23 luke 23 and i want to look at verse 32. this is jesus being crucified so there were also two other male factors led with him to be put to death when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the male factor is one on the right hand and the other on the left then jesus said then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god jesus is nailed to the cross after gone through some of the most horrendous torture and most offensive things that can happen to a human being mocked and ridiculed made fun of falsely accused beaten stripped naked nailed to a cross you have never been that offended in your life i can safely say you you and i have never been that offended in our lives and he's looking out at the very people who were crying crucify him crucify him and the rulers were with the people because the next verse says that the rulers were with the people and he still says father forgive them they don't know what they're doing what kind of love is this agape love capstone love the love of understanding of intelligence of reason and decision where he's flying higher than everybody else in the crowd and he understands the word that's being fulfilled he understands the necessity for a judas a necessity for those who would cry out for his blood a necessity for romans who would nail him to the cross he could see that this is the plan of god and necessary for the furthering of the kingdom of god and he could look and say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing oh can we do the same thing with revelation can we look at those around us amen who criticize what we do or chastise us or are misjudged and can say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and half the time i don't know what i'm doing forgive us father forgive us bring us into a better spot bring us into a better condition can we take that approach can we have the very life of jesus christ living on the inside and we realize god needed moses to stand in the gap so the scripture says psalms 106. he would have destroyed them had not moses but jesus is here and there's priests there there's people there they've called for his blood they've conspired against him they've been angry at him he said father forgive them my question to you is what would have happened to that generation had he not said that you know power of life and death is in the tongue and the son of god is an attribute of god is an expression of god it matters what we say he was there talking to the disciples and he looked out among the people and had compassion for them he said pray to the lord of the harvest that will send laborers into the harvest brother brahm takes his whole story and he says he was the lord of the harvest he's the one who told him they need why did they have to pray he said because god has so fixed this program he cannot do anything without you and i and we need to ask if we need to ask for laborers how about asking for forgiveness for a brother how about asking god to open his eyes how about asking god to change the circumstances how about asking god to reconcile this situation how about using our the power of life and death and our sonship and use it for things that christ was doing amen remember when elisha and the she bears i mean when he was offended amen he had the power because of his position to call for she bears and they came and they killed it really happened because of his position because brother branham said that wasn't the spirit of christ it wasn't the spirit of christ but god honored his position and because of his position he honored his word so when he brought brings brother branham to the same position amen there's a couple being a distraction making love on the front seat amen and and brother brennan was already told there's going to be a trap for you his test is coming and he comes down and he sees the people in the front row and they're a distraction and he asks them to stop and they won't stop and he says they're in your hands whatever you this is the test said i forgive you do you realize if he hadn't forgave them god wouldn't have forgave them if he would have said you're dead what would have happened to those people in the front row they would have died but there was a prophet of god showing us what it's like to be under control and have the spirit of christ and he says i forgive you why can't we catch that friends why is it we always wanted we're wrong don't want something wrong to happen to you there's got to be a meat judgment and why can't we just forget all of the judgments say god don't judge them on my behalf because i want them to go free i want them to be forgiven i want them to go free you're sovereign you do what you have to do but not for me don't do it for me don't judge them on my account don't judge them for my benefit don't judge them because it's my desire my desires they go scot-free why why can you say that brother tell me they do such wrong because i've done wrong and i've got the capacity to do wrong again and i want somebody who've i've wronged to say the same thing about me because if they're a son of god their words carry weight with god and i want them to say god let brother chad go let him go free let my brother go free he's offended me but let him go free and i'll do the same for you and you do the same for me and let's use our sonship to build the body of christ not tear it down it matters what we say jesus said forgive them elijah's wrong attitude still brought a result and brother branham's right attitude brought a result don't think you can say and do things wrong and god will just smudge it over no you're a son or daughter of god with the power of life and death in your tongue you you think wrong and speak wrong you're going to get wrong and you're wrong might hurt somebody else terribly bad we can all say amen because we're every single one of us guilty but that in the past is not going to work in the future he's got to get to the bride to the same spot where they can do like brother branham sing wrong i told you don't do it i asked you not to do it you did it anyways it's an offense to me it's hurtful to the people but i forgive you anyways because if i was in your place i'd want you to forgive me praise be to god something's got to change and it's going to change the bride is going to climb higher still too much self self preservation self love still too much self let's go to acts chapter 7. act chapter 7 verse 51 they take stephen deacon in the church who is doing many signs and wonders marvelous works contesting with them they could not they could not overthrow his wisdom so they conspired against him and arrested him brings him in for questioning and he preaches a sermon on the whole bible i think the word was open to him he was reading from the open book he preached the whole sermon and he comes down to the end and this is what he says here at the end verse 51 you stiff-necked and uncircumcised and hardened ears you do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do you which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one and you have been now the betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth now think about this he just preached to them a whole sermon about the bible bringing them right up to date and he says you stiff-necked and uncircumcised you do always resist the holy ghost as your father's dead your your father's in the they killed the prophets you're doing the same thing i mean i would say he passed an accurate judgment and he pulled no punches and he told the truth would you agree that was straight up there's some people that have been sitting there that day with the attitude get him get him get him get him get him get him get him he had to say what he had to say but what he says next is probably the most important statement that he makes look at what he says next when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed them with their teeth but he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and he said behold i see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of god what a revelation what an experience what a spiritual experience what does this revelation and spiritual experience produce then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's speed whose name was saul who would become the apostle paul and they stoned stephen calling upon god and laying and saying lord receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep this tremendous revelation of the open work where he can preach to them a sermon compact into a sermon their journey through the entire bible and then he can accurately judge their current spiritual condition and infuriate them to the point they want to kill him but at that point god opens his eyes gives him a revelation and he can see heavens open and the sun sitting on the right hand of the father what a tremendous revelation it didn't make him arrogant didn't puff him up and didn't give him the ability to escape persecution they took him out and began to stone him he's calling upon the name of the lord saying lord receive my spirit as they're stoning him he's kneeling down drop to his knees and listen to what he says and cried with a loud voice lay not the sin to their charge you realize he didn't have to cry with a loud voice for god to hear him who did stephen want to hear this he didn't need to scream for god to hear he said it to god for the benefit of those who would hear it and those were the people who were stoning him who was there that day the apostle paul when he was still saul unconverted remember the sons of god are part of god and what they say matters and when he says god lay not this sin to their charge we know at least one man there that day needed to be released from guilt there was at least one that had to be he had to forgive that one and remove guilt and ask god please god please god you did i don't know that stephen knew who was there but he knew there might be one there that's the son of god and for the sake of one i'll say god forgive them all forgive do what they've done to me is wrong this is not right i've not done anything wrong but don't charge them for this said god i let them go free don't judge them on my account because there was one there that was going to meet a pillar of fire and become the apostle to the eighth amen good prophet to the age and he needed stephen to release him from guilt [Applause] said paul consented to stephen's death and when brother brahma said what paul saw the way that stephen died amen it had affected him and it bothered him all the way through and the way he saw stephen died led to his conversion amen and after that it gave him the desire to die a martyr because of what he saw in stephen's death praise god amen stephen with a loud voice why because somebody's got to know that i forgive them amen they need to hear it i release them god lay not the sin to their charge hallelujah what do we do what power do we hold in our hands with unforgiveness what do we stop up in the kingdom of god what do we slow down what do we prevent by having the wrong attitude with unforgiveness and not releasing our brothers and sisters who've hurt us [Applause] amen we want to get out of here we want to see the full word on full display we want to see everything that he said happen we want to see every manifestation he said to be there we want the whole word on whole display and we want to move to the marriage supper and back here to millennium amen and that's not going to happen if we're stopping up the works with unforgiveness and wrong attitude but we've got to advocate for one another i've wronged some of you before unintentionally even you've wronged me unintentionally but i'm saying i forgive you will you forgive me can we come together and say lord forgive him this one did this lord forgive him for my sake this one did this forgive him for my sake this one did this forgive him for my sake can we come to that place where we genuinely forgive and if we're struggling with that can we say god i'm desperately in need of something from you because from my heart i'm not able to let this go but this isn't right i'm wrong had people tell me before i just can't get over it no you can't by yourself but don't stay in that condition don't be happy about that condition if i got to the place where something was eating me up with bitterness and i just couldn't get over it i'd be fasting and praying and asking god to remove that thing from me god take it right out of my heart lord it's hindering your whole program it's affecting somebody else it's affecting us we've got to take a different approach matthew chapter 5. matthew chapter 5 verse 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad he just took away your excuse to be upset want to read that again if you've ever felt persecuted by family persecuted by other people in the church persecuted by those outside work co-workers if you've ever felt persecuted and got hurt over that you took the wrong response because he said you're supposed to rejoice read verse 11 blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you hallelujah if you've been rejected for what you believe if you've been persecuted for if you've been misunderstood and mocked and laughed at hallelujah your reward is great in heaven if it came from a close friend if it came from a family member if it came from somebody in church praise be to god this is what the disciples did when they were beaten and released they went back to the company and they began to rejoice that they were able to suffer for his namesake they did exactly what he told them to do they had a rejoicing testifying meeting and they were singing and praising god because they were found worthy amen to suffer for his namesake not time to sit back and nurse with how could they say that and they did no right to do that it was even against the law what they did to me what gave the disciples such power to overcome because they recognized this amen for the glory that lay ahead he endured the cross despising the shame we got to set our eyes above this carnal world above the carnal things and look at what's coming down the road hey you know friends there's a millennium coming where jesus christ will rule with a rod of iron where there will be absolute peace upon the earth for a thousand years and you get to rule in that government everything you love will be there amen everything you love about creation will be there everything you love about god's world will be there sometimes we just got to look a little further than what's happening here and rejoice let's go to ephesians chapter four sometimes what we need is not a change in our circumstances what we need is an adjustment in our attitude but we're always looking for the change in our circumstances to adjust our attitude well when this changes then i'll be happy when i don't have to deal with this no more then i'll be free no god's looking for you to be happy now to rejoice now to celebrate his word now ephesians 4 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that kind of kills criticism kills criticism of brothers and sisters let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers verse 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you forgive one another as god for christ's sake has forgiven you god for christ's sake because christ asked him to forgive us because he's the advocate with the father because he's in the place of intercession he's the one who said father forgive them so he forgave you for christ's sake he said you ought to forgive one another the same way can i come alongside my brother and i said god forgive them for me can you do that can we get to the place we say father forgive them for my sake i was the one who was offended forgive them for my sake i'm the one who's hurt but i'm not hurt no more you heal me forgive them from my sin amen praise me they're gone brother branham and shalom we we went over this this past wednesday but i like this quote and pulled it out so remember see i have watched when i seen them people just completely arrogantly walking away i think i've tried to express it this morning it's gross darkness upon them see brother branham is understanding why he's not just looking at the offense of them leaving him and rejecting him and leaving the word but he's looking at the reason why gross darkness upon them they can't help it i forgive them see for not listening and seeing the thing that god has done still they don't do it i still pray god forgive them and i mean it from my heart i don't say because my master said it but i want to feel it in my heart first that i really do i don't isolate myself from people i don't want to do that because i have a message for them salvation i have to go out among them we can pull up and pull away from church and pull away from work and pull away from talking to anybody out there because we've been so rejected but we've got a message of salvation and the devil wants us with hurts to pull back and shut down and well i'm not going to tell anybody else about every time i do i get my fingers smacked well get your finger smacked again and rejoice greatly because you have a reward in heaven every time you get wrapped on the knuckles say praise god another reward in heaven you have to have the right approach the right attitude the scriptural approach scriptural attitude and what i love is when he says they can't help it see the revelation where revelation brought brother branham he saw it was denominational darkness on his brothers out there in the full gospel businessmen association they were rejecting him and he could say it's the gross darkness that's upon the whole earth they can't help it i forgive them sometimes you see somebody that they just they're always irritating everybody around them they have an irritating spirit and attitude and they're constantly causing problems saying something hateful saying something this and saying something that but if you only knew why why nobody wakes up in the morning says i want to be crabby and indifferent and make everybody hate me today there's a reason why nobody wakes up in the morning and says i'm going to stick it with a sarcastic comment to everybody who talks to me nobody wakes up and wants to be that way why something has happened something has wounded hurt done something to hurt them you know what they need they need an advocate they need somebody to intercede on their behalf they need somebody to stand along beside and say god i know my brother don't want to be like that i know my sister don't mean those hurtful things god would you help her i don't know why lord i don't understand why she's hurting i don't understand why he's like that but would you lord for my sake would you help them open their eyes put a love in my heart for them can we pray that way i think if we start praying that way we're going to see some things change i think if we really really really take god at his word we're going to see some things begin to move brother brother says i have to mean it from my heart i don't say it just because the bible says it i don't say it just because brother chad said it sunday it's got to be a reality we're not looking for any more put on fake religion you know incantations words that don't mean anything we're looking for the reality to hit home the reality to hit my heart lord help me from my heart forgive my brother and god there's something plugging me up lord wash me out pour your oil in me do something in me to help me love that brother as myself in the token brother bam said oh take this solemnly we should love one another oh my we should be so in love don't never speak evil against one another if somebody makes a mistake pray for him right quick we are together in this with god god's in this too why you say you're waiting for the resurrection he said the resurrection is waiting on you god can do nothing without man god you and me and god are in this together we've got to get this right friends we are together in this with god we are brothers and sisters oh live godly live like daughters of god live like sons of god live sweet kind humble let no evil come in your mind and your thinking just dismiss it if it knocks on the door take it away just say just show your token just keep walking i'm under the blood so in that negative thought you've got to dismiss that negative thought about a brother or sister we've got to purge it out and just love one another i tell you god's going to test us god especially now that i preached it i'm sorry i just want to say right now i'm sorry god put it on my heart i have a responsibility preached he tells me but i'm sorry you will find that you will be tested in this probably this week but god wants to reinforce the lesson god wants us to know what we're supposed to do i just want to take a minute and talk about an issue we've got because we've got a lot of people shifting between churches in the area right now but if we don't take the right attitude towards it we're going to be really wrong with god and he will chastise us you know it's always hurtful when somebody leaves one assembly and goes to another it's always hurtful it's always difficult it's difficult for the people who are leaving it's difficult for the assembly it's difficult for everybody but we've got to let god move his children wherever he wants to we got to let god be in charge and we got to realize we've got to take the right attitude towards this because these aren't our favorite bald teams this isn't ohio state versus michigan this isn't a political move democrats and republicans we got to be really careful about our attitude somebody coming to the church doesn't equal success and somebody leaving doesn't equal failure [Applause] we've got to change our attitude let the children of god be led by the spirit of god and be happy for that whatever god has to do god has to do but there's a there's a human nature that wants to say if they leave amen it's because we're wrong but we're not wrong we're right so i got to prove her right you don't have anything to prove god has a sheep and god knows where he wants his sheep amen it's one army we're all on the same side but one may get moved from this platoon to that platoon it's the same army fighting the same battle against the same enemy for the same standards for the same word so don't take a wrong attitude that's going to bring judgment that's going to stop the blessings of god let's keep the right attitude let god be god and let god sort everything out and if somebody if god's going to move somebody say god bless them help them amen maybe there's something in their diet that they need for a particular time that they'll get somewhere else let god feed a sheep let god be the great shepherd but don't criticize and condemn you don't ever have to pull somebody down to make yourself go higher that's a sign of insecurity and don't ever pull somebody down to your level so you feel okay living at your level we see somebody living at a higher level higher level revelation higher standard all we want to do is pull them down so that we can be okay and not be challenged to rise higher don't do that and don't push somebody down so that you feel like you're higher you're not higher let god do what god wants to do and just be happy you know i've heard statements statements have come back to me that people have stayed you know when somebody's going to leave they tried to show the fault in another church where they're going that's a horrible way to get somebody to stay if the words that being preached is not meeting the need then you're criticizing another assembly is the wrong motivation to get somebody to stay it'll never work don't ever ever ever ever speak critically never don't ever be judgmental don't ever be critical you just be loving and be sweet and be kind because if god is put on somebody's heart to move there's a reason and if that's what god told them to do that's what we want them to do and if god has told somebody to come it's the same way we understand amen but to say no don't go there do you know this this and this what in the world how so you're going to get somebody to stay because they're afraid of where god's led them to go you're creating fear to hold somebody don't ever do that never never never do that the only reason somebody should stay is because god told them to stay and this is the place where god's feeding them if god wants to feed them somebody else let them go be fed somewhere else it's the word that holds the people not because well no they're wrong they're wrong they're wrong they're wrong they're wrong we're the only ones right so stay here i want nobody to stay here for that reason i can tell you right now if that's your motivation that's the wrong motivation you got to be planted where god wants you planted to feed from where god wants you to feed in the pasture where god wants you to eat and if god ever decides to move you then move follow the leading of the lord don't start that critical negative how how how can you vote for a democrat you know why i say that because it shows it's political in nature this side versus that side this idea versus that idea it's political and politics has nothing to do with the christian church we've got to be real these are real things this is where we live we've got to be real about it and take a real approach we can act like it's not happening but it's happening so let's just be real about it and let's be christians about it and let's have brotherly love that's i mean not even capstone just brotherly kindness that's not even to the capstone yet right yes and if you hear you know they said this and this one over there said this just say ah they didn't mean it that way can you do that you say that's my brother and you must have misunderstood they didn't mean it that way why can't we just believe for the positive instead of always jumping to the negative conclusion why can't we just assume something's out of context you'd be so much happier somebody tells you something say oh he didn't mean it that way and then you're happy you can go on and be happy i like being happy who doesn't want to be happy just be happy hey man don't get don't let your blood pressure go up one drop because somebody went or somebody came or somebody said made a statement don't let it change you a drop you stay tied into where christ is where god's led you where you know you belong you stay tied in and let god keep lifting you higher we need to have a mature approach mother brandon said in questions and answers 1964. august 23rd so now also here i want to bring this out i don't think my brother's here tonight but somebody made fun of somebody leaving the tabernacle and went down to brother junior jackson's for a church so they went down amongst the dead birds aren't you ashamed to make a remark like that this is somebody who left brother branham's church and left brother branham's church what would you think if you were there and they left brother branham's church and you knew he was the prophet of the age to go somewhere else i mean you you can't blame him for having a thought and if brother branham had people leave his church it wasn't a sign that he had failed in the ministry it wasn't a sign that his church wasn't right listen to how brother venom handles this situation aren't you ashamed to make a remark like that ever who you are if you're my kid here in christ i'm ashamed of you so all of a sudden you're offended for the prophet's sake how can you leave this church and go down there and now the prophet says i'm ashamed of you oh i thought i was sticking up for you i didn't realize you didn't want me to do this i didn't realize you'd be ashamed as me i'm ashamed of you don't do a thing like that junior jackson is my brother don ruttle is my brother see this was going on in brother branham's time don't be discouraged by it just love the lord just you know what any time you hear some criticism about yourself or what you believe take it to the lord in prayer and say god is there any truth in what they said i mean that's scary but if there's some truth to it wouldn't you want to make things right wouldn't you want to know so if you hear some criticism about yourself or about something you believe in hey don't be afraid take it to the lord and say lord is there any truth to what they said and if you find out there's a segment of truth then repent say god i'm sorry for that attitude i'm sorry i said it that way i'm sorry i made him feel that way what's so wrong with being real it's almost like we want to live in the in in the image of everything perfect instead of getting down to the reality of where god wants us he wants us to be real if somebody says something against you is critical amen if there's truth to it say hey that part's true i'm sorry i didn't i didn't mean to do that i didn't recognize i'm sorry if you're not sure go to prayer and say god tell me am i wrong praise be to god let's be real i mean if the bride can't be honest who can there's no there's nobody else on the planet that should be able to be as honest as the bride because she should be secure with who she is in christ totally secure totally honest and saying you know maybe there's truth to it so if you come to me and say brother chad so-and-so said we're all like this i said maybe there's truth to it then you'll be ashamed of me let's have the all i want more than anything is be a real christian more than anything in my whole life is i want christ to be preeminent inside of me i don't want my own thoughts my own desires to rule i want christ to rule this tabernacle more than anything more than anything i want to be right with him now he goes the next week so this is what he said in questions and answers on august 23rd on august 30th the next sunday he's doing another questions and answers here's the question that's wrote in we are called now here's the question the other day we are called unclean birds because we go to junior jackson's church sometimes because we're in the he don't comply with new church rules here at the church are we out of the perfect will of god to attend here at times the question is we've been we've been called unclean birds that we said unclean birds by people in brandon tabernacle for going down to junior jackson's because junior jackson doesn't agree with the new rules brother brandon made for his church that's what all this was about when brother branham decided to put the gifts in the little room and bring him to maturity junior jackson thought that they should just operate openly and all the people in the church disagreed went to junior jackson's church that's what this whole issue is about it's about church order but it's not about doctrine it's not about it's just about church it's a matter of church order which every sovereign church has a right to have their own church order we are called unclean birds because we go to junior jackson's church sometimes because he don't comply with the new church rules out here are we out of the perfect will of god to attend here at times now is it wrong for us to visit here like because now we have to be separated oh i'm glad we've got 1200 tapes and that brother branham was honest he said no sir i believe junior jackson to be a man of god i've already explained it i believe now we don't agree upon the order of the church brother branham from the pulpit now junior jackson we don't agree on the order of the church that's not a stumbling point that's not a thing to separate fellowship over we don't agree upon the order of the church now i believe that junior why how many knows junior jackson why we know that man is a godly man he believes this message is the same as i do and he believes these things frankly junior and i are just buddies just like the rest of these men jt and brother ruttle and brother jackson and brother beeler and all these brothers here all of us we're together now we don't might not see just eye to eye alike but we believe the same message and we stick together hallelujah what a great idea why don't we just have this idea and let god lead way he wants to lead let's stay where god wants us to stay let's obey what he tells us to do and let's just love everybody and be happy i don't have to agree and i don't have to pretend i agree but disagreeing doesn't mean that they're not my brother and we can't have fellowship do we understand that there's such insecurity in human beings we feel like if we disagree on one thing we disagree on all things we have to stay separated from one another and now i have to make a decision now they're either bright or they're not bright and i'm going to have to decide because they don't believe like me they must not be my brother because then if they're not my brother i don't have to apply all the things brother brethren said about a brother and all the scripture said about a brother you have to forgive them you have to reconcile you have to have fellowship with them so now in order to bypass all the uncomfortable things brother branham said i've got to make this person not a brother because they don't believe the message they're not really a bride i don't want to be in your position on judgment day because if you called one of god's elect not elect you're in big trouble based off your opinion amen they call you a brother call them a brother they're a brother brother branham called people brothers that are shocking knowing what was in their life knowing the sin knowing what they believed and he still called them brother because they called him a brother and considered themselves christians call him brother don't start trying to determine just say we just don't agree on this was it a major i think it's major do you think it's important yeah i think it's important do you think it's important that the bride agrees on this i think it's important the bride agrees on this well then they must not be right no no no no no because just as soon as you do that then you can make me not bride too if it works one way it works the other unless you're the one who ultimately determines who's in and who's out we're not burning incense at your feet right we've got to quit the strife and the mountain it's all based off insecurity it's a hundred percent based on insecurity because if you're secure in christ and you're secure and what you believe it's okay do you think this is a major issue yeah some of these things are major what do we do about it nothing just keep walking the path god told you to walk and what you might find out is why when you get to the point of a body change you end up on the same road either you move that way or they move this way or you both move through the mill something will happen god's not going to lose his bride and she's going to have the revelation of the word just be careful with the attitude praise god let's go to first corinthians 13. first corinthians 13 and 1. though i speak with the tongue of men and of angels and have not charity i become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol charity here is agape love that we've been talking about and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing what's the greatest commandment love the lord thy god with all thy heart thought thy soul with all thy might and the second is like to the first love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all of the law and all the prophets and mark he says there is none greater commandment than these if i have not love i am nothing brother brahm says in the message humble thyself just think if gifts is so great what we call power and paul said though i have faith that i can move a mountain and have not charity i am nothing think of them and though we say well i understand i wish i know the bible though i understand all the mysteries of god see and still though i could do it and have not charity i am nothing i ain't got nowhere yet see the main thing is love and humble yourself with it now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people i ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in that and if you want to get somewhere with god never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind remember god loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of god is in you you'll love the other person when he's in wrong see just pray for them and love one another above everything love god and love one another and be humble with god and around one another and god will bless us and it's hard telling what he will do usually when a church begins to get in numbers and get get to getting a little bigger or something like that then they get away from that real thing the real thing which is love brother mayor says in the great commission 1958 let me just give you if i found grace in your sight through god you take my word for this brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he is absolutely justly i mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong this is as bad as it gets so let's just paint the picture this is the worst of the worst he's done you wrong and you know he's done you wrong it was intentional on purpose and both of you know it it's not a misunderstanding this is not a you know he might have meant that not no this is everybody knows he did it he meant it you know it he knows it that's the most offensive here's what he says i mean he's done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before god and don't take it in a way of just selfish and say well i'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of god our father way a prayer should be made in the presence of god say father here's my brother and he's justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and i don't see why he did it then let god go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of god you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down here to earth again i love that statement where do you have to go to change your mind and attitude you got to leave the carnal things and enter into the heavenlies when you get back to where to earth again you'll go over that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of god and condemn anybody i don't believe no sir even if he's a rank sinner even you're walking through them through the store and somebody's got tattoo sleeves all over them and dressed in morally and big holes in their ears you take that person and stand with them in the presence of god and you will not condemn that person for what they've done to their body you'll realize that's the manifestation of an evil spirit that came in through a wound somewhere and when god shows you that whole picture you'll say oh god you spared me this road thank you god but i pray that you'd help them in this condition you can't stand before god and condemn anybody even a rank sinner praise be to god what does god want he wants you to act like jesus christ to be able to tell the truth bring righteous judgment and stand on the word no matter what and then act as an intercessor and say god help him bless him further on the quote and what about a brother that has made a mistake though i say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well if we will take him to the throne of god and stand there shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing he's immortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him there's some people whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life their destination isn't dependent on your attitude but there are those who will be given entrance into eternal life that will be able to be in the new heavens and new earth and maybe their destination depends on your attitude maybe they're among us maybe not every single person who attends our church is in the lamb's book of life but maybe they can be given entrance at the white throne judgment and maybe our attitude towards them will determine their eternal destination we've got to be careful friends you know what we're going to need to do die to self the same theme of the whole scripture die if we take him to the throne of god and stand there shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing he's immortal maybe his destination rests upon our attitude towards him when we come back from the throne of god we'll realize that we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from another and the best way to do it is to pray questions and answers 1961. now we're all going to make mistakes just remember how many will confess that's true we're all going to make mistakes you think your day of mistakes are over no sir and some of your mistakes might be to offend or hurt somebody that's sitting next to you near you and you're going to need them to forgive you so you might as well start forgiving them right off the bat now we are all going to make mistakes just remember and when you're looking at one another don't look at the other person's mistake see don't do that because remember you make mistakes too but look to christ who's guiding this person and if they need some help then you pray for them and that's the way we get along pray and remember when you are praying for somebody else in that kind of a fix god will honor and heal you when you're praying for somebody else do you realize how powerful this is you're taking the part of christ and god so honors that that intercession that being an advocate and advocating for a brother he so honors that that while you're in the middle of praying for somebody else god will heal your body praise be to god sometimes what we need to do is just die to ourselves forget our problems and start interceding for one another we all have to come higher friends every one of us have to come up higher the whole body of christ has got to move up higher and higher and higher we've got to stand in the gap for one another we got to stand in the gap for the one that irritates you stand in the gap for them until you can love them through that irritation so you can see there's a heart laying down in there and i love that brother i love that sister we got to stand for one another who else is going to stand for us if we don't stand for one another who's going to advocate for the bride if the bride doesn't advocate for one another nobody else on this earth is going to do it remember when you're praying for somebody else in that kind of a fix god will honor and heal you when you're praying for somebody else that's right that's what christianity is based upon to help one another do for another one another be kind to one another understanding to one another hallelujah you know what this is real christianity the real deal not when everybody comes to church for a 20-minute sermon we all say god loves you we love each other and we go out but when you stomp on your neighbor's toe and he says i forgive you for that and you say thank you i didn't mean to i'm sorry the real christianity when hurts difficulties and all kinds of statements are made and you can take it and say god forgive them for my sake i know they didn't mean i know they wouldn't have done if they understood the whole situation they wouldn't have said that if they really understood they wouldn't have made that kind of judgment they wouldn't have made that kind of statement god i forgive them and i ask you to forgive them too can we do that let's turn to ezekiel we're going to finish with this scripture in ezekiel if the musicians and brother jim would like to come let's go to ezekiel 22. the apostle paul said beware when you bite and devour one another lest you be consumed one of another we're here to build up the body of christ not tear it down not to bite devour to be consumed one of another but we're here to bless to encourage to establish to build up the body of christ let's look at ezekiel chapter 22 verse 29 the people of the land have used depression and exercise robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yay they have oppressed a stranger wrongfully so you see here they're in error is that right they're in there let's look at what they've done they've used oppression exercised robbery vexed the poor in the needy they've oppressed the stranger wrongfully they are wrong verse 30 and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none therefore have i poured out my indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i recompensed upon their heads saith the lord god they were guilty they had done wrong god did not just want to pour out his wrath but before he poured out his wrath and judgment he was looking for a man that would make up the hedge i looked for a man to make up the hedge i looked god was looking for a man to stand in the gap but he found none and when he found none he poured out the judgment i said god i pray that you don't have to be looking for a man but let me be the man my brother's wrong let me stand god teach me how to stand in the gap teach me how to make up the hedge teach me how to come alongside a brother and say god forgive them they don't know what they're doing god is looking he needed moses he would have destroyed them had not moses he needed moses in ezekiel's day he was needing a man he was needing somebody he would make up the hedge and stand in the gap and because there was none there he had no choice but to pour out the wrath and i'm telling you today he needs somebody to stand in the gap he needs somebody to stand in the gap for their brother and sister need somebody to stand in the gap for this dark and dying world he needs somebody to stand in the gap because he's a righteous judge he's a righteous god and if something is if something's wrong he's got to judge it unless he can find somebody that'll stand in the gap i don't want to be an old cantankerous selfish spirit that says you do me wrong god's going to get you god's going to give you and when it happens that's because you know that's got to go away every time somebody sees something say oh god help my brother help my sister something goes wrong say god forgive him i forgive him i ask you to forgive him amen that's the kind of life i want to live that's the kind of christianity that's real that's the kind of bride jesus christ is looking for and i say god help us all pour out your spirit upon us pour the balm in us and heal us lord bind up the brokenhearted set the captives free that we can be what you've called us to be in this hour that we can do what you've asked us to do how many want to go free let's all stand the apostle paul says he said i would i would be a castaway from christ for my brethren to be saved do you realize what he's saying i would he said if he could do it he would be willing to be a cast away from christ so that his kinsmen the jews could be saved moses said blot my name out forgive them and if not blot my name out i don't think moses was kidding and when paul says i would be a castaway that my brethren my kinsfolk would be saved he wasn't kidding who had more revelation than moses and paul what did their revelation do what kind of position did that revelation put them in that revelation did not make them arrogant condescending critical judgmental that revelation caused them to stand in the gap to the point of losing their selves to save others what kind of revelation did jesus christ have enough revelation to lose himself to stand in the gap for others to give of himself i tell you friends when i look at what paul says and i look at what moses said i can tell you right now i'm not where i'm supposed to be i have not arrived to that place i am not where i'm supposed to be in the scriptures but i want to be i want god to break me down and get me to the point where i can from my heart say lord if you have to lose me to save others lose me to save them because that's a heart of christ god's sovereign if his name's in the book the names in the book but moses meant it paul a minute i want to be able to mean it i want to be able to give our life so somebody else can be saved give up on the hurt give up on the offense for somebody else to say and i want to mean it from the bottom of my heart i think there's room for us to grow do you believe there's room to grow i believe there's room for us to grow let's just bow our heads dear lord jesus we thank you god we thank you father lord for your word god how hard your word is how unflexible lord but lord we choose as a body of believers lord to throw ourselves down upon that stone this morning and be broken all over again for god i realize i'm not where i'm supposed to be i don't have the heart like i'm supposed to have i don't have what i saw in moses or what i saw in paul but lord i know you're growing it in me i can see it coming lord god i pray that you would bless your children that are here that are wounded and hurt i pray that you pour in the balm lord that your spirit would begin to mend all the broken places lord that you would begin to heal lord and set the captives free from the hurt and injury from the past make their hearts whole lord so they're able to forgive others able to forgive offenses able to let go able lord to be what you called us to be you said that the bride will be so much like him in his image she will be him let us live that kind of life i pray you forgive us lord where we've been judgmental and critical lord if anybody any of us has spoke evil of another assembly forgive us now in jesus name of another ministry lord forgive us of other believers forgive us lord help us lord to edify help us to bless help us to speak those things that you would want to speak help us to stand on the truth and never waver never compromise and never have to agree just for agreement's sake help us to stay true to your word that's our love to you but lord put in our hearts a desire to stand alongside a brother in error and see them lord lift it up see them in the right spot give us a heart lord for intercession as well god let us be both let us be like you on this earth we love your father and ask that you would move upon us lord this word drive it into our hearts and bring fruit out of it we love you we worship you in jesus christ's name amen we sing a song i love you lord and i lift my voice i love you lord i think it's i got a number let's go to number 724 i love you lord and i lift myself to worship you [Music] take joy make me [Applause] i love you you [Music] me [Applause] make me [Applause] my voice [Music] my sweet sounds amen i love you all with the love of the lord and i believe with all my heart if we can just throw ourselves on that stone on christ the word and say god you've got to put me together the way you want me i'm all wrong and i'm all undone i can't help myself every time i try i make a mess but lord if i can just throw myself on that stone and then you can take and put the pieces back together the way you want it i want to be what you want me to be more than anything else in my life i want to be what you want me to be and if that can become the desire of our heart the first commandment love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all my soul with all my mind and the second love thy neighbor as thyself all the law rests on this and there's no commandment greater than these i say god let that live inside of me if we can have that desire i believe god will meet us i believe he'll empower us i believe his spirit will come to quicken that word in our lives because we're taking it straight from him amen be in peace with everyone live at peace with all men as much as is possible love your neighbor love your brothers and sisters pray for one another let's bind our hearts together and lift one another up don't tear anybody down ever say as many nice things about everybody as you can and the one who's hurt you the most say the nicest things about it until we can break ourselves of this habit but the member said if you have a habit doing something do the opposite so if somebody's hurt you and they've hurt you bad and you can't be anything but critical then you start saying every nice thing you can say about that individual until that thing's broken until you actually start to see some good qualities and they're not a bad person praise god amen god bless you we'll let you be dismissed let's sing that song i give my mind make it all brand new i just wanna think like [Music] [Applause] let me live teach me me to you like [Music] teach me to be [Music] make it all brand new [Applause] [Music] i just want to thank you you shall love the lord with all your heart for your soul you shall love the lord with all your lord you shall love the lord with all your all your souls with all your soul with all your mind once again you shall love the lord with all your you heart love the lord with all your all your souls with all your minds for all the my things [Music] lord sister teresa wants the church to pray for her and ezra you know many of you know but there's been a lot of scarring a lot of hurt a lot of wrong but god can he can heal it all he's the one who binds up the brokenhearted and sets captives free at liberty and she's asking for the whole church to pray can we bind together and pray that god will break the yokes of bondage that god will set the captives free that god will do a restoration work that nobody else on earth can do but him that god can get all the glory and all the credit for what he's going to do can we believe that he'll do it amen we're going to ask it in jesus name together as a body of believers we're going to stand together that's why god put us together in a body to bear one another's burdens and and there's things that in the human realm were impossible to overcome unless something supernatural takes place and we're asking for the supernatural to take place dear lord jesus i lay hands on my brother ezra and sister teresa and god you know the sacrifice she made just to come down and ask the church to pray god she did it because she wants you to have your way she wants you to be glorified and god has a body of believers we stand here together with them shoulder to shoulder lord with our arms around them and we're praying lord that you would forgive lord
