[17:06] certainly good to be here together again
[17:08] we appreciate that special this evening
[17:10] and the sisters who saying it and then
[17:12] while you're standing let's just go to
[17:14] the Bible to First Corinthians I'd like
[17:17] to continue with the same thought from
[17:18] Sunday and there's just a few more
[17:20] things there's some notes that I skipped
[17:22] over and some thoughts I wanted to share
[17:24] so we're going to continue on with that
[17:26] I did speak to brother Emanuel today in
[17:29] um he said brother Burley is actually
[17:30] returning home tomorrow but he's staying
[17:32] an additional week so brother Emanuel
[17:34] will stay until uh Thursday September
[17:37] 5th so please remember to keep him in
[17:39] your prayers he'll be flying solo now
[17:41] have no help he'll be doing the work
[17:42] himself but uh he said there was quite a
[17:45] few requests quite a few uh pastors who
[17:47] were requesting more meetings so he felt
[17:49] in his heart to stay and do that so I'm
[17:52] quite sure he'll be very busy this next
[17:54] week so please be praying for him also
[17:57] wanted to let you know that that sister
[17:59] Pat McKenna passed away and some of you
[18:02] may know her husband brother McKenna was
[18:04] actually the first Pastor in the Lima
[18:07] area to carry the message but the family
[18:09] has asked brother Gabe Smith to do the
[18:11] funeral so he'll be doing that funeral
[18:13] this Saturday there'll be a viewing on
[18:15] Friday evening and a funeral Saturday so
[18:17] please remember our brother Gabe in
[18:19] prayer that the Lord will inspire him
[18:21] and bless him to be a blessing to the
[18:23] family there and bring honor to the name
[18:25] of our sister amen so just remember him
[18:28] in
[18:29] prayer let's look together at 1
[18:31] Corinthians chapter
[18:34] 1 1 Corinthians chapter
[18:37] 1 and verse 21 we read this scripture uh
[18:41] Sunday but I want to start with it now
[18:44] uh 1 Corinthians
[18:45] 1:21 for after that in the wisdom of God
[18:48] the World by wisdom knew not God it
[18:51] pleased God by the foolishness of
[18:52] preaching to save them that believe and
[18:56] God bless you as you have your seats
[19:00] it's amazing he didn't it didn't please
[19:03] the god to use the foolishness of
[19:04] preaching just to save them that
[19:07] heard but to save them that
[19:10] believe amen so God was going to use the
[19:12] foolishness of preaching the preaching
[19:14] of the word to save his children but he
[19:17] was going to save them that believe so
[19:19] it required two parts it required the
[19:22] preaching of the word but it also
[19:23] required a heart that could believe the
[19:25] word it wasn't one-sided amen and that's
[19:28] what we begin to look at on Sunday and
[19:30] something I want to continue to look at
[19:32] it wasn't that that you can just come
[19:35] under the anointed preaching of the word
[19:37] and the inspired preaching and the true
[19:39] word and then all of a sudden under the
[19:40] inspired preaching of the true word that
[19:42] everybody sits there and everybody hears
[19:44] and everybody who even intellectually
[19:46] comprehends what's being said that
[19:48] doesn't mean that that's going to do the
[19:50] work but that's the method he's going to
[19:52] save Amen to save his children but he's
[19:55] going to save those that
[19:57] believe amen
[20:00] but those that believe have to hear the
[20:03] foolishness of
[20:04] preaching God's working with both sides
[20:07] now we looked at the word save here and
[20:10] uh we discussed this Sunday but I want
[20:11] to just bring it back to your
[20:13] remembrance the Greek word is soo uh and
[20:17] and it means to save to make whole to
[20:20] heal to be whole so it doesn't like like
[20:24] I said before many times we get
[20:26] understanding and ideas of what it means
[20:28] to be sa saved amen because of
[20:30] denominational ideas but this word save
[20:33] in the Bible actually means to save or
[20:35] or or to rescue but also to make whole
[20:39] to heal one of the meanings is to to
[20:41] save keep safe and sound to rescue from
[20:44] danger or destruction also to save a
[20:47] suffering one uh for example one's
[20:49] suffering from disease to make well heal
[20:51] restore to health to preserve one who is
[20:53] in danger of Destruction to save or to
[20:56] rescue so God is using the full
[20:58] foolishness of preaching to save them
[21:00] that believe amen and like we said
[21:02] before this this scripture actually
[21:05] confused me a little bit through the
[21:06] years because I thought why do we
[21:08] continually come back to the foolishness
[21:09] of preaching if we're already saved but
[21:11] the reality is we still need to be made
[21:13] whole we still need healing amen this
[21:16] healing from this disease of
[21:17] hybridization amen of all the
[21:19] afflictions that have come upon us
[21:21] because we were born wrong in this Human
[21:23] Experience we have is the foolishness of
[21:25] preaching that's saving us making us
[21:27] whole restoring us and keeping us
[21:30] rescuing us from danger and destruction
[21:32] let's go to Psalms 107
[21:45] now Psalms
[21:52] 107 107 and let's begin reading at verse
[21:57] 19 19 and 20 then they cry unto the Lord
[22:01] in their trouble and he saveth them out
[22:03] of their distress he sent his word and
[22:06] healed them and delivered them from
[22:08] their destructions so when God was going
[22:10] to heal them and deliver them from their
[22:12] destructions when they Cried unto him
[22:14] and their distress he saved them what
[22:16] did he do he sent his
[22:17] word amen so that's how God Saves that's
[22:21] how God heals that how God delivers from
[22:24] destruction is he sends his word praise
[22:27] be to God
[22:29] amen now let's go and look back at Luke
[22:31] 8 I started with this on Sunday but I
[22:35] want to briefly review it and move from
[22:44] there it's amazing when we listen to the
[22:46] prophet of God he's over and over
[22:48] talking about the word the word the word
[22:50] the word the word so much about the word
[22:52] because we realize this is the age that
[22:54] the word is being restored and the word
[22:56] is having an effect in this day and it's
[22:58] bringing about everything that was
[23:00] prophesied in the word is coming to
[23:01] culmination under the preaching of the
[23:03] word and the restoration of the word
[23:05] because he sent his word and healed them
[23:09] and delivered them from destruction
[23:11] what's delivering us because in this day
[23:13] he sent his word He restored back the
[23:15] word that had been lost through the
[23:16] through the church ages he sent his word
[23:19] and he's healing us and delivering us
[23:21] from
[23:22] destruction in Luke chapter 8 verse 4
[23:26] this is the parable of the seed swer he
[23:28] says in uh Luke 8:4 and when much people
[23:32] were gathered together and were come to
[23:33] him out of every city spake by a parable
[23:36] and a serwer went out to sew his seed
[23:38] and as he sowed some fell by the wayside
[23:40] and it was trotten down and the fowls of
[23:42] the air devoured it and some fell upon a
[23:45] rock and as soon as it was sprung up it
[23:48] withered away because it lacked moisture
[23:50] and some fell among thorns and the thorn
[23:52] sprang up with it and choked it and
[23:55] other fell on good ground and sprang up
[23:57] and bare fruit 100 fold when he had said
[24:00] these things he cried he that hath ears
[24:02] to hear Let Him hear and his disciples
[24:05] asked him saying what might this Parable
[24:08] be and he said unto you it is given to
[24:10] know the mysteries of the kingdom of God
[24:12] but to others in Parables that seeing
[24:15] they may not see and hearing they may
[24:16] not understand now the parable is this
[24:19] the seed is the word of
[24:21] God those by the wayside are they that
[24:24] hear then cometh the devil and taketh
[24:26] away the word out of their hearts lest
[24:28] they believe and be
[24:30] saved they on the Rock are they which
[24:33] when they hear receive the word with joy
[24:35] and these have no root which for a while
[24:37] believe and in time of Temptations fall
[24:40] away and that which fell among Thorns
[24:42] are they which when they have heard go
[24:44] forth and are choked with cares and
[24:45] riches and pleasures of this life and
[24:48] bring no fruit to Perfection but that on
[24:51] the good ground are they which in an
[24:52] honest and good heart having heard the
[24:54] word keep it and bring forth fruit with
[24:57] patience
[24:59] man so we looked at this Parable and we
[25:01] begin to see that there was only one
[25:04] place that the seed would grow to bear
[25:07] fruit and that was in good ground and we
[25:09] begin to talk about the ground uh that
[25:12] we talked about predestinated ground
[25:14] good ground because the good ground had
[25:16] been cleared the good ground had been
[25:18] cleared of rubble cleared of thorns the
[25:20] good ground had been plowed the good
[25:22] ground had been prepared there was good
[25:24] ground ready to receive the seed amen
[25:27] and the ground didn't prepare itself
[25:29] amen it was somebody else the farmer the
[25:32] husbandman who knew that seed was going
[25:34] to come who made sure there was ground
[25:36] ready to receive the
[25:38] seed so the seed swer was tossing seed
[25:41] everywhere amen and the seed is the word
[25:43] of God the word of God is going
[25:45] everywhere it's being it's being uh
[25:47] broadcast all the time amen but there's
[25:50] good ground amen that if this seed can
[25:52] fall into that good ground that the
[25:54] husbandman has prepared to receive this
[25:56] seed then it'll bring forth a Bountiful
[26:00] Harvest now there's a a couple things I
[26:02] want to look at here the the there was
[26:05] only one place now the seed is the word
[26:08] of God the word of God Amen is powerful
[26:11] the word of God is quick and sharper
[26:14] than any two-edged sword the word of God
[26:16] has life in it amen the word of God is
[26:19] God God is his word amen is that what
[26:22] that what the prophet told us amen but
[26:24] yet as powerful as this word is this
[26:27] word would only replicate itself when it
[26:29] fell in the good ground this this word
[26:32] as powerful as it was didn't have the
[26:34] power Amen to replicate itself and come
[26:37] to maturity and bear forth the fruit of
[26:39] the life inside only when it fell in
[26:41] this one spot so now the seed needs the
[26:45] ground and the ground needs the seed and
[26:47] when these two entities come together
[26:49] then the life of the seed will come into
[26:51] the ground spring forth amen and now
[26:54] begin to Bear a life amen and now the
[26:57] ground will be covered covered with
[26:58] another life and you won't see ground
[27:00] anymore all you'll see is fruit of this
[27:02] seed amen you'll look and say you won't
[27:05] look at a field and anymore say there's
[27:07] dirt that's not dirt that's
[27:10] wheat but the wheat needed the
[27:14] dirt but you don't look at the field
[27:17] anymore and say that's dirt you say
[27:18] that's
[27:20] wheat and the only place that that seed
[27:23] can convert amen and and come into
[27:26] maturity and manifest the life in side
[27:28] is only in the good
[27:31] ground okay so that becomes really
[27:34] important so God Amen God's agenda is to
[27:37] put these two things together to put his
[27:39] word together with the good ground amen
[27:41] then bring his word to life and
[27:43] manifestation the to manifest the life
[27:45] that's in the
[27:47] word
[27:48] amen so
[27:51] now uh in the in the message again God's
[27:53] power to transform there's a couple
[27:56] quotes that I'm going to read today that
[27:57] I read again on Sunday I'm going to I'm
[27:59] just going to bring it to your memory
[28:00] but there's some others that I skipped
[28:02] over a few pages but I'm going to go
[28:04] back and many of them again are out of
[28:05] either God's power to transform or the
[28:08] power of
[28:09] transformation and he says and
[28:11] everything under control to bring forth
[28:13] of its kind now remember to bring when
[28:16] he put the seed in the Earth the seed
[28:18] can only come forth with the power of
[28:20] life within it to transform it from a
[28:23] seed to a plant or whatever it was his
[28:26] transforming power now God God put the
[28:28] seed in there with potentials and it
[28:31] would be what he said it would be so the
[28:34] life in the seed was already in the seed
[28:38] it was already the potential there the
[28:40] life was there Amen to bring it to bring
[28:43] it to whatever life was in it it had the
[28:46] power to manifest itself but it was
[28:48] going to have to fall into good ground
[28:51] and in the right conditions then it
[28:52] would go through the process but the
[28:54] life was already in it the power to
[28:56] transform itself from seed back to the
[28:59] plant back to Fruit
[29:00] again but it was going to require the
[29:03] conditions were right further down the
[29:05] same quote and he said and each one of
[29:07] those seeds has power in itself to
[29:10] transform itself into the species that I
[29:12] desire it to be that's what it must be
[29:14] because I have given every seed
[29:16] transforming power to make out of itself
[29:19] in its potentials now to make out of
[29:21] itself exactly what I want it to be this
[29:24] is absolutely So Glorious because God
[29:27] has an idea of what he wants his bride
[29:29] to be in this age and he knows exactly
[29:32] what he wants to manifest in order for
[29:34] him to manifest in his guarden of you
[29:37] all the things that he wants to manifest
[29:39] amen he's going to have to send a seed
[29:41] and in that seed is his word and in that
[29:43] seed has the power to transform itself
[29:46] into the very life that's in the seed so
[29:49] God now amen in order to get us to be a
[29:52] Garden of Eden for him a garden for our
[29:54] bridegroom amen he didn't ask be dirt to
[29:57] all the a sudden become a flourishing
[29:59] Garden what he did is asked you to yield
[30:02] to the hand of the farmer amen and he
[30:04] would put the right seed in the right
[30:06] spot in the right time in the right
[30:08] season and all of a sudden before you
[30:10] know it he's got a lush Garden amen with
[30:12] every fruit and every all the fruits of
[30:14] the spirit and all the Life of Christ
[30:16] reflecting the very nature of the
[30:18] husbandman is now reflected in the
[30:21] garden because he knows that the life is
[30:24] in the seed he's not asking the garden
[30:26] amen you Garden just produce pomegranate
[30:29] the garden couldn't produce pomegranate
[30:31] he had to sew pomegranate into the
[30:33] garden to get pomegranate that's why in
[30:36] this age when he wanted a bride to stand
[30:38] in His image he had to bring a word with
[30:40] the life in the word to reproduce itself
[30:43] but he had to find good ground
[30:45] predestinated soil for it to drop
[30:49] into praise be to God and listen the
[30:52] reason I'm preaching this is because we
[30:54] get so discouraged because I'm not yet
[30:56] bearing pomegranates and I'm not yet
[30:58] doing this and I'm not yet doing that
[31:00] but listen friends the power is in the
[31:02] seed the power is in the word just keep
[31:05] receiving the word keep opening your
[31:07] heart let it fall into the good ground
[31:09] that God has predetermined will be the
[31:11] ground for that seed to come in and let
[31:13] it go through the
[31:15] process and bring forth life have
[31:17] confidence in the
[31:21] seed amen we've too long looked in the
[31:24] mirror to try to figure out if it's
[31:26] working or not
[31:30] amen I don't know about you but looking
[31:32] in the mirror is a good place for me to
[31:33] get
[31:34] discouraged but I need to look into this
[31:37] mirror and I need to see that the he
[31:39] sowed the right seed he's going to have
[31:41] the right Harvest he's not going to
[31:44] fail amen let's look together at ISA
[31:47] Isaiah turn with me to Isaiah chapter 7
[32:06] Isaiah chapter
[32:07] 7 and let's look at verse
[32:11] 14 says therefore the Lord himself shall
[32:15] give you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[32:17] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[32:20] his name
[32:22] Emmanuel so here through Isaiah the
[32:26] prophet God sends out his
[32:28] word he sends his word out and he and he
[32:31] swws this word out into the world this
[32:34] was a thought of God and now the thought
[32:36] of God is being expressed as a spoken
[32:39] word coming from Isaiah amen and this
[32:41] word this prophecy has the power within
[32:45] itself to replicate itself that's right
[32:47] that's right it's the word of God is it
[32:49] not the word of God with the thought of
[32:51] God has the very thought within it amen
[32:54] to replicate
[32:56] itself but for 700 years the prophet of
[32:59] God told us that prophecy was moving
[33:01] about wandering it was it was moving
[33:04] over the Earth what was it doing it was
[33:05] waiting for a beding ground to fall into
[33:07] so that it could reproduce itself that's
[33:11] let's go to Isaiah 55
[33:17] together Isaiah
[33:23] 55 55 and
[33:26] 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth
[33:29] out of my mouth it shall not return unto
[33:32] me void but it shall accomplish that
[33:34] which I please and it shall prosper in
[33:36] the thing whereto I sent
[33:38] it that means when God speaks a word it
[33:41] is going to come to pass amen there's
[33:44] nothing going to hinder it nothing going
[33:46] to stop it now when God said a virgin
[33:48] shall conceive it didn't matter how many
[33:50] wrong interpretations they had it didn't
[33:52] matter how many people had misunderstood
[33:54] what he meant by that tried themselves
[33:56] to bring it to pass tried to interpret
[33:59] it had that had no bearing on the power
[34:01] that was in that word cuz when God sent
[34:03] the word it shall accomplish the thing
[34:05] he sent it for and it shall not return
[34:08] unto him void but it will accomplish
[34:11] that which he sent it for so though
[34:14] though it's a 100 years now 200 years
[34:16] pass then 300 years pass and Isaiah the
[34:19] prophecy Isaiah keeps marching on and on
[34:21] and then people may the Jews may have
[34:23] believed oh it's already prophesied it's
[34:26] already fulfilled and the Virgin of
[34:28] Israel's this and that and no it will be
[34:31] when when this and this happen it
[34:33] doesn't matter none of that matters
[34:34] because that is God's word that come out
[34:37] of his mouth and it has the power to
[34:39] replicate itself in God's due season in
[34:41] God's appointed
[34:43] place it won't return it doesn't matter
[34:45] what people do with it doesn't change
[34:47] the fact that the word is
[34:50] perfect doesn't matter how many people
[34:52] fail while they wait doesn't matter how
[34:56] many people fall away and the waiting
[34:58] period it doesn't matter how much
[34:59] confusion surrounds that prophecy none
[35:02] of that matters because that prophecy
[35:04] will complete the task it was sent for
[35:08] amen and won't return to him
[35:11] void so let's go to Luke chapter 1
[35:16] now let's find the landing spot the
[35:19] landing pad for this
[35:24] prophecy Luke chapter 1
[35:28] in verse
[35:30] 26 Luke 1
[35:35] 26 and in the sixth month an the angel
[35:38] Gabriel was sent from God into a city of
[35:40] Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin
[35:43] espouse to a man whose name was Joseph
[35:45] of the House of David the virgin's name
[35:47] was Mary and the angel came in unto her
[35:50] and said hail thou th hail thou that are
[35:53] highly favored the Lord is with thee
[35:55] blessed art thou among women and when
[35:57] she saw him she was troubled at his
[35:59] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[36:01] of salutation this would
[36:04] be and the angel said unto her fear not
[36:07] Mary for thou Hast found favor with God
[36:09] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[36:11] womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[36:13] call his name Jesus he shall be great
[36:15] and shall be called the son of the
[36:16] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[36:19] him the Throne of his father David and
[36:21] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[36:23] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[36:25] be no end then said Mary unto the angel
[36:28] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[36:31] man and the angel answered and said unto
[36:33] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[36:36] and the power of the highest shall
[36:37] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[36:40] thing which shall be born in thee shall
[36:42] be called The Son of God and behold thy
[36:44] cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived
[36:47] a son in her old age and this is the
[36:49] sixth month with her who was called
[36:50] Baron for with God nothing shall be
[36:53] impossible and Mary said behold the
[36:55] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[36:57] according to Thy word and the angel
[37:00] departed from her so here is here is
[37:03] Mary she doesn't know that in her
[37:05] lifetime that she is the good ground
[37:07] that God intended for this seed to fall
[37:09] in she has no knowledge of that she's
[37:12] just a regular person doing regular
[37:13] person things in her day amen going
[37:15] about her life but an angel God sends an
[37:18] angel messeng to her to tell her amen
[37:20] that now is the season now is the time
[37:22] and you're the bedding
[37:24] ground and she's confused about natural
[37:27] things as all of us would be how can
[37:29] this be and and immediately listen
[37:31] immediately she begins to look for ways
[37:34] that she can bring about the
[37:36] promise how can this be because I have
[37:39] not known a man so it's physically
[37:41] impossible for me to bring forth this
[37:44] prophecy and God was not looking for her
[37:46] to physically be able to bring forth the
[37:49] prophecy all he's looking for is
[37:51] somebody that will believe the word that
[37:53] this messenger gives her so that they
[37:54] can be the betting ground for this
[37:56] prophecy to bring forth of
[37:58] itself he's got the life of the word the
[38:01] Holy Ghost there to make sure that that
[38:03] word comes to pass inside of her amen
[38:06] she doesn't have to make it come to pass
[38:08] God has sent everything she needs he
[38:10] sent a messenger to tell her this is the
[38:12] appointed time you're the appointed
[38:14] person he's going to send the Holy Ghost
[38:16] to bring life to the very word that he
[38:18] promised to bring to life she doesn't
[38:20] have to manufacture anything she doesn't
[38:22] have to work up anything she doesn't
[38:24] have to try to do anything there's only
[38:26] one thing she has to do is surrender to
[38:28] the word that messenger told her and
[38:30] believe what God
[38:35] said it's so simple in the scriptures
[38:37] why does it become so hard in our
[38:40] lives as if somehow we're standing in a
[38:43] different spot than Mary
[38:47] is she says be it unto me according to
[38:50] Thy word God had sent a messenger to
[38:53] tell her the word of God to tell her the
[38:56] prophecy to to to to remind her of the
[38:59] prophecy and tell her you're the one
[39:01] you're the place you're the time that's
[39:03] now and she she had the audacity just to
[39:06] surrender and say be it unto me
[39:08] according to your
[39:10] word and we know that she
[39:13] conceived in the church age book under
[39:16] the section of pick up your pin and
[39:18] write when the angel tells brother BR
[39:20] pick up your pen and write it's the
[39:22] italicized uh section in the pergami and
[39:24] church age says the Word of Promise came
[39:27] to the Virgin Mary but that Word of
[39:29] Promise was he himself to be made
[39:32] manifest God was made manifest he
[39:35] himself acted at that time and fulfilled
[39:37] his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it
[39:40] was an angel that had brought her the
[39:41] message but the Angel's message was the
[39:43] word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at
[39:46] that time all that was written of him
[39:49] because I love this word
[39:52] because you want to hear what he says
[39:54] afterwards
[39:57] he fulfilled at that time all that was
[40:00] written of him because nothing could
[40:02] stop it because he plowed through
[40:03] because
[40:05] no because she accepted his word to
[40:15] her when you look at things like this it
[40:18] becomes
[40:19] astounding the way listen this isn't the
[40:21] prophet saying this this is pick up your
[40:23] pin and write this is a message from the
[40:26] angel of the Lord to the to the bride
[40:29] and he's saying that everything that was
[40:32] prophesied he was going to do himself it
[40:35] was he came himself he he fulfilled
[40:37] himself the word he promised for that
[40:39] ever he did it all himself because she
[40:44] accepted his word to
[40:46] her as powerful as that prophecy
[40:50] was it had to have good
[40:55] ground or it wouldn't come forth
[41:00] right she was the predestinated good
[41:03] ground God foresaw her before the
[41:05] foundation of the world but there was
[41:08] something she had to do and that was
[41:11] surrender to the
[41:13] prophecy yield surrender her life and
[41:16] say be it unto me according to your word
[41:19] amen and he performed at that time all
[41:23] that was promised in the word because
[41:25] she accepted his word to
[41:29] her see she started with a mental
[41:32] battle she started with a struggle of
[41:35] how can this be how can
[41:38] I come on brother how long have we
[41:41] struggled with mental battles of how can
[41:43] this be and how can I amen H why me I'm
[41:47] nobody I'm from Nazareth no nothing good
[41:49] comes from Nazareth why me I'm already
[41:51] espoused to a man I come from no family
[41:53] I'm nothing special why me I can't even
[41:56] do what you're asking asking me to do
[41:57] I'm know no man I'm a virgin I have no
[41:59] ability to bring forth This Promise why
[42:01] me how me why and why for years and
[42:04] decades do we keep struggling with why
[42:06] me and how me and and I can't do it
[42:09] instead of just simply saying I don't
[42:11] know how I don't know why you chose me I
[42:13] don't know how it's going to happen but
[42:15] this one thing I know that something in
[42:17] me believes what that messenger just
[42:19] said what that angel just said and all I
[42:21] can say is be it unto me according to
[42:23] your word I can't bring it to pass I
[42:26] can't make it come to pass I can't be
[42:29] the bride that you've prophesied that
[42:31] I'll be in this end time I can't be that
[42:33] bride that that Prophet said was going
[42:35] to be standing here without spot without
[42:37] wrinkle shining in the glory of Christ
[42:40] very with the very display of Jesus
[42:42] Christ emanating from her flesh I cannot
[42:45] be that I cannot do that I don't have
[42:48] the power there's nothing in me that's
[42:50] capable of Performing that I can't do
[42:54] it but be it unto me according to the
[42:57] prophecy of that messenger if he said
[42:59] it's for me to do if he said it's for
[43:01] now to do then it's going to happen
[43:04] because God's going to send the power to
[43:06] bring the word to pass because the power
[43:08] is in the
[43:11] prophecy just looking for good ground
[43:17] friends let's turn to the Book of
[43:22] John John chapter 8
[43:29] remember brother BR said man's a failure
[43:30] to begin
[43:32] with
[43:34] perfect can't do nothing right can't get
[43:36] anything right perfect but that's the
[43:39] place that he wants to manifest his
[43:41] word and if he chose to do it that way
[43:44] why am I constantly trying to talk him
[43:46] out of
[43:50] it that was his choice he chose to put
[43:53] himself on partnership with man he chose
[43:55] to bring the prophecy out of Fallen man
[43:58] he chose to fulfill the Plan of
[43:59] Redemption through mankind he chose to
[44:02] preach through the foolishness of
[44:03] preaching he chose all of these methods
[44:06] I didn't choose them he chose them amen
[44:08] why am I constantly trying to argue with
[44:10] him as if he doesn't know what he's
[44:12] doing instead of just accepting that he
[44:15] knows what he's doing he's got the power
[44:16] to bring it to
[44:18] pass and in John
[44:21] 8:37 Jesus he's he's in dialogue here
[44:25] with the the Pharisees and we're not
[44:26] going to get into all of it I just want
[44:27] to pull out one statement said I know
[44:29] that you're Abraham's seed but you seek
[44:31] to kill me because my word hath no place
[44:34] in
[44:36] you he started to identify yes naturally
[44:39] you're of the lineage of Abraham later
[44:40] he said you're not Abraham's seed
[44:43] spiritually this was only a natural
[44:45] acknowledgement but he's saying but you
[44:47] seek to kill me why because my word has
[44:50] no place in you because you're not the
[44:52] good
[44:54] ground there's no receiving set there's
[44:57] there's no receptor there's no place for
[44:59] my word to fall in
[45:04] you it's
[45:07] amazing when Jesus Christ was here his
[45:10] very presence his very presence brought
[45:13] brought every seed in the field to full
[45:15] Harvest maturity amen and and and I'm
[45:19] getting ahead of myself but just I want
[45:20] you to listen to me now when that bright
[45:23] light of the word made manifest in
[45:26] jesus' day when he was there that was
[45:28] the fullness of the word it was shining
[45:29] through a vessel it was shining through
[45:31] a man and it was so bright that not any
[45:34] seed whether it was wheat or tear could
[45:35] stay in immaturity but everything had to
[45:37] spring up and bear fruit of what was on
[45:39] the inside of it and it was that Shining
[45:42] Light that actually bound the tears and
[45:45] separated the wheat because the tears
[45:47] bound themselves together to persecute
[45:49] the
[45:50] light this is why Herod became friends
[45:53] with pilate and pilate and Herod were in
[45:55] conspiracy with the Jews amen all the
[45:57] tears just wrapped themselves together
[45:59] because under the bright light
[46:01] everything in the field came to full
[46:02] Harvest maturity right
[46:05] then amen and the same thing's happening
[46:09] in our
[46:11] day he says again in power of
[46:13] transformation he says now he had all
[46:15] this in mind and he
[46:18] said he said let there be now that's
[46:21] Genesis 1 said let there be this let
[46:23] there be that he was sewing seed let it
[46:26] be here Let It Be Here let it be here
[46:29] and he was and he knew it was going to
[46:31] be that way because it cannot
[46:33] change that's why when he says a virgin
[46:36] shall
[46:37] conceive he can't later come and say no
[46:40] it's a married woman who's already had
[46:41] two
[46:42] children because that seed can only
[46:45] bring forth of its kind can't change it
[46:48] it's already got life embedded in it
[46:51] it's already got certain genetic code
[46:53] inside so he says now it cannot change
[46:57] now that gives us Faith then and what he
[46:59] said here it's going to be so let's let
[47:01] that seed fall into our
[47:03] hearts that we might be the beding
[47:05] grounds of that se into our hearts what
[47:08] do I have to do with this word believe
[47:11] it and receive
[47:13] it what do I have to do with this
[47:15] message believe it and receive it and
[47:17] that believing I can't do by myself amen
[47:20] I believe by faith it's by the grace of
[47:23] God it's a gift of God and not of myself
[47:26] the Fai to believe is a gift of God
[47:28] meaning that I've got something to
[47:29] believe with and that is the grace
[47:31] that's a gift of
[47:33] God but now I still have this free moral
[47:36] agency that I can receive what's being
[47:39] spoke I can accept it I can I can
[47:42] receive it and let it fall into the
[47:43] beding ground of my heart that I don't
[47:45] keep holding it out at arms length and
[47:47] analyzing it and talking about how it
[47:50] can't be mean it can't be right and
[47:52] that's not receiving it friends that's
[47:53] taking a gift and holding it out at arms
[47:56] length amen but he wants us to take that
[47:58] word and receive it and become one with
[48:00] it and say it's me be it unto me
[48:02] according to your
[48:05] word amen so let that seed fall into our
[48:08] hearts that we might be the bedding
[48:09] grounds of that seed into our hearts and
[48:11] let us act out this place that he has
[48:13] placed Us in in the last days let the
[48:16] seed fall in our hearts Lord let the
[48:19] word fall into my heart let there not be
[48:21] any
[48:22] unbelief like
[48:24] Abraham when he was an old man
[48:27] looked like
[48:29] impossible how are they going to do that
[48:31] how is he going to be this way he never
[48:34] considered that he just received the
[48:36] word of God and went on believing it and
[48:38] God brought it to
[48:40] pass what did Abraham do to have the
[48:43] promised
[48:44] son what did he do I mean he wasn't
[48:48] taking Vitality
[48:50] vitamins to preserve his Youth and
[48:53] posterity right he wasn't doing exercise
[48:55] to try to stay there was nothing Abraham
[48:58] himself could do to bring the promise to
[49:01] pass but God had already prophesied and
[49:03] when the prophecy went forth it can't
[49:05] return to God void but it has to
[49:07] accomplish the purpose that he sent it
[49:09] for so the only thing Abraham could do
[49:11] was keep believing through every
[49:13] Junction in life through every failure
[49:15] of his own all Abraham could do was keep
[49:19] believing listen Abraham wasn't let's
[49:22] just think it this way it wasn't a
[49:23] smooth
[49:24] sail it wasn't an easy ride amen there
[49:27] were some bumps along the way there was
[49:29] some poor choices there were some
[49:31] mistakes there were some
[49:33] missteps all along the way amen but it
[49:36] didn't change the fact that he still
[49:37] believed what God said he received the
[49:39] word and believed the word when he tried
[49:41] to act it out maybe he got it wrong
[49:43] maybe he misinterpreted or allowed
[49:45] somebody to misinterpret it but it
[49:46] didn't change the fact that he believed
[49:49] it and because he believed it
[49:52] righteousness was imputed unto him not
[49:54] because he did but because he believed
[49:58] and he did a lot of things that weren't
[50:01] right and a lot of things that were odd
[50:04] sure but he kept
[50:06] believing and that that Faith he brother
[50:09] B said he or the Bible says he staggered
[50:11] not at the promise of God that's right
[50:14] he just kept believing make a mistake
[50:16] keep believing make a misstep keep
[50:18] believing produce an ishmail keep
[50:20] believing go to Egypt keep believing get
[50:22] in conflict with lot keep believing
[50:24] separate from lot keep believing amen
[50:28] your wife gets upset keep believing
[50:29] she's sterile keep believing you become
[50:32] sterile keep
[50:34] believing just keep believing amen God
[50:36] needed beding ground he needed a place
[50:38] where his word to fall into and abide in
[50:41] that until it could come of itself and
[50:44] produce itself
[50:47] again
[50:50] amen again in the paman church age from
[50:52] the church age book he said the evidence
[50:55] of receiving the Holy Ghost today day is
[50:56] just the same as it was back in the day
[50:58] of Our Lord it is receiving the word of
[51:00] Truth for the day in which you
[51:02] live so it's receiving the word the
[51:05] truth but not the truth just any truth
[51:08] the truth for the day in which you
[51:11] live now listen carefully Jesus never
[51:15] did stress the importance of
[51:17] works as he did the
[51:19] word he knew that if the people got the
[51:22] word The Works would follow am amen that
[51:27] is the
[51:28] Bible
[51:30] amen you
[51:32] mean you mean that the message in Christ
[51:36] and the word it it was never here to
[51:38] emphasize the works but it was here to
[51:40] bring back the
[51:42] word amen yes this message was not to
[51:46] emphasize
[51:48] works it was to restore the word because
[51:52] God knows that when the people get the
[51:54] word The Works will follow
[51:57] amen that's God's plan why because the
[52:00] life is in the word to what reproduce
[52:04] itself all it needs is good ground what
[52:06] is good ground a predestinated heart
[52:08] that will receive it and believe it
[52:11] that's all he needs friends he just
[52:13] needs us to receive it as he said it and
[52:15] say that's it and just believe it and
[52:17] just let God let the seed do the work
[52:20] inside of us let the process come to
[52:23] full fruit amen and not derail it and
[52:25] not come somehow handicap it all the
[52:27] time but just let the seed do the work
[52:30] he sent it to do because it will not
[52:32] return unto him void but it will
[52:34] accomplish that which he sent it to do
[52:36] and he sent a word in this generation
[52:38] through a prophetic message amen and
[52:40] that word is doing a work in our lives
[52:43] and it will accomplish what he said it
[52:45] will do and he will have a bride without
[52:47] spot a wrinkle he will have a many
[52:49] membered bride standing here reflecting
[52:51] his glory upon this Earth in the end
[52:53] times she will be so much like him she
[52:55] will be
[52:57] amen and don't you dare ask me how I'm
[53:00] going to do it cuz I'm not going to do
[53:01] it because I can't do it any more than
[53:03] the Virgin could produce a child I can't
[53:06] do it any more than Abraham could
[53:07] produce a promised son through Sarah I
[53:09] can't do it any more than anybody else
[53:11] in the Bible could do it all I can do is
[53:14] say yay and amen that's nothing but the
[53:16] truth brother
[53:18] brandom and then the word will produce
[53:21] itself cuz the word is God it cannot
[53:25] fail
[53:27] he
[53:28] knows that the works will
[53:31] follow look at Abraham's life God speaks
[53:34] to him he believes he acts amen but he
[53:37] doesn't act completely right because
[53:39] he's supposed to go uh separate from all
[53:41] his Kindred and his family in his home
[53:42] and go to but he he takes dad along and
[53:45] he takes lot along and we know that that
[53:47] there's this belief he has but the but
[53:49] the the let's just say the performance
[53:51] of that which he believes are been told
[53:53] isn't
[53:54] perfect oh my good goodness I'm so
[53:58] thankful God wrote a Bible and told us
[54:00] the
[54:03] truth and so that's in our lives it
[54:06] hasn't always looked good we believe
[54:07] this message but when it come to
[54:08] performing it we haven't always we don't
[54:10] have a stellar track record
[54:12] friends it doesn't look clean and tidy
[54:14] and nice and neat it's a little bit
[54:16] messy but it doesn't change the fact
[54:18] that in us we believe that prophecy is
[54:19] true and somehow I believe I'm part of
[54:22] it
[54:27] and so if you follow Abraham's life his
[54:30] life is not always perfect performance
[54:33] his life is not always keeping exactly
[54:35] to the letter what the Lord said he's
[54:37] got some misinterpretations and some
[54:39] disobedient and he left the promised
[54:41] land when he shouldn't leave the
[54:42] promised land there's a little bit of
[54:43] lying and there's all kinds of different
[54:45] things
[54:48] involved but he received the word and
[54:51] God knows that if you get the word The
[54:53] Works will follow and through all of the
[54:55] bumps and bruises and ups and downs
[54:58] Abraham kept learning one
[55:00] lesson this is just brother Chad this is
[55:02] my own interpretation the one lesson
[55:04] that I think Abraham kept learning is
[55:06] just do what God
[55:07] says just do what God says just do it
[55:11] it's it was so much better just to do
[55:14] what God says
[55:17] amen and by the time he gets to the end
[55:20] of his life When God says take thine son
[55:22] thine only son Hey listen now this man's
[55:25] faith has come to Perfection now his
[55:27] character has been developed by walking
[55:29] with the Lord he knows if he gets the
[55:31] word The Works will follow and at the
[55:33] end of his life there's no questions
[55:34] they're just taking his son going to the
[55:36] mountain to slame and God was so pleased
[55:38] he said Abraham stay thy hand now that I
[55:41] I know that thou lovest me
[55:45] yeah see that wasn't Abraham's
[55:48] performance day
[55:50] one but day one he received the
[55:55] word amen forget the word The Works will
[56:00] follow in the message you must be born
[56:03] again brother benam says the the true
[56:05] word comes to the true Prophet I believe
[56:08] that true word comes to the true prophet
[56:11] he tells you the true word I believe
[56:13] that you follow the true word and you
[56:16] get a true experience of the word
[56:19] because the word is made flesh in you
[56:20] and you become God's sons and the word
[56:23] of God is revolving right out of God
[56:25] into you because you are of his nature
[56:29] his spirit is in you and you'll do the
[56:31] works of
[56:33] God why will I do the works of God
[56:35] because a true Prophet brought the true
[56:38] word and I follow the true word and I
[56:41] get a true experience of the word amen
[56:43] and now something's spinning off of God
[56:46] and dropping into my heart which is the
[56:47] spirit of God and I'm going to do the
[56:49] works of God not because I'm special and
[56:52] not because I'm able but because I got a
[56:54] true word from a true prophet amen and I
[56:56] follow the true word and I got a true
[56:58] experience of the word
[57:00] amen and that started bringing the word
[57:03] to life inside of
[57:04] me as it I love
[57:07] this and the word of God is revolving
[57:11] right out of God into
[57:13] you because you are of his nature his
[57:16] spirit is in you and you'll do the works
[57:19] of
[57:20] God
[57:22] thankful so let's turn to Matthew 13
[57:25] together
[57:33] so now we know the word of God is a
[57:36] seed God Saves by the fluences of
[57:40] preaching he saved and he sent his word
[57:43] to heal and to deliver from
[57:45] destruction God's word is a seed and has
[57:48] the power to replicate itself when it
[57:50] falls in good
[57:52] ground but now I want to once again
[57:54] review the fact that we are also a seed
[57:58] or we have a seed
[57:59] within Matthew
[58:04] 13:24 another Parable put he forth unto
[58:06] them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is
[58:08] likened unto a man which sowed good seed
[58:10] in his field but while men slept his
[58:12] enemy came and S tears among the wheat
[58:14] and went his way but when the blade was
[58:17] sprung up and brought forth fruit then
[58:18] appeared the tears also so the Servants
[58:21] of the householder came and said unto
[58:22] him sir do thou soow good seed in thy
[58:25] field from when thou have it tears he
[58:27] said unto them as the enemy hath done
[58:29] this the servant said unto him wil thou
[58:32] then that we go and gather them up but
[58:34] he said nay lest while you gather up the
[58:36] tears you root up also the wheat with
[58:38] them let both grow together until the
[58:40] Harvest and in the time of harvest I
[58:43] will say to the Reapers gather you
[58:44] together first the tears and bind them
[58:46] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[58:48] wheat into the
[58:49] barn he goes down to give the
[58:51] interpretation of this in verse 37 and
[58:54] he said he answered and he said unto
[58:55] them he that Seth The Good Seed is the
[58:57] son of man the field is the world the
[59:01] good seed are the children of the
[59:03] Kingdom but the tears are the children
[59:05] of the wicked one the enemy that sowed
[59:07] them is the devil the Harvest is the end
[59:10] of the world and the reapers are the
[59:12] Angels so when he brings the
[59:14] interpretation he tells us that he that
[59:18] Seth The Good Seed is the son of man
[59:19] that's he himself the field is the
[59:24] world and the good seed are the children
[59:26] of the
[59:27] Kingdom so in the previous Parable there
[59:31] was good ground the seed had to fall in
[59:33] and we've learned that the good ground
[59:34] is that which has been prepared
[59:36] predestinated ground that's the believer
[59:38] and only in the good ground will that
[59:40] seed bring forth of itself
[59:43] again but now the field is the world and
[59:46] the sewer is the son of man and the seed
[59:49] that he sown is the children of the
[59:50] Kingdom an enemy SED other seed this is
[59:53] going all the way back to the Garden of
[59:55] Eden an enemy sowed other seed and these
[59:57] were children of the wicked one amen but
[1:00:00] now we find out that the children of the
[1:00:02] Kingdom have been swn into the World by
[1:00:04] the son of man and when they were swn
[1:00:06] into the world it means as it went as a
[1:00:09] seed it's the same as in the Book of
[1:00:10] Genesis when the seeds were laying neath
[1:00:13] the water they already had a life inside
[1:00:16] of them God was what was God going to do
[1:00:18] God was going to change the conditioned
[1:00:20] by the spoken word to bring that seed to
[1:00:22] life and now God has once again swn seed
[1:00:26] into the world Amen and those seeds are
[1:00:28] the children of the kingdom and he's the
[1:00:30] husbandman who SED him
[1:00:32] himself so what do you think are in
[1:00:34] those
[1:00:36] seeds
[1:00:39] Amen in Genesis 1:1 we don't turn there
[1:00:41] but I'll just remind you of it he said
[1:00:44] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[1:00:46] and the Earth and the Earth was without
[1:00:47] form and void and darkness was upon the
[1:00:49] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[1:00:51] moved upon the face of the waters and
[1:00:53] God said let there be light and there
[1:00:55] was light so we find already that the
[1:00:58] holy spirit is here brooding and I want
[1:01:01] to bring to your attention amen that the
[1:01:03] holy spirit is already present and the
[1:01:05] holy spirit is already brooding but the
[1:01:07] holy spirit is not changing anything
[1:01:10] till the word Goes
[1:01:12] Forth but when the word Goes Forth it's
[1:01:14] the spirit of God bringing the word to
[1:01:17] pass so it's not amen it's it's a
[1:01:21] conjunction amen gone the holy spirit is
[1:01:24] the spirit of the word to bring the word
[1:01:25] to to life the holy spirit's already
[1:01:27] there but it needs God's spoken word and
[1:01:30] when God speaks it word it goes into
[1:01:32] action as the agent to bring that word
[1:01:33] to pass and begins to move things into
[1:01:36] place and position around the world but
[1:01:38] the Holy Ghost wasn't just because it
[1:01:40] was there it was already there doesn't
[1:01:43] mean it can start repositioning things
[1:01:45] it has to position it according to the
[1:01:47] word and the word has to be spoken in
[1:01:49] due
[1:01:52] season amen the the the the point in all
[1:01:55] of this friends is that we can say we
[1:01:57] want the spirit we want the spirit we
[1:01:59] want the spirit and that's what we need
[1:02:00] we need the spirit to make the word live
[1:02:02] amen but the spirit of God can be
[1:02:04] present but the spirit of God is here to
[1:02:06] make the word live we still need the
[1:02:08] spoken word amen we needed a prophet to
[1:02:11] come in this age and bring the word and
[1:02:13] another thing that f i find absolutely
[1:02:15] amazing in what brother Ma's getting
[1:02:17] ready to tell us I'm going to read
[1:02:18] several quotes but what I find amazing
[1:02:20] is that Holy Ghost was
[1:02:22] bound in this generation bound the very
[1:02:25] spirit of God the very Holy Ghost was
[1:02:27] bound it was bound by these
[1:02:29] denominational Rivers for nearly 2,000
[1:02:31] years but is going to be loosed in the
[1:02:32] evening time why by the evening time
[1:02:35] message and where's the Holy Ghost going
[1:02:36] to go back in the people of again what
[1:02:38] bound the Holy Ghost the limitation of
[1:02:41] the word bound the Holy Ghost so the
[1:02:43] Holy Ghost and the word are linked
[1:02:45] together they work together amen they're
[1:02:47] part of the same thing they're part of
[1:02:49] the same person they're expressions of
[1:02:51] the same being which is God
[1:02:54] almighty so we can say I just want the
[1:02:57] spirit I just want the spirit I want the
[1:02:58] spirit God is sending the spirit but God
[1:03:01] is sending the word and those two go
[1:03:06] together
[1:03:09] amen that's why all the Holy Ghost moves
[1:03:12] in the Pentecostal movement that I grew
[1:03:14] up
[1:03:15] in it amounted to enthusiasm and
[1:03:19] excitement but where was the
[1:03:22] word where were lives changed yeah where
[1:03:26] was a bride made manifest God had to
[1:03:28] send his
[1:03:29] word amen
[1:03:33] amen in the message it is the rising of
[1:03:35] the sun he said fear not for I am he
[1:03:37] that was dead and is alive again forever
[1:03:39] more and I have the keys to death and
[1:03:41] hell I've already conquered it don't
[1:03:43] fear anymore for every for ordained
[1:03:45] predestinated seat of God shall come to
[1:03:47] life when the light spreads across the
[1:03:50] Earth of the Glorious gospel in every
[1:03:53] age it'll bring forth the crop that God
[1:03:55] ordained it to do he had he had raised
[1:03:58] from the dead so now he's saying that
[1:04:01] this this he he's typing this also with
[1:04:04] Genesis now there was seeds that were
[1:04:06] laying there they were under the water
[1:04:08] there was no light there but there was
[1:04:10] already light brother Ben said they were
[1:04:12] germinated
[1:04:14] seeds they already life in them but they
[1:04:16] were waiting for a condition something
[1:04:18] had to Spring them in the manifestation
[1:04:20] Quicken them to life amen they're laying
[1:04:21] there dormant they're waiting and now
[1:04:23] God would begin to speak and as he would
[1:04:25] speak the Holy Ghost and that would move
[1:04:27] amen and move that word into position
[1:04:29] and he said let there be light there was
[1:04:30] light then the firmament would move away
[1:04:32] and the waters would roll away and dry
[1:04:34] land would appear and as everything
[1:04:36] started coming into position according
[1:04:38] to the harmony of God's word all of a
[1:04:40] sudden he said now let the seed bring
[1:04:42] forth of its kind and all of a sudden
[1:04:44] that seed that was laying there that was
[1:04:46] a palm seed had Palm life in it was
[1:04:48] germinated long ago all of a sudden when
[1:04:51] the condition was right by the spoken
[1:04:53] word of God moved upon by the spirit of
[1:04:55] God all of a sudden a palm tree
[1:04:59] emerged cuz it was already
[1:05:01] there it was all already there it needed
[1:05:06] the word of God to recondition the
[1:05:09] atmosphere it needed the spirit of God
[1:05:11] to bring the right atmosphere according
[1:05:13] to the word of
[1:05:14] God and then what is it comes up a palm
[1:05:19] tree why is it a palm tree that comes up
[1:05:22] because it was a palm life that was
[1:05:23] embedded in it
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:33] amen he says the predestined seat of God
[1:05:36] shall come to life when the light
[1:05:38] spreads across the Earth of the Glorious
[1:05:40] gospel in every age it'll bring forth
[1:05:44] the crop that God ordained it to there's
[1:05:47] a crop laying there but it needs the
[1:05:49] light but it needs the light of its
[1:05:52] age and God sent a light in this day
[1:05:56] what is this light to do is to bring the
[1:05:59] life of the seed
[1:06:02] out God's power to transforming said God
[1:06:05] through a seed of his word and there's
[1:06:06] only one thing that can Quicken the word
[1:06:08] and that's the spirit for it's the
[1:06:10] lifegiver to the word and when the life
[1:06:13] in the word meets the life of the spirit
[1:06:15] it produces whatever the seed is doesn't
[1:06:18] change what it is it produces what it
[1:06:21] is so when the life in the word means
[1:06:24] the life of the spirit it produces
[1:06:26] whatever the seed
[1:06:28] is so again in in same message and now
[1:06:34] what is the transformation how do we get
[1:06:36] it what does the transformation God does
[1:06:39] it by the spirit of his word he
[1:06:41] transform he plants his seed throws his
[1:06:44] Spirit on it and it brings forth the
[1:06:46] product his holy spirit transforms the
[1:06:49] seed word in to be Vindication of its
[1:06:52] kind what kind of seed you are that
[1:06:56] shows just what's in you you can't hide
[1:06:59] it whatever you are inside it shows
[1:07:03] outside this is what happened when Jesus
[1:07:06] Christ was standing there as that bright
[1:07:07] shining light whatever seeds were inside
[1:07:09] was starting to show on the outside
[1:07:12] doesn't matter if you're wearing broad
[1:07:13] Flores and you're wearing a robe and you
[1:07:15] have a priest garment on what you were
[1:07:17] inside was starting to show when this
[1:07:18] light was
[1:07:20] shining when the fullness of the word
[1:07:22] was present it was bringing out what was
[1:07:24] in the seed
[1:07:26] you can't hide it whatever you are
[1:07:28] inside it shows outside you just can't
[1:07:30] keep from it you can't make the tree
[1:07:33] anything but what it is it's going to be
[1:07:35] that way the Holy Spirit transforms the
[1:07:38] seeds that's on the inside of it no
[1:07:40] matter what kind of seed it is it'll
[1:07:42] transform it amen it'll bring it from
[1:07:45] dormant laying there lifeless shrouded
[1:07:47] in darkness it'll bring it into a full
[1:07:48] manifestation because the life is
[1:07:50] already
[1:07:52] there in the fourth seal the prophet
[1:07:55] makes this
[1:07:56] statement the word itself is
[1:07:59] spirit it's spirit in word
[1:08:02] form I think it's amazing and I'm just
[1:08:04] going to share this with you I don't
[1:08:05] have a solution to all of these
[1:08:07] statements so don't look at me to
[1:08:08] explain everything tidy I can't but
[1:08:11] sometimes brother B said the seed's
[1:08:12] laying there and it takes the spirit to
[1:08:13] bring it life but then he said the the
[1:08:16] the the spirit is the word he says it
[1:08:18] this way the word itself is spirit it's
[1:08:21] spirit in word
[1:08:22] form so where do you get the spirit
[1:08:26] from the word or from somewhere else to
[1:08:29] make the word
[1:08:30] live I think we start over complicating
[1:08:33] things I think we start making it
[1:08:35] difficult CU he told us in the
[1:08:37] scriptures that there are three that
[1:08:39] bear record in heaven the Father the
[1:08:41] word and the spirit and these three are
[1:08:44] one amen the true word carries with it
[1:08:47] the true spirit amen they come together
[1:08:49] amen there's a spirit of God that will
[1:08:51] make the word of God live amen I can't
[1:08:54] tell you whether amen you have to get
[1:08:56] the word first and then the spirit comes
[1:08:57] upon the word and makes it live or you
[1:08:59] get the word when it's preached in the
[1:09:01] spirit of the word and the spirit of the
[1:09:03] word I can't tell you how the mechanics
[1:09:05] of it all I'm just going to tell you
[1:09:07] that you can't separate these things too
[1:09:09] far from one another that if you want
[1:09:11] the spirit you need the word amen if you
[1:09:13] want the spirit life inside of you you
[1:09:14] need to get the word if you want the
[1:09:17] word to live you need the spirit of the
[1:09:19] word to make it live so don't ask me how
[1:09:22] to mechanically break that down I can't
[1:09:24] break it down for you cuz brother Brom
[1:09:25] says it both ways and I can't make it
[1:09:27] neat and tidy but what I can tell you is
[1:09:29] this word that been given to us in this
[1:09:31] day has transforming power life inside
[1:09:33] of it life to bring the life in you to
[1:09:36] fruition life to bring the word that's
[1:09:38] preached to
[1:09:39] manifestation so is it the word that
[1:09:41] comes to me or the word that's in me
[1:09:43] it's both friends it's the word that's
[1:09:45] in you that was planted before the
[1:09:46] foundation world it's also the word
[1:09:48] that's coming to you to manifest itself
[1:09:50] in
[1:09:51] you so where does the manifested life
[1:09:54] come from does it come from the nature
[1:09:56] of God trapped inside the SE Gene of God
[1:09:58] or does it come from the word that's
[1:09:59] being preached to me as it manifests
[1:10:01] itself I'm just going to say both you
[1:10:03] need both you must have both you have to
[1:10:06] have a seed and good
[1:10:08] ground
[1:10:11] amen I know this it doesn't matter how
[1:10:13] much seed's inside of you amen you can
[1:10:16] ask for Holy Ghost to be poured on you
[1:10:18] all the time but without the preaching
[1:10:19] of the word there's not going to be a
[1:10:20] manifestation of the life of the word it
[1:10:23] takes both amen it takes the word and
[1:10:26] the spirit it takes the life inside of
[1:10:28] you and the Life coming to you right
[1:10:34] amen so let's not over complicate it
[1:10:37] let's just say God fill me with your
[1:10:38] word but no I want to be filled with the
[1:10:40] spirit okay fill me with your spirit
[1:10:42] how's he going to fill you with the
[1:10:43] spirit probably going to send you his
[1:10:47] word I I don't want to complicate this I
[1:10:51] just want to say this word that you've
[1:10:53] given me will do what you sent it to do
[1:10:55] amen whatever you planted inside of me
[1:10:57] before the foundation of the world by
[1:10:58] predestination it's going to do what you
[1:11:00] ordained it to do this word whether in
[1:11:02] me or coming to me is not going to
[1:11:04] return to you void but it'll accomplish
[1:11:06] what you sent it out to
[1:11:09] do I think sometimes in the past I I
[1:11:13] felt that I had to take one side or the
[1:11:15] other to explain it tidy one way or the
[1:11:17] other and in so doing we leave out
[1:11:21] truths I don't know how to explain it
[1:11:23] it's spiritual
[1:11:25] and my mind is just stuck in
[1:11:29] carnality but by the grace of God my
[1:11:32] soul is free to say
[1:11:34] Amen brother Brenham says the only thing
[1:11:38] that can make the word live is the
[1:11:39] spirit amen then he says the word itself
[1:11:42] is spirit
[1:11:46] amen so what makes what live I don't
[1:11:49] know it's just
[1:11:52] amen the word itself is spirit it's
[1:11:55] spirit in word
[1:11:57] form and then you see when it's
[1:11:59] quickened or brought to life the spirit
[1:12:01] of the word goes to work and acts praise
[1:12:06] God he didn't say you go to work and act
[1:12:08] the spirit goes to work and
[1:12:10] acts if you get the word The Works will
[1:12:15] follow we if we find ourselves living a
[1:12:18] mediocre life and we live below our
[1:12:20] privileges we're not happy with the way
[1:12:22] we're
[1:12:23] living well we don't really need is uh a
[1:12:26] a beat myself up
[1:12:28] session I mean if you're wrong just
[1:12:30] admit you're wrong like that's that's
[1:12:33] that should be step number one and we
[1:12:35] don't make excuses we just say you know
[1:12:37] what I'm doing a really lousy job of
[1:12:39] being a Believer right now no excuses
[1:12:42] but also not a self-pity party and say
[1:12:45] maybe I'm not one of them I'll never be
[1:12:46] them I'm never going they're all passing
[1:12:47] me out just stop that just stop it now
[1:12:51] cuz what we're doing is defeating
[1:12:52] ourselves we're never getting off the
[1:12:54] ground because we're tearing ourselves
[1:12:56] down we don't even need the devil to do
[1:12:59] it what we need to do is just be honest
[1:13:01] with ourselves but if I want to do the
[1:13:03] works I need to get the word I need to
[1:13:05] put my focus not on myself but I need to
[1:13:08] put a focus on this word that God sent
[1:13:10] and I need to say Lord let that be unto
[1:13:12] me too you said you'll take care of
[1:13:14] temper let that be unto me you say stop
[1:13:16] it let that be unto me Lord you say
[1:13:18] we're going to have your very
[1:13:19] manifestation let that be unto me too
[1:13:22] Lord I need it in my life
[1:13:26] amen listen no matter how much you hear
[1:13:28] it you're never going to attain to it of
[1:13:31] your own
[1:13:33] effort just just hearing it as a
[1:13:36] instruction in the ways of righteousness
[1:13:39] as though it's an intellectual speech
[1:13:41] and the way to be a a bride
[1:13:43] member so lesson one let's talk about
[1:13:46] the way you
[1:13:48] dress this has got to be long and that
[1:13:50] has to be covered and this has to be
[1:13:52] loose fitting and all of that's true
[1:13:56] but if you look at it as a way to attain
[1:13:58] to The Works you're going to be so
[1:14:03] disappointed instead of looking at it
[1:14:05] and say that's the truth yeah that's the
[1:14:08] way a daughter of God should
[1:14:11] dress that I believe it Lord be it unto
[1:14:14] me according to what the prophet
[1:14:17] taught and when the spirit of that word
[1:14:19] comes to life inside of you guess what
[1:14:21] you're going to want to do amen
[1:14:25] yes
[1:14:26] right doesn't mean we don't preach about
[1:14:29] these things brother B If You Don't
[1:14:30] Preach If You Don't Preach clothesline
[1:14:32] you're not preaching the gospel because
[1:14:34] we got to hear the truth so that we can
[1:14:35] recognize we're
[1:14:37] wrong so that the truth can set us free
[1:14:40] from misconceptions from wrong ideas
[1:14:42] from our own selfishness and our own
[1:14:45] Pride we need to hear the word we need
[1:14:47] to hear it straight we need to hear it
[1:14:49] true but we don't need to hear it as a
[1:14:52] as a measuring stick that somehow I must
[1:14:54] attain to to be Bri right we just need
[1:14:55] to hear it as the reality this is not
[1:14:57] what's pleasing to God I need that to be
[1:15:00] alive inside of
[1:15:02] me and let the word take root and good
[1:15:06] ground it says it's true God it's true
[1:15:10] now make it live inside of
[1:15:15] me another statement brother man comes
[1:15:18] to Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:15:19] he said the word only has
[1:15:22] life any other word is a hybrid no no
[1:15:25] matter how much it looks like it it
[1:15:26] isn't the word the word produces its own
[1:15:30] life praise be to God so if I receive
[1:15:33] the word the word will produce its own
[1:15:35] life I don't have to manufacture
[1:15:38] anything all I have to do is
[1:15:42] receive Abraham manufactured nothing Eve
[1:15:45] or uh uh Mary manufactured nothing what
[1:15:48] did they do they receive the word and it
[1:15:52] produced
[1:15:53] itself and the message it is rising of
[1:15:55] the sun he says this real Eagle
[1:15:58] recognizes the call of God's word why
[1:16:00] he's an
[1:16:02] eagle a eagle to a eagle remember
[1:16:05] brother benham's story this is what he's
[1:16:07] referring to the chick the the eagle in
[1:16:09] the chicken yard the farmer took the egg
[1:16:11] and we all know it so well set it under
[1:16:13] a hen and it hatched out and it tried to
[1:16:15] live like the chickens but it was
[1:16:17] different in nature than the chickens
[1:16:18] and one day his his mama comes flying
[1:16:21] over and screams and when he hears the
[1:16:23] scream something inside of him resonates
[1:16:25] with that scream and and he knows
[1:16:27] whatever that is I am down on the inside
[1:16:30] and brother bram's trying to he's trying
[1:16:31] to show us amen how a God is calling out
[1:16:34] of the denominations his children this
[1:16:37] is what the analogy is this is what the
[1:16:39] parable is trying to tell us but he he's
[1:16:42] telling us that the reason the eagle
[1:16:44] could respond to the eagle scream is
[1:16:46] because it was already an
[1:16:49] eagle he wasn't trying to become an
[1:16:52] eagle he was an eagle
[1:16:57] so he wasn't trying to change from
[1:16:59] chicken to Eagle in his mind he was a
[1:17:02] chicken but in nature he was an eagle he
[1:17:05] was trying to overcome his
[1:17:07] mindset right not his
[1:17:10] genetics amen so because his mind was
[1:17:14] chicken when Mama Said fly he said I
[1:17:18] can't right how I don't know how and she
[1:17:22] says you're already an eagle just jump
[1:17:25] and flap your wings you already know how
[1:17:28] on the inside the life is there flying
[1:17:30] is already in you you just have a
[1:17:32] chicken
[1:17:34] mind cuz you you come to the world
[1:17:36] alienated your mind is darkened to the
[1:17:38] things of God you have spiritual Amnesia
[1:17:41] but you were a Son of God before the
[1:17:42] foundation of the world you're still a
[1:17:44] Son of God you'll always be a Son of God
[1:17:46] but the eagle scream come to wake you up
[1:17:49] out of the stuper thinking that you're
[1:17:51] just a chicken you're not a chicken look
[1:17:53] around look at what you hunger for for
[1:17:55] look at what you like look at what you
[1:17:56] don't like look at how you don't fit in
[1:17:59] you're not a chicken you're an
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:03] eagle and he realized listen Mama didn't
[1:18:06] have to come
[1:18:09] down and do demonstrations on flying all
[1:18:12] Mama had to do is encourage him to get
[1:18:13] out of chicken
[1:18:15] mentality cuz it was already in
[1:18:18] him this is the story brother Bam's
[1:18:20] telling it was an eagle to an eagle the
[1:18:24] chicken ran and
[1:18:25] hid but it was because he's an eagle
[1:18:28] he's responding to the eagle
[1:18:30] scream why is it you and I respond to
[1:18:32] this
[1:18:33] message because there's message already
[1:18:36] down on the inside
[1:18:38] friends it's a call to the children of
[1:18:40] God there's a child of God already down
[1:18:42] on the inside that's why we respond the
[1:18:45] problem our struggle is we've been
[1:18:47] raised in a chicken yard grounded for so
[1:18:49] long thinking that we're chickens we're
[1:18:51] not chickens we're sons of God
[1:18:55] yeah and the word of God is here to
[1:18:58] awaken the reality on the inside of us
[1:19:00] Amen to bring another truth another
[1:19:02] reality so that we can say you know when
[1:19:05] when that little Eagle began to flap its
[1:19:07] wings and jump and got up on the up on
[1:19:09] the post of the fence you know what he
[1:19:11] did he accepted what his mama had said
[1:19:14] he just said be unto me according to
[1:19:16] what mama said and started flapping his
[1:19:18] wings he hadn't done it before he didn't
[1:19:20] go to school for it he didn't have
[1:19:21] intellectual teaching on it it was
[1:19:23] already in him and it was already in you
[1:19:25] and I to believe this message from the
[1:19:27] first time we heard it we were just
[1:19:29] stuck in chicken
[1:19:32] thinking that's why when everybody else
[1:19:33] ran away we were like uh I should run
[1:19:37] with them but I kind of like what that
[1:19:39] sounds
[1:19:42] like like everything in my experience is
[1:19:44] telling me to follow the chicken but
[1:19:46] something else down inside is saying
[1:19:48] look up I mean let's it won't hurt the
[1:19:52] look when others wouldn't touch the
[1:19:55] books because they're poison amen
[1:19:57] something in you there was a curiosity
[1:19:59] that said well it won't hurt me to read
[1:20:00] just
[1:20:01] one it won't hurt to listen to this tape
[1:20:04] it won't hurt what was that friends it
[1:20:06] was an eagle to an eagle it was not an
[1:20:09] eagle to a chicken telling you to become
[1:20:11] an eagle it was an eagle to an
[1:20:14] eagle here he is in Rising in the sun he
[1:20:17] said it's an eagle to an eagle the word
[1:20:19] before the foundation of the world the
[1:20:21] word to the
[1:20:22] word pay close attention
[1:20:25] the word predestinated that's you and I
[1:20:28] to the word written for the hour that's
[1:20:30] the message of the hour what was calling
[1:20:33] the word written for the hour was
[1:20:35] calling to the word predestinated what
[1:20:36] was it Eagle to Eagle or brother B says
[1:20:39] word to
[1:20:41] word word to word yeah so where's the
[1:20:46] word where's the word yeah it's on both
[1:20:50] sides it's the word being preached but
[1:20:52] it's also the word on the inside and the
[1:20:54] Soul it's the part that's believing the
[1:20:58] word the word predestinated to the word
[1:21:02] written for the
[1:21:03] hour praise God let's turn to John 4
[1:21:14] quickly John chapter
[1:21:17] 4 we know this story is the woman at the
[1:21:20] well the Samaritan woman that Jesus had
[1:21:22] needs to go by Samaria because why CU
[1:21:25] she was predestinated to
[1:21:30] life it's amazing that she was
[1:21:33] predestinated to
[1:21:35] life but yet she had to hear the
[1:21:39] message because it takes the word to
[1:21:42] bring the seed to life
[1:21:45] amen and so he had to go by to wake her
[1:21:49] up in John chapter 4 he begins a
[1:21:52] dialogue with her and talk to her and
[1:21:54] reveal her husbands and all of this but
[1:21:56] I'm going to pick it up in verse
[1:21:58] 19 and the woman saith un him sir I
[1:22:00] perceive that thou art a prophet our
[1:22:02] fathers worshiped in this mountain and
[1:22:03] you say that in Jerusalem is the place
[1:22:05] where men ought to
[1:22:06] worship Jesus said unto her woman
[1:22:09] believe me now I want to stop at verse
[1:22:11] 19 for a minute because this woman has a
[1:22:14] bad reputation five husbands she's
[1:22:16] living with the six she can't come to
[1:22:17] the well at the respectable time of day
[1:22:19] when the respectable women come her life
[1:22:22] is shrouded in darkness but what's in
[1:22:25] her
[1:22:26] heart when she comes in contact with
[1:22:28] somebody that can tell her her life and
[1:22:30] tell her that there's water of living uh
[1:22:32] everlasting life tell her that she's had
[1:22:34] five husbands the one she's in with now
[1:22:36] what does she want to know she wants to
[1:22:37] know how can I worship God what's the
[1:22:40] right way I'm confused with all this
[1:22:43] religion right the Jews say this the
[1:22:45] Baptist say this the Methodist say this
[1:22:47] the Catholic I'm confused about all of
[1:22:49] this but something inside of me though
[1:22:52] in a harlot condition though coming to
[1:22:54] the the wrong time of day there's
[1:22:56] something in me that wants to know how
[1:22:57] does God want to be
[1:23:00] worshiped and Jesus said unto her woman
[1:23:03] believe me the hour cometh when you
[1:23:05] shall neither in this mountain nor yet
[1:23:07] at Jerusalem worship the
[1:23:09] father ye worship you know not what you
[1:23:11] know we know what we worship for the
[1:23:13] Salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[1:23:15] cometh and now is when the true
[1:23:17] worshipper shall worship the father in
[1:23:19] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:23:22] seeketh such to worship Him God is a
[1:23:25] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:23:26] worship Him in spirit and in truth the
[1:23:30] woman saith unto him I know that Messiah
[1:23:32] cometh when which is called Christ when
[1:23:34] he has come he will tell us all things
[1:23:36] Jesus said unto her I that speak unto
[1:23:38] thee am
[1:23:40] he we know that the woman then leaves
[1:23:44] her water pot and goes runs into the
[1:23:46] City and begins to tell them she knows
[1:23:49] the
[1:23:50] truth she knows where to worship she
[1:23:52] knows how to worship and Jesus was given
[1:23:54] giving a dispensational change he was
[1:23:56] telling her now's coming the time that
[1:23:58] you're not going to worship in a
[1:23:59] building you're not going to worship
[1:24:01] through a denomination you're not going
[1:24:02] to worship through a Creed you're not
[1:24:03] going to worship in Jerusalem and you're
[1:24:05] not going to worship here in Samaria but
[1:24:07] you're going to worship in spirit and in
[1:24:10] truth and something in her liked
[1:24:13] it something in her resonated that that
[1:24:16] was true and the woman ran into the City
[1:24:20] and brother benam says I don't have the
[1:24:22] quote but I was just reading it today
[1:24:23] brother brandom said when she comes
[1:24:25] running into the City and begins to tell
[1:24:27] them they knew her before now they know
[1:24:30] she was changed she had been transformed
[1:24:33] what transformed her what was the what
[1:24:35] was it was it a week away was it a
[1:24:38] self-help book what what was it
[1:24:39] counseling it was it was immediately
[1:24:42] when she came in contact with the truth
[1:24:44] something inside her sprung to life and
[1:24:46] she was changed because she was no
[1:24:47] longer believing she was a chicken she
[1:24:49] was recognizing who she really was and
[1:24:53] it changed her yeah just hearing the
[1:24:56] truth changed
[1:25:00] her in testimony in the sea the prophet
[1:25:02] says notice the woman she wasn't dead
[1:25:05] she she caught it quickly she was a seed
[1:25:09] predestinated to eternal life and as
[1:25:11] soon as that flashed over her quickly
[1:25:13] she caught it yes she knew she says sir
[1:25:16] we know when the Messiah cometh he will
[1:25:18] tell us these things who art
[1:25:21] thou why was she attracted to the word
[1:25:24] why wasn't she believed the word what
[1:25:26] was going on Amen listen it wasn't
[1:25:29] Jesus's ability to clearly explain
[1:25:31] anything cuz he didn't clearly explain
[1:25:34] nothing she asked questions he didn't
[1:25:36] explain
[1:25:37] it but she came in contact with the
[1:25:40] living word for her day and when that
[1:25:43] living word for her day the person of
[1:25:45] the word the life of the word the word
[1:25:47] itself the prophecy fulfilled when she
[1:25:49] came in contact with that it quickened
[1:25:51] something inside of
[1:25:52] her because she she was a seed a
[1:25:56] predestinate to eternal
[1:25:58] life in another message brother R said
[1:26:00] look at that little woman she had fallen
[1:26:03] from God's thought
[1:26:06] yes she had fallen from God's thought
[1:26:10] what does that make her part of God Amen
[1:26:14] falling from God's thought what is a
[1:26:15] word a thought expressed she was part of
[1:26:17] the word predestinated to be part of the
[1:26:19] word she had fallen from God's thought
[1:26:21] she could be redeemed she was a subject
[1:26:24] she had representation in heaven that's
[1:26:27] why he came to her that's why he spoke
[1:26:29] the word to her that's why she responded
[1:26:31] to the word and that's why she was
[1:26:34] changed by the power of the word for her
[1:26:37] day it awakened the seed inside of
[1:26:41] her see it wasn't just the word spoken
[1:26:44] because Jesus was speaking truth all
[1:26:46] over the place
[1:26:48] are it was that when the truth was
[1:26:51] spoken there was something there that
[1:26:53] could be quickened by the truth TR that
[1:26:54] was
[1:26:55] spoken the word to the
[1:27:02] word and the message The God Who is rich
[1:27:06] in Mercy says many of you can fellowship
[1:27:08] with me on this thought when you was a
[1:27:09] little boy or little girl you would walk
[1:27:11] around there would be a certain things
[1:27:13] that would just when it wouldn't bother
[1:27:14] the other kids it seemed like there was
[1:27:16] something in you that cried out there
[1:27:18] was God somewhere yet you were a sinner
[1:27:21] you remember that and certainly now what
[1:27:23] was that
[1:27:24] that was that little form of life in you
[1:27:26] then what was that little form of life
[1:27:28] it was the
[1:27:29] word it was God it was eternal life is
[1:27:34] that what the message tells
[1:27:35] us it was in you then and then after a
[1:27:39] while you heard the gospel maybe you
[1:27:40] went to church you picked out this and
[1:27:42] that and went from denomination to
[1:27:43] denomination but one day you being part
[1:27:46] of God you had to be part of the word
[1:27:49] and when you heard the word you know
[1:27:51] where you came from you know what was
[1:27:54] the truth you were always the seed was
[1:27:58] in you always the word seen the word
[1:28:01] that was in
[1:28:05] you where is the
[1:28:08] word oh is it in the message yes is it
[1:28:11] in you yes the word seen the word that
[1:28:15] was in you that was before the
[1:28:16] foundation of the world saw the word and
[1:28:18] you came to it why did you see the word
[1:28:21] because you were part of the word you
[1:28:23] were a thought that had fallen from the
[1:28:25] mind of
[1:28:27] God part of God predestinated to be part
[1:28:30] of the Manifest word for your day so the
[1:28:32] word was in you with life inside of it
[1:28:34] the seed was a germinated seed it was
[1:28:37] there with eternal life already embedded
[1:28:39] in it but it needed to come in contact
[1:28:41] with another part of itself now do you
[1:28:44] understand the whole idea between the
[1:28:45] Chinese Laundry ticket it takes two
[1:28:47] parts of the same thing Eagle to Eagle
[1:28:49] word to word Spirit to Spirit life to
[1:28:52] life and when those two come back
[1:28:54] together that's Redemption we're coming
[1:28:56] back home amen
[1:28:58] Hall
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:01] Amen brother B said in things that are
[1:29:04] to be here in he's in the last few days
[1:29:06] of his life here on Earth here in uh
[1:29:09] December of 1965 and he begins to keep
[1:29:12] breaking these principles down as we get
[1:29:14] to the end of his ministry in 65 he
[1:29:17] starts to really hone in on this seed
[1:29:19] Gene and what really is and what a
[1:29:21] Believer really genuinely is and and
[1:29:24] listen he exposes it and he Nails it and
[1:29:26] this is right at the end of his ministry
[1:29:27] and he's trying to bring us to
[1:29:29] understand that we are part of God we
[1:29:31] were predestined before the foundation
[1:29:33] of the world Amen and and and can no
[1:29:35] more be lost than God can be
[1:29:38] lost that God's redeeming us and calling
[1:29:40] us back
[1:29:42] home and he
[1:29:44] says you say I got the baptism of the
[1:29:46] holy spirit that still has nothing to do
[1:29:49] with
[1:29:50] it that's just only a temporal gift for
[1:29:53] you the real gift is your soul down in
[1:29:56] there see that was born of God and that
[1:29:59] controls the whole thing to the word of
[1:30:01] God and the will of God brother B
[1:30:03] starting to say something he's going to
[1:30:04] say something here two days later and
[1:30:06] I'm going to read it to you about the
[1:30:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost but he's
[1:30:09] trying to move the Pentecostal idea away
[1:30:12] from this this sensationalism and this
[1:30:14] emotionalism and this something and he's
[1:30:16] trying to show us what the real gift
[1:30:18] actually is what makes us Sons and
[1:30:20] Daughters of God Amen is not some
[1:30:22] outward manifestation but what makes us
[1:30:24] Sons and Daughters of God is a seed Gene
[1:30:26] of God on the inside and that's the only
[1:30:28] thing that makes us Sons and Daughters
[1:30:29] of
[1:30:30] God
[1:30:32] Amen in the message leadership December
[1:30:35] 7th things that are to be we just read
[1:30:37] was December 5th leadership the choice
[1:30:39] of your conduct you you can't mix it now
[1:30:41] you're either for God or against God and
[1:30:43] the outward expresses shows exactly
[1:30:45] what's on the
[1:30:46] inside the CER where many of you think I
[1:30:49] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:30:51] going to heaven that don't mean one
[1:30:53] thing that you're going to
[1:30:55] heaven no sir you can have the baptism
[1:30:58] of the Holy Ghost every hour in your
[1:31:00] life and still be lost and go to
[1:31:04] hell see there's something more
[1:31:06] important than manifestations there's
[1:31:08] something more important than
[1:31:09] experiences there's something more
[1:31:10] important sensation and it's not that
[1:31:11] those are not important but if you have
[1:31:13] all of that and don't have a c Gene of
[1:31:16] God you're not going
[1:31:19] anywhere no sir you can have the baptism
[1:31:22] of the Holy Ghost every hour in your
[1:31:23] life and still be be lost and go to hell
[1:31:25] the Bible says so that's exactly right
[1:31:27] look here you are an outside person you
[1:31:29] have five senses that contact the
[1:31:31] outside body God gave you five senses
[1:31:33] not to contact him your Earthly home see
[1:31:36] taste feel smell and hear then you have
[1:31:38] a spirit on the inside of that and has
[1:31:40] five Outlets conscience and love and so
[1:31:42] forth five outlets and you contact the
[1:31:44] spirit world with that but with your
[1:31:46] spirit your physical contacts to
[1:31:49] physical your spiritual contacts to
[1:31:51] spiritual but inside of that you've got
[1:31:54] a soul and that soul is that Gene that
[1:31:57] come from
[1:31:59] God Hey listen we what we need is we
[1:32:04] need that se Gene to come to
[1:32:06] life what wakes it up the eagle
[1:32:13] scream man what what calls it to come
[1:32:16] forth the message of the
[1:32:19] hour what changed the woman at the well
[1:32:22] she had a seed she needed to come in
[1:32:24] contact with the word for her day the
[1:32:26] word for her day woke her up to the fact
[1:32:28] that she was a child of
[1:32:30] God what do we need we need the word
[1:32:32] because the word itself is spirit Spirit
[1:32:34] in word
[1:32:35] form do you need the spirit absolutely
[1:32:38] it's the holy spirit that makes the word
[1:32:40] live I need the spirit but I need the
[1:32:44] word which do I need
[1:32:48] more let's just say
[1:32:51] both that's how God gives us life is by
[1:32:54] his word his word itself has life in it
[1:32:58] he brings his life to bring to life his
[1:33:00] word he brings his word to bring his
[1:33:03] life I don't know how to separate that
[1:33:05] all I know how to do is receive
[1:33:09] it man brother Brenham is in an argument
[1:33:12] I just want to close with this thought
[1:33:14] brother Brenham is not in an argument
[1:33:15] but a discussion with a Catholic priest
[1:33:18] and when brother R says this I I I hear
[1:33:20] him say this all the time and it really
[1:33:21] made me sit and Ponder because the
[1:33:24] Catholic priest was saying God is in his
[1:33:26] church and brother benam says God's not
[1:33:28] in his church God is in his
[1:33:30] word but then at the end of the ministry
[1:33:32] brother Brenham saying God is in the
[1:33:34] bride which is his church so I'm are
[1:33:37] thinking well is God in his church or is
[1:33:39] he not in his church like he's telling
[1:33:40] the Catholic Church priest I disagree
[1:33:42] with you God's not in his church God's
[1:33:43] in his word but it seems like he's
[1:33:46] telling us God is in his church has
[1:33:48] anybody else ever had that question not
[1:33:50] just me I begin to look at this and what
[1:33:53] brother Brenham he Nails it down because
[1:33:55] you always have to understand take what
[1:33:57] brother Brenham says in context of who
[1:33:59] the audience he's speaking to he's
[1:34:01] speaking to a Catholic priest and a
[1:34:03] Catholic priest is all the Catholic
[1:34:04] church has already uh uh uh uh dismissed
[1:34:08] the Bible and the word of God as an
[1:34:10] absolute they become an absolute
[1:34:11] themselves and the pope and the church
[1:34:13] can change the word anytime they want
[1:34:16] because they believe that they're the
[1:34:17] mouthpiece of God the voice of God the
[1:34:19] representative the Vicor of Christ they
[1:34:21] can stand on Earth and speak for God and
[1:34:23] they can add to and take away and they
[1:34:25] believe that God is in his church and
[1:34:27] because God is in the church now the
[1:34:29] church can make the word whatever they
[1:34:31] want the word to be that's what brother
[1:34:33] brenham's resisting that's the idea
[1:34:36] that's the concept that's what he's
[1:34:37] saying when he said God's not in his
[1:34:38] church he's in his word amen amen
[1:34:41] because God in the beginning was the
[1:34:43] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:34:44] Word was God and God brother B said God
[1:34:46] is the word amen and Jesus Christ is the
[1:34:48] word made manifest amen the anointed
[1:34:50] word amen and and the and the word is
[1:34:53] the spirit and word
[1:34:56] form so we come back to God is in this
[1:35:00] word and here's the statement that he
[1:35:02] makes in the God of this evil age as as
[1:35:06] he's as he's disagreeing with the priest
[1:35:08] said I said God is in his word and if
[1:35:11] the I said God is in the word and if the
[1:35:12] church is contrary to the word then
[1:35:14] don't believe the
[1:35:16] church but then he comes in the church
[1:35:19] age book in the paman church age when
[1:35:21] the same section pick up your pen and
[1:35:23] write that Angel Lord told him to pick
[1:35:24] up a pen his right he says I'm just
[1:35:28] going to read just a little excerpt of
[1:35:29] it he says he shows her his Word of Life
[1:35:32] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:35:35] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:35:37] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:35:39] water will raise it again here's the
[1:35:41] secret of this the word is in the
[1:35:45] bride so brother brandom says that God
[1:35:49] is not in the church God's in the word
[1:35:52] but the angel of the Lord said the word
[1:35:53] word is in the
[1:35:54] bride so if the word is in the bride God
[1:35:57] is in his bride amen God is in the
[1:36:01] church if the word is in the church if
[1:36:03] the word is not in the church God is not
[1:36:05] in the church because God is with his
[1:36:08] word and God is in his word now when he
[1:36:10] was talking about the uh the woman at
[1:36:12] the well and he was talking about you
[1:36:13] and I and he was talking about the eagle
[1:36:15] he said the word come to word amen
[1:36:17] there's word trapped down inside the
[1:36:19] children of God the seed genes of God
[1:36:21] attributes of his thought there's word
[1:36:23] laying there and he sends the word to
[1:36:25] wake up the word he sends the word to
[1:36:26] Quicken the word he sends the word to
[1:36:28] connect with the word to bring the word
[1:36:30] to life so where is the word the word is
[1:36:33] in the SE genene it's already there when
[1:36:36] God is in this the bride amen when God
[1:36:38] is in the word and the word is in the
[1:36:40] bride then God is in the
[1:36:44] bride and see we can never take a
[1:36:46] Catholic attitude to that and say God is
[1:36:48] in his bride now anything we believe is
[1:36:51] truth and anything we say is right as
[1:36:53] soon as we start tampering with the word
[1:36:55] of God like that we're doing exactly
[1:36:57] what the Catholic church has done amen
[1:36:59] we are yielded to the word we're not
[1:37:01] leading the word the word is leading
[1:37:03] us and when the word is in the
[1:37:06] bride God is in his
[1:37:09] bride and she is becoming the
[1:37:13] word remember said the bride becomes the
[1:37:16] word the church becomes the word by
[1:37:18] letting the word flow through
[1:37:20] it by what surrendering to the word how
[1:37:25] did Mary become the
[1:37:27] word remember when Mary was there heavy
[1:37:31] with child she was the
[1:37:34] word amen why was she the word because
[1:37:38] the word was living in
[1:37:42] her she was the very manifestation of
[1:37:45] what Isaiah spoke she became the
[1:37:47] manifested word how will we become the
[1:37:50] word when this word that's been preached
[1:37:52] this word that's been given from from a
[1:37:54] from a messenger to his bride when that
[1:37:56] little virgin bride can say be it unto
[1:37:58] me according to your word and that word
[1:38:00] comes in and takes root and takes life
[1:38:02] and begins to take over she will become
[1:38:05] the manifested word for her
[1:38:08] day by receiving the word and when she
[1:38:11] receives the word she receives the life
[1:38:12] of the word and the life of the word
[1:38:14] goes to work to bring the word in her to
[1:38:19] pass
[1:38:21] amen I'm so thankful God God sent his
[1:38:25] word and I'm so thankful God sent his
[1:38:28] spirit amen and I don't know how to
[1:38:30] separate those two but nothing in me
[1:38:33] wants to separate those
[1:38:37] two God is in his bride because the word
[1:38:42] is in the bride
[1:38:45] amen which word was it the word that was
[1:38:48] preached or the C genene of God before
[1:38:51] the foundation of the world
[1:38:53] I'd like to say
[1:38:55] both all that was preached takes
[1:38:58] resident in her and comes to life in her
[1:39:01] good ground amen all that God foresaw in
[1:39:05] a bride and predestinated and laid
[1:39:07] inside her as a SE genene will all come
[1:39:10] to life and manifest itself under the
[1:39:11] anointing of the word so where does it
[1:39:14] come from the word what brings it to
[1:39:18] life the life of the word which is the
[1:39:20] spirit how does it work I can't figure
[1:39:23] that out but one thing I know this word
[1:39:27] is changing
[1:39:29] me it's bringing things out of me that
[1:39:31] were deep inside it's cutting away
[1:39:34] things on the outside of me that always
[1:39:36] trip me up what's doing it it's the
[1:39:38] foolishness of preaching that's saving
[1:39:41] me it's the preaching of this message
[1:39:43] it's going back again and listening to
[1:39:46] it again going back to the tape again
[1:39:49] listening to cge is this the time again
[1:39:51] going back to the rising of the sun
[1:39:53] again again choosing of a bride again
[1:39:55] coming Wednesday hearing preaching
[1:39:57] coming Sunday what's it doing it's
[1:39:59] bringing the life of the word to life
[1:40:01] inside of me why because the word's in
[1:40:04] me so the word comes to me what does it
[1:40:07] do it reproduces the word through
[1:40:10] me what do I have to do I don't know
[1:40:14] what to do except say God you can have
[1:40:18] me amen I want to be your betting ground
[1:40:23] I want to be the place that this word
[1:40:25] falls into takes root and comes to
[1:40:29] life and I believe that I'm part of that
[1:40:32] good ground not because I'm
[1:40:34] good but because somebody foreordained
[1:40:38] there would be a ground for this seed to
[1:40:39] fall
[1:40:40] in and I just believe that I'm part of
[1:40:43] that good ground because the husbandman
[1:40:46] saw to it that when the seed went forth
[1:40:48] in this day there would be a place for
[1:40:50] it the land that it could grow and
[1:40:53] predestinated me and put a seed in me to
[1:40:56] connect with that seed so the two could
[1:40:58] come together to produce the life of the
[1:41:01] seed so what seed has come to us

[1:42:42] Thessalonians 2:13 for this cause also
[1:42:44] thank we god without ceasing because
[1:42:47] when you received the word of God which
[1:42:48] you heard of us you received it not as
[1:42:50] the word of men but as is a truth the
[1:42:53] word of God which effectually worketh
[1:42:56] also in you that
[1:42:59] believe he said I thank God that when
[1:43:01] you receive the word that we preach this
[1:43:03] is Paul we said you didn't receive it as
[1:43:06] it was the word of men but as in truth
[1:43:08] it was the word of
[1:43:09] God and then he says which effectually
[1:43:13] worketh also in you that believe what's
[1:43:15] working the word that you believe came
[1:43:18] from God under the preaching of Paul
[1:43:20] it's doing the work in youen
[1:43:23] it's changing you it's molding you it's
[1:43:26] bringing out virtues out of you what's
[1:43:28] doing it it's the word that we recognize
[1:43:31] not to be the word of Paul or the word
[1:43:33] of William Brandon or even the man in
[1:43:34] the pull pit we recognize it to be the
[1:43:36] word of God and it's that that we
[1:43:38] receive as the word of God that is
[1:43:40] working effectually in us who
[1:43:45] believe praise me to God I thankful that
[1:43:49] God gave me something to believe with
[1:43:53] yes and that was not my
[1:43:56] brain that was a SE Gene of God in my
[1:43:59] soul and it's deeper than anything else
[1:44:02] about me it's the original
[1:44:06] part I'm thank God he's bringing us back
[1:44:08] to the original
[1:44:10] part and let's bow our heads together
[1:44:13] Lord Jesus I'm thankful for your
[1:44:15] word here we are Lord on a Wednesday
[1:44:18] night because we need to be reminded of
[1:44:20] these
[1:44:21] things God we go out life and we get
[1:44:24] distracted and knocked down and make
[1:44:27] mistakes and do everything that your
[1:44:29] children in the Bible have
[1:44:31] done but God we have to come back and
[1:44:35] hear an eagle scream
[1:44:37] again so that we'll once again try to
[1:44:39] flap our wings once more and see if we
[1:44:41] can make it to that
[1:44:43] post maybe beyond the post to the
[1:44:46] rooftop maybe from the rooftop to the
[1:44:49] treetop one thing I know
[1:44:52] Lord that we're Eagles to begin with and
[1:44:55] we're going to
[1:44:56] fly we're going to fly out of here one
[1:44:59] day because we're Eagles to begin
[1:45:03] with though we were Eagles from before

[1:45:13] Eagles you never left it to ourselves to
[1:45:16] figure out that we were

[1:45:20] identify us you sent an eagle scream to
[1:45:23] wake us up to who we really
[1:45:25] are and God the fact that we could hear
[1:45:27] the eagle scream is a testimony of who
[1:45:30] we
