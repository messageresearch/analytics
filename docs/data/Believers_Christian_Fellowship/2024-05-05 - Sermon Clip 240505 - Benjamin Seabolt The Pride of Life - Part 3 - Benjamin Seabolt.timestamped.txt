[0:02] 2900 years ago a flaw in the spirit of
[0:06] Elijah's
[0:07] character and God
[0:10] says I have got to deal with that
[0:14] because this ministry this man this
[0:16] vessel is the vessel that I'm literally
[0:20] going to step into as the lamb and pull
[0:24] the seals off of the book and I cannot
[0:28] understand what I'm saying God's not
[0:29] taking it chance I cannot take a
[0:32] chance that when I put the power of the
[0:36] spoken word the cre the creative spoken
[0:40] word on his tongue that he will even
[0:42] interject himself slightly I've got to
[0:45] deal with this one I know it was 2,900
[0:48] years ago but I've got to make sure
[0:50] that's not going to rise up at the
[0:53] inopportune
[0:56] time I'm going to make a really drastic
[0:59] statement
[1:01] not
[1:05] Doctrine but I'm going to go here to 19
[1:08] 58 May the
[1:12] eth
[1:14] paragraph 63 how fitting 63 and he says
[1:19] now before it comes to pass I'm sparing
[1:24] you may the 8th
[1:27] 1958 paragraph 63 is literally the
[1:31] hinging
[1:33] point of whether the lamb can come and
[1:36] break the seals or
[1:37] not it's the hinging point because if he
[1:41] doesn't pass this test the lamb cannot
[1:44] step into this vessel am what if he
[1:47] comes to the first seal and says
[1:51] well I don't know what it is but I think
[1:55] it's right we're done yeah me and you
[1:58] would not be sitting
[2:00] here if he comes to these seals being
[2:04] loose and he and he doesn't know for
[2:06] certainty that I have to wait for God
[2:09] himself to come and speak this word out
[2:12] of me yes if I can interject anything of
[2:17] me into this me and you are
[2:20] doomed we cannot come into the full
[2:23] image of Christ amen and remember the
[2:26] seals were just not the interpretation
[2:28] of the symbols the seals were the
[2:30] release of the spirit of God to us it
[2:33] was the full not a partial dip but this
[2:36] this was the fullness of the spirit of
[2:39] God they asked brother brandom the
[2:41] question now that this has been released
[2:43] could you come and speak the word over
[2:45] somebody and instantly put them into
[2:47] rapturing condition and he says
[2:50] yes that's right amen amen what has he
[2:54] done to us Saints has not the word that
[2:57] he has came and spoken over top of us
[3:00] put us into rapturing
[3:05] condition that would have never
[3:08] happened if he would have said anything
[3:11] else in paragraph
[3:14] 63 this was the liftoff point because
[3:19] now God has rectified and it wasn't to
[3:23] say that brother Bram didn't have issues
[3:24] coming up in his life that he made
[3:26] mistakes and God had to deal with him
[3:28] but we're talking about a issue that was
[3:31] 2900 years ago in the spirit of Elijah
[3:34] that God is wanting to use to fulfill
[3:37] his
[3:39] ministry he's got to root that out of
[3:41] there he's got to expose that and he's
[3:44] got to get that out of there to go where
[3:46] he wants to go
