========================================

you know Sarah was struggling all along and misunderstanding but when God came on the plains of memory he began to deal with her he began to confirm the promise to her he began to show the mystery part was her that she had to Bear the son nobody else could do it it's got to be you it's not for somebody else it's not for another age God has come in this age and he's come to us individually he said listen he's showing the sign of the Messiah it's the son of man has returned Amen in a prophetic Ministry amen showing us it's not another age it's not for somebody else it's for you all these promises are for you amen the chains of the body is for you the overcoming life is for you healing's for you Deliverance is for you the change of your atoms is for you the slipping of Dimension it's all for you overcoming in Satan's eating it's for you amen it's all for you amen and he showed it and then now God so graciously one by one is individuals he'll come to you individually and confirm the promise and what did it do for Sarah what it did for Sarah was gave her faith amen because the Hebrews 11 says by faith Sarah receive strength herself too can save how did she do it by faith God needed Sarah to believe and what does God need from you and I he needs us to believe amen he needs us to believe the word for our day he needs to believe the promise that's for us he needs us not just to believe that it's for Abraham it's for Jesus Christ it's for a worldwide this no he needs that Faith to go down deeper and to understand the mystery part of the prophecies the mystery part of the Bible and the Mystery part of the Bible is that I'm included that I'm part of the word and part of the prophecy amen and God is coming today Amen to to show himself to confirm the promise to show that I'm part of it to build my faith because he needs me to believe praise God Amen so now it's not just saying God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God appeared God appeared why did he appear he came to deal with the woman amen he came to deal with the mystery part he came to raise our faith he come to meet us at an appointed time Amen in a private meeting so that we can have quickened faith to believe we're part of the promise why did that Prophet come amen why did he appear in the plains of memory why did we have a repeat of the days of summer why is all this happening I don't know for you but for me it's so that I could believe that I'm part of the promise that I could believe that I'm included in this Bible it's not just for others it's for me why because he turned his back to the crowd into certain thoughts and I said that's nothing but the Lord that's him he's appearing if he's appearing these scriptures are fulfilled if these scriptures are fulfilled what what's the reason because it's time for the promise it's time for the promise and and Sarah's Got to Believe he said God help me believe help me look at what you've done and recognize it and meet you personally and recognize it for me
