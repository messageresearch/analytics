you're doing in our lives and while we pray that you would come on the scene now as we look to your word that you would break the bread of life for us that you would feed us by your hand that you would strengthen us on your word and that you would give us Direction and correction Lord that you would guide us Lord for trusting in you we love you we pray take this vessel under your control and Minister precious Words of Life Lord through these lips of clay for God we have need of you in this hour We're trusting in you and we're believing in you and we're trusting in your way that you've promised we receive it Norm we ask your blessings over all that we say and do in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen man God bless you we're going to have you take your seats for just a moment thank you musicians amen we've had a bit of a busy morning amen we have some baptisms lined up this morning and we already had a baptism lined up brother Josiah priests is desired to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'll tell you about that in just a moment and um so we were planning on doing that today and I believe it was yesterday or Friday I don't remember which day I was talking with brother Levi and brother Levi Yoder and his family are here God bless you brother Levi and he brought you know a car full of guests with him and uh we were talking and he says there's somebody here I'm talking to that is interested in possibly getting baptized will you be set up for baptism on Sunday I said yes we will praise the lord it's already in the works God's already working so I thank God that he he was able to do that so there's actually three individuals that have come with brother Levi that would like to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so we're so thankful God is moving and God is working and God is finding his children and drawing them amen and Levi's been witnessing to him about them about water baptism and their Andy Byler and that name may sound familiar because Andy Byler is the father of Daniel Byler and Daniel Byler as part of the group in Junction City who was baptized with the 17 that got baptized at once and his father Andy was there when Kyle baptized brother Jesse that time and so God is working and Brother Andy told me that God pricked his heart then amen so God is moving amen we're so thankful and then there's a sister Amina schwarzen struber and a brother Robert wagler so we'll be happy to baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ at the end of this service amen you know we had a little bit of a busy morning I wanted to go back and meet with them and talk to them and appreciate your patience as I've ran around amen God is good but we want to say welcome to all the visitors that hear Brother Arley stutzman God bless you it's good to have you back with us again and everybody else is visiting if you're a visitor God bless you you're welcome and you picked a wonderful Sunday to come because we have a fellowship dinner after church and so we want you all to know you're very welcome to stay and have fellowship with us and we'd love to sit and talk with you and get to know you a little bit better amen so it's a it's an exciting day you never know what's going to happen when you come to church amen God always is moving God is always working and I'm so thankful for that amen I love to see God finding his sheep and drawing them to himself it's so exciting there's something fresh and rejuvenating about it for all of us amen I also want to remind you that I will be leaving brother Jonathan baumgarner and I will be leaving this Thursday to head to Europe we'll be going to Poland for meetings and then to Romania for a family camp and while I'm gone uh the Ministry schedule will be the first Sunday which is July 23rd brother John Kadeem is coming to preach for us so it's exciting to have him back I'm hoping he can give a testimony and an update on what God is doing for them and the start of that church man God has certainly been blessing them and then Wednesday will be Brother Kyle he'll be preaching here Wednesday July 26th and then Sunday July 30th brother Emmanuel Sebastian will be preaching for us and brother emanuel's getting ready to take quite a long trip a Ministry trip with brother Randy sias to the Congo so hopefully he can give you a little bit of a heads up what he's doing there letting you know kind of the schedule so we can be praying for him in that trip so there's a lot happening amen and God is good and I'm so thankful amen I'm so thankful to be part of a living God a living moving God who's moving and doing and drawing and calling and changing us and growing us and molding us into his image it's exciting amen I want to take just a moment and talk about uh brother Josiah priest re-baptism because I want to do a little bit of teaching before we go into that and before I get into the sermon that I want to get into but if you could turn with me to the book of Acts I'm going to read one scripture together one that we're very very familiar with Acts chapter 2 verse 37 Acts chapter 2 verse 37. says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promises unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen uh brother Josiah and I have been talking he came to me uh several weeks ago and we he discussed his desire to be baptized again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I talked to him and I found that his reasoning his desire was was good he has a wonderful desire he knows that he's not required to be re-baptized he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as a boy amen but but there's something that's in his conscience that he wants clear amen he wants to know that he's on a good foundation and when he talked to me he understands where he is scripturally he understands he's not required but this is for conscience sake and I say God bless you amen I'm happy to do it he wants to know that his foundation is solid and I say God bless you and so because of that I wanted to just go over uh re-baptism and then there's two forms of rebaptism there's a re-baptism because we were not baptized scripturally and many of us have received rebaptism because we weren't baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how many of you were re-baptized because your first baptism was not scriptural amen so that's one rebaptized re-baptism but in this case our brother received scriptural baptism the correct way but he desires to be baptized again and so brother Branham got this question and questions and answers in 1954 so I want to go over him the question was I was baptized at the age of 13 should I be again and and there's this is a long answer but I'm going to pull some excerpts out of his answer he says if you've been a Christian all along since she was 13 years old a believer in Christ I just remain like you are I wouldn't now if God has blessed you give you the Holy Spirit since then and the baptism is only a form it's just to show the world or the congregation that you're with at the time that you before Witnesses prove that you have believed that God sent his son and he died and rose again on the third day and he was buried into him and have risen to walk a newness of life and them same people that watched you when you was baptized will meet you at the Judgment scene so he's saying that that baptism is a witness to that congregation or wherever you're at that you have have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ that you believe amen that I'll read it again that you believe that God sent his son and and he died and rose again the third day and he was buried into him and have risen to walk in newness of life amen that's what you testify when you take water baptism that you believe Christ died for you amen and so and that you want to walk in newness of life with him and then further down he says but you say brother Bill did you ever baptize anybody over who'd been baptized when there was a little fellow and then be re-baptized and he says many times and then he's going to go into a scripture and he's going to correct a misunderstanding so I want you to catch this he said there's a scripture over in Revelations the second chapter speaking to the church said repent and do your first works over again and many of them interpret that scripture to say this that that means you'd have to go right back and do the same thing over well if you notice dear Christian friend now I'm not disagreeing with this now because we've got the Baptist refilled up we're ready to baptize anybody that wants to be baptized at any time but we're not disagreeing if you want to be baptized if that's something that stands in your way and you feel like you should be you go do it that's right you do it don't let nothing stand in your way you make yourself perfectly clear amen so then he goes down and he says if you want to be baptized again go ahead that's the thing to do I baptized many over but now to that scripture that you were referring to he's referring to Revelations the second chapter when when he says repent and do the first works again he's saying that the understanding is when you've Fallen away this is the understanding that we had in Pentecost when you've Fallen away then you've fallen out of Grace now you're a sinner again and you've got to go through the whole process over again of repentance and making your life right and all of that brother I'm saying that's not necessary that's not true he says now to that scripture that you're referring to that wasn't talking to an individual that was to the church see the church what they have done they had lost their first love the real cream that they had in the beginning and he said lest you repent and do the first works over again start right back and get the thing he's talking to the church unless you repent and go back again well then he was going to move the candlestick that you want but if you want to be baptized and if you was baptized when you was 13 or whatever age why you be baptized it's in your own way but now to say that scripturally I could say that you should be re-baptized again there's only one scriptural way that that I could advise that people was re-baptized there's only one scripture in the entire Bible that people was rebaptized and that was those who was baptized by John the Baptist before the Holy Ghost came Paul in Acts 19 5 told them that they had to be re-baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ in order to receive the Holy Ghost so then he goes down a little further he says now this is it it's but just say that you were baptized in Christian baptism at the age of 13 and you've lived a Christian Life all the way along or if you've backslid a few times I don't know whether they got a backslide I wish somebody would go to ask me that he's doing questions and answers and he wished he had a question on backsliding he says I wish they'd asked me that but on backside remember you backslide every day there's no way at all for you to keep out of it all right but you backslide to the people in the church but not before God you backside on Christ but you don't own God because when you sin you're gone but you're constantly falling Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time and if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to do that aren't you that's right now if you've been if you've been redeemed and you feel that the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed you from sin and you've lived a Christian Life I wouldn't think it'd be necessary but if you want to all right it'll be fine we'd be glad to do it so I wanted to lay down that teaching because I don't want you know many of you were baptized as a child and some of you as young as seven or eight years old were baptized as a child and when you see somebody that wants to be re-baptized for conscience sake it may start a questioning in your heart but don't let it start a questioning in your heart because the baptism if you took scriptural baptism to baptism is good just because you failed God we've all failed God that doesn't mean you have to be re-baptized just because you vaccinated you failed and gone you've made mistakes that doesn't mean you've got to go back and redo the baptism the baptism was a good scriptural baptism and then there's also the idea that but I didn't understand correctly when I was six seven eight years old but I was 21 years old when I got baptized and I didn't understand correctly I was honest to what I understood and what I saw I followed through with but I know a whole lot more now than I knew that day and if every time we understand baptism better we have to get re-baptized we might as well keep a line at the baptism every service right so I don't want anybody to be confused amen if you were baptized honestly with an honest heart at the place you were at at the time you were baptized and you were baptized according to the scripture your baptism is good so don't let the devil trouble your mind amen that the the case with our brother is he he knows that God's dealing with him and this is something he wants to do for himself for conscience sake to Sure up his foundation amen because he's questioning his motives at the time but not that he was baptized wrong or not because he did anything wrong are we squared away all right I don't want to have 10 baptisms the next Sunday because what will happen is if the devil starts to send you down that path he'll actually trouble your faith and actually move you off your foundation so there are times that it's appropriate and this is the case where it's appropriate there are times where it's appropriate it's a good thing and it'll be a blessing to somebody but there are times where if you keep questioning the foundation you're going to undermine your foundation and you'll constantly go from one question to the next question to the next question so I want everybody to be understood if you have any more questions on that you can come and ask me because I I want to have a good clear understanding so I hope we have a good clear understanding and now we can Rejoice for our brother because he's going to walk out of there knowing he's obeyed the Lord and everything is solid under his feet amen also for these three others will be baptized they'll walk out of there knowing they've kept the word of God they fully obeyed what God assured them to do if there's anybody else present who would like to be baptized today the baptism is open it's available we have clothes we have robes if you didn't bring clothes we have clothes for you and you're welcome to be baptized at the end of service I'll invite those who want to be baptized to go around back and if you're here and not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but would like to do so to fulfill the word to know your conscience is clear that you've done what the Bible says do this is a golden opportunity this morning that God has given you amen praise God I'm ready to preach let's stand let's stand and and respect to the word let's stand and read their scripture in in mark 16. Mark 16 and verse 12. this is after the resurrection of Jesus Christ it says Mark 16 verse 12 after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country may the Lord bless us as we look at his word you can be seated again I want to preach this morning on the appearing of the Lord and just want to look at that subject for a little bit this has actually become quite a huge subject for me as I look into it but I don't want to go into all of it there's only one aspect that I want to look into so when when we see this it says after that he appeared in another form unto two of them Jesus Christ had resurrected from the dead he had went to Calvary uh he he had went to Calvary and died he resurrected and now he was seen of Mary Magdalene and when when she saw him she didn't recognize him she thought he was the gardener and she had spent so much time with him she knew him she knew him intimately she knew him well these two that were on the road to Emmaus or the other two that he showed himself to he appeared in another form they were intimate with him they knew him they knew him well and though he walked with them for six hours and talked with them along the way they didn't know who it was Mary Magdalene who saw him after his resurrection amen she knew him so well loved him so dearly but she thought he was a gardener didn't realize that it was the Lord and we see that after the resurrection of Jesus Christ he can appear in another form and this word appear here is the word fanaru in the Greek then in listen when I say the words in Greek I'm doing the best I can please don't copy me you embarrass yourself if you try to sound intelligent to somebody else this is the best of my understanding the Greek word fanaroo and it's interpreted make manifest to appear to manifest to show but in the definition in the concordance it says to make manifest or visible are known what has been hidden or unknown to manifest whether by words or deeds or in any other way so here Jesus is being manifested are making visible after his resurrection himself but he's doing it in another form not they didn't see him as the same Jesus that they walked with in the same physical features they would have known him right off but here they walked six hours discussing with him things and they don't recognize him they invite him to dinner they don't recognize him they sit down they don't recognize him but at the table he does something just like he did it before and their eyes were open and they knew it was the Lord so the appearing of the Lord amen when we when we talk about the appearing of the lord we know that the Lord has appeared in our day is that right but but we're not looking for the nail scarred hands amen we're looking for the word made manifest looking for the Lord and so we'll get into that but but I wanted to lay this down as a foundation so that we understood amen there's so many times that that that terms mean something in our mind but we may have the wrong picture of what that term means amen so the appearing of the Lord doesn't mean that you'll when he appears that you'll always see him in the form he was crucified in but yet it's still him it's still him and he's still appearing or manifesting or revealing what was previously hidden but it may not be the same form let's turn to the book of Samuel first Samuel first Samuel chapter 3 verse 1. first Samuel chapter 3 verse 1. and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open Vision this word precious can mean rare so the word of the Lord was very rare in those days because there was no open vision and and we know that Samuel was the daughter of Hannah Hannah had prayed for a child she was Barren and she prayed Eli prayed for her and she dedicated she promised the Lord he gave her a son she would dedicate to the Lord so she has Samuel and she takes Samuel back when he's weaned and dedicates him to the Lord and Samuel lives in the temple all of his life it would be the Tabernacle at this time and and now you know he he's growing up there but God's calling him calling him to be a prophet of the Lord and we sign the condition that we're in in this time you're in a time that the word of the Lord is rare because there's no open Vision it's been a long time since they've had a prophet just like the laodicean church AJ man the word of the Lord was precious in this day it was rare amen because the churches had by intellect taken the word and twisted it to their understanding and the true word of God had become rare has become manipulated it's become tainted it's become I mean people were doing the best that they knew how amen were not criticizing them but in the best that they knew how was false fell far short of the true interpretation of the word so so we were in a time in this age that the word of the Lord was rare and there was no open Vision there had been no Prophet since the Apostle Paul and so when we look at first Samuel 3 let's go down to verse 19. it says and Samuel grew and the Lord was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground and all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel and Shiloh by the word of the Lord here the Lord appeared what did he look like what form when we see this is an appearing of the Lord in the Bible the Lord appeared again in Shiloh so he hadn't been appearing in Shiloh why wasn't he appearing in Shiloh because the word of the Lord had become rare there was no open Vision amen Shiloh was the temple it was where they had the uh the priests were operating and all of that but now it says the Lord appeared again in Shiloh amen wow did he appear he appeared through a prophetic message because the word came back to Shiloh and when the word came back to Shiloh through a prophetic gift the Lord appeared once again in Shiloh man oh praise God can we say Amen the Lord appeared once again in our day the Lord appeared once again amen where he was before he appeared once again amen he was in the church but the church bound him by rivers of denomination and Creeds amen limiting the Holy Ghost limiting the word amen but he comes Unbound at the end of the ages by a prophetic Ministry and a message that is Unbound now the Holy Ghost back in the church again and now he's showing it through a sign through a prophetic gift and and the and the the Lord appeared in our day once again the same way he appeared in that day chapter 4 verse 1. in the word of Samuel came to all Israel so we think the Lord appeared again in Shiloh for because the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord when the word of the Lord came Samuel the Lord appeared again in Shiloh but then the next line the word of Samuel went out to Israel the question is was it the word of Samuel was it the word of the Lord praise God I love the way the Bible's written friends it's so beautiful was it the word of Samuel or was it the word of the Lord amen that's why on our day you people ask you know why is it you quote a prophet why do you read his books amen because the Lord appeared again in our day the Lord appeared again in the church again he's come back to the church he's come back to the Gentiles the Lord appeared again in our day in the church amen because he gave the word of the Lord to the prophet William Branham amen and now the word of William Branham went out to Israel but I can look beyond that and I can see this is the appearing of the Lord this is the word of the Lord this is why we read message books this is why we listen to tapes this is why we quote the prophet the same reason why they listened to Samuel is the Lord appeared again when he brought his word this word appeared in this scripture it's translated to see look at inspect perceive consider it means to appear or to present oneself to cause to see or to show the Lord when he brought the word back through a prophet he unveiled himself he showed who he was he showed himself amen he declared through his word because God is the word amen that's John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and God is the word and when God brought the word back to a prophet God made himself appear again by bringing that word he he presented himself he appeared praise God sometimes appearing is not always what we think I say when you say he appeared in Shiloh run to Shiloh and find him run to Shiloh and describe what he looks like run to Shiloh and tell me what his voice sounds like run to Shiloh amen because What You Won't See Is him what you will see is a prophet who's bringing his word and that word is him the prophet's not him but the prophet standing there is a representation of him because he's bringing the word of God and God is the word and God's presenting himself in Shiloh again praise be to God so what does he look like what does his voice sound like how tall is he he appeared he appeared did you say he appeared he appeared I should be able to tell you how tall he is what is no it's not that kind of appearing and he appeared in our day let's go to Genesis 18. this one we know very very well but we have to look at it right now or at least I do Hebrews 18 or sorry Genesis 18 sorry Genesis 18 verse 1. Genesis 18 verse 1. he says and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the Tipton Door In the Heat of the day so this is the Lord this this word Lord is Jehovah amen the self-existent one who reveals himself almighty God Elohim this is who this is and the Lord appeared unto him who's him it's Abraham the Lord appeared unto Abraham and the plains of mammary and he sat in the tent during the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and loathed three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and he said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from my servant let a little water I pray they be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and Abraham hastened into the tent into Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal need it make cakes upon the Hearth and Abraham ran into the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto the young men and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and a calf which he addressed and said it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat here the Lord appeared and he's eating in Shiloh he appeared but what form was it here he appeared in another form and he appeared in a form of Flesh as a man and we know the prophet tells us amen that this was a temporary dwelling place for God not a permanent God's permanent body of flesh is Jesus Christ and that would be birth through the womb of a virgin amen this was a temporary place that he took the elements of the ground created a body stepped into it and in this appearing he took on a form of Flesh where he could drink milk eat butter eat the Flesh of a calf and talk to Abraham verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tenth and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind them now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of Surety bear a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son see the Lord is Discerning the thought of Sarah not the words of Sarah she didn't speak this she thought this in the tent and he sitting with his back to the tent she's in the tent behind him amen he's Discerning her thoughts so here and disappearing he's in a body of Flesh amen and he's eating and drinking and visiting and brother remember says he has dust on his clothes and he that he had to have his feet washed he had dust on his feet he come in flesh and he could discern the thoughts of Sarah behind him he also could tell them the correct names because just before this they were Abram and Sarai and now God had changed their name supernaturally visited them and changed it to Abraham and Sarah and hear this man that shows up on the scene he knows their correct name he can say your name is Abraham your name is Sarah and he can discern the thoughts behind him so I want to continue reading and so he asked why did Sarah laugh is anything too hard for the Lord at the appointed time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sheriff shall have a son verse 15 then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou dids laugh and the men rose up from thence and looked towards Sodom and Abram Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation in all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children after him I'm not going to read any further but he goes on to tell him that destruction time has come that judgment is coming upon Sodom and Gomorrah for their sins have reached into heaven so this this appearing of the Lord he appears in a body of Flesh that's not his permanent flesh that's going to be Jesus Christ his only begotten son but he's in a body of flesh eating drinking dust on his feet amen he knows their name amen he knows where to find them he can discern the thoughts behind them and he's going to tell him the pending judgment and what's about to happen this scene has repeated in our day the same scene has been laid out for us and repeated again in our day the prophet of God says in the message the identified Christ of all ages he says and what that man that man in that human flesh what did why did Sarah laugh what happened Abraham called that man Elohim almighty God represented in human being Jesus our lord says as it was in the days of La so shall it be at the coming and watch when the son of man is being manifested made known Luke 17 when the son of man in the last day is being revealed the son of man being revealed his gospel is identifying him as it was in the days of lot look how they're doing now perverting Nations oh my look at the homosexuals and look at what we got now the church is a mess the nation is a mess and the whole thing God is belching it up from the top bottom of the Earth the whole thing is a mess graphically and also in the material the scene is said isn't it time for God to come back in human flesh the word that's sharper than a two-edged sword and discerner the thoughts and intents of the harm to appear on the scene to make Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's a promised word that's been lauded for this day we are living in this day and God is here with us to manifest that and make it true he says in God's provide a place of worship but we promise just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man came down in human form three of them two angels and God himself that was God the Bible said it was now he come down and he manifested himself here there by turning his back to the tent where Sarah was and told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the tent that's right now Jesus himself said at the day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ himself when Jesus Christ was on Earth he called himself the son of man the son of man all through the gospels he calls himself the son of man amen but he lays down a prophecy in the Bible and we want to turn there to the Book of Matthew let's turn together to Matthew Matthew 24. Matthew 24 and verse 36. he says but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only I love I you know I say this all the time but I love the Bible and I love this message because they dovetail together the the message illuminates the scriptures and and Reveals All The Hidden Truths he says but of that day an hour north no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only so Jesus is saying of that day and hour nobody knows not even the angels of heaven but only my father but he doesn't leave it there he says but as the days of Noah were now all of a sudden he's saying I can't tell you the day or hour but I can give you a clue I can give you a clue so that you will that you'll have something to look for amen so that you have something to discern amensely or something to look to in my word so you can say this is that but as the days of nowhere so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving and marriage until the day that Noah entered the Ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be so in the coming of the son of man it'll be as it was in the days of Noah what was it like in the days of Noah in the days of Noah a man's heart was evil continually there was men taking women to be wives amen marriage and divorce and remarriage was on the Rampage violence filled the Earth every desire of a man's heart was only evil continually amen I say we've come back to the days of Noah and in the days of Noah God sent a prophet to prepare a way of Escape amen God sent a prophet with a message and that message was salvation to that generation if they would only believe him and get in the ark amen and he says as it was in the days of Noah if you say as it was in the days of Noah then there must be a repeat amen somebody's got to be building a giant boat no he's showing you in symbol form in a foreshadow what's coming amen but the foreshadow is not going to be a repeat of somebody building an ark the ark that's built now is Christ the word amen if you come into Christ the word you'll be saved praise God so in the day all this evil and all this wicked we've returned to that time and in that time God sent a prophet with a message and gave a way of escape to the pending judgment that's repeated in our day let's look at Luke together Luke 17. this is the other scripture that the prophet of God references over and over again Luke 17. in verse 26. Luke 17 26 men's Hearts failing them for fear I'm sorry I'm in the wrong one Luke 17 sorry I'm in the wrong chapter Luke 17 26 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man so we see Jesus is speaking in the same passage and a different and this is Luke but he's speaking the same thing as it was in the days of no so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given and married until the day that Noah entered the Ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed prophet of God would go to the scripture over and over and over in his ministry showing that there's coming a day that the son of man will be revealed and it'll be when the world is in a condition like it was in the days of life and where was lot lot was in Sodom what was in Sodom sexual perversion homosexuality violence and all kinds of manner of corruption and sin was there a have we if we come to that place again I mean it wasn't just homosexuality in Sodom it was aggressive homosexuality and we have come back to that time but praise God in that time the Lord appeared that scene the Lord appeared and he made a way of Escape amen but oh praise be to God that he came to his elect who was trying to live a separated life from the world and he came to his elect and he revealed himself in flesh with discernment amen and he showed him the sign of the Messiah before the Messiah even came and so in the days of lot we see we've returned to the days of lot Sodom and Gomorrah is all around us but all in the days of lot there was an appearing of the Lord in flesh praise God I want to jump over here and read something the message perseverance says Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the returning of the son of man it'll be the same thing in the days that you notice in Sodom there it said in Luke 17 15 it said when the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed in the days that the son of man is revealed like he was at Sodom the same thing will be taking place so he ties it right back to these two scripture passages and ties it right back to Genesis 18 and says in the day that the son of man is revealed it'll be like it was there and that's exactly what happened in our day that God came down in human flesh the Flesh of that prophet and he began to operate through that flesh body and declare that I am here and he brought the word back and the Lord appeared in our day the Lord appeared in our day he says in who is this Melchizedek and being that I've told you all these nights tonight that he is not dead he is here and promised to do the same thing and promise that there would come a time in the last days according to Malachi 4 and according to Saint Luke that he would appear again in human form among his people and do the same things and reveal the same things the same Messianic sign when God appeared to Abraham he could discern the thoughts of Sarah behind him when Jesus stood on this Earth he could discern the thoughts of the Pharisees and to serve the thoughts of those around him amen but when God appeared in this day amen through a prophet messenger and through that prophet he could discern the thoughts of the people and so we wouldn't miss what he was doing he would turn around at the end of the service and turn his back to the so he wasn't looking at anyone amen and he would begin to call people out in the balcony and over in the back and over on this side amen with his back turned to them why was he turning their back some of them are so far away there's no way you could recognize him anyways he wasn't turning the back to make it harder he was turning his back so you would see we've come right back to the days of lot we have returned to the days of Sodom and Gomorrah we've returned this prophecy is now being fulfilled in our eyes amen why so we could recognize the appearing of the Lord that he's here he came as the son of man and the coming of the son of man he come to reveal himself praise be to God in the Feast of Trumps he said how will the Messiah how will the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is then he said the wife shall know but the foolish the unwise would not they shall know their God but now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen we know when we read the New Testament when we get to the Book of Revelation all of a sudden in the Book of Revelation I mean we start to see this term come up we start to see this term of Bride and Lamb's wife Amen in the marriage of the lamb and all of a sudden we can see at the end of the New Testament they're supposed to be a marriage they're supposed to be a wife they're supposed to be a bride and whose bride is it it's the Lamb's bride it's the Lamb's wife amen and so we we recognize amen that that this church this New Testament Church has to come to be the Bride of Jesus Christ so this bride amen she was stuck in all kinds of church traditions and all kinds of misunderstandings amen but we know Christ is the word amen if you'll turn with me to John John chapter 1 and we'll read this very familiar passage of scripture but we want to look at it again John chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so then we jump to verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God but then that word that is God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the flesh of Jesus Christ in that Jesus Christ is the Lamb that will have a wife he is the word made flesh he is the word in full measure he became the Flesh of the word the full declaration and one human being of all that God was was manifest in Jesus Christ he was the expressed image or the exact image or the full image in flesh of God and he was the word made flesh and so now this lamb this Christ he's got to have a bride and that bride will be a gentile bride amen made out of the Gentile church and that bride is coming at the end in the Book of Revelation and she's coming into manifestation amen but that bride has got to know who her husband is but she's confused about her mate she's confused about her husband because of all the church traditions and all the doctrines and all the denominations and all that's happened for the previous 2000 years so God in his goodness he's going to come and appear at the end time amen how is he going to appear through a body of Flesh and he's going to show the sign of discernment amen he's going to be in the form of a man but he's going to show the sign that this is more than a man that's why the prophet would say I can't do that you didn't touch me who did you touch you touched the priest the hymn of the high priest I can do nothing for you I'm just a man and when he would discern he said now you know that's not me a man can't know that that has to be him so that we would see the appearing of the Lord but how did he appear in the appearing he brought his word why did he appear this is what he says he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word he appeared so he can introduce himself to his bride so that she can actually know who her mate is who the bridegroom really is so that she'll stop marrying churches she'll stop pledging herself in churches and giving herself to churches and doctors and dogmas so that she'll stop doing that but she'll bring amen so that she will bring herself she'll recognize her mate and lay herself down at his feet in him only he appeared in this day that's how he appeared is to bring the people back to the word when when God presented himself to Abraham in the plains of memory he did so for a purpose when he appeared he appeared for a purpose because there was a prophecy that needed to be fulfilled there was a promise that he had made and that promise was that Abraham shall have a promised son an heir and that will be Isaac and and it had been 25 years since the promise was given but yet no Isaac amen and in that time so many things had happened and and so many miscalculations and missteps and and and all of these things but in that time the prophecy was still true and it had gone so long and now Abraham and Sarah are getting older and older and older until I cease to be with them after the manner of a married couple and and now he was as good as dead and she was dried up but he was going to come on the scene to fulfill the prophecy he wasn't just making an appearance to make an appearance he was making an appearance to accomplish something he was coming on the scene to accomplish something because you know everything has its appointed time and it's a point of season and God came and tells Abraham who's the father of the faith amen Abraham believed God and it was imputed in him for righteousness so Abraham comes and he believes the promise and he receives the message for his day that he's going to receive a promised son that he is the going to inherit this land and God's called him into a life of Separation to come into the land and God's going to give it to him and to his children and that he's going to have an heir that's all the word for his day and he continually separates and moves more into this vision and more into this Vision over time he gets more aligned with the prophecy as time goes on but then you know Sarah is also there and she knows the prophecy and she knows the promise to Abraham and she knows that Abraham will have a son and and although they were young and they lived together as young man and woman from the time they were young they together could never produce a child it could never produce a child but Abraham could produce a child because when Sarah said the Lord has withheld me from bearing take my handmade he took Hagar and he produced a child so Abraham could produce a child hey but Sarah didn't believe she could produce a child she said the Lord has withhelding me she didn't believe she could produce the child amen and so they're moving all along and they have all of these things and I would say the biggest problem with Sarah is Sarah didn't recognize she was an integral part of the promise she didn't recognize herself in the prophecy amen she it's not that Sarah disbelieved the word because she believed whatever Abraham told her I'm sure she believed that God spoke to Abraham and Abraham would have a son that's why she's saying take Hagar maybe this is the way to fulfill the word it's not because she doesn't believe it she doesn't believe she can do it she's not doubting the promise she's doubting her part in the promise so God has got to come on the scene when we realize when God comes on the scene God is not necessarily dealing with Abraham he's already met Abraham multiple times he's met Abraham and met Abraham and met Abraham and met Abraham but this time when he comes to meet Abraham he's dealing with Sarah amen now he comes and he and he's and now Sarah has this doubt she has this unbelief that's holding her down amen and now he begins to show the sign of discernment and now it's not just out there over here but now it's for her now he says why did Sarah laugh in the tent and then she denied it and he says but you did and the whole thing's exposed and and now he says I will visit you according Amen to the time of life and you shall and Sarah shall conceive you shall have a son all of these things are part of the promise and what God does is he comes back on the scene in his appearing and he says listen you're missing a part of this you're part of the promise and he's coming amen so that Sarah now knows you're part of the promise amen because there's a church amen and the church has believed in Jesus Christ and believe he's the son of God and believed in the Holy Ghost and believed that Paul was an apostle and believe that the Bible is Right amen but where is her doubt where's her misunderstanding she's not catching that she's the mystery part Sarah wasn't catching that she was the mystery of the prophecy the mystery the hidden part because Abraham could produce the son Abraham could have haggar Abraham could have had otherwise Abraham could have sons but that's not the prophecy the prophecy is he will have an heir amen and that air has to come from his wife because his wife is part of him Amen in order for it to come from him it's got to come from both parts of him Abraham and his wife so now in this appearing he's showing himself in his power to her praise God for what reason because it's time to fulfill the promise because it's the season to fulfill This Promise in order to fulfill This Promise Sarah has to believe in order to fill the fulfill his promise Sarah has to believe amen if you'll turn with me to Genesis 21 well let's go to Genesis 18. let's go back to Genesis 18. Genesis 18 and 13. and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have surely bear a child which IM old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied that means Sarah heard all of this before God is dealing with Abraham with Abraham with Abraham but now he's coming to deal with Sarah and make and he told Abraham Sarah shall have a child but this time she heard it herself after he showed the sign and the discernment and now he says Sarah shall have a son and so let's go over to Genesis 21 he said I will return unto you according to the time of life and we come to chapter 21 Genesis chapter 21 it says in the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him what was the mystery part of this prophecy the woman it was Sarah there's been a mystery part amen through the New Testament and that mystery part is the bride my God although the prophecies were there although Paul spoke of it although he laid it out amen there had to be an appearing in the end time amen where God would show that I'm here God would show himself like he did on the plains of mamrid God would fulfill the prophecy that Jesus laid down in the coming of the son of man in the revealing of the son of man he would come back as the son of man through a prophetic office and he would show the sign of discernment and he would confirm the promise Amen to the bride to the church you're the one you're going to bear this son you're going to display the life of Jesus Christ it's you and then the next visitation from the Lord is a private visitation to Sarah he comes to her and he confirms the promise in her now let's go to Hebrews I know we've been through these scriptures before but let's go to Hebrews 11. verse 11. Hebrews 11 11. in Hebrews 11 11 says through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed it was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised you know Sarah was struggling all along and misunderstanding but when God came on the planes of memory he began to deal with her he began to confirm the promise to her he began to show the mystery part was her that she had to Bear the son nobody else could do it it's got to be you it's not for somebody else it's not for another age God has come in this age and he's come to us individually he said listen he's showing the sign of the Messiah it's the son of man has returned Amen in a prophetic Ministry amen showing us it's not another age it's not for somebody else it's for you all these promises are for you amen the change of the body is for you the overcoming life is for you healing's for you Deliverance is for you the change of your atoms is for you the slipping of Dimension it's all for you overcoming in Satan's eating it's for you amen oh for you amen and he showed it and then now God so graciously one by one as individuals he'll come to you individually and confirm the promise and what did it do for Sarah what it did for Sarah was gave her faith amen because the Hebrews 11 says by faith Sarah receives strength herself to conceive how did she do it by faith God needed Sarah to believe and what does God need from you and I he needs us to believe amen he needs us to believe the word for our day he needs to believe the promise that's for us he needs us not just to believe that it's for Abraham it's for Jesus Christ it's for a worldwide this no he needs that Faith to go down deeper and understand the mystery part of the prophecies the mystery part of the Bible and the Mystery part of the Bible is that I'm included that I'm part of the word and part of the prophecy amen and God is coming today Amen to to show himself to confirm the promise to show that I'm part of it to build my faith because he needs me to believe praise God Amen so now it's not just saying God sent the prophet God sent a prophet God appeared God appeared why did he appear he came to deal with the woman amen he came to deal with the mystery part he came to raise our faith he come to meet us at an appointed time Amen in a private meeting so that we can have quickened faith to believe we're part of the promise why did that Prophet come amen why did he appear in the plains of memory why did we have a repeat of the days of sun why is all this happening I don't know for you but for me it's so that I could believe that I'm part of the promise that I could believe that I'm included in this Bible it's not just for others it's for me why because he turned his back to the crowd into certain thoughts and I said that's nothing but the Lord that's him he's appearing if he's appearing these scriptures are fulfilled if these scriptures are fulfilled what what's the reason because it's time for the promise it's time for the promise and and Sarah's Got to Believe say God help me believe help me look at what you've done and recognize it and meet you personally and recognize it for me see Sarah recognizing it for Abraham didn't fulfill the promise Sarah believing Abraham should have a son and even trying to provide a means for that that didn't fulfill the promise but what fulfilled the promise is when she believed prophet of God said in the message God is his own interpreter he said now I'm claiming that he is not dead he's just as much alive today as he ever was and the Bible said Jesus said himself as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now look no matter what kind of gift that God has up here there's got to be one down there to respond to it praise God no matter what signs are on the platform there's got to be a faith there's no he says no matter what kind of gift that God has severe there's got to be one down there to respond to it you have to have a gift too what's that gift the ability to believe you have to have something to believe with amen praise God he went to the city there was many things he could not do because of their unbelief is that right same thing today you've got to believe him you've just got to believe him that's the only way you can praise be to God and the countdown he says he is able to achieve to himself a bride he is going to in the last days he's able to get a bride that with a ministry that's so exactly like a man and his wife becomes one and when ju this is the statement I want you to lock in on for just a minute when Jehovah gets his people like him when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one what's got to happen we've got to become like him and we got to be molded amen we got to be molded by his word we've got to be shaped by the word things have to be cut off of us we've got to be pliable amen under the word we've got to come into His Image and to his likeness and he says when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture exactly what he said in John 14 12. he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also it also fulfilled that Jesus said would take place as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man praise be to God and the message proving this word I'm going to read a quote that I've read many times so you know it don't tune out on me because you know all these words but it's so applicable here what we're talking about he's talking about the sign the time of Sodom when the world's in a condition like Sodom again in the days of lot in the days of Noah and the son of man Ministry and he says as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed this isn't for another church or another church age or another church this is calling out the bride because she's the mystery part that must believe her part of the word in order to come to the Fulfillment of the promise what to do what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together their church has to be the word he is the word and the two unite together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergy man I don't know do you see what I mean see it's son of man amen and brother bear said he was a son of man a son of man is a prophet revealing the son of man the son of man is Jesus Christ the prophet amen it's a prophetic gift it's a prophetic sign it's a prophetic age and Christ himself came down amen through that prophetic office and he used the prophet on Earth to manifest his own Ministry misplay himself it was a son of man revealing the son of man says son of man you see what I mean it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage the marriage of the Lamb has come we're in the Book of Revelation the sign of the end times have are all around us the prophecies are being fulfilled the signs that he foretold they're all here amen the the sign of the Messiah has been displayed the son of man Ministry has returned All For What because it's the time of the promise and Sarah has to believe he goes on to say the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing what is it that it was a son of man revealing the son of man for what purpose so that the son of man could Unite with his bride is what he said to manifest us on a man to unite the two together so that they could unite the two together to do one so that Christ Jesus himself the son of man could display himself through his bride now I would listen to this quote carefully here and the voice of the sign says the identification of God has always been knowing can foresee what has been until what has been how is that or what will be prophetic we know that that's how the prophets was known that's how Jesus was known as the Messiah and he's the same Messiah today as he was then only without a Corporal body here on Earth he sent his Spirit back to use your body in my body now you might not be able to do this brother I was talking about his own gift as a prophet of discernment and prophecy he said he might not be able to do this we know in the scripture there's one in a generation but see but yet you can believe it and you've got other things that you can do everybody we're not trying to replicate brother banham it's because the son of man was displaying himself there and now the son of man's in the bride the son of man is in the bride globally universally not in one man he's come to unite with the bride and within us he's manifesting himself Amen in a portion that's allotted to us he says it this way in spiritual food and due season he said now if he appeared to us in a physical body look just exactly like Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 and blood running out of his hand and so forth nail scars all over him I wouldn't accept it so brother man said I wouldn't accept it because that's not how he's appearing to the Gentiles in the end time when we see him in his body of Flesh it'll be after our bodies change and we translate and we'll see him and as we translate we'll meet him in the air but it doesn't mean we can't see him because he's appearing when he comes his self every eye shall see him every tongue shall confess him as the lightning coming from the East and the West so shall it be see we don't believe these Cults and clans we believe God is the word but he embodies himself taking your body and my body and gives you gifts gives me gifts and through these gifts He makes himself known what is it Jesus Christ himself the ministry of the son of man came and displayed himself through a prophet showed the son of mess I fulfilled the prophecy showed us the age we lived in pointed out of the signs interpreted the word and broke the seals all to what so that he could Unite with you so that you could come into a union with him so that now he could live through you so he could live through his bride in the end time and what do we have to do you only have to do what he leads you to do do I have to have this manifestation of that manifestation you have to do whatever God gives you the gift to do that's what you're to do it only sends one prophet in a generation we don't all become that amen but God's called each of us into a position he's called us into a certain way amen and God wants to live his life through us it's amazing how Sarah when she was there in Genesis 18 she's there in old age she's there in disbelief not disbelieving that it's God not this believing that Abraham's right but disbelieving that she can possibly be part of the promise that it could work through her but what God does in his grace is he comes and shows the sign of the discernment to her he reveals to her the thoughts that are in her heart now it becomes personal and brother America said God embodies himself in my body and in your body and when the prophet of God was here amen he would come down and he would discern people and he would say your name is this and your address is this and before you came this morning you were kneeling or sitting at your bed facing to the east and you were praying such and such you know what that became personal God became personal ity how many times has God become personal to you through the preaching of the word through the fellowship of Believers through a song that was sung how many times has the son of man showed himself through the body how many times have you got a phone call from her brother at just the right time and they said just the right thing and there's no way for them to know how many times have you got a card in the mail or an email or a text just the right thing to say it just the right time and you know that person doesn't know how many times have you come to church and had a conversation repeated back to you from the pulpit how many times did somebody come and felt inspired to write a song they'll come up or have a song special they'll sing the song Find a song They're inspired to do it and the song will match exactly the preaching for that day he's embodying himself who is it the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ himself where does he want to Ministry where does he want to move where does he want to work he wants to finish he wants to finish his work in Bride form he wants to finish the work in you amen he'll come down and he'll discern you he'll discern your thoughts he'll speak back to you what you said amen he'll show you what what your question is he'll answer it he'll have somebody call you somebody talk to you something will happen and all of a sudden you recognize this is personal to me God knows where I live God knows what I'm thinking God knows what I'm saying and God knows what my question is why is he doing that because he wants you to believe you're a part of the promise not just to show a sign not just to make an appearing but that you understand what they were in what age were and that God is after you too because you're part of this you're not on the sideline you're part of it let's go to Galatians chapter one Galatians chapter 1 verse 15. Galatians chapter 1. verse 15. it's the Apostle Paul speaking he says but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I confer not with flesh and blood Paul is saying that God separated me from my mother's womb God called me knew when I was born brought me on this Earth at a specific time then he let me go so far but at an appointed time he met me in the pillar of Fire what for to reveal his son in me all of that had a purpose not so that Paul could say I saw the pillar of fire I saw the pillar fire I saw the pillar do you know there was a pillar of fire no so that God could get his attention and bring Paul into his portion of the word so that Paul could believe amen because Paul was disbelieving the Christian message so God comes to him God calls his name God says a prophet to pray for him amen God speaks to him Amen to what to bring him in to his portion of the word and he says when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me so where was God going to reveal the son and Paul this word revealed I think I have a definition somewhere maybe not this word reveal is the word I don't want to get it wrong yeah this word reveal is a word that's used in Peter to mean appearing I'll read it to you first Peter 1 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire it might be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ he says he wants to reveal his son and me he wants to appear in me this word is a apocalypsis it means Revelation manifestation coming appearing a laying bear a disclosure of Truth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ where did he want to appear and Paul where did he want to manifest himself in Paul and through Paul I love that that's a repeat of our day he revealed himself through that prophet but Paul doesn't stop there he goes down a little further if you go to Galatians chapter four and go to verse 19. in Galatians 4 19 Paul says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you Paul wasn't saying God only wants to appear in me but he's also saying I'm laboring I'm trying to bring forth the finished product that Christ will be formed in you and if Christ is formed in the church or in the bride it would be Christ in Bride form and that's what Paul was laboring that's what he was working for in laboring travailing in birth again laboring that Christ would be revealed in them it wasn't so that Paul could have it all and Paul could be the revealing and Paul could have the manifestation of Christ and Paul could have the word god appeared in Paul Amen to bring the word his appearing bringing the word amen to the Gentiles so that the Gentiles can receive Christ and Christ can be formed in them and now the appearing can be in them man God has appeared in our day you believe that I believe he wants to keep appearing he appeared in the ministry of William Branham but I believe he wants to be appearing in Bride for him declaring himself showing that it's him in her his character his life his works his attributes his deeds his surrender his obedience his love I believe he wants to show his signs I believe what Paul was laboring to do God intends to be accomplished in this day well Paul was travailing in birth to try to bring forth I believe God is bringing it forth in this hour this is the age for that but he's got to have a Sarah who will believe it he's got to have our Sarah who's had her thoughts discerned who had her questions answers he's got to have a Sarah that has seen a living God a real God a manifestation of God an appearing of God who also can come into a private meeting with God and realize by faith that it's got to be me this has got to be I've got to be part of it it's not going anywhere without me laughs amen that's not arrogacy that's Faith that's faith in recognizing your position and all of a sudden you say I have got to surrender myself more because it's not going anywhere without me I'm part of the promise I've Got to Believe prophet of God says God's body United as his bride being one him and Christ together is the spirit working in the flesh of the church like it worked in the flesh of Jesus Christ because it's part of his body not Twain but one they are one husband and wife is no longer Twain but one and Christ in his body is one and the Same Spirit was in Christ is in his bride and his body that unites them together with all the word and God living in their himself manifesting it oh Paul was laboring he was the foundation Paul said I laid the foundation as a wise master builder I laid the foundation a foundation for what a foundation for a bride I laid the foundation he said be careful how you build watch do how you build on this the seven churches The Messengers have been building on it but by the grace of God we're in the Capstone age in the completion what he was laboring for is to be birthed amen Christ will be formed and you and I in the message shalom Prophet says now I say to the church Shalom God's peace every true Hebrew when he meets another one Shalom other words good morning God be with you God's peace go with you it's a good morning how do you do it's a breaking day church it's Darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church the world's in darkness laodicea is in darkness Sodom condition but oh praise God he's appeared to us the light has come it's a good morning to the church Christ is appearing Among Us Shalom peace Hallelujah shalom when we see Darkness settling Darkness just before day we know that the morning star is hanging Yonder to introduce the coming Sun it's that's when the Morning Star shines it's the going between It's always darkest just a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day is becoming the light because the light is pressing the darkness but the Morning Star comes out and says good morning shalom that's him Among Us his word being identified shalom I ask you as have you seen the appearing of the Lord has he appeared in our generation did you see him working through that Prophet did you see the same signs did you see the prophecy fulfilled praise God did you see the repeat of the planes of memory then praise God let's let that produce What It produced back there let it produce that in me God came in that day to deal with the mystery part he's coming this day to deal with this mystery point to bring me out of spiritual Amnesia to bring me out of church confusion to bring me into the understanding of who I really am and what he intends to do with me in this day to snap me out and bring me back let that appearing work that goal to bring Faith to say Here I Am Lord being unto me according to your word God is good friends we've seen his appearing I wonder if we can go a little deeper I wonder if we're still seeing his appearing we look around we Fellowship we see the word changing people's lives see the illumination of the Gospel coming out of a Brother's mouth coming out of his sister's mouth coming out of their conduct their character glowing with the character of Christ we saw him appear but are we seeing him appear I want to see him still appearing I want him to be appearing in me I want to be yielded and surrendered and I want this word to bring a life out of me all I can say is Here I Am Lord I believe it I believe it I don't know how but I believe it I'm not worthy but I believe it I'm not capable but I believe it look at Sarah she wasn't worthy she was not capable she she did she tried to lie in the face of God but it didn't change her position in the word we failed a million times we may fail a thousand more before the year is over with but it doesn't change anything by Revelation I see my position in the prophecy I see my position in the word and all I can say is being unto me according to your word Lord all I know to say is here I am God use me Purge me cleanse me shape me by your word and use Me For Your Glory I'm laying down my life because I believe that I'm part of your bride and I believe that I'm United with you and I believe you want to live through me and I want to give you that right amen let's all Stand Together oh this word is so tremendous it's so beautiful and I'm just so thankful that God let me hear it listen just to hear the word of God as a privilege when there's darkness in the world there's a famine not for in the food or water but a famine for hearing the word of God just to hear it is a tremendous I'm so glad he let me hear it and then a Step Beyond that I'm so glad he put something in me by predestination that could believe it Millions have heard and walked away amen but I heard and I said it's got to be true it's got to be right amen I can't see any other way where that should be the happiest people for us it's shalom Church good morning the Sun is up amen it's rising where is it Rising it's rising in my heart it's growing brighter and brighter in my life he's changing me I'm changing to become him he's becoming me I'm becoming him and the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word what a statement think about that statement the prophet made in the hour when the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word that literally happened to Sarah her flesh became the word of that prophecy that literally happened to the Virgin Mary her flesh became the word may manifest and if it can literally happen to them it can literally happen to me this flesh can become the word may manifest and conduct and in life and in action and in Supernatural and in everyday life and in everything this flesh can become this word May manifest say God have your way with me amen let's bow our heads to pray those who would like to be baptized if you want to just go around the back here there'll be a deacon that will meet you there let's bow our heads together oh dear heavenly father I thank you God in this age Lord we would have wandered from Pillar To Post we would have been in the world we would have been in a church system we would have been who knows where we would have been but God you made sure that we saw your appearing you made sure that we came in contact with the Living God with the word made flesh in our day so that we could hear it that we could see it we could hear the testimonies that we could know it's real God that's your grace and mercy in our lives we could have so easily walked by and never known what you had done in this generation we could have continued on in religion we could have continued on on our selfish desires but God you and your grace like you did for Peter like you did for Paul you came to them God somewhere along the line you came to each one of us and we saw your appearing we wouldn't be here if we didn't oh God that appearing produced something in Sarah you begin to deal with her on a personal level and you begin to bring her into the prophecy and you begin to change her so that she would be able to bring forth the son God in the appointed time you showed yourself to her and made it personal and in the appointed time you went to her personally in a personal visitation and out of that she received Faith by faith she received strength to conceive God you've spoken to us personally maybe this morning Lord you spoke to somebody personally maybe you discern their life you spoke to them you're calling to them God I pray that you would come to them in a personal visitation that would Quicken a seed of Faith within them that
