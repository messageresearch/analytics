[0:00] amen there are some that have had their
[0:02] eyes open and they can see him and they
[0:05] can see him where he is and they can see
[0:07] him in the form that he's in it's always
[0:08] the form that throws him off it's always
[0:10] the form that brings confusion amen but
[0:13] it's him just the same amen when they
[0:15] were walking with Jesus Christ on the
[0:17] road to Emmaus he the scripture says he
[0:20] appeared to two others in another form
[0:22] he was in another form their eyes were
[0:24] withhold and they couldn't tell who it
[0:26] was but it was the very same one amen it
[0:29] was the same person it was Jesus Christ
[0:31] began to speak to them and discern and
[0:34] share the scriptures with them amen
[0:36] until he broke the bread a certain way
[0:38] and their eyes were open they knew who
[0:40] it was and he was in another form and
[0:42] they couldn't tell who it was but it was
[0:44] the same one he was there
[0:48] amen praise be to God and when the Jesus
[0:52] broke the bread it didn't open their
[0:54] physical eyes it opened their spiritual
[0:56] eyes and they could discern who it was
[0:59] when he returned amen when he
[1:01] resurrected amen and Mary was in the in
[1:03] the garden looking for him Mary's
[1:05] looking for him amen where have you laid
[1:07] him she's looking for a dead corpse
[1:09] she's looking for the one that was
[1:10] nailed to the cross amen and here he is
[1:13] standing alive amen resurrected alive
[1:15] but she assumes he's the gardener
[1:19] Mary knew what he looked like amen Mary
[1:21] had been with him she had served him she
[1:23] had talked to him amen she knew what he
[1:25] looked like so he's standing here in
[1:27] another form in the form of the gardener
[1:29] because he is the gardener amen and he
[1:32] is the seed and he is the fruit
[1:35] and he's standing as the gardener amen
[1:37] and and she doesn't know who she's
[1:39] talking to she's asking the gardener
[1:42] where Jesus is and the gardener is Jesus
[1:46] [Music]
[1:47] where is Jesus he is Jesus but he looks
[1:50] like a gardener and she assumes he's the
[1:52] gardener she thinks she's talking to a
[1:54] gardener and she's talking to Jesus
[1:56] Christ
[1:57] some people that think they're talking
[1:59] to church members they're talking to
[2:01] people who believe a message but they
[2:03] don't know what's behind those people
[2:04] they don't know what this word is this
[2:06] word that we're giving is Jesus Christ
[2:09] it is him he is the word
[2:15] she said please sir tell me where you've
[2:17] laid him and I'll go get him
[2:19] and he said Mary
[2:22] when he called her by name she knew who
[2:25] it was she said rabboni Master amen and
[2:28] fell at his feet amen when he called
[2:30] your name all of a sudden you knew who
[2:32] this was that was speaking to you who's
[2:34] present who's here who was in that
[2:36] prophet and who's in The Bride
[2:39] amen amen just because multiples the
[2:43] multitudes don't seem doesn't mean he's
[2:45] not here when everyone sees him that's
[2:47] not the fearing that we're looking for
[2:49] that's not the coming and that is
[2:50] exciting to us amen although that'll be
[2:53] exciting amen because we return with him
[2:55] but the one that's exciting to us is the
[2:57] one that's going on now when he's coming
[2:59] and taking us in a Rapture and catching
[3:01] us away word by word by word until
[3:03] finally we make the final translation
