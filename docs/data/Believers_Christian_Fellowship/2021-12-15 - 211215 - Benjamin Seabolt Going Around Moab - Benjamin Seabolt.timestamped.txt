[3:03] [Music]
[3:10] praise the lord let's just pray together
[3:13] precious lord jesus we just want to
[3:17] pause here for a moment lord and
[3:18] approach you by way of prayer
[3:21] lord to thank you for this opportunity
[3:24] once again that you've provided to us
[3:26] lord that we could gather and assemble
[3:28] ourselves together around your revealed
[3:31] word lord and to come and to worship you
[3:34] in spirit and in truth
[3:36] and lord i pray that as we would come to
[3:38] this juncture in the service that you
[3:39] would come now father
[3:41] lord as we so often say but it's
[3:44] every time true lord there is not a
[3:47] mortal man that can stand here and do
[3:49] the task that is at hand
[3:51] father for only the lamb can break the
[3:53] seals lord and only you can feed your
[3:56] sheep father so he would ask that you
[3:58] would come now and that you would
[4:00] supernaturally do what you've
[4:02] preordained for this service to do
[4:04] father we just yield ourselves to you
[4:07] both speaker and here
[4:08] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[4:10] pray amen
[4:13] god bless you if you have your bibles
[4:14] we'll go to revelation chapter four
[4:18] i appreciate the
[4:20] song that we just sang there very
[4:22] fitting
[4:23] for where i want to go here
[4:26] through an open door
[4:29] so we
[4:30] want to go through that door and we want
[4:32] to close that door
[4:35] revelation chapter 4 very familiar
[4:38] portion of scripture here
[4:42] and it says after this i looked brother
[4:44] branham said after what
[4:46] after the church ages
[4:48] after this i looked and behold a door
[4:50] was opened in heaven
[4:52] and the first voice which i heard was as
[4:55] it were a trumpet talking with me which
[4:58] said come up hither and i will show thee
[5:01] the things
[5:03] which must be hereafter
[5:05] let's turn to revelation chapter 10.
[5:12] also very familiar here
[5:16] revelation chapter 10 verse 1
[5:19] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[5:21] from heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[5:24] rainbow was up on his head and his face
[5:26] was as it were the sun and his feet as
[5:29] pillars of fire
[5:30] and he had in his hand a little book
[5:32] open
[5:33] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[5:35] and his left foot upon the earth and he
[5:37] cried with the loud voices when a lion
[5:39] roareth and when he had cried seven
[5:41] thunders uttered their voices
[5:44] so we have an open door
[5:46] and we have an open book
[5:48] let's turn to matthew 23 for our last
[5:51] scripture reading
[5:54] matthew 23
[6:00] and verse 12.
[6:07] matthew 23 and 12
[6:10] and it says whosoever shall exalt
[6:13] himself shall be abased
[6:15] and he that shall humble himself shall
[6:17] be exalted
[6:19] but woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[6:22] hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of
[6:24] heaven against men for ye neither go in
[6:27] yourselves neither suffer ye
[6:30] them
[6:31] that are entering to go in
[6:34] god bless you as you would
[6:36] have your seats so we can see here that
[6:38] we have an open door
[6:40] we have an open book but in matthew 23
[6:43] we have a group of people that wants to
[6:45] shut that
[6:46] up so
[6:50] god himself is opening the door
[6:53] god himself is opening a book
[6:55] but man
[6:57] is trying to shut this
[6:59] and we obviously know that that can't be
[7:01] pleasing to god because
[7:03] what god wants to open
[7:06] he does not want a man to shut
[7:08] i want to
[7:09] look at a topic here this evening of
[7:12] going
[7:13] around
[7:14] moab
[7:15] and i think that will make more sense to
[7:17] you as we progress here going around
[7:20] moab
[7:22] turn to numbers chapter 20.
[7:31] numbers
[7:32] chapter 20.
[7:44] this is dealing with israel
[7:47] after they
[7:48] have left egypt
[7:50] they are on their way to the promised
[7:52] land
[7:54] but for just prior to coming to the
[7:56] promised land to going over into canaan
[7:59] to crossing jordan and going over into
[8:00] canaan they come up against two
[8:02] countries
[8:03] and that's moab and edom and they stack
[8:06] right on top of one another moab is just
[8:08] north edom is just south and soon as you
[8:11] cross through them
[8:14] then you're into canaan land where they
[8:16] were headed to
[8:18] but in numbers chapter 20 verse 14 it
[8:20] says and moses sent messengers
[8:23] from kadesh unto the king of edom now
[8:25] this portion here just says edom it
[8:27] doesn't say anything about moab but
[8:29] we'll get the second portion in judges
[8:32] he's dealing with both countries here
[8:35] thus saith thy brother
[8:39] israel
[8:40] thou knowest all the travail that hath
[8:42] befallen us how our fathers went down
[8:45] into egypt and we have dwelt in egypt a
[8:47] long time and the egyptians vexed us and
[8:50] our fathers and when we cried into the
[8:52] lord we heard his voice and he sent an
[8:55] angel and hath brought us forth out of
[8:57] egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city
[9:00] in the uttermost of thy border
[9:02] let us pass i pray thee through thy
[9:05] country we will not pass through the
[9:07] fields
[9:08] or through the vineyards
[9:11] neither will we drink of the water of
[9:12] the wells we will go by the king's
[9:15] highway we will not turn to the right
[9:17] nor to the left until we have passed thy
[9:19] borders
[9:20] and edom said unto him
[9:22] thou shalt not pass by me
[9:26] lest i come out against thee with the
[9:28] sword
[9:31] so not only is he not going to let him
[9:34] pass by
[9:36] but he will use the word
[9:38] against him if need be
[9:42] and the children of israel said unto him
[9:44] we will go by the highway
[9:46] and if i
[9:47] and my cattle drink of thy water then i
[9:50] will pay for it
[9:52] i will only without doing anything else
[9:55] go through on my feet
[9:57] and he said thou shalt not go through
[10:00] and edom came out against him with much
[10:02] people and with a strong hand
[10:04] thus edom refused israel
[10:07] to give israel passage through his
[10:09] border
[10:10] wherefore israel turned away from him
[10:14] judges 11 verse 16 you don't have to go
[10:16] there because it's basically giving the
[10:18] same recount here but i want to read
[10:20] this to you
[10:21] judges 11
[10:23] but when israel came up from egypt and
[10:25] walked through the wilderness under the
[10:27] red sea and came to kadesh then israel
[10:29] sent messengers under the king of edom
[10:31] saying let me operate thee pass through
[10:34] thy land but the king of edom would not
[10:37] hearken there unto and in like manner
[10:40] they sent unto the king of moab but he
[10:42] would not consent
[10:44] an israel abode in kadush
[10:47] then they went along through the
[10:48] wilderness and compassed the land of eno
[10:52] and the land of moab and came by the
[10:54] east side of the land of moab that's
[10:57] just a fancy way of saying that they
[10:58] went around those two countries
[11:02] and pitched on the other side of arnon
[11:05] but came not within the border of moab
[11:09] for arnon was the border of moab
[11:15] so israel
[11:16] has been supernaturally
[11:19] delivered the scripture says by an angel
[11:22] to lead them out of egypt
[11:24] we know that angel by the name of moses
[11:27] but
[11:28] israel as an as a natural nation has
[11:32] supernaturally
[11:34] been delivered from the nation of
[11:36] uh egypt
[11:38] they have been given a direction by god
[11:41] of where to go
[11:42] and on their way there right before they
[11:45] get there they come against these two
[11:47] countries which they refer to as
[11:50] brothers
[11:52] and this is factually correct because we
[11:54] know
[11:55] that moab came from lot
[11:58] which was abraham's nephew
[12:01] israel's abraham's seed
[12:03] we know that edom
[12:05] came from esau
[12:09] so this is factual this is literally
[12:12] relatives
[12:13] and they have come to them and they said
[12:15] god has supernaturally moved in our life
[12:17] he has picked us up he has put us here
[12:20] and he has told us to go right here
[12:23] but in order to do that we simply need
[12:25] to walk through your country
[12:27] we don't want anything we're not asking
[12:29] you to support us
[12:31] anything god forbid that we would damage
[12:33] or that we would take or we uh would use
[12:36] as we would be going through
[12:38] inadvertently we'll pay for it we'll
[12:41] compensate you for it we just asked you
[12:43] let us pass through
[12:45] and now their relatives their family
[12:49] not only says no
[12:52] not only let me back up they not only
[12:55] won't support them
[12:59] family
[13:02] they not only won't support them
[13:04] but they says they say no
[13:07] you will not even walk through here
[13:10] you will not even come through our
[13:12] countries
[13:13] and farther more
[13:16] so they won't support them they won't
[13:18] allow them passage but furthermore if
[13:21] you even try
[13:24] we will come out against you with the
[13:26] sword
[13:28] so now they're going to slay they're
[13:30] going to fight and slay their own
[13:33] relatives
[13:37] over simple passage over simply walking
[13:40] through somewhere
[13:42] without even taking anything without
[13:44] even asking for anything
[13:46] but if you try to walk this way
[13:51] we will come out against you with the
[13:52] sword
[13:55] earnestly continuing for the faith 1953
[13:58] brother branham says if you'll notice
[13:59] for a few minutes look at israel in the
[14:01] wilderness and was getting ready to
[14:03] cross
[14:04] moab wouldn't let them cross the country
[14:06] now moab was believers
[14:10] the moabites you know who it was the
[14:13] generation that came from lot's daughter
[14:16] where they lived with their father
[14:19] and the oldest one went over and the
[14:22] land of moab came from him
[14:25] in the church age book brother ram says
[14:27] the moabites
[14:29] knew the truth
[14:32] whether they lived up to it or not
[14:38] they knew the truth
[14:40] whether they lived up to it
[14:43] or not
[14:45] does this sound like somebody that you
[14:47] know
[14:50] does this sound like somebody that you
[14:52] may know maybe somebody you have to deal
[14:54] with on a daily basis
[14:57] maybe somebody you look at in the mirror
[15:01] that you tell the truth to
[15:04] over
[15:05] and over
[15:06] and over
[15:10] it knows the truth
[15:12] but it fails to walk in it
[15:15] and you constantly have to bring it back
[15:17] into subjection
[15:21] don't put it farther away than it needs
[15:23] to be
[15:24] don't put it farther away
[15:26] than the person sitting in your pew
[15:28] in your chair
[15:30] new knows the truth
[15:33] constantly knows the truth it's
[15:35] constantly being subjected to the word
[15:38] your hybrid spirit and your hybrid flesh
[15:40] flesh constantly being subjected to the
[15:43] word
[15:45] always fails to walk in it
[15:48] if it if you give it its free choice if
[15:50] you give it its free reign and you don't
[15:52] constantly bring it into subjection it's
[15:54] not going to do it voluntarily
[15:56] furthermore it will not support you if
[15:59] you walk that way
[16:00] your hybrid spirit and your hybrid flesh
[16:02] is not going to support you
[16:04] and furthermore
[16:06] it is not going to allow you to do it
[16:08] freely
[16:11] it is not going to support you it is not
[16:13] going to encourage you and it's not
[16:15] going to do it on its own free will
[16:17] and
[16:20] if it sees that you're making progress
[16:22] in that way
[16:23] it will come out against you
[16:25] and it will fight you tooth and toenail
[16:27] as they say
[16:30] or maybe that's just me
[16:32] maybe i'm the only one
[16:36] but what a
[16:38] paradox so to speak
[16:40] that you have a supernatural move of god
[16:45] undeniable supernatural move of god to
[16:47] the point that they testify it testify
[16:50] about it they say we've heard of you all
[16:53] we've heard of what this god can do
[16:57] but we're not going to support it and
[16:58] you're not coming through here and if
[17:00] you try we're going to kill you
[17:03] your your spirit and your flesh are
[17:06] witnesses of what god has done in your
[17:08] soul
[17:08] it is undeniable
[17:11] it is constantly being subjected to that
[17:14] it knows the reality of that but it just
[17:19] won't let you
[17:20] walk through
[17:25] 1947 the children of israel
[17:29] brother random says now she moves on
[17:32] speaking of israel and finally they came
[17:34] down through the land of moab there and
[17:36] the king balak he thought he would be
[17:39] wiped out
[17:41] so now brother branham is going into the
[17:43] mind into the spirit of this king of
[17:46] moab and he's starting to deal with what
[17:48] was really motivating him what was
[17:50] really
[17:51] uh
[17:52] what he was really basing his decisions
[17:54] off of and he's catching the spirit that
[17:57] he's operating under and he says that
[18:00] the reason that he won't support them
[18:02] the reason that he told him they can't
[18:04] come through the reason that he says i
[18:06] will come out against you with the sword
[18:07] if you try as he said he thought he
[18:10] would be wiped out
[18:14] self preservation
[18:18] and he said oh this great company here
[18:21] that's like will lick us up like the ox
[18:24] licks the grass up off of the earth
[18:30] it's going to be wiped out
[18:32] your hybridization is going to be wiped
[18:34] out
[18:37] but it's a concern to it
[18:40] that's why brother branham says he he
[18:42] goes into the spiritual and he picks
[18:43] this out and he says this is why
[18:45] remember we're taught what happened
[18:47] naturally in israel happens spiritually
[18:49] to the bride
[18:51] and this is
[18:53] this is the stage of the battle
[18:56] just before they cross over
[19:00] just prior to going into the promised
[19:02] land
[19:03] this is what starts taking place
[19:07] 1953 earnestly continued for the faith
[19:11] now balak rather the king of moab he was
[19:14] not an infidel
[19:15] he was a believer
[19:18] sure he was and balab wasn't an infidel
[19:21] the prophet he was a believer here's two
[19:24] sets of believers them same spirits like
[19:26] cain and abel they come right down now
[19:29] again
[19:30] now notice here was a man the king of
[19:32] moab
[19:34] he said
[19:36] come down and curse this people
[19:42] believers
[19:44] cursing
[19:45] believers
[19:49] remember this is just prior to entrance
[19:53] to the promised land
[19:57] somebody thinking they're going to be
[19:58] wiped out
[20:00] and believers
[20:03] cursing believers
[20:08] these believers up here are jealous of
[20:11] these believers he's saying moab is
[20:13] jealous of israel
[20:17] why
[20:19] because god is with those believers
[20:23] that's the reason
[20:24] so moab again they they know that god is
[20:28] with this group of people
[20:30] they know
[20:32] what's going they can see what has
[20:34] happened to the people that have
[20:36] confronted israel and the circumstances
[20:38] that have confronted israel as they have
[20:40] been on this journey and now they come
[20:43] right up to the gates of moab and moabs
[20:45] can see the history
[20:48] your spirit and your flesh can see the
[20:50] history
[20:52] they know what's coming
[20:55] but they're not it's not going to roll
[20:57] over and just give it to you
[21:01] it says that it's jealous
[21:05] this spirit is jealous
[21:07] because it can clearly see that god is
[21:10] with this believer
[21:13] so he says now
[21:15] he goes
[21:17] and he gets a fallen prophet to come and
[21:21] to curse
[21:22] these true believers
[21:25] 1954 the end time he says moab sent over
[21:28] to an old backslidden prophet over there
[21:30] said come over and curse israel
[21:32] could you imagine
[21:36] both of them believing in the same god
[21:39] one wanting to curse the other
[21:44] he's jealous of him
[21:47] them men died
[21:49] but that spirit still lives
[21:53] could you imagine he asks could you
[21:55] imagine
[21:57] could you imagine
[21:59] surely that wouldn't happen now in 2021
[22:02] surely those spirits are gone now
[22:04] believers cursing believers
[22:08] using a false prophet a false ministry
[22:12] to curse believers
[22:15] he's jealous of him
[22:17] them men died but that spirit lives on
[22:21] 1962 in fellowship brother branham says
[22:23] remember when israel came up from egypt
[22:26] moab met him and wouldn't let him have a
[22:29] revival in his land
[22:31] look how brother branham is breaking
[22:33] down the spirits that motivated the
[22:35] decisions
[22:36] moab don't want to be wiped out
[22:39] jealous of them
[22:41] and he says
[22:44] they he did not want them to have a
[22:45] revival in his land
[22:48] there was no cooperation and moab
[22:51] believed that the same god that israel
[22:52] believed in they went and got their
[22:54] bishop down there balak
[22:56] uh he means balaam he said balak but
[22:58] that's okay
[23:00] brought him down there and he was just
[23:02] as fundamental as israel was
[23:07] moab failed to see
[23:10] that pillar of fire going before them
[23:14] they failed to see that brass serpent
[23:17] and that smitten rock following them
[23:20] although israel had done wrong
[23:24] moab failed to see the pillar of fire
[23:26] they failed to see the smit the brass
[23:28] serpent they failed to see that smitten
[23:30] rock
[23:33] pillar of
[23:35] brass serpent
[23:37] smitten rock
[23:40] moving objects
[23:43] remember moab was a nation brother ram
[23:45] said it was a nation established had
[23:47] borders was not moving
[23:50] i would dare to say that they were no
[23:52] longer reaching out in the spirit
[23:55] but now here comes a people here comes a
[23:58] nation that does not have borders a
[24:01] nation that's simply going somewhere god
[24:03] told them to go a nation simply
[24:06] trying to get through an open door a
[24:08] nation simply trying to go through an
[24:10] open book
[24:12] and there's a pillar of fire and a brass
[24:14] serpent and a smitten rock moving
[24:16] objects that's following them
[24:20] and the carnal believer moab is jealous
[24:24] and he's concerned and he don't want to
[24:26] be wiped out
[24:28] so he starts cursing the true believer
[24:35] you would think at some point in time if
[24:37] you could recognize this much
[24:41] look what god did for these people
[24:44] look what's following them
[24:46] we know we'll be wiped out if they
[24:48] confront us
[24:50] you would think at some point you would
[24:52] kind of go back to that old cliche if
[24:54] you can't beat them join them
[24:59] but the spirit can't
[25:02] that spirit can't
[25:04] remember this is a spirit that can look
[25:07] into the face of god
[25:10] that can look into the face of god and
[25:12] says and say your judgment is too harsh
[25:15] on me
[25:16] i just slayed my brother
[25:18] but you can't do that to me it's too
[25:20] harsh
[25:22] what a spirit
[25:24] how brash how bold
[25:28] remember brother brown said spirits
[25:30] don't die
[25:32] and it comes to the point that spirits
[25:35] won't even subject himself to common
[25:38] sense
[25:41] they can recognize what's going on
[25:44] but they still
[25:47] can't just leave it alone they still
[25:48] just can't move out of the way and let
[25:50] somebody walk through
[25:52] they have to resist it in their church
[25:55] age book brother branham says another
[25:57] illustration that we might take
[25:59] is this story of israel leaving egypt
[26:01] for canaan land
[26:02] god's purpose in this age was to bring
[26:05] israel out
[26:07] and take them in to the end that they
[26:11] might serve him thus when they left
[26:13] egypt they all came out from under the
[26:15] blood of the sacrificial lamb they all
[26:18] went through the waters of baptism in
[26:19] the red sea they all enjoyed the mighty
[26:22] miracles all eight of the manna all
[26:25] drank of the rock and insofar as obvious
[26:28] external blessings
[26:30] and manifestations were concerned they
[26:33] all partook in like an equal manner
[26:38] but
[26:40] when they came to moab
[26:42] those who joined in the fels the feast
[26:45] of bel pior all died
[26:49] their carcasses fell in the wilderness
[26:52] for it was there that they refused the
[26:54] word of god and turned from it
[26:58] now this is what hebrews 6 1-9 speaks of
[27:02] you cannot just go along with part of
[27:05] the word you have to take all of the
[27:08] word so excuse me brother branham now
[27:11] draws an equal sign between hebrews 6 6
[27:15] 1 through 9 and what happened at bel
[27:18] peor
[27:19] hebrew 6 therefore
[27:21] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[27:23] of christ let us go on unto perfection
[27:29] leaving the doctrine of the principles
[27:31] of christ
[27:33] i'm sorry leaving the principles of the
[27:35] doctrine of christ
[27:37] let us now go on to perfection
[27:40] you won't get to perfection unless you
[27:42] go through an open door and you're
[27:43] eating out of an open book
[27:46] let us go on to perfection not laying
[27:49] again the foundation of repentance from
[27:51] dead works and of faith towards god of
[27:53] the doctrine of baptism and laying on of
[27:56] hands and of resurrection of the dead
[27:58] and of eternal judgment let us not let
[28:01] let us not tie up all the loose ends
[28:03] again
[28:04] we've got the loose ends
[28:07] they're tied up we appreciate the loose
[28:09] sins but let's now go to perfection
[28:12] let's now let the lamb come and take the
[28:15] book and loose the seals
[28:17] let's now have the fullness of
[28:19] revelation
[28:20] not partiality
[28:22] let's not seek the
[28:24] gifts but the giver of the gifts
[28:27] let's seek him
[28:32] and this we will do paul speaking still
[28:35] and this we will do if god permit
[28:39] for it is impossible for those who were
[28:41] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[28:43] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[28:45] the holy ghost and have tasted the good
[28:47] word of god and the powers of the world
[28:49] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[28:51] them again unto repentance brother
[28:53] branham remember is drawing an equal
[28:55] sign
[28:56] between israel at bel peor and what they
[28:59] did in hebrews 6
[29:02] if they shall fall away to renew them
[29:04] again unto repentance seeing they
[29:06] crucified themselves the son of god
[29:08] afresh and put him to an open shame
[29:12] for the earth which drinketh in the rain
[29:14] that cometh off to upon it and bringeth
[29:15] forth herbs
[29:17] meant for them whom in distress re
[29:19] receiveth blessing from god
[29:21] for that which beareth thorns and briars
[29:23] is rejected and is nigh into cursing
[29:25] whose end is to be burned but beloved we
[29:28] are persuaded of better things for you
[29:31] better things better than what
[29:34] better than what
[29:37] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[29:39] of christ
[29:40] of the doctrine of baptism laying on of
[29:43] hands and of the resurrection of the
[29:45] dead and of eternal judgment
[29:47] we are persuaded of
[29:50] more of you than tying up the lucians
[29:55] we are persuaded of better things we are
[29:57] persuaded of perfection for you
[30:01] but beloved we are persuaded better
[30:03] things of you and things that accompany
[30:05] salvation
[30:07] these accompany salvation
[30:10] though we thus speak
[30:13] in the church age book brother branham
[30:14] says so israel came up to the borders of
[30:16] moab and sent messengers to the king
[30:18] saying we are brothers
[30:22] let us pass through your land
[30:24] if our people or our animals eat or
[30:26] drink anything we will gladly pay for it
[30:28] but king balak got very excited that
[30:30] head of the nicolaitan bunch was not
[30:33] about to let that church come through
[30:34] with its signs and its wonders and
[30:37] diverse manifestations of the holy ghost
[30:39] with their faces shining with the glory
[30:43] of god
[30:45] he recognizes what's happening here
[30:49] and he says if they come through i'm
[30:51] going to be wiped out if they come
[30:53] through
[30:55] if they come through i must kill them
[30:56] with the sword
[30:59] he says
[31:01] it was too risky
[31:03] as he might lose some of his crowd
[31:11] they just want to walk through
[31:15] they just want to read the open book
[31:18] they just want to go through the open
[31:19] door out of the church ages and have the
[31:21] fullness of christ
[31:23] and the spirit says it's too risky
[31:26] if i allow them to do that
[31:30] it might affect my group
[31:33] so i now must take the same word
[31:36] the sword of the word
[31:39] and slay them with it
[31:41] brother random says can you imagine
[31:45] believers
[31:46] fighting believers
[31:50] it was too risky as he might lose some
[31:52] of his crowd
[31:54] so balak refused to let israel pass
[31:56] through in fact so great was his fear of
[31:59] them that he went to a hiring prophet
[32:01] called balaam
[32:03] you'll notice brother branham rooted out
[32:04] the cause there
[32:06] his fear of them
[32:09] if he really knew he was okay why is he
[32:12] fearing this people
[32:14] it's so simple but it's so profound look
[32:17] at all the downfall
[32:21] look at all the downfall and the things
[32:23] that he would do
[32:24] instead of just getting himself right
[32:26] with god and taking away the fear
[32:30] he has to go and do all of this
[32:35] spirits don't die
[32:40] in fact so great was his fear of them
[32:42] that he went to a hiring prophet called
[32:44] balaam and asked him to meditate between
[32:46] him and god and petition the almighty to
[32:49] curse israel and to render them in
[32:51] potent and balaam being eager to take
[32:55] part in political affairs and become a
[32:57] great man was only too glad to do it
[33:01] now isn't that just like the nicolaitans
[33:03] we have with us today they curse
[33:06] everyone that won't go their way
[33:12] instead of just dealing with the real
[33:14] cause
[33:16] instead of just instead of your spirit
[33:19] and your flesh
[33:21] humbling itself
[33:23] and realizing it's a mess to begin with
[33:25] and the end is going to be the end it's
[33:28] already been spoken it's going to be
[33:30] done
[33:31] instead of just allowing the word to
[33:33] flow through it
[33:35] it says no i must resist
[33:38] i must not be overcome by this i must
[33:41] kill this power in this life and this
[33:43] source that is that is trying to flow
[33:45] through me
[33:47] it will not just roll over
[33:52] it will not allow free passage
[33:55] but it will struggle and it will fight
[33:59] even when it doesn't make good sense
[34:02] instead of just recognizing
[34:05] instead of just recognizing that if this
[34:08] is allowed if preeminence is allowed
[34:13] why should i fear
[34:16] see it's not your your 16 elements
[34:19] that's concerned about this because
[34:20] remember brother branham says the same
[34:22] 16 elements that you're made out of is
[34:23] what's going to be redeemed
[34:25] you're not going to get a new body
[34:27] you're going to get a redeemed body
[34:28] there's only one thing that's going to
[34:30] leave your body and that's hybridization
[34:35] but it's not just going to leave
[34:38] it's going to have to be
[34:40] went around
[34:42] because if you're wanting to manifest
[34:44] the fullness of the word i'm really
[34:46] getting ahead of myself here but okay
[34:49] if you're really wanting to manifest the
[34:51] fullness of the word in your body
[34:55] you can't kill your body
[35:00] correct you can't demonstrate christ on
[35:04] earth the mystery of god revealed you
[35:05] cannot demonstrate that here on earth if
[35:07] you go out because you're upset with
[35:09] your body it's not obeying what your
[35:10] soul is telling it to do and you hang
[35:12] yourself on a tree now you do not have a
[35:15] body to manifest through you're in
[35:16] another dimension
[35:18] understood
[35:20] but this was the orders that was given
[35:22] to israel even before they confronted
[35:24] them god told him do not fight with moab
[35:27] that's family leave him alone
[35:31] you can't fight with edom it's family
[35:33] leave him alone
[35:36] see if you got rid of your human spirit
[35:38] even though it's hybrid if you got rid
[35:40] of your human spirit
[35:42] what are you going to be
[35:45] remember what happened to nebuchadnezzar
[35:46] god took the spirit of a man out of him
[35:48] put a spirit of an animal in him and he
[35:50] became and started acting like an animal
[35:52] to the point that his body's atoms
[35:55] physically started to change
[35:57] so god has already told israel when they
[35:59] start this battle you can't fight with
[36:00] moab you can't fight with edom
[36:03] so now when they come up and they ask
[36:05] for passage through and it's denied they
[36:07] don't have an option they can't take up
[36:09] the sword against their brother think of
[36:12] the principle saints
[36:14] that's why it's so easy to discern what
[36:16] spirit somebody is of if they want to
[36:18] fight against a believer
[36:21] or even if they want to fight against an
[36:22] unbeliever
[36:24] that fighting spirit is of satan period
[36:30] why do i need to fight against an
[36:32] unbeliever i know who i am
[36:35] why god forbid what i need to fight
[36:38] against a believer
[36:39] even if i just think they're a
[36:40] make-believer
[36:42] why do i need to fight against something
[36:48] that fighting spirit is nothing but
[36:51] satan
[36:52] it comes from the kingdom of satan
[36:56] but this is the principle that god laid
[36:58] out to them you can't fight with moab
[36:59] you can't fight with eden because god
[37:01] knows we can't just go destroy our body
[37:04] he's going to redeem it we can't just go
[37:06] and destroy our human spirit brother man
[37:08] says it'll go and be no more
[37:11] god will deal with those
[37:12] at the appropriate time
[37:14] but now our battle is to bypass those
[37:18] we're still going to the open book we're
[37:21] still going through the open door
[37:24] but we have to bypass the desires and
[37:27] the lust of the flesh and the pride of
[37:29] life and our hybrid spirit realm in
[37:31] order to get there each and every day
[37:36] but the principle of this is i want you
[37:38] to recognize how close it is
[37:42] this is not outside the doors
[37:44] this is not on the seat beside you this
[37:47] is in the seat you're sitting in
[37:50] and if you get distracted and you think
[37:52] the fight is somewhere else you're going
[37:53] to lose your battle and you're not going
[37:56] through an open door and you're not
[37:57] going to be eating an open book
[37:59] you are not going to be manifesting the
[38:01] fullness of christ you ha israel had to
[38:05] recognize the battle for where the
[38:06] battle was at
[38:09] and they had to recognize how god told
[38:11] them to fight that battle and what they
[38:13] were allowed to do and what they were
[38:14] not allowed to do
[38:19] he says
[38:20] there are people who seem to be involved
[38:22] in the things of god almost 100
[38:25] they are like judas
[38:27] no one but jesus knew
[38:30] exactly what kind of a person judas was
[38:33] so the day came that judas did exactly
[38:35] what israel did at bel pior
[38:38] he decided that he wanted to join with
[38:39] the false vine forces to enter into the
[38:42] financial political organization of
[38:45] anti-word antichrist religion and he did
[38:48] so
[38:49] he was fooled
[38:51] the other 11 were not they could not be
[38:53] for they were of the very elect so when
[38:55] judas left and betrayed the lord his
[38:57] name was removed from the book of life
[39:02] now i am sure
[39:04] that you have noticed that those whose
[39:07] names were in the book of life were part
[39:09] of the religious order of that day
[39:12] that centered around the true god
[39:16] and worship of him though they did not
[39:19] worship him according to truth
[39:22] like judas they did not go all the way
[39:26] they did not leave a laodicean condition
[39:29] and get through an open door
[39:31] they did not eat an open book they
[39:34] failed to see the lion come
[39:38] and loose the seals
[39:42] continuing in the in the church age book
[39:44] he says now in spite of the fact that
[39:45] balaam knew the proper approach to god
[39:48] and he could bring forth the rebel
[39:50] revelation from the lord by means of
[39:52] special enduman of power
[39:55] he was still for all of that a bishop in
[39:58] the false group
[40:02] he knew the proper approach to god
[40:05] he could bring forth a revelation from
[40:07] the lord by means of a special enduman
[40:10] of power
[40:12] in spite of all of that he was a bishop
[40:14] in the false group
[40:18] second kings
[40:20] 3 23
[40:23] and they said
[40:24] let me give you just a little bit of a
[40:26] backstory here this is when
[40:28] the three kings
[40:32] moab comes against the three kings i
[40:34] believe the three kings was jehoshaphat
[40:36] of jude of judah
[40:38] ahab of israel and there was one other
[40:41] and it don't come to mind right now
[40:44] but this is a characteristic of moab
[40:47] so when these three king moab comes
[40:49] against these three kings and when these
[40:51] three kings get together they run out of
[40:53] water they call
[40:56] elijah or elisha on the scene god have
[40:58] mercy on me i can't remember which one
[41:00] it was
[41:01] but they called one of the two on the
[41:02] scene and brother chad just touched on
[41:05] this recently and he he told ahab he
[41:07] says if it wasn't for jehoshaphat i
[41:09] wouldn't even talk to you like
[41:11] that's just the way that it is
[41:14] but remember
[41:16] moab's coming against them and at second
[41:18] king
[41:19] kings 3 23 this is after the ditches
[41:22] were made made with water so the
[41:24] children the true children in the valley
[41:27] that moab is coming against they
[41:30] recognize that god has filled these
[41:31] ditches with water and they're they're
[41:33] drinking of it they're using of it but
[41:35] when moab comes up
[41:38] in a high place
[41:40] above the true believers when moab comes
[41:43] up and he looks down it says 323 and
[41:46] they said moab said this is blood
[41:51] the kings are surely slain and they have
[41:54] smitten one another
[41:57] they fought against each other they
[41:59] couldn't get along with each other they
[42:00] fought against each other they killed
[42:02] each other they're all slain and these
[42:04] ditches all down here it's filled with
[42:05] blood and it says moab to the spoil in
[42:09] other words let's go take everything
[42:10] that they got they fought against each
[42:12] other and they lost everything that they
[42:14] had now we're going to go take it
[42:17] but this is a characteristic of moab in
[42:19] the scripture is moab has a false
[42:22] interpretation of what the blood is
[42:26] they see
[42:28] the they see water in ditches that the
[42:31] true believers are drinking
[42:35] they see
[42:37] water
[42:38] of the word
[42:39] that is sustaining the true believers
[42:44] and the true believers know that it's
[42:45] water
[42:47] but when moab comes up and they look
[42:50] down they say that's not water that's
[42:51] blood and they say moab to the spoil
[42:55] so they can't recognize what is blood
[42:59] and what is water
[43:00] they don't have a proper interpretation
[43:02] there
[43:04] brother branham says 1963 christ is the
[43:06] mystery of god revealed the church is
[43:08] the blood of christ
[43:11] the spirit
[43:15] the church is the blood
[43:18] by the spirit
[43:21] you're not going to go to calvary and
[43:22] dig it up
[43:24] and even if you could
[43:27] even though that would be very precious
[43:29] i would never make a comment against
[43:31] that even though that would be very
[43:32] precious if you could get some dna from
[43:36] that blood one speck of that blood
[43:38] it will still not do you any good now
[43:43] it's been shed the life has went out of
[43:45] it and brother branham says that the
[43:47] church is the blood
[43:50] by the spirit
[43:52] moab can't see this
[43:55] because the life is in the blood
[43:58] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[44:00] that baptizes us into the body that
[44:02] recognizes only his body his flesh
[44:06] his word
[44:09] further in the rapture he says one day
[44:13] there will come a blast from heaven
[44:16] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[44:18] them old testament saints back yonder
[44:20] who are waiting will blast forth and
[44:22] come out of there first and go into the
[44:24] resurrection
[44:25] will drop right in line going into the
[44:28] skies these old mortal bodies changed
[44:30] and made like unto his own glorious body
[44:33] what a parade that will be when it
[44:35] starts heavenward
[44:36] some of these days in that rapturing
[44:39] time that lays ahead all proudly
[44:42] displaying the blood of jesus christ
[44:45] upon their chest
[44:47] the message of god in the hour that they
[44:51] lived in
[44:56] but moab can't see that
[44:58] they're too busy believing that those
[45:00] people got fighting amongst themselves
[45:02] like we were like the spirit that's upon
[45:04] us they can't see where the blood's at
[45:08] the true believer knew what it was
[45:10] he knew it was the water of the word for
[45:13] the hour that he lived in
[45:16] the blood of jesus christ upon their
[45:18] chest the message of god
[45:22] in the hour
[45:23] that they lived in
[45:25] jeremiah 48 11 continuing with
[45:27] characteristics of moab
[45:29] moab hath been at ease from his youth
[45:34] and he has settled on his lease
[45:38] again i would venture to say that he
[45:40] failed
[45:41] to keep reaching out
[45:43] in the
[45:44] spirit
[45:46] he's been at ease from his youth
[45:48] he's settled on his lease and hath not
[45:50] been emptied from vessel the vessel
[45:52] neither hath he gone into captivity
[45:55] therefore his tastes remain within him
[45:57] and his scent is not changed jeremiah 48
[46:00] 29 he says we have heard of the pride of
[46:03] moab
[46:04] he is exceedingly
[46:06] proud
[46:10] his loftiness and his arrogancy and his
[46:13] pride and the haughtiness
[46:15] of his heart
[46:17] jeremiah 48 42 and moab shall be
[46:20] destroyed from being a people
[46:23] because he hath magnified himself
[46:26] against the lord
[46:30] why does your hybrid spirit have to go
[46:31] and be no more
[46:33] why does the atoms of your body have to
[46:35] be changed
[46:36] it's because it has magnified itself
[46:39] against the word that is in your soul
[46:43] it is exceedingly proudful
[46:47] it must go
[46:49] fear
[46:51] and the pit
[46:52] and the snare shall be upon the o
[46:55] inhabitant of moab
[46:57] saith the lord
[47:00] that's why you can still get bothered in
[47:01] your spirit realm and that's why your
[47:03] flesh can still have diseases
[47:05] because fear and the pit and the snare
[47:07] is all that's promise promised to that
[47:09] realm
[47:12] anything that would resist that word
[47:14] that is in your heart
[47:16] there is nothing good spoke of it
[47:22] i have searched through the scriptures
[47:24] and if i'm wrong somebody come and
[47:25] correct me i'm willing to do that but
[47:27] i've searched through the scriptures and
[47:28] i cannot find one good thing that god
[47:32] ever says about moab
[47:34] not one
[47:36] not even that you're a good adversary
[47:39] i can find
[47:41] nothing complimentary
[47:43] that god says
[47:45] ever
[47:47] ever
[47:48] for moab
[47:58] deuteronomy 34 6
[48:02] speaking of moses
[48:04] and he buried him
[48:07] in a valley meaning god buried him and
[48:09] he buried him in a valley
[48:11] in the land of moab
[48:14] over against beth pior
[48:17] but no man knoweth of his sepulcher unto
[48:20] this day
[48:22] so moses the very one that god
[48:25] supernaturally moved for
[48:30] that was the leader of the true
[48:32] believers
[48:35] that came up
[48:37] and broke the word of god by smiting the
[48:39] rock twice
[48:41] god takes them up on the mountain he
[48:42] says look at the promised land it's a
[48:44] good land moses says yep it's there god
[48:46] says you're not going because you broke
[48:48] my word
[48:49] you
[48:50] magnified yourself instead of me
[48:57] moab
[48:59] moab spirit was so profound and so
[49:02] powerful
[49:04] that it got on the one that even led the
[49:06] true believer out
[49:08] to the point that he would magnify
[49:11] himself
[49:12] instead of god
[49:18] and he buried him in the valley in the
[49:20] land of moab
[49:21] over against beth pior
[49:24] now we're going to see why it was why
[49:27] moab was so
[49:28] important because moab in the country of
[49:32] moab right over against where the
[49:34] children of israel would exit moab and
[49:36] go into the promised land here is the
[49:38] city of beth pior
[49:41] and this moab
[49:43] moab in all its fallen condition
[49:46] still contained
[49:48] contained beth pior
[49:50] beth pure means the house
[49:53] of the opening
[49:56] moses was buried
[49:59] at the house of the opening
[50:01] this is why moab
[50:03] whether they knew what they were doing
[50:04] or whether they didn't this is why moab
[50:06] couldn't let israel come through
[50:10] because moab is directly
[50:13] right beside
[50:16] the promised land and if the children of
[50:18] israel get through moab they're through
[50:20] the open door
[50:22] they are literally through the house of
[50:24] the open door
[50:26] there's nothing stopping them now
[50:29] they've been caught up they've been
[50:31] raptured up
[50:35] beth pior was in moab
[50:38] and this is where moses
[50:41] was buried
[50:45] moses was buried there
[50:47] because he magnified himself
[50:51] he yielded
[50:52] to the lust of the flesh the pride of
[50:55] life and the lust of the ice
[50:57] he yielded
[50:59] to a spirit that was not like christ and
[51:01] he magnified that spirit over the word
[51:04] of god
[51:05] and god
[51:07] took him
[51:08] and he buried him
[51:10] right at the open door
[51:15] that was the outcome of moses
[51:17] who god spoke lip to ear
[51:20] with do you think he's going to cut us
[51:23] any slack
[51:26] do you think he's going to
[51:28] allow us to come back any other way
[51:31] every word of god
[51:33] complete death to self
[51:36] complete death to self
[51:39] look at everything that moses did i
[51:42] would venture to say that if you waste
[51:44] if you weighed his good against his bad
[51:47] they would probably
[51:48] beat us
[51:50] probably all of us combined
[51:53] but it would probably definitely be each
[51:55] of us as an individual his good
[51:58] to his bad but when he magnified himself
[52:01] over one word of god god took him and he
[52:03] buried him right by the open door
[52:06] he says you can't go through
[52:08] you can never go through an open door
[52:10] with one speck of glow to see in on you
[52:13] with that laodicean spirit it cannot get
[52:16] through the open door not one speck of
[52:19] it
[52:21] no jealousy no pride no fighting
[52:26] none of that
[52:28] god wouldn't permit it for moses he's
[52:29] certainly not going to permit it for us
[52:35] god buried him at the house of the open
[52:37] door
[52:39] now i told you
[52:41] that in review of the scripture
[52:44] i could not find one thing god had to
[52:46] say good about moab
[52:48] and that is true
[52:51] but
[52:53] there is the book of ruth
[52:57] in the book of ruth is a very beautiful
[52:59] picture there how that boaz the type of
[53:02] christ how that naomi went over into a
[53:04] strange country moab
[53:07] as a backsliding
[53:10] so she left her home country and she
[53:12] went into moab and brother brandon said
[53:14] she backslid
[53:16] think of naomi naomi went there with her
[53:18] son her two sons and her husband
[53:21] she went there she was hungry
[53:24] naturally hungry and they had bread in
[53:26] moab so she went there with her sons and
[53:28] her two husband
[53:30] and the natural cravings of her stomach
[53:34] cost her everything
[53:37] because when she came back she had
[53:40] nothing she had lost her husband and she
[53:42] had lost her two sons
[53:45] and one of her daughter-in-laws
[53:49] all
[53:50] for the lust of the flesh
[53:53] carnal eating carnal bread natural bread
[53:57] brother bryan says she left where she
[53:58] was supposed to be she went to moab she
[54:00] backslid and the scripture says when she
[54:03] comes back she has nothing
[54:07] i would venture to say it would have
[54:08] been better to die in the homeland
[54:12] i would venture to say that it would
[54:13] have been better just to die trusting in
[54:15] god
[54:16] because if you ever go into moab
[54:20] it'll take everything that you had
[54:24] if you ever
[54:25] get out of that open door you're going
[54:27] to lose everything that you've gained
[54:30] it the world will take it all
[54:33] don't ever ever leave the open door
[54:38] brother brandon says revelation to a
[54:40] true believer can never be
[54:42] overemphasized that's why i'm preaching
[54:44] this tonight that's what i'm preaching
[54:46] is the importance of revelation the
[54:48] importance of getting out of
[54:51] remember the laodicean is not just a
[54:53] church age it's not just a city it's a
[54:55] condition it's a spirit
[54:59] getting out of a low to see in condition
[55:01] through an open door and the only way
[55:03] you can do that is complete death to
[55:05] self
[55:12] if you don't go through that open door
[55:16] even though the loose ends may be sweet
[55:18] in your mouth you're going to lose them
[55:22] you will lose everything that god has
[55:26] revealed to you if you don't go through
[55:28] that open door
[55:30] the scripture says
[55:33] when a man is given something if he
[55:35] don't do something with it god will take
[55:37] that back away from him
[55:41] that's not verbatim but you know the
[55:42] scripture that i'm referring to
[55:45] he has to keep reaching out in the
[55:47] spirit he has to get through the open
[55:49] door
[55:51] naomi backslid
[55:53] she went out of the land and brought
[55:55] back out of the country of moab she was
[55:57] a moabite
[55:59] referring to ruth now
[56:02] and brought back out of the country of
[56:04] moab
[56:05] she was a moabite
[56:07] absolutely a picture of the gentile
[56:10] bride
[56:12] so
[56:13] here's a paradox you can have the
[56:16] entirety of the scripture and not one
[56:18] good thing said about moab nothing
[56:23] but out of that
[56:25] think of yourself now remember it's not
[56:28] out there
[56:29] not one ounce of this is out there this
[56:31] is here
[56:35] there is nothing good you can say about
[56:37] yourself
[56:39] you can search and you can search and
[56:40] you can search and you're not going to
[56:42] find it but out of that god somehow
[56:46] is still capable to pull a roof
[56:51] to pull the roof that brother brandon
[56:52] says is absolutely a perfect type of the
[56:54] gentile bride and naomi had told her she
[56:57] had kissed her and told her to go back
[56:59] to her people and she said i will go
[57:01] with your people let your people be my
[57:03] people and let your dwelling be my
[57:05] dwelling that your god be my god and
[57:08] nothing but death shall separate us
[57:10] where you die i die where you are buried
[57:13] i'll be buried now there is a picture of
[57:16] the gentile church coming into christ
[57:19] what is a picture
[57:21] of the gentile church coming into christ
[57:25] i will go with your people
[57:28] i will go with the word
[57:32] the word will be my people
[57:34] the dwelling of the word will be my
[57:36] dwelling
[57:38] the god of the word will be my god
[57:42] nothing but death
[57:44] shall separate me in this dimension from
[57:46] that word
[57:48] where that word is buried i will be
[57:51] buried
[57:52] brother branham says now there
[57:54] is a picture of the gentile church
[57:56] coming into christ
[57:58] death
[57:59] utter death
[58:01] to self
[58:03] ruth completely
[58:04] died to naomi
[58:09] because we were once aliens away from
[58:11] god only the jews was the ones to be
[58:13] saved but we being dead in christ
[58:16] take on abraham's seed and our heirs
[58:19] according to the promise
[58:22] i've already been an hour
[58:24] and i kept you way too long the last
[58:26] wednesday that i preached and i promise
[58:27] i won't do that
[58:30] so we're going to go through the rest of
[58:31] this real quick and we're going to wrap
[58:33] up but just stay with me can you give me
[58:34] 10 15 minutes
[58:37] there's a lot more here but i'm not
[58:39] going to do that
[58:42] this is speaking
[58:46] of esther esther 2 verse 18.
[58:50] it says then the king made a great feast
[58:52] into all of his princes and to his
[58:54] servants even esther's feast so this is
[58:56] after esther has been chosen and the
[58:58] king says i'm going i'm happy about this
[59:00] i'm going to make a feast
[59:03] even esther's face and he made a release
[59:05] to the provinces and gave gifts
[59:07] according to the state of the king
[59:09] so he marries esther he's happy he has a
[59:12] great feast and he gives gifts to
[59:14] everybody
[59:15] and then
[59:16] and when the virgins were gathered
[59:18] together the second time
[59:20] then mordecai is set in the king's gate
[59:22] so he's thrilled with esther he's super
[59:24] happy
[59:25] and then he wants another virgin so i'm
[59:28] not sure how that works but that's what
[59:30] the king did
[59:33] but there's been a first pull
[59:36] and esther's been chosen
[59:39] and there's been a second pull
[59:41] and all the women's been all the virgins
[59:43] all the churches have been invited
[59:45] you follow me
[59:47] and after this second pull is made there
[59:50] is a position that changes and mordecai
[59:52] is not wandering around in the courtyard
[59:54] anymore he's not wandering around
[59:55] outside the wall mordecai is in the
[59:57] king's gate
[1:00:01] i would venture to say that now mordecai
[1:00:03] is setting right before the open door
[1:00:05] after this second poll
[1:00:08] and esther had not yet been completely
[1:00:11] revealed it says esther had not yet
[1:00:13] showed her kindred nor her people as
[1:00:14] mordecai charged her for esther did the
[1:00:17] commandment of mordecai like is when she
[1:00:18] was brought up with him and in those
[1:00:20] days meaning between the after the first
[1:00:23] pull and after the second poll but after
[1:00:25] but before the third pole and mordecai
[1:00:28] is in the in the king's gate he's at the
[1:00:30] opening of the king
[1:00:32] in those days
[1:00:34] while mordecai set in the king's gate
[1:00:36] two of the king's chamberlain's bigtha
[1:00:40] and tarish of those which kept the door
[1:00:45] their keepers of the door
[1:00:48] were wrath
[1:00:51] and sought to lay hands on the king
[1:00:56] after the second poll but before the
[1:00:58] third pull
[1:01:00] when the messenger
[1:01:01] is right at the open door
[1:01:05] there's two that raise up
[1:01:07] and the wrath with the word
[1:01:09] the wrath
[1:01:10] with the king
[1:01:12] why i have no idea the scripture doesn't
[1:01:14] say brother branham doesn't say
[1:01:16] this is just me if you allow me this
[1:01:18] thought
[1:01:20] remember these are the king's
[1:01:22] chamberlain's the keeper of the door
[1:01:24] there's only two people behind that door
[1:01:25] the king and esther
[1:01:29] maybe these men had virgins that weren't
[1:01:31] chosen
[1:01:34] if the spirit holds true
[1:01:36] the spirit of mohab
[1:01:38] if the spirit of mohabs holds true
[1:01:40] that's exactly what it was now again
[1:01:41] that's just me i could be a million
[1:01:43] miles wrong
[1:01:45] but there's something that they were
[1:01:47] jealous of there was something that they
[1:01:48] were wroth with the king these are the
[1:01:51] king's chamberlains
[1:01:53] remember there's the king
[1:01:55] there's esther and then there's these
[1:01:57] two guys
[1:01:59] what have they got to be upset about
[1:02:03] there's only one thing they could be
[1:02:04] upset about and that's the relationship
[1:02:06] between the king and the queen
[1:02:09] that's all that's there there's no other
[1:02:11] people there
[1:02:13] it's the king and the queen
[1:02:16] and the keepers of the
[1:02:18] door get roth
[1:02:21] about something whatever that is
[1:02:27] and the thing was known to mordecai
[1:02:30] because remember mordecai's mordecai's
[1:02:32] not outside wandering around anymore
[1:02:34] mordecai is sitting right at the open
[1:02:36] door
[1:02:38] and the thing was known to mordecai and
[1:02:40] he told it to the bride
[1:02:44] he told it to esther the queen
[1:02:47] and esther the queen certified the king
[1:02:49] thereof in mordecai's name she said that
[1:02:51] man's message is correct
[1:02:56] to the king
[1:02:58] she's now vouching for mordecai
[1:03:01] to the king
[1:03:03] and the the queen all she has to say is
[1:03:06] that man's message is correct
[1:03:11] and when inquisition was made of the
[1:03:14] matter it was found out
[1:03:17] and therefore
[1:03:19] so when they went and they searched it
[1:03:20] out they found out yes that is true
[1:03:23] therefore they were both hanged on a
[1:03:26] tree the two the the two that was
[1:03:28] keeping the door
[1:03:32] they were both hanged on a tree
[1:03:34] and it was written in the book of the
[1:03:35] chronicles before the king
[1:03:39] why is that scripture in there
[1:03:44] it doesn't even take the time to say
[1:03:46] what they were mad about
[1:03:47] but it lays a scripture in there between
[1:03:50] the second and the third pole when the
[1:03:52] when the when mordecai the one that put
[1:03:55] the queen in her position when he is
[1:03:57] right before the open door now
[1:04:00] there's two that keep that door
[1:04:03] that gets rough
[1:04:04] why is that scripture in there
[1:04:06] because there's always two keeping the
[1:04:08] door there was moab and there was edom
[1:04:12] that was keeping beth pure
[1:04:14] there's these two king these two
[1:04:16] chamberlains
[1:04:18] but it goes way back beyond that
[1:04:20] because how many was trying to keep
[1:04:22] abraham from the promised land
[1:04:25] his daddy and his nephew
[1:04:30] when he got them finally out of the way
[1:04:34] how many was trying to keep him two
[1:04:37] sarah
[1:04:39] his own wife
[1:04:40] and hagar
[1:04:42] remember that was before her name was
[1:04:43] changed
[1:04:45] but his father and lot tried to keep him
[1:04:48] from the promised land
[1:04:50] his own wife and hagar
[1:04:53] came up with a scheme to try to produce
[1:04:55] the promised son without
[1:04:57] the proper will of god
[1:05:01] you go down through the family of
[1:05:02] abraham and he sends eliezer to go get a
[1:05:04] bride for isaac
[1:05:07] and he finds rebecca
[1:05:10] and rebecca
[1:05:13] you read in the scripture and laban and
[1:05:17] i believe it was nahor but don't hold me
[1:05:19] to that no
[1:05:20] uh laban and bethel or something along
[1:05:23] that lines it's the father of rebecca
[1:05:26] and her uncle
[1:05:27] eliezer comes and says this is what i
[1:05:30] prayed and this is what god did like i
[1:05:32] prayed this that the damsel would do x y
[1:05:34] and z and she came and she did x y and z
[1:05:36] and i never said anything to her and the
[1:05:38] father and the uncle said well
[1:05:40] god's clearly with you how can we say
[1:05:42] anything take her and go
[1:05:44] duh
[1:05:46] but
[1:05:48] it says that the mother and the brother
[1:05:52] the mother and the brother of rebecca
[1:05:55] eliezer gave great gifts to
[1:05:59] he had already given them great
[1:06:02] gifts so when the mother and the brother
[1:06:05] get time to chime in they say oh no
[1:06:07] don't let her go right now
[1:06:09] don't let her go to the promised son
[1:06:11] right now wait at least 10 days
[1:06:15] the father and the uncle say god is
[1:06:17] clearly with you take her and go
[1:06:19] god speed but the one that he had given
[1:06:22] great gifts to
[1:06:24] said no don't go yet don't go through
[1:06:27] the open door yet don't eat of the open
[1:06:29] book yet
[1:06:30] stay in this condition that you're at
[1:06:32] right now just for a little bit just for
[1:06:34] a little bit longer you can serve god
[1:06:36] with all of your heart a little bit but
[1:06:37] for right now just for today just just
[1:06:39] wait for a second not a full commitment
[1:06:41] yet
[1:06:44] there's only one thing that would
[1:06:46] motivate that mother and that brother to
[1:06:48] not tell her tell her
[1:06:51] the same thing that the dad and the
[1:06:52] uncle did there is only one thing is
[1:06:54] that is they wanted more gifts
[1:06:58] they wanted more gifts there is no other
[1:07:00] motivation
[1:07:03] instead of getting her out the open door
[1:07:06] and getting her into the promised land
[1:07:07] it was more important to the mother and
[1:07:09] the brother to get more gifts and have
[1:07:12] more manifestations on themselves
[1:07:16] the dad and the uncle said god is
[1:07:18] clearly with you
[1:07:19] go
[1:07:22] but remember how many resisted
[1:07:25] two
[1:07:26] you look at moses how many resisted
[1:07:28] moses in egypt as the musicians come how
[1:07:30] many resisted moses in egypt
[1:07:33] two janice and jamers
[1:07:38] skip all the way over to the book of
[1:07:40] revelation because i'm out of time
[1:07:43] how many is resisting the bride
[1:07:46] is it
[1:07:47] 1 million horsemen
[1:07:50] 3 million horsemen
[1:07:54] 2 million horsemen
[1:07:56] why is it two million horsemen why
[1:07:58] wouldn't a million horsemen suffice i
[1:08:00] mean that is a lot
[1:08:02] or if you're gonna not just send a
[1:08:04] million why not send three million why
[1:08:06] two
[1:08:10] let's
[1:08:11] go all the way back to the
[1:08:13] beginning now
[1:08:17] and how many resisted the true believer
[1:08:19] in heaven
[1:08:21] how many was it that fell
[1:08:24] two-thirds
[1:08:26] two-thirds fell
[1:08:29] two-thirds resisted the truth
[1:08:34] why did two-thirds resist the
[1:08:36] truth why wasn't it
[1:08:39] five-eighths
[1:08:41] why was why was it two-thirds why was it
[1:08:43] two million
[1:08:45] why was it two in egypt why was it two
[1:08:48] constantly plaguing abraham why was it
[1:08:50] two that came against the two children
[1:08:52] of the true children of egypt when they
[1:08:54] were just trying to get through the open
[1:08:55] door
[1:08:56] why
[1:08:59] because it's always true with you
[1:09:03] your soul will always be resisted by
[1:09:07] your hybrid spirit and your hybrid flesh
[1:09:11] always
[1:09:13] it was the battle that began in heaven
[1:09:15] that spilled over and became human
[1:09:17] battles and it's the battle that rages
[1:09:19] on now
[1:09:21] as we stand together look at the spirits
[1:09:24] behind it
[1:09:25] look at the tactics behind it
[1:09:31] look at the spirit behind the battle
[1:09:35] look at the tactics
[1:09:37] behind the battle
[1:09:40] and don't make the mistake of putting
[1:09:42] that battle too far away
[1:09:47] that battle's in your chair
[1:09:51] that battle is in your mirror
[1:09:53] it's in my chair it's in my mirror
[1:09:56] it's not outside these doors
[1:09:58] it's not in the person beside of you
[1:10:01] this has been the pattern from the
[1:10:03] beginning the pattern will not fail
[1:10:06] there is nothing good to say about moab
[1:10:09] not one thing
[1:10:10] but out of that
[1:10:12] god will place the word in your soul
[1:10:16] and he'll bring a gentile broad out of
[1:10:17] that
[1:10:19] there is nothing good to say about moab
[1:10:22] there's nothing good to say about these
[1:10:24] two million horsemen there's nothing
[1:10:27] good
[1:10:28] to say about the two that resisted
[1:10:31] abraham and the two that resisted
[1:10:33] um moses
[1:10:35] there's nothing good to say about the
[1:10:37] two that kept the door to the king
[1:10:40] there in the days of esther
[1:10:43] nothing good they both hung on a tree
[1:10:45] and cursed it is he that hangeth on a
[1:10:47] tree
[1:10:49] there is nothing good that we can say
[1:10:51] about ourselves but out of that god will
[1:10:54] pick up a word in your soul and manifest
[1:10:58] it through your hybrid flesh and through
[1:11:00] your hybrid spirit
[1:11:01] and he will have a bride and perfection
[1:11:04] you don't have to take the sword to it
[1:11:09] paul says that he beat himself black and
[1:11:11] blue
[1:11:12] paul wasn't out with a stick every day
[1:11:14] hitting himself
[1:11:15] paul was fighting a spiritual warfare of
[1:11:19] death to self
[1:11:21] resisting all the spirits and all the
[1:11:23] tactics of the enemy
[1:11:25] and completely dying to himself he was
[1:11:27] beating himself black and blue blue in a
[1:11:30] spiritual sense
[1:11:32] he was constantly bringing himself under
[1:11:35] subjection of the word because even
[1:11:37] paul's flesh and even paul's spirit says
[1:11:39] you're not coming through here
[1:11:42] and we're not going to support you and
[1:11:44] if you try we're going to do everything
[1:11:45] we can to resist you to the point that
[1:11:47] we will fight you with the sword of the
[1:11:49] word
[1:11:51] we will try to confuse you in the word
[1:11:53] if we have to and even if that don't
[1:11:56] work we'll try another tactic and we'll
[1:11:57] get you to fall
[1:12:02] matthew 23 12 as we close
[1:12:06] whosoever
[1:12:08] shall exalt himself
[1:12:10] shall be a beast
[1:12:16] it's not optional
[1:12:18] whosoever
[1:12:20] shall exalt himself
[1:12:23] shall be a beast
[1:12:25] and he that shall humble himself
[1:12:28] shall be exalted
[1:12:30] if one is true the other is true
[1:12:34] but woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:12:37] hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of
[1:12:38] heaven against men
[1:12:40] for ye neither go in yourselves
[1:12:43] neither suffer ye them
[1:12:45] that are entering to go in
[1:12:48] that is the battle cry every day of your
[1:12:51] hybridization
[1:12:53] i'm not going in
[1:12:55] and i'm going to try to keep you from
[1:12:56] going in
[1:12:57] let's recognize the spirit let's
[1:12:59] recognize the tactics let's die to
[1:13:02] two-thirds of ourself
[1:13:05] and let the one that has not fallen
[1:13:07] the only good thing about us
[1:13:10] that word and our soul have the
[1:13:11] preeminence because brother branham says
[1:13:14] revelation to a true believer can never
[1:13:17] be overemphasized
[1:13:20] let that word in your soul get through
[1:13:22] the open door
[1:13:24] and don't look back
[1:13:26] let it eat from an open book
[1:13:28] regardless of who would try to fight
[1:13:30] against that
[1:13:32] remember it says
[1:13:35] you shut up the kingdom of heaven
[1:13:38] against men
[1:13:40] where are we going saints
[1:13:42] we're going to the kingdom of heaven we
[1:13:45] are the walking kingdom of heaven
[1:13:47] but there's going to be those
[1:13:50] spirits
[1:13:52] spirits
[1:13:55] that is going to resist that and they're
[1:13:57] not wanting to go in
[1:13:59] themselves
[1:14:00] and they do not want to suffer you to go
[1:14:02] in
[1:14:04] spirits don't die
[1:14:07] the man does but spirits
[1:14:09] don't die
[1:14:12] that's why there's just as strong today
[1:14:14] as they were back then
[1:14:16] and that's what they want to do
[1:14:18] i think you've got my point let's pray
[1:14:21] precious lord jesus we just want to
[1:14:24] thank you once again for this time that
[1:14:26] you've given us father and we just pray
[1:14:29] that you would take the words that's
[1:14:31] been spoken and you would make them a

[1:14:35] them a reality to me father
[1:14:38] let us truly
[1:14:40] recognize how close this battle is
[1:14:44] let us recognize by what we can see
[1:14:48] externally in the signs of the times
[1:14:51] pointing us
[1:14:53] to what phase of the battle that we're
[1:14:54] in lord and may we truly recognize that
[1:14:57] this is not a far off battle lord that
[1:15:00] this is the closing moments of the of
[1:15:03] the battle this is the closing times of
[1:15:05] the battle and the battle is right in us
[1:15:08] father
[1:15:10] and we must resist with everything that
[1:15:12] we have
[1:15:13] to be an overcomer and to leave this
[1:15:16] dimension
[1:15:17] father i pray as we would commit
[1:15:19] ourselves to you tonight that you would
[1:15:20] just be with us

[1:15:49] that's here tonight by way of sending us
[1:15:52] a true prophet lord
[1:15:54] you sent us a true gift of a true
[1:15:56] prophet to break your word to us lord to
[1:15:59] use that vessel and loose the seals of
[1:16:02] the book father you have given us the
[1:16:04] greatest gift father and you have

[1:16:09] to where we can walk in full truth
[1:16:12] that we can rapture up lord through an
[1:16:14] open door
[1:16:16] that we can eat and read of an open book
[1:16:19] lord may we not take that for granted
[1:16:21] father
[1:16:23] but may we go in lord full force
[1:16:27] lord may we go in with such force that
[1:16:29] we would pull somebody with us
[1:16:32] may we be a living walking bible
[1:16:35] fullness of the word of god
