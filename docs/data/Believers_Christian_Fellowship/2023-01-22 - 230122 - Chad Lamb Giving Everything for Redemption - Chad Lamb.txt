you've promised to be wherever two or three are gathered in your name now Lord we want you to take preeminence Among Us and find welcome in our hearts we love you Lord when we look into your word we pray God that you would open the word to us give us eyes to see and ears to hear all that you have for us in this hour may we grow by the things that you share with us today may we eat from your hand and grow we love you Lord and ask that you would take this vessel under your control for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while you're standing you can turn your Bibles to the book of Philippians we'll get started in the word Philippians chapter 3 together and verse 4 Philippians chapter 3 and verse 4. though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteous righteousness which is in the law blameness but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yea doubtle us and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ amen God bless you as you take your seats well it's called the bless us as we look at his word this is a passage of scripture we know really quite well but the Apostle Paul here is starting to talk about you know some of the things that were in his past life that would give him confidence maybe some of the things that were either privileged positions or accomplishments uh in his own life and he started sharing that but but he says that he counted it all but lost it encountered it all but done that he might win Christ for him it was worth the loss of his reputation it was worth the loss of his Prestige or his position or his privilege the the wind Christ was worth the loss of all of that and we know Paul was called names Paul was chased Paul was beat Paul was he had all of these difficulties I mean we don't even know some of the details in his life the rejection may be in his own family uh maybe siblings or parents or or who knows extended family the rejection that he went through the old friends that separated from him we don't know what it cost him but one thing we know for sure is it cost him it cost him but he he thought the cost was worth it amen and Paul redeemed the the the the to win Christ worth the loss of it all he says verse 17 but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yea doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ Paul wasn't trying to hold on to his life and have Christ he wasn't trying to keep one foot in Both Worlds at the same time in the church world and in Christ so that he could go to whichever one's convenient or glean the benefits from both you understand what I'm saying but he made a commitment and he made a decision and he moved amen everything that he had and everything he was he moved into one path and that was towards Christ and in doing so he lost everything else and for him it was worth it and so yeah this morning there's just a lot of thoughts in my heart a lot of things that I've been dwelling on in usually you know we'll think of a title or some title and I know people like to write a title but I have no idea the title amen I'm sorry for that I just and you know you do this hundreds and hundreds of times and things but today I'm so full and we're just going to trust God I'm just going to relax myself and and drop into another channel into another gear and just let God flow amen and whatever he wants to do he'll do and at the end whatever we think we should call it we'll call it that amen and you can call it something on your paper and I may call it something different on mine but it's the word of God Amen in the message influence brother Adam said God is only trying to find one person he can get his get in his hands he has always tried to do that you notice all down through the Bible when he found in Isaiah when he found a Jeremiah when he found a Samson one day but Samson gave his strength to God but he gave his heart to Delilah see you've got to give your all to God your reverence your respects your everything that you are just be nothing just see how little you are and that's what God wants us to do and that's real humility amen real humility is just to give your all to God Amen real humility is not to act humble and and you know I'm not really preaching on humility but it's a theme that pops up and what we're looking at uh real humility there's a false humility and a false humility is a false a basing of yourself and making comments about well I'm nothing and you know that I'm nothing and I and and I'm no good anyways and and but you know that may be true and that may be genuine humility you really view yourself that way but if you you say those things but yet there's parts of your life you're not surrendering to the word you're actually not humble you're proud because real humility is a submission to the word of God when you recognize that there's nothing I think of value but the word has all the value amen my ideas are not valuable real humility is a proper placing of yourself so real humility is not saying self-abasing statements you can say those statements and not be humble at all but genuine humility is not about the self-abasing statements genuine genuine humility is about an absolute understanding of where you stand in the program of God and that you and I'm talking you on The Human Side now I'm talking the natural side that in you is no good thing in in your thinking your understanding your Concepts your feelings they are all utterly failed they will they're they're contrary many times to the things of God cannot be red light upon cannot be trusted so I will surrender all of this for the word and then subject myself to the word that's true humility even if you don't make all the self-abasing statements even if you don't walk around saying I'm no good and I'm nothing and and I can't do anything right I mean you you don't have to say any of that humility is a is a full surrender to God amen and so that's just part of what we want to look at but I want to go to the Book of Esther now if we could go to Esther chapter one and we've preached so much on Esther but I still think there's more to preach I don't know I think the word of God is layered and eternal and will never come to the end of it amen Esther chapter 1 and I want to read verse 5 and then jump over to 10 I just want to set a background here as we move forward but in uh Esther chapter 1 verse 5 and when these days were expired the king made a feast into all the people that were present in shushan the palace both under the Great and Small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's Palace so he has a seven-day feast and the seven day Feast is is in the court of the palace and let's jump over to verse 10. and on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine he commanded mehuman and bistha and harbona and big and abagatha zether and carcass the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of hazarus the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princess her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vastly refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very Roth in his anger burned in him so we see that that now we come to the end we we have a seven day Feast which is a type of the seven Church ages and and on the seventh day of The Seventh-Day Feast amen he sends seven chamberlains amen which are which are the seven uh let's type that as the seven Messengers The Seven Angels amen and when we saw that cloud all seven were in the cloud amen so on the seventh day he sends the seven chamberlains amen or or we look at it this way in fullness these sins the seven chamberlains to come and bring vashti the queen and then vashti is a type of the the denominational Church world and vashti refuses to come to the king and the seventh day of this great feast which is exactly where we are in time Amen in the seventh Church age God has sent all seven chamberlains after amen his church after the bride amen but the formal Church refused refused and so let's go to chapter 2 verse 1. chapter 2 verse 1. after these things when the Wrath of the King azerus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shusha and the palace to the house of the women and to the custody of hege the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them and let the women which pleases the king be Queen instead of ashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so so we're so very familiar with this story we won't go into great detail but now he sends out servants and those servants are out there to gather all the fair young virgins and it just goes to show that many are called but few are chosen and they're coming in at the time Amen to replace vashti the whole point is the church the formal denominational church has turned down the call of the king in the seventh day but now they're saying go get virgins amen those that are undefiled go get Fair young virgins and he sent the servants out to call The Virgins and now there was going to be a purification process and at the end of the purification process there's going to be a presentation to the king and the king is going to make his selection the one that pleases him is the one that he's going to choose and now we we've got the whole stage set for our life for where we are amen because we we know that we're in the day that the formal church has refused the call of the king in the seventh day the seven chamberlains have come the seven spirits of God have come amen the message through seven Church ages has come amen and she has refused but God is is looking for that one that he's going to call bride and so now they were gathering the fair young virgins but there was a purpose in the Gathering he was looking for a queen he was looking for his Queen amen the vashti thought she was Queen but she she Dishonored herself and was not worthy of that title amen and now the king is looking for a queen he's looking for a bride he's looking for a wife so this whole process is about him looking for a wife now let's go to verse 12. now in every maid's turn was come to go into king ahazarus after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purification accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh in six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women then thus came every Maiden into the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women into the King's house and in the evening in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shash gas the king's Chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she recalled by name now when the turn of Esther the daughter of ABBA Hale the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so Esther was taken into King azerus into his house Royal in the tenth month which is the month tibeth in the seventh year of his Reign and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashti and the King made a great feast unto all the princes and his servants even Esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king all right there's so many things in here that I want to talk about that we have talked about and I'm sure as we read through this your mind is being pricked of all the things that we've drawn out of this in the past but I want to I want to take a look at this and show where we're at because when when when these fairy young virgins are called like I said many are called if you were chosen here are many are called amen but one is going to be chosen and now it becomes uh that this is kind of a Do or Die situation they're all gathered together and and you know I don't know if the Gathering was of their free choice or against their free choice I I don't know what it was that day but but you can imagine when the decree goes out that the that the king is looking for another queen and all the fairy on virgins should come you can imagine how many people were standing first in line for that how many young virgins in the Kingdom wanted to be in that call amen wanted to go and and wanted to be wanted to have her chance to become the next Queen and so they were sent messages sent out they were gathered to shushan the Palace they were given to the custody of haggy the king's Chamberlain which is a servant of the king and that King that King's Chamberlain now is appointing them the things that they need for purification because they can't go straight to the king until they first been purified amen and gone through our haggy eye amen through through brother Branham has given the water of the word for purification to purify us to come to the union with the King amen so they go through a purification process and and this is a 12-month process and as they're going through that I don't know exactly what what Hagee I was telling them but he was giving them the appointments and the instructions and everything that they needed for purification and I'm sure he was giving them instruction even to approaching the king and etiquette and procedure and because these women were gathered from throughout the the kingdom they weren't raised in Royal palaces they weren't raised in shushan the palace they were gathered from the kingdom so no doubt he's giving instruction on an approach to the king the proper Approach To The King and conduct and Order and Doctrine amen you got it so now they're going through this process but but as they're going through the process they all know that only one only one is going to be the queen and and you know how the Apostle Paul says we all run in a race but not run as one that's untrained or undisciplined but I run that I may obtain the pride all run but one gets the prize so run the race therefore that you might obtain the prize Paul is giving this instruction amen that that there's going to be if there's only going to be one person get the trophy that day you run the race like you're the one who's going to get the trophy amen and he's tying that to serving Christ amen and that's how Paul served Christ he gave up everything else and he was going to get a hold of Christ and hold on to Christ regardless if demons forsake Him regardless if he was going to be stoned or chased by the Jews or rejected by his countrymen he was going to he was going to have Christ regardless of what else he had to lose is that right so so and he's instructing us run the race amen run the race to win the race don't run the race to be in the race uh I I just I hope I just pray God help me to relax myself and just let it flow amen it's not to say I'm in church or I'm in the message or or I'm I'm following after the ministry of William Branham you run this race to be the bride amen not to be in church not to be in the message not to be associated with Ruth right amen we've got the we've got to run differently amen this isn't a church race this isn't a church walk this isn't a social event amen this is my opportunity to come in contact with the King and be chosen to be his bride like this is do or die this is all or nothing this is halfway is no good so many women I don't know how many women there was 127 provinces if they took one from every Province it'd be 127. if they took a few from every Prophet I don't know how they selected that but there was a number of women and you know you know Human Nature I mean you live in it you're surrounded by it if you're not awakened to it just open your eyes it's all around you you take that many Fair young virgins who all have one chance to be the the queen and I wonder if there was any competition I wonder if there was any jealousy I wonder if there's any Strife I wonder if there was any gossip probably not these were all perfect people you know I wonder if there's anybody trying to get an advantage over another I wonder if all these very young virgins who had the Ultimate Prize to win do you know what second place was The House of the concubine where they all got stuck and maybe never ever ever come into the presence of the King again so it it's not yeah we're all going to be happy we're all gonna we're gonna see the king together no one of them was they were all going to see the king but one of them was going to be chosen one of them and so now you can see how how when it comes to uh the appointments for purification the instructions of haggai you can see how critical it was to pay attention to what he was saying to listen and and and try to understand and when he goes through the purification you want to be there in the purification process you may be one of first one done right I'd like to be the first one done I want to be the first one to go in I want to get extra credit I want to set the state no I don't want to go first because you know first you can't make his decision I want to come somewhere in the middle can you imagine all the scheming that was going on and I'm sure haggai was buttered up to more than any other human being on the face of the Earth at that period of time he had 12 months of of all those women telling him he was wonderful they all wanted an advantage I say oh they may not have all been that way but if human nature holds true that was there it was present but but I love some of the statements that we read in the scriptures it says now um let me go back here and find it verse 12. let's go back to verse 12. now when every maid's turn was come to go into king ahazarus after that she had been 12 months according to the men of women who skipped on down the verse 13 then thus came every Maiden to the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the King's house so after 12 months of purification and instruction and time with haggai they were they were permitted to take whatsoever they desired with them to go and that was how they were going to present themselves to the king so whatever a dormant they chose headdressing perfuming well I don't know what the I don't know what all was laid out for them but it says whatsoever they desired was given to them and you can see now after 12 months in this position with the stakes being so high and human nature being what it was you can see how people could these women could easily start injecting their own ideas amen and not just do what everybody else is doing I don't want to go just exactly like haggai says because if everybody I I want some Advantage I'll do a little extra bow here and a little extra color here and a little extra Flair here and before realizing it she was adding to the instructions of haggai she was adding to or taking away she might say well that looks boring if everybody goes in I need to do this and I need to do that and and we know Esther didn't go that way instead of Esther she only took that which is appointed to her she required nothing but what was appointed to her by haggai the king's Chamberlain she trusted the king's servant because she knew that if anybody in the room knew haggy I knew and I'll tell you the same thing if anybody amen if anybody at the end time knew what the king likes it is brother Branham amen if there's anybody who had a relationship and an understanding of the word it is he who understood what the king wants what he desires what he's looking for what he's going to attach himself to and Esther had more character than all of them because they were all allowed to take whatever they wanted but she had enough uh humility to say I don't know I don't know what the king wants I've never been she may have never been in the palace she may never been in the presence of the king she may have never laid eyes on him before but she had enough sense to know that I'm just going to do exactly what haggai says and and the other woman may think that's boring that's not nice enough that's to this or that's not enough of this and they were dressing it up let's say Amen to impressed the king and maybe not just to impress the king because then as the atmosphere of competition intensifies I wonder how many times they were trying to outdo each other human nature never changes Christ is here uniting with the bride that bride is being purified by the word she's being prepared to come into a union with Christ by the washing of the water of the word and and we still have free more latency we can present ourselves to Christ any way we want we can add a little this and add a little that but I wonder how many times we're trying to impress the king or how many times we're trying to impress one another or outdo one another with our spirituality or with our gifts or with our this I wonder how many churches are trying to outdo another church or how many families are trying to outdo another family or how many sisters are trying to outdo another sister or brothers or brother and being spiritual and more spiritual and having more Revelation and and a a greater this and a greater Ministry and a greater has times really changed amen and all of a sudden the the atmosphere we it becomes conducive Amen to to competition and doing a little better and presenting myself and what are we trying to do amen all of a sudden we're trying to get advantage over one another Amen to get favor of the king and in these girls minds they believed that they were going to get favor of the king but Esther went in there not promoting herself not promoting her gifts not doing anything extra she went in there exactly according to the way haggy I told her she had true humility they all presented themselves in Pride she came in humility because she only required what was appointed by haggai she didn't have to spice it up flare it up she didn't have to pump it up she didn't have to program it up she didn't have to gift it up you see the wrong conception the wrong perception amen that somehow I have to make myself more attractive to God Esther was not going in there relying on sensuality she was not going in there relying on on on her her I don't know what else I mean she wasn't going in on her Charisma she wasn't going in on her style she wasn't going on her gifts she wasn't going in on sensuality which is natural things she was going there by what haggy I had appointed and she followed the instructions of the king's Chamberlain and when the king saw her she was different than the rest and immediately she found favor with him we do not have to make ourselves more presentable to Christ by by flaring things up and styling things up and pumping things up and working up gifts and working up music and and having the best of this and the greatest of that and being better than this or better than that amen that that is the carnal side of church life amen and that's not what we want I want to know what that Prophet taught amen he knows the mind of Christ and is brought to us in this age through that gift and I want to present myself that way and what was that presentation amen it wasn't using my gifts to impress God God's not impressed with gifts not trying to impress God with my preaching not trying to impress God with my singing not trying to impress god with how many people I prayed for amen that doesn't impress God what God is looking for is somebody that will just obey his word that's what he's been looking for that was what was wrong with vashti vashti probably had tons of gifts we noticed that she was extremely beautiful she may have had Charisma and etiquette and refinement she may have had likely she did she was a king in the palace she may have had all of that so the king rejected that because she wouldn't keep his word so the king's not looking for more of that he's looking for something different than vashti and all of the women around are continually trying to present themselves like vashti I can do a little better for myself than that and and when it really comes down to it when I mean when we get down to the core of it these women went in a way that pleased themselves when we just get down to the core of it that's what they thought was beautiful they thought was attractive they thought would be pleased and oh if a church can't be guilty of the exact same thing if we as Believers as individuals that we can be guilty of the exact same thing of trying to present ourselves to God in really a way that we like we enjoy that we think is great but Esther didn't do that brother Branham says in the marriage of the Lamb that Esther was to become a bride so she didn't want none of that adorning of the world she wanted to go in through the king just like she was she adorned herself like the Pentecostal women ought to with Meek humble spirit and when all these fancy first ladies come by with all their newfangled thing Fang dangled things the king looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines but when Esther came into his side and he got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's her go get the crown and put it on her head that's it all right again in marriage of the Lamb it says Esther perched her heart before God walked up with a Meek and humble Spirit the church that's going to be the bride of Christ now remember Esther refused the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king and the women today the church that thinks she's going to get in because she's got more numbers she's the best dressed crowd she's got the biggest organization the biggest church in the city and things like that you'll miss it a million miles if you're depending on that it's a sweet reverent Spirit to the word of God Washed by the Water of the word and the word in you how do I present myself Amen to present yourself to this King Christ the King Amen to find favor in his eyes amen is not to to attach not to present your gifts not to not to work anything up but just come humbly reverent to the work that he's given us in this day and you'll get his attention you'll find you'll find favor in his eyes because he hasn't for for thousands of years been able to find the people amen that'll just stay with the word as he gives the word they're always wanting something more I mean he gave him a land they wanted a king and uh I mean we just on and on and on we find the things that that happened down through the Bible and down through the church ages amen they're always trying to to make it something better something flashier something more presentable amen but but Esther came down to a Do or Die moment she's either going to be the queen or she is going to be in the concubines house and friends we've come down to do or die this is not church churchianity church one this isn't I I'm going to church and we're all going to be bride this comes down to an individual level amen you're going to come into the presence of the king and you're either going to be a concubine a church member or you're going to be bride and and it's sad to say but I wonder how many concubines are around they've had an experience with the Lord they've had an encounter with the King each of these concubines had an experience with the Lord they had an encounter with the King is that right they had an encounter but remember brother Branham said you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and die and go to hell because it was only on the spirit it wasn't on the soul it wasn't a new birth it wasn't bringing a seed to life but it was the same Holy Ghost not a different Holy Ghost it was the same spirit of God you came in contact and had an experience with that spirit of God Amen but you were never conceived on the word the word never conceived in you you didn't become bride wife of Jesus Christ you had an encounter an experience amen encounter with with a supernatural God but that's not it you can have that experience and still be a concubine and sit in church the rest of your life go into the house of the king go into the inner chamber have an experience with the King and then the king sends you to the house of shash gas and you still go and all of your pride thinking I was still the best presented I still did what was right I and all of my ideas are still right but there was a humble one among them named Esther and she wasn't jogging for his position she wasn't vying for first place in anything she was just submitting to Hagia haggy I said this haggy I said that haggy I put me here I gave me this guy I said this and listen friends I don't want you to get the notion one drop that I think a legalistic attachment to the prophet is going to get you anywhere because that's still the wrong understanding Esther had to pick up more than just drop this perfume here and wash this water here and he did she had to pick up more she had to catch the picture behind it amen she had to catch what the king lied amen because now she has to go to the king without haggai and he's not standing over her shoulder saying turn right turn left smile slightly now tilt your head to the right amen no she had to go by herself into the presence of the king and in order to present herself right when Hagia is not there she has to catch she has to catch the understanding of what Hagia is trying to get her to be haggy is trying to get her to be that certain kind of woman to carry herself a certain way to present herself a certain way to be purified by a certain purification amen and Esther could catch the lesson that was lost on the rest of the women they were going through the motions there may have been women who were more legalistic than Esther if haggai says three drops of this in a bath and two drops of that and we you may have had people with one two three four oh drain all the water he said only three drops Esther may have been going there one day one two three four oh okay Point wasn't exactly following every word the point was understanding why this ointment purifies you how why you must be purified before you meet the king why you have to spend 12 months why why you have to carry yourself a certain way what the king is looking for what the king wants Esther had to catch more because the the the the woman who could legalistic follow everything that haggy I said is going to end up derailed when haggai's not there and she comes into the presence of the king and the King asked her a question that wasn't on the flash cards and the King puts her in a situation amen that wasn't in the textbook do you understand what I'm trying to say this isn't legalism this is a respect for the Chamberlain this is a respect amen for the servant of the king who knows what the king is looking for and now I'm not looking in the mirror I'm not looking at the other women I'm not looking at the world and what Fashions are outside of sushi and the palace I'm looking at that King's Chamberlain because I know he understands what the king's looking for he knows what went wrong before and he knows what the king wants and I'm looking at him to try to understand the why behind it all [Music] because he's not going with me into the inner chamber I'm going there alone it's not about me and Hagia in Christ it's about me and Christ and I I can't always go to cue cards and I can't always go to textbooks amen now I have to get the lesson that was learned in the school and I have to understand the application of the life and Esther embodied what haggy I was trying to do Esther became the the the purified virgin ready to be presented to the king because she was willing to Humble herself and drop all of her own ideas and forget about what she knew before and forget about what everybody else was saying and just pay attention to the one who really knew you know we there's no way you you're ever going to get anybody that knows this message to confess that they're doing what the other virgins did but we do it all the time we really have to be honest with ourselves we've taken our own ideas so many times we we've didn't we didn't really understand why Rhythm said that we really didn't understand why he made that a requirement or he taught it that way and and there's been so many attempts to explain or or or or or uh explain away even sometimes statements that were made but in my mind it's that's not the point my point is I want to understand why he said of course I don't understand it it doesn't make sense to me but there's a reason behind it amen and I want to know the mind of the king I want to know the one that I'm coming into Union with I want to know all about him and this man's been there knows his mind been given instruction from the king I want to understand why he said that but there's so much explaining away there's so much uh uh taking our own ideas oh God help us Proverbs 18 12 says Before Destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honor is humility but the man says over and over the Way Up Is Down the the all of these things but I don't oh my I'm going to look at second Kings chapter 9 verse 30. I just want to look at one verse there Second Kings 9 verse 30. we know the destruction of ahab's house now is coming in order according to the prophecy of Elijah and jehu is the agent that God is using for that it says and when jehu verse 30 when jehu was come to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out a window amen this word tired her head it's shortened version of a tired it means to be good be pleasing be well be glad to be glad be joyful to be well placed so what did Jezebel do when jehu was coming in judgment to judge amen the the and the in the false in ahab's house and all of that according to the prophecy what did she do she she did herself up I guess it's the easy way she put her face on she got her hair done up she you gotta retired she set the ornaments whatever she did amen she did something because somehow she was of the understanding that I can use my appearance I can use my beauty I can use my class or position my gifts or whatever I can use that to appease the wrath of God I can appease jehu and jehu represented the wrath of God I can use my beauty my Prestige my ornaments my gifts my all of that and I can appease that is exactly what the false Church thinks she says I am in no Widow and in need of nothing I mean she believes that she's beautiful that she's not destined for destruction and that her beauty and her gifts and her abilities amen can somehow amen stop or persuade or appease the wrath of God and jehu paid no attention to the painting of their eyes or the tiring of her head or anything that she tried to do to present herself a certain way to jehu he stopped she looked out the window he said is there anybody in there on our side and there was a eunuch there that pushed her out the window and she died none of those appeasing things are going to appease the wrath of God none of those gifts and the talents and and beauty and adornment and the church is going to appease the wrath of God God is looking for one thing and one thing only and that's those that will keep his word that'll humble themselves to the word of God brother Graham says and the message be not afraid to desire from 1960 says some people think humility is something that ought to wear a skirt meaning it's weak and it's feminine and it's that's what brother Graham says he says some people think humility is something that ought to wear a skirt no no you misunderstand that Jesus the humblest man that ever lived he could play a ropes together and look on them with anger and run down to the tip run them out of the temple yes sir certainly so humility is not weakness humility is not an inability for Action amen humility is actually a surrender to the word and will of God humility would move somebody to action humility would move somebody to be firm or take action or move brother or move Jesus to make a whip and drive the money changers out because he was zealous over the house of God so you can see humility is not this weakness there's a lot of boldness sometimes involved in humility because when God requires it humility will subdue my own feelings and take God's word and move in a bold way this is what what Esther had to do if I could if I could reinforce in your heart the strength by which it's in my heart I would that all of these women were under the ministry of haggai and they all were given things for purification they all had access to some of the same things the same same ointments and same perfumes in the same processes and same Foods they had they all had and they were all going to meet the king if if I could just God will just help me in some ways it would have been safer to not be called and stay in the province and marry and raise children and have a family understand what I'm saying they're calling and bringing into haggy eyes Ministry and to the appointment of women into the house of the women when they were called into this position now only one is going to be selected to bride they've come to the most critical Junction of their entire life and the rest of their life all of life depends on this and they can't make the king do anything they have no control over the king they can't make him decide one or the other he will decide the one that pleases him that's the criteria he will choose the one that pleases him and so now these women have been called and I'm sure at first it was very prestigious because they were only calling the fair young virgins they weren't calling polluted women corrupted women had to be virgin first so that was honorable title then they had to be fair and they had to be young so in order to fit that title you already knew that one of the king's servants thought that you were beautiful young and virtuous so there's a great honor and there's a great Prestige and maybe some pride that went along with being called amen and as they're called I'm sure there's excitement to coming in and coming into the the palace and to the house of the women and I'm sure it was beautiful and there was many things to see and many things to learn and as haggy I would begin to present amen all about the palace and the court and court order and all the things about the king and his history and his background and the royal family I'm sure there was a lot of excitement and enthusiasm but can you imagine what it was like to be one of those 40 50 100 200 300 5 000 I don't know how many women and realize only one only one is going to be clean the rest of us are going to be regular old-fashioned church members one of us is going to be the bride the rest of us are going to be church members I say that intentionally for a reason so that we can get this down in our hearts we've been called into the ministry of haggai we've been separated out as Fair young virgins and brought to an appointment with the King but they actually entered into the most dangerous place in their life they actually moved into a place that was Do or Die that was church member or bride that was the concubines or the wife they actually were put into a position where there was no turning back there was no retreat there was no way out and and it's a privilege to be called by God to the message in this hour it's a privilege to come amen it's a privilege to hear the things and learn the things and sit under the ministry of haggai Amen but it should become more serious to us that this is do or die I'm either going to be a church member in the message or I'm going to be bride not just because I come into the house of the women not because I've heard the teaching of a haggai not just because the the things I heard and enjoyed and I saw the beauty and Grandeur of it all but no there's there's going to be a selection process and I can't make the king do anything he's going to do it of his own choosing by what pleases him so now what is it that I'm going to do how am I going to be pleasing to the king how am I going to be that bride amen and Esther comes to this position and so do these other women but it motivated the other women to make themselves more attractive and more acceptable but Esther had the humility to say there's nothing I can do other than what's been given me and Esther can you imagine uh I'm sure Esther probably wasn't the first one and others had went and they always all the women are eager to get the report back and the house of the women so so sister so and so went what happened oh she went to the house of shash gas next one okay he hasn't made a selection yet and can you imagine each one of those women is his third time to walk into the inner chamber for her encounter with the King she's going to come out of there forever different she'll either be a church member or she'll be a bride I don't think that it's just me I don't think that that place was a place of flipping light-hearted but I think for each of those women there was contemplation there was self-reflection there was a tension because if they weren't pleasing to the king they went to the house of the women if they were pleasing to the king they were the next Queen and each one would maybe I I don't know what they would do so just if you allow me just to dramatize based off Human Nature each one as they leave the house of the women they go to the big mirror all the way around you know it's perfect to tear everything's I've got the jewels I got the it's all here they ask the other women you know how do I look is everything fine which the other women were just they would have lied to him anyways they were missing their hair dormant or they had a big curl hoop down hanging out to the side they'd been like you look good go see the king can you imagine the anticipation the the the desire the pressure the reverence the tension I think so many times we're so flippant about the things of God we take so lightly Where We Are and what we've been called to and what this really means and I don't think they went skipping across the courtyard or down the hall or however they got I would imagine that was a long walk a long thoughtful contemplated nervous walk and when Esther comes to the door she's going to go in before the king she's wearing the shoes haggy I said to wear she's wearing the dress haggy I says the where she's got the headdress on that haggy I said and she put her hair up the way haggy I said she's wearing the perfume haggy I said you see that woman is going to walk in there and she is not dependent on one thought of her own she's not going in there trying to present a gift or a feature or a sensuality she's not listen none of these women were going to entice the King by sensuality because the king could have any woman he wanted and he had vastly the most beautiful of all that was that's not what the king's looking for she's not trying to uh uh achieve things naturally if I could say it that way but she comes and she was different than all the others to me that means all the others did not only require what haggy I had appointed because when everybody saw Esther they all she they all she found favor in the eyes of all of them amen there was something different about Esther than there was about all the other women and Esther's respect oh my goodness Esther's respect for the king was demonstrated in her respect for the king's Chamberlain and so when when she stepped out of that house she didn't come with her own thought with her own idea with her own Doctrine she came because she'd been under the ministry of haggai and haggai had dressed her in the dressing of the word and now she comes to the door and and Esther doesn't have to worry about if her idea is good enough she doesn't have to worry about if if her uh little extra adornment or her little extra gift or her she don't have to worry about if any of that's enough because she's not relying on any of that amen she oh I I believe Esther come to the place where she says if Hagia is right then this is right if haggai is right then this is the right way to present myself to the king and if Hagia is wrong I I don't know how to be right can we understand that as a bride if Hagia is wrong ha wow what chance do I have of finding a right way to please the Lord if haggai's wrong so this is this is a situation that these women are stepping into amen and and and you know they had all kinds of different ideas in their mind and different thoughts and different expectations but over and over they came to the king encountered the king had an experience with the King amen and moved on to the church and they sat in church the rest of their lives and now I'm not talking about baptist church now I'm talking about our church and they kept their idea and they kept their experience nobody's going to take it away they hadn't experience they encountered something real but there was one who wasn't just going to have one experience with the King she was going to come into a lifelong Union with the King she was going to become the queen she was going to receive seed she was going to be a joint Heir she was going to live in the past she she was going to get the inheritance that was lost by the other she was going to get everything all the others had an experience with the King all the others had a testimony they could tell about that experience amen but they were in the church amen but there was one who wasn't in the church amen she was in the palace amen she was in the household she was the wife she was not a she was not a one-time experience she was an all the time experience she was the wife of the king I tell you when you start to realize the impact and the reality of where we are we are sitting in the most dangerous seats a human being can sit in you're sitting in the most dangerous seats I'm standing in the most dangerous place amen why because it's always close truth that's dangerous and close to the king is dangerous you can think of one of these women who wind up in the house of the concubines she's there she may never be called to the king ever again and she lives the rest of her life and can you imagine 20 30 years later she's thinking if I would have stayed in the village I could have had a husband I could have had children I could add a home of my own but here I am in the church oh all right it becomes a dangerous place to be close to the king and have an encounter in the king and take our own ideas and to stick with their own ideas it becomes very dangerous I hope that this is getting through the way that it's Dropped In My Heart could you turn with me to the Book of Ruth look at Ruth chapter 3. many of us are very familiar with Ruth and how she was the moabitist a gentile who when a himelek and his two sons and his wife Naomi they left their land they went to Moab because of a famine they're the two sons married two moabitus a Naomi's return one stays back but Ruth says I'll go where you go and your people who might be be my people my God will be your God and it's a type of the Old Testament in the New Testament Naomi and the Gentile bride Ruth and it's also a type of the old church and the new church brother Ben uses all these types so we know this story but I want to I'm going to look at it in a context a certain context here and Ruth chapter 3 verse 1. it says then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not Boaz of our Kindred which has whose maidens thou lust with whose means thou was behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyselfs therefore an anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shall go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayeth unto me I will do President says in the message kinsman redeemer and from 1960 he says now I want you to notice Naomi the old church begin to explain to Ruth all the laws about a religion like the Old Testament is a shadow of the new now I want you to get this story right here now I want to show the Shadows the Old Testament explaining the new if you'll just read it for it's a foreshadow of the new so brother benham's taking it as Naomi the instruction of the word the Old Testament instructing the new are Naomi instructing the word to Ruth all right so so Naomi now is giving instructions unto Ruth and Ruth has the humility to listen to Naomi Ruth has her own mind she's come from her own culture she had her own raising before she was married before Naomi was her mother-in-law she has even seen maybe Naomi's faults but she's humble enough to listen to the word that Naomi's giving her and she she tells Naomi to go down to the threshing floor and and to find out where the man laid down and go lay yourself down at his feet now the instruction name is giving to Ruth these are dangerous instructions these are I can put it this way these are scandalous instructions because she is a widow woman Ruth is a young widow woman Boaz is a single man as far as we understand the story to be and and at night she has no business uncovering his skirt and laying down at his feet there's no business for a woman to lay at the feet of a man at night when there should be no woman at the threshing floor and and Naomi's giving her instructions and the instructions to him he's giving her amen they're extremely dangerous I'll just put it that way let's go to uh chapter 3 verse 6. let's continue reading and she went down to the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law obeyed her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered I am Ruth thine handmade spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou the Lord my daughter for thou has shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in so much as thou followest not young men whether poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requires for all the city of my people does know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than I tarry this Knight and it shall be in the morning that if it will be that if he will perform unto thee the part of kinsman well let him do the kinsman's part but if he will not do the part of a Kinsmen to thee then will I do the part of a Kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth lie down until the morning so there's a there's a lot going on here I'm not going to be able to get into all the details but but here uh we'll just see what brother Branham says here in kinsman redeemer now notice closely now Naomi said to Ruth now he is our Kinsmen and if you can find Grace with him you'll find rest if you can find Grace you'll find rest Boaz represented Christ the rich man the heir of all things the lord of the Harvest oh my how when Boaz came riding out there in the that Carriage looked around over the fields and his eyes fell on Ruth he was mastered he was Lord of the Harvest and she found Grace in his sight that's what the church does today while the lord of the Harvest is going by he ain't looking to Big to big buildings big Steeples well-trained choirs he's looking for individuals men and women who are dedicated and made a clean cut for for Christ earlier is a clean-cut decision a clean cut for Christ consecrating themselves to his service God I believe it every word of it when your word says anything I stay right with it that's your word I believe it every word that's what he's looking for the lord of the Harvest that's what he wants to give the Holy Spirit to those who are hungering and thirsting blessed are ye that hunger and thirst for you shall be filled he's trying to find that church today now when Ruth was asked to do something that was disgraceful but she was willing because she'd made her decision what type of believer what a perfect type so they're a perfect type of a Believer why she was asked to do something disgraceful she was asked to do something that in the eyes of the world was wrong that in the eyes of the world what was inappropriate and wrong she was asked to actually sneak in at night to where a man was laying asleep and uncover his skirt and lay herself at his feet this was scandalous this was wrong this was an inappropriate do you understand what I'm saying and Ruth had enough humility to do what Naomi said and what was she doing she was following Naomi's instructions and in following Naomi's destruction she was asked to do something that if this goes wrong I'm going to look bad to everybody the whole city considered her a virtuous woman but they would consider her a harlot if this went wrong if this goes the wrong way amen this this is we're coming down to another Do or Die moment we're coming down to it's going to go one way or it's going to go the other if this man accuses me of attempted harlotry she's going down to Boaz she can't control what Boaz will say she does not control Boaz she only controls herself Boaz can say whatever he wants if Boaz doesn't if Boaz doesn't understand what she's doing if Boaz has a false accusation she could be accused of harlotry you see how dangerous this is it's only going to go one way or the other in the Kinsmen Redeemer says Ruth a gentile excommunicated runoff has been brought to be accepted his bride Christ came in just at Barley season he said now put the now put the garments upon thee talking about Naomi's instructions not take the garments off of thee how contrary today gird the garments upon thee when you go to meet him he's going to win a barley tonight go down and put your garments on cover yourself up to meet him how do you cover yourself up to meet him you clothed yourself in the word you don't take a word off you put all the word on and today they want to uncover themselves cover yourself go down because he winners barley and then Mark the place where he lieth down did you do it on galgotha many years ago I marked in my heart where he laid down his life that he might take me Mark the place where he lie it down watch where he laid that's what every believer should do mark what he done for you now he's trying he's typing uh Boaz as Christ and he laid down at Calvary and you go to his feet there amen and it's a beautiful time but he goes on and he says uh and kinsman redeemer oh what a clear-cut decision Ruth said sorry Ruth said what you say that I'll do what a clear-cut decision for a Believer what the Bible says that I'll do it says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I'll do it if it says go into all the world and preach the gospel I'll do it if it says whatever it says Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today forever ever what it says for me to do I'll do it see the church taking its orders from the word she laid down so he's typing these strong instructions from Naomi as the word coming to Ruth and Ruth humbling herself to the word now remember here's what he says now remember that was a disgrace for that young widow woman to be laying by the side of this man and his feet a disgrace to the outside world oh can you stand it here it is look look this is it the church the young women the young men the older and young it's asked to separate themselves from the world and come into a place a kingdom of the Holy Ghost that's disgraceful to the world in their own heart they know what it's all about but to the world they become a fanatic they become a Holy Roller or something on that idea some disgraceful name but the church is asked to do it are you willing to Mark the place and lie down let the world call you anything they want to hmm Ruth now under the instructions of the word she's got to come to a place where she made her decision to follow the word but her decision to follow the word was not going to land her in an in-between state it is either going to put her accused of being a harlot or the wife of the lord of the Harvest she is going to go one way or the other she is not going to come she's not going to come out of this encounter halfway anything does that make sense to you understand we come to this message we are not going to we we are going to go one way or the other with this word friends we are going to continue in our own idea mixed with the truth and we're going to we are going to go into harlotry still receiving man's seed and mixing it with what the prophet brought I hope you understand what I'm saying we're going to come we're either going to come or we're going to come and be recognized by Boaz as the right kind of woman and we're going to be brought into the Plan of Redemption or we're going to be accused of doing something wrong and we can be accused of doing something wrong anyways how many of you come to the message and everybody else around you thought you were doing something wrong it looked wrong it looked evil it looked backwards it looked like it was contrary to the word they accused you of following a man that accused you a following a call they accuse you of all kinds of spiritualism is that right and so what what you were doing and following the word you were subjecting yourself to the wrong opinion of all the outside world because you were going to slip down in the dark of night and uncover a man's feet and you're giving yourself completely holy to this man who you can't control this was the most dangerous decision of Ruth's life this was the most dangerous point in her life she could wind up burnt as a harlot Stoned by the congregation rejected by everybody uh she was an outsider anyways but she had a good reputation she could have been cast out she could have lost what little bit she had she could have lost it or she could have gained everything she could have never had on her own she came to the point and when she came to the point she didn't take her ideas her thinking she just did what Naomi told her she just did what the word says oh I I hope I hope this is coming across the right way every one of us sit in the most dangerous position you can't come to this message and hold back and halfway believe in one foot in one for out and I'll just wait and see how things go and I can jump either way when the time comes God's not going to let it stay that way it's either in or out it's either all the way or it's a concubine I don't know how else to say it I it's just the reality of where we're at God didn't bring us the greatest word the greatest Revelation has ever struck the Earth for us to be halfway Believers and halfway not Believers and and stuck somewhere in between and not fully committing to anything that is not what we're that's not where we're at friends and not taking some of what the prophet said or most of what the prophet said and still mixing it with some of my own ideas and my own old understanding from denominational days or my own new understanding that I came up with by myself in the message it goes both ways but for Ruth this is what's been hitting me with impact when Esther walked through that door it was Do or Die when Ruth went down to that flesh threshing floor at night it was Do or Die if somebody turned the lights on how are you going to explain that do you understand what I'm saying she was giving herself up Esther was giving herself up and trusting haggai Ruth was giving herself up but I'll take it back this way Esther was completely giving herself up and trusting haggai and trusting the king and she was moving from haggai to the king trusting that this was a true servant of that King and she had to trust in both and here comes Ruth she comes to a point where she has to trust Naomi and she has to trust Boaz and she has to trust that Naomi knows Boaz and she knows the word and she's giving her good instruction because Naomi understands the law of Kinsmen Redeemer she's a Jew she understands this word and she has to trust Naomi giving her the right word and she has to trust the character of that man on the threshing floor not to expose her falsely when we come to Christ in this message we have to trust that this was a servant of Christ we have to trust that God sent him and God spoke through him and he was here to to dress a bride for her Union with Christ to prepare her for Christ and then we have to trust Christ that Christ is not going to give us false hope and cast us away and overexpose us because we're we're making the the ultimate decision the most dangerous decision of Our Lives that I'm believing this servant of the king and now I'm going to walk myself all alone without haggai into the presence of the king trusting his character to not expose me not do me wrong not cast me away this is why nothing in between is going to work if I don't come God's provide a way then if if I want to come my own way I can have an encounter with the king I can have an experience in church and I can be a concubine but I don't think any of us want to be that I think we want to be his bride in order to be that then I have got to sell out everything if I'm going to be as bright if Ruth is going to be in the program of redemption if she's going to be in the lineage of Christ if she's going to bring Redemption and salvation to herself and Naomi she has to give up everything not partial all Esther if she's going to be part of God's Plan of Salvation for the Jews if she's going to save her own life amen she is going to have to give all not partial and you and I are not here for partial we're here for all oh my goodness God help us let's look at verse 14. but first let's let's see what boaz's response was she dressed herself according to what Naomi said not undressed herself Ruth also is not trying to entice Boaz she's not trying oh she is not trying to seduce Boaz you understand what I'm saying she's not using her gifts or her charm or her Charisma she's not using her physical appearance she's not using any of that she's not Charming Boaz she is humbling herself and laying herself as a as a handmaid At His Feet as a servant and she is trying to to win his pleasure by her character and obedience to Naomi and and Boaz is not he's not Charmed uh by her Charisma he he is not taken off his feet by her hairdress he's not he's not swept away by her fragrance but he watches her submission and her yielding herself to him and he says your kindness and the latter end is better than the first because he understands he says that you did not go after young men whether rich or poor which indicates that Boaz is not a young man and and she now is giving herself not for not for sensuality not for personal pleasure she is now surrendering so for Redemption her motive her motive in doing what the world sees is bad her motive in leaving the church she grew up in her motive and not no longer believing in the trinity I mean if you don't believe in the Trinity and you believe God sent a prophet and you believe water baptism in Jesus name and you believe that women and men should dress holy and conduct themselves holy and you believe all of these things then then then you are considered a wrong kind of person with the wrong motives and you're considered following after devils and that is harlotry so you're you get an untasty name you're considered an outcast to harlot just for following the word and here comes a woman who will can who will be considered an outcast and who'd be willing to be considered a harlot doing something that would be disgraceful until all the other churches what we do is disgraceful believe God sent a prophet and that he brought the correct teaching on the word and denounce everything else contrary to that that's considered disgraceful to the denominational world and she came that way laying herself complete she is now completely exposed and 100 in the hands of Boaz her whole life is in his hands he says what are you doing here hey guys come here look at this her life is over her reputation is really she's done she is coming but she's coming with a motive she's coming for a purpose and she's not coming there for sensual pleasure she's not coming there for personal rewards she's coming there according to the word because there's a law of a Kinsmen Redeemer and she is the only one a man that can fit this place amen because Boaz is the only one that can bring Redemption and bring Redemption through a seed but Naomi already said I can't bring you any more seeds she's already old now Ruth is in the only position for Redemption and she's willing to lay her life down and forget everything she knew her reputation and whether this will go right or wrong She lays it down for Redemption and when Boaz looks at her he says everybody knows you're a virtuous woman but now your kindness in the latter end is better you're not here because of sensual reasons you're not here for illicit pleasure you're not here for your own gratification you are here for Redemption and to preserve life oh how many women would have liked Boaz for a husband rich lord of the Harvest what had what had Boaz seen in his lifetime flirting and whatever I mean you can only imagine don't go thinking that four or five thousand three four five thousand years ago was different than today just a lot of different things appear different but the heart of man's the same so Boaz he recognizes what she did in every other circumstance what she did would be wrong but for the circumstance of redemption what she did was right I hope that makes sense I don't even know how deeply that makes sense but it makes sense let's go to verse 14. now Boaz tells her uh in verse 13 then he says lie down until morning he told her just to stay there till the morning stay at his feet so she remained in the position of a servant through the night but in the morning there's going to be a transition because we've come to the dawning of a new day when there's going to be a transition where I no longer call you church but I call you bride something's changing in the new day so stay till morning in verse 14 and she lay at his feet until morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor now he's protecting her character he he she's in his hands but he knows how to handle the situation also he said verse 15 also he said bring the veil that thou Hast upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city in which she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave him me for he said to me go not empty unto them into thy mother-in-law then said she said sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day so now in the in the dawning of a new day early in the morning at the rising of the sun we could say there's a resurrection of Boaz and when there's a resurrection of boas there's a resurrection of Ruth as well she'd been laying through the rest of the night at his feet as a servant but now the transition is going to take place so for the transition takes place he takes her veil he said take your Veil so at this point now that the bride has been unveiled foreign and put six measures of barley amen six measures of the seed of the seed word are six seals in her veil and she's caring and he places it upon her and now she's carrying six seals because she has the revelation of the seals please follow with me put on your spiritual jackets now in the transition in the early morning of this new day he's going to take her veil and he's going to she's now unveiled before him and now he's going to put six measures of barley he's going to give the interpretation of the six seals she had been gleaning word all through the Harvest period getting a little bit and the lord of the Harvest told his servants drop handfuls of purpose for her so he's talking to the seven Church uh aged Messengers and the ministers that follow after to keep drawing the gleaning keep dropping word for her and she's working and laboring to pick up little bits of word and every day she's getting little bits of word and threshing it out and she's surviving her and them are surviving on this little bits of word that she's gleaning but oh they're coming to the end of the Harvest and there's not going to be an opportunity for gleaning anymore now it's going to go into the coldness of winter soon so before it goes into the coldness of winter when there's not any more gleaning or Reapers in the field to drop handfuls of purpose now he takes what's been been gathered all of the word that's been gathered up and he gives her six heaping full full loads of the six seals [Music] and he sends her back and she shows Naomi and Naomi Knows by this that he's going to accomplish all that he said She Knows by the opening of the seals that he's going to he will not rest till he finishes it this day what day this bride day this new day The Eighth Day he's not going to finish to accomplish all that he said why because he gave you the six men in your Veil he put the six measures of barley he gave you these heaping measures of the word because you've been gleaning gleaning gleaning and now he gave it to you in abundance and she goes back to the house she's not gleaning anymore her enemy are at the house they've got more than they need but that's not the end of the story because she doesn't yet have the seventh seal foreign the matter is not complete until the seventh seal and and when you look at the six measures of barley he gave to her that was a tremendous blessing if you were the woman who had been gleaning and gleaning and gleaning and grabbing handfuls and beating it out at the end of the day and going home with a little apron pocket full of seed to grind and make some bread for that day or a few days and trying to get some together for winter I mean if that was you in your life and you had been living that way like the church lived through the church ages when all of a sudden heaps upon you word upon word upon word upon word she's going home with the Jubilee she's got a veil full of burden on her back she's got all the word that she can handle right now [Music] how did she get to this point because she gave everything her reputation and all and come to the point where it's Do or Die and when Boaz saw that he knew the motive of their heart and the intention and he said I will redeem I will finish I will do all that you require but I just don't know how to I don't know how to articulate everything that's in my heart but they're feasting on the six seals feasting on it white horse rider Antichrist Spirit right feasting on I mean glory in the abundance but Redemption wasn't sealed and the six seals Redemption was sealed in the seventh and he he was entering into his claiming Ministry to finish the Redemption process and claim what he had redeemed under the seventh seal in the new day and let's look at chapter 4 verse 13. we know he goes into the City and he he he makes the promise he confronts the near Kinsmen all of those things but then in verse 13 it says so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she'd bear a son when she gave everything at the end of Harvest Time and she humbled herself and gave herself the opportunity to have a bad reputation listen I'll tell you even amongst our friends if you believe in the bride age the eighth in the coming of the Lord you have a bad reputation of maybe being involved in harlotry is that right laying with those you shouldn't lay with and believing things you shouldn't believe but Ruth had to get past all of that Ruth had to get to the place where it didn't matter I'm here for life I'm here to preserve life I'm here for Redemption I'm not here for a name I'm not here for a reputation I'm going to surrender to all of this word and I am here for Redemption and Redemption could only be found in Boaz Andrews so now Boaz does what he has to do and he's in his claiming Ministry and now he comes he comes to Ruth and Ruth has been gleaning Ruth has now got received a promise at the new day Ruth has received the six measures of barley and her veil and and now she's rejoicing in that but if Ruth stays with the six measures of barley and never goes to the seventh redemption's not finished it's good barley it's good word it's a heaping full it's something to Rejoice about it's something to be glad in but if we stay with the with with the six seals amen and miss the seventh seal amen then all of a sudden we're still going to wind up in darkness and coldness of winter because this will run out but there's something that's greater and that's the seventh seal which the seventh seal is not a doctor in the Seven Seals of person and the seventh seal is the lord of the Harvest he's the one who gave the six and brother Graham said I'm not the one who opened those seals he opened those seals who the lord of the Harvest the lord of the Harvest and the new day gave the six measures of barley amen but where was the seventh measure it wasn't going to come like the other six have you read that your church have you read the sales book amen uh the the first seal there's a whole lot of wheat seconds you know they're a whole lot of wheat you go through them all Amen in tying these scriptures together types and shadows showing all of this and you get to the seventh seal and at the end of the seventh seal you're like where's the barley where's the heaping scoop where is it amen you've got to look past the scoop to the hand that's holding the scoop because that's when the seven seal starts to appear and it's the person it's the lord of the Harvest it's the person of the word it's the one who opened the word he's the seven seal and now in the day of redemption she's got the six measures of barley that's just to show that he's not going to stop until he's done but when he's done he's going to come and take that little bride and they're going to go into a secret room and a third pool in a private chamber and they're going to have an invisible Union that nobody else is going to see and in that visible Union she's going to get the seventh measure of seed and that's not going to be another Doctrine that's not going to be that seventh measure of seed is going to be the person of the word the lord of the Harvest in her and until we come to that point we haven't come to Redemption that's why to wait on the seventh seal is dangerous to deny the seventh seal is dangerous there's nothing wrong with rejoicing over the six I mean let's Rejoice over the six but once you get the seventh you never have to worry about running out of the six amen because the lord of the Harvest owns the field owns the weed owns the Garners owns it all and he's constantly giving more barley more barley more but you're never going to run out because you are part of the lord of the Harvest you have come as a joint Heir and now there's no fear of the dark winter cycle there's no fear of the apostasy of the seventh age because the lord of the Harvest is your husband he is you and you are him and he is now in you he's injected his seed into you and now you're carrying the seventh seal what happened Boaz was the Redeemer is that right but Ruth had come out of Moab she had come through this Union uh uh with a Jew and now the inheritance has to be restored and a son can restore to the same lineage and and now Boaz does the restoration but when Boaz amen when the when when the when the son of man injects himself into the woman now she's going to produce the son of man now the Redeemer is in Ruth because now when Boaz dies this child gets all of boaz's inheritance and all of ahem elect's inheritance amen everything is restored by the one that's in the woman Redemption and its votes now the Redeemer is in her because she's caring the son the Redeemer the lord of the Harvest now who's she carrying in her womb she's carrying the lord of the Harvest because when Boaz fails off the scene this child will race and be the Lord now the lord of the Harvest is in her the Redeemer is in her the the great king is in her that's where we all want to be how did she get there she had to give everything we all want to be there we all want to be in that new day with the six measures and we we want to be the the one that goes into the private Union and the marriage and receives the seed and now never has to worry again and Redemption is sealed in me amen Redemption was sealed and Ruth Redemption is sealed in you and I when we receive Christ in this day we all want to be there but how many are willing to give up all their ideas and go do something untasty unsavory that might backfire and might make you look really bad how many are willing to leave normal understanding to come into the understanding of the seventh seal how many are willing to look like the wrong kind of woman in order to be the right kind of woman you'd be surprised how many people aren't willing to look bad to be right think about that not willing to look bad to be right but always want to look right and wind up in the house that concubines but there's got to be somebody out there that's willing to look bad in order to be right to look a little bit odd to look a little bit crazy to look a little bit whatever because their motive is right and they want Redemption somebody's got to be willing right somebody's got to be willing to give up their life oh my I want to look a little further down in chapter four at something verse 9. and I'm gonna I'm gonna try to finish with this this next thought not this next scripture okay I don't want to be I don't want to get false advertising I don't want to be accused of anything so let's look here at verse 9. and Boaz said to the elders and all the people your Witnesses this day that I have bought all that was the human limilex and all that was Chileans and Mullins of the hand of Naomi more of a root the moabitus the wife of Molin have I purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren and from the Gate of his place your Witnesses this day and all the people that were in the gate and the Elder said we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman that has come unto thee thy house like Rachel and like Leah which too did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily in effortal and be famous in Bethlehem and let thy house be like the house of pharaz whom Tamar bear unto Judah of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman I think this is an outstanding scripture because of where I want to go next as as they begin to praise Boaz in the decision he's made for Redemption and taking Ruth they begin to say may may this woman that's brought unto you be like Rachel and be like Leah who built the house of Israel the mothers of Israel and may your house be like the house of pharaohs who tame our boar and I looked at this right here in the story of Ruth we have the mention of Tamar who came first and I want to go look at the story of Tamar in Genesis 38. and in the Book of Genesis Judah has three boys and Judah we know is the kingly tribe the scepter is promised to come through Judah he's going to be the head of the government through Judah and and through his tribe is going to come the king so there's a promise laying there Judah has a firstborn son and that son is married to a woman named Tamar but before she could conceive seed he dies so then he's given to the second son because that's the law of the day to bring up seed Into the Dead brother so this son that doesn't necessarily want to bring seed through Tamar because if he sees bring seed through Tamar the seed in Tamar will get the inheritance and he'll be left out you see it's always selfishness it's always lack of humility that's the problem that's why the nearer Kinsmen which is a type of the devil the nearer Kinsman and Boaz as they wouldn't redeem Naomi and take Ruth for a wife because if he did he would raise up seed to the dead and that seed would jeopardize his inheritance selfishness Boaz Ruth had the character of Boaz to give everything for Redemption Boaz had the character of Ruth he was willing to lose his he was willing to give up all of his inheritance for Redemption it's like Christ Christ's bride has his character in Christ has the same character they're both willing to give up everything for the word so now Tamar the second son he pulls a trick and he refuses to give seed and so God smites him dead so now the third is too young to marry Tamar so Judah says go back to your father's house and mourn the death of your husband and when this youngest son is old enough I'll marry you too but then Tamar's there and she's watching from afar and and she's a widow and she's in her father's house but yet she has a right to that lineage which is what Christ she has a right to Christ I want you to look at this because she was married into that linen she became one with the oldest son she has a right to Christ so there's a motivation in her to bring forth this sea and it's it's her motivation she has a a legal right to Christ but when the youngest son comes of age she is not given to that son to wife she's withheld and she now knows this that he he he's he's not keeping his end of the deal but she has a right to Christ I want you to get this in your head to understand where Tamar's thinking is and what her motivation is there is a law in the laws of God that she can bear the firstborn son the lineage of Christ because she was married to the firstborn of Judah and they've denied her that right but it's still her right so Genesis 38 and 13. and it was told Tamar saying Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath to Shear a sheep and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to Timnath for she saw that Sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife when Judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face and he turned into her by the way and said go to I pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me so we see the whole scenario she now goes and she she dresses herself and covers her face and sets in a place where Judah believes her to be a harlot and and now he believing she's the heart that makes a deal and and he joins with her and she becomes pregnant and you say that's a horrible thing we're going to find out if it's a horrible thing or not let's go to verse 24. and it came to pass about three months after that it was told Judas saying Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the Harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and Judah said bring her forth and let her be burned when she was brought forth she she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are am I with child so in the deal he was going to pay her a kid of the of the goats but in the meantime she says what will you give me for Surety and he gave a bracelet a Signet ring and a staff and so now she sins ahead the bracelet the Signet ring and the staff and now Judah is going to realize this is me she's received seed from me and so let's read that again verse 25 when she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are am I with child and she said discern I pray that whose are these the Signet the bracelets and the staff and Judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than I because that I gave her not to Sheila my son and knew and he knew her not again no more you look at this and you say what was timna doing or what was Tamar doing what was she doing she was putting her life in jeopardy she was doing something that would be misunderstood by multitudes of people and I tell you there's probably been multitudes of Christians who've read that Bible and still don't understand what Tamar did you understand what I'm saying but Tamar was not interested in an illicit relationship she wasn't interested in pleasure with a man do you understand this she wasn't there for she wasn't there amen just to excite herself or to bring pleasure to herself she was there because she had a right to Christ and she didn't know how to else to get Christ Christ's being was being withheld from her so she did whatever it took to get back to the original source of the seed and that was Judah she wasn't being a harlot she was more righteous than Judah she did something that looked unrighteous to be righteous what she did looked wrong but it was right how was it right it looked so wrong how is this right it's right not because it's right because the motive is right it's right because the intention is right it's right because the word is right so many of our decisions have been misunderstood why we've moved and left family and moved across the country moved to other cities left jobs Amen to be part of a church and and you have been accused of harlotry if somebody says you follow a false Doctrine that's harlotry you're following after a man that's harlotry okay we're all on the same page we've been accused of harlotry believing the wrong thing receiving the wrong seed from the wrong source it looks bad when you leave your family it looks bad when you pack up and go across the country across the state into another state it looks bad when you give up a good paying job it looks like you've gone too far looks like you're too extreme it looks like when you left your father's Church in your mother's church and your grandfather and grandmother's Church it looks like when you denounce the things you were taught all your life is wrong it looks like when you question the marriages that are around you and you look like the bad one and Tamar looked like the bad one but she was the one in the whole story who was right why she had a right to Christ and she was going to give everything to have Christ Ruth very well could have looked like the bad one but Ruth was willing to give up everything to have Christ she was right her motive was pure her intentions were correct even though what she did looked bad Esther did something different than all the other women and it may he may have been mocked she may have been questioned she may have had little snide remarks how plain she was or how she wasn't going to be noticed by the king she wasn't going to stick with old fuddy duddy hege it looked like she was wrong but she was the one who was right so the question is what does it take to be right in order to be right you don't always look right it's not because everybody says you look right many times in the Bible to be right you look wrong Paul the masses looked like he was wrong he left the traditions of the fathers he left they thought he left Moses he was accused of leaving Moses and he never left Moses he went to the Fulfillment of Moses he went to what Moses was teaching he never left Moses but they thought he left Moses they misunderstood his intentions they misunderstood his motives they misunderstood his actions and and he says he tells the king he says I confess and the way that is called heresy is the way that I worship to God on my father he he had a a name of idolatry attached to him he had a bad name attached to him he looked like an outcast a renegade a rebel uh whatever and being in prison multiple times didn't change the other people's opinion of him it just reinforced what they already thought but Paul was the one who was right and they were wrong I hope a picture's emerging that I am not going to get to Redemption a halfway believer and I'm not going to get to Redemption always trying to look good in the eyes of everybody else but if I'm going to go all the way into the seventh seal and if I'm going to go all the way to Christ in this day it may look bad to some it may look dark and it may look wrong and it may look like all kinds of things but if my motive is pure and the word is behind me and I'm laying my life down for the word for Redemption then you're going to see that it will be righteousness attributed unto me why because I didn't go for myself and not for pleasure not for sensuality amen not with my own ideas but a surrender to the word to come to the Redeemer himself and have him in me that's the whole goal and if that's the whole goal then we're going to have to go all the way all the way this isn't going to be Sunday Wednesday this is not Sunday Wednesday this is life this is not church this is life this is not when I'm with other believers this is like this is you cannot do this partial you'll wind up in the house of the concubines it was it was the king oh God help us please God it was the king ahazarus who Vindicated Esther by sowing his seed in her and receiving her his wife it was Boaz who Vindicated the actions of Ruth by taking her as wife it was Judah who Vindicated the actions of Tamar by declaring her more righteous than himself they couldn't vindicate themselves they couldn't prove themselves they couldn't defend themselves but it was always the Christ that they were coming to the Christ that they laid themselves down to and gave themselves up for it was always that Christ that was their vindication the king Vindicated Boaz Vindicated and Judah if Judah had said differently she would have been burnt if Boaz had said differently she would have been stoned if the king had said differently she'd be moved in the house of the concubines but each one of these women were putting their whole life basing it on the word but putting their whole life in the hands of the man that they came to unite with and I have no interest in playing the part of a harlot and I have no interest in being a concubine it doesn't interest me at all what I'm interested in is redemption that seventh seal the person of Christ himself and I want to get all the way to him and I don't want to go with my idea or my concept or with a clean reputation I just want to get to him if I got to lay at his feet at night if I've got to look like a hearted if I got to do whatever I just want to get to him regardless what everybody thinks about my actions my actions are pure because my heart is pure because he's my goal and he will vindicate her there's nothing they can do to vindicate themselves there's nothing you could do to make him choose and there's nothing you can do to vindicate yourself all you can do is wait for him to vindicate you oh I'm so thankful I'm thankful and fearful that I live in this day because the age of excuses are gone the gauge of partial understanding is gone winking an eye winking at ignorance is gone the word has come now he's looking for the one who will surrender to the word and give herself up for this word and that's who I want to be will we be misunderstood yes yes be falsely accused yes Bank on it may be mocked and sneered a little bit for being too plain or whatever it doesn't matter because I'm not here to be in the house that concubines and I'm not here to be admired by the concubines I'm not here to be admired by The Other Women I am here for Redemption purposes and I'm here to lay myself down at his feet and wait there until he takes me into himself not trying to entice him by my good deeds not trying to entice him by my great gifts or my wonderful accomplishments and in a talent show that's going to win the heart of the king it's not a resume it's got all kinds of accomplishment in accolades that's not going to win the heart of the king humble submissive heart humble to the word that's going to win the heart of the king when I lay down my word my reputation my life and I put it all on the line to have him live in everything else is going to go the wrong way let's all stand I'm not going to preach anymore I'll tell you more than anything I want my motives to be right I I may not be able to I don't know I may not be able to do much I can't prove anything I can't I can't produce anything but oh if I could just make my motives right put my eyes on the right price and be willing to pay any prize to have price to have that prize then I know everything's going to work out because I trust that hege I was the king servant do you trust that haggy I was the king servant and I trust the character of the king that sent this servant to prepare the bride I trust him I trust the character of the king if the king sent this servant to prepare me for my meeting with him then this servant is the one who will get me prepared and I trust the character the king that will take responsibility for his choice and a servant so that I can trust the servant and entrusting the servant I trust the character of that King to say this is what your servant said do I'm not here of my own thinking I'm not hearing my own accord I'm here because this is what the word says and I trust the character of this King that if I come according to his word with the right motive with the right heart and I surrender all for him I trust the character of this King that he will not try me for a harlot he will not expose me as a wrong woman and he will not send me to the house of the concubines but that he will put his seed in me and make me one with him and I'll be married to the seventh seal caring within me the seventh seal the person of the word anything short of that is failure oh it's the I can say it this way it's the greatest treasure that's ever been on this Earth that's been allowed to the Gentile bride it's the greatest treasure that we could achieve is Union with all of Christ a full measure of Christ poured into his church this is the greatest measure but the greatest treasure might require the greatest sacrifice it might just take me giving up everything to win that prize and laying aside every weight and sin that besets and forgetting everything that lay behind and pressing towards a mark it may just take everything moving away and this one thing becoming everything to me and I trust the character of that King and sending the right servant to prepare me to come the right way and if I do it according to his word I trust his character not to reject me but that he will vindicate me and not have me tried for the wrong kind of woman but say this one's righteous I don't care what you thought I don't care what your opinion was but I know what that heart is and I know what that motive is and this one is righteous that's where I put my confidence all those other women could convince with each other they look great In The House of the women in haggai they could all be convinced you're beautiful you're gorgeous you're this you're that oh he'll love your voice oh he'll love your hair all but at the end of the day it didn't matter all that mattered is the one that pleased the King was the one he chose and I want to please the king amen let's bow our heads and musicians if you'll come dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for this day you've given us to live and oh God how what a great time and what a terrible time God while you're drawing and calling your bride to a

is your Vindication vindicating me and that's the only one that matters in the hour of judgment and the hour of Destruction nothing else will do unless you vindicate us Lord we're coming to you father

cover us with your skirts now we're trusting that if we come the right way with the right humility and surrendering all to have you that you'll not disappoint us or let us down but that you'll play
