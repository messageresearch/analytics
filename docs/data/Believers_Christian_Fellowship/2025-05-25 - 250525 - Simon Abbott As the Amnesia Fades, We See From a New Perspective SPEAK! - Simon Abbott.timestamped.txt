[10:10] how the storm is
[10:16] raging, I don't care
[10:20] how the ground is shaking.
[10:26] My eyes fixed on

[10:39] carry me right to the end.
[10:44] [Music]

[10:59] how the ground is
[11:05] shaking. My eyes fixed on
[11:10] Jesus. I'm in his hand.
[11:16] Jesus will
[11:19] carry me right to the
[11:25] end. Jesus will
[11:29] carry
[11:31] me right to the end.
[11:37] [Music]
[11:44] Man, God bless you. It's good to be with
[11:46] you this morning. And as you can see,
[11:48] I'm not taking the morning service.
[11:50] Amen. I asked Brother Simon Abbott if he
[11:52] would take the service. And I didn't
[11:53] intend to. I tended to let him have the
[11:55] time off and just enjoy a short trip
[11:57] here, but uh something kept broken at me
[12:00] all day Friday. So late Friday night, I
[12:03] asked him if he'd take the service. And
[12:05] he said actually the Lord had laid
[12:06] something on his heart. So he was very
[12:08] happy to take it. Amen. And so I was
[12:10] happy to hear that God was working on
[12:11] both ends. But since that time, the
[12:14] devil came after him and he's had a
[12:16] fever for two days. And so uh I I talked
[12:20] to him about I said, "Oh, I didn't know
[12:21] until this morning." And I said, "I'm so
[12:23] sorry." He said, "No, the devil's been
[12:24] stabbing me." He said, "I'm ready to
[12:26] stab back." Amen. So praise the Lord.
[12:29] Amen. We love the brother and we're so
[12:31] thankful that he's here with us and the
[12:33] Lord laid something on his heart and
[12:34] we're anxious to hear what God has for
[12:37] us. Amen. Really appreciated the song
[12:40] special. Thank all you sisters for that.
[12:42] And it was good to see Noah on the
[12:43] guitar. God bless you. It was good to
[12:45] have you up here. Amen. It's good to
[12:47] have the bird family. Noah's parents are
[12:49] here. Noah's here and Noah's parents are
[12:51] here, too. Brother Jeremy and sister
[12:52] Becky. It's good to have you guys here.
[12:55] Amen. If you guys
[12:57] remember uh a couple weeks ago, I had an
[13:00] announcement for you of an engagement of
[13:01] our brother Wesley Godfrey. But he had
[13:04] he was all alone. But he's not alone
[13:06] today. His fiance is here. Sister Anne
[13:08] Gibbs, would you two stand for us? We
[13:09] want to congratulate you together on
[13:12] your
[13:13] engagement. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[13:18] It was a shame to make him stand all by
[13:20] himself, but not today. Amen. And we're
[13:22] so happy for the two of you. And may the
[13:24] Lord bless you as you make all your
[13:25] final arrangements to be wed this fall.
[13:28] Amen. God bless you. Amen. Also want to
[13:31] remind you tomorrow of the Memorial Day
[13:33] picnic. So, we're so excited for the
[13:35] opportunity to spend some time together
[13:36] again at brother Benjamin and Sister
[13:38] Amanda's place. And so, we're looking
[13:40] forward to that. Also, I want to let you
[13:42] know that brother Kyle Ward's over at
[13:44] Bible believers preaching this Sunday.
[13:46] So, we want to remember him and the
[13:48] assembly there as they're uh having
[13:50] their service this morning as well.
[13:53] Also, we got quite a few visitors here.
[13:55] It's good to have you all here today.
[13:57] Amen. It's good to have brother Marcos
[13:58] from Chile back here. He's visited us a
[14:00] couple times before, but he's in the
[14:02] service again all the way from Chile.
[14:04] God bless you, brother. It's good to
[14:06] have you here. Also, Brother Carson and
[14:08] Sister Sharon Samson, it's good to have
[14:09] you here. And couple sisters that
[14:11] traveled down from Ontario. God bless
[14:12] you. It's good to have you here as well.
[14:14] So, none of these are strangers to us.
[14:16] It's good to have you. And also, Sister
[14:18] Zabilla, she's here again. And she's
[14:20] certainly no stranger to us. So, it's
[14:23] good to have friends come back. Amen.
[14:25] And visit one another. It always means
[14:27] so much to us to be together. Amen.

[17:59] Amen.
[18:02] Christ

[18:26] [Applause]
[18:28] Oh, and

[18:33] others are
[18:36] [Music]
[18:40] holy,
[18:43] do not
[18:45] pass
[18:47] me by.
[18:51] Amen. While we're standing, let's just
[18:52] pray together. Lord Jesus, don't pass us
[18:55] by.
[18:57] Come by, Lord, this morning and speak,
[18:59] Lord Jesus. Come by and hear, Lord
[19:01] Jesus. Who are we, Lord? We put
[19:04] ourselves to one side, Lord Jesus, and
[19:05] ask that you come and take over,
[19:08] Lord. Lord, we're just so thankful that
[19:11] we know that you will not pass us by,
[19:13] Lord Jesus. No one will leave without
[19:15] hearing, having heard something that
[19:17] will encourage us. Lord Jesus, the menu
[19:21] that you feed us is for everyone, from
[19:23] the youngest to the oldest, and we need
[19:25] encouragement. when we're in these
[19:26] bodies. We pray for encouragement, Lord
[19:28] Jesus, to help us on our way. We love
[19:30] you, Lord. Ask a blessing on the
[19:32] service. All is said and done, we just
[19:33] love you, Lord Jesus, and stand before
[19:36] you humbly saying, Lord, take over now,
[19:38] Lord, as we step to one side. We love
[19:40] you, Lord. Amen. Amen. The Lord's good.
[19:44] God bless you
[19:46] all. Thank you, Ry. God bless you all.
[19:50] Yeah, like brother Chad said, I've
[19:52] uh I've been a bit rough, but I'm all
[19:56] good. There's always someone who's a lot
[19:59] worse. And uh when you see brother when
[20:03] we saw Brother Chad in Poland, he was
[20:05] already toasted. When we saw him and he
[20:07] had another week to go, toasted means
[20:11] tired. And you know, I've just got the
[20:15] one service now and I'm a bit fried, but
[20:17] it's all good. The Lord is good. the
[20:19] Lord give us strength. That's what it
[20:21] is. Like if we come to hear from
[20:22] somebody anyway, if we come to hear from
[20:24] a from a man, then we're going to go
[20:25] away pretty disappointed. So, we just
[20:28] want to hear from the Lord. So,
[20:30] greetings also from home. And um I'm
[20:33] presuming that
[20:35] uh the few saints back at home will be
[20:38] listening today as well. And um so we
[20:40] bring greetings from home. It's been
[20:41] nice to see you, nice to be with you.
[20:43] We're flying out this evening, so we're
[20:45] going to um leave sort of pretty much
[20:47] straight after the service. So, like
[20:49] brother Chad says, at least you get to
[20:50] say goodbye to everyone. So, don't just
[20:53] storm out.
[20:55] Just
[20:56] uh Oh, good. Bad mate. Let's go to
[20:59] Ephesians 1 if we can. Ephesians 1. It's
[21:03] uh I don't think I can ever really
[21:07] preach a sermon without reading
[21:08] Ephesians 1 3:5.
[21:11] I think it's just yeah, one of those
[21:13] scriptures that's just
[21:16] mind-blowing. We're thankful for
[21:20] it. Let's read. It says, "Blessed be the
[21:22] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[21:24] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[21:26] blessings in heavenly places in Christ."
[21:29] And if we notice, I think I don't know
[21:31] if I've said this before, but after
[21:33] verse three, it says Christ and it's cut
[21:35] two little dots. That is not a full stop
[21:37] or you would call it
[21:38] a
[21:40] period. It's a Yeah, that's it.
[21:43] Someone's cleverer than
[21:44] me. And after verse four, it's the same
[21:48] thing. And after verse five, it's the
[21:51] same thing. And verse six, there's
[21:52] finally a full stop. Therefore, they all
[21:54] go together. So it says in verse three,
[21:56] blessed be the God and father of our
[21:58] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[22:00] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[22:02] places in Christ, according as he hath
[22:04] chosen us in him before the foundation
[22:06] of the world. Now listen, the blessings
[22:08] that we're looking at here in verse
[22:11] three were blessings before the
[22:14] foundation of the world. Because the way
[22:16] that we're blessed, it says, "He hath
[22:18] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[22:19] in heavenly places in Christ." And then
[22:21] it says according as he hath chosen us.
[22:24] So therefore the the way that we are
[22:26] blessed it's according to the way he has
[22:28] chosen us and he's chosen us before the
[22:29] foundation of the world. So the
[22:31] blessings which he has given us and the
[22:32] blessings which he's pouring out on us
[22:34] we were already blessed with before the
[22:35] world began. As we read then it says
[22:37] according as he has chosen his in before
[22:39] the foundation of the world that we
[22:40] should be holy and without blame before
[22:42] him in love having predestinated unto
[22:44] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[22:47] to himself according to the good
[22:48] pleasure of his will to the praise and
[22:51] glory of his grace wherein he hath made
[22:52] us accepted in the beloved. Amen. Let's
[22:55] just pray for the word. Lord Jesus just
[22:57] break your word to us we pray and just
[22:59] speak Lord encourage us we pray each and
[23:01] every one of us. We love you, Lord. We
[23:03] just want to say thank you, Lord Jesus,
[23:04] for all the things you do for us.
[23:05] Continue now, Lord, feeding us, Lord, we
[23:07] pray. In your name we ask. Amen. So, you
[23:10] may be seated. The Lord's
[23:12] good. Pardon
[23:14] me. Oh, that sounds bad. I'm so sorry.
[23:16] Forgive me. Blake, where's
[23:20] Blake? Where's Blake? Blake's gone.
[23:23] Blake's there somewhere. Anyway, Blake,
[23:26] he's a pro. He kind of flicks the switch
[23:28] and coughs and flicks it back. And
[23:30] forgive me, I I ain't that
[23:33] good. So, our thought this morning is as
[23:36] the amnesia fades, we see from a new
[23:40] perspective. And then we've got a
[23:42] subtitle of speak is what our thought
[23:45] is. As the amnesia fades, we see from a
[23:47] new
[23:48] perspective. Speak. Amen. So, in verse
[23:51] four of this scripture that we've just
[23:53] read, we can see our origin. We know our
[23:55] origin doesn't go back to uh the place
[23:58] that we were born.
[23:59] The or our origin goes back to and this
[24:01] is why I love this scripture so much.
[24:02] Our origin goes back before the
[24:04] foundation of the world. It goes back it
[24:06] goes back
[24:07] to if you're eternal, there's only one
[24:10] eternal, that's God. And if you're going
[24:11] to be eternal or if you are eternal,
[24:13] there's only one way to be eternal, and
[24:14] that is to be a part of God. It's the
[24:16] only way. And folks say, well, you know,
[24:19] I can't get my head around that. Well,
[24:21] neither can I. But it's true. And if you
[24:24] want to know what eternal means, if
[24:26] you're married, take off your wedding
[24:27] ring, look at it, try and find the
[24:28] beginning. You can't find it. There's no
[24:30] beginning, there's no end. That's how it
[24:31] is. But the wedding ring, you can still
[24:32] hold it and look at it. It's real.
[24:34] Although there's no beginning and no
[24:35] end. And that's kind of how it is with
[24:37] us. We can see our origin. So, we know
[24:40] that we're already chosen in him before
[24:41] the foundation of the world. But the
[24:44] scripture is so clear. We know that we
[24:45] can stand up on the scripture. It's the
[24:46] only infallible thing. Am I talking too
[24:49] fast? Good. It's the only infallible
[24:52] thing. um that there is is the word of
[24:55] God.
[24:57] And the problem with this scripture or
[24:59] with us is that we can't remember it. So
[25:03] we read the scripture, we know it's
[25:04] correct. We know that we were in him
[25:06] before the foundation of the world, but
[25:07] we can't remember it. We can't remember
[25:10] it. And this is
[25:13] now if we think about the story of your
[25:16] life and
[25:17] mine, it's like the greatest drama
[25:20] that's ever written.
[25:22] It's like the greatest story that would
[25:25] ever be told. You
[25:27] know, we we wake up to find ourselves
[25:31] and this in another body, if you know
[25:34] what I mean. Like we wake up to find
[25:36] ourselves in in a body in in the body
[25:39] that we're born in. We know nothing. We
[25:40] just wake we wake up to find
[25:43] ourselves having to learn everything. We
[25:45] have no memory of anything before our
[25:47] birth.
[25:48] And you know even though we come from
[25:50] God we still have no we had no idea
[25:53] where we came from. So we were born with
[25:57] amnesia. Now amnesia is
[26:02] um amnesia is a loss of
[26:04] memory but it amnesia is a loss of
[26:08] memory of things that have happened.
[26:10] It's basically a loss of memory things
[26:12] that are real.
[26:15] Okay.
[26:16] though things that have happened to us.
[26:19] If somebody who you were
[26:21] before you you had amnesia, it's it's
[26:24] like a real life. People who have
[26:25] amnesia, they've had a real life. And
[26:28] and amnesia is not a loss of memory of
[26:30] who I wanted to be. Pardon me. Or who I
[26:34] thought I should have been. Oh, and now
[26:36] I've forgotten it. No. Amnesia is is
[26:39] loss of memory of something that is
[26:41] totally real.
[26:43] Yeah. So, so when somebody wakes up,
[26:46] let's just say, Lord forbid, you know, I
[26:49] I wake up
[26:50] and Joe Scott wakes up
[26:54] tomorrow. Joe wakes up tomorrow and um
[26:56] and and he he he's he he said he he he
[27:00] say he says, "Oh, I've got
[27:02] amnesia. I can't remember being that
[27:04] dirt bike rider, you know? I can't
[27:06] remember like I can't remember winning
[27:08] all those races and I' I've just
[27:10] forgotten it. I can't remember doing the
[27:12] big triple. He knows what that is. I
[27:14] can't remember it. That's when you jump
[27:16] like from one end to the other. That's
[27:18] not me either. So he I can't remember it
[27:21] being that that famous world number one.
[27:25] Yeah. The reason you can't remember it
[27:26] is cuz he's not real. Yeah. But like me
[27:29] with the old, you know, I I can remember
[27:33] me riding and he can remember him riding
[27:37] and the memory that he has, it has to
[27:39] have otherwise he's not amnesia. You see
[27:40] what I'm saying? So he can So there's
[27:42] things that I can I can't remember being
[27:44] like the the the farmer with 50,000
[27:46] tractors all parked. I just can't
[27:47] remember it. No, cuz it's not real. It
[27:49] never happened. So it's not amnesia.
[27:51] Amnesia has to be something that has
[27:53] truly happened to us. You know, like
[27:57] tripping over the garden host pipe
[27:59] yesterday. You know, you can remember
[28:01] it, but then next week you would say,
[28:03] "Oh, I've got amnesia for it." Because
[28:05] in theory, you've forgotten it. But it
[28:06] actually did really happen. See what I'm
[28:08] saying? Anyway, you'll see what we're
[28:10] trying to get to. Amen. So amnesia is a
[28:13] loss of memory of real things that
[28:16] happen. Okay. So the scripture we've
[28:19] read this is actually reality.
[28:23] This is reality.
[28:25] And this is truly telling us where we
[28:27] come from. This is actually where we
[28:29] come from. And so we can truly say yes,
[28:32] we were born with amnesia. See, because
[28:34] we can't remember it. We can't remember
[28:37] being in the mind of God and in that
[28:40] whatever form we were in before we just
[28:42] that's why we say in whatever form we
[28:43] were cuz anyone who can remember it just
[28:45] give me a shout and prod my memory you
[28:48] know I can't remember it you know what I
[28:50] mean and neither can you but although
[28:52] it's true
[28:54] so brother Bam says here in in 1965 he
[28:56] says it's is the ris in the rising of
[28:58] the sun it's paragraph 133 to 142 if
[29:02] you're writing it down
[29:04] it's that the story he tells got the
[29:06] chicken, the eagle, and the
[29:09] egg. He says, "My crude little story
[29:11] here about a farmer putting an egg under
[29:14] or the eagle egg under the egg, under
[29:16] the hen." The little eagle was
[29:18] absolutely he was an odd-looking thing,
[29:20] oddlooking creature. When this farmer
[29:22] did the thing that he did, he put the
[29:24] eagle egg under the old hen and he
[29:26] hatched it out a funnyl looking chicken.
[29:28] And it was odd little fellow. He didn't
[29:30] look like them. His feathers wasn't like
[29:32] the rest of them. He was just an odd
[29:34] little guy. All the rest of the chickens
[29:36] recognized him as an odd fellow. And the
[29:38] hen went around and he didn't even like
[29:40] the diet she was feeding him. He didn't
[29:42] like that scratching the barnyard. No,
[29:43] he didn't want how didn't have nothing
[29:45] to do with that. See, he wondered why he
[29:48] had to be the odd one around here.
[29:49] Anyhow, listen. Has anybody ever
[29:51] wondered why you just
[29:52] odd? Do you know what I mean? It's just
[29:55] a joy. Joyce, why are you nodding?
[29:58] Now, if you've got a family, if you've
[30:00] got a family, I mean, you know, I come
[30:01] from a family of believers, but I'm sure
[30:03] if you're born in a family that's that's
[30:05] maybe not believing or whatever, you're
[30:06] just the odd one. Do you know what I
[30:08] mean?
[30:09] And let's let's move
[30:12] on. Okay. He says, "Wonder why you odd
[30:15] one around here anyhow? He never tasted
[30:16] anything like that. He just had to eat
[30:17] to keep him alive because he didn't like
[30:20] the taste of it. See, he wasn't a
[30:21] chicken to begin with. See, and the hen
[30:23] would cluck and you know, the days of
[30:25] miracles has passed. There's no such
[30:26] thing. Join the church." It just didn't
[30:27] hit right with that little guy. So, we
[30:29] followed her head around one day until
[30:31] his mommy. Now, the old eagle, she she
[30:34] had laid so many eggs and there was one
[30:36] of them missing. She knew that the eagle
[30:38] somewhere. So, there's an eagle
[30:40] somewhere. So, she starts out on up to
[30:42] hunt for him. She circled over the
[30:44] mountain top and come down the valleys
[30:46] and over everywhere where he might be by
[30:48] this time. It's time for him to be born.
[30:50] It's time to be hatched. Said, "Maybe a
[30:53] crow came and picked up my egg. Maybe a
[30:54] vulture. I don't know. Something picked
[30:56] up my egg. I know the egg is in my mind.
[30:59] I've got a son somewhere. I've got to
[31:01] hunt him. Listen, brother Brandham, many
[31:04] times we it appears though he's just
[31:06] telling some stories.
[31:09] But actually, when we when we get into
[31:10] the stories and we can truly see our
[31:13] lives in there. So, he's kind of mixing
[31:15] the two. He's blending the two together.
[31:16] He says, you know, the egg is in my
[31:18] mind. I've got a son somewhere. I've got
[31:21] to hunt him. So does God. He is that
[31:23] great eagle. In his thoughts, he knowed
[31:26] he'd have a church. He knowed he'd have
[31:28] a people. No matter what's who what's
[31:30] cuddled them, no matter what was they
[31:33] were hatched out under, he's hunting and
[31:35] he's hunting for his own. One day, the
[31:37] story goes, the old eagle flew over the
[31:39] barnyard. She looked looking everywhere
[31:40] and she found him. Oh, for that re
[31:42] resurrection to recognize that he really
[31:45] wasn't a chicken after all. He was an
[31:47] eagle. He was taught to look down, look
[31:49] for some bug or something in the
[31:50] farmyard, but he heard a scream and that
[31:53] said, "Look up this way and he looked up
[31:55] above him and there was a creature with
[31:56] 14 ft wings powerful than any chicken
[31:58] there was in the barnyard. It claimed
[32:01] him to be her son. He said, "Mama, how
[32:03] can I get to you?" She said, "Just jump.
[32:05] Start flopping your wings for you're an
[32:07] eagle." See, she knew she had a son
[32:10] somewhere. No matter what he's been
[32:12] raised up in, she's got a son somewhere.
[32:14] And God knows. Hallelujah. Listen
[32:16] carefully now. He said he's got a
[32:17] predestinated for ordained church. He
[32:20] knowed he's got sons and daughters and a
[32:22] bride waiting somewhere. When the Holy
[32:25] Spirit begins to fly over that wave
[32:26] sheath, oh my, the same yesterday,
[32:28] today, and forever. Not some mythical
[32:30] story, but in reality, no matter how
[32:32] many tried to tell him an eagle, he
[32:34] didn't know what an eagle was. Yet, he
[32:36] was an eagle. He would not understand it
[32:39] until he seen something that reflected
[32:43] him, that he reflected rather. You see,
[32:46] and now this is this is this is
[32:47] beautiful. You see the story that
[32:50] brother Ram's telling us here is
[32:51] basically describing our lives. Wherever
[32:54] we come from, we never fitted in, you
[32:57] know, and we were born and someone could
[33:00] have said eagle to us, eagle to us. I
[33:02] mean, someone could have said, "Oh, your
[33:03] bride, your bride, your bride to us,"
[33:05] and we wouldn't truly know what that
[33:06] meant until we see something that
[33:08] reflects what we are.
[33:11] You know, we were kind of hatched out in
[33:14] some farmard, wherever it may be, and
[33:17] Ohio, Rocky Top, Brother Bob, Sisters,
[33:22] Sister Suzan. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah.
[33:26] And Rocky Top, Rocky Top, isn't it?
[33:28] Rocky Top Tennessee and or Alabama,
[33:30] wherever it is. Let's face it, we were
[33:32] all born in a farmard. It might have
[33:34] looked different. I don't know where,
[33:36] brother Gabby. You're from Chicago or
[33:37] something. E, no idea.
[33:41] He for a
[33:43] hood. And I was just from I've just I've
[33:46] said it before. Nazareth. That's
[33:48] it. Don't go and look at it on Google.
[33:51] It's like scar bro. That's pretty bad.
[33:53] Yeah. But that's where that's where I
[33:55] was born. So we were all just born in a
[33:57] farmard. Whatever it was. It was just
[34:00] what it was. And we were listen
[34:02] carefully. We were we were not born
[34:06] knowing what we now know about
[34:07] ourselves. When we were born, we we did
[34:10] not know what we now know. You see, but
[34:13] just like the eagle then was born
[34:16] amongst the chickens. Even though he was
[34:18] an eagle from before, listen carefully.
[34:22] Before the foundation of the muck heap
[34:24] that was in the farmyard,
[34:27] farmyard muck heap usually is there for
[34:29] a year and then it disappears and then a
[34:32] year and it disappears. And he was just
[34:33] a little chick. But before the
[34:35] foundation of the mock heep that he was
[34:36] crawling on, he was actually somewhere
[34:39] else before that. He was actually in his
[34:43] mother's nest. And if if you would have
[34:46] tried to explain to the little fell, he
[34:47] wouldn't have had a clue what you were
[34:48] talking about. You see, this is this is
[34:50] the whole thing with amnesia when you
[34:52] just don't know because you just can't
[34:54] remember. Yeah, it it just it look if
[34:57] you if you're taken you're still inside
[34:59] the egg and you're taken from your
[35:01] mother's nest and you're placed under a
[35:03] chicken, how are you ever going to know
[35:06] where you were before? And if someone
[35:09] would come and told him, you come from a
[35:12] nest somewhere, and he like what? He
[35:15] says, yeah, I know. I'm looking at it.
[35:17] No, no, no, no. You weren't born in
[35:19] Scarra. He's like, no, no, no. You you
[35:21] you were a nest. You were way up high.
[35:23] I'm thinking Scarra. Okay, the hospital
[35:25] is on a hill, but what are you talking
[35:27] about? No, you're not getting me. You
[35:30] were born on a rock right at the top.
[35:31] Now I'm thinking, yeah, now you're a bit
[35:33] cuz now there is no how what he think
[35:37] about it. He was inside the egg.
[35:40] We were inside the egg
[35:43] before the foundation of the world. And
[35:46] when we were brought here and we were
[35:48] hatched here, we had no there was no way
[35:52] of us ever remembering. See what I mean?
[35:56] Amen. See, the eagle, the little eagle
[35:59] could not remember being in his mother's
[36:01] nest. He just had the amnesia. And
[36:04] remember, amnesia is a loss of memory
[36:07] that of things that are real. So, this
[36:10] little eagle, I'm going to keep going on
[36:11] about it. The little eagle, he's inside
[36:14] his egg, right? He's in the nest. He's
[36:16] taken out. He's put in the farmyard.
[36:19] He's got amnesia. He doesn't remember
[36:21] being, but actually he has truly got
[36:23] amnesia because he truly was in the an
[36:26] eagle's nest before. He was taken from
[36:29] the eagle's nest. So he be that is true
[36:32] amnesia. We we were born with true
[36:35] amnesia because we were in the nest
[36:38] before. We were in the mind of God. We
[36:40] were a part of God before. We do have a
[36:43] life of before we came here. Yeah. our
[36:48] life if it's eternal then it comes from
[36:50] somewhere we were with God in that form
[36:53] however it was. So the little
[36:56] eagle is a perfect type really of our
[36:59] story. And in the story here in
[37:03] paragraph
[37:04] 142, he says here, "No matter how many
[37:07] tries to tell him, I'm going to
[37:09] try." Sorry, that didn't
[37:13] work. Pardon me. No matter how many
[37:16] tried to tell him an eagle, like you
[37:18] know, you're an eagle. You're an eagle.
[37:20] He didn't know what an eagle was, yet he
[37:23] was an eagle. He could not understand it
[37:25] until he seen something that reflected
[37:27] him that reflected rather.
[37:31] Now, we when we saw something in the
[37:34] word, wherever we were, whatever age we
[37:36] were, because don't forget, you know,
[37:39] we've got to be careful that you don't
[37:40] always exclude the children cuz there's
[37:42] going to be children raptor too, you
[37:44] know.
[37:46] And so, whatever capacity, however you
[37:48] see the word as a child, as an adult, as
[37:51] a as a whatever age you are, you will
[37:54] see something that it's not the flesh.
[37:57] You don't look at the Bible and Samson
[38:00] like this. This would be a Marcus
[38:01] Beckham move. A brother Marcus see
[38:04] Samson with the big muscles. Yeah. And
[38:07] that's me. No, it's not about the
[38:10] outside, but it's about the inside. You
[38:14] see, and and and brother Marcus, myself,
[38:18] anybody, we all look in the word and
[38:20] we're not looking at our outside.
[38:23] We're looking at the inside, man. And so
[38:25] whenever we hear the word as a child, as
[38:27] an adult, whatever you are, the thing
[38:29] that reflects isn't the outside of us.
[38:32] It's the inside.
[38:34] Amen. And this is now why we can be so
[38:37] different. And many people, we can all
[38:39] be so different in so many different
[38:41] ways, but we're all reflecting that one
[38:43] thing. And like I said, it's not the
[38:45] outside, it's the inside, man. Because
[38:47] don't forget, the inside all comes from
[38:48] the same source. Amen. So, so when we
[38:52] see the the um the the reflection of the
[38:56] word, when we hear something, there's
[38:58] something on the inside that reflects
[38:59] back, something eternal that reflects
[39:02] back and and
[39:03] and the amnesia begins to fade. So, the
[39:07] amnesia begins to fade. The amnesia is a
[39:10] state of mind and and it begins to fade
[39:13] and we can and we begin to see with a
[39:15] new perspective. Now, obviously,
[39:18] amnesia, I don't know how it works
[39:20] totally. I don't think it's from one
[39:21] sometimes it can be from one second to
[39:23] the other but I think sometimes it's
[39:25] also like through stages isn't
[39:27] it and you know some sometimes it's like
[39:30] through stages we go through stages and
[39:32] we we the amnesia feeds and we see
[39:35] something more it says amen and as we're
[39:37] kind of changing the amnesia is fading
[39:39] and we're seeing clearer and clearer and
[39:41] the Lord's trying to get to us who we
[39:44] are the Lord is trying to you know we
[39:47] keep hearing that that that eagle I
[39:48] don't know that
[39:50] that noise that make see all the time
[39:53] there's that eagle scream going out and
[39:56] and and and somewhere I mean that should
[39:57] kind of send shivers down your back you
[39:59] know the Holy Spirit's coming
[40:01] over and he's calling out and and and
[40:04] something inside us he's saying Lord I
[40:08] don't understand what it is but there's
[40:10] something pulling on my heart something
[40:13] somewhere and the Lord's trying to call
[40:15] to us and and the eagle scream screams
[40:19] out and There's something on the inside
[40:20] of that little fella. And maybe not then
[40:23] he'll might still be making a kind of
[40:25] like a I don't know like I don't know
[40:27] what the teenage night kind of age
[40:31] whistle from the eagle sounds like.
[40:32] Maybe it's a bit croak
[40:34] like but there's something deep on the
[40:36] inside that eternal part of him that's
[40:39] like whoa whoa whoa. When I get big,
[40:42] when I get into his stature, when I come
[40:46] to the full stature, that's the noise
[40:48] that I'll make, too. There's something
[40:51] eternal coming in there, and that's
[40:53] what's reflecting back. And the Lord's
[40:56] trying to show us. So, the eagle
[40:57] screams, the reason he's screaming out,
[41:00] and I think brother talks about the
[41:01] little eagle, it's all coming together
[41:02] as well. When the eagle screams out,
[41:05] it's gathering them together because
[41:06] it's speaking to the heart of the
[41:07] children. And when the Lord gathers us
[41:09] together, he screams out with something
[41:11] eternal. And something that screams out,
[41:14] there's something inside us. It's just,
[41:16] yes, that's it. That's it. That's a part
[41:18] of me. So the Lord's trying to show us
[41:20] through that scream, through the word
[41:23] that's preached, through the word that's
[41:24] brought to us, he's showing us our
[41:27] identity.
[41:28] The Lord's trying to show us our
[41:30] identity. We are eagles,
[41:34] you know. We are born to fly.
[41:38] We were born to fly. We are born to s
[41:41] for our for our spiritual for our soul
[41:45] to soar in the heavenlies. We are
[41:47] supposed to to fly higher each day.
[41:50] We're supposed to keep flying. Listen,
[41:52] we're in the seventh church age. We know
[41:55] all these things. With the seventh
[41:57] church age, there comes this new
[41:59] anointing. You know, up through the
[42:01] seven church ages, there's the four
[42:03] anointings that's been on. the lion, the
[42:05] ox, the man, and lastly, the eagle. I
[42:09] just want to turn to Revelations
[42:12] 4:7. Revelations 4:7. It's just
[42:15] literally, we're not going to go into
[42:16] this. It says, "The first beast was like
[42:18] a lion. The second beast was like a
[42:20] calf. The third beast, the face of a
[42:23] man, and the fourth beast was a flying
[42:26] eagle." Now notice we want to see here
[42:29] the Lord is saying specifically it's not
[42:32] just an eagle but it's a flying eagle.
[42:36] You see it's it's and listen carefully.
[42:38] If it's a flying eagle that means it's a
[42:42] mature eagle cuz the babies can't fly.
[42:46] So the the anointing that's on us it's
[42:49] this flying eagle. Amen. And the Lord's
[42:54] good. Listen, the first three
[42:57] anointings, we all know this, but the
[42:58] first three anointings are earthbound,
[43:01] but but the but the last anointing, the
[43:03] Lord's showing us that the anointing
[43:04] that's on the bride, and listen, you got
[43:07] to be careful. Don't just sit there and
[43:08] say, "Oh, amen. Praise the Lord." No,
[43:10] no, no, no. Say, "Amen. Praise the
[43:11] Lord." Because he's talking about you.
[43:14] So, listen, the anointing that is on you
[43:16] personally is this flying eagle. Don't
[43:20] forget, when the anointing's poured out,
[43:21] it's splashed over. It's splashed over
[43:23] the bride. We we're surrounded by this
[43:25] anointing. We're anointed to fly higher.
[43:29] And you know this the anointing comes
[43:31] with a new
[43:33] perspective. I'm just going to draw
[43:35] something, brother
[43:37] Franco. Um let's give this a whirl.
[43:40] So, you know what's awesome is in the in
[43:44] the uh obviously as the anointings go
[43:46] through, they're all they're all, you
[43:48] know, the the the lion, the ox, and then
[43:50] you got you got the martyrdom, you got
[43:52] the uh reformers, but the flying eagle
[43:54] is the time when when we fly higher. So,
[43:59] there's all sorts of I'm just going to
[44:01] I'm just going to uh draw something
[44:02] here. So, we've got it's a nice little
[44:04] uh picture.
[44:07] Okay, this is this is supposed to
[44:12] be a block of
[44:14] flats. I don't think you got blocks of
[44:16] blocks of flats around here. Maybe you
[44:18] do. This is
[44:20] town. Okay, sweet. And this is
[44:24] actually it's a walled
[44:27] city.
[44:29] Okay.
[44:31] Right. Sweet.
[44:37] Okay. Okay. So, back
[44:41] in Luther's
[44:43] day, you know, this was Luther standing
[44:46] here. This is Luther standing here. Now,
[44:50] don't forget this
[44:52] city is all the truths of the Bible. I
[44:56] don't have space otherwise I it doesn't
[44:57] matter. It's all true things. True. The
[45:01] truth, right? So this is now
[45:04] Wesley. This is Luther. Sorry. Now his
[45:07] angle of
[45:09] view is like
[45:12] uh like that. See
[45:16] that?
[45:18] Okay. And it's a slither through there.
[45:22] That's his angle of view. Does that make
[45:23] sense to you? That's that's his uh
[45:25] oblinkle. That's his uh where he can
[45:28] see. Okay. So now you've got another one
[45:30] here on the on the right hand side.
[45:32] And I'm going to say this is Wesley.
[45:34] Okay. So now Wesley's looking here now.
[45:37] And Wesley can see this one. He can't
[45:40] see. Can you see the dot on there as
[45:42] well? Can you see the dot where I'm
[45:43] moving the thing or not? No. So he can't
[45:46] see the top small house. Okay. But he
[45:48] can see this one. He can see this one.
[45:50] He can see this one. He can't he can
[45:52] maybe see between these buildings. And
[45:55] he and he can see through here. He can
[45:57] just clinch the bottom of this one
[45:58] maybe. So, so we see that in each church
[46:02] age we've been given so much. So, Luther
[46:05] can see so much. Wesley can see so much.
[46:07] And uh it's a little bit like that
[46:11] today.
[46:13] Um in and around the message, you might
[46:15] say message message because some people
[46:17] can see one thing that's that's that's
[46:19] how it should be, black and white, you
[46:21] know, clearly. Other people maybe don't
[46:23] see that. And and so sometimes you might
[46:27] go somewhere and might believe something
[46:28] a little bit different or whatever and
[46:30] it's basically cuz they haven't flown
[46:31] high enough.
[46:33] See, don't forget that all this inside
[46:36] this city, everything is real.
[46:40] Everything is true. Everything is is is
[46:42] full. Um
[46:44] the So if we go a little bit higher
[46:46] here, look, the eagle the eagle is
[46:49] flying. I I can't I can't draw an eagle.
[46:52] The eagle's flying high enough and let's
[46:55] go for a yellow. Where's the yellow? The
[46:58] eagle now he looks down over the whole
[47:01] thing. See what I mean? So basically on
[47:04] this in the seventh church age, this
[47:07] eagle anointing. It's not it's this
[47:09] flying higher. We can now we're seeing
[47:12] clearly. We can see the truths of the
[47:15] Bible. And the eagle also don't forget
[47:18] he isn't like plotting around on the
[47:19] floor bumping into the walls. He can
[47:21] just move left or right a little bit as
[47:23] the spirit of the Lord is leading. He's
[47:25] kind of looking down and he can see and
[47:28] describe what the truths of the Bible
[47:31] are. And we're under this anointing,
[47:33] too. The Lord has made us flexible
[47:35] enough that we can actually move left
[47:37] and right a little bit. We're flexible.
[47:38] You know, when like brother M says um
[47:40] about the uh the the wine in the new
[47:44] bottles or whatever in the leather
[47:45] pouches, it just stretches out. And
[47:46] somebody says something, it's like,
[47:47] well, that's true. Yeah. Amen. It kind
[47:49] of stretches. It moves a little bit.
[47:50] That's the flexibility um of of our
[47:52] souls. We can take what the Lord's
[47:54] saying to us. And so we fly left and
[47:56] right a little bit. It's like somebody
[47:57] says, "Oh, what about this, brother?"
[47:58] It's like, you know, that's so true.
[48:00] Praise the Lord. I never heard that
[48:01] before. So, we get this view looking
[48:03] down on something. We are not bound
[48:06] to a single way of looking at things. We
[48:09] can see the whole thing clearly. And
[48:11] again, that's why we have the different
[48:12] ministries the Lord's put in the church
[48:14] so that we can also um benefit from them
[48:16] to see this uh new perspective as the
[48:20] amnesia fades, as we fly higher. We're
[48:23] seeing from a new perspective. We're
[48:25] seeing the whole thing as as a as a as a
[48:29] whole. Amen. So, we're not looking from
[48:32] the farmyard anymore. And I'm not saying
[48:34] Luther and Wes are in the farmard, but
[48:36] when you're in the farmard, you don't
[48:37] have that angle. You know, I I often
[48:39] think I don't often think, but I have
[48:41] thought in the past, you know, how is it
[48:43] for somebody who's small, a little kid,
[48:44] because I've forgotten what their view
[48:47] is. You know, we got these little dog.
[48:50] We've got a little Jack Russell dog
[48:52] and the world looks different to him.
[48:55] True story. Yeah. He's looking up at
[48:57] everything. It's like I'm massive to
[48:59] him, you know, but for me, he's kind of
[49:01] small. So, how does it look? Well, if
[49:03] you're in the farmyard, if you're
[49:04] looking, you all you're seeing is the
[49:06] things on the floor around you. But if
[49:08] you could just raise that little bit
[49:10] higher, then we can see things clearly.
[49:12] Amen. Get a new perspective. Amen. So,
[49:16] we're born to fly. Amen. And as we're
[49:19] flying, the further we see, we see
[49:22] further the higher we fly. Just go to
[49:24] brother and says in 1962
[49:27] countdown. I really don't know how to
[49:30] turn the microphone off. I'm so sorry.
[49:34] So, I've got it inside my pocket as
[49:36] well. I don't have it on my belt like
[49:38] everybody else. Miriam's making faces at
[49:40] me. I'm in
[49:41] trouble. All
[49:44] good. All good. Brother says, he says,
[49:48] "We are we all love to talk about Isuza
[49:50] Street. We all love to talk about 50
[49:52] years
[49:54] ago." And I fussed with you. Listen,
[49:56] we've moved on from 20 years ago. You've
[49:59] still got people that are saying, "Yeah,
[50:00] well, you know, 30 years ago, we saw
[50:02] this and we" It's like, "Yeah, that's
[50:04] nice. That's real nice." But the eagle
[50:07] keeps flying higher. The higher we go,
[50:09] we see more. So, stop looking back at
[50:11] what we saw. Look at what we're seeing
[50:13] now. So, what says, he says, "We love to
[50:15] talk about street. We love to talk about
[50:17] 50 years ago. And I fussed with you all
[50:19] week telling you where we and how far
[50:22] we've lost off from there. But we're so
[50:24] advanced in the spirit of God into other
[50:27] things that we got now that they never
[50:30] even had back there. That's what we're
[50:33] seeing here. They just they they've just
[50:36] left the automobile. They've got the
[50:37] feet off the air so they could have a
[50:39] few spiritual gifts, speaking in
[50:40] tongues, shouting and singing spiritual
[50:42] songs. And they were floating around up
[50:43] there like butterflies. Certainly, sure.
[50:45] That was a great age. But oh brother, we
[50:47] are lifted far beyond that now. The
[50:49] church is way beyond that. the spiritual
[50:52] church. It's in the eagle age now. The
[50:55] astronaut flying on above looking down
[50:57] on the fellow citizen chicken sea. We're
[50:59] far above that. Way up yonder in the
[51:01] heavenlies where Christ becomes the full
[51:04] thing that takes completely over and
[51:06] lives his life and acts through you
[51:08] exactly like he did on earth.
[51:12] Amen. So we see we're flying up yonder
[51:15] and looking down. And notice, I want you
[51:18] to notice now that when you fly
[51:21] higher, when you fly higher Oh, my
[51:27] bad. Oh, did I just
[51:31] [Music]
[51:33] Franco?
[51:36] Franco, my pens have
[51:38] disappeared. What do I do?
[51:42] Hey,
[51:44] oh, Brother Franco's doing it.
[51:47] Excellent. Thank you.
[51:51] Awesome. Okay. So, so Okay. So,
[51:55] when when the eagle flies
[51:59] higher, this is a little person down
[52:02] here. Okay. When the eagle flies higher,
[52:06] you can see further. Okay. So, the guy
[52:09] down here, he can maybe
[52:11] see like to there realistically. We can
[52:15] put a few mountains and stuff in there
[52:17] just make it a bit more realistic. So he
[52:19] can see and even put a tree here. He
[52:22] could see this far. That's it. But the
[52:24] eagle when he's up here, he can see far.
[52:26] He can see further. And the point is is
[52:29] that we can see with the spiritual eyes
[52:31] the Lord's given us. We can actually
[52:34] see where we're going, which would be
[52:36] the new Jerusalem. This is my new
[52:38] Jerusalem here. The four the four rivers
[52:40] coming out there. And there's
[52:43] uh there's brother
[52:46] John in in the new Jerusalem. Amen. So
[52:49] we can see further that way. But listen,
[52:52] if you can see, listen, it's not it's
[52:54] not hard to understand. If I can see
[52:56] five miles in that direction, if I turn
[52:59] around, I can also see five miles in
[53:00] that direction. So the higher we fly,
[53:04] it's not just all about seeing where
[53:05] we've come from or where we're going,
[53:07] but you can see both because our
[53:09] identity is wrapped up in both of these
[53:11] things. So we actually see here before
[53:13] the foundation of the world. We can see
[53:17] all the way back here as well. We can
[53:19] see where we come from. We see where
[53:21] we're going. I think there's that song,
[53:22] isn't there? You know, I can see where I
[53:24] open the seals of my life. See where I'm
[53:26] come from. See where I'm going. We can
[53:28] see that. We we we we see our identity.
[53:31] The higher we fly, the more of our
[53:33] identity we're finding out. The amnesia
[53:36] is fading. The amnesia is fading all the
[53:38] time. The Lord is wanting us to see
[53:42] more. He's wanting us to see further
[53:44] because he's saying come up hither. So
[53:47] if we the higher we go, the Lord never
[53:49] ever ever pushes us down and says you
[53:51] just stay down there now. He always
[53:54] wants us to come higher. He always
[53:56] listen you
[53:58] know the
[54:00] Lord the Lord is in partnership with
[54:03] man. It's like Queen Esther the the king
[54:08] Osorus gives says you can have up to
[54:11] half of my kingdom. And it's the per
[54:14] it's and the Lord Jesus we are joint
[54:16] hes. Listen if we're joint heirs joint
[54:19] means 50/50.
[54:21] Joint doesn't mean 4951.
[54:25] If it's joint, it's if it's joint, it
[54:27] means that it's 50/50. And we are joint
[54:30] hes with Christ. So, it's not like the
[54:32] Lord's just saying, listen, you just
[54:33] stay like two steps down and and you
[54:35] know, I'll be up. Not Notice in
[54:37] Revelations uh three um
[54:40] uh talk about the ladies in church. He
[54:42] says, "I grant I'll grant I will sit
[54:44] with you in my throne." He doesn't say
[54:47] the Lord doesn't say, "Listen, you can
[54:48] just sit at my feet." The Lord doesn't
[54:50] say you can sit, you know, just kind of
[54:52] you you just stay down there. He says,
[54:54] "You will sit with me in my throne
[54:56] because we are joint hes with Christ."
[54:58] Like brother Marcus said, you know, if
[55:01] we if he's the king of glory, we're the
[55:04] queen of glory. It's this joint hes.
[55:07] It's this 50/50. And so the Lord wants
[55:09] us to come up to the level he's on. You
[55:13] know what I mean? He doesn't want us to
[55:14] just stay down. So when he's saying come
[55:16] up hither, he's constantly asking us to
[55:18] come up higher. And the higher we fly,
[55:20] the more we see. Amen. So the bride,
[55:24] she's flying so high in the spirit that
[55:27] she leaves everything behind. All the
[55:28] world, the fusses and cares and you know
[55:31] we we we we end up flying so high that
[55:33] we even leave ourselves behind. You know
[55:36] we leave ourselves the thing that we
[55:37] struggle with all the time. It's like we
[55:40] just leave that behind and we just go
[55:41] higher. You know the the part of us that
[55:45] still wants to be a chicken. Oh come on.
[55:48] You know read between the lines. Brother
[55:49] man's talking about the chicken in the
[55:51] farmyard. He's talking about eating
[55:53] worms and scratchy to the muck heap.
[55:55] Well, everything the world's got to
[55:56] offer is just muck. Come on. And the
[55:58] Lord's calling us away from that. He
[56:00] says, "Come away from you. Come out and
[56:02] be separate. Touch." Listen carefully.
[56:04] The scripture says, "Come out from among
[56:06] them and be separate." It says, "Touch
[56:09] not the unclean thing and I will receive
[56:12] you." It's got a condition on it. It
[56:16] says, "Touch not the unclean thing." You
[56:17] can, it's true story. He says, "Touch
[56:19] not the unclean thing and I will receive
[56:22] you." You see, he wants us to be clean.
[56:24] He wants us to be washed. He's doing all
[56:26] the work. He's bring us and he wants us
[56:27] to be up there on the same level as him.
[56:30] Amen. So, we've got to leave ourselves
[56:32] behind. Any part of us that still wants
[56:34] to be scratching around in the muck of
[56:36] the world, we got to drop it. Get rid of
[56:38] it. Gone. You
[56:41] know, okay. It's important to understand
[56:45] the anointing that's on us that's around
[56:48] us because it affects us in our daily
[56:50] life. Sometimes we don't understand, you
[56:54] know, we probably never will understand
[56:55] the full effect of this anointing that's
[56:58] on the age, this eagle age. You know, I
[57:00] want just quickly before we carry on, I
[57:03] just want to read this. Brother says
[57:04] here in the sixth seal,
[57:08] uh, sixth
[57:10] seal, brother one says, it says,
[57:12] "Father, today we stand here by your
[57:14] grace. It's not because that it's a
[57:16] special people, but it's because just
[57:19] like the day of the lion or the ox or
[57:20] the man, pardon, it's the eagle time.
[57:25] It's the anointing of the hour. It's the
[57:27] time we're living in. It's the working
[57:29] of the Holy Spirit for this particular
[57:31] time to prove that Jesus is not dead.
[57:34] The things that he said he would do just
[57:36] before the evening lights went out. And
[57:38] we're here seeing him do that right down
[57:40] along the road. Brother saying it's the
[57:43] eagle time. He's saying it's the
[57:45] anointing of the hour. It's the time
[57:47] we're living in. You know, we almost get
[57:52] too we get too used to living in the
[57:55] spirit under this anointing. Yeah, we
[57:59] sometimes when's the last time that you
[58:01] brethren sat down and started talking
[58:03] about serpent seed? It's just amazing,
[58:05] isn't it? I mean, who would have thought
[58:07] it? It's amazing. It's
[58:09] like, you know, it's just like what? We
[58:12] don't even talk about these things
[58:13] anymore. True story. We these things we
[58:15] all just we just know these things and
[58:17] it's like every day and we almost get
[58:20] used to living in this in this under
[58:23] this anointing where we can just see so
[58:25] much.
[58:26] We just it's almost like we take it for
[58:28] granted. I don't know if you have that
[58:29] expression here. We just it's just like
[58:30] well it's it's normal and you know I
[58:34] could describe it like I've got to be
[58:36] careful. You see I it's like driving a
[58:38] car and you're doing 70
[58:40] mph. I actually thought when I was
[58:42] making this note I thought oh you know
[58:44] Germany and sister I've just seen her
[58:46] there. But in Germany there's a lot of
[58:48] places there's no speed limit. So we
[58:51] don't speed. When we go to Germany, you
[58:53] speed according to your car
[58:56] or how brave you are, whatever. But
[58:59] there's no there's no speed limit. So
[59:01] when you're in Germany, it's a big old
[59:02] country. So you you maybe do 100, 120,
[59:06] whatever it is, and
[59:08] just and when you sit there and you
[59:11] drive for four or five hours and you're
[59:13] doing 100 miles an hour, 120, you slow
[59:16] down to 80 miles an hour and it just
[59:20] feels like you just let go of the
[59:21] steering wheel. like, "Oh,
[59:23] seriously." True. True story. Is that
[59:26] right, Sabilla? True story. Yeah, that's
[59:28] how it is. You just get so used to it.
[59:31] And and then you slow down. It's like,
[59:33] are you for
[59:34] real? And you look down, it's like 75.
[59:37] And I think, yeah, but in England, we're
[59:39] only allowed to drive 70 anyway, so that
[59:42] would actually be normal. But because
[59:44] you get used to it, it's just normal.
[59:46] You see what I mean? But maybe the first
[59:48] time when you take it up to that speed,
[59:49] you think, "Oh, mate, this is going a
[59:51] bit fast." But you soon get used to it.
[59:52] And it's kind of like that with us. You
[59:54] kind of get used to it. Um, see, you
[59:58] you'll be on the motorway maybe and even
[1:00:00] in in in America, then you're doing your
[1:00:01] 70
[1:00:03] and the road works come, you slow down
[1:00:06] to 60. It feels like you stood still.
[1:00:10] It's like seriously because we just get
[1:00:12] so used to We get used to it pretty
[1:00:14] quickly. pretty quickly we get used to
[1:00:17] things and it's meanwhile if Henry Ford
[1:00:21] could have done 60 mph he'd have been
[1:00:23] like whoa do you know what I
[1:00:27] mean I think brother Baron tells about
[1:00:29] the old Model T doing like 15 miles an
[1:00:31] hour or something you know I mean most
[1:00:33] Fords will probably do that now what
[1:00:34] brother
[1:00:36] John it's okay it's okay it's fine I'm
[1:00:39] on your
[1:00:40] side but do you know what I mean it's
[1:00:42] like back in the day brother the Rams
[1:00:45] Dave and there have been cars where you
[1:00:48] know 45 and she's she's she she's
[1:00:50] topping out at 45 and and now cars
[1:00:52] that'll just do it's like what? But you
[1:00:55] see everything's gotten faster.
[1:00:57] Everything's gotten faster. You know,
[1:01:00] technology is the same. Technology these
[1:01:04] days, I mean, I've got my arms down. Who
[1:01:07] knows how to deal with
[1:01:08] technology? Who knows how to turn the
[1:01:10] computer on? Yeah, there you are.
[1:01:13] Exactly. If the co if Anony's computer
[1:01:17] takes 30 seconds longer to boot up,
[1:01:21] throw it in the bin. What? 30 seconds?
[1:01:26] Seriously? True story. Yeah. If it takes
[1:01:28] What is it? It's just like come on. You
[1:01:30] know what I mean? Because And why is it
[1:01:32] that you come on? It's like come on.
[1:01:34] Why? Because we get so used to it being
[1:01:37] a certain speed. It's like everything's
[1:01:39] getting faster and and
[1:01:41] truly everything's sped up and we get
[1:01:45] used to it and as soon as it slows down
[1:01:47] it's like meanwhile back in the day have
[1:01:49] you ever stopped and thought with one
[1:01:52] person's mobile phone in here you know
[1:01:55] world wars 50 60 70 years ago could have
[1:01:58] been solved think about it you know the
[1:02:00] technology when you see what they did
[1:02:02] what one mobile phone can do the the
[1:02:05] information that goes in and out the all
[1:02:07] the whole world trade like in the 40s
[1:02:10] and 50s would have gone through one
[1:02:11] mobile phone. You see what I mean? It's
[1:02:14] just it's just mindblowing. My dad my
[1:02:15] dad when he was um probably Anony's age,
[1:02:18] he worked in um in London in a insurance
[1:02:21] something or something and it was
[1:02:23] insurance company or something. They
[1:02:24] were just transforming over to
[1:02:26] computers. Everything was going to be
[1:02:28] digital and I think it was on cards,
[1:02:30] stamped cards. And he does anybody in
[1:02:33] here know about that stuff? Yeah, there
[1:02:35] we go. He tells me this story. They they
[1:02:38] were the they were the newest thing
[1:02:39] ever. And all the customer cards that
[1:02:41] was all handwritten, they were inputed
[1:02:43] into this computer. And this computer
[1:02:45] was like the size of a house almost and
[1:02:49] basically it was just dots and dashes
[1:02:53] and that was it. It's like, can you
[1:02:55] imagine like information that goes on
[1:02:57] one mobile phone? We've got all the
[1:02:59] messages on one phone and it takes up
[1:03:01] like how many gigabytes is it kids?
[1:03:04] What? like 2 3 GB and your phone's got
[1:03:07] like 512. It's like what? Well, like
[1:03:10] shelves and shelves of tapes and books
[1:03:12] and it's all just on a phone. It's just
[1:03:14] see what I mean? Everything's just got
[1:03:16] so fast and we get used to it. If if if
[1:03:20] Brother Franco if he didn't sort that
[1:03:23] thing out as quick as he did, I would
[1:03:25] have been upset. Do you? It's just
[1:03:27] everything's f Why? Why? What's taking
[1:03:29] so long? Come on. Let's Let's be on.
[1:03:32] Let's Let's go. All good. Anyway, we get
[1:03:35] used to we get used to it and anything
[1:03:37] less than full speed isn't acceptable
[1:03:40] anymore.
[1:03:41] But that's how it is in this eagle age
[1:03:43] for us. We I get used to flying so high.
[1:03:48] Yeah.
[1:03:50] And the things that we see, we just get
[1:03:52] we get used to like I said, we don't
[1:03:53] discuss these anymore. We don't talk
[1:03:56] about things like like you know the
[1:03:58] foundational things because it's just
[1:04:00] well you know there there's other things
[1:04:03] we've we've gone higher and it still
[1:04:05] doesn't mean it's gone away. Don't
[1:04:06] forget that this picture here don't
[1:04:07] forget that this one here these things
[1:04:08] still remain. You we don't talk about
[1:04:11] it's our foundation is still there. It's
[1:04:12] still true. So it's not like oh no we
[1:04:14] don't need that anymore. No no no it's
[1:04:15] just there but we're moving on. We're
[1:04:17] moving higher. So we get so used, don't
[1:04:21] forget the scripture says, it says in
[1:04:22] Luke 10, turn to Luke 10:23 and 24, that
[1:04:26] the things that we are seeing, the
[1:04:28] prophets longed to see. It says here in
[1:04:31] Luke
[1:04:32] 10, Luke
[1:04:35] 10, forgive me. Truly forgive me. I know
[1:04:37] you love
[1:04:40] me. I feel really bad. I'm still
[1:04:42] sweating and everything, but it's all
[1:04:44] good. The Lord is good. And sister
[1:04:47] Susanna would have said,
[1:04:52] "Tmi, it's all good. We love the Lord."
[1:04:56] Uh, so 10 Luke 10:23-24. She taught me
[1:04:59] that the other
[1:05:00] day. I'm also learning. 23- 24 it says,
[1:05:05] "And he turned unto them his disciples
[1:05:07] and said privately, blessed are the eyes
[1:05:09] which see the things that ye see.
[1:05:12] For I tell you that many prophets and
[1:05:14] kings have desired to see those things
[1:05:15] which ye see and have not seen them. To
[1:05:18] hear those things which ye hear and have
[1:05:20] not heard them. You know,
[1:05:23] just Henry Ford longed to see a car that
[1:05:28] did 25 miles an hour.
[1:05:31] You
[1:05:32] know, that's the natural side of things.
[1:05:36] Here in the spiritual side, it says many
[1:05:38] prophets and kings. We're talking about
[1:05:41] prophets back in the day
[1:05:44] who we just look at. We're like Elijah,
[1:05:49] you know, Elisha, Jeremiah, all these
[1:05:51] ones. They the see like the prophet,
[1:05:53] many prophets would love to see in
[1:05:55] detail the things that we see. Kings,
[1:06:00] kings and prophets, the ones who the
[1:06:02] word of the Lord came to in part.
[1:06:05] But now because of this eagle anointing
[1:06:09] we can we've been shown these things
[1:06:11] clearly and and for us it's just like
[1:06:14] well the computer's taking 30 seconds
[1:06:15] longer let's you know it what sometimes
[1:06:19] we get used to it sometimes we get used
[1:06:22] to it sometimes you
[1:06:25] know for us it becomes almost too normal
[1:06:29] does anybody you don't put your hand up
[1:06:32] does anybody ever get depressed
[1:06:35] Does anybody ever feel down? You see, I
[1:06:38] can tell you now that we most people
[1:06:40] most people we have our ups and downs,
[1:06:42] but sometimes there's people that they
[1:06:45] kind of get real depressed, real
[1:06:46] depressed, real down, real and many of
[1:06:51] us feel that way, but it doesn't mean
[1:06:54] that you're lost. You see, this is why
[1:06:55] it's so important to understand the
[1:06:57] anointing that's under us this this day.
[1:07:00] Pardon me if I can just draw you this
[1:07:03] little picky. See this this is quite
[1:07:04] nice this picture.
[1:07:06] So this is you. This little guy at the
[1:07:09] bottom. This is you. The one whoever
[1:07:10] feels like down and the here
[1:07:14] now I looked at what the tallest
[1:07:16] building is in America and I couldn't
[1:07:17] get it. So this is the Empire State
[1:07:20] Building.
[1:07:21] Huh? It used to be the big one, didn't
[1:07:23] it? Yeah. Okay. So that's the Empire
[1:07:27] State Building. So you go to church on
[1:07:30] Sunday and the Lord, you know, listen,
[1:07:33] it's not always the huge revelations
[1:07:35] that really touch our hearts that help
[1:07:37] us along the way. Sometimes it's just a
[1:07:39] tiny little drop. But I always say if
[1:07:41] one word from the Lord, if brother Ram
[1:07:43] said when he saw the vision of the Lord,
[1:07:45] when he saw the Lord in the vision form,
[1:07:47] he said he it just one look from him
[1:07:49] would turn the world upside down. So if
[1:07:52] the Lord one word, imagine what one word
[1:07:55] from the Lord could do. So if we just go
[1:07:57] home with one word, it's more than I
[1:08:00] could ever say. We go to church on
[1:08:02] Sunday and the Lord drops something in
[1:08:04] our heart and this is this is us here
[1:08:07] and
[1:08:11] immediately our um I'm going to draw it
[1:08:13] in pink cuz it's too can't see it.
[1:08:15] Immediately we
[1:08:18] saw so
[1:08:21] high in our spirit. We're right up to
[1:08:24] that level. Remember that's the Empire
[1:08:25] State
[1:08:26] Building. And immediately we're right up
[1:08:30] there. We're in the spirit and we're
[1:08:32] seeing the things that the prophets and
[1:08:34] the kings long to see. But because we're
[1:08:36] in the
[1:08:38] flesh, flesh, Monday morning, Tuesday
[1:08:42] morning, there's fleshy things that come
[1:08:43] along and we we've got to go back to
[1:08:45] daily life. And we actually come down.
[1:08:48] Now, I just want you to see this nicely.
[1:08:50] So we're right up here in the spirit in
[1:08:52] the heavenlies is with that eagle
[1:08:53] anointing and now suddenly we come down
[1:08:57] and we're about here and we're up and
[1:09:00] down. So now the whole point with this
[1:09:02] whole
[1:09:05] um sorry brother the whole point see now
[1:09:09] we've come down and we're on
[1:09:11] this oh that's it. It's the end. It's
[1:09:15] the end. We're totally it feels like
[1:09:17] Monday Tuesday morning. It feels like we
[1:09:19] are so lost. It feels like we're so
[1:09:21] depressed. It feels like we're down.
[1:09:23] It's like the end of the world. Because
[1:09:26] we humans now, this is the problem with
[1:09:28] humans is now Monday morning, we've been
[1:09:30] we've had we've had services. I think
[1:09:32] the kids last Sunday with Marcus,
[1:09:33] brother Marcus, and then in the
[1:09:34] afternoon they had and they were right
[1:09:36] up there. Oh, Monday, Tuesday, something
[1:09:38] might have happened and next thing
[1:09:40] they're down and they're just floating
[1:09:42] along. Oh, you know, and because we're
[1:09:46] human beings, we tend to find we tend to
[1:09:49] look for a reason why, you know, oh,
[1:09:51] I've got a headache. Why? Why? We've
[1:09:54] always got to have an explanation for
[1:09:56] everything. So, oh, I'm
[1:09:59] depressed. I'm depressed.
[1:10:04] Meanwhile, you've just been driving on
[1:10:06] the autoban doing 120 and now you've
[1:10:10] slowed down to 70, which for everyone
[1:10:13] else is normal.
[1:10:17] We are not normal people. We're eagles.
[1:10:20] See, we get carried away. Meanwhile,
[1:10:23] your
[1:10:24] neighbor, your neighbor's here. Yeah.
[1:10:27] And when he's up and down, I'll draw it
[1:10:29] in green. When he's up and down, he's
[1:10:32] like this. And when he's good, he's like
[1:10:35] this. See what I mean? So, actually,
[1:10:38] you've just come down to you're so used
[1:10:41] to being up there. And this isn't this
[1:10:44] is why I think people say the the
[1:10:46] convention blues or something is it. So,
[1:10:48] is that right? It's like you're up there
[1:10:50] and it's just surrounded by Christians
[1:10:52] and he's just talking out the word.
[1:10:53] You're singing psalms and it's just
[1:10:56] right. And then you're back to life
[1:10:58] again. you got to go to work with
[1:11:00] the big hairy tattooed guys and it's
[1:11:04] just like oh lord you know and but but
[1:11:07] actually when we're so up cuz when we go
[1:11:11] up we don't just go up we go up and so
[1:11:16] and when we come down we're actually oh
[1:11:18] we're only coming down you're not
[1:11:19] depressed we're not down we just come
[1:11:21] down to like the normal what's normal
[1:11:23] for normal people you know
[1:11:27] yesterday morning went to Walmart and uh
[1:11:32] does this guy everyone's so friendly
[1:11:33] here. Everyone's so friendly. So we
[1:11:35] we're walking down and there's this I
[1:11:36] think that's is it when you order stuff
[1:11:38] on the internet somebody goes around
[1:11:39] with a
[1:11:40] trolley and there's this there's this
[1:11:42] dude and he's he's pushing his trolley
[1:11:44] and we stood to one side and he said oh
[1:11:46] he said how you going there and we were
[1:11:48] like good. Yeah you he said I'm doing
[1:11:53] real
[1:11:55] good. And I was like, "Mate, this guy's
[1:11:58] so friendly." But actually, he said,
[1:12:00] "I'm doing pretty good." Yeah, really
[1:12:02] good. And he was just so happy. And I
[1:12:05] just thought, mate, this he was
[1:12:07] genuinely super happy. You know what I
[1:12:10] mean? I mean, he's in in worldly terms,
[1:12:14] he was up there. And don't forget up
[1:12:15] there is like where the two lines meet.
[1:12:18] So, he was up there. And I thought if a
[1:12:22] worldly chap can feel so happy pushing
[1:12:24] one of those shopping carts, how happy
[1:12:26] should we be? How happy should we be?
[1:12:29] You know, the point is we just get so
[1:12:31] high we come down to what their absolute
[1:12:34] happy is. You know what I mean? In our
[1:12:36] spiritual side, maybe maybe you're
[1:12:38] feeling dodgy, you know, sick or
[1:12:39] something and you might not be feeling
[1:12:40] that good, but in your spirit, even when
[1:12:42] you're feeling sick, you don't feel like
[1:12:43] down and oh, no one loves me, the Lord
[1:12:45] doesn't love me. Oh, we're just always
[1:12:47] so if how much happier should we be? I
[1:12:51] mean this this the people are just so
[1:12:53] people are so happy just with normal
[1:12:55] jobs we should be super super happy.
[1:12:58] Amen.
[1:13:01] See when we start to
[1:13:03] see something in the eternal word
[1:13:05] something so simple and it anchors in
[1:13:08] our hearts and suddenly we we saw right
[1:13:11] up the top again. And sometimes it helps
[1:13:15] us to understand that why are we so up
[1:13:17] and down? Do you know what I mean?
[1:13:19] Sometimes we struggle with ourselves.
[1:13:20] Why are we so happy and then so down and
[1:13:22] so h? It's because we're just kind of
[1:13:24] under this anointing that the smallest
[1:13:26] little thing will lift us higher. Do you
[1:13:28] know what I mean? It'll lift us higher
[1:13:29] and we we'll start flying super high and
[1:13:31] then we're down to actually normal level
[1:13:33] which we feel is super down but it's
[1:13:34] not. We are not normal people. We're the
[1:13:37] Lord bride of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:39] We're just living in this body. Amen.
[1:13:42] Okay. And there's a constant tug of war
[1:13:44] obviously between your spiritual side
[1:13:45] which is real you and the flesh of you.
[1:13:49] Okay. Let's try and turn a corner now.
[1:13:50] Let's just read the last part of this
[1:13:52] quote
[1:13:53] here. It's the rising of the
[1:13:56] sun. Uh brother B says
[1:14:00] here and God knows hallelujah. He's got
[1:14:02] predestinated four ordained church. He
[1:14:05] knowed he's got sons and daughters and a
[1:14:07] bride waiting somewhere. And when the
[1:14:09] Holy Spirit begins to fly over it, that
[1:14:11] wave sheath, oh my, he's the same
[1:14:13] yesterday, today, and forever. Not some
[1:14:15] mythical story, but a reality. No matter
[1:14:17] how many tried to tell him an eagle, he
[1:14:19] didn't know what an eagle was. Yet, he
[1:14:22] was an eagle. He would not understand it
[1:14:25] until he seen something that reflected
[1:14:27] him, that he reflected rather. So,
[1:14:30] notice this little fella didn't know
[1:14:32] what it meant to be an eagle. But he was
[1:14:35] one, but he didn't know what it meant
[1:14:38] until he saw something that he
[1:14:41] reflected. And he didn't see, we didn't
[1:14:43] know that we were a part of God. And we
[1:14:45] didn't know that we were sons and
[1:14:46] daughters of God until we saw something.
[1:14:49] We saw something that reflected from the
[1:14:51] inside of us out. Something inside us,
[1:14:52] the life inside us that was laying in
[1:14:55] there. When we heard the message,
[1:14:56] something responded.
[1:14:58] Something way down inside. You know,
[1:15:01] amnesia. just the smallest little
[1:15:03] something, a little glimpse of something
[1:15:06] and it triggers a memory and sometimes
[1:15:08] that's how it is and the amnesia starts
[1:15:10] to lift from off of us. You know,
[1:15:12] brother talks about the soldier. He
[1:15:14] talks about the soldier. I'm not going
[1:15:15] to read. I'll just paraphrase it. So So
[1:15:17] brother talks about the soldier and he's
[1:15:19] he's shell shocked. He comes back. He's
[1:15:21] on the train and the soldiers let him
[1:15:23] out for a little stretch of the legs or
[1:15:24] whatever. And the guy sits there and he
[1:15:26] looks at the he starts looking around
[1:15:28] and he starts scratching his face and
[1:15:29] watching and he sees the water tower and
[1:15:32] he's like looking at the water tower and
[1:15:33] then he he starts walking and and the
[1:15:35] soldiers they kind of watch him from a
[1:15:37] distance and let him go and and he he
[1:15:39] follows a path around and he goes around
[1:15:40] this path and brother tells a story goes
[1:15:42] around the back and over the back of a
[1:15:43] hill or something and there is a house
[1:15:46] and there is his father who's waiting
[1:15:48] for him and the father says I always
[1:15:51] knew you'd come back to me and so on and
[1:15:54] so forth. So for this soldier that was
[1:15:56] lost, the memory that was triggered, it
[1:15:58] was a water
[1:16:00] tower. And when we hear the word of God
[1:16:03] preached, we can't explain it. Just like
[1:16:06] the soldier, he at that point in time,
[1:16:08] he would not have been able to explain
[1:16:09] it. See, the soldier at this point in
[1:16:12] time when he sees the water tower, don't
[1:16:14] forget when we first heard the message,
[1:16:17] something said, "Yeah, that that's it."
[1:16:19] Yeah. But we still didn't know who we
[1:16:22] were. Yeah, we didn't know our identity.
[1:16:26] This soldier boy, he's there. He sees
[1:16:28] the water tower. Something inside him is
[1:16:30] tugging on his heart, but he still
[1:16:32] doesn't know his identity. He walks
[1:16:35] around the path with every footstep he's
[1:16:38] taking. The amnesia is fading, but he
[1:16:42] still doesn't know his identity. He
[1:16:43] comes face to face with his father.
[1:16:47] He still doesn't know his identity. It
[1:16:50] takes the father to identify the son.
[1:16:53] See, we don't always just like, okay, I
[1:16:56] heard the message and boom, that was it.
[1:16:59] Really? Nice testimony. Next story. No,
[1:17:02] no, no. We heard the message. Something
[1:17:04] inside us is like, mate, there's
[1:17:06] something there.
[1:17:09] But it was just something there. And we
[1:17:12] go further. We go further until
[1:17:14] eventually we get there. We see through
[1:17:16] a glass darkly. Then face to face,
[1:17:18] suddenly we're seeing, "Mama, that's
[1:17:21] me." See what I mean? We're going up
[1:17:22] these steps of life
[1:17:24] and by faith we walk. We hear something
[1:17:28] familiar. It wasn't a water tower. It
[1:17:29] was maybe something else. But we hear
[1:17:31] something familiar and by faith we just
[1:17:33] keep walking down this little path. We
[1:17:36] don't know where it's going to end. Did
[1:17:37] anybody in here know that they would end
[1:17:40] up sitting in this chair when they were
[1:17:42] like 12? Anybody? Any hands?
[1:17:45] No. No. See, so but you're walking by
[1:17:48] faith. But you end where you end up is
[1:17:51] in front of the father and it's the
[1:17:53] voice behind the voice
[1:17:57] that's actually calling out to you and
[1:18:00] identifying you. The the scream from the
[1:18:03] eagle was the identification of who he
[1:18:07] was going to be when he reached
[1:18:09] maturity.
[1:18:11] Amen. And the soldier saw the water tank
[1:18:14] and he just kept on walking. He didn't
[1:18:16] know his identity. just kept going. You
[1:18:18] know, it takes the heavenly father
[1:18:21] that's waiting for us to give us our
[1:18:23] identity, to show us. And then you'll
[1:18:26] find yourself then when you hear the
[1:18:27] scream, when he stands face to face and
[1:18:29] he's
[1:18:30] saying, "Oh, brother Mike, he's standing
[1:18:33] there and brother Mike sees face to
[1:18:35] face." Huh? And now when he looks after
[1:18:40] all these years, he looks into the
[1:18:42] father's face and listen carefully. The
[1:18:46] resemblance that he
[1:18:48] sees is so close. Yes, it can only be a
[1:18:52] father and son. It can only be the
[1:18:55] resemblance is too close. It can only
[1:18:58] be. You've got, you know, you've got the
[1:19:01] um the Pittsenbar family. The the the
[1:19:04] resemblance is too close. the child and
[1:19:06] David. It's too close. It has to be a
[1:19:09] father and son. It's got to be. And this
[1:19:11] is when you come that close to this
[1:19:13] relationship. The father, he is standing
[1:19:15] face to face. He says, "You're my son."
[1:19:18] He's telling you your identity. Our
[1:19:21] identity is found in the resemblance
[1:19:24] between you and the father. The bride,
[1:19:27] she becomes this reflection of him.
[1:19:31] Amen. And we are molded and made into
[1:19:34] his very image. Now listen, we started
[1:19:36] out at the water trough. That's where we
[1:19:40] started. The soldier boys started out at
[1:19:42] the water at the water tower. I said
[1:19:44] water trough. The water tower. We
[1:19:46] started out at the water tower, but we
[1:19:48] still didn't know who we were. That's
[1:19:49] where we started out. But something we
[1:19:52] knew we were on the right path. We
[1:19:54] didn't know where it was going to end.
[1:19:55] If you'd have asked a soldier, well,
[1:19:56] where's the path going to go? He
[1:19:57] wouldn't know. All he knows is just one
[1:19:59] foot in front of the other. We don't
[1:20:01] know where it's going to end. We just
[1:20:03] got to keep walking. Amen. We don't know
[1:20:04] if the Lord comes this year or next
[1:20:06] year. We don't know. We just walk by
[1:20:07] faith. We just keep walking. Just keep
[1:20:10] walking. You know, we started out in the
[1:20:13] farmyard. Water trough. The water
[1:20:15] trough. I said it again. Farm boy.
[1:20:17] Sorry. We don't have water towels. We
[1:20:18] got water troughs. Water. Water tower.
[1:20:20] You start out the water tower. You start
[1:20:21] out in the farmyard. Wherever you are,
[1:20:23] you start out and you just keep going.
[1:20:25] But listen, our we don't know where it
[1:20:27] ends, but our end is predestinated. Our
[1:20:29] end is predestinated. Let's go back to
[1:20:32] our first scripture. It's Ephesians 1.
[1:20:34] I'm going to read 3-5
[1:20:36] again. Ephesians
[1:20:39] 1:3-5. Amen.
[1:20:41] It says, "Blessed be the God and father
[1:20:44] of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will bless
[1:20:45] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:20:47] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[1:20:49] he hath chosen us in him before the
[1:20:51] foundation of the world, that we should
[1:20:53] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:20:55] love, having predestinated unto the
[1:20:58] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:21:01] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:21:02] of his will." So now on this picture
[1:21:04] here, here we can write a number four
[1:21:08] and a number five. Yeah, this can be a
[1:21:10] number five. Oh, it's
[1:21:13] spread.
[1:21:15] Oh, that's it. So, here we can write a
[1:21:18] number five. And here we can write
[1:21:20] number four. That's verse four. And
[1:21:22] that's verse five. Verse four tells us
[1:21:24] where we've come from. Right before the
[1:21:26] foundation of the world. And verse five
[1:21:28] tells us where we're going. We are
[1:21:30] predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:21:32] children. So that's where we're when you
[1:21:34] say that's where we're going, the
[1:21:35] adoption of children. We're
[1:21:36] predestinated. We can
[1:21:38] see our future. Hallelujah.
[1:21:42] Okay. Where were
[1:21:43] we? There we go. So, when we're
[1:21:47] predestinated, predestinated, I like to
[1:21:49] say
[1:21:50] predestinationed because our destination
[1:21:52] is preset. It just makes it easier to
[1:21:55] understand almost. But pre, you know,
[1:21:56] it's like your satnav. It's like it's
[1:21:58] like when you buy one of those satnavs
[1:21:59] and it's secondhand and someone's
[1:22:03] already gone to New York and you're
[1:22:05] trying to type in but I want to go to
[1:22:06] Cincinnati and it won't let you because
[1:22:08] it's preset. See that's a bit like our
[1:22:10] life. You in your life you might have
[1:22:12] tried to go one way or the other. You
[1:22:14] might have tried to oh BCF no I prefer
[1:22:19] and and the Lord keeps bringing you back
[1:22:20] or oh you know and the Lord brings you
[1:22:22] back. The Lord's it's preset and it's
[1:22:24] kind of our GPS is kind of a bit
[1:22:27] broken. You know, it's one destination's
[1:22:30] entered in there and that's it. So,
[1:22:33] we're predestinated. We can't change
[1:22:36] where we're going. It's done. And for
[1:22:38] us, that's beautiful.
[1:22:41] You know, we are predestinated unto
[1:22:43] adoption. Now, adoption is not speaking,
[1:22:46] we've been over this many times, it's
[1:22:48] not speaking of somebody adopting a
[1:22:50] child, somebody else's child. It's not.
[1:22:53] It's speaking of a son reaching
[1:22:56] maturity.
[1:22:58] And when the sun reaches maturity, I'm
[1:23:00] going to have to blow my nose. I'm so
[1:23:01] sorry. Brother Franco, can you turn
[1:23:05] the
[1:23:09] eight? That was good. Awesome. Yeah,
[1:23:14] that was
[1:23:15] brilliant
[1:23:18] learning. Listen, adoption is when the
[1:23:22] son is mature enough that he reflects
[1:23:25] the father in such a way that when you
[1:23:29] look at the son, you're seeing the
[1:23:31] father.
[1:23:32] You see the father then when the son
[1:23:35] reaches his adoption the f he's the son
[1:23:38] is in such a
[1:23:40] position of maturity that the father can
[1:23:44] take his own ring and put it on his
[1:23:46] hand. Yeah. And whatever the son does
[1:23:50] it's done in the father's name.
[1:23:54] And when a son reaches the level of
[1:23:57] adoption and there is a level of
[1:24:00] adoption. There is a level of
[1:24:03] adoption. So this is the level of
[1:24:06] adoption. This is 100 just for numbers.
[1:24:08] This is 50. This is
[1:24:11] zero. This is the level of adoption. So
[1:24:14] when a
[1:24:16] son is going to grow up into that level
[1:24:20] of adoption, when he finally gets
[1:24:24] there, it's the father
[1:24:26] speaking. This is where we want to get
[1:24:28] to this speak. When the son reaches
[1:24:32] maturity, when the son reaches maturity,
[1:24:35] he's so in tune. He's so in tune with
[1:24:40] his father that he knows what his father
[1:24:43] wants done. He's so in tune that before
[1:24:48] the father even
[1:24:50] speaks, he says it. And it's exactly
[1:24:52] what the father wants to say.
[1:24:55] And when the bride reaches this level of
[1:24:57] maturity, and notice she's predestinated
[1:25:00] to reach this level. There is no way
[1:25:02] around it. The satnav is is put in.
[1:25:05] There's no way around it. She's
[1:25:06] predestinated to get to this level. When
[1:25:09] she reaches this level, when she reaches
[1:25:11] this level, all the amnesia is
[1:25:14] gone. All there's nothing more to cloud
[1:25:17] her judgment. You could say she's so in
[1:25:19] tune with the uh bridegroom that the
[1:25:22] wireless connection that was lost there
[1:25:24] in the Garden of Eden is now being
[1:25:27] restored. Now the bride's back online.
[1:25:29] You know, I mean, she there's that
[1:25:31] connection. She knows. She knows. She's
[1:25:33] just speaking it. She knows what he
[1:25:35] wants done to be said. Um, Matthew 10.
[1:25:38] Let's go to Matthew
[1:25:39] 10. Matthew
[1:25:42] 10:17-20. Matthew 10. Matthew
[1:25:47] 10:17-20. It says, "Beware of men, for
[1:25:50] they will deliver you up to councils,
[1:25:51] and they will scourge you in their
[1:25:53] synagogues. Ye should be brought before
[1:25:55] governors and kings for my sake, for a
[1:25:57] testimony against them under the
[1:25:58] Gentiles." Verse 19. But when they
[1:26:01] deliver you up, take no thought how or
[1:26:04] what you shall speak, for it shall be
[1:26:05] given you in that same hour what you
[1:26:07] shall speak. For it is not ye that
[1:26:09] speak, but the spirit of your father
[1:26:11] which speaketh in you. Amen. So here's
[1:26:14] the key. The bride gets to such a point
[1:26:17] where she is so filled with his spirit.
[1:26:20] Yeah. That when she speaks, all that
[1:26:23] comes out is him. She's so filled with
[1:26:26] the with the spirit. Don't forget the
[1:26:27] spirit is the life of God. It's the
[1:26:28] intelligence of God. It's not just like
[1:26:30] being filled with something else. It's
[1:26:32] the life. It's the intelligence of God.
[1:26:34] Whenever she opens her mouth, it just
[1:26:36] comes out what he wants to say. You
[1:26:38] know, as an example, it's like you get a
[1:26:40] big old bucket. I'm going to say a big
[1:26:42] bucket like this. And you fill it to the
[1:26:44] top with lemonade. Yeah. And you drill a
[1:26:47] little hole in the bottom. Now, you put
[1:26:49] your finger over
[1:26:50] there. What? Whichever way that you
[1:26:54] move, something's going to come out. And
[1:26:57] whatever's going to come out, everyone's
[1:26:59] going to get covered. You know what I
[1:27:00] mean? And whatever's comes out is what's
[1:27:03] in there. And the reason I say a big old
[1:27:05] bucket is because there's plenty of it
[1:27:07] in there. And there's plenty of his
[1:27:09] spirit in us. So that whatever uh little
[1:27:12] finger, whatever you move the finger on,
[1:27:15] it's going to come out what's in there.
[1:27:16] And whatever which way, the reason I say
[1:27:18] big bucket, I've done it myself. You
[1:27:20] just move wiggle your finger a little
[1:27:21] bit and it starts leaking out. You can,
[1:27:23] you know, it you can't help it. It just
[1:27:25] comes out. And that's kind of where we
[1:27:28] are. It's the thoughts of God. It's the
[1:27:30] life of God that every time you open
[1:27:32] your mouth, it just it just comes out.
[1:27:35] Every time you pull your finger away,
[1:27:36] the lemonade just comes out. Every time
[1:27:38] you you can't listen, you can't take
[1:27:40] your finger away from the hole and
[1:27:41] nothing comes out. You can't open your
[1:27:44] mouth without the life of God being shed
[1:27:46] abroad, you know. Amen. That's that's
[1:27:50] all there is to it. The Lord's
[1:27:52] got when we get to the point of
[1:27:55] adoption, the Lord puts the ring on our
[1:27:58] finger. It's permanent.
[1:28:01] Listen, have you ever seen a
[1:28:03] marriage where they come to the front,
[1:28:06] put the ring on the finger, 5 minutes
[1:28:08] later say, "Ah, nah, take it off." No,
[1:28:12] you can't. When the ring's on the
[1:28:14] finger, you can't take it back again. Do
[1:28:16] you mean when the ring when the ring's
[1:28:17] put on the finger and and and adoption
[1:28:20] when the father gives the son the ring
[1:28:22] and he says you've done it now that's it
[1:28:25] you're at that level you're mature
[1:28:26] enough whatever you say is what I say 5
[1:28:30] minutes later he can't take it away from
[1:28:31] us do you know what I mean he can't take
[1:28:33] it away from us so this is a permanent
[1:28:35] thing the adoption is a permanent thing
[1:28:38] you know the picture of what he had of
[1:28:41] you before the foundation of the world
[1:28:43] is complete and this is that level of
[1:28:46] adoption that we're getting to. It's
[1:28:47] where whatever he look, the Lord's
[1:28:50] wanting us to get to this point where
[1:28:52] he's just telling us just speak. He's
[1:28:54] wanting us to get to the point where we
[1:28:57] are so filled with him, so mature, so in
[1:29:00] tune, so in line with what he with his
[1:29:04] spirit that everything we say and do is
[1:29:06] just him. That's what he's wanting us to
[1:29:08] get to. He's wanting to live through
[1:29:10] this God in partnership with man. is
[1:29:11] wanting to manifest himself through a
[1:29:13] people, through a bride, and it's time
[1:29:16] for us to speak.
[1:29:19] Michelangelo and the statue of Moses.
[1:29:23] You know, the statue was
[1:29:26] born in a granite rock pile somewhere.
[1:29:30] Just an old farmyard, maybe back of a
[1:29:32] farmyard. It was just born
[1:29:35] there before he started working
[1:29:38] it. The granite piece had no idea what
[1:29:42] it was. No idea what it was. But when it
[1:29:46] was finished, when it had gone through
[1:29:47] the whole process, the making, the
[1:29:49] molding, the shaping, the polishing,
[1:29:51] when it had gone through the whole
[1:29:53] process, it was so perfect. It was so in
[1:29:56] the image of how he'd seen it before the
[1:29:59] foundation of the mucky behind the rock
[1:30:02] that was in the You know what I'm
[1:30:03] saying?
[1:30:04] It was so in the image that he struck it
[1:30:08] and he said speak.
[1:30:10] Let's read this. Brother says God's
[1:30:13] provided a place of worship. Speaking
[1:30:14] about this, I stood on yonder in Los
[1:30:16] Angeles forest garden one day. My heart
[1:30:18] jumped. How many's ever been in forest
[1:30:19] lawn? There's a statue of Moses by
[1:30:23] Michelangelo. It's perfect statue all
[1:30:25] but on the right knee. There's a nick
[1:30:27] about half an inch deep. And the guide I
[1:30:30] was looking at pointed out to me. He
[1:30:31] said, "Michelader spent a lifetime
[1:30:32] trying to make he was a sculpture who
[1:30:35] was trying to make the image of Moses
[1:30:36] back in his mind. He had in mind what
[1:30:38] Moses should look like. He had it in his
[1:30:41] heart what Moses should look like. He
[1:30:43] had spent a lifetime a chisel here and
[1:30:46] rub there, stand back, look at it. Year
[1:30:48] after year, how many years has he been
[1:30:50] working on us?
[1:30:52] Year after year, he worked on it.
[1:30:53] Finally, when it was completed, he
[1:30:55] stepped back, laid the down his rag and
[1:30:57] his hammer. He looked at the statue. It
[1:30:59] was so perfect. the image of Moses that
[1:31:02] he had in his heart till he got so
[1:31:04] beside himself that he grabbed the
[1:31:06] hammer and struck it and hollered speak.
[1:31:08] It's called Michelangelo's masterpiece.
[1:31:11] That great something in that sculpture,
[1:31:13] that vision that he had of what Moses
[1:31:16] ought to be with was only portraying in
[1:31:19] type of the great father God.
[1:31:22] Amen. The Lord's good. See, the statue
[1:31:25] didn't just appear. The statue took many
[1:31:28] years of his life. You know, year after
[1:31:31] year, the process seeking out the rock,
[1:31:35] you know, Alabama, wherever it was,
[1:31:38] wherever that the statue
[1:31:40] was, seeking it out. And where was it?
[1:31:43] Rocky Top. We said, whatever it is,
[1:31:45] seeking out the the the thing that had
[1:31:49] no idea what it was going to be. The
[1:31:52] statue, the rock, had no idea what it
[1:31:54] was going to be. Brother Bob back there,
[1:31:56] he had no idea what he was going to be.
[1:31:59] No idea until the Lord started working
[1:32:02] and working and working. But you see,
[1:32:05] whenever the process was all finished
[1:32:07] and done, it was so perfect that the
[1:32:10] creator gets to the point where what he
[1:32:12] sees in front of him is what was in his
[1:32:15] heart and he hits it and he says,
[1:32:17] "Speak." It's so real that he says,
[1:32:20] "Christ, speak." And you see when we
[1:32:23] when we see ourselves in this story all
[1:32:25] the years that we've been going through
[1:32:27] until we reach this predestinated point
[1:32:30] when we get to this point of adoption
[1:32:32] when we get to this remember this point
[1:32:33] of adoption is
[1:32:35] predestinated. It says we're
[1:32:36] predestinated unto adoption. We there's
[1:32:39] no way around it. We we we're going to
[1:32:41] reach this level. Each one of us will
[1:32:43] reach this level. And see when this when
[1:32:45] we get when we reach this level of
[1:32:47] adoption and notice it's only when the
[1:32:50] statue is finished when the statue is
[1:32:54] finished when the creator of the statue
[1:32:56] actually sees in front of him what was
[1:32:59] in his mind so perfectly so perfectly
[1:33:03] exactly what he saw before he started.
[1:33:06] Then he strikes and he shouts speak. And
[1:33:09] you know, the Lord is getting us slowly
[1:33:10] to this place where he's wanting us to
[1:33:13] speak. You know, we're getting to the
[1:33:15] place where where we are matching the
[1:33:17] picture of what he had of us before the
[1:33:20] foundation of the world. And you know,
[1:33:22] even if you think of Queen Esther, Queen
[1:33:25] Esther pleased the king, she was so in
[1:33:28] tune with with with how he thought. She
[1:33:31] was so in tune with him that that when
[1:33:34] she came to him, she knew what garments
[1:33:36] she had to wear. She knew how to conduct
[1:33:38] herself. She and and it was when you
[1:33:41] know when she was dressed in the
[1:33:43] garments that he gave her. And so you
[1:33:46] could almost say that she was clothed in
[1:33:49] his righteousness. You know, it wasn't
[1:33:51] her own. She didn't go and buy those. It
[1:33:54] was his clothes. So she was clothed in
[1:33:56] his clothes of righteousness. And you
[1:33:58] know, she was so pleased him. And when
[1:34:01] she did, he said,
[1:34:03] "Speak. Whatever it is, speak. But don't
[1:34:07] forget, whatever we speak is going to be
[1:34:10] in line with what he wants us to say
[1:34:12] because we're so in tune. Let's just
[1:34:15] read Eleazar and Rebecca, Brother
[1:34:23] Franco. Thank
[1:34:25] you. Thank you. Uh Genesis 24 if we can.
[1:34:30] Genesis
[1:34:31] 24. I just want to see a few little a
[1:34:34] few little a few
[1:34:36] little examples here if we can. 24
[1:34:40] Genesis 24 and we'll read
[1:34:43] 12-9. 12-1 19. So Eleazar's gone. He's
[1:34:48] outside the city wall now next to the
[1:34:50] well and he's praying to the
[1:34:52] Lord. He says, "Oh Lord, God of my
[1:34:55] master Abraham, I pray thee, send me
[1:34:56] good speed this day. Show kindness unto
[1:34:59] my master Abraham. Behold, I stand here
[1:35:01] by the well of water, and the daughters
[1:35:03] of men of the city come out and draw
[1:35:04] water. Verse 14. And let it come to pass
[1:35:07] that the damsel to whom I shall say, let
[1:35:08] down thy picture, I pray thee, that I
[1:35:10] may drink, and she shall say, drink, and
[1:35:13] I will give thy camels drink also, that
[1:35:15] the same be she, that thou hast appoint
[1:35:17] thy servant Isaac, and thereby I shall
[1:35:19] know that thou hast shown kindness unto
[1:35:21] my master. And it came to pass before he
[1:35:23] had done speaking that behold Rebecca
[1:35:25] came out who was born of Bethul son of
[1:35:28] Maha the wife of Nahor Abraham's brother
[1:35:31] and with her picture on her shoulder and
[1:35:33] the dams was very fair to look upon a
[1:35:35] virgin neither had any man known her.
[1:35:37] And she went down to with well and
[1:35:38] filled her picture and came up and the
[1:35:40] servant ran to meet her and said let me
[1:35:42] I pray thee drink a little water of thy
[1:35:44] picture and she said drink my lord and
[1:35:46] she hastened and let down her picture
[1:35:49] upon her hand and gave him drink. And
[1:35:51] when she had done giving him drink, she
[1:35:52] said, "I will draw water for like camels
[1:35:54] also until they have done drinking."
[1:35:57] Amen. So notice here, this is quite
[1:35:59] beautiful
[1:36:01] because she finishes the sentence. This
[1:36:04] is very nice. I like this. She finishes
[1:36:06] the sentence and by her finishing he
[1:36:09] only says half and he lets her say the
[1:36:11] other half. But but what is this?
[1:36:14] Basically, it's speak. She is speaking
[1:36:17] what is actually in the heart of Eliza.
[1:36:21] She is actually speaking the unspoken
[1:36:23] part which he wanted to say. He wanted
[1:36:26] it that way which was actually him being
[1:36:28] led of the Lord. So it's what the Lord
[1:36:31] it's the mind of God and she finishes a
[1:36:34] sentence speak. She is finishing the
[1:36:37] sentence. You know the children of God
[1:36:39] being so in tune with God that the God
[1:36:42] is speaking through them. Let's just
[1:36:44] have one more example. And I like this
[1:36:45] little example. It's verse uh Acts
[1:36:47] chapter 9. Acts chapter 9 if we can.
[1:36:51] Acts chapter
[1:36:56] 9. Acts chapter 9. And we're going to
[1:36:59] read 9 to 18. 9 to8. So now this is
[1:37:04] Paul. Saul. Paul. Paul who's been
[1:37:07] blinded. Struck off the horse as it were
[1:37:10] off the horse. struck down to the floor.
[1:37:12] And
[1:37:13] um yeah, it says here, we're going to
[1:37:16] read from verse 9. It says, "And he was
[1:37:19] three days without sight. Neither did he
[1:37:21] eat nor drink. He's gone into Damascus."
[1:37:23] Now, Paul's going to Damascus. Verse 10,
[1:37:25] "And there was a certain disciple at
[1:37:26] Damascus named Ananas." See, this is the
[1:37:28] body of the Lord. The Lord uses the body
[1:37:31] of the Lord. So, Ananas uh named Ananas.
[1:37:34] And to him, said the Lord in a vision,
[1:37:36] Ananas, and he said, "Behold, here I am,
[1:37:38] Lord." And the Lord said unto him,
[1:37:40] "Arise and go into the street which is
[1:37:41] called straight, and inquire at the
[1:37:43] house of Judas, for one called Paul Saul
[1:37:45] of Tarsus. And behold, he prayth, and
[1:37:48] I've seen in a vision a man named Ananas
[1:37:50] coming in, and putting his hand on him,
[1:37:52] that he might receive
[1:37:54] sight." Then Ananas answered, "Lord,
[1:37:57] I've heard by many of this man, how much
[1:37:59] evil you hath done to thy saints at
[1:38:01] Jerusalem, and here he hath authority
[1:38:03] from the chief priest to bind all that
[1:38:04] call on thy name." But the Lord said
[1:38:07] unto him, "Go thy way, for he is a
[1:38:08] chosen vessel unto me to bear my name
[1:38:10] before the kings, Gentiles and kings,
[1:38:12] and the children of Israel, for I will
[1:38:14] show him how great things he must suffer
[1:38:16] for my name's sake." And Ananas went his
[1:38:18] way, entered into the house, putting on
[1:38:20] hands, putting hands on him, said,
[1:38:22] "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus,
[1:38:24] that appeared unto thee in the way, as
[1:38:25] thou camest, he hath sent me, and thou
[1:38:28] might that thou mightest receive thy
[1:38:30] sight, and be filled with the Holy
[1:38:31] Ghost." And immediately they fell off
[1:38:34] his eyes as it had been scales and he
[1:38:36] rei received sight forth with and arose
[1:38:38] and was baptized. Now maybe you've seen
[1:38:40] this in here, maybe you haven't. Check
[1:38:42] this out. In verse 12, Ananas sees a
[1:38:47] vision from the Lord. Okay. Says in
[1:38:50] verse 12, "And he hath seen in a vision
[1:38:54] a man a man named Ananas coming in
[1:38:57] putting his hand on him that he might
[1:38:59] receive sight." Notice that he might
[1:39:02] receive sight. Full stop. Yeah.
[1:39:06] When Ananas prays for him. Ananas
[1:39:10] finishes the
[1:39:11] sentence. Verse 17. If we read the end
[1:39:14] of verse 17, he says, "Brother Saul,
[1:39:16] halfway through, the Lord, even Jesus
[1:39:18] that appeared unto thee in the way as
[1:39:20] thou camest, he hath sent me that thou
[1:39:23] mightest receive thy sight." Now, that's
[1:39:25] all that Ananas saw in the vision. Yeah,
[1:39:28] but he finishes a sentence and he says,
[1:39:30] "And be filled with the Holy Ghost." He
[1:39:32] never said nothing about that.
[1:39:35] So Ananas is actually here. He's
[1:39:37] finishing. It's the same thing again.
[1:39:38] He's speaking something that's actually
[1:39:41] from the heart of the Lord and
[1:39:43] immediately this from his eyes received
[1:39:45] scales and he received sight forth and
[1:39:47] he rose and was baptized. So immediat
[1:39:50] see what I mean. So in one, so this is a
[1:39:52] nice example again of where the Lord is
[1:39:54] just using somebody using the bride to
[1:39:57] speak to say something. How many times
[1:39:59] has the Lord use you to speak to another
[1:40:01] brother? How many just cuz you stand
[1:40:03] here doesn't how many times has the
[1:40:04] minister been encouraged. You go to
[1:40:06] someone's house and they'll say
[1:40:07] something and it's direct from the heart
[1:40:09] of the Lord to you just what you needed.
[1:40:11] Yeah. Yeah. But I thought I was the one
[1:40:12] I'd say it all. No, no, no. You don't
[1:40:15] even realize half the time what you guys
[1:40:16] say. You see, the Lord is using you to
[1:40:20] speak. He's using you. Amen. The Lord's
[1:40:23] good. The Lord's calling us to adoption.
[1:40:25] He's calling us to to to that level
[1:40:28] where he can just speak. It's our turn.
[1:40:30] We've got to speak to Brother M says, I
[1:40:32] I like this. This is in the church age
[1:40:34] book, Leian Church. He says, and we know
[1:40:36] we've read this a thousand times. He
[1:40:38] says, "In the dark ages, the word almost
[1:40:39] was entirely lost to the people." Notice
[1:40:41] here it says when you read it, it says
[1:40:44] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:40:47] entirely lost to the people. The word
[1:40:49] wasn't lost. It was lost to the people.
[1:40:52] Yeah. The word wasn't lost. The word was
[1:40:54] never lost. Okay. So, the word was
[1:40:56] almost entirely lost to the people. But
[1:40:58] God sent Luther with the word. The
[1:41:00] Lutheran spoke for God at that time.
[1:41:04] What is it? Speak. See, during the time
[1:41:06] of of Luther, that's the um that's this
[1:41:08] one here. The uh that's this little one
[1:41:11] here. The red one. Oh.
[1:41:15] Oh, the red one. They were saying, "No,
[1:41:18] no, no. It's it's a tall block of houses
[1:41:20] just to live by faith. It's this. It's
[1:41:21] that." And actually, that was the Lord
[1:41:24] speaking through his people. The Lord
[1:41:26] was speaking through his people there.
[1:41:28] The Lutheran spoke for God at that time.
[1:41:30] But they organized. And again, the pure
[1:41:32] word was lost. For organization tends
[1:41:34] towards dogmas and creeds and not simple
[1:41:37] word. They could no longer speak for
[1:41:39] God. Then God sank Wesley and he was the
[1:41:42] voice of the word in his day. The people
[1:41:44] who took his revelation from God became
[1:41:47] the living epistles read and known of
[1:41:49] all men for their generation. A living
[1:41:51] epistle an epistle is a letter from God.
[1:41:54] An epistle is a written is a written
[1:41:55] record. A written record and this is the
[1:41:58] pardon me the word of God. So the people
[1:42:00] who took the revelation from God became
[1:42:03] the living epistles read and known of
[1:42:05] all men. So whoever was reading the men
[1:42:07] were basically reading the message. They
[1:42:09] became the word for that day. So when
[1:42:11] the Methodists failed, God raised up
[1:42:12] others. And so it has gone on through
[1:42:13] the years until this last day. There is
[1:42:15] again another people in the land who
[1:42:17] under their messenger will be the final
[1:42:19] voice to the final age. And of course
[1:42:21] that I'm drawing all over here. I don't
[1:42:23] know what I'm doing. That's it. That's
[1:42:25] this eagle anointing. That's this top
[1:42:27] one. This is Oh yeah. Sorry, brother.
[1:42:30] I'm making a bit of a mess. I want to go
[1:42:31] back to this one because I'm going to be
[1:42:32] here in a minute. All good.
[1:42:36] Okay, sweet. So, amen. So, the Lord is
[1:42:40] wanting us. The bride is the final
[1:42:42] voice. Now, if we've got a voice, then a
[1:42:44] voice has to speak. If we haven't got a
[1:42:47] voice and we don't speak, then what's
[1:42:48] the point? And if the bride is the final
[1:42:50] voice, the final age, we also have to
[1:42:52] speak. We've also got to live this word.
[1:42:54] Our life is the word word for word in
[1:42:58] flesh form. And it's for all the world
[1:43:00] to see. We are this this this epistle to
[1:43:03] read of all men. Go to 2 Corinthians,
[1:43:05] please. 2 Corinthians, verse chapter 3.
[1:43:08] 2 Corinthians, chapter
[1:43:10] 3, and we're going to read 1:5. 2
[1:43:13] Corinthians 3 1:5. It says, "Do we begin
[1:43:16] to again to commend ourselves or need we
[1:43:18] as some others explain uh sorry exists
[1:43:21] of commendation to you or letters of
[1:43:24] commendation from you? Ye are our
[1:43:26] epistle written in our hearts, known and
[1:43:29] read of all men. For as much as ye are
[1:43:31] manifested declared to be the epistle of
[1:43:33] Christ, ministered by us, written not
[1:43:35] with ink, but with the spirit of the
[1:43:36] living God, not in tables of stone, but
[1:43:38] in the fleshy tables of the heart, in
[1:43:41] and such trust we have through Christ
[1:43:43] toward uh
[1:43:45] God. Not that we are sufficient of
[1:43:47] ourselves to think anything of
[1:43:48] ourselves, but our sufficiency is of
[1:43:50] God. Amen. Notice in verse three, the
[1:43:53] bride of that day. So Paul's writing
[1:43:55] here, the bride of our day, he says in
[1:43:57] verse three, for as much as ye are
[1:43:59] manifestly declared to be the epistle of
[1:44:02] Christ, listen carefully, ministered by
[1:44:05] us. Okay, so the church of that day was
[1:44:10] the an epistle. They had become the word
[1:44:13] and they had become the an epistle of
[1:44:17] the message for that day. That's right.
[1:44:19] Right. So now they become this walking
[1:44:23] talking word that everyone can see which
[1:44:28] was the exact message that Paul
[1:44:30] preached. And so the believers are like
[1:44:31] they they were basically living walking
[1:44:34] message books you could say and tapes of
[1:44:37] the message for that day.
[1:44:40] Um Luther Wesley same thing same thing
[1:44:43] which is basically what brother Ram's
[1:44:44] saying here in the church age book. It's
[1:44:46] the same thing in each age they become.
[1:44:48] In fact, brother says in the church
[1:44:49] change book, he says, he says, "Then God
[1:44:50] sent Wesley, there were a voice with the
[1:44:52] word in his day, the people who took his
[1:44:54] revelation for God became the living
[1:44:57] epistles read and known of all men for
[1:44:59] their generation."
[1:45:02] So we
[1:45:04] too, we too, we are walking, we are
[1:45:08] written epistles read of all men, not
[1:45:11] just of Wesley's message, but of this
[1:45:15] message, of the last days's message,
[1:45:17] which is why we become the final voice
[1:45:20] of the final age because we are that
[1:45:23] walking talking message books. You know,
[1:45:26] brother B says they will not read the
[1:45:28] Bible. It's not the message is not only
[1:45:31] in book form anymore. It's not only in
[1:45:33] tape form. It's not only on the
[1:45:34] computer. It's also living. It's a
[1:45:36] living message books. And we are
[1:45:39] that. But says here in 1962, it wasn't
[1:45:43] so from the beginning. He says now
[1:45:46] that's the way each one of us ministers
[1:45:47] do. We reflect God as God is in us. And
[1:45:50] then the only way that God can move is
[1:45:53] and people see God is through we his
[1:45:56] servants. That's how people won't read a
[1:46:00] Bible, but they'll read you. See, and so
[1:46:03] you reflect Christ. Your walks, your
[1:46:05] talks, your actions, all reflect Christ.
[1:46:08] You might not think it. People are
[1:46:10] watching you, but they're watching every
[1:46:12] move you make. You are a Bible to many
[1:46:15] people. Therefore, we've got to watch
[1:46:18] what we do, our business deals,
[1:46:19] everything we do, and our entire walk.
[1:46:21] Just yield ourselves to the spirit, and
[1:46:23] God will reflect himself through you. As
[1:46:25] I said, like a vine. Jesus said in John
[1:46:27] 15, "I'm the vine. You are the
[1:46:29] branches." Now remember, the vine does
[1:46:30] not bear fruit. It's the branch that
[1:46:31] bears fruit, but he gets life from the
[1:46:33] vine. Pardon me. Notice how people won't
[1:46:37] even read the Bible anymore, but they'll
[1:46:39] read you. You know, how many times how
[1:46:41] many times do does it would it annoy us
[1:46:45] if if you knew that somebody was um
[1:46:49] using the scriptures in a in a in a
[1:46:50] wrong way, misquing the scriptures,
[1:46:52] twisting them, turning them around to
[1:46:54] say something else? that we we wouldn't
[1:46:56] be happy. But don't forget our life's
[1:46:58] the same thing. We are the living
[1:47:00] walking. And if we live our life
[1:47:03] anything other than what the message for
[1:47:05] our day says, then we're actually giving
[1:47:08] a false representation of this. You know
[1:47:11] what I mean? It's quite it's a serious
[1:47:12] position. It's a serious position that
[1:47:14] we have. We are reflecting the word to
[1:47:18] the world. You
[1:47:21] know, the Lord's good. The amount of
[1:47:25] revelation we have should also be
[1:47:28] reflected because don't forget if they
[1:47:29] were the if they were the messenger if
[1:47:31] they were the written epistles for Paul
[1:47:33] in that day it was for the level of word
[1:47:35] and in each church age they were
[1:47:37] reflecting for the level of word if we
[1:47:40] what so now we're representing a closed
[1:47:43] book the book's open the mysteries are
[1:47:46] revealed and and we've been shown who we
[1:47:48] are we've been shown how we're to live
[1:47:50] and what we're to do if we reflect
[1:47:52] anything other than that we're misrepres
[1:47:54] presenting the word. You know, we've got
[1:47:56] to reflect. Remember, we're standing in
[1:47:58] front of that mirror and that reflection
[1:48:00] is him. So, that's what we've got to be
[1:48:03] showing to the world. Amen. Okay. So,
[1:48:05] the bride is the final voice. And if she
[1:48:07] is the final voice, then she's got to
[1:48:08] speak. And the Lord is telling us that
[1:48:11] we are that final voice. We have to
[1:48:13] speak. We've got no choice. We have to
[1:48:15] live. The Lord wants us to use our
[1:48:17] voice. He wants to use our voice to
[1:48:19] speak. He wants to use your life to
[1:48:21] manifest himself to the world to
[1:48:25] speak. You know, in closing, I like I
[1:48:29] like what brother Andrea said in Poland.
[1:48:32] He said, "Job's testing began at the
[1:48:36] level of
[1:48:38] perfection." Job's testing began at that
[1:48:41] level of adoption. That's true. When you
[1:48:44] read the book of Job, it's sat the
[1:48:46] Lord's challenging Satan say, "Yeah, but
[1:48:48] have you seen Job? He's perfect. He's
[1:48:50] perfect in every way. There's no one
[1:48:52] like him. See, Job had reached that
[1:48:54] level and then the testing begins. So,
[1:48:56] how many think I
[1:48:58] mean, listen, only when the statue was
[1:49:03] perfect.
[1:49:04] Yeah. Did the big old hammer come out.
[1:49:08] Yeah. Only when the statue was perfect
[1:49:11] did he grab a big old hammer and give it
[1:49:13] a smack. Yeah. And say, "Speak." Amen.
[1:49:16] See, Job's testing began when he was
[1:49:18] perfect in the eyes of the Lord. You
[1:49:20] know, sometimes we're up and a bit up
[1:49:23] and a bit down. And sometimes we wonder
[1:49:25] why we go through these trials and all
[1:49:28] the things that we go through. And as
[1:49:30] soon as we go through trials,
[1:49:31] immediately the first thing we think is,
[1:49:33] "Oh, I haven't prayed enough." You know,
[1:49:35] oh Lord, I haven't testified enough. I
[1:49:38] haven't I haven't done enough for the
[1:49:39] kingdom. You know, if we if we did
[1:49:42] everything that we could physically do
[1:49:43] for the kingdom, it would still not be
[1:49:45] enough. That's right. You know, but
[1:49:47] immediat as soon as
[1:49:49] something the enemy comes in, you know,
[1:49:52] oh Lord, what have I done? We're
[1:49:54] immediately looking at ourselves. We've
[1:49:55] always got this explanation for things.
[1:49:57] What's wrong with us? Lord, is it this?
[1:49:59] Is it that? What is it?
[1:50:02] But remember, we are the written
[1:50:04] epistles. We're read of all men. The
[1:50:06] Lord wants us to speak. The Lord wants
[1:50:08] us to just live. And sometimes we go
[1:50:10] through things in life tests so that
[1:50:14] actually the way that we react to a
[1:50:18] situation, someone's watching. It's like
[1:50:21] and the way that you react if it's just
[1:50:24] the Lord the Lord bang the nails in. He
[1:50:27] didn't he didn't complain. He didn't
[1:50:30] complain. He just let them do it. You
[1:50:33] know, and the way that he reacted had an
[1:50:37] effect on many people. That's right. The
[1:50:39] way that you react has an effect on more
[1:50:42] people than you think. Cuz if you work
[1:50:43] in a if you work in a business, people
[1:50:45] are watching you all the time. People
[1:50:47] are watching you and people are making
[1:50:49] comments to try and you know, they might
[1:50:52] tell some stupid
[1:50:53] joke. It's like that's so funny really.
[1:50:57] And they're like, you know what? You're
[1:50:59] not entering into their stupid joke. You
[1:51:02] know what I mean? It's just you're
[1:51:03] raising above it and they're looking at
[1:51:05] you and then they'll and then they'll
[1:51:06] they'll say something else and maybe
[1:51:07] next week they'll say something else.
[1:51:09] What are they doing? They're constantly
[1:51:10] seeing how you react and then you go to
[1:51:13] work and you're 2 minutes from work in
[1:51:15] your car engine explodes. That's it.
[1:51:18] She's done. She's toast. And you walk
[1:51:20] the rest of the work and you're late to
[1:51:22] work. What's
[1:51:23] wrong? Car blew up 2 milesi down the
[1:51:25] road. Would you believe it? What? Aren't
[1:51:28] you upset? Are you going to swear and
[1:51:30] get angry? No, it's okay. The Lord the
[1:51:33] Lord will help me. It's fine. It's okay.
[1:51:34] Don't worry about it. And the Lord like
[1:51:36] what? You see what I mean? That
[1:51:38] sometimes the Lord allows things to
[1:51:40] happen and it's not to punish you.
[1:51:43] Sometimes it's just for the guy next
[1:51:45] door that's watching you and it's like,
[1:51:48] mate, he's just dropped a huge piece of
[1:51:50] steel on his foot and it's bleeding and
[1:51:52] he's not he's not screaming at it. Do
[1:51:55] you know what I mean? See what I mean?
[1:51:56] Sometimes that too is a voice that's
[1:51:59] speaking. The reading, the way that we
[1:52:03] react. You know, the Lord, he's prepared
[1:52:06] us. The
[1:52:09] Lord the Lord prepared the Lord's
[1:52:11] predestinated us to the level of
[1:52:13] affection to to the level of perfection.
[1:52:15] And you know, there is a big
[1:52:18] difference. My final drawing of the day.
[1:52:21] There's a big difference
[1:52:24] between this is supposed to be
[1:52:27] Oh, pardon
[1:52:35] me. There's a big difference between
[1:52:38] this.
[1:52:40] Yeah. And this
[1:52:49] one. You know what I'm saying?
[1:52:52] There's a big difference between
[1:52:54] reaching adoption when the Lord has done
[1:52:57] it, carried you through every trial and
[1:52:59] a test. And there's a difference between
[1:53:01] hanging on saying, "Oh Lord, yeah,
[1:53:02] that's me. I'm ready. I'm ready." No,
[1:53:04] no, no. The Lord knows when we're ready.
[1:53:07] The Lord knows. We are predestining.
[1:53:09] We're in the Lord's hand. He's holding
[1:53:11] us. He's lifting us up to that level of
[1:53:13] perfection. We don't have to start
[1:53:14] jumping at it. We don't have to start
[1:53:16] hanging off it, trying to hang on with
[1:53:18] the little finger. Say, "Lord, but you
[1:53:20] said but you said." Just relax. Live the
[1:53:23] life. The Lord has predestinated us into
[1:53:25] that adoption. And we are now coming to
[1:53:29] that point where he's wanting us to
[1:53:31] speak. He's wanting us to speak. And the
[1:53:33] amnesia's left us. Don't forget that
[1:53:36] when you when we're reaching that point,
[1:53:37] the amnesia is clearly away. Now, on a
[1:53:41] bad day, do we ever think, "Oh, Lord,
[1:53:43] I'm totally lost and you don't love me
[1:53:44] anymore." No. No. On a bad day, when we
[1:53:46] have a bad day, do we do we think
[1:53:48] thoughts of, "Oh, well, maybe I wasn't
[1:53:49] in him before the foundation of the
[1:53:50] world." No. No, we don't. No. No.
[1:53:52] Because we're there. We know who we are.
[1:53:54] The amnesia has left us. You know, it's
[1:53:56] time for us to step up and speak. It's
[1:53:58] time for us to step up and Lord, what
[1:54:00] would you have me do today? How would
[1:54:01] you have me live today? You know, we're
[1:54:03] soaring up in the heavenlies. The Lord
[1:54:04] wants us to speak. And he wants us to
[1:54:06] speak what's on his heart. He wants us
[1:54:08] to finish the sentence. He wants us to
[1:54:10] say what he wants us to say. You know
[1:54:13] the Lord's prayer. When the Lord taught
[1:54:14] us to pray, there's pray there's no um
[1:54:18] space in there for our own ideas. You
[1:54:20] know that? Yeah. Yeah. I can read it to
[1:54:22] you. Actually, it's Matthew 6, isn't
[1:54:24] it? Yeah, it's Matthew
[1:54:27] 6. Matthew 6
[1:54:30] uh verse 10 verse 9. After this manner,
[1:54:33] therefore, pray ye says, "Our Father
[1:54:36] identification which are in heaven,
[1:54:38] hallowed be thy name." What's it
[1:54:40] starting with? It's starting with
[1:54:41] praise. This is how the Lord taught us
[1:54:42] to pray. He starts with praise. Doesn't
[1:54:44] start with, "Oh Lord, please do this.
[1:54:46] Please do that." No, it starts with
[1:54:47] praise. Verse 10, "Thy kingdom come. Thy
[1:54:51] will be done in earth as it is in
[1:54:53] heaven. Let your what we're doing, what
[1:54:56] we're saying, let that voice that's
[1:54:57] coming out of my lips now, let that be
[1:54:59] according to what is in heaven. Give us
[1:55:02] this day our daily bread." Yeah, but
[1:55:03] what about next week?
[1:55:06] No, no, never mind about next week. step
[1:55:08] by step walking around the mountain,
[1:55:10] water towers on the right hand side, day
[1:55:12] by day. Give us this day our daily
[1:55:14] bread. Forgive us our debts as we
[1:55:15] forgive our debtors. Lead us not into
[1:55:16] temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[1:55:18] For thine is the power, the kingdom, the
[1:55:20] power, and the glory forever. Amen.
[1:55:22] That's it. See, it's about his will.
[1:55:25] It's about heaven coming down. It's
[1:55:28] about the Lord living through a people.
[1:55:31] Don't premeditate what you're going to
[1:55:33] say. Don't premed, oh Lord, he wants me
[1:55:35] to speak. Don't go out there and start
[1:55:37] trying to speak. Don't. Because when
[1:55:38] it's the right time, the Lord will speak
[1:55:40] through you. But if we just stay in
[1:55:41] tune, then when that time comes, then
[1:55:43] we'll just speak what he wants us to
[1:55:45] say. You see, the Lord has used the
[1:55:47] prophets to speak. The Lord has used the
[1:55:49] apostles to speak. The Lord used the the
[1:55:51] reformers to speak. He's used the bride
[1:55:54] in every age to speak. He wants us to
[1:55:56] speak. He wants us to live. He wants to
[1:55:58] us to be the the the word manifested for
[1:56:02] this day so that the world can see
[1:56:05] actually listen the world needs to be
[1:56:08] able to see what brother preached.
[1:56:11] Yeah. The world needs to see because we
[1:56:13] are written epistles of the word for
[1:56:15] this day. So actually the world needs to
[1:56:17] be able to see our life and say well
[1:56:21] hang about that's real different to what
[1:56:22] I know Christianity. What's all that
[1:56:24] about? Will you see? And you can tell
[1:56:27] them, but it should be reflecting what
[1:56:29] actually what the message for this day
[1:56:30] is. Amen. Let's just stand up and let's
[1:56:32] just praise as brother Chad comes. Just
[1:56:35] want to thank the Lord. We want to thank
[1:56:36] you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we thank you for
[1:56:38] health and strength, Lord. Thank you for
[1:56:40] your word, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that
[1:56:43] the end is predestinated, Lord. Lord, we
[1:56:46] will reach that level adoption, Lord.
[1:56:48] You've got your hand under us. You're
[1:56:49] holding us carefully, Lord. You've
[1:56:51] lifted us up through all the trials,
[1:56:52] Lord. Though we're tested daily, Lord,
[1:56:56] we realize that only after the statue
[1:56:58] was perfect, Lord, did Moses did
[1:57:00] Michelangelo strike it. And Lord, your
[1:57:03] testing, Lord, starts with Job a
[1:57:06] perfection. We love you, Lord. We just
[1:57:08] thankful, Lord, for your hand upon us,
[1:57:09] Lord. Continue with us. We pray, lead
[1:57:12] us, guide us, direct us, use us, we
[1:57:14] pray. We just thank you, Lord. And pray
[1:57:16] a blessing on people here, Lord Jesus,
[1:57:18] and around the world. Speak to Lord,
[1:57:20] your people, your children, wherever
[1:57:22] they are. Keep keep lifting us higher.
[1:57:23] We want to soar high. We want to look
[1:57:25] down. We want to see things clearly from
[1:57:27] that point of view, Lord, where we can
[1:57:30] in this eagle age, the anointing that's
[1:57:32] on us, Lord, help us. We pray. We love
[1:57:33] you, Lord. We bless your name. We thank
[1:57:35] you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. Brother
[1:57:38] Chad, the Lord is good.
[1:57:47] Something in my heart, like a stream
[1:57:51] running
[1:57:53] down, makes me feel so happy, as happy
[1:57:58] as can
[1:57:59] be. When I think of Jesus and what he's
[1:58:04] done for me, gives me
[1:58:07] something more than gold in my soul. Oh
[1:58:11] yes. There's something more than
[1:58:16] gold. Oh
[1:58:19] yes. Oh
[1:58:22] yes. There is something more than
[1:58:27] gold. Oh
[1:58:30] yes. Oh
[1:58:33] yes. There is
[1:58:35] something more than gold in my soul.
[1:58:40] Yes. There's something more than
[1:58:44] gold. Oh
[1:58:47] yes. Oh
[1:58:50] yes. There is something more than
[1:58:55] gold. Oh
[1:58:58] yes. Oh
[1:59:01] yes. There is something more than gold
[1:59:06] in my soul. Yes. There's something more
[1:59:10] than
[1:59:13] gold. Amen. What a privilege. Amen. To
[1:59:17] know the truth of this hour. Amen. I was
[1:59:20] so blessed by that analogy of driving
[1:59:23] 120 more miles an hour than going to 60.
[1:59:26] Hey, listen. Our bad day isn't really a
[1:59:29] bad day. On the worst day, we still know
[1:59:32] where we came from and where we're going
[1:59:34] and what God's doing. Praise the Lord.
[1:59:37] there. There's no more bad days,
[1:59:39] friends, because of the revelation.
[1:59:41] Thank God. And it's that breaking away
[1:59:44] of the amnesia that gives us the
[1:59:46] strength just to be what he wants us to
[1:59:48] be on a high, on what we feel like a
[1:59:51] low. Just let the word flow. Amen.
[1:59:54] Praise God. Oh, it was good for me.
[1:59:57] Amen. It's been good to have brother
[1:59:59] Simon and his family. God bless you all
[2:00:01] as you travel home. They'll be leaving
[2:00:03] pretty much immediately after the
[2:00:05] service. So, we want to remember them in
[2:00:07] prayer as we close that God will bless
[2:00:09] them, take them home safely, and all the
[2:00:12] that he poured out, God will pour in
[2:00:15] many times over. Amen. I love the
[2:00:18] drawings. He can use the whiteboard so
[2:00:20] much better than me. I learn something
[2:00:22] new every time he uses it. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:25] We're just going to bow our heads and
[2:00:26] pray. But also before that, I want to
[2:00:28] remind you the picnic tomorrow. those
[2:00:31] who were able to come. It's wonderful to
[2:00:32] be able to spend the time together. So,
[2:00:34] we look forward to seeing you there
[2:00:36] tomorrow. Let's bow our heads
[2:00:38] together. Dear heavenly father, we're
[2:00:40] thankful for this word that you've given
[2:00:43] us, Lord. This reminder of how blessed
[2:00:46] we really are, God. Surely life has ups
[2:00:50] and downs. It has discouraging things
[2:00:52] and disappointing things, but through it
[2:00:54] all, we are so abundantly blessed.
[2:00:58] You've taken us to the highest heights,
[2:01:00] Lord. And you want to take us higher
[2:01:02] still. And you've showed us things,
[2:01:04] Lord, that are unfathomable to a human
[2:01:07] mind. And God, may those things be the
[2:01:10] things that change us, Lord, that take
[2:01:13] away that that amnesia that we were born
[2:01:16] with, that give us that heavenly
[2:01:17] perspective, so that now we can place
[2:01:20] everything in life appropriately where
[2:01:21] it belongs. That we're no longer under
[2:01:24] deception of the enemy, under the lies.
[2:01:27] But Lord, the truth has truly set us
[2:01:30] free. And may that freedom, Lord, become
[2:01:33] a life that's lived in us where
[2:01:35] everything in life, Lord, becomes an
[2:01:37] opportunity for us to reflect your life.
[2:01:40] This message, Lord, this word that can
[2:01:43] come out of our mouth, that can come
[2:01:44] through our actions, that can come
[2:01:46] through the way we love. God, we want
[2:01:49] you to have us and use us. Lord Jesus,
[2:01:52] we ask a special blessing over the
[2:01:54] Abbott family, brother Simon and Sister
[2:01:56] Miriam, their children. Lord, as they
[2:01:59] travel home, would you take them safely
[2:02:00] in their journey home, watch them on the
[2:02:02] roads and in the planes and through the
[2:02:04] airports until they arrive safely in
[2:02:06] their home. And may you strengthen our
[2:02:09] brother Simon and encourage him in the
[2:02:11] family and pour many times over back
[2:02:13] into them what they poured out. For
[2:02:15] Lord, he's been a vessel that's been
[2:02:17] willing to be used by you. And I pray
[2:02:19] you'd bless him for it. And God, may
[2:02:22] everything we heard and been hearing,
[2:02:24] may it become reality in our lives,
[2:02:26] Lord. And may it sustain us through
[2:02:28] every temptation and every trial. May
[2:02:31] the breaking of amnesia place us
[2:02:33] properly and give us the right
[2:02:35] understanding and the right expression
[2:02:37] in every hour. For God, we are here to
[2:02:41] live your life on this earth through
[2:02:42] these bodies. And God, we need your help
[2:02:45] to do it. But you're helping us by
[2:02:47] opening our eyes. Bless us, Lord. Bless
[2:02:50] each one as we go. Bless us tomorrow as
[2:02:52] we gather together in fellowship. May
[2:02:54] your blessing be upon us there as well.
[2:02:57] We love you. We thank you for all you've
[2:02:59] given to us. In Jesus Christ's name we
[2:03:02] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all.
[2:03:07] Brother, something in my heart like a
[2:03:12] stream makes me feel so happy as happy
[2:03:17] as can be.
[2:03:19] When I think of Jesus and what he's done
[2:03:23] for me, gives me something more than
[2:03:27] gold in my soul. Yes. There's something
[2:03:32] more than
[2:03:34] gold. Oh
[2:03:37] yes. Oh
[2:03:39] yes. There is something more than gold.
[2:03:46] Oh
[2:03:48] yes. Oh
[2:03:50] yes. There is something more than gold
[2:03:55] in my soul. Yes. There's something more
[2:03:59] than
[2:04:02] gold to B
[2:04:05] flat. Oh glorious victory.
[2:04:11] That day he set me
[2:04:15] free and he made my
[2:04:21] heart his very
[2:04:26] throne. My life is no longer
[2:04:31] mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[2:04:38] And now I
[2:04:42] live to praise his
[2:04:47] name.
[2:04:48] Oh I am
[2:04:53] Lord. It's who I
[2:04:58] am. Oh I can see
[2:05:03] now just who I am.
[2:05:10] I'm part of my
[2:05:13] savior. Oh, I'm a part of his
[2:05:19] word. It's a
[2:05:24] revelation. It's
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:30] predestination of who I am.
[2:05:36] On
[2:05:38] Calary he
[2:05:40] died to redeem his lost
[2:05:46] bride. The King of
[2:05:51] Kings became my Savior.
[2:05:57] Oh, this is God's great
[2:06:02] mystery of love expressed to
[2:06:07] me that rise and
[2:06:13] I
[2:06:18] my oh who I am
[2:06:23] Lord is who I
[2:06:30] Oh, I can see
[2:06:34] now just who I
[2:06:39] am. I'm part of my
[2:06:44] Savior. Oh, I'm a part of his
[2:06:50] word. It's a revelation.
[2:06:56] It's
[2:07:01] predestination of who I
[2:07:04] am. Sing the chorus one more time. Oh,
[2:07:07] who I am,
[2:07:11] Lord. It's who I am.
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:18] I can see
[2:07:22] now just who I
[2:07:27] am. I'm part of my
[2:07:32] Savior. I'm a part of his
[2:07:38] word. It's a revelation.
[2:07:43] [Music]
[2:07:44] It's
[2:07:46] [Music]
[2:07:48] predestination of who I am.
