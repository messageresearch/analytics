follow in the fellowship hall so we can gather there with the family i want to say a special thanks for brother keith and sister lee hunting god bless you it's good to have you here you're very welcome but when they heard that brother john wasn't doing well sister nancy had called them in the morning and they called him in the morning i think it was friday morning that she called them and they said we want to come up so i stopped at the hospital friday morning and talked to sister nancy and she said brother keith and sister lee are coming up and i said oh that'll be good and i was thinking they'll be here tomorrow or the next day or or whatever and at the end of the day i stopped back by in the evening like 5 30 and i opened the door and they were there and i said how did you get here so fast and god just supernaturally put all the pieces together and it was so wonderful not only could they be here to see brother john before he passed away but they've been able to stay with sister nancy and help take care of her and comfort her and so god bless you we thank you so much for that and i'm so glad that god worked that out that way for her amen so remember to keep her in prayer and that god will support her and sustain her and undergird her through this time and uh that the lord will bless the memorial service coming up this saturday so we very much appreciate your prayers amen let's turn to the scripture here and begin reading in john chapter 1 verse 1. it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god we're going to let you have your seats with that and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word amen there's just a few things that are on my heart that i like to share you know from sunday i we finished up sunday and the lord really blessed us with the word on sunday and i i was very much edified and i went home monday and i was up in the morning monday morning reading through the bible and i took out some of my notes and i'm just reading through some handwritten notes and and as i was reading through that i just was enjoying it all over again monday morning and there was something that i wrote down that that i didn't get to on uh on sunday and i thought um i'd like to share that so that's where this stems from today but i'd like to title this the thought expressed the thought expressed and and we know that that comes from this word here in genesis or sorry john chapter one verse one in the beginning was the word that that word that's translated word into english comes from the greek word logos and we'll get to the meaning of that in just a minute but we know that logos is a thought expressed is what brother brenham told us and that's what we want to talk about today and the message the way back brother brennan says and if you say you believe god and deny his word well then you don't believe god because god is his word let's just make it that simple can we have it that simple if you say you believe god and deny his word well then you don't believe god because god is his word you know it sounds so simple yeah we yeah that's a piece of cake we believe that but you realize then to deny the word of god is to deny god because god is his word and so you know what was satan's tactics amen when he met jesus in the wilderness he was constantly trying to get jesus to deviate from the word and and how was he trying to get jesus to deviate from the word he was using the word to get jesus to deviate from the word so he would use scripture and he would use jesus's calling in his position as the son of god which is it was his manifested word so jesus as the son of god was the manifested word he tried to use his position as the manifested word amen he tried to use the scripture amen he tried to use the supernatural amen which is also a product of the word he tried all of these things to get jesus off the word and he was using things from the word to get him off the word and that's the that's been the trick of the devil all along and we see that coming in amen through the through the systems of man through the denominations and the systems of man they've been using scripture to deviate off of the word and like we said sunday you can have the scripture and not have the word amen because the word is the thought expressed so the word the true word of god contains god's thought about that word so if we agree if we quote the word without god's thought attached to that word and we have our thought what we think that word means then we've deviated off the word but we may be reading the scripture and reading it correctly the way it's written in the bible so we can correctly read the the scripture with the way it's written but if we don't catch the thought amen and we inject our thought into the reading of that scripture then it's no longer the word amen it's no longer the word of god it's no longer the word it becomes perverted word so we say you know if you believe god and deny his word then you don't believe god because god is his word amen you have to realize we when we're talking now and the depth of deception that the devil has laid down the devil is not amen he's not trying to deceive us into you know into believing uh uh some far-fetched thing or are our way way way out and in the middle of nowhere kind of a deception to get us pulled off to where we no longer you know believe that the message is true and no what he can do is write with the message the quotes and the scriptures were taken to the message try to deviate us from god's thought about the message [Music] until we start taking our thinking about the message and it brings a perverted word so the devil and the deception when he came to jesus he was using the word he used the scriptures to try to get jesus to move off of god's purpose and plan for his life and deviate from the word so you can see how important it is amen that we don't inject our own idea so this is actually a lot more difficult than we think so we re we hear this quote and we think yeah that's easy i would you know i have no desire to deny his word but the devil's not trying to get you to say that this scripture is not even belonging in the bible you know he's not trying to get you to say that brother branham was never a prophet amen if he can just get you to deny the correct interpretation of the word and take a different interpretation of the word he's just as effective so like i said there's so many things on my heart so just bear with me as i just share from my heart god was so good to us in this day to give us the complete revelation of his word now how many believe that through the message we have the complete revelation of the word the full mind of god has been restored back into the church we have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication amen so so what we have is by the grace of god is something that will defeat the devil any place any time under any condition but we have to take it the way god gave it to us amen we can't change it or alter it we can't begin to massage the message we we shouldn't apologize for the way brother ben says things [Applause] we put and shouldn't apologize for the way he used his scriptures because you know even brother brennaman and when he was uh alive he was telling us you know that uh some man uh uh we assume is probably somebody with a great education was coming to brother branham and saying brother branham you don't even know your bible and the man was talking about you know the actual text or the pronunciations or whatever he's talking about the grammarization or whatever you don't even know the bible brother ben said that may be true but i know the author real well now listen if you want to get grammar and you want to get greek amen then then then you just know your bible really well but if you want the logos the word you need to know the author really well because this word that is written down here is a written expression of a thought god had in his mind and so in order to have the true word that's why brother benham also said it this way he said they've been you say we try to get a better bible better translated off the greek brother brenham said they've been arguing about the greek for over a thousand years you can't get two greek scholars to agree and so how can we with a better interpretation of the word come up with a true translation of the word amen the only way to have a true translation of the word is not to get a better greek dictionary or a better understanding of a greek but to get the true interpretation has to come from the author of the word because the true interpretation contains the thought of that word because that's the true interpretation of that word so i'd like to ask you in the day and age that we live in how will you ever get the correct interpretation of your bible without the message that god has given us how can you reject the prophet to get the correct translation of a bible verse and without a prophet amen how will you know that what you came up with was what was in the back part of god's mind before the foundation of the world [Music] i want to go to the one who knows the author really well [Music] for instance you can find a note of mine i can write out a note and some thoughts of mine and i can drop it somewhere and you can pick it up and have my signature and it's got you can say oh brother chad this is he said this and he said that and you think you understand what i'm saying but if you want a better understanding of what i'm saying give that note to my wife and she'll translate it for you because she knows the author really well you can be like oh brother chad said this and this and he'd be like no he always misspells that word listen that's not what he meant he can't spell that because she knows the author really well and so if i want the correct translation of god's love letter to me i want to go to somebody who knows the author [Music] and further than that i have to get into the same spirit that that man was in [Music] i can't come with a different spirit because if i come with a different spirit and don't have the spirit of the author without the spirit of the it was the spirit of the author of the bible who gave the message to the prophet brother bram didn't come up with the message it was given to him by the author of our bible the author of our bible is the author of the message [Music] and so i have to have the same spirit as the author of the bible and to author the message to come to the mess to get the correct translation of the message so we have to be careful how we handle the word and so too many people are arguing over the word amen and when you just have to get into the spirit of the word and trust god's mechanism for delivering his word which was that prophet it's when we which when we it's when we get convinced in our mind that we can't trust the prophet because of his grammar or his reading or his this or that when when somehow somebody uh deceives us into believing that we can't trust the prophet we're going to get off into into terrible places that prophet of god was led of the lord and he he was given the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication and let me go a little further so i can keep with this thought let's go over to john 1 verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and brother branham said and because god is his word and that word was made flesh so in the very very beginning god had thoughts and those thoughts when those thoughts were expressed became word and they could be spoken word they can be written word but those thoughts expressed became word then then those words amen come into a manifestation and become manifested word our living word and the word was made flesh and all that god had in this thought all of the word that was in god in his thinking amen becomes into flesh in jesus christ and becomes not written word or spoken word but now manifested word so jesus christ he's standing on earth and he's the very manifested word with the full thought of god in him he is the revelation of god amen and the pharisees thought they knew the law better than him and the pharisees would challenge him on the word on the scriptures on the law amen but here he was he was all of that amen was poured into him and he was the very manifestation of of the full thought of god he was the manifestation of god he was the word made flesh he was manifested word standing there and they thought that he wasn't handling the word correctly and they were trying to correct him by the law and here he was the manifestation of everything that was written in that law so we look at the pharisees and just shake our heads like how could you i mean how could you argue with him how could you question him how could you do anything like that but the sad part is there'll be people who claim to believe this message will do the very same thing with the prophet of god for instance the prophet of god will tell us to avoid interracial marriage and you know how many times that's been explained away people will explain that away and say well you know in the bible and moses had an ethiopian wife and this and that and you know somebody told me that one time when moses had an ethiopian wife and i said david had 500 wives i mean try that one out just because god permitted it in a previous age doesn't mean doesn't make it work in the next age when more light comes because when more light comes more is required when more revelation comes more of a life is required david could have 500 wives amen but you can't so just because those things took place before does not mean that they're appropriate now and if a prophet of god teaches something over and over and over again i mean this isn't something it's not a one-off statement it's not something that said in obscurity this is something he teaches over and over and he bases it on the very nature of god because he said god is a god of variety god made this flower this color and he wants them to stay just that way he doesn't want him to mix and brother branham says that so i'm just using this as an example where people will come and say but i don't know the scripture that he used for that and i see about moses and i see in the old testament they did this and this and i'm just going to take what brother bannon said and move it over here and and then we'll say things like you know that was his opinion now he was coming up in the 60s and there was major racial things taking place in the 60s so the environment he was in was influencing his opinion i'm telling if you start down that road that's a dead-end road that'll bring major problems he does this on marriage and divorce he does this on the qualifications of a minister brother branham he he knows the author real well and when he's telling you and he is the one who has the revelation that's been in the back part of god's mind since before the foundation of the world amen he he has he has been given revelation that has been secret and withheld from every other prophet amen down through time there's there's never been a prophet like this prophet amen outside of jesus christ this is the prophet that's going to come and take the veil off the entire word which prophet did that before then how could we come along and start saying well that was his opinion and i don't see where he got that see it won't be long until the devil will have us in a perversion of the word taking our own thinking and moving in directions by our own thinking so if brother branham said this is the qualifications for a minister that's the qualifications for a minister if you said this is what this is what this is what god wants in our marriages this is who he wants us to marry not marry then that's who god wants us to marry and not marry if he says these are who can get remarried and these can't get remarried then that's who can get married who can't get remarried you see what a disrespect it is to the prophet of god to just totally disregard what he taught because we know better i say god help us never to have that let's humble ourselves to what god has given us in this day in the pergameon church age brother brother says now we can see his association with the word he is the word that is who he is the word in his name in john 1 1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root from which we get our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech now a thought expressed is a word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful john says the concept of god was expressed in jesus so jesus was the word the logos because the concept of god was expressed in jesus so this is where brother tells us that this is one of many places he tells us that a thought expresses the word when you look in the in the concordance it actually even uses this language it says a word that embodies embodies a concept or idea so it's not just something that's written down the word embodies within it the concept or idea that the person who wrote the word or the person who came up with the word it was the concept or idea that they had with that word so in order to have the correct interpretation of the word we have to have god's concept or idea of what he meant by that word praise god i want to take a a look at luke chapter 6 together luke chapter 6 and verse 1. and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the cornfields and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat rubbing them in their hands and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days this is what these are these are these statements in the bible that i find so shocking because we know who this was this is the very word himself and then says why are you violating the word the word can't violate the word so their understanding of what moses meant amen wasn't the correct interpretation of the word although they have words that they can read and come up with that conclusion they were missing something amen and it says pluck the ears of corn and did eat rubbing them in their hands verse two and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do you that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days and jesus answered them and said have you not read so much as this what david did when when himself was a hunger and they which were with him how he went to the house of god and did take and eat the show bread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the priest alone and he said unto them that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath and it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was withered and the scribes and the pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him but he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the withered hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he arose and stood forth then said jesus unto them i will ask you one thing is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it and looking around about upon them all he said unto the man stretch forth thy hand and he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other and they were filled with madness look at this scripture they were filled with madness and commune one with another what they might do to jesus listen they were so consumed with their own understanding of the scriptures and here they are looking at the word made flesh in front of them the very revelation of god the manifested word was there and they were so locked down on text that they could read them print and and marks amen and with their own interpretation and they had gotten it so wound up with their own will and their own thoughts amen that they had missed the original thought of god when when he gave that scripture and here jesus is here and they're wanting to see whether he'll heal a man and these people are so twisted up in their minds on the word that they would rather a man stay crippled they would prefer that a man stay crippled in his arm there that be healed on the sabbath day so that that so that their understanding of the scripture will stay intact so that their power over the people so that their influence and so that their own interpretation they value their own interpretation of the word so much they do not want a man to go free would prefer he would stay bound on the sabbath day to keep their interpretation of the word intact that is wickedness and jesus says i ask you one thing is it better to do good on the sabbath day or to do evil i love the way jesus asks questions because there's no way they're going to answer they're saying well i mean well i mean you can't heal them but i can't say evil so we'll just keep quiet they asked jesus by what authority do you do these things when he ran the money changes out of the temple and he said well i'll ask you one question you answer mine i'll answer yours you know the the ministry of john was it of god or as of man and all of a sudden they they're put in a quandary they can't answer either way because they have no ability within themselves to be honest they're not interested in the honest interpretation of the word they're interested in keeping their position and the facade before the people and being the experts and having the correct that's all they care about and so they're so wicked that they would rather a man-state and when jesus christ amen says sets forth thy hand and the man was made every bit whole there was not one drop of rejoicing in their hearts for the man that was made whole they were filled with madness because jesus destroyed their interpretation of the scripture my goodness one thing i've learned is human beings are pathetic creatures god help us and save us fill us with your spirit lord because the spirit of man is so corrupt and so polluted human beings are pathetic jesus says to a group of pharisees in mark chapter 2 he says the sabbath was made for man not man for the sabbath they got so twisted up and they didn't realize that god had created a sabbath now remember the sabbath was outside the law it was part of the ten commandments the ten commandments were not the law the ten commandments were a covenant between god and his people and it was going to be a marriage covenant the book of ordinances came after they refused to come up to the mountain so god gave the ten commandments as a marriage covenant as protection and love and instruction for a wife that's how they were given amen and when he gave the commandment for the sabbath amen the sabbath he said remember the sabbath to keep it holy and jesus comes and says this the man was not created to serve the sabbath but sabbath was for the man god had given it to him for rest god had given it to him for reprieve god had given it to him for worship amen but the pharisees had taken the precious word of god and had twisted it until they brought man under bondage and made man to serve the sabbath and said sabbath to serve the man but jesus had the mind of god and with the mind of god he could give him the correct understanding of the sabbath and when he gave him the correct understanding of the sabbath they were filled with madness and had to get rid of him praise be to god some things never change and the message thirst it says because jesus said if we add one word to this or take one word from it our part is taken out of the book of life see not one scripture we must take it just the way it's written and god watches over his word to perform it and we know that it's got to be just right so therefore no matter what a church would say what anybody else would say if you're born of the spirit of god you become part of the bible this is so important you can never understand the bible until you're born of the spirit of god and become the same thing the bible is you become part of the bible and god told ezekiel the prophet he said take the scroll and eat it then the prophet and the scroll become part of each other and that's the believer when he receives the holy spirit the holy spirit wrote the bible and the spirit of god is the word of god you catch that you can't say well i want the spirit and then i'll have the word the spirit and the word are the same thing so the spirit of god is the word of god and so you'll never understand the word of god without the spirit of god he said my words are spirit in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and one among us hebrews 13 8 he is the same yesterday today and forever and when you are part of that word and then let something come up contrary to that word now listen what he's saying once you once you've got the baptism of the holy ghost and you fed on the word and you and the word are the same thing he said when you are part of that word and then let something come up contrary to that word there's a little buzzer sets off right quick see and it's to warn you that death is in the road without the spirit of god what will we do use our minds you know i mean that might not have been a scary proposition when i was 20 some years old and i thought i was great but god has allowed time to put a few beat downs some mistakes some falls poor decisions poor poor poor decisions wrong thinking wrong judgments wrong words offenses and contradictions and i've got so many of those things right now amen and i don't know what the next 20 years will hold but i'm to the point now where i do not want to rely on anything that comes from my thinking amen because it's so damaging to me every time i rely on my own thinking i want the mind of god amen you've got to have the spirit of god we've got to get into the same spirit of the composer before we can play our part and we have to there's no way to understand this bible amen without the message and without being in the same spirit the message is in let's go to john chapter 8. i just want to read a few more places and then hopefully keep moving and i just want to say that the thing that i wrote down that i was looking at monday morning is right before i came out to the pulpit i wrote something down really quickly and i wrote down the nature of god is in his word so the nature of god is in his word and i'm talking about his word not man's interpretation of his word but the nature of god because the thought of god is his word and god is his thoughts so god's thought cannot have a different nature than god god this bible says as a man think is in his heart so is he amen god's thoughts are his nature it is his person and so god's the the nature of god is in his word so when god speaks a word it comes from his thought it contains his thought it contains his attributes it contains his nature so the nature of god is in his word the application of his word must carry the same nature so just think about that so the nature of god is in his word the application of the word must carry the same nature so if i take this scripture verse and i apply it with a different nature then it's no longer god's word listen you say what are you talking about you haven't rearranged any of the words you haven't changed any of the black text on the white paper but when it's no longer contains the thought of god but now it has a man's thought and it gets applied according to a man's thinking that is no longer the word of god because you cannot do you cannot attribute what man does with god's word to being god's nature man has done all kinds of things with god's word what they were doing there that day when when when jesus was there on the sabbath day in the synagogue and they would prefer a man stay crippled they prefer a man stays in bondage on the sabbath then the let a man go free on the sabbath why because their hearts were absolutely wicked they were doing something with the word of god that did not contain the nature of god so you can no longer call that the word of god but they can quote to you verbatim what moses said but jesus is looking at him and saying you don't even know god i know him you don't know him amen amen oh praise god john chapter 8 verse 3. and the scribes and the pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery referred to this sunday and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses and the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou oh oh they thought they had him caught a woman in the very act of adultery caught her red-handed brought her to jesus and quoted the scriptures the law of moses said she ought to be stoned what do you say basically are you going to contradict moses and when we when we see the story unfold jesus wasn't the one contradicting moses the ones who were quoting moses were the ones contradicting moses they were quoting moses and contradicting moses amen let's keep reading he said the master this woman was taken in adultery the very act now moses and the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what say us down uh verse six this they said tempting him tempting him that they might have to accuse him they had no desire to keep the law they were using the word to contradict they were using i said let me be careful in how i word this they were using the scripture to contradict the manifested word listen when somebody tries to use a scripture against the message when somebody tries to use a scripture to contradict something brother brenham taught i want to ask you where did that spirit come from but they have the scripture but it doesn't mean they have the word to have the word you have to have the thought praise god this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground and as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they walk and and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the oldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in in the midst and when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where where are those thine accusers have no man condemned thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more see in order for them to have a proper application of this word of moses they have to have the nature of the word the proper application of the word will always carry the nature of the word and so now they're looking for an application of the word but they do not have the nature of god in this application they're using it to trip up or trap or contradict the manifested word and then they care nothing about keeping the law all they care about is contradicting jesus christ and then they care nothing about this woman or the purity in israel or are the perfection in the camp they care nothing about the things that that law was written about they don't care about keeping the camp clean that's not what they're interested in they're only interested in manipulating that scripture for their own purpose and then they don't even apply the scripture correctly because the scripture says amen if they're caught in adultery the man and the woman are to be stoned but there's no man present but they knew the man because they caught her in the very act of adultery right so now they're trying to apply the justice of god without the righteousness of god because they were not acting righteously because they knew better they knew this was a setup they knew this was not true they knew that the man should have been brought and he was left out they knew all of the they knew that they were wrong according to the word so they were trying to get justice without righteousness but god's justice is never absent of his righteousness so in order to find the right application for the word you have to have the right nature the right application of the word will carry the right nature of the word so jesus knew the word jesus never contradicted the word they never said you're not quoting the scriptures they never said moses never said that amen he just he just put a challenge to them you that are without sin cast the first stone they all walked away because jesus is the master of the word he is the manifested word he has the mind of god amen he is the revelation of god and he's standing there and he looks at the woman he says woman where are thine accusers perfect question because nobody can be stoned without the witness of two or three so he says where are thine accusers she says i have none he said neither do i accuse you and she could never be stoned on the accusations of one alone anyways had to be two or three he said neither do i accuse you listen to what he says go and sin no more he knew she was sinning but he could stay true to the law he could stay true to the nature of god and he could send this woman away with an admonition go and sin no more because he knew that what they were asking for was part of the word of god without all of the word of god see there may be things that we don't understand in the message there may be things that maybe don't compute into our mind and we haven't been able to figure out where brother branham got that in the scriptures or why he says it that way but when the entire amen revelation of the word was given out amen now when brother branham is preaching the scriptures he's taking the entirety of the word into play amen it's like jesus christ standing there he has the full mind of god the full word of god and they bring a part of the scripture but he's got all of the scripture of the nature all of the thought all of the mind to apply and he has the perfect correct application of the word so the prophet of god now amen he's been called into a special position and he's been he's been given a revelation of the scriptures of revelation he has the mind of christ and now he's bringing the word but he's not bringing the word with a partial understanding like in luther's day or a partial understanding in wesley's day this is no longer a partial application of the word but now we've got the full measure of the word and god has given to us amen the fullness of the word and the prophet when he's teaching something he knows the author real well so those things we don't understand they're not things to throw away they're not things to contradict they're things to say i trust i trust the mechanism that god has used to bring me instruction in this day i trust that voice i trust that gift i trust god i trust god that if that prophet was wrong that prophet would have corrected himself because i trust god to give me a true voice [Music] i trust god amen to give a gift that won't steer me in the wrong direction and won't give me wrong scriptures and won't give his opinion as law the real question is do we trust what god's given us or not [Music] i don't know i can't really explain why this is so heavy on my heart but it's become so heavy on my heart that we cannot pick and choose out of the message we cannot do what every age has done before or we will wind up like every age has wound up before but there's prophesied a predestinated bride that it will not go that way but don't you think there's not a devil trying to pull the same tactics he's done in every age trying to do it to you and i today if he could tempt jesus in the wilderness he could come to you with scriptures with examples with story and try to get a deviation off the word in our lives like he was trying to do with jesus christ that day who was the manifested word well what is the bride for this day she is the manifested word where is the devil's attack come to the manifested word what's he attacking he's using the very word that she's here to manifest to try to deviate her off the word and for some reason i can't explain why other than a burden i am so burdened with this to say you know god i do not want any of my thinking i'm so tired of my own thinking tired of my own explanations and tired of everybody else's explanations i want your spirit amen to give me that little buzzer on the inside and i want to stick with the gift that you sent in this day to bring your mind the mind of the author has come through this message and i'm not about to say well brother branham was wrong on that and he was wrong on that and that was his opinion and i'm not about to go there friends if i don't understand it i have no problem saying i don't understand what he's saying but i am not going to say that he is teaching that wrong or else i'm saying that god sent me a vessel that i can't trust to teach the word correctly [Music] and now i've got to rely on what i think or the scriptures that i can find but the real problem with that is as time goes on i keep finding more scriptures that vindicate what brother better taught that i never knew were in the bible so why would i discount something he teaches now because i can't find the scriptures in the bible when all along the way i'm constantly finding more scriptures in the bible that vindicate what he taught and i didn't know those scriptures were in the bible so if i would say what brother i'm taught there is not in the bible what i'm saying is i know the bible better than the prophet of god none of us would stand up and say that no i i know the bible better but if you say brother brown taught that and that's nowhere in the bible then why did he teach it why did he teach it as a concept of god why did he teach it as part of god's nature why did he teach it as relevant to the message today why did he repeat it multiple times if it's not if it's not relevant if it's not something see see how dangerous this becomes we say well this is a little issue but there's all kinds of issues and this becomes extremely extremely dangerous when we begin to go down these paths i'd rather come back to the path as i trust i trust the gift that god placed and i trust the office of a prophet and i trust that and i'm when i say i'm trusting that i'm trusting god who vindicated that god would not have thoroughly vindicated something and left me in error on part of the word unless he would have come and fixed it let's look at matthew 23. i'm not getting very far in my notes but i hope that you're catching my burden and i hope you also understand what i'm saying because there's absolutely nothing legalistic in what i'm saying because it's not about strict adherence to something for the sake of being saved it's about a respect for an office god placed it's about understanding god was the one who backed this man up god was the one who proved and vindicated over and over again that this is my mouthpiece brother bennett in one message he says i am the mouthpiece of god to you or i am the voice of god to you he stops he said i didn't say that he said that amen what i'm saying is having respect for that matthew 23 23 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought to you you to these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone jesus says you caught you caught the surface you caught the tithing you caught this but you missed judgment mercy and faith judgment mercy and faith was not laying on the surface judgment and mercy and faith was the nature behind the instructions because the instructions showed god's judgment the instructions showed god's mercy the instructions give you faith in the word of god those were laying those were contained within the instructions they were deeper than the surface they got the surface i got to pay tithe of this i got to do this and i got to do that and i dressed this way and i look this way and i do this and if i do all of that but they missed the very nature of god that was coming through because paul says the law was not flawed paul said the law was perfect because it's part of the word and it's part of god the flaw was mankind to keep the law it wasn't the problem with the law so it contained the very nature of god judgment and mercy and faith and they missed the deeper things and caught the surface jesus he talked he tells them the spirit it's the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life they're more than just instructions the words they also contain the spirit and the life when they contain the thought of god because god's thoughts are eternal so they contain the lies now i'd like to share a few quotes here referring to the ministry of brother branham he says in the message spiritual food and due season so we find out that when a man comes sent from god ordained of god with the truth thus saith the lord the message and the messenger are one and the same because he is sent to represent thus saith the lord word by word so he and his message is the same i just want you to lock that in that the message and the messenger are one and the same that he came to represent thus saith the lord word by word so he and his message is the same i want you to hold on to that i want to read a couple other quotes and come back to this the word of god says in hebrews the fourth fourth chapter he says the word of god is more powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword cutting to the asunder of the morrow of the bone and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the harm it's the word and every time that a prophet came he come with the word and he was the word for that age he caught that god is his own interpreter 1964. so he come with the word and he was the word for that age who the messenger the prophet he become the word for that age and the feast of trumpets he said look i want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking from the seventh angels message but he injects a statement it's in it's in parentheses here he's saying that the sentence reads like this uh look i want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking from the seventh angel's message but he injects something in the sentence and he says messenger of the seventh seal okay uh if you could turn the white board on for me i want to write down something so he injects this messenger of the seventh seal message in revelation 10 was the seventh seal to the seventh trumpet between those two times so he's explaining something else but he injects the statement in the sentence the messenger of the seventh seal so brother branham says that the seventh angel is the messenger of the seventh is seal what he says then he says the messenger am i spelling that right i don't care the messenger and his message is one and the same so what's he telling us if you want to see the seventh seal look at the messenger he's the messenger of the seventh seal because his message was not tying together the loose ends his message was revelation 10 1-7 the seven thunders he was he was the messenger of the seventh seal and the messenger and his message are one in the same praise god and the message is the masterpiece he says now what did he say in revelation 10 that would take place why was the trip to tucson to open the church open to the church in the days of the messenger of the seventh angel the seventh angel message the whole word of god would be made manifest the seal that what all the stalk has left off of what all about it would be made manifest in this time so what was revelation 10 to do the whole word of god would be made manifest in the message of guide from 1962 he says that's the reason the coming of the of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being so what was the what was the coming of the seals the finishing of the seventh seal this is this is revelation 10 7. at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives how he lives his nature his being the seventh seal didn't come for information the seventh seal was not given to us in information the seventh seal was given to us in demonstration [Music] i'd like to say this way if you go onto youtube and you watch testimonies of brother branham and there's a myriad of people who were with the prophet spent a lot of time with them hunting buddies minister friends people witness church all kinds family members all kinds of people give testimonies and you can go in there and listen to them which i thoroughly enjoyed doing i listen i love listening to the life of the prophet like i love listening to the tapes when he's telling his stories when he's explaining his experiences with god all of these things listen there's a reason we've got all these tapes there's a reason we got all these tapes and we don't just have little segments but we've got the whole picture there's reasons why this man's life is on display there's a reason why it came in this day when his life could be recorded his voice could be recorded his stories his mistakes his repentance his experiences with god on the mountaintop i mean his experience is a businessman fellowships with ministers with friends with his wife amen there's a reason all that's on display amen because at the end of the seventh seal amen we're going to know how god lives [Music] we're going to know his nature amen we're going to know what god is like what the manifestation of god is supposed to be in this hour and so if you look at all these testimonies and you look at the doctrinal differences in the people who are sharing the testimonies you'll have somebody who will give a testimony that doesn't believe the seventh seal is open you have somebody else that will share a testimony that doesn't believe brother bear is the fulfillment of revelation 10 7. you have somebody else who will give a testimony that doesn't believe in fightful ministry should only listen to tapes you have somebody else that will share a testimony amen that believes that brother venom has to come back in a return ministry to fix everything right and i'm not contradicting him i'm not saying if they're right or wrong i'm just saying these are the different different doctrines that the people believe you have some people who believe that the seals are open and brother branham was fulfilling malachi 4 and revelation 10 7. you have all of these doctrinal differences when it comes to believing the doctrine of the message these individuals are as far apart as east is from west they cannot agree on the doctrine of the message but if you listen to every one of their testimonies when they describe the life of that man their testimonies all line up like this and they give the exact same testimony of the life that man lived i don't think that is coincidence you have somebody who will even question whether he's not he's revelation 10 7 but they'll give the seven testimony of his life somebody who believes he's got to come and return and and finish the message he'll give the same testimony you have somebody who believes he's already done it all and won't return same testimony somebody who believes in fightful ministry same testimony somebody who doesn't believe in fightful ministry same testimony because the man's life was the reflection of jesus christ in flesh and his life did not deviate with who w with from with whom he was spending time with you don't get a separate testimony from his son that you do from his hunting partner you don't get a separate testimony from his hunting buddy that you do with his minister friend you don't get a different testimony from his wife that you do from those that were with him in alaska hunting you get the same testimony of the same character the same nature the same life it all runs true through everybody's testimony [Music] see to me brother branham's life is a product of his revelation and so if that man with all the revelation you say who's right you know we've got this doctrine this doctrine this doctrine for for me i don't really care about being right i don't i'm going to say this wrong but i don't care about being known for being right in my doctrine but i want that same life he lived because i think that's the purpose of the teaching i think that's the purpose of the opening of the seals i think that was the purpose of the return of the word to bring the full life of jesus christ back into a body of believers so that it can be manifest in a living word a living attribute of god jesus christ on display in flesh is what i think the whole purpose of the message was so all those testimonies of his life is demonstrating the purpose of the message so that means for me all the doctrine i believe i want to line up to that life and if i believe a doctrine that moves me over here i want to reject that doctrine because i want the doctrine that pulls me in line with this life because this life is the display of jesus christ in flesh [Music] remember brother bam told us that on the plains of memory it was elohim god himself that stepped into human flesh to tell sarah the what the secret of her heart and the tent behind her and then after he would explain that in the sermon he would turn us back to the crowd and he would begin to share what's in the heart of some individuals in the audience behind him showing that the same thing that was on the plains of memory is here now what is that elohim god himself in a human body amen i mean tell me who else has done that where else have you seen that who else can say such things you remember dawson reilly's testimony and he says brother ben was talking to him one day and said you know up in canada he said they're baptizing in my name and it was really troubling brother branham and dawson riley riley he was like wow how can they do that and he didn't say anything but he was just thinking and brother branham looked over at dawson said they're not as far off as you think and dawson said i thought that was pretty far off because it was a son of man revealing the son of man the son of man was there and the son of man was working in that flesh elohim was coming into that flesh and discerning the thoughts of people's minds but that flesh was not elohim brother branham says it's a razor's edge between what's true and what's wrong he said they're baptizing in my name and boy that's horrible and he says they're not as far off as you think dawson because it was a son of man revealing the son of man jesus christ was displaying himself in that tabernacle he was showing his nature his attributes he was lining the word up and showing what it looked like what what the word looked like when it was displayed in sin born flesh see i said something sunday i'd like to repeat god did not send down the message in books and just flutter down from heaven all the books because if he would flutter down all the books from heaven we would just be arguing about this and that but what god did is he took the message and he put it on display in a human being so that we could take what's on the book and line it up to the lies and that these things must line up and so how can i say i have the correct doctrine of the message and i hate my brother and i'm antagonistic and i'm nasty in the pulpit and sarcastic and cutting everybody else down and calling them names and when the example of that doctrine interpreted never did those things so how can i do those things and say i believe the correct doctrine when the one who who received the correct teaching never did those things so it gives us a great opportunity to check what we believe with a living example a living example we have testimonies we have recorded sermons we have his own testimony we've got other books a man sent from god 20th century prophet a prophet visits south africa we have all kinds of examples amen all kinds of books that were written tapes that we can listen to recorded testimonies to show us this man's life and they all line up to paint the same picture and i want to believe a message amen that has the same spirit that was in that man that brought him to that life i want that same word and that same spirit to bring my life to match that life and i'm not saying i want to i don't i don't want to have to repeat all the works that he did i'm not called to be a prophet that's not my office but i want that character i want that nature i want that life inside of me so the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature and his being in the message it is the rising of the sun brother man says as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days waving of the sheep what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat so the per first part of the field the the bride field that came to full harvest maturity there was a maturing of the word and as it matured it matured in a vessel amen and that word was lifted up and weighed before us what was the wave sheath it was the first one to prove that it was wheat how do you prove that you're wheat brother branham said you don't yeah he told us you don't do it in the shuck phase the tassel phase the blade face but it's got to come back to wheat to reflect the original wheat that went in the ground so whatever life went into the ground amen jesus christ when the seed went in has to be the same seed at the end so there had to be a wave sheep that was waved over the people the first one that proved it was wheat what wheat the same wheat that went in the ground the life of jesus christ this way she was the first one to prove it was wheat not barley not oats but wheat and i want to ask you did his life prove that he was wheat did the process bring him to full harvest maturity did you see the life of jesus christ on display you realize that that did not happen for his benefit that happened for our benefit god did that for us friends oh praise be to god he goes on to say the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there so god waved this message amen how did he wave the message the message and the messenger are the one in the same thing what was his message the seventh seal what life did he display the seventh seal it was christ in bride form was being waived over you and i what does it look like when christ is in bright form look at that prophet that's what it looks like what is my goal what is my objective what is this message pointing to it's pointing to what is this message for amen is to bring cre to being christ in bright form what does it look like when jesus christ is in the formation of the bride it looks like that prophet right there he was the first one to prove that he was we showing that the process that brought this one that we will bring the entire harvest to wheat of wheat to maturity so whatever worked for him and then what brother branham say he said you know what we have to do now there's nothing wrong with the message but we just got to lay in the presence of the sun to bake all of the greenness out so that we can come to the same so what was sent this message was the light and brother benham said hot august light amen it was to bake all of the greenness out of us so this message that came to us was to bring us the full harvest maturity and full harvest maturity will look like that wave sheath [Music] and so you know i'm ashamed to admit to you there's still some greenness left in chad how do you know brother chad because i'm looking at the wave sheath [Music] and when i look at the wave sheath i can't say well i'm all ready when i look at the wave sheath i said oh i need to lay in the presence of this message i need to lay in this sun this light this illumination amen this presence of jesus christ at the return of his word i need that to continue to bake all the immaturity out of me so i can come into that same image now remember don't get confused in your mind when we say same image it's not same office and all the same works amen you don't have to raise the dead and open the blind of the eyes that will happen in the body of christ absolutely but it doesn't mean you have to repeat what the prophet did it's the life it's the nature amen it's the very life of christ coming through your life and it doesn't matter if there's ever a manifestation of a supernatural power that other people can look and say she raised dead sheep and blind eyes but it's the life that's laying there and if the life is there it can raise dead and open blind eyes it can do whatever the life wants to do but we want that life in the smyrnan church age out of the church age book brother bram said in every age every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it now listen brother bram said something a little different this time he didn't say took it and believed it believed it accepted it he said they took it and they lived that messenger's message in the message the invisible union brother bam says the anointed word of god being vindicated before any man that's born to be a son of god with the predestinated germ into him for this hour he'll see god's message as sure as there's a god in heaven martin luther saw it for his wesley salt for his the pentecostal sought for his now what about you see they went into a denomination here's the word condemning it telling you what we are to have today and just exactly malachi 4 and all these other promises for the hour what do you see what are you looking at amen here we are the real genuine eagles here my sheep know my voice the stranger they'll not follow why it was put in there by predestination you were foreordained to be a son of god you were in god before the foundation of the world you're only manifested in this day for his honor and glory how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of god yes sir which you are a part of that word by predestination because look god is the word you believe it he always was the word in the beginning was the word and if the word was god then you were in god the word the part that you're to play was in god before the foundation of the world he seen you he knew you he predestinated you to it so the seventh angel was the messenger of the seventh seal i hope we have this and the messenger in his message is one and the same see sometimes i get cautious about the way i word things because i don't want people to take what i'm saying and run in a different direction with it but i i hope you're catching my heart my intent and what i'm saying but people have been looking for years into the message books to try to find the seventh seal when the seventh seal has been on display the whole time that's why brother branham when he's preaching the seals he goes through seals and seal one information seal two information steal three seal four seal five still six it's all information information information but when you get to seal seven there's no information he says there's silence nothing's said there's not even a symbol to go on nothing's give out in this amen and brother branham said it's the coming of the lord so is the seventh seal open brother bram said it's the coming of the lord is the seventh seal open no it's not open well if it's not then we're waiting for his coming but brother branham said all seven seals are open but he said the seven seals the coming of the lord where did he come he came in secret what's the secret he came in bride form [Music] where did you see it i saw it in the wave sheaves the first part of the bride form that come to first i was maturity the first part of the church to prove that it was wheat was in the messenger the messenger amen within the messenger was the first part of the harvest to come to full harvest maturity and that was waved over the people what was it it was showing you the seventh seal christ in bride form so the bride i'm not even writing down i don't even remember what i was going to write the bride is the word what word is she right when moses moses was the word we believe that so there was a thought of god and that thought of god amen was spoken and when it was spoken it was spoken to abraham and there was a promise that the seeds have so joined in a strange land but i'll bring them out with a mighty hand and so there was there was a thought of god that became a spoken word of god but when moses came down after meeting the pillar of fire and he went down as the deliverer he was the manifested word he was the word for his day he was what was in god's mind that was spoken to abraham it was thought spoken word manifested word and in each expression it had to carry the original thought so he was the word for that day and that day's word was an exodus out of egypt you got that then joshua became the word for his day and joshua's word for his day was a crossing over jordan to take the land got that then david was the word for his day and the the david's day was to set up the kingdom that the son of david would take and rule the entire earth so it came as an example of the kingdom of man after god's own heart and then solomon became the word of his day in solomon's word he became the type the foreshadow of jesus christ coming as son of david son of god prince of peace to establish a reign in the millennium that would reign over the whole earth so he was there foreshadowing that he was playing his part for his day so solomon was that part joshua was this part david was this part amen moses was this part and what were they they were the word and when they were there acting out the word they were the word with the thought included amen so when you come to the end of the church ages there is a word that he will have a bride without spot or wrinkle he will have a bride that will be be united with him in an invisible union and she will be a reflection to the earth of who he is and what is that it's a manifestation of the seventh seal so the bride the bride is the word for her day which is the seventh seal all the other seals were expressed all the other ages have been expressed but the bride is here to express the seventh seal whatever the woman was to adam when she came out is what the bride is to express to christ in this day the bride is being restored back and she's here to express this part of the word how is she going to express this part of the word if she's still disbelieving what the prophet gave cutting some away and cutting that away but she's got to lay in the presence of the sun to bake all the greenness out because she's got to be the full expression of the full word this is not a day of partial those things of partial understanding and partial impartial the days of partial are over we've come to the day of fullness and in the day of fullness amen we've got to be the full expression of the full word of god and how are we going to do it if we're still unsure that what the prophet gave us was the full word of god we've got to lay in the presence of this son that was given us and say god bake all the greenness out of me make my mind out of me make my traditions out of me what i used to think the scripture meant what i used to think the message was make it all out of me god i gotta get it all out of me bake it out and make me exactly like you so that the life that's flowing through this body matches what you showed us in the wave see if if our doctrines are not bringing us into that manifestation it's time to revisit our doctrines [Music] if i mean if believing the message means believing brother branham was a prophet but that i can compromise on the word and still be his bride then i don't know what the message is you can see the devil is bringing great deception in our day trying to get the churches to just relax down and be comfortable believing that god's been a prophet and that i'm the bride and even nobody would say these words but we're guilty sometimes friends of believing i'm the bride god can never leave me behind i'm the bride anything i do is okay because i'm the bride now nobody you couldn't get anybody to say that with their lips but they're saying it with their actions because they're doing contrary to what the prophet taught us to do and they continued to do it contrary to what the prophet did but they believe the message and they're the bride and they would never say like brother bam said god just loves me so much he doesn't care what i do does he love the bride so much does he care what she does i ask you a question will god correct his bride that's what this word is to do is make all the greenness out of us we cannot we cannot say we believe this mess this is not a denomination this is not i you can't go to a message church and be a believer you have to be a believer it's not there's not admittance you know i walk into the doors of a message church and i'm a believer and i believe god sent a prophet i mean there's multitudes that believe god sent a prophet amen but that's not really the goal of the message that's not what god wanted god wanted a people that would come to the full life of jesus christ in bride form that it would be christ in bride form manifesting himself to the entire world that was the purpose of the message that's the seventh seal that's why brother branham opened the seals that's why god sent a prophet that's why the supernatural that's why there's a cloud that's why all the stuff that happened happened that's why there was raising of dead that's why there was opening of blinding eyes everything that happened happened for this purpose to get a bride to full maturity and it takes a full word the full light to bring her to full maturity to express the full life and that's the purpose of the message [Music] to stop somewhere short and say i believe god sent a prophet i go to a message church but you know i'm not so sure about brother benham said about this and i'm not so sure about that and i think i've got a right to remarry and i think it's okay for me to wear this and i you see really quickly that the devil has got in somewhere and a temptation in the wilderness because now we're hanging out over here my want my desire what i like the way i want to look the way i want to live and we we we've rejected the very message well we haven't rejected the message i believe god said no no no no you haven't taken the authority of a prophet in your life the voice that god gave us in this day to bring the bride to full rapture of faith to full harvest maturity [Music] and then somehow we get comfortable in compromise because i'm the bride i believe the message i'm the bride if you're comfortable and comfortable if you're comfortable living contrary to what the prophet of god taught us to live then i would go back and repent and say god there's something wrong with i've accepted a lie somewhere [Music] amen i've accepted something the devil has whispered to me somewhere he's used something to get me to stop in my growth to be coming to this perfect image of a bride and i've gotten comfortable being in the message and being part of the bride but never to be comfortable being in the message the message has to be in you amen and furthermore the message has to come out of you you you and i are called to be the living message the living expression of the living word everything brother branham preached is supposed to be alive and you and i and manifested and demonstrated i say god bake the greenness out of me take this word and bake the greenness out of me and help lord help help me to line up to that life i love the fact that the prophet of god was honest with us i love the fact that he told his mistakes and he told us right and he told his wrongs and he told us repent and he told all all of that because what he did is he set an example for you and i that we can walk this path god can correct us we can repent you can be bride and get something wrong but god will bring it to your repentance and you can repent and he showed us how to repent he showed us how to come back in line with the word he showed us that a prophet of god can step to the side with his own desire but god can spank him and bring him right back in line with the word and he can repent and even confess it to the entire church why so you and i would have confidence to say no matter what god by the word can correct me and bring me back in line because god wants me to manifest this life god doesn't want me to stop somewhere along the way and get comfortable in my condition i want to grow all the way into the full manifestation of jesus christ i want to i don't want to stop with pretty good i don't want to stop with i gotta no i i want to reflect that same life that prophet reflected and until that happens i'm not content praise god i want to read just one more quote he said things that are to be now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of god is because you have to be have to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that was god there to be a son of god you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule why because you're a thought so what are you supposed to be today a thought expressed [Music] so you can wake up every morning now and say what am i supposed to be today i am supposed to be a thought expressed that changes things doesn't i'm not a person who goes to this church and i'm not one who's born in that no i am supposed to be a thought of god expressed expressed as a mother expressed as a father expressed as a as a teenager expressed as an older person expressed as a single express as a married couple expressed as a mechanic express what am i supposed to be i'm supposed to be a thought of god expressed today the genie of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or daughter of god therefore you get what i mean see you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water the word fell on you it was expressed in a being that means that thought that god had was his attribute to see gene and it fell into the earth and was enshrouded in dirt and that was you amen but when the water of the washing and the water word fell it became the thought became an expressed being and so now what are you you are supposed to be the manifestation of the thought of god [Music] i don't think there's any room for slowing down stopping progress taking a break stepping off to the side being content i think what god wants what god saw for me is what i want for me i can't produce it in my life i can't make it happen but by the grace of god he's predestinated me to fulfill a certain role but what does he need for me he needs me to surrender he needs me to yield to surrender to recognize his mechanism for bringing me into harvest maturity which is this word and he needs me to submit to it he's not going he's not going to take us mold us all up and make no he's looking for somebody who will surrender themselves to him and then he'll take and bring us up and grow us in what we're supposed to be i said lord let me reflect that galatians 4 19 my little children of whom i travail in birth until christ be formed in you did brother branham show us what god was like we can all stand musicians shouldn't come did you when you saw that man did you see christ that was the goal friends that's our example and if the revelation that he had would bring him into that position if it would work for one son of god it'll work for all sons of god and we have to have confidence in this message that god gives us that if i will lay in the presence of the son and i will feed on this message this message will bring me to that life i can't do it by myself but the spirit of god will anoint the word inside of me and bring to manifestation the full word of god i have to trust it i have to trust that it will i have to stay in it and let it work it's wonderful work in my life god bless you friends let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you father for this word that you've given us i thank you god that you've given us an example lord that we can see you gave us your word you gave us the perfect interpretation of the word but you brought it lord through somebody that was born in sin like i was you bought it through somebody who had hardships and trials and failures just like me so i can look to what you did there and have confidence that what you did there you'll do inside of me god this message has been on display before it's on display now it'll be on display in the future i say lord help me delay in your presence and bake all the greenness out of me lord help me father to stay with this word and stay true to this word god forgive me for my my selfishness lord my self-desire god but help me just to stay true to the calling you've called me to for god i'm so thankful for that life that i saw i'm thankful for 1200 tapes i'm thankful for testimonies of saints i'm thankful for the books that were written i'm thankful for what you gave me lord god i just can't express my gratitude enough that i have seen the example of what was preached so i would know how to understand what was preached you showed us what your goal is in this day you've told us what your target is lord you've aimed us for that target and i prayed lord that by your spirit you would make each one of us hit that target god we just yield ourselves to you a fresh lord god we want to yield every day lord wash us by the washing of the water of the word wash our minds lord wash our human spirits wash us more to help us to walk in the way you've ordained and to be what you've called us to be in this day for god i believe with all my heart that we were in your thinking before the foundation of the world and you saw this day and you've portioned this portion of the word for an expression in this day and i say god help us to manifest that we love you for this message help us to stay true to it lord god i pray that you would put that little alarm bell in us that if anybody would bring a deviation off the word that you would ring that little bell on us so that we would know not to go that way that we could follow after the example that you've given us god i pray you bless your people and keep us lord as we go home help us god every day of our lives in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless [Music] completely to you [Music] make it all brand
