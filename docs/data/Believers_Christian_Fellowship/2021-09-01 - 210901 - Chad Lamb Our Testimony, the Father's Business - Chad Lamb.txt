glorified in the service this evening we pray in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelation revelation chapter 21 at the end of service we're going to have a baptism this evening so praise god uh peter brooks desires to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so we're excited for him and for his family and for brother bob because brother bob is grandpa has the honors of doing the baptism so it's a special privilege for him and so we're excited for the whole family so it'll be right after the service also want to let you know that the fellowship hall is now open so this sunday for the communion service if you'd like to do like we've done in the past if you want to go out and get a lunch and bring it back or you want to pack a lunch for your family and bring it the fellowship hall will be open and the tables will be open in there and feel free to use that kitchen's not completely done yet but the fellowship hall is open and we can use that for communion so may the lord bless us next week or sunday in that let's look at revelation 21 verse 6 as we begin 21-6 i'm going to read verse 6-7 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning in the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son remember the lord adds blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats we read this verse from sunday and i want to continue just a little bit with that thought and move on from there but we know that he that overcometh shall inherit all things and the prophet of god told us overcoming is not when when everything is done for us and when god pushes us into a tube and pulls us out the other side and he did it all we say we overcome you didn't overcome there was nothing to overcome but yet there's things in life obstacles and life and situations and we have free choice and god wants us to choose his word and in choosing the word we're overcoming amen and if we're overcoming in the age that we live in by the word then we get the reward of the overcomers amen and so we talked about that through the church ages in revelation uh chapters two and three all the reward to the overcomer and each age are available to us if we'll overcome in our age so let's look at the revelation chapter 12. we're going to read another portion of scripture in revelation 12 and verse 7. and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and we know that the the scene takes place at the rapture of the bride when the bride goes up satan comes down and he incarnates as superman and then becomes the beast so we know the transition that's taking place here and it's important to know as we move on in the scriptures and in verse 10 it says i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused him before our god day and night and they overcame him who is they the brethren amen the ones that he was accusing they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony amen if you're going to be an overcomer there's something that you get to do as part of the overcoming amen the blood of the lamb was shed for you you had nothing to do with that amen that was done in god's mind before the foundation of the world it was manifest 2 000 years ago on calvary and the blood of the lamb was shed for you on your behalf for your redemption amen but they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and amen and the word of their testimony amen and if we want the promise that comes to the overcomer amen then we must recognize the blood that was shed for us god did that for us amen that was the lamb of god the son of god that shed his own blood for us for our redemption that was done for us now what do i do amen we must overcome by the blood of lamb and the word of my testimony and the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death they were willing to surrender all death to self a complete surrender no more me but all of him verse 12 therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe unto the inhabiters of the earth and the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time i'd like to take out of this portion of scripture for a title for a text our testimony and then also the father's business we're going to get to that later our testimony and then the father's business this word testimony that we read here in verse 11 they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony this word testimony it comes from a root word that we'll get to in a few minutes but it means a testifying the office committed to the prophets of testifying concerning future events and also one who testifies testimony before a judge so this testimony is not just saying you know god is good and and and you know he created all things and everything's wonderful but it's actually a witness amen giving a witness as before a judge or testify that your testimony now is standing in judgment amen so they overcame him not just by whimsical uh uh uh um uh saying good positive things but they actually were giving a testimony before a judgment seat and they were testifying of the word and they were overcoming by the blood of the lamb and by their testimony so you know i think the the devil was being judged by the testimony of these witnesses let's go to the book of acts i want to pick up this root word here in acts chapter 1. this word testimony in chapter 11 comes from a root word which we're going to read here in acts chapter 1 and it'll help us get the meaning of this acts chapter 1 and verse 6. acts chapter 1 and verse 6. when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his power but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses there it is this is the root word that testimony their testimony is taken from you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all judea and in samaria and in the uttermost parts of the earth so christ is telling them you're going to receive power when the holy ghost has come upon you and what was the ending of power supposed to do the undoing of power was to turn them into witnesses for him that's what the power of the indwelling of the holy ghost does amen it makes you a witness of the life of jesus christ it makes you a witness of the revelation of the word for your day and now you can overcome by your testimony amen because now you're witnessing of his life because his life now is in you so he said you shall be witnesses this word witnesses in the greek it means a witness simply a witness and a legal sense or historical sense somebody that is a witness to something and so the christ was going to give the power shall come upon you amen when when the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power that you can be these witnesses so how do they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony let's go to hebrews chapter 3 there's a principle that the prophet of god lays down that i just want to touch on as we move through these scriptures hebrews chapter 3 verse 1. hebrews chapter 3 verse 1 wherefore holy brother and partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus that word profession means confession and he's the high priest of our confession or our profession let's look over at chapter 4 verse 14. in hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession here's what the prophet says about these scriptures he says now remember every redemptive blessing has already been purchased the price is paid there there's only one way that you'll ever be able to receive it is to believe it and accept it he's the high priest of our confession the hebrew says here the hebrew letter says he's the high priest of our profession to profess and confess is the same thing of course he's the high priest of our confession therefore we cannot do anything for us until first we confess that he has done it and then when we confess it then he is the high priest and mediator to go to work on that and make it right so we pray trusting in god tonight in his kindness and mercy that he will give to us his abundance of grace tonight and now remember you must accept it the book of proverbs verse 18 i'm going to quote the scripture to proverbs 18 21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof so there's there's something that god is asking us to do to be a witness and witness in word and witness in life to give a true witness and a true testimony in the day and age in which we live and it's part of our overcoming amen and part of this overcoming of the brethren is the very thing that caused the casting down of satan out of heaven into the earth it is because there's a people amen who will overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony but we have a high priest amen he's a high priest uh uh they'll be faithful to our profession and that means brother branham says it this way let's let me pick it up here in this other quote he says and then they go testifying making their testimony ring out and you can be the high priest and you can be the high priest brother is praying and you are the high priest of their profession now when they can truly from their heart believe that you have did the work we know as far as the work itself is already finished but to appropriate faith to believe all things are possible to them believe he also says in the message perseverance notice now when jesus was here on earth he made the sacrifice for healing and for salvation do you believe that jesus could not come tonight and save you he has already done it the sin question was settled he is the lamb of god that took away the sins of the world he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed it is past tense no matter how much you would scream out and how much you would could scream out that wouldn't do a bit of good until you accept him and he is the high priest sitting at the right hand of majesty on high to make intercession in our profession you've got to accept it and profess it that's correct same way by healing so he's the high priest of our profession but if we have no testimony no profession there's nothing for him to go to work on and bring to pass in our lives so if they overcome him by by by the blood of the lamb in the word of their testimony there has to be a testimony coming forth amen that is bringing christ on the scene to empower that testimony to bring it past and if there's a testimony that'll be you know the final voice in the final age and the final part of the gentile bride she has to have a word of testimony that'll bring him down amen there has to be a power amen given to her to be a witness of the word that's given to us in this day not repeating from previous ages the previous ages had the word for their day amen that would give them the power to overcome in that day amen but the the word has been growing and been growing and growing and it's growing until there'll be a people on the earth that have a testimony that'll be the final overcoming of that devil amen but it's not going to be secret believers who hide out secretly and say i believe in all that and it's not going to be repeating what worked in previous dispensations in previous church ages amen because that had victory in that day but yet he's still there as the accuser of the brethren so there has to be a climbing of this testimony a climbing of this witnessing of the word until it climbs and it climbs and it climbs and christ is there constantly as the high priest of the profession of the believers bringing it to pass bringing it to pass bringing it to pass amen and now we know why in this end time he sent a prophet of god to restore the word to us because it's going to take a full measure of the revelation of the word to bring a full victory in this day it's not the day of partial partial word didn't bring the full victory but the day of the full word amen there's be a people on the earth that will believe that word and the fullness of its power and they will express it in life they will express it in word they will express it in action they will be a there'll be a true testimony of the word in this day and he'll be the high priest of their profession and it will have the attendant effect for they will overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony let's go to romans chapter 10. romans chapter 10 verse 8. but what saith that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth in the righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation if you look at this scripture the apostle paul was actually speaking of two sides of salvation first a man must believe in his heart but he must confess with his mouth the believing in your heart that is a gift from god by grace are we saved through faith and that is a gift of god not of ourselves it is a gift of god so the ability to believe the word is a gift of god amen so the fact that we can believe the word is a gift of god but paul doesn't leave it there amen there was two parts to what paul was saying that man shall believeth amen but he shall speaketh let's read it again that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved so it's not just speaking without actual faith in the heart that won't get anywhere but saying i believe in my heart with no positive confession that doesn't get anywhere either but when the heart and the confession match amen paul is saying that's salvation amen verse 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made into salvation this goes right to revelation that we read they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony there has to be a witness that's been empowered by the holy ghost not empowered by the holy ghost just for selfish reasons and and for whatever purposes we want and but for to be a witness that's why this power has come because it's in this testimony that lucifer is going to lose his position the devil's going to be cast down let's go to revelation chapter 10 now because the question is what are we going to witness you're going to witness what everything's been witnessed before what helped lucifer or what helped luther overcome and what helped wesley overcome and well the pentecost was overcome yeah that's part of that but there's more there's building up into the full measure of christ and to the headship of christ amen and victory keeps growing and growing and growing as the word grows until we come to complete victory revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished that he hath declared to his servants the prophets this scripture scripture's so important to us because it's the day and age we live in the seventh angel has come amen the prophet of god has come and the mystery of god has been finished amen and there's been the opening of the of the seven seals the seven thunders have sounded and the mystery that is laying in the whole book has has been revealed but god doesn't leave it there that wasn't the ending amen of of of of god's work here in revelation chapter 10 because we go to revelation chapter 8. it says in the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey so we we all know that john is the type of the bride and now this mighty angel is christ and he's come down with an open book and he's thundered out seven thunders he roars as a lion roars and seven thunder sounded their voices and john was told to write it not don't write that but seal it up to the time of the end so at the end time whatever those sons the seven thunders uttered has to be revealed at the end time and as it's revealed amen it's unlocking the mystery of the bible and as it unlocks the mystery of the bible it is unlocking the revelation that was laying under the seals the revelation that that contained the entire bible which is the mystery of god and the mystery of god was laying under those seals amen and christ comes with an open book in his hand and he roars and seven thunder's utter but there's going to come a time when there's a seventh angel on the earth and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god shall be finished amen there'll be the revelation of the seven thunders amen and after the revelation of the seven thunders go in the seventh angels ministry amen then there's going to be an opportunity for john the bride to go to that angel christ and say give me that book amen the open book not the closed book not the not not the one that's been sealed away amen for seven church ages not the one that's been lost under creeds and dogmas of man but the one that's been restored back and opened up and the seals peeled off give me that book amen now that it's open it's open to do what it's open to reveal the mystery of god not just a bunch of details not a bunch of facts and figures but that book opened to reveal the mystery of god what was this mystery through the whole bible what was it all about what was god's plan why did god do everything he did in creation why did he make things the way he did why the fall why the trees why why everything that's the mystery laying underneath the seals the open book contains the mystery of god and now in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he sounds the mystery of god's complete now there's instructions that are given to the bride now you go to that christ the angel of the covenant christ and john goes to him says give me the book he says take it and eat it up take it and devour it take it and become one with it take it into your person feed on it become one with it take it inside of you amen don't hold it don't show it to others don't use it as something to brag about amen don't say i got the book i got the book amen take it inside of you amen feed on it and become one with the book amen and as you feed on it it'll be sweet as the revelations are coming it is sweet amen but when you go to testify when you go to live amen what this book is revealed then you're going to find rejection and you're going to find difficulty and you're going to find all kinds of horrible things it's going to be bitter in your belly as you digest this revelation and as this revelation becomes your life verse 10 and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and if this people will faithfully take the open book and feed on the open book and become one with the open book and then go to prophesy again before many nations and kings and tongues and peoples amen they are going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony amen this this very act amen revelations 10 amen has produced amen has brought to us the open book and given us access to the title deed of all redemption and he's brought it back to us through a prophetic ministry and he's brought the truth of the whole bible back to a people so that the people can take that into themselves and become one with this revelation one with god to do what to testify again to declare the truth to speak it out to speak it in every nation in every tongue to every candidate to speak it before kings to speak it before all why because they will overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony you realize we're not we're not feeding on reheated doctrine from previous church ages that doctrine gave victory in that day but that day is not this day and as everything grows amen christ is is growing and the body is growing into the head which is christ but as as christ is growing the kingdom of satan is growing and deception is growing amen and so there's got to be a word to overcome amen and as everything's growing you can't rely on the word that worked before because the kingdom of satan is growing you need a word here so god through a prophet in this day has brought us a capstone word and made sure that there can be a final victory man so that she can be the final voice in the final age so there can be a final testimony which will bring a final victory and the satan will be cast down but the only way satan's going to be cast down is if they overcome him that what the scripture says they overcome him that means if the bride is not faithful to revelation chapter 10 verse 8 to 11 then his position stays secure amen but this word came amen to to disrupt amen to remove amen to to cast down the accuser of the brethren because he's accusing the brethren because because the word was obscured and and and churches and creeds and denominations have taken the word of god and diced it into a thousand pieces and made parts of it obscure and reinterpreted and retranslated and changed the word until the people don't even know what the truth is anymore and he's sitting there as accuser of the brethren saying they're off the word there and they're off the word there and they're off to word there and you must judge it here you must judge it there and you must judge it here so god in his day he said i'm going to take the seals off and i'm going to show the whole thing what's been going on through these church ages what happened amen through the dark ages what the reformation's been all about because i want my people to know the truth because the truth shall make you free so god has brought a truth and that truth will make us free amen that that true testimony will cast down the accuser of the brethren that's why we have to keep moving into this revelation feeding on this book speaking this word keeping it pure bringing it giving it the way it was brought to us and because this is our victory amen our victory is not having a bigger church or a nice meeting or are more dynamic this or more powerful this or are great big programs that's what the denominations did and it's failed we're not here to have a better sunday school we're not here to have a better church we're not here to have a better program we're here to keep this testimony pure because it's the testimony in conjunction with the blood of the lamb that gives us victory [Music] and the devil's always trying to distract us with something else but it's the word that's been restored it's the revelation of the word in this hour that is giving us the victory that's what we should be testifying that's what we should be feeding on that's what we should be thinking about talking about amen driving into praying for more revelation praise god we get so lazy the laodicean spirit is so lazy so self-serving so interested in pleasures and easy living and under that laodicean spirit we forget the tremendous commission that we have as the bride of jesus christ and we get content with good jobs and good homes and comfortable seats at church gifts in the body and good song leaders and nice musicians and and we get content in those things and we forget that those things are on the peripheral those are side effects of the word but it's the word that gives us victory amen it's the testimony of this word it's the revelation of this hour it's what's been unlocked at the opening of the seals that is going to give us victory amen god did not send a prophet in this day so that we could have a better church than they had before or that we could finally get all the doctrines corrected that's part of it but that's it's not just for a correcting of doctrine a man is to bring the revelation that was under those seals the the mystery that's being revealed to the bride so that she can testify and be a true witness and her witness will bring down the enemy we want to use all kinds of things to defeat the devil try to use our willpower try to use all kinds of mechanisms we get loud and we do this and we we say things and so brash and and make threats to the devil he doesn't move at your threat he doesn't move at your noise that's what the prophet of god told us he doesn't move because you say i'm making you move what defeats him is the word what came in this hour was the revelation of the word the revelation of the mystery that's been in the entire bible from genesis of revelation the thought that was in god's mind the one thing he wanted to achieve all through the bible that is what's been given to the bride in this day for victory we're not to get distracted by anything else but stay focused on that amen dive into it ingest it love it pray for more revelation on it because that's the victory prophet of god singing a song in 1965 at the end of the message god's only provided place of worship he's singing a song and while he's singing singing some bright day i'll go and see him some bright day i'll go and see him on the other shore oh what oh won't that be a happy meeting word goes to word he's injecting a thought now into the song won't that word goes to word he's talking about this happy meeting on the other side and he's starting to say the word is going to the word the word in you and the revealed word of the day is coming together god the word and the portion of the word that's alive in you has been quickened by the baptism holy ghost word is coming to word he's singing in time won't that word goes to word meeting he's he's keeping up he says when the bride goes up word by word amen what's causing her to rise revelation upon revelation word by word she's rising up above the carnal things he goes on singing happy meaning on the other shore oh that bright day may be tomorrow and when he gets done he says you say you mean that brother branham what's he referring to the words he injected there you mean that brother branham yes sir when the lutheran of that age the wesleyans of their age the pentecostals of their age the true ones not the denominationals the pentecostals the one that added leaven their denomination they died but this true word moving on see just like jesus said at that day you you will you'll know that i am in the father the father in me i and you and you and me it's all the word they start saying oh won't that be a happy meeting when his sons are gathered to his gate the word going to the word the bride going up word by word she's been going up amen through the through the feet and legs through luther amen through the reformation up through the hand what she's been doing she's been coming up word by word amen do you think that'll stop now no she's still going up word by word the revelation of this mystery as it unfolds and gets deeper and richer and more clear amen what's it doing it's taking leo to see us hold and moving it away amen it's taking carnality and it's laying it down and bringing us into a spiritual reality that's all around us it's moving us from dimensions we're in a time of dimensional overlap while most of the world is waiting for the rapture we're in the rapture because the rapture started with a shout amen the lord himself shall descend with a shout what's that a message to gather the people have you been gathered under a message amen then you're part of the shout you've been gathered in the shout you're part of the voice testifying this word the world's waiting for a rapture you're in one you're walking at it they're waiting for a resurrection you've been resurrected out of dead denominationalism you've been caught up on high to meet your lord in the air when you heard this word you rose up to meet it but my body's still here i don't care where my body is if i can keep going there my body's going to eventually have to catch up we're in a dimensional overlap you can look at time as a meat cleaver then i'm going to stay on this side until i know that this junctions came and then i'll move to this side of rapture and resurrection and translation i tell you you'll never make it amen because one age blends into another age and there's a dimensional overlap taking place and you should be moving word by word out of this dimension into the next dimension your walk should be changing your prayer life should be changing your mind should be changing word by word revelation by revelation as we eat the book and testify the accuser of the brethren should be losing ground amen and you should be gaining ground we're not here to wait for god to pull the lever he said they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony so what am i sitting around waiting for he's waiting on you is what the prophet of god said to take what he's given us it's here it's available to take it and eat it up amen and testify prophesy again he says and god's only provided place of worship now think these men why was they called and was put in this condition these pharisees by jesus said in vain you worship me worship him genuine worship true worship from their hearts in vain you worship me why teaching for doctrine the tradition of man therefore you make the commandments of god of no effect to the people if i taught you a methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bride time if moses taught the message of noah it would have taken no effect if jesus taught moses message it would take no effect because the predestination predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's give for that seed it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows it we can't grow under methodist doctrine pentecostal doctrine lutheran doctrine you name it doctrine any man-made doctrine amen this seed was not meant to grow under man-made doctrine amen amen this seed wasn't made to grow under anything that's been manhandled but the seed of god that's in you was made to spring to life and grow under the unadulterated pure virgin word of god that's been restored back to the church in this day it is the only thing that that's the only condition that it'll grow in amen so why don't we stay in the word so we can grow why don't we keep preaching the word so others can grow in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said hebrews 11 said they could not be perfect without us hands and feet cannot be perfect without the brains the knowledge the head and so forth so you realize that god has been building his body the body of his of his bride the bride of jesus christ he's been growing her up for the last 2000 years and he's growing her into the head let's look at this in ephesians ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ what he's doing he's using the gifts that he sent down and he's ministering through those gifts to build his body and bring it into the full stature of the measure of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ so god when he ascended on high he sent gifts unto men and he's been ministering through those gifts through seven church ages and what has he been doing through seven church ages he's been building a body into the perfect image of christ he's been bringing a body to the head to grow into the head and in birth pains he says the word must deliver the word bride church the word must deliver the word bride church how will a word bright church be delivered by the word if i want to bring birth amen if i want to birth a word bride it depends on what you want to birth and how you'll birth it amen but if you want to birth a word bride you can only birth the word bride by the word so so the word must deliver the word bride church the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for christ them that fell asleep in all ages will make up that bride that come out on the word that they come out on like your feet come to your head she gets greater and more you have to have and so forth so he's saying as this bride's been formed and this bride's been birthed she's been coming out of the church amen and growing in the reformation and as she comes out she's got to grow more from the feet to the arms to the head and he says she's got to get greater and more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so does the body of christ grow up and then finally the head will come to it the head of it now if we notice because it's all linked to the head the head does the turning the pulling so he has he says as this body grows the head will come to it he says in feast of the trumpets he says there was three stages of it as i said the martyr's age age of the martyr for it then the stage of the ref reformers and the reformers age went all the way through the pentecostal age and now the calling out this isn't the reformer's age now is the calling out time come out of all of it my people now is the calling out time when finished at laodicean age according to revelation 10 the mystery of all the bible would be known to the bride is that right revelation 10 bride called out by the word christ himself calling out the bride brother branham wasn't calling out the bride christ himself was calling out the bride the headship was coming to the body and the headship was the word and that word was calling out his bride it was christ calling out the bride he says let me read that again he says now revelation 10 listen close now bride called out by the word christ himself calling out the bride making plain hebrews 13 8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever does the same is the same and christ is the mystery of god revealed says now we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship going in he stops says coming in his bride where is that where's the true headship at christ the true hedgehog he's coming in his bride amen it's the bride coming of christ christ the true headship coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at first in john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life vindicated by god himself through his promised word for the last day he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you'll catch it let's go to galatians chapter 4. verse 19. my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you here's the apostle paul and he's in labor he's in labor pains and what's he trying to do he's trying to bring forth the church and that will he says i'm laboring and travailing birth again until christ be formed in you what was the goal of paul's ministry to christ be formed in you paul as he laid the foundation amen he was the wise master builder he laid a foundation and he says take heed how you build thereon and the chief cornerstone is jesus christ and paul as the master builder he laid the foundation and what foundation did he lay he laid the foundation as he's laboring to lay the foundation what's the purpose that christ be formed in you amen whatever this building of the church he's building is to be a habitation of christ christ formed in it that was the goal from the very beginning in the invisible union the prophet says you remember when it went down and the grain began to ripen that you find before the grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead the grain is going to be the original word come back to manifestation but it's been carried through the church ages through the stalk and the torso and the shock but when it comes time for manifestation everything else has to be dead nothing else will bring the victory nothing else will bring the right testimony that has satan cast down when we come to the end time nothing else will work what worked previously the life has left it now and is in the grain if it worked there it's still here this is no rejection of previous truths all the previous truths in that life moved forward and is now in the seed everything in the stalk has to be dead hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus and the bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to the head here and all that life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the rapture it's got to come to the head for the rapture amen it's got to come to the full measure of the word and this is what he says here in the first seal it says now there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through these seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith what's going to do it the revelation of those seven thunders amen is going to get the bride together for rapturing faith because we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it so what he's saying what we've collected everything that we build up through as the body's building up through the reformers age through everything else if there's something else that's got to take place to bring this rapturing faith amen and brother branham's coming to the first seal he's coming to the to the opening now the revealing of the thunders and he's saying what we got now won't work so you take what you had before the seals just hang with me the ministry the tying together of loose ends brother branham says what we got now won't work that's why brother brennan's ministry even his ministry all the way up it was building it was building a plan where he's laying down truth tying together loose ends restoring truth restoring doctrine bringing us all the way up to this point but he says what we have now is not enough so that's why as the bride of jesus christ we have got to make the transition in 1963 if we're going to go to rapturing faith if we're going to have the testimony the word the prophesying again that's going to bring down satan's stronghold in heaven that's going to cast him down his accuser of the brethren we got to make the transition from 62 to 63. is that what he said because what we've got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out of this earth we find that after a while the lord willing find where it's written and questions and answers on the seals between the sixth and seventh seal he gets a question he says have the seven thunders which equal the seven mysteries all already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but yet but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet but the man says no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about what was the thunder's about the thunder was the thunder of god the voice of god amen threw a prophet to reveal what those seals were what the mysteries behind the symbols were and now he's coming and he's telling us no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about it was revealed the seven thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to ride in but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is the messenger of the seventh church age and brother branham says we've got to go farther amen where we're at when he comes to the seals we've got to go farther what we've got now wouldn't do it if we're going to go to a rapture we've got to go all the way to the head amen we've got the head to have to come into the bride the bride has to unite with the head what is the head it is the word amen the understanding the revelation of the mystery of god that lays under those seals he's got to preach the thunder and when he preaches the thunder he unlocks the mystery of the church and when he unlocks the mystery of the church he can now unlock the mystery of god because until you unlock the mystery of the bride form of christ you cannot unlock the full revelation of god because god is known in male and female god is known in husband and wife amen christ is the mystery of god revealed but christ is revealed as mister and misses so the revelation of the seven thunders have to unlock the mystery of the church through seven church ages amen through two thousand years of mystery of redemption of the gentile woman and when he unlocks that mystery laying under that is the mystery of the whole book and that's what we need for rapturing faith that's what we need to be testifying of that's what we need to be prophesying again [Music] if we've missed that we've missed the very thing that's giving us the victory in the end time he says in the first seal again he's but think now he wrote this but when he started to write those other seven thunders he said don't write it he'd been commissioned to write everything he'd seen but when these seven thunders over in revelation 10 under he said don't write them at all they're mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away i say his opinion was right he was in the first seal he was in the midst of doing it and when it do it'll give faith for the rapturing grace for the church to move out it means my move out listen when brother branham is talking about this he's talking about move out move out of the shock move out of the denominations move out of the man-made this will give them faith to move out which what is the moving out the moving out is the first part of the rapture coming out of dead denominationalism and gathering together through the headship of christ that is the first part of the rapture that's why under the seals the thunders had to go to give rapturing faith and rapturing faith would give them the faith to move out of the shock to move away from the man-made systems and move away from denominations and traditions of the fathers and what are they doing they're moving into the shout amen to moving to become the voice it's the first part of the rapture it's giving rapturing faith now they mean if you've had faith to move by the shout out of denominations and away from the shock and being gathered to the headship and become one with jesus christ and become the voice amen of christ in you you're already moving in the rapture you've received rapturing faith to begin a rapturing cycle we say we want to wait for something else to wait for something else brother graham said this is it this is the something else the revelation that's in those seven thunders is there something else in the revelation of the entire bible laying under those seven thunders is the rest of it it is the mechanism it is what gives you faith to move out what else are we waiting for another prophet another great man with another great revelation somebody else to he's already given it to his friends we have to take what the prophet said and believe it and let the revelation of those seven thunders which pealed open the seven seals which revealed the mystery of god let it give you rapturing faith to move with a shout and be gathered together to the message of the hour become one with christ get caught up to meet him outside of laodicea get caught up to meet him in the air and be seated with him in heavenly places he says in the message the rising of the sun so there he spoke to me said the seven seals will be open the seven mysteries sevenfold mysteries of the bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings hearing these mysteries marriage divorce serpency all those different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself that's opened these seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last day did you get what he said the opening of the seven mysteries revealed the opening of the seven mysteries revealed that he said open those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in christ at the beginning and how it will be revealed in the last day that's what was that was what was laying in those seven thunders the mystery of redemption and when he when he gave the mystery of redemption to the gentile church he also showed the mystery redemption for the jews and the fifth seal he showed the redemption of the earth in the sixth seal it was the mystery of redemption showing what would happen to the gentile bride and showing what would happen at the end time and he had to do that and peel the mystery off of that because underneath those seals was the mystery of the entire bible and that mystery was god becoming tangible the mystery was the becoming god mystery of the whole bible that's what gives us rapturing faith to move out to raise up out of dead denomination be resurrected out of the deadness of laodicea to hear the eagle scream and be caught up quickly to meet it in the air these are all things brother bam told us happens at the hearing of the revelation of the word that's for us colossians chapter 1 turn there together please colossians chapter 1 verse 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus where unto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily brother bam says and things that are to be said if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed creator a denomination but a living oracle of god christ in you the hope of glory a living oracle of god what is the manifestation of this hour the bride what is the bride a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god and the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living he says in modern events made clear by prophecy so now he said i'll meet them in one place the place i put my name that's in christ in jesus christ that's where god put his name that's the only place he'll meet you in his christ is the word the same yesterday it's grown from the feet the thighs and now it's in the head fixing to go manifesting in full measure the bride the same as the groom as it's fixing to go what's the manifestation as it's fixing to go it's manifesting the manifestation of the bride and we have an accuser of the brethren that has a place in the heavenly realm accusing the brethren but his his place will not remain forever prophet said when she goes up he comes down and the bible says that they overcame him who the brethren that he had been accusing they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony so now when we look at the revelation of the seven thunders revealing the seals what the church is and what she was and how god redeemed her and and the mystery of of who she was in christ from the very beginning and christ is the mystery of god revealed revealing the whole mystery now when that mystery amen comes to a revelation in your heart and you don't see it as a mystery you see it as your story it's not a mystery anymore it's you amen it's your life it's your story it's your testimony it's who you are it's your identification amen that headship amen that cloud that appeared is no longer a cloud that appeared that was my headship where was he coming he was coming to unite with me [Applause] it's not a story amen it's not a picture on a wall it is me it's my life it christ in me the hope of glory paul was laboring till christ be formed in me and now the accuser of the brethren accuses you and now what do you say you say now we have the devil's answer amen we have the devil's answer it's not me it's him it's the resurrected christ he's coming back with the word it's the word it's not me it's the mystery that's laying under the seals it's the mystery of the entire bible amen he just revealed to me i'm part of it it's not me it's him with me but you're this and you're that that's not what's laying under the seals for me mr devil but you're this and you were born of that and you've always done that but that's not what was revealed under the mystery to me amen when the seals opened to me i saw my name in the book i heard my name called i recognized i was part of this mystery from before the foundation of the world and you say i'm a washout you say i'm a hypocrite you say i'm no good you say i'm defeated but i say i'm part of this mystery my revelation i can no more be lost and god can be lost because i was with him before the foundation of the world i've come from god i'm going to god by a revelation that was laying under the seals for me [Applause] i tell you that's the testimony that will bring him down friends that and that alone is the revelation in the testimony of the bride that will cast him down not saying i was sick and now i'm healed the pentecostals can do that there's got to be something more amen something when brother branham came to the seals in 1963 he says what we got now he had a restoration of the gifts had a tie-in together of loose sins had an explanation of the church ages but there's got to be a deeper mystery to bring you rapturing faith so that you can fly above all these denominations and fly above all of this to where you can get into the real revelation above amnesia above all of this stuff so you can fly so high you can say i remember where i came from [Music] but you're that no no no no no that was on my birth certificate that's just flesh that's not who i am do you remember when you did this and you remember when you did that remember when you said that oh you say but that's now i've been washed by the water of the word all the filth and everything's been washed away from me i've been redeemed amen the redeemer has come he's not still back there redeeming now he's here claiming and i'm part of what he claimed [Music] he was there redeeming redeeming through seven churches redeeming but when he's done redeeming in the last church ages now he steps forth to take the book and claim what he's redeemed now it's the claiming ministry and guess who he claimed mr devil he claimed me not by what i've done or not done but by a revelation that came at the opening of those seals by the revealing of the mystery that laid in that book that was bound up by those seven seals when the seven seals come off it opened up the entire bible now i know who i really am i'm not the son of charles and elibrano but i'm a son of god i'm not the daughter of this name in that name but i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god i'm not the person who lied and stole and cheated amen that was the body i was trapped into of no fault of my own the prophet says but god's got a plan for that body too and an absolute reformation amen when he's going to make it over in a glorified form i'm not going to be attached to this it's going to be changed that spirit that natural carnal spirit that i got that always is lying to me and causing me to doubt troubling my mind making me nervous and forgetful and all of these things that's going to go and be no more [Music] but the reality of what laid under the seals of me is still there and it's been awakened by the revelation in this hour i tell you friends that's the testimony will bring him down he says you're a liar and you says the word says you're no good the word says you haven't got it the word says and the accuser of the brethren is losing all his ammunition he can't use your hybridization anymore he can't use deception of church ages anymore he can't use confusion on doctrine anymore he's losing all his ammunition as these seals become more relevant and more real and more visible to us he's losing more of his ammunition if we will just lay claim to what's been given to us if we will just speak what's on those tapes if we'll just say what the prophet said and we'll say it with faith we'll believe it amen by a revelation of god personally to us it will say he's losing ground friends trust me he's losing ground and that's why this word came in this hour not to be books on your shelf not a picture on a wall not a tape in your tape player or an sd card on your phone that's not why it came it came to unlock the mystery of who the church was where she was in christ all along and what the mystery of god really is so you could rise to your position so that you can move out in the resurrection now if you give me five more minutes i want to get into the second part of my title the father's business let's go to luke chapter 2. i tell you friends i'm so excited to be alive the devil's losing all his footing every lie is slipping everything he's told me through my life is now so apparently wrong to me what i thought was true i now recognize is his lie what had me bound in my mind i now see his deception why because the light of the gospel is shining that light down unto the truth into the word and it's pushing all the darkness away and where he was working in obscurity god is bringing revelation and now clarity has no room for him to hide he was hiding in the uncertainty of the rapture he was hiding in the uncertainty of the bride he was hiding in the uncertainty of the church ages but that bright light has come to reveal all his hiding places and now he can't hide there anymore by what by the revelation of this end time message has taken away his hiding places there with no hiding he can't launch out and deceive you anymore because he has nothing to hide behind keep walking in the light friends keep pressing into the word this is not time to be a lazy laodicean this is time to be the bride of jesus christ for the bride has made herself ready she has taken this revelation and she's put it on she has taken this book she's ate it up you know when john came to the mighty angel he said give me the book the mighty angel didn't pull his jaw down and throw it down into his throat but he had to go to the angel because the voice said go into the angel and take the book so he walked to the angel listen god doesn't do everything he leaves something for you to do so you can prove that you're the predestinated of god we want to believe we're predestined when god pulls our jaw down and throws it down on our throat chomps it shut and says now you're it that's not how it works friends he does it by saying this is it do you want it this is it do you want it amen because if you're part of him you want it you want it you want it so bad you want more of it when you taste it you got to taste it again it's a revelation of who we really are he comes to the mighty angel and says give me the little book and the angel doesn't say well let me package it for me hold out your hand the angel says take it can you get it how long have you pursued that little book and reached for and reached for it again why because you wanted it because you wanted it when you got a hold of that little book he says now eat it up the term eat it up doesn't just mean take a bite eat it up means to eat it all right this revelation that's come eat it up eat it all and if you eat it all it'll be in your mouth sweet as honey but in your belly it'll be bitter listen when john takes the book before he eats it he knows what it's going to do to his belly and the apostle paul before he enters the ministry is told what great things he must suffer peter before he answered his ministry is told that at the end he will not be able to lead himself but his hands will be outstretched showing what manner of death he'll die but there's something about a predestinated seed of god amen there's something about the prize that makes the obstacles worth it there's something about him that makes the hazards worth it amen there's something about our god amen having him knowing him tasting him that makes the hazards that makes the difficulties that makes the bitterness worth it and he can tell you beforehand you're going to suffer and you'll say i'll suffer anyways if that's you because all my life i've wanted you now luke chapter 2 verse 46. luke 2 and 46 and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers when they saw him they were amazed this is jesus at 12 years old when he's left in jerusalem they travel three days they can't find him they come back to find him and here he is disputing and talking with the scholars verse 48 when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee with sorrowing. and he sayeth unto them how is it that you sought me i wish you not that i must be about my father's business jesus says a young manifested word say it that way so you can identify jesus is a young manifested word he's a manifested word you're a manifested word his mother the old church comes to him and gives him the wrong identification and he corrects her and says she denied the virgin birth she denied who he was that he was christ that he was the word made manifest in his day the church was giving a wrong identification but he corrected her i said no you're not that i must be about my father's business what was jesus doing that was his father's business he was breaking the word so what is the father's business to break the word you see jesus wasn't he wasn't doing dynamic things he wasn't doing miracles all of those were to attract the attention of the people so that he could break the word so that they could come to the breaking of the word and brother branham's day all the dynamic things that he was doing amen was to attract the attention of the people amen in the first and second pool so they get hooked in the third pool and the third pool was the revealing of the word so now he says nearly not i must be in my father's business and brother brennan says in 1965 the seat does not air with the shock it says notice there will be no more carrier mother churches denominations after this carrier shuck because after the shuck there is no more nothing left by then but just the grain is that right it's got to be the grain it's got to be the same kind that went into the ground jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever a spirit come upon the bride to do the same thing that he did it's the reproducing again of the grain all right the word yet young spake for itself and know not that i must be about my father's business there is the secret of the message now what's the secret of the message there is the secret of the message now just exactly the father's business what's the secret of the message that i must be about my father's business not my idea not my business what i think ought to be done what looks good what makes me look good what makes me popular but what i must be about now the secret of the message is the father's business then he says what is the father's business could you think of what the father's business was in him to fulfill what isaiah said a virgin shall conceive fulfill was isaiah said again the lame shall leap like a heart and all these things would take place like moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet among you like unto me it was the father's business to fulfill that word well if that come down through them stalks of them natural women what about these stalks of these spiritual church women churches means women women meets churches rather is that right then what is it now that's the question what is the father's business now we must be about the father's business the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what must it do vindicate malachi 4. how do i vindicate malachi 4 malachi 4 was already vindicated now the prophet was vindicated the vindication of malachi 4 is a people who are actually turned back to the faith of the fathers the vindication of malachi 4 is you amen and that's the father's business now to be that word made manifest to vindicate the ministry of malachi 4 and the ministry of malachi 4 is vindicated when you go back to the original faith of the pentecostal fathers to vindicate malachi 4 vindicate luke 17 30. what's vindicate 17 30 the revealing of the son of man you're to vindicate the revealing of the son of man i thought brother branham did that brother branham did it just to join the head and the body together in a marriage to do what to reproduce the son of man again in what form in bride form not here to repeat what brother branham did brother branham said he didn't all have to be moses there was one moses they had to receive moses message vindicate luke 17 30. what is it it's the revealing of the son of man how was he being revealed he's being revealed in bride form [Music] vindicate hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever same life same works same same spirit same everything what he has always been she is to be now what has he always been he has always been the anointed word for the day he was the rock that followed moses through the wilderness is that true he was the pillar of fire that led him he was the cloud that led him so i'm supposed to be a cloud no that was the manifestation of the word for their day christ was what the reproach of christ is what moses bore to leave egypt and go after his people so i have to i have to go to egypt and leave no this jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what is jesus christ the anointed word for the day and season that's what the bride is to be jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what the rock is i'm to be what the cloud was i'm to be to vindicate saint john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also he only did that which the father showed him not his own works but his father's works to vindicate all of his word vindicate hebrews i mean i mean revelations the 10th chapter of the opening of the seals and the mysteries of god even to serpent seed and all would be manifest in marriage and divorce and all these other mysteries that's been hid under the pillars for all these years from the theologians and so forth but is now the hour that's the father's business no matter what you thought it was before throw it out the window this is what a prophet told us this is the secret of the message today to be about the father's business and i want to be i want a testimony that will defeat the enemy what is your testimony your witness before a judge i witness that this word is true i stand as a witness that there's a power to change a life that there's a power to quicken a seed i stand as a witness that this word will change a life i stand as a witness that this word will raise you out of laodicea and bring you into the presence of jesus christ i stand as a witness let my voice go on record as a witness against the accuser of the brethren that i've been washed under the water of the word i've been anointed by the anointing of the word in this day and i believe this word to be every bit the truth [Applause] let me testify the devil says but i say by a witness by a revelation of jesus christ that this is the truth i'm here to vindicate hebrews 13 amen show me your signs chad if you can't see the bride coming it's not my fault if you can't see a life surrendered in humility if you can't see your brothers and sisters walking in the father's business if you can't see your brothers and sisters yielding daily to the word submitting and surrendering to the leadership of the word giving up old things casting away or wrong decisions and choosing the right way continually growing in the revelation and growing in the character of christ if you can't see the bride coming of christ it's not my fault but it's hebrews 13 8 just the same if you can't see luke 17 30 and this day it's not my fault but i want to be a witness say i see it amen i see it and my brothers and sisters i see it in a surrender to the word i see it in my life that being their lives that are being changed i see it in young people amen not running to the world and not toying with the things of the world but committing themselves to god into the word of god i can see it do you see the vindication of malachi 4 i am vindicating malachi 4. because i believe what paul believed and i believe what peter believed i've been returned to the faith of the pentecostal they defeated him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony i want my testimony to match this revelation that was under the thunders because what we had before that wasn't enough but since that time it's been enough to move us out into the rapture to catch us up out of laodicea to move us out of dead denominations and resurrect us into newness of life since that time it's been enough if it's been enough to do that it's enough to finish the job until the very atoms in this body of mind change what he's done he's doing what he's doing he'll do amen and there's a vindication going on in this day that's the father's business not to use our own mind and our own will and our own desires but to yield to that word and surrender to the revealed word and let the word bring its own life and let that life have preeminence in us and let that life live its own life out from us let's go to galatians chapter one i'll read this last scripture musicians you can come brother blake you can come as well galatians 1 and 10. for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man if i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ what is the new birth the revelation of jesus christ personally to you this is not a repeat message i heard the preacher say i repeat it that doesn't work it has no life i i heard i heard a good preacher and he tied together the doctrine i think i understand what the mystery under the seals were that's a repeat ministry that's not the true ministry but the true ministry is when god comes down and makes it real to you when you see the mystery underneath the mysteries when you see the mystery of god laying under those seals when you can identify and say i'm part of it amen there's something that changes amen now it's not a repeat ministry it's an original ministry and it's not here to please man it's not here to satisfy men but if you've ever come to that real revelation like the apostle paul did you're not here to please men your gospel is not here to please men because if you're here to please man you cannot please christ if you come under this revelation there's only one thing that matters and that's this word and that's this truth that's been given to us today it is quickening us it is changing us it is rapturing us it is resurrecting us and it is bringing us into the position he's always wanted us to be in it's the under the revelation the true revelation that's the only thing that matters i didn't receive this of man but didn't you listen to the tapes i listened tapes i read the quotes but i did not receive this of man i received it by the revelation of jesus christ it was christ speaking through that man it was christ speaking through the ministry it was christ laying on those tapes but it wasn't the hearing of this ear that brought the revelation it was a hearing of a different set of ears down here that quickened the seed the life and i said that's nothing but the truth not intellectually but in reality takes place in your mind will fade away but what takes place in your soul will be eternal never receive this by man was not taught this by man that's why we preach because it's the foolishness of preaching to save souls i'm not here to teach you the revelation of jesus christ i'm here to preach the revelation of jesus and if i'm faithful to preach the revelation of jesus christ christ is faithful to quicken the revelation in your hearts and then the mystery the secret of the message is to do the father's business to manifest the promised word for this day and the manifestation of the promised word in this day is jesus christ returning the headship coming in the bride the bride moving into the expression of the head the fullness of the word on display in a mini-membered body the very character nature life of jesus christ expressed in his bride that's the day you and i were chosen to live in what's it going to require a surrender a revelation and a surrender i say if god's given you the revelation what's your part the surrender he can supply the revelation but only you can supply the surrender is that true he's given the blood of the lamb but you must provide the testimony amen he can give the power of the holy ghost to be a witness but those who disciples are the ones that had to go and open their mouth in obedience god can give the holy ghost but you have to give the yielding to the spirit to open your mouth and you have to be the witness he can give the blood you have to give the testimony he can give the revelation but you have to speak but it's salvation when you believe in your heart and a revelation believe in your heart under righteousness but with the mouth confession is made into salvation god has faithfully done his part and i say god help me to faithfully do my part because i want to see the accuser of the brethren cast down can i read one more scripture revelation chapter 12. revelation chapter 12. verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens what's going to cause the heavens to rejoice because there was a people on the earth who did not love their lives to death and that would give a true testimony do you realize that the action of the bride at the end time will cause a rejoicing in heaven because the accuser of the brother has been cast down and he's not there anymore and why is he not there because the end time bride will say the word and stand by the word and the word only shall give a true witness and a true testimony and he'll be cast down and the admonishment in the scripture was rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them the cherubim the seraphim the heavenly host woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time when the bride goes up he comes down so what does what that makes you is an inhabiter of the heavenlies not an inhabiter of the earth sony says rejoice the heavenlies and all those that i have at them that's you when you get there in the full measure and the full revelation after the full catching away he won't be there and you won't be the only one rejoicing every other part of the heavenly host that god created to worship him in the heavenlies will be rejoicing as well because he's not there and he's not there because there was brethren who although they were accused they would testify they would testify of the true word revealed in their day and finally that testimony would bring an ultimate victory and all of heaven will rejoice that's the moment i'm living in that's the time i'm living for let's all stand oh this word is good friends and you never know what god's going to say on a wednesday night don't skip church god is so good to us this is the greatest day to be alive no time like this time this is the time this is the last moment these are the last strokes the last blows the last testimonies the last confessions this is it this is the time to be alive i don't want to miss it being lazy i don't want to miss it chasing rabbits and getting distracted i want to be tuned in because this is the time it's going to cause a rejoicing in heaven oh god is good peter if you'd like to make it around back and whoever wants to go around back with you can go brother bob if you want to get around there and get ready we'll have a baptismal service let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word oh god thank you this doesn't even seem like enough lord to say thank you it's just words lord coming off of frail human lips but god you know it's coming out of the depths of our heart how can we ever thank you enough for revealing this word to us for peeling back the seals for thundering out the thunders lord for showing us the mystery your mystery on top of all of that lord you showed us our part in the mystery we weren't just looking as spectators at the unfolding of the word but as the mystery unfolded we saw a threefold revelation when we saw a threefold revelation we were directed to the second fold of that threefold revelation and we were told that the second fold is your preeminence in us and as we saw the unveiling of you god as you were unveiling yourself and unveiling your plan unveiling your revelation you were showing us that we've always been part of that mystery oh god what a privilege what a privileged people we are of all human beings that have ever walked the earth i feel the luckiest lord the most blessed the most lord i just cherish this revelation help us god not to be lazy and let not let us not lose it let it not fade away but lord let it always be precious to us may we always dig and strive and reach out surrender lord and give more to you than we've ever given before and feed more on this book than we've ever fed may become more of a living reality in us may you move through us and testify through us and use us for your glory for you've called us to prophesy again let us be faithful in that calling oh we love you

sorts and he said and maybe a little disobedient i guess i could say that and he said he called peter they got alone and says what's going on and he burst into tears he said i gotta get baptized i didn't promise that i wouldn't cry but i'm rejoicing sally you rejoicing hallelujah because this is the prayer that we pray for all of our grandkids and it's manifest the angels in heaven are rejoicing why can't we we want to we we want to thank god for this opportunity i want you to grab your wrist like this and then i'll pull you up with that you can cover your nose if you want to father we just commit this this commitment to you we thank you that you've drawn and that you've drawn you've drawn us all lord we're standing here drawn by the holy ghost chosen by you and we believe lord that you've chosen peter benjamin in this hour in jesus christ's name now peter benjamin because you've given your heart to the lord and you've surrendered to his will and it's on that testimony that i indeed counted a privilege to baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ in the name of jesus christ you've promised lord to fill peter with the holy ghost we put his name in there because he's obedient to your word and you promised that you would give the holy ghost baptism and we ask that you'd fill him with the holy ghost and let him walk in newness of life your brother branham said that this was a an outward expression to an inward work and we rejoice in both the outward expression this evening and the inward work that only the holy ghost can do we committed to you and commit
