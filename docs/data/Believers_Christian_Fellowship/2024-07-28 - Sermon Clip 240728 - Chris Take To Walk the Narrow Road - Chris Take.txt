TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if there ever was a time and this brings us right back down to our point about the separation if there ever was a time that the Church of Christ needs its eyes opened it's today some more breaking bread their eyes were open and they recognized that it was him oh friend has he ever opened your eyes that way has he ever blessed you in such a way has he ever broke you apart from the things of the world because we are to be a type of Christ so we must be broken we must be broken go go back and listen to Masterpiece he has ever broke you apart from the things of the world separated you a breaking and an opening time that's what the church needs today is a breaking and an opening time you see it was twofold the breaking of the bread and the opening of their eyes if you go back and you and you listen to brother Bram the angel begins to tell him before The Reeling of the seals you need to be more sincere you see the seals and the opening of the word and those final years of his ministry that was the transition that was the word for the transition to move the bride from the church that's why it had to be recorded because we needed it this day that that transition in order to reach that he's the wave sheath right he's the one there first if you will so he what is whatever he needed to do be more sincere than you must as well am God is calling us to be more sincere to let go of the apathy of the age that we live in I mean everywhere you look it's laziness just just laziness unconcerned brother preach that message unconcerned you must be convinced and then concerned because something inside of you says this is really really really really important that's right I I this is very important the angel tells him you've got to be more sincere you're talking about the prophet amen what a position we have to attain to and I don't say that to discourage you I say that to encourage you to inspire you if you will just be more sincere that thing in your life that you want to take care of that that even your church friends say what's the big deal with that but God's calling you to let it go he's calling you higher because there's a highway and there's a way there's a way and that way leadth unto somebody say it unto life there is a way and that way leadth unto life he is the way the truth and the life and the truth shall set you free
