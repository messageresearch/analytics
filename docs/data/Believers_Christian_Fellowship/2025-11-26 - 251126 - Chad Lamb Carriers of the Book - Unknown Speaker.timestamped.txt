[0:34] Praise the Lord. Let's sing this
[0:36] together. Ever since Jesus saved and
[0:40] pardoned, I have been singing every day,
[0:45] I've never been sorry
[0:49] that I trusted his name.
[0:54] Through the dark shadows, he is with me,
[0:58] leading me on the upward way. And I've
[1:03] never been sorry
[1:06] that I trusted his name.
[1:10] Oh, I've never been sorry
[1:15] that I trusted his name.
[1:19] And every moment I find him,
[1:23] he's exactly the same.
[1:28] My soul has been singing
[1:32] since the Savior came.
[1:36] Oh, I've never been sorry
[1:40] that I trust in his Oh, sing that chorus
[1:43] again. I've never been sorry
[1:49] that I trusted his name.
[1:53] And every moment I find him
[1:58] exactly the same.
[2:02] My soul has been singing
[2:06] since the Savior came.
[2:10] And I've never been sorry.
[2:14] Oh, that I trust in his name.
[2:18] Amen. Never been sorry. We trusted his
[2:21] name. God bless you. It's good to be

[2:27] be together tonight through the wind and
[2:29] all the trials to get here. Amen. We get
[2:32] to praise him tonight. What a blessing
[2:34] that is. Amen. Let's just sing this.

[2:43] the lamb. I have passed the outer core.

[2:52] side. On the altar, sanctified
[2:56] to the world in sin I've died.

[3:32] of the blood. Oh, glory be to God.

[4:11] I have passed the outer veh

[4:29] sentence sin. Hallelujah to the lamb.

[8:18] Amen.
[8:20] All I want to see is Jesus.
[8:24] Oh, I know that the time is near where
[8:28] everything that I hold dear will lay
[8:32] before the holy

[8:43] every prayer sit on my knees. Lay before

[9:08] All I want to see is Jesus.
[9:15] Oh, shineing
[9:18] through me.
[9:22] Oh, selfinflicted pain. Everything that
[9:28] I thought gain lay before that holy
[9:33] consuming
[9:35] fire
[9:37] words of knowledge in his name healing
[9:41] hands they touch
[9:44] before the holy consume me fire
[9:51] and all I want to see
[9:54] is Jesus. does.
[9:58] Oh, all I want to see
[10:01] is him in me.
[10:05] And all I want to see is Jesus
[10:12] shineing
[10:15] through me.
[10:18] and hear him say,
[10:22] "Well done,
[10:25] my preious
[10:30] one.
[10:32] Well done.
[10:36] Well done.
[10:39] My faithful
[10:43] one.
[10:46] And all I want to see is Jesus.
[10:53] Oh, all I want to see is him in me.
[11:01] And all I want to see is Jesus,
[11:08] shineing
[11:10] through me.
[11:14] Amen. All we want to see is him tonight.
[11:17] Shining through me, through you, through
[11:19] our pastor, through one another, the
[11:21] word of God. Amen. Alive today.
[11:38] All host speak with tong
[11:45] of men and of angels.
[11:50] And oh, I prophesy
[11:56] and understand all.
[12:02] Although I have all faith,
[12:08] so mountains may be removed.
[12:14] Although I feed the poor
[12:20] and give up my life.
[12:26] If I have not charity,
[12:32] if love does not flow from me,
[12:37] I am nothing.
[12:43] Jesus reduced me to love.
[12:54] Love is patient and kind.
[13:00] Love is not envious,
[13:05] not proud, but gentle and meek,
[13:11] seeks not its own way.
[13:17] Love sings when Jesus prevails,
[13:23] believes and endures all things.
[13:29] Love hopes and bears every wrong.
[13:35] And love never fails.
[13:41] If I have not charity,
[13:47] if love does not flow from me,
[13:52] I am nothing.
[13:58] Jesus reduced me to love.
[14:08] One season when I was a child,
[14:14] I spoke and I thought as a child.
[14:20] But when I turn to amen,
[14:25] such ways put aside.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; And now we see through our glass,
[14:37] but then we shall see face to face.
[14:43] And now abide faith and hope.
[14:49] But the greatest is love.
[14:55] If I have not charity,
[15:01] if love does not flow from me,
[15:06] I am nothing.
[15:12] Jesus reduced me to love.
[15:17] love.
[15:22] If I have not charity,
[15:28] if love does not flow from me,
[15:33] I am
[15:36] nothing.
[15:39] Jesus, reduce me, Lord. Jesus, reduce
[15:44] me. Jesus
[15:47] reduced me to love.
[16:05] Wonderful, merciful
[16:08] savior,
[16:10] our precious redeemer and friend.
[16:16] Who would have thought that a lamb
[16:20] could
[16:22] rescue the souls of men?
[16:26] Oh, you rescue the souls of men.
[16:33] And you are the one that we praise.
[16:39] You are the one we adore.
[16:44] You give the healing and praise. Our
[16:50] hearts always hunger for.
[16:54] Oh, our hearts always hunger for
[17:01] counselor, comforter, keeper,
[17:06] the spirit we long to embrace.
[17:12] Oh, you offer hope when our hearts
[17:18] hopelessly lost our way.
[17:22] Oh, and we've hopelessly lost our way.
[17:28] But you are the one that we praise.
[17:35] You are the one we adore.
[17:40] You give thy healing and grace song.
[17:46] Hearts always hunger for.
[17:50] Oh, our hearts always hunger for.
[17:57] Amen.
[17:59] Are you still hungry for him?
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we realize what he's done for
[18:03] us and how wonderful he is and how
[18:06] hopeless we were and all that he's done
[18:08] for us, how could we not love him more?
[18:11] &gt;&gt; How we not love him back when he first
[18:13] loved us? Amen. It's a privilege to be
[18:16] here with you tonight. Let's bow our
[18:17] heads together. Let's pray. Dear
[18:20] heavenly father, we thank you, Lord
[18:22] Jesus, that you have once again gathered
[18:24] us together. Lord, that you have drawn
[18:27] us by your drawing power. And God, we've
[18:29] come here to hear your word, to sing
[18:32] your praises, to meet with our brothers
[18:34] and sisters, to glorify your name. Now,
[18:37] we come to the part of the service,
[18:38] Lord, where we open our Bibles and we
[18:41] read your word, Lord. And God, it's
[18:43] going to take more than literacy, Lord,
[18:45] tonight. It's going to take a revelation
[18:47] from you to bring us into our position
[18:50] to open our eyes for us to see all that
[18:52] you want us to see this evening. Lord, I
[18:55] pray that you'd give us a fresh dose of
[18:57] the Isav. Give us ears to hear and a
[18:59] heart to perceive all you have. And may
[19:02] you take this vessel of mine under your
[19:04] complete control and take preeminence
[19:06] among all of us, both speaker and hear.
[19:08] And may you speak words of life and may
[19:10] they be received by your children. We
[19:13] love you, Lord. We ask you to take
[19:15] preeminence among us in Jesus Christ's
[19:17] name we pray. Amen.
[19:21] Amen. God bless you all this evening.
[19:23] Amen. If you want to take your Bibles,
[19:25] we'll turn to Ephesians while you're
[19:26] still standing. And I just want to give
[19:28] you an early happy Thanksgiving. Amen.
[19:30] Thanksgiving happens to be one of my
[19:32] favorite all-time holidays in the whole
[19:34] calendar year. And so I'm looking
[19:36] forward to spending some time with my
[19:37] family tomorrow and so thankful for all
[19:40] that God's done. Amen. Every year I'm
[19:42] more thankful than the year before.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; And God continues to unveil himself and
[19:47] we have so much more to be thankful for.
[19:50] Amen. Also want to appreciate uh brother
[19:53] Benjamin, sister Amanda Seabolt for
[19:54] opening the home for those who don't
[19:56] have family in the area and don't have a
[19:57] place to gather. They're gathering there
[19:59] tomorrow. So may God bless them. And
[20:01] also I just want to ask you to remember
[20:03] sister Nancy Marorrow's family. I'm sure
[20:05] it's a little fresh just losing their
[20:07] mom and grandma right when they come
[20:09] into a holiday season. And I was
[20:11] thinking of the Golden family as well.
[20:12] They lost Sister Jan last year at this
[20:14] time. So I'm sure it's still hard for
[20:16] them. So as we gather, just remember
[20:19] those families as well. Amen. Also
[20:22] before we read, I want to remind you
[20:23] that this Sunday this week, I'll be down
[20:25] at Junction City. So ask you to remember
[20:28] to be praying for that. And Brother Gabe
[20:29] Smith will be ministering here. So keep
[20:31] him in prayer as well. Amen. So we look
[20:35] forward to that. Uh let's read Ephesians
[20:38] chapter 3 while we're in the book of
[20:39] Ephesians. Let's go to chapter 3.
[20:46] It's been a while since I've been with
[20:47] the saints down in Junction City, so I'm
[20:49] excited to go and see them. See how
[20:51] they're doing. So just keep us in
[20:53] prayer. And always they're predicting
[20:57] snow for Saturday night. Why not Friday?
[21:00] Why not Thursday? Why not get snowed in
[21:02] at Thanksgiving? But we just believe God
[21:04] God will work it all out. Amen. Every
[21:07] year when it comes around, I don't know
[21:08] why I'm so shocked. Every Wednesday and
[21:10] Saturday they call for snow. But praise
[21:11] God, God's good anyhow. Amen.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14
[21:22] says, "For this cause I bow my knees
[21:24] unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[21:25] Christ, of whom the whole family in
[21:28] heaven and earth is named. Amen." God
[21:31] bless you. How many's happy to have that
[21:33] name? You can have your seats. Amen. God
[21:36] bless you. I'm happy to be part of that
[21:38] name. That's why I'm baptized in that
[21:40] name. That's why we pray in that name.
[21:41] That's why all that we do, both in word
[21:43] and deed, we do all in the name of the
[21:45] Lord Jesus. Amen. Because we recognize
[21:48] who he is to us. He's the head of the
[21:50] family. And he's the one who bought back
[21:53] uh the rights of redemption. Amen. God
[21:55] bless you, brother Jonathan. It's good
[21:57] to see you and your wife and your kids.
[21:58] It's good to have you guys here. and I
[22:00] appreciate that special with you and
[22:01] brother Daniel. God bless you. Amen.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; I want to turn to Colossians 2 while we
[22:07] have our Bibles handy. Let's go over to
[22:09] Colossians
[22:11] chapter 1. I'm going to read uh this
[22:14] portion here starting at verse 18.
[22:16] Colossians 1 and verse 18.
[22:22] And he is the head of the body, the
[22:24] church, who is the beginning, the
[22:26] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[22:27] things he might have the preeminence.
[22:30] For it pleased the father that in him
[22:31] should all fullness dwell. And having
[22:34] made peace through the blood of his
[22:35] cross, by him to reconcile all things
[22:38] unto himself, by him, I say, whether
[22:40] they be things in earth or things in
[22:42] heaven. And you that were sometimes
[22:44] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[22:47] wicked works. Yet now hath he reconciled
[22:49] in the body of his flesh through death
[22:52] to present you holy and unblameable and
[22:55] unreprovable in his sight. Amen. I'm so
[22:58] glad that he's reconciled us to himself
[23:01] in the body of Jesus Christ's flesh
[23:04] because God came. Amen. He made a body
[23:06] of flesh to dwell in and by that body he
[23:09] has reconciled us back to himself
[23:12] because there had to be a price paid for
[23:14] mankind. Amen. We were into this so deep
[23:16] on Sunday. It blessed me so much. I'm
[23:18] still feasting off the revelation from
[23:20] Sunday's service just to realize truly
[23:23] what God has done for us, friends. It
[23:26] means so much to me and and I want to go
[23:28] a little bit into that. I just want to
[23:30] uh talk about a little bit, maybe go uh
[23:32] a little different direction with it.
[23:34] But if we can bring the PowerPoint up,
[23:36] Brother Franco, I want to talk about
[23:37] carriers of the book. Amen. We were
[23:40] talking about the book on Sunday. When
[23:41] we look here at this reconciliation,
[23:45] he's reconciled all things into unto
[23:47] himself. Amen. And and he's reconciled
[23:51] us in the body of his flesh. And this
[23:53] word reconcile means to reconcile
[23:56] completely, to reconcile back again,
[23:58] bring back a former state of harmony. So
[24:02] what is he being trying to do? He's
[24:03] trying to take what's disharmonized and
[24:06] disjointed and he's trying to bring it
[24:08] back together again, back into harmony.
[24:11] Amen. And we know, amen, that man fell
[24:13] in the Garden of Eden and broke the
[24:15] harmony and fellowship with God and
[24:17] broke the harmony of God's purpose and
[24:19] plan. Amen. And now, amen, God has
[24:22] through Jesus Christ reconciled us back
[24:24] to himself. Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So, it took a man and
[24:29] he was that man. And now, when we look
[24:31] at carriers of the book, I'm going to go
[24:33] back into Revelations 5 and we're just
[24:35] going to hit a few spots and move on. It
[24:38] says, "And I saw on the right hand of
[24:40] him that sat on the throne a book
[24:42] written within and on the backside
[24:44] sealed with seven seals, and I saw a
[24:47] strong angel proclaim with a loud voice.
[24:49] Who is worthy to open the book and to
[24:51] loose the seals thereof?" And no man in
[24:54] heaven. Amen. Do you see this word man?
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; No man, it had to be a man.
[25:04] No man in heaven nor in earth neither
[25:06] under the earth was able to open the
[25:08] book neither to look thereon. Amen. Adam
[25:11] was there. Amen. Because it looked it
[25:13] looked at no man in heaven nor in earth
[25:16] neither under the earth. Amen. That was
[25:18] all of them.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; That that encapsulated all men. And he
[25:22] looked at all men and there wasn't
[25:24] anybody worthy. And Adam was there. Of
[25:26] course, Adam wasn't worthy. Adam was
[25:28] worthy to hold the book at one point,
[25:30] but he lost his worthiness when he left
[25:32] the word.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; And now he could never reconcile himself
[25:36] back because now he's perverted. He's
[25:38] corrupted. And you can't you can't use a
[25:40] spotted lamb, amen, to bring back a
[25:43] reconciliation. It must be a perfect
[25:45] lamb. Amen. And so down through the Old
[25:48] Testament, there was no perfect lamb.
[25:50] There was no man. And there was no son
[25:52] of God that could fully obey all the
[25:54] word of God and walk in perfect
[25:56] righteousness and harmony with God that
[25:58] could take back that book that could buy
[26:00] back redemption that could pay for what
[26:02] Adam lost. Amen. So God came down and
[26:05] became that man himself.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; And he became a man. Amen. A real man
[26:11] who ate and SLEPT AND GOT TIRED. AMEN. A
[26:14] real man.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not half man. Not an operation.
[26:18] Not a figure, but a man. And he became a
[26:20] man. A man whose toenails grew out. A
[26:23] man whose hair had to be cut. Amen. A
[26:25] man who got hungry and had to eat. He
[26:27] was a man.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; A man who could be beaten and feel the
[26:31] sting of pain. A man could be rejected.
[26:33] A man who could mourn. A man who could
[26:35] grief. A man who could weep at Lazarus's
[26:37] grave. A man who could be heartbroken.
[26:39] Amen. Over the the lack of belief and
[26:42] and lack of revelation amongst the
[26:44] people he came to save. A man that could
[26:46] weep over Jerusalem.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; A man that could feel. A man that could
[26:50] be touched. A MAN, AMEN, THAT COULD LAY
[26:52] DOWN IN THE BACK of a boat exhausted
[26:54] when the STORM BREAKS OUT. A MAN,
[26:57] &gt;&gt; he became a man. Amen. Because God, oh,
[27:00] praise God. God, Amen. gave this
[27:03] inheritance of this creation of this
[27:06] earth to a man. Amen. God, Amen. God
[27:09] wanted This is the inheritance of man.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; This is why I was talking about Sunday.
[27:16] Amen. I'm going to refer some back to
[27:17] that. But but but all my life I thought
[27:23] I was getting saved so I could go to
[27:25] heaven.
[27:27] Did anybody else believe that growing up
[27:28] in denominations? I mean maybe not even
[27:31] denominations, maybe in the message. I
[27:33] thought I was getting saved so I could
[27:34] go to heaven. Amen. And and my salvation
[27:37] didn't have anything with me going to
[27:38] heaven.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; That's not WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. THE
[27:44] reconciliation wasn't about going back
[27:45] to heaven. Amen. It was about
[27:47] reconciling what man had lost. And man
[27:50] had lost his right, amen, to rule the
[27:52] earth. He had lost his inheritance of
[27:54] the creation. And he had lost his
[27:56] fellowship with God. Amen. And now what
[27:59] Jesus Christ came to do WAS TO RESTORE
[28:02] BACK WHICH MAN LOST. AMEN. GOD, HE
[28:04] DIDN'T DIE SO THAT WE COULD GO to
[28:06] heaven. AMEN. HE DIED so he could
[28:08] reconcile all that was separated and
[28:10] lost from man so that man could
[28:12] eventually live as THE FAMILY OF GOD in
[28:14] the presence of God in fellowship with
[28:16] God in harmony WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THIS
[28:19] EARTH AS A GOD RACE ON THIS EARTH.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; That word salvation when I looked at the
[28:25] word salvation. Amen. I've heard it all
[28:27] my life and and I was getting saved and
[28:30] I was always needing to be saved and I
[28:32] grew up Pentecostal boy. So every time I
[28:34] made a mistake I had to get saved again.
[28:37] Amen. We were Armenian in our doctrine
[28:39] and and we had to every time you failed,
[28:41] you fell from grace and you had to get
[28:42] saved again. And I was being saved
[28:44] because I was lost. And and brother
[28:46] Brandham said, "You were never saved on
[28:48] any certain day. You were always saved."
[28:50] IF YOU'RE A CHILD OF GOD, a gene of God,
[28:52] an attribute from God, you can no more
[28:55] be lost than God can be got lost. YOU
[28:57] WERE IN FLESH in a lost condition
[29:01] &gt;&gt; and you were separated from fellowship,
[29:05] &gt;&gt; but your name was in the lamb's book of
[29:07] life from before the foundation of the
[29:09] world.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; So this word salvation is the word soozo
[29:14] in the Greek and it means healing.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; So what happened? WE WERE SICK.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; WE WERE BROKEN.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD NEEDED HEALED.
[29:25] OUR BODY NEEDED HEALED. AMEN. The earth
[29:28] needed healed. Everything needed healed.
[29:30] So what is salvation? Our salvation is a
[29:33] healing. Amen. What is healing? Hey,
[29:36] think about when you need healing. When
[29:38] you need healing, what's going on in
[29:39] your body? Something is wrong with you.
[29:42] And your healing WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO
[29:44] THE STATE YOU WERE IN BEFORE YOU got
[29:46] sick. This healing is TO BRING US BACK
[29:48] TO WHAT WE WERE BEFORE WE GOT SICK.
[29:51] BEFORE THE SI sin sickness hit us.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; IT'S BRINGING US BACK. IT'S A
[29:56] RECONCILIATION. It's a restoration. It's
[29:59] a redemption.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it had to be man.
[30:04] So, no nor no man in heaven nor in
[30:07] earth, neither under the earth was able
[30:09] to open the book, neither to look
[30:11] thereon. And I wept much because no man
[30:15] was found worthy.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; They found men. There was men all over
[30:20] the but no man was found worthy
[30:23] because there was only one that was
[30:25] worthy and he was born without sin.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Romans chapter 8 together.
[30:35] Romans chapter 8.
[30:38] There's something about this subject
[30:40] that thrills my heart so much
[30:43] because
[30:44] it's taken the gospel message and it's
[30:47] taken what what churches and humanity
[30:51] and human thinking has diluted into just
[30:54] a story and it's brought it back into
[30:56] full force of its power.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; What Christ come really did and what
[31:01] it's all about and the impact that it
[31:03] has on everything.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I was saying I'm
[31:09] sorry. We need to read the scripture. I
[31:11] know, but but I just can't help it.
[31:13] Amen. We say, you know, uh heaven is not
[31:16] my destination.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; It's not my destination. Earth is.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Our millennial reign, our honeymoon
[31:23] takes place on earth. Amen. Then the
[31:25] then the new city, the new Jerusalem
[31:27] descends upon the earth. Amen. A
[31:29] mountain rises and a city falls. This is
[31:31] symbolic of the two two different
[31:33] spheres, the heavenly sphere and the
[31:35] earthly sphere joining and uniting and
[31:37] whatever barrier separates them will be
[31:39] gone and we'll live as a family of God
[31:41] upon the earth. Amen. God as a family
[31:44] and fellowship together with no barrier
[31:46] of separation at all. Amen. And that's
[31:48] going to take place on this earth.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; If you think about uh if you think about
[31:54] when brother Benham went beyond the
[31:55] curtain of time, when he began the
[31:57] curtain of time, he met all these
[31:58] saints. They're they're in perfection.
[32:00] And they're in their youth. They're in
[32:01] theophony bodies. They're running on
[32:03] grass. Amen. They're they're they're
[32:05] fit. They're He said, "The most
[32:07] beautiful people you've ever seen,
[32:08] strong and handsome men and beautiful
[32:10] women." And running up to him, hugging,
[32:11] saying, "My precious brother." And he's
[32:13] in a place of perfection, beyond
[32:15] perfection, of love and only love. And
[32:17] sublime said, "By sublime." There's
[32:20] nothing he can describe it with. And
[32:21] he's so excited to get there. Amen. All
[32:23] of a sudden, Amen. He he he doesn't want
[32:26] to leave. He feels something stirring
[32:28] inside, a funny feeling. He turns and
[32:30] sees his body moving on the bed and he
[32:32] says, "I don't have to go back, do I?"
[32:35] &gt;&gt; That was his attitude having just
[32:36] arrived. But what was the attitude of
[32:38] all the saints that were in the sixth
[32:40] dimension? They were saying, "Hey, one
[32:41] day Christ will come and judge you for
[32:43] what you preach AND WE'LL GO BACK TO
[32:45] EARTH."
[32:46] &gt;&gt; THEY WEREN'T FINISHED WITH THEIR
[32:48] JOURNEY. SALVATION was more to them than
[32:51] just getting to heaven. THEY HAD ALREADY
[32:52] ARRIVED. IF HEAVEN WAS THE GOAL, THEY'VE
[32:54] GOT IT. BUT NO, THE GOAL WAS FAR BEYOND
[32:57] GOING TO HEAVEN, FAR BEYOND MOVING INTO
[32:59] PERFECTION, FAR BEYOND GOING INTO THE
[33:01] ATMOSPHERE OF perfect love. They're they
[33:03] were destined. They were predestinated.
[33:06] They were made. They were men. They were
[33:08] made to live on the earth and inhabit
[33:10] the earth and be a race of God men on
[33:13] the earth. And while they were in
[33:15] perfection, THEY WERE NOT FINISHED. AND
[33:17] THEY WERE LOOKING forward to something
[33:19] coming next. Amen.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. This message has
[33:26] unlocked the gospel, friends.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Has brought the truth. It has unveiled
[33:31] Christ to us. Hallelujah.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; So much I want to say, but I got I want
[33:36] to move to other things, too. I want to
[33:38] say it all. I want to preach it all. I
[33:40] want to preach all night. I want to
[33:41] preach every day because this thing,
[33:43] this is what I love.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; This is who I am. This is touching
[33:47] something so deep inside of me. I can't
[33:49] explain it. I can't put it all together.
[33:52] But it's touching the core of who I am.
[33:54] This is what I was born for. This is
[33:56] what I was a thought in his mind for.
[33:58] This is what I've been destined for.
[34:00] This is what God when he thought of me
[34:01] as an attribute. However, he thought of
[34:03] me, he thought of me coming to this
[34:05] revelation, to this place, and for it to
[34:07] be manifest in me.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; I know that.
[34:12] In Romans 8:17
[34:15] it says,
[34:17] "And if children then heirs, heirs of
[34:21] God and joint hes with Christ, if so be
[34:23] that we suffer with him, that we may be
[34:25] also glorified together."
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[34:30] present time are not worthy to be
[34:32] compared with the glory which shall be
[34:34] revealed in us. For the earnest
[34:36] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[34:38] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[34:40] For the creature was made subject to
[34:42] vanity, not willingly, but by reason of
[34:45] him who has subjected the same in hope.
[34:48] So now the earth is waiting for
[34:51] something.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; The creation the the the creature means
[34:56] the creation for the earnest expectation
[34:58] of the creation waited for the
[35:00] manifestation of the sons of God. Why is
[35:02] the creature Why is creation waiting for
[35:04] the manifestation of the sons of God?
[35:06] Because earth was meant to be ruled by
[35:09] sons of God.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; And when a son of God fell, earth fell.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Everything under Adam fell. And this
[35:18] earth wants to go back to the condition
[35:21] it was in before.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; So it's waiting for the manifestation or
[35:26] the revealing or the unveiling of the
[35:27] sons of God. For the creature was made
[35:30] subject to vanity. Amen. And and and
[35:33] this word vanity is is weakness. and and
[35:36] frailty. Amen. It's broken. This
[35:39] creature, the creature was made subject
[35:40] to vanity, not willingly, but by reason
[35:43] of him who has subjected the same in
[35:45] hope. Amen. It wasn't the creation's
[35:47] fault. It was man's fault.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; But there's a hope. There's a hope of
[35:51] redemption.
[35:53] Verse 21. Because the creature itself
[35:55] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[35:58] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[36:01] of the children of God. When the
[36:03] children of God go free, earth goes
[36:05] free.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; For we know that the whole creation
[36:09] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[36:11] until now. This is why brother Brandham
[36:14] when he talks about the crucifixion at
[36:16] the day of crucifixion, he said there
[36:17] was an earthquake and the sun turned to
[36:20] black as sackcloth. Amen. And and and
[36:22] the mountains trembled and everything
[36:24] happened. And you know how brother
[36:26] Brandham describes the earthquake and
[36:28] the sun turning black? He says the sun
[36:31] hid its face behind its hands and wept
[36:35] for joy.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; And he said the earthquake, he says, was
[36:42] the hills skipping like rams upon the
[36:45] hills. Amen. What was he said the earth
[36:47] was a jumping and A SHOUTING. AMEN.
[36:49] BECAUSE of redemption. Because now there
[36:52] was a MAN WHO COULD BUY BACK WHAT ADAM
[36:54] LOST. And the earth was reacting to the
[36:56] redemption that was taking place at
[36:58] Calvary. And you would look at that and
[37:00] said, "That's terrible, an earthquake.
[37:02] OH, THE SUN WENT BLACK." AND THE EARTH
[37:04] is having a jubilee because now there's
[37:07] a man that's come TO PAY THE PRICE
[37:09] BECAUSE THE EARTH GOES FREE. When men go
[37:11] free, when men come BACK TO THEIR
[37:13] POSITION, THE EARTH COMES BACK TO ITS
[37:15] POSITION.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; OH, ONLY A PROPHET CAN TELL A STORY THAT
[37:20] WAY. ONLY A PROPHET COULD TELL US THE
[37:21] BLACKOUT OF THE SUN WAS THAT SON WEEPING
[37:24] be with his hands behind his face behind
[37:26] his head WEEPING FOR JOY AT REDEMPTION.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; AND THE EARTHQUAKE WAS THE MOUNTAINS
[37:32] JUMPING UP AND DOWN BECAUSE WE'RE COMING
[37:34] BACK. WE'RE COMING BACK. WE'RE COMING
[37:36] BACK. THE EARTH DOESN'T WANT TO BE
[37:38] FALLEN. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS CYCLE OF
[37:40] DESTRUCTION AND HURRICANES AND
[37:41] EARTHQUAKES AND FIRES IS ALL ABOUT?
[37:43] AMEN. THIS EARTH IS ABOUT READY TO
[37:45] REJUVENATE ITSELF. IT WANTS TO COME BACK
[37:47] TO ITS POSITION. YES.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; And it's waiting for the manifestation
[37:52] of the sons of God. That has to do with
[37:54] you and I.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] We are linked to this earth. Our bodies
[38:00] are taken from this earth. Amen. God
[38:02] took a portion of this earth to redeem
[38:04] the rest of this earth. You're not going
[38:06] to separate the sons of God from earth.
[38:08] That's right.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[38:12] In the sixth seal, it says that's the
[38:14] reason John wept. Because if no one
[38:16] could get that book, all creation,
[38:18] everything was gone. She just simply
[38:21] turned back to atoms and molecules and
[38:23] so forth and cosmic light and not even
[38:24] be creation person, nothing else. Cuz
[38:26] Adam lost the rights of that book. He
[38:29] forfeited it when he listened to his
[38:30] wife and she listened to Satan's
[38:32] reasoning instead of the word of God. So
[38:35] if John was weeping because nobody, no
[38:40] man could take the book. And he was
[38:41] weeping because he knew that all
[38:43] creation everything was gone.
[38:48] In the sixth seal again he says and
[38:50] there's a price and that's redemption.
[38:52] There's some price for redemption and
[38:53] there was nobody could do it. So he made
[38:56] his own laws of kinsman redeemer then
[38:58] they could find nobody. Every man was
[39:00] born of sex born after sexual desire. He
[39:03] was in the original sin Satan and Eve.
[39:05] So he could not do it. There's nothing
[39:07] in him. no holy pope, priest, doctor,
[39:09] divinity or whatever he might be. He was
[39:11] nobody worthy and he couldn't be an
[39:14] angel because it had to be a kinsman. He
[39:16] had to be a man. Then God himself became
[39:19] kinsman by taking on human flesh through
[39:21] the virgin birth and he shed his blood.
[39:25] Oh, I'm so thankful.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5. Now we're reading
[39:31] next right what after what we just read
[39:33] after John weeping. And one of the
[39:34] elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold,
[39:36] the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root
[39:38] of David, hath prevailed to open the
[39:40] book, and to loose the seven seals
[39:42] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[39:44] midst of the throne, and of the four
[39:46] beasts, and in the midst of the elders
[39:47] stood a lamb, as it had been slain,
[39:49] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[39:51] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[39:53] into all the earth. And he came and took
[39:56] the book.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, he took the book.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for the future. He
[40:04] took the book.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Out of the right hand of him that sat
[40:10] upon the throne.
[40:12] And what did he do with that book? He
[40:15] tore open the seals.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; He revealed the mystery of that book.
[40:19] Took the veil off of it so we would
[40:21] understand it. And then what did he do
[40:23] with the book? He brought it down to
[40:25] earth.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; You realize the title deed of all
[40:28] redemption, man's right to rule the
[40:30] earth. Amen. To be a god upon the earth.
[40:33] That does not belong in heaven.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; That book doesn't belong in heaven. The
[40:38] book went to heaven for safekeeping. So
[40:40] Satan couldn't get his hands on it. And
[40:42] it sat in the right hand of him that sit
[40:44] upon the throne. The original giver of
[40:46] the title deed. Who did he give the
[40:47] title deed to? He gave it to man. When
[40:50] man lost it so Satan wouldn't get it, it
[40:52] God takes it back himself. But he's
[40:54] waiting to give it to another man. And
[40:57] when he gives it to the man, it's the
[40:58] man Christ Jesus. And when the man
[41:00] Christ Jesus is found worthy to take the
[41:03] book, he takes the book. And what does
[41:05] he do with the book? He brings it back
[41:07] to earth cuz the book belongs on earth.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; I love this. It's so simple. It's so
[41:15] amazing. It's so beautiful. It's so
[41:17] everything all together. So he brings it
[41:19] back to earth as an open book in his
[41:21] hand and and he roars as a lion roars
[41:24] and seven thunders utter their voices.
[41:26] And and then we know, amen, that's to be
[41:28] sealed up till the time of the end. But
[41:30] in the end, we would know those seven
[41:31] thunders. And then the mystery of God
[41:33] would be finished. And then we go to
[41:35] Revelation 10:8.
[41:38] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[41:40] spake unto me again and said, "Go and
[41:42] take the little book which is open in
[41:44] the hand of the angel which standeth
[41:45] upon the sea and upon the earth."
[41:47] Brother Benham said when that mighty
[41:49] angel come down in 101 with an open
[41:50] book, he said the same book that was
[41:52] sealed and closed in Revelation chapter
[41:54] 5, which is the book of redemption,
[41:57] &gt;&gt; which is the title deed.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Which is the marriage certificate,
[42:02] &gt;&gt; which is the word,
[42:05] &gt;&gt; which is everything.
[42:07] Amen. And I went unto the angel, and I
[42:10] said unto him, give me the little book.
[42:12] And he said unto me, "Take it and eat it
[42:14] up, and it shall make thy belly bitter,
[42:15] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[42:18] honey." And look at this. And I took the
[42:21] little book.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; This is remarkable. This is John who's
[42:27] not worthy. He's not worthy.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; That was ESTABLISHED IN CHAPTER 5. No
[42:33] man in heaven, no man on earth, no man
[42:34] under the earth was found worthy, amen,
[42:36] to take the book, to look on it, to to
[42:39] touch it, to read it. No man. AND JOHN
[42:41] WAS THERE. He wasn't worthy. He couldn't
[42:43] touch it. He couldn't look at it. He
[42:45] couldn't look on. He couldn't read it.
[42:47] Amen. He couldn't take it. What's he
[42:49] doing taking the book? Amen. Because the
[42:51] worthy one took it and brought it down
[42:54] for the whole family.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; He did it for all of us. Amen. He didn't
[42:59] take it to keep it to himself. Amen. Re
[43:02] realize GOD GAVE this book to his son
[43:07] and Adam was supposed to bring forth the
[43:09] contents of the book which is the family
[43:11] of God. And when he hybridized himself,
[43:13] he failed and he could no longer bring
[43:15] forth the contents of the book in
[43:17] perfection. Amen. Now it would come
[43:19] forth in a perverted way. Amen. Through
[43:21] hybridization. SO GOD TOOK BACK THAT
[43:23] BOOK waiting to give it back to
[43:25] somebody. But he wanted to give it to
[43:28] his children. He wanted to give it to
[43:29] his sons and daughters. He wanted to
[43:31] give it to his offspring that would
[43:32] become flesh and live upon the earth.
[43:34] Amen. So he just holds it waiting for
[43:36] one. None's worthy. So he becomes that
[43:38] one. And he does it for his whole
[43:40] family. That's why when Jesus went ON
[43:43] THE CROSS, I WAS IN HIM THEN because God
[43:45] came TO BECOME THE WHOLE family in one
[43:48] man. And that one man represented the
[43:50] entire family as the headship of the
[43:52] family. So I was included in there
[43:54] because he's the head of the family and
[43:56] THE FULLNESS OF GOD. THE GOD HAD DWELT
[43:59] IN HIM BODILY. SO ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE
[44:01] POURED INTO CHRIST. EVERYTHING, ALL THE
[44:04] CONTENTS OF THAT BOOK WAS IN HIM.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Because what are the believers? The
[44:10] words on the book.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO NOW HE PURCHASED BACK,
[44:15] AMEN. BY THE SHEDDING of his blood.
[44:17] AMEN. HE PURCHASED BACK THE BOOK. HE
[44:19] PURCHASED BACK CREATION. PURCHASE BACK
[44:21] the right to take the book. But when he
[44:23] takes the book, Amen. Now God did this.
[44:27] He he he become man. He became flesh.
[44:29] She became a man to become the head of
[44:31] the family so that he could take the
[44:34] book back for the whole family.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; GOD DID THIS FOR US.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; NOT THAT HE WOULD do it, AMEN. THAT THAT
[44:43] CHRIST WOULD keep it for himself, BUT HE
[44:44] BROUGHT IT DOWN because we're joint hes
[44:47] with Christ.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; So now he brings the open BOOK AND NOW
[44:51] JOHN is a type of the bride. JOHN COMES
[44:54] TO HIM. AMEN. because a voice of heaven
[44:56] tells him to go to the mighty angel and
[44:57] take the book. And he says, "I want the
[44:59] book." And he says, "Take the book. THIS
[45:01] IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO you when you take
[45:02] it." And then it says, "AND I TOOK THE
[45:05] BOOK." NOW THE UNWORTHY ONE TOOK THE
[45:08] BOOK. AMEN. BECAUSE HE COMES to the
[45:10] worthy one who was able TO TAKE THE
[45:12] BOOK. And the worthy one gives him the
[45:14] book.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he declared him worthy.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; And if he declared him worthy, then he's
[45:22] worthy.
[45:25] Amen.
[45:26] And I took the book out of the angel's
[45:28] hand, and I ate it up, and it was in my
[45:30] mouth, sweet as honey. And as soon as I
[45:32] had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And
[45:34] he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[45:36] again before many peoples and nations
[45:39] and tongues and kings."
[45:42] This is what I really want to bring to
[45:44] you this evening just in a short message
[45:48] is
[45:50] he takes the book
[45:53] but he doesn't take it for himself.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; He takes it for the whole family.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Then he brings it down and gives access
[46:00] to the family that's alive on earth at
[46:02] the time which is the end time bride.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; And he gives access to that book to us
[46:08] which is the revelation of the mystery
[46:09] of God. Amen.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; God's secret plan that he had in his
[46:13] mind all along.
[46:14] And he brings that down and he allows us
[46:17] to be a partaker of that book, of that
[46:20] promise, of that revelation of the open
[46:22] book, the revealed word, the secret made
[46:24] known. And now we can go to him to get
[46:27] the revelation of that and eat it.
[46:29] Listen, this has nothing to do with
[46:30] paper. It has nothing to do with
[46:31] chewing. This has nothing to do with
[46:32] your teeth.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; This is receiving the open word, the
[46:38] revealed mystery of God. And that's
[46:40] taking it into yourself and becoming one
[46:42] with it, receiving it. That's what
[46:44] eating this book is. And then he says,
[46:46] "Now you have to prophesy again."
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; So Christ did not take the book for
[46:53] himself. He took it for his family. But
[46:55] if you look at this instruction, neither
[46:58] did John take the book for himself.
[47:03] Now when he takes the book, he's to
[47:05] digest the contents of the book. And now
[47:08] he's to give out the revelation and the
[47:11] contents of the book because he's to
[47:12] prophesy again
[47:15] &gt;&gt; to many peoples and nations and tongues
[47:17] and kings. Amen. So that the book came
[47:20] back into man, redeemed man, fallen man
[47:24] who's been redeemed in the end time,
[47:26] who's been perfected by the washing of
[47:28] the water of the word, who's come to the
[47:29] full revelation of the word, who's come
[47:31] to the invisible union.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, I it's so important to realize
[47:37] that Christ will have for himself a
[47:39] bride without spot or wrinkle or any
[47:41] such thing. In order to do that, he had
[47:42] to wash her with the washing of the
[47:44] water of the word. That's why the
[47:45] prophet had to come and restore the word
[47:47] to wash the bride. to get a bride back
[47:49] in virgin condition so he could take the
[47:51] bride to himself. And in the invisible
[47:53] union of the bride, he can declare her
[47:56] worthy.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Worthy and virgin. He's only going to
[48:00] marry a virgin bride. And we're not
[48:02] virgin because of our deeds. We're
[48:03] virgin because he washed us by his word.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; He purified us by the word that was
[48:08] delivered through a prophet. And he
[48:10] cleansed the church so he could unify
[48:11] with the church. And now when he marries
[48:14] that church, he declares her righteous.
[48:17] Who's going to condemn his church?
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Who's going to condemn his wife? Who's
[48:21] going TO CALL HER BAD names and get say
[48:23] she's an adulteress? She's this or that.
[48:25] It's Christ himself who's taking her to
[48:26] herself. And when he takes her to
[48:28] herself in the union, he declares,
[48:30] "You're worthy. You're clean. You're
[48:33] pure." And something changed between
[48:35] Revelation 5 AND REVELATION 10. AND NOW
[48:38] JOHN SOMEHOW SOMEWAY HE'S able now to
[48:42] take the book that he wasn't able to
[48:44] touch. Something has happened in the end
[48:46] time SEQUENCE WHERE CHRIST HAS COME DOWN
[48:48] TO UNIFY WITH THE BRIDE. AND when he
[48:50] TAKES HER TO WIFE, WHO DARE CALL HER
[48:53] ANYTHING BUT PURE?
[48:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's his declaration of her.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what anybody else says.
[49:02] It's his declaration. And so now John
[49:05] takes the book. But John doesn't take
[49:07] the book just to go in a secret closet
[49:09] and feed on it by himself. He takes the
[49:12] book and he ingests the book. He becomes
[49:14] one with the book and catches the
[49:15] revelation of the mystery and then he's
[49:17] told to go and tell it everywhere.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; God is in this end time. Christ has come
[49:24] himself with the revelation, amen, of
[49:26] the mystery of God that was sealed
[49:28] behind seven seals, the seven thunders.
[49:30] And he he utterly sounded it through the
[49:32] preaching of the seven seals. He tore
[49:34] off the seals and showed us the hidden
[49:36] mystery underneath so that we could
[49:38] receive it and feed on it, become one
[49:40] with it so that we could go and tell it
[49:42] to everybody.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Christ didn't take the book for himself
[49:46] and neither do we take the book just for
[49:49] ourselves. We're here to share it.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; It was sealed up and locked up. But now,
[49:55] where is it? It's in her.
[49:59] It was sealed up and locked up and
[50:00] separated from man and sealed behind
[50:02] seven seals and in the hand of him that
[50:04] sits on the throne and kept away from
[50:05] man. And man was kept away from men. But
[50:07] in the end time when the lamb would step
[50:09] forward and take the book and loose the
[50:11] seals and bring the book down. Now what
[50:13] man had been separated from, he's been
[50:14] united back to.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; And now it's in her. It's in her. The
[50:21] revelation is in her. Amen. The mystery
[50:24] revealed is in her and she's to share
[50:26] it. Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Not just to keep it.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Revelation 19:10 says, "And I fell at
[50:33] his feet to worship him, and he said
[50:34] unto me, see thou do it not. I am thy
[50:36] fellow servant and of thy brethren that
[50:38] have the testimony of Jesus. Worship
[50:40] God. For the testimony of Jesus is the
[50:43] spirit of prophecy." So what is she
[50:45] supposed to do? Prophesy again. What's
[50:47] the spirit of prophecy? The testimony of
[50:49] Jesus.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And testimony is translated witness 15
[50:54] times. Testimony 14 record or report is
[50:58] testifying the office committed to
[51:00] profits of testifying concerning future
[51:02] events or what one testifies a testimony
[51:05] for example before a judge. Amen. It's
[51:08] our witness. And what are we here doing?
[51:09] We're witnessing of Jesus Christ. What
[51:11] are we witnessing of Jesus Christ? Amen.
[51:14] God has made us witnesses of something.
[51:17] Look, look at let's go back to John 17.
[51:21] He says in his prayer, sanctify them
[51:23] through thy truth. Thy word is truth. As
[51:25] thou has sent me into the world, even so
[51:27] have I also sent them into the world.
[51:29] And for their sakes I sanctify myself
[51:31] that they also might be sanctified
[51:33] through the truth. Neither pray I for
[51:35] these alone, but for th them also which
[51:38] shall believe on me through their word.
[51:41] He's saying, I'm not just praying for
[51:42] them, but now I've imparted unto them
[51:45] something. Amen. And on the day of
[51:47] Pentecost when they receive the Holy
[51:48] Ghost, he'll lead and guide them in all
[51:49] the truth. And he'll bring all that I've
[51:51] said back into their remembrance. Amen.
[51:53] is going to unlock the mystery to them
[51:55] and then they're going to go and spread
[51:56] it out. So, I'm not just praying for
[51:58] them, but I'm praying for everyone
[51:59] that'll believe through their words
[52:02] &gt;&gt; because I'm giving them the mystery
[52:04] secret. Amen. And now, they're going to
[52:06] take the mystery secret and they're
[52:08] going to give it out to everybody. And
[52:09] everybody who believes is going to be
[52:11] blessed under my prayer now because I'm
[52:13] not praying for them only, but I'm
[52:14] praying for everybody that will receive
[52:16] their words
[52:18] &gt;&gt; and believe.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the first church.
[52:25] Matthew 10:27.
[52:27] What I tell you in darkness that speak
[52:30] you in light and what you hear in the
[52:33] ear that preach you upon the housetops.
[52:36] I had a brother ask me one time, "If
[52:38] brother Brandham wasn't allowed to
[52:40] explain the third pool and explain the
[52:42] seventh seal, why is it that we do?"
[52:46] Is that right?
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Did the angel tell him, "Don't explain
[52:48] this."
[52:49] He said, "This is the third pool. You'll
[52:50] not explain to nobody." Why is it we
[52:52] through go through great extents
[52:54] explaining our revelation of the third
[52:56] pool and all that he said and tying
[52:57] together everything in the seven seal on
[52:59] what it all means? Because of this
[53:00] scripture right here. There was things
[53:02] Jesus couldn't say publicly. Amen. There
[53:05] was things he could only speak in
[53:06] parables. Amen. It wasn't for them to
[53:08] hear. And he would speak things behind
[53:10] closed doors to his disciples. Amen. And
[53:12] the Holy Ghost would remind them of all
[53:13] that he had taught them and lead them
[53:15] into all truth. And then they would go
[53:17] out and proclaim it everywhere.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz he told him, "What I tell you in
[53:21] darkness, speak ye in the light. What
[53:23] you hear in the ear, PREACH UPON THE
[53:25] HOUSETOPS." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM was not
[53:27] allowed to say it. In his lifetime while
[53:29] he was here, he said it in a roundabout
[53:31] way. He said it between the lines. Said,
[53:33] "I hope you're catching what the
[53:34] spirit's been trying to get over to YOU
[53:36] WITHOUT COMING RIGHT OUT and saying it."
[53:38] AMEN. HE COULDN'T COME OUT AND SAY IT.
[53:40] HE COULDN'T COME OUT AND EXPLAIN IT. BUT
[53:42] THAT WHICH GOD HAS REVEALED TO ME IN
[53:44] DARKNESS, AMEN. SPEAK IN THE LIGHT AND
[53:46] THAT WHICH YOU'VE HEARD IN THE EAR,
[53:47] PREACH ON THE HOUSETOPS BECAUSE WE'RE TO
[53:49] PROPHESY AGAIN.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother Bam couldn't do it, but he
[53:54] didn't say we couldn't do it.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; In Mark 16, he says,
[54:03] "Amen."
[54:05] Afterward, he appeared unto the 11 as
[54:07] they sat at meat and unbraided them with
[54:09] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[54:11] because they believed not them which had
[54:12] seen him after he was risen. And he said
[54:15] unto them, "Go you into all the world
[54:16] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[54:18] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[54:21] be saved, but he that believeth not
[54:23] shall be damned."
[54:26] You take the word and you go. And that
[54:28] word is salvation to those who obey it
[54:31] and believe it and follow it. Those who
[54:33] refuse it, it's damnation.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. What they were given to me, they
[54:38] were given something powerful, friends.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm looking for another
[54:43] scripture here.
[54:46] Uh
[54:49] yeah, right here.
[54:51] I want to read this one together. Luke
[54:53] 24:45.
[54:55] Then open he their understanding that
[54:57] they might understand the scriptures.
[54:59] Oh, praise God.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing to us all the
[55:02] time.
[55:04] He opened their understanding that they
[55:05] might understand the scriptures and said
[55:07] unto them, "Thus it is written, and thus
[55:09] it behooved Christ to suffer, and to
[55:11] rise from the dead the third day, and
[55:13] that repentance and remission of sins
[55:15] should be preached in his name among all
[55:17] nations, beginning at Jerusalem." And ye
[55:20] are witnesses of these things.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; They were witnesses of those things.
[55:25] They saw it. They were there. They saw
[55:27] his life. They saw his miracles. They
[55:29] saw the testimony. Amen. They they they
[55:31] saw it all. They saw the judgment, the
[55:33] crucifixion, the resurrection. They met
[55:35] him afterwards and he said, "You're
[55:37] witnesses of these things and you go off
[55:39] and you tell it. What I tell you in
[55:41] darkness, you reveal in the light. Well,
[55:42] you hear in the ear, preach it from the
[55:44] housetop. And I pray not just for you,
[55:46] but everyone who hears your words and
[55:48] believe." Amen. Is under a blessing. And
[55:50] you're witnesses of this. And and and
[55:53] Jesus is speaking to them of the
[55:55] dispensation of his dispensation of the
[55:59] crucifixion and the resurrection. And he
[56:01] says, "You're witnesses of these
[56:03] things."
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; But I tell you friends, they went
[56:06] faithfully and declared the witness of
[56:08] what they saw and heard and what they
[56:10] knew to be true and the dispensation
[56:12] that just taken place in their day
[56:13] because it transferred, amen, from
[56:15] Jerusalem, amen, to Christ, from the old
[56:18] temple worship unto the Jesus Christ,
[56:21] amen, being the sacrifice once and for
[56:23] all. And they saw the transition and
[56:25] they preached the transition and they
[56:26] come out preaching the new and living
[56:28] way. And they were witnesses of this.
[56:30] But I tell you, we're witnesses of
[56:32] something else. We're witnesses of the
[56:34] fullness of redemption. We can stand
[56:35] here this day and we've got a witness.
[56:38] And ye are witnesses OF THESE THINGS.
[56:40] WHAT THINGS? THE LAMB HAS TAKEN the
[56:42] book. THERE'S BEEN A MAN WHO'S BEEN ABLE
[56:44] TO BE the kinsman redeemer. He's
[56:46] fulfilled. AMEN. HIS ROLE. HE PLAYED THE
[56:49] ROLE OF INTERCESSION. AMEN. THROUGH THE
[56:51] DARKNESS OF THE SEVEN CHURCH ages while
[56:53] there was still a mystery on the word
[56:55] and men was MISUNDERSTANDING THE WORD.
[56:57] BUT AT THE END OF THAT, WHEN HE CAME
[56:58] FORTH TO REVEAL THE MYSTERY, HE STEPPED
[57:01] FORWARD, AMEN, TO TAKE THE BOOK, AMEN,
[57:04] AND TO BRING THE BOOK BACK TO EARTH OPEN
[57:06] AND UNVEILED. AND NOW IT'S AVAILABLE TO
[57:09] ANYONE WHO CAN GO TO THE ANGEL AND ASK
[57:12] FOR THE BOOK AND TAKE THE BOOK.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; And we are witnesses of these things.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
[57:22] AMEN. WITH SO MUCH WHAT'S CALLED GOSPEL
[57:24] PREACHING IN THIS DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN
[57:26] THE WRONG DISPENSATION. AMEN. THEY'RE
[57:28] GOING BACK. AMEN. WHERE THE APOSTLES
[57:30] WERE WITNESSES. There's not a thing
[57:32] wrong with any of that. BUT THE PROBLEM
[57:34] IS THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER DISPENSATIONAL
[57:36] CHANGE at the end time. AND WE ARE NOW
[57:39] TRANSITIONED FROM CHURCH AGES to end
[57:41] time. And in the end time, THERE WAS
[57:43] ANOTHER WORK FOR CHRIST to do. And it
[57:45] was fulfilling the role OF KINSMAN
[57:47] REDEEMER, JUDGING AT THE GATE AND TAKING
[57:50] BACK THE BOOK THAT ADAM LOST. AND WE
[57:52] LIVE IN THAT DAY AND WE'RE WITNESSES OF
[57:54] THESE THINGS.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; These are THE THINGS WE TESTIFY. THESE
[57:58] ARE THE THINGS WE WITNESS. This is what
[58:02] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT'S BRINGING LIFE TODAY.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY THAT
[58:08] BRINGS LIFE. THE DISPENSATION OF CHRIST.
[58:10] IT'S THE SAME JESUS CHRIST THAT PAID THE
[58:12] PRICE 2,000 YEARS AGO IS THE SAME ONE
[58:15] WHO TOOK THE BOOK IN OUR GENERATION. WHO
[58:17] LOOSED THE SEVEN SEALS AND BROUGHT IT
[58:19] DOWN TO MAN.
[58:22] AMEN.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; And ye are witnesses of these things.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; WHO ELSE IS GOING TO WITNESS IT? WHAT
[58:31] OTHER CHURCH AGE? WHAT OTHER
[58:32] DISPENSATION? WHO ELSE ON THE PLANET IS
[58:34] GOING TO WITNESS WHAT OUR DISPENSATION
[58:36] IS AND WHAT MONUMENTALLY SHIFTED IN 1963
[58:40] AND WHAT CHRIST IS DOING NOW. WHO'S
[58:42] GOING TO WITNESS IT? If you AND I DON'T
[58:45] EAT THE BOOK AND WITNESS AND PROPHESY
[58:47] AGAIN, THE WORLD IS STEEPED IN DARKNESS
[58:50] AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT CHRIST IS DOING
[58:51] TODAY. ALL THEY KNOW IS A HISTORICAL
[58:54] JESUS CHRIST. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW A
[58:55] PRESENT TENSE JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. WHO IS
[58:58] THE REDEEMER WHO BOUGHT BACK ALL THAT
[59:00] ADAM LOST. AND WHEN HE BOUGHT BACK ALL
[59:02] THAT ADAM LOST, HE GOT HIMSELF A GENTILE
[59:04] BRIDE. AND IN ORDER TO FINISH THE
[59:06] REDEMPTION, HE'S GOT TO TAKE THAT BRIDE.
[59:08] AMEN. AND HE'S GOT TO SEW HIS SEED INTO
[59:10] THAT BRIDE AND SHE'S GOT TO REPRODUCE
[59:12] THE SON OF MAN AGAIN.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T TESTIFY, WHO WILL?
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Luther's age COULDN'T DO IT. WESLEY'S
[59:22] AGE COULDN'T DO IT. THE LEODYSIAN AGE,
[59:24] THE PENTECOSTAL AGE COULDN'T DO IT.
[59:25] AMEN. WE CAN'T WAIT FOR SOMEBODY IN THE
[59:27] FUTURE TO DO IT. YE ARE WITNESSES OF
[59:29] THESE THINGS.
[59:32] What you have HEARD AND SEEN IN
[59:33] DARKNESS. AMEN. TESTIFY IN THE LIGHT.
[59:36] WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED TO YOU IN YOUR
[59:37] INNER EAR, AMEN, OF YOUR SOUL. SHOUT IT
[59:40] FROM THE HOUSETOPS. AMEN. BECAUSE WE'RE
[59:42] not looking back TO 2,000 YEARS AGO. BUT
[59:45] THERE'S A PRESENT TENSE MOVE OF GOD.
[59:47] THERE'S BEEN A DISPENSATIONAL CHANGE IN
[59:49] OUR GENERATION THAT'S BROUGHT US INTO A
[59:51] WHOLE ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; That's why this message is so important,
[1:00:00] friends. So many people get the wrong
[1:00:02] idea about the message and they fight
[1:00:03] against it and fight against the PROPHET
[1:00:05] AND THEY TRY TO TALK ABOUT NOW YOU KNOW
[1:00:07] THEY TRY TO ACT LIKE we're mean to the
[1:00:09] Baptist and mean to the Pentecostals.
[1:00:11] We're the only one who got it. They
[1:00:12] don't have anything. Listen that listen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Who else is going to testify of the
[1:00:19] truth?
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Who else can testify of the truth? Who
[1:00:24] else knows the truth?
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; This is not this is not diminishing
[1:00:30] anybody else or any role that they have
[1:00:32] to play in the kingdom of God and any
[1:00:34] other purpose that they have.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; But listen, the only thing they can do
[1:00:38] is look back to where he was.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; But who can declare where he is?
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Who can show the people where he is? And
[1:00:48] the way of salvation today, Amen. The
[1:00:51] way of salvation has never changed from
[1:00:53] the beginning of the book to the end.
[1:00:54] The way of salvation, healing,
[1:00:56] restoration has always to be received.
[1:00:58] The present tense I am God when he's
[1:01:01] presented to you in his I am state.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Everywhere God came in a present
[1:01:08] dispensation and salvation was to
[1:01:10] receive him when he came.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Nothing has changed now. So this is not
[1:01:15] any disregard for another human being or
[1:01:19] anybody who holds to a Christian faith
[1:01:21] or denomination. God blessed them and
[1:01:23] and and there can be a reward for them
[1:01:25] if they stay true to what they saw
[1:01:27] without disregarding the truth for the
[1:01:29] hour.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't change the fact that
[1:01:34] they cannot witness of this age.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; They are not witnesses of Christ in this
[1:01:43] age.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a mean saying. That doesn't
[1:01:47] mean any disrespect.
[1:01:50] But if you just only know a historical
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ,
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; listen, he's alive and well today.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And he's working today and he's done
[1:01:59] something today and it's significant.
[1:02:01] It's powerful and has everything to do
[1:02:03] with redemption. And that revelation is
[1:02:05] bringing us into rapturing faith. It's
[1:02:07] changing us.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; And so there's no disregard for another
[1:02:12] human. No disregard. I respect anybody
[1:02:15] who respects God's word.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Even if they can't see what I see, thank
[1:02:18] God. God bless them. Amen. God use them
[1:02:21] and God help them. Amen. Where they're
[1:02:23] at. But that doesn't change the fact
[1:02:25] that I'm not here to preach that kind of
[1:02:27] gospel. I am here to preach what I've
[1:02:29] been a witness of
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; and I've witnessed to the fact that my
[1:02:33] kinsman redeemer's taken the book and
[1:02:34] he's brought the back to earth. Amen.
[1:02:36] He's uniting with with mankind
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; with his bride.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. And amen. And
[1:02:46] amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; And amen.
[1:02:50] This is where we were. Go into all the
[1:02:53] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:02:54] creature. He that believeth and is
[1:02:56] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[1:02:57] believeth not shall be damned.
[1:03:01] The gospel is the good news.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; When they went when they went 2,000
[1:03:06] years ago and ran out, Amen. with the
[1:03:09] good news that Messiah has come and he
[1:03:12] paid the price of redemption. He died as
[1:03:13] a substitutionary offering and now we
[1:03:16] are saved through the shedding of his
[1:03:17] blood and we are reconciled back to God.
[1:03:20] That was good news. The greatest news,
[1:03:22] the best news that ever happened.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; But to tell the good news today doesn't
[1:03:28] mean I can only repeat the good news of
[1:03:30] yesterday.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; There is good news today. So good news
[1:03:34] today would be the gospel.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; So what is the gospel today? The gospel
[1:03:39] today is the one who came in flesh and
[1:03:42] died and paid the price of redemption
[1:03:44] and saved me by the shedding of blood.
[1:03:46] He has come to take back all that Adam
[1:03:48] lost. And in the end time, he's come now
[1:03:50] to bring the revelation of the whole
[1:03:52] plan of God back to man. And this is him
[1:03:56] marrying his bride, uniting as one with
[1:03:59] her. And now the truth is in her. The
[1:04:01] word is in
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; her.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And we are a witness of these things.
[1:04:10] Amen. So we are here to witness of those
[1:04:13] things.
[1:04:16] John 20:22.
[1:04:18] And we had said this, he breathed on
[1:04:20] them and saith unto them, receive you
[1:04:22] the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:24] Whosoever sins you remit, they are
[1:04:27] remitted unto them. And whosoever sins
[1:04:30] you retain, they are retained.
[1:04:33] Brother Brandon picks this up and
[1:04:34] explains to us how this works. We've
[1:04:37] been through it before, but I'd like to
[1:04:38] repeat it here. As in the marriage and
[1:04:41] divorce case the other day when the Holy
[1:04:42] Spirit had told me that I come and said
[1:04:44] it just the way he told me. Some
[1:04:46] minister lady gave me a right sharp ball
[1:04:48] little balling out. She said I guess you
[1:04:50] take the place of God. I said no ma'am.
[1:04:52] Said well you told them their sins is
[1:04:54] forgiven. Said where? Said only God has
[1:04:57] power. See another Pharisee.
[1:05:01] I said you see what's he referring to in
[1:05:03] this statement when he says only God has
[1:05:05] power. see another Pharisee. Because
[1:05:07] when Jesus looked at the woman who
[1:05:09] washed his feet and broke the alabaster
[1:05:11] box and washed him with her tears and
[1:05:12] dried him with hair, he says,"Simon, who
[1:05:15] was a Pharisee,
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; I have somewhat to say to you. This
[1:05:19] woman whose sins are many, Amen. All her
[1:05:22] sins are forgiven her."
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And in his heart, Simon thought, "Who is
[1:05:28] this that forgiveth sins? Only God can
[1:05:30] forgive sins." Yeah,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; that's what brother Bam's referring to
[1:05:36] that story.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus looks at the woman again and
[1:05:41] says, "Fear not.
[1:05:43] Thy faith has saved you."
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just Jesus saying, "I forgive
[1:05:51] you of all your sins." But what he was
[1:05:53] doing was recognizing the power of her
[1:05:55] faith in the present tense dispensation
[1:05:57] of God. And when she believed God made
[1:06:00] flesh, he said, "Your sins are all
[1:06:02] forgiven you based on what?" Faith.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Faith in what? FAITH IN THE PRESENT
[1:06:07] TENSE GOD STANDING BEFORE PRESENTING
[1:06:09] HIMSELF IN that dispensation.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM BRINGS IT right here.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; This woman said, "Well, you told them
[1:06:22] their sin is forgiven."
[1:06:24] SAID, "ONLY GOD HAS POWER." SEE, and we
[1:06:28] would have agreed with her.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, only God is." You can't
[1:06:36] just forgive people their sins. Only
[1:06:38] God. And we would have been, "Yeah,
[1:06:39] sister, you're right." But but brother
[1:06:41] Brennham said, "See another Pharisee."
[1:06:43] She missed it. She didn't get it. Amen.
[1:06:51] She said, "Oh, I want to explain this,
[1:06:54] friends. I don't want to I don't want
[1:06:56] you to miss it.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham was not listen I I I got
[1:07:01] to say this carefully. Brother Brenham
[1:07:03] as a man wasn't selecting people out and
[1:07:05] forgiving them of their sins.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; I forgive your sins. I forgive you. But
[1:07:09] when he come down and when he preached
[1:07:10] marriage and divorce, there was people
[1:07:12] all tanged up tangled up in wrong
[1:07:13] marriage situations. And he said he was
[1:07:16] interceding for them and God told him
[1:07:17] you can go down and tell them that I
[1:07:19] forgive you. It wasn't brother Benham.
[1:07:21] Amen. God told him, "You can say, "I
[1:07:23] forgive you, but don't you ever do it
[1:07:25] again." But Brother Brandham prefaced
[1:07:27] that statement.
[1:07:29] He said, "This is only to those that
[1:07:31] follow this message."
[1:07:34] Who are those that are following this
[1:07:36] message? Those that have faith in the
[1:07:38] present tense, Jesus Christ. And if
[1:07:41] you're in THAT POSITION, GOD can absolve
[1:07:44] you of your sin.
[1:07:46] And brother Brennan was given the
[1:07:48] permission to do that one time for that
[1:07:50] sin because of wrong teaching because of
[1:07:53] ministers and wrong teaching. They found
[1:07:55] themselves tangled up because of
[1:07:56] misunderstanding on the word. But he
[1:07:58] straightened the word out. And then he
[1:08:00] said, "But don't you ever do it again."
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; So this is what the woman is fussing at
[1:08:08] brother Brandham about that he come and
[1:08:10] told him what God told him he could say.
[1:08:12] Tell them their sins are forgiven. He
[1:08:13] said, "This isn't for everybody that's
[1:08:15] in a marriage and divorce situation.
[1:08:17] This isn't a blanket statement for
[1:08:19] everybody in the world. This is only for
[1:08:21] those who wash his feet. Break the
[1:08:23] alabaster box. Believe that Messiah is
[1:08:25] present. Believe that this message is
[1:08:27] Christ."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Said only God is. See another Pharisee.
[1:08:32] I said, "You see that you might know
[1:08:35] that Jesus told Peter and the apostles
[1:08:37] after he had the revelation of who he
[1:08:38] was, he told him, thou art Christ, the
[1:08:41] son of God."
[1:08:43] He said, ' Blessed art thou, son of
[1:08:44] Jonas. Flesh and blood never revealed
[1:08:46] this to you, but my father which is in
[1:08:47] heaven has revealed it. Upon this rock,
[1:08:50] I'll build my church. The gates of hell
[1:08:52] can't prevail against it. And I give
[1:08:54] unto thee the keys. Whatever you bind on
[1:08:56] earth, I'll bind it in heaven, and you
[1:08:58] loose on earth. That's the divine
[1:09:01] revelation of the word made flesh. You
[1:09:04] got it?
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; When that woman believed in Jesus
[1:09:09] Christ, all her sins were forgiven her.
[1:09:12] What was it? The divine revelation of
[1:09:14] the word made flesh. If it was flesh in
[1:09:16] that day by the son the groom, it is
[1:09:18] flesh today by the bride.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever sins you remit to them they
[1:09:23] are remitted. Whatsoever sins you retain
[1:09:25] to them they are retained. Now the
[1:09:28] Catholic church picked that up and takes
[1:09:30] it to their priest. But that's carnal.
[1:09:33] Watch. It was the spiritual revealed
[1:09:35] word.
[1:09:39] It was the spiritual revealed word that
[1:09:41] did it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; That's the reason he told them to go
[1:09:44] baptized in the name of father, son, and
[1:09:46] holy ghost. He knowed they knew who he
[1:09:49] was. Brother Bam now talks about this
[1:09:51] absolving of sin. Amen. And forgiveness
[1:09:53] of sin and and binding and loosing and
[1:09:56] retaining and loosing. AND HE TAKES IT
[1:09:59] ALL TO THE SPIRITUAL REVEALED WORD. And
[1:10:01] then then he says that's why he told
[1:10:04] them to baptize in the name of father,
[1:10:07] son, and the holy ghost.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; So why? So their sins could be absolved.
[1:10:15] So that's why he told them to baptize in
[1:10:17] father, son, and holy ghost. But when
[1:10:19] they baptized, they baptized in the name
[1:10:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because this has to do with
[1:10:25] absolving sins. This has to do with
[1:10:27] loosing and binding. Amen. And
[1:10:29] remitting. Amen. This is what THIS IS
[1:10:32] ALL ABOUT. THIS IS ABOUT FREEING PEOPLE
[1:10:34] FROM THEIR SINS. That's why he told them
[1:10:37] to baptize in the name of Father, Son,
[1:10:39] and Holy Ghost. You realize he didn't
[1:10:41] say, "Baptize in my name, Lord Jesus
[1:10:44] Christ." Because if he did, it would
[1:10:45] require no faith to take baptism in the
[1:10:48] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So,
[1:10:50] he said, "Baptize in the name of Father,
[1:10:52] Son, Holy Ghost." Cuz he knew, they knew
[1:10:54] who he was, and they could catch the
[1:10:56] revelation. And they caught the
[1:10:58] revelation of the word for their hour.
[1:10:59] And when they were baptized in his name,
[1:11:02] THEIR SINS WERE ABSOLVED, NOT BECAUSE OF
[1:11:04] THE WATER, BUT BECAUSE OF FAITH AND A
[1:11:06] PRESENT TENSE DISPENSATION OF JESUS
[1:11:08] CHRIST. THAT'S WHY THAT BAPTISM HAS BEEN
[1:11:11] RESTORED in this day.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; It's important. It matters. This is how
[1:11:23] Brother Bam's teaching the the the
[1:11:26] binding and the loosing of people and
[1:11:28] and the remitting, Amen. and the
[1:11:30] retaining of sins. He's not doing it by
[1:11:33] me saying my neighbor's forgiven and I
[1:11:35] my coworker and my son and my daughter.
[1:11:37] That's not what he's talking about. He's
[1:11:39] talking about preaching the revealed,
[1:11:41] spiritually revealed word for the day.
[1:11:43] And when somebody has faith in that and
[1:11:45] can receive that by revelation, amen,
[1:11:47] their sin, righteousness is imputed unto
[1:11:50] them and their sins are remitted from
[1:11:52] them and they are loosed.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; And if they reject it,
[1:12:01] you know what the scripture says?
[1:12:04] The Bible says, "And the spirit and the
[1:12:06] bride say, come and let him that heareth
[1:12:10] say, come and let him that is a thirst
[1:12:12] come. And whosoever will, let him take
[1:12:15] of the water of life freely.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brennham says on
[1:12:20] this. He says, "But thank God at this
[1:12:22] moment this age is not over. He is yet
[1:12:25] crying and his cry is not only in the
[1:12:27] spiritual ears of men by a spirit. But
[1:12:29] once again, a prophet is in the land.
[1:12:32] Once more God will reveal the truth as
[1:12:34] he did to Paul. In the days of the
[1:12:36] seventh messenger, in the days of the
[1:12:38] Leodysian age, its messenger will reveal
[1:12:40] the mysteries of God as revealed to
[1:12:42] Paul. He will speak out and those who
[1:12:45] receive that prophet in his own name
[1:12:47] will receive the beneficent beneficent
[1:12:50] effect of the prophet's ministry. And
[1:12:52] they that hear him will be blessed and
[1:12:53] become part of that bride of that last
[1:12:55] day, who are mentioned in Revelation
[1:12:57] 22:17.
[1:12:59] The spirit and the bride say, "Come."
[1:13:02] The corner wheat, the bridewheat that
[1:13:04] fell in the ground at Na has come back
[1:13:05] to original grain again. Praise God
[1:13:07] forever. Yes. Listen to the
[1:13:09] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:13:13] in the last age. What he says from God,
[1:13:15] the bride will say
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; because they're going to prophesy again.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; That means what's already been
[1:13:21] prophesied. The spirit and the prophet
[1:13:24] and the bride will be saying the same
[1:13:26] thing. And what they will what they will
[1:13:28] say will have already been said in the
[1:13:30] word. They are saying it now. come out
[1:13:32] from among her now and be ye separate.
[1:13:34] The cry has gone out. The cry is going
[1:13:37] out. How long will the voice cry? We do
[1:13:39] not know. But one thing we do know, it
[1:13:41] won't be long. For this is the last age.
[1:13:44] Amen. How many believe the cry is still
[1:13:45] going out? Absolutely. Because I'm still
[1:13:48] here crying it out, prophesying again,
[1:13:51] telling of those things that have been
[1:13:53] revealed.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam's referring to two
[1:13:56] scriptures here. First is 2 Corinthians
[1:13:58] 6:17. Wherefore come out from among them
[1:14:00] and be separate, sayith the Lord, and
[1:14:02] touch not the unclean thing, and I will
[1:14:04] receive you, and will be a father unto
[1:14:07] you, and you shall be my sons and
[1:14:08] daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
[1:14:11] There's a cry at the end time, come out.
[1:14:15] That's what the prophet and the spirit
[1:14:16] and bride are all saying things. They're
[1:14:18] saying, "Come out." Amen. And the
[1:14:20] prophet's cry in Revelation 18 was, and
[1:14:23] I had another voice from I heard another
[1:14:25] voice from heaven saying, "Come out of
[1:14:27] her, my people." Who's her? That's that
[1:14:29] Babylonian. Amen. Horish religious
[1:14:32] system and started the whole
[1:14:33] denominational system. And he's crying,
[1:14:35] "Come out of her, my people, that you be
[1:14:37] not partakers of her sins and you
[1:14:39] receive not of her plagues." What is the
[1:14:41] cry in the end time? The cry is, "Come
[1:14:45] out of her."
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Come out of religion. Come out of
[1:14:49] denomination. Amen. Come out of the
[1:14:51] systems of man. Come out and come where?
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Come to the river of the water of life.
[1:14:57] Amen. THAT'S FLOWING FREELY. COME BACK
[1:14:59] TO THE WORD. COME BACK TO THE LIFE. COME
[1:15:01] BACK TO CHRIST IN HIS FULLNESS.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Come to Christ. Leave the religion.
[1:15:07] Leave the denomination. Because in THE
[1:15:09] LEODYSIAN CHURCH AGE, CHRIST IS ON THE
[1:15:11] OUTSIDE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. HE WAS
[1:15:14] PUSHED OUT BECAUSE IN THE END TIME THEY
[1:15:16] wouldn't receive the word. NOW THE CALL
[1:15:18] IS COME OUT TO HIM. HE'S OUTSIDE THE
[1:15:21] CAMP. COME AND BE UNITED with him
[1:15:23] outside the camp. This is what we're
[1:15:25] crying. This is what we're preaching.
[1:15:27] This is the message.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Come out.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; WE'RE PROPHESYING AGAIN. HE'S NOT THERE.
[1:15:34] HE'S NOT WORKING THERE ANYMORE. THAT'S
[1:15:36] NOT WHERE HE'S REDEEMING HIS BRIDE. COME
[1:15:38] OUT OF THAT SYSTEM AND COME TO HIM. He
[1:15:40] is the spiritually revealed word. He is
[1:15:42] the kinsman redeemer. He is those seals.
[1:15:45] He is the opening of the seals. He is
[1:15:47] the mystery of God. He is the contents
[1:15:49] of the book and we are part of him.
[1:15:52] Amen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Who else is witnesses of these things?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Who else
[1:16:05] has the spiritually revealed word
[1:16:09] that'll loose somebody from their sins?
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Who else has the spiritually revealed
[1:16:17] word that will remit somebody's sins?
[1:16:23] It's a good question, isn't it?
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes we don't always deal with
[1:16:28] the significance of the message and the
[1:16:30] consequences of the message.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; There are consequences for this message.
[1:16:35] If this message is Christ, if it is the
[1:16:38] fulfillment of Revelations 10:7, if it
[1:16:40] is all of these things, there's
[1:16:42] consequences for that.
[1:16:44] God shut the door on denominations and
[1:16:47] opened a new and living way. It was the
[1:16:49] same thing that happened when he died on
[1:16:52] Calvary.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; It's just as significant, friends. There
[1:16:57] was a transition that took place when he
[1:16:59] died. And now they were offering lambs
[1:17:02] and they were offering goats and they
[1:17:03] were going through religious service and
[1:17:04] Moses told them how. And they were doing
[1:17:05] all that they were supposed to do. And
[1:17:07] God was redeeming through that. And he
[1:17:08] was covering their sins through that,
[1:17:09] waiting for the time that Christ would
[1:17:11] come. Amen. And after Christ came, Amen.
[1:17:14] After that sacrifice was made, he said,
[1:17:16] "Now, amen. It was no longer Jerusalem.
[1:17:18] It turned from that, the goats and the
[1:17:20] sheep. Now it turned to him, the lamb of
[1:17:22] God. Now he was the way of salvation.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; A door closed to one and a door opened
[1:17:28] to something else. Amen. And now the
[1:17:30] disciples ran out with this new and
[1:17:31] living way, with this gospel message,
[1:17:33] with this truth. And they were witnesses
[1:17:35] of it.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; But the same thing has happened now. Now
[1:17:39] he shut the door on denominations. No
[1:17:42] more time for denominations. And now he
[1:17:44] listen, brother Bam said it was a lamb.
[1:17:47] It was a lamb in Luther's day. It was a
[1:17:48] lamb in Wesley's day. What's he doing?
[1:17:50] He's showing the same thing that
[1:17:52] happened in Jerusalem at the time of
[1:17:54] Jesus sacrifice is happening now. God,
[1:17:57] amen, was playing a part of
[1:17:58] intercession, winking at their
[1:18:00] ignorance, go overcoming their ignorance
[1:18:02] because the full word wasn't revealed.
[1:18:04] But he's closed the door on that. He
[1:18:06] said it was the lamb in Luther's day. It
[1:18:08] was the lamb in Wesley's day. BUT NOW
[1:18:10] IT'S THE WORD. AMEN.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Christ the word and now the full
[1:18:14] revelation of the word that's been
[1:18:16] revealed in this message. THIS IS THE
[1:18:18] REQUIREMENT IN THIS HOUR TO UNITE WITH
[1:18:20] HIM.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; It's every bit as monumental a shift in
[1:18:26] redemption as it was 2,000 years ago.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That's the effect of the message.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; That's the consequences for the message.
[1:18:37] WHO ELSE HAS the spiritually revealed
[1:18:41] word that'll loose somebody from their
[1:18:42] sins and have their sins remitted?
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Who else has it? It's got to be those
[1:18:48] who will prophesy again.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, John didn't take the book for
[1:18:56] himself
[1:18:57] because the angel said, "When you eat
[1:18:59] that book, it's going to have an effect
[1:19:01] on you.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; When you're taking it in, it's going to
[1:19:05] be sweet as honey. You're going to enjoy
[1:19:06] every word of it. It's going to be life
[1:19:08] to you. But when you go to live it and
[1:19:10] you go to give it out, it's going to
[1:19:11] become bitterness
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; in your belly. When you digest and
[1:19:15] become one with, it's going to become
[1:19:16] bitterness in your belly cuz it'll be
[1:19:19] rejected and it'll cause changes in your
[1:19:21] life and it'll cause separation. It'll
[1:19:23] cause all of that. So, when you take it,
[1:19:25] it'll have an effect on you. But after
[1:19:27] the effect on you, what you need to do
[1:19:29] is prophesy again.
[1:19:34] It's a blessing to the world the bride
[1:19:37] is still here.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Not because she's special because of
[1:19:43] what she has.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Listen, we've got the inoculation.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; We've got the treatment.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; We've got the healing. We've got the
[1:19:55] bomb. We've got it.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; We've got the word. We've got the truth.
[1:19:58] We've got the revelation of the hour.
[1:20:00] We've got the mystery of Christ. We've
[1:20:02] got it.
[1:20:04] Hey, listen. The pharmacist is not
[1:20:06] special cuz they're a special person.
[1:20:08] They're just like you. But man, if
[1:20:10] they've got the healing treatment you
[1:20:12] need, they become special.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; You're glad they're there.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; You're glad that they're there. The
[1:20:18] dispensary is open and you go up and you
[1:20:21] need something and this will work and
[1:20:22] this will take away whatever your
[1:20:23] symptoms you're struggling with. and you
[1:20:25] go and you go to to Walgreens and it's
[1:20:27] closed and the door is locked and all of
[1:20:29] a sudden you're upset. You can't get
[1:20:30] what you need. Amen. When God takes this
[1:20:33] bride away, you can't get what you need
[1:20:36] anymore.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; And as long as the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:39] is here, she's got the bomb of Gilead.
[1:20:42] It's inside of her. She's prophesying
[1:20:44] again. She's giving it out. She's giving
[1:20:46] instructions. If you WANT THIS, GO BACK
[1:20:48] TO THE ONE who gave it to me. The mighty
[1:20:50] angels come with an open book in his
[1:20:52] hand. and he's inviting YOU TO COME TO
[1:20:54] HIM. I CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU. ALL I CAN
[1:20:56] DO IS PROPHESY AGAIN, BUT I CAN POINT TO
[1:20:59] him and you can go to him and he can
[1:21:00] give it to you.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And if YOU'LL RECEIVE THIS WORD and if
[1:21:04] you'll receive HIM IN HIS FULLNESS,
[1:21:06] AMEN, YOUR SINS WILL BE REMITTED.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; You'll be married to the lamb. AMEN. AND
[1:21:11] YOU'LL prophesy again.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, we're not just buying
[1:21:17] time to get out of here. We're not just
[1:21:19] going through motions every day when we
[1:21:21] go to work and we drive down the road
[1:21:22] and we GO TO THE MARKETPLACE. DON'T
[1:21:24] FORGET THE BOMB THAT you're have. You're
[1:21:26] a dispensary. You're a pharmacist and
[1:21:28] you've got the medicine. YOU'VE GOT THE
[1:21:30] INOCULATION. YOU'RE HOLDING IT. DON'T
[1:21:32] CLOSE YOUR DOORS. DON'T SHUT DOWN
[1:21:34] PREMATURELY. WE'RE NOT OUT of here yet.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are witnesses of these things.
[1:21:43] Brother Brandon says
[1:21:46] and the veil tradition of believers
[1:21:48] taken away. You see God when the veil of
[1:21:50] traditions has been removed you see that
[1:21:52] God is still God of his word. He still
[1:21:54] keeps his word. He is the God author of
[1:21:57] his word that is hid behind skin veils
[1:21:59] to others. Yes, that is right. To those
[1:22:01] who cannot go behind the veil, he is
[1:22:03] still behind skin veils. Notice when we
[1:22:06] become part of him as you are the veil
[1:22:08] that veils him. You are part of him as
[1:22:10] long as Christ is in you. As Christ was
[1:22:12] of God, because God was in him made him
[1:22:14] God. And as Christ is in you, the hope
[1:22:17] of glory, you become part of Christ. He
[1:22:20] that believeth on me, the works that I
[1:22:22] do shall he also. You become part of
[1:22:24] Christ as long as Christ is hid in you.
[1:22:27] Then it's veiled to the unbeliever. But
[1:22:29] you know he's in you. You are templing
[1:22:32] Christ that's behind the veil, the skin.
[1:22:35] Then we because of this veil, the veil
[1:22:37] again in human flesh hides God the word
[1:22:40] from the unbeliever.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Where is it? It's in earthn vessels.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to withhold it from
[1:22:49] anybody.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus said to his disciples, "He that
[1:22:53] receiveth you receiveth me, and he that
[1:22:56] receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
[1:22:59] He that receiveth a prophet in the name
[1:23:01] of a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[1:23:02] reward. And he that receiveth a
[1:23:04] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[1:23:06] man shall receive a righteous man's
[1:23:07] reward. And whosoever shall give to to
[1:23:10] drink unto one of these little ones a
[1:23:12] cup of cold water only in the name of a
[1:23:14] disciple, verily I say unto you, he
[1:23:16] shall no wise lose his reward.
[1:23:20] If you can receive God in the way that
[1:23:22] God presents himself, you can receive
[1:23:25] the reward.
[1:23:27] Amen.
[1:23:29] There's so much more I want to say. I
[1:23:31] just can't can't.
[1:23:35] The in Jehovah Dar says the book of
[1:23:37] Revelations, the Greek word apocalypse,
[1:23:40] it's apocalypsis, I think, which means
[1:23:43] the unveiling.
[1:23:45] The book of revelations is what? The
[1:23:47] unveiling.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; The unveiling of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of Jesus Christ. The
[1:23:53] unveiling of Jesus Christ. That's how it
[1:23:55] starts. Yeah. Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; But look at what he says. Taking a veil
[1:23:59] off of a statue is really what the Greek
[1:24:01] means by it. Taking the veil from a
[1:24:03] statue and letting the people see what's
[1:24:04] been made. And it is the revelation of
[1:24:08] Jesus Christ in his church.
[1:24:11] That's what the book of Revelation is
[1:24:13] all about. It's the unveiling of Jesus
[1:24:16] Christ. The unveiling of Jesus Christ
[1:24:18] where? In his church.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; It's great because it expresses what he
[1:24:23] is in each age. And you can see in the
[1:24:26] previous ages was just perfectly exactly
[1:24:28] and so is it in this age just what he
[1:24:32] is. What is the book of Revelations
[1:24:34] revealing? It unveils Jesus Christ in
[1:24:38] his church.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; That's what's being revealed to us in
[1:24:43] the end time. And now I want to leave
[1:24:45] you with just these two things, one
[1:24:46] quote and one scripture and we'll wrap
[1:24:48] it up. He died to reveal himself to us.
[1:24:52] Now let us die to self to reveal him to
[1:24:56] others.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Let us die to the traditions and things
[1:24:59] to reveal him to other. Die to the
[1:25:01] denominations to reveal him to others.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; In order for me to reveal him to others,
[1:25:07] I have to die to everything and come out
[1:25:09] of it all and be separated and come into
[1:25:12] newness of life and take his life in me
[1:25:14] and prophesy again. Amen. I have to die
[1:25:17] to everything I thought and thought was
[1:25:19] right.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. die to denominations, die
[1:25:23] to traditions, and die to self
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; so that I can reveal him to others.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; When we first come to this message, we
[1:25:33] were so excited that we heard the truth,
[1:25:36] so excited to know what the truth was,
[1:25:37] and then so excited to believe we were
[1:25:38] his bride,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; to believe we're part of this word and
[1:25:42] we're his bride. And then all of a
[1:25:43] sudden, it's so exciting to be bride,
[1:25:45] but then all of a sudden, we realize
[1:25:47] that has consequences, too.
[1:25:51] If if in the end time you get excited
[1:25:52] about a scripture that says the spirit
[1:25:54] and the bride say come. Praise God. I
[1:25:56] see myself in the scriptures. The spirit
[1:25:57] and the bride say come. Well, there's a
[1:25:59] responsibility that goes with that
[1:26:01] scripture.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Then the spirit and the bride have to be
[1:26:04] saying come.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to come? The message
[1:26:08] of COME IS COME OUT of
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; and COME INTO
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF DEATH. COME OUT OF DARKNESS.
[1:26:16] COME OUT OF DENOMINATIONS. Come out of
[1:26:18] RELIGIOUS TRADITION. COME OUT OF YOUR
[1:26:20] OWN UNDERSTANDING. COME OUT and come
[1:26:22] into come where? Come to the river of
[1:26:25] life.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Come to Christ. Come to the truth. Come
[1:26:28] to the fullness of the word. And that's
[1:26:31] our responsibility.
[1:26:33] Just say come. Come to light. Come to
[1:26:37] truth. Now I'm not of the opinion that
[1:26:40] you, you know, ram it down everybody's
[1:26:41] throat who stands still for 30 seconds.
[1:26:45] But we live a life. We demonstrate a
[1:26:46] life. We rub shoulders. You live a
[1:26:48] normal life and in course of life
[1:26:50] questions come up, doors open,
[1:26:52] opportunities come and I can be the
[1:26:55] nicest person in the world to somebody
[1:26:57] but my niceness is not going to give
[1:27:00] them redemption. It's going to take this
[1:27:02] word.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Them being nice to me might cause them
[1:27:08] to be able to enter into eternal life at
[1:27:10] the white throne judgment. I don't know.
[1:27:11] That might be a transfer that God
[1:27:13] allows. But for them to come to
[1:27:15] redemption and be part of this
[1:27:16] redemption plan and come back to where
[1:27:18] they've fallen from and come back to be
[1:27:20] bride if they're elect of God is going
[1:27:22] to take more than my niceness and my
[1:27:24] kindness. Amen. To bring them in. It's
[1:27:26] actually going to take prophesying
[1:27:28] again.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; It's going to take testifying of this
[1:27:32] message and what this message is because
[1:27:34] it's this message that brings
[1:27:35] redemption. It's this message that
[1:27:37] brings life. It's this message of Jesus
[1:27:39] Christ that is the river of life.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; It is life. It is Christ. It is true. It
[1:27:45] is the word.
[1:27:48] And then I want to leave you with this
[1:27:49] from 2 Corinthians 5:18.
[1:27:52] And all things are of God, who hath
[1:27:54] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:27:56] Christ, and hath given to us the
[1:27:58] ministry of reconciliation.
[1:28:01] To it that God was in Christ,
[1:28:03] reconciling the world unto himself, not
[1:28:04] imputing their trespasses unto them, and
[1:28:07] hath committed unto us the word of
[1:28:09] reconciliation.
[1:28:11] Now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[1:28:14] as though God did beseech you by us. How
[1:28:18] is God calling beseeching calling to
[1:28:20] them talking to them? How was God
[1:28:22] talking to them? By Paul
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; now how is God talking to them
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; how is God talking to your coworker? How
[1:28:30] is God talking to your family member?
[1:28:32] How's God talking to your neighbor? How
[1:28:33] is God going to beseech anybody that's
[1:28:35] near you?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; By us.
[1:28:41] That's easier to say
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; by us.
[1:28:45] We pray you in Christstead. We're in the
[1:28:49] place of Christ. I'm talking to you. I'm
[1:28:51] in Christstead. I pray you in
[1:28:54] Christstead. Be ye reconciled to God.
[1:28:58] For he hath made him to be sin for us
[1:29:00] who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:29:03] the righteousness of God in him. Amen.
[1:29:07] Let's stand together.
[1:29:10] Let's be ambassadors for Christ.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Let us beseech when we have the
[1:29:15] opportunity to beseech,
[1:29:18] to call out to somebody to come.
[1:29:22] Amen. God may give you many
[1:29:23] opportunities in many different ways,
[1:29:26] large and small, whatever open door,
[1:29:28] answering a question. There's all kinds
[1:29:30] of ways to talk to somebody. Amen. But
[1:29:32] we have to realize that what we carry is
[1:29:36] the word of reconciliation. Yeah.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; What we carry is the fullness of
[1:29:41] redemption and we are witnesses to it.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; What we carry is a truth that can have
[1:29:47] somebody's sins remitted.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Have somebody loosed from their sins.
[1:29:52] It's powerful, friends. This message is
[1:29:54] powerful. And I say, I want to be more
[1:29:57] conscious of that every day of my life.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I'm afraid I'm not conscious
[1:30:03] enough of it. But can you imagine
[1:30:06] sharing with somebody the true story of
[1:30:09] redemption who's never heard it?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; I mean, if you ask somebody if you're a
[1:30:14] Christian and say yes, that does not
[1:30:15] mean they know the story of redemption.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; That does not. You can talk to people
[1:30:21] all day long who's Christians and
[1:30:22] apparently this is a Christian cuh
[1:30:25] country and a Christian culture and we
[1:30:26] live in a conservative area and
[1:30:28] everybody, you know, everybody goes to
[1:30:30] church even if it's once a year and
[1:30:31] everybody's saved and everybody prays
[1:30:33] and everybody knows Christ. But the
[1:30:35] problem is they know nothing about the
[1:30:36] plan of redemption.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; And when you tell somebody that God
[1:30:41] didn't come to save you just so you can
[1:30:42] go to heaven and they look at you like,
[1:30:45] "What?" Hey, listen. That's a good
[1:30:47] that's a good conversation starter.
[1:30:49] But you realize we don't just listen.
[1:30:52] This message is not just repeating the
[1:30:55] same gospel story they've heard over and
[1:30:57] over and over. This is completely
[1:30:59] different.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; This is completely different. This is
[1:31:03] the why behind everything we've ever
[1:31:05] been taught.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Why virgin birth? Why Calvary? Why
[1:31:09] shedding of blood? Why redemption? Why
[1:31:11] is it called redemption? Why is it
[1:31:13] called reconciliation? Why is there a
[1:31:15] restoration? What is it all about?
[1:31:18] Why Eden? Why
[1:31:21] Why eating apples and then wearing
[1:31:23] aprons?
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Why eating fruit and getting a garment?
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have the truth that unlocks and
[1:31:33] unveils Christ to this generation.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; We have it. When the disciples left
[1:31:39] after after the upper room experience,
[1:31:42] Amen. After they saw Jesus ascend on
[1:31:44] high, they got the Holy Ghost. God
[1:31:46] unlocked the mysteries. Amen. Paul uh
[1:31:48] Peter comes out and saying this is that
[1:31:50] and this is that and this is that and
[1:31:52] now he can take what he's experienced
[1:31:53] and place it in the Bible and say this
[1:31:55] is prophecy fulfilled. And they go out
[1:31:57] and they start sharing amen what they've
[1:31:59] happened. They can't go back and retach
[1:32:02] the law and they can't go back and tell
[1:32:04] them to take a lamb and go to the a
[1:32:07] priest and and then you'll be absolved.
[1:32:08] They can't go backwards.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz it shifted.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; And we can't go backwards.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; All we can say is come to Christ.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; He's available.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's standing here unveiled
[1:32:24] wanting to unite with somebody. We can't
[1:32:25] go back to denominational teaching,
[1:32:27] denominational doctrine. We've got to
[1:32:29] come to the new dispensation. Amen.
[1:32:31] Christ is here.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's brought an open book.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And the open book is him.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And what's in the open book? My name
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; But the open book is a revelation of
[1:32:47] him.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; But in the open book is my name.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; But the book is him.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; But he is those seals that was revealed.
[1:32:55] But under the seals is a revelation of
[1:32:57] the mystery of God. But under theirs my
[1:33:01] name.
[1:33:03] Amen.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're part of it and we're looking
[1:33:06] for anybody else who's part of it.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. God bless
[1:33:12] you. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving. May
[1:33:14] the Lord give you rest. May he give you
[1:33:16] good times with your family. May you
[1:33:18] have a wonderful time. May you be
[1:33:21] refreshed in it. And may God help us.
[1:33:23] Amen. To be a witness
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; of this glorious message.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[1:33:31] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful,
[1:33:33] Father,
[1:33:35] that you have given us something far
[1:33:37] beyond stories,
[1:33:40] far beyond just history, Lord.
[1:33:44] It's the revelation that makes the
[1:33:46] history come alive.
[1:33:49] It's the revelation that makes the
[1:33:51] stories real.
[1:33:54] God, it's not a Sunday school teaching
[1:33:56] and it's not Lord just a denominational
[1:33:59] understanding, but you freed us from all
[1:34:01] of that and lifted us higher.
[1:34:04] You began to show us your great mystery
[1:34:07] that you held in yourself all this time.
[1:34:10] What you really wanted and what you were
[1:34:12] doing and why you were doing it and how
[1:34:15] you purchased it back and how you've
[1:34:17] redeemed it through seven ages and now
[1:34:19] what you're doing in the end time and
[1:34:21] where you're working and why and how.
[1:34:24] And God, we don't we know that in
[1:34:27] ourselves we're not worthy to take this
[1:34:29] book.
[1:34:31] We're not worthy, Lord, to to look at
[1:34:33] it, to read it, to know it. Lord, we're
[1:34:36] not worthy.
[1:34:37] But God, we believe you've made us
[1:34:39] worthy.
[1:34:40] You've called for us, Lord, to go take
[1:34:43] the book, God, I pray you'd help us come
[1:34:47] and Lord, come to you and receive this
[1:34:50] revelation from you where you open
[1:34:53] yourself and you reveal to us all that's
[1:34:56] been in your mind all of this time. What
[1:34:59] is the one goal you've had and the one
[1:35:01] purpose you've been trying to achieve
[1:35:03] all through the Bible? The thing that's
[1:35:05] been your heart's desire, your great
[1:35:07] masterpiece work. What have you been
[1:35:09] working on all this time? You've
[1:35:12] revealed it to us here at the end. And
[1:35:14] God, it's such a beautiful picture. It's
[1:35:16] such a wonderful revelation.
[1:35:19] God, help us to prophesy again.
[1:35:22] God, help us to take this to anybody
[1:35:24] with an ear to hear, a heart to
[1:35:27] understand. God, use our mouths, Lord.
[1:35:30] Use our lives as a witness. And Lord,
[1:35:32] use our testimony, Lord, to open doors
[1:35:34] and use our mouths to share this truth.
[1:35:37] For God, this is the greatest light that
[1:35:39] we've ever seen. This is such a
[1:35:41] wonderful truth in this hour. And God, I
[1:35:44] pray that we, Lord, who you have made
[1:35:47] worthy, may we come and receive this
[1:35:50] truth. And may we be willing, Lord, to
[1:35:53] bear the consequences of taking the book
[1:35:57] of the bitter belly, the rejection, the
[1:36:00] misunderstanding. May we be willing to
[1:36:02] do that so that somebody might find
[1:36:05] life.
[1:36:07] For Lord Jesus, you didn't take the book
[1:36:09] to keep it to yourself, but you shared
[1:36:11] it with us. And God, help us not to take
[1:36:13] the book to keep it to ourselves, but
[1:36:15] help us to follow your example and be
[1:36:18] willing to share the contents of that
[1:36:19] book with someone else. God, give us a
[1:36:23] talk to, Lord. Give us a witness on the
[1:36:25] inside. Use us, direct us, guide us.
[1:36:29] God, we don't want to mishandle your
[1:36:30] truths, and we don't want to be rough
[1:36:32] with people. We don't want to be rude,
[1:36:34] and we don't want to be arrogant. We
[1:36:36] don't want to do anything wrong with
[1:36:37] this precious word that's so valuable,
[1:36:39] so sweet, so precious.
[1:36:42] But God, if your Holy Spirit will guide
[1:36:43] us, Lord, I believe what we have is what
[1:36:45] this world needs. I believe what you've
[1:36:48] given us, Lord, is the finishing of
[1:36:50] redemption, the culmination of your
[1:36:52] plan, the finishing of your works in the
[1:36:55] gentile age. And God is so precious and
[1:36:58] it's so lovely and so sweet and so
[1:37:01] wonderful.
[1:37:03] I just want to share it with somebody
[1:37:04] else. Lord, I just want to I want this
[1:37:08] power that remits and this power that
[1:37:10] looses to go out to somebody else. And
[1:37:14] God, would you guide my feet and guide
[1:37:16] my eyes and guide my understanding and
[1:37:19] guide my mouth and just take me as a
[1:37:21] vessel in your hand and use me? Use me
[1:37:24] in every conversation and with everyone
[1:37:26] I talk to in any way that you can. Help
[1:37:28] me be sensitive to your leading, Lord,
[1:37:30] and not a bull, but Lord, just a a a a
[1:37:33] vessel in your hand, an instrument that
[1:37:35] you can use. For God, I want to witness
[1:37:38] of this that I've seen and that I've
[1:37:40] heard and that I know to be true. And
[1:37:43] God, I thank you that I have a voice and
[1:37:46] I'm on this earth at this time and
[1:37:47] you've given me the opportunity to stand
[1:37:49] for this truth, to proclaim it. Lord,
[1:37:52] it's the greatest privilege of my life
[1:37:55] is to be able to proclaim this truth
[1:37:57] with the vocal cords that you've given
[1:37:59] me. For it is the power of salvation in
[1:38:03] this hour. But we love you. We ask for
[1:38:06] your help, your guidance, your
[1:38:08] leadership. As we go out, Lord, with
[1:38:10] family and have fellowship and with
[1:38:13] friends, I pray that you'd use us as a
[1:38:15] light in this world. and may others use
[1:38:17] that light and find their passage to
[1:38:19] safe harbor, find themselves at your
[1:38:22] feet. Lord, we love you. We ask that you
[1:38:25] would bless us and help us and guide us
[1:38:27] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:38:31] Amen. God bless you all, brother John.
[1:38:34] For I will take you from the nations
[1:38:40] and will bring you to your own land.
[1:38:44] And I'll be sanctified
[1:38:47] in you
[1:38:49] before the eyes of man.
[1:38:54] And a new heart will I give you. And
[1:38:59] place my spirit within.
[1:39:03] I'll sprinkle
[1:39:05] clean water on you and save you from
[1:39:10] your sin.
[1:39:14] There is a fountain
[1:39:18] open in the house
[1:39:22] of David.
[1:39:25] you
[1:39:29] believe.
[1:39:32] And there are streams
[1:39:35] of grace that's flowing now
[1:39:40] from Calary
[1:39:43] gone
[1:39:45] now and
[1:39:47] receive.
[1:39:51] And I will pour
[1:39:54] upon the house
[1:39:56] of my chosen one the spirit of grace
[1:40:04] and oflication.
[1:40:11] And in
[1:40:12] that day,
[1:40:15] what a day that will be
[1:40:19] that a fountain
[1:40:22] will be opened up and you shall be holy
[1:40:27] clean.
[1:40:30] There is a fountain
[1:40:34] open in the house
[1:40:38] of David.
[1:40:40] to you
[1:40:45] believe.
[1:40:48] And there are streams
[1:40:51] of grace that's flowing down
[1:40:56] from Calary
[1:40:59] home
[1:41:00] now and
[1:41:03] receive.
[1:41:06] Amen. I just want to say I'm sorry. I
[1:41:09] fully intended to be less than an hour
[1:41:11] tonight. I know everybody's busy and got
[1:41:13] plans tomorrow, but my I love this word
[1:41:16] and I love you all and I love to
[1:41:17] proclaim it. And I just want to ask you
[1:41:20] a question.
[1:41:22] Amen. Christ took the book for us, but
[1:41:26] who are we taking the book for?
[1:41:29] Because when John took the book, he was
[1:41:31] told to prophesy again.
[1:41:34] Why don't we take it for our children?
[1:41:37] Why don't we take it for our spouses?
[1:41:40] Why don't we take it for our loved ones?
[1:41:42] Why don't we take it for our co-workers?
[1:41:43] Why don't we take it for somebody else
[1:41:45] in this world?
[1:41:47] Christ took it for us. He was worthy. We
[1:41:50] weren't worthy, but he took it not to
[1:41:52] keep for himself, but to share it with
[1:41:54] us so that we would have rapturing
[1:41:56] faith. So that we could have a change in
[1:41:58] the body. So that we would know him like
[1:42:01] we could never know him before.
[1:42:03] Then he told John to take the book and
[1:42:05] take it but prophesy to others
[1:42:09] kingdom kings and nations and tongues
[1:42:11] and peoples.
[1:42:13] So I don't want to just take the book
[1:42:15] for myself
[1:42:17] but I want to take it for somebody else.
[1:42:21] I want to take the book for my children.
[1:42:24] And I want to live the contents of the
[1:42:26] book before them. You want to share it
[1:42:28] with them so that they get hungry and
[1:42:31] they want to go to him and take the book
[1:42:33] too.
[1:42:35] I want to take the book for my wife. I
[1:42:37] want to take it for you all.
[1:42:40] Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Who are you going to take it for?
[1:42:45] Cuz you get an opportunity to prophesy
[1:42:48] again.
[1:42:50] Amen. And if you have it and you've
[1:42:52] taken it, it's part of you, then you've
[1:42:55] got something to give to somebody else
[1:42:58] with power and life and salvation and
[1:43:01] redemption.
[1:43:03] Amen. This message is so glorious, so
[1:43:06] beautiful, so powerful, so wonderful.
[1:43:10] Amen. We don't throw it like pearls
[1:43:12] before swine and cast it. But no, but
[1:43:15] every time we have a chance, it's a
[1:43:17] pearl that's dear to my heart. When
[1:43:19] somebody's willing to take it, I want to
[1:43:21] take it out. And I want to share it with
[1:43:23] them, too.
[1:43:25] I don't want to take the book just for
[1:43:26] me, but take it for you.
[1:43:30] All who will and whosoever will, let him
[1:43:33] come to the water of life and drink.
[1:43:38] Man, I think we have to stop thinking of
[1:43:40] the gospel so egocentrically.
[1:43:43] It's all about me. He saved me. He wants
[1:43:45] me. Redeemed me. I'm saved. I get a body
[1:43:47] change. I that's all true.
[1:43:50] But every time salvation and redemption
[1:43:53] comes, it turns the redeemed into a
[1:43:56] redeemer.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. John wasn't worthy to take the
[1:44:00] book, but Christ made him worthy. And
[1:44:01] when he became worthy, then he went and
[1:44:03] took the book. When he took the book,
[1:44:04] then he prophesied again.
[1:44:06] Christ has made us worthy to take this
[1:44:09] message, to feast on it, to eat it, to
[1:44:11] digest it, to be one with it. And
[1:44:12] because he made me worthy, now I want to
[1:44:15] go and give it to somebody else.
[1:44:18] Amen. Let's be conscious of taking the
[1:44:20] book, not for ourselves,
[1:44:22] but let's take it so that we have
[1:44:25] something of life, of eternal value to
[1:44:27] give to somebody else. Amen. God bless
[1:44:30] you all. Have a wonderful holiday. Amen.
[1:44:33] And I'm sorry,
[1:44:35] but I but I love you. Amen. Amen. God
[1:44:38] bless you, brother John.
[1:44:41] As I look back in history,
[1:44:45] I see a mighty God unveiled.
[1:44:50] He's proving
[1:44:52] over and over
[1:44:55] that his word will never fail.
[1:45:00] Oh, but I'm not not just dwelling
[1:45:05] on a past memory.
[1:45:11] Oh, it's the same God and he's living in
[1:45:18] me.
[1:45:21] And he's the same God.
[1:45:25] He spoke to
[1:45:27] the woman at the well.
[1:45:32] And he's the same God whose wonders
[1:45:37] are too many to tell.
[1:45:41] And the same God
[1:45:44] who parted
[1:45:46] the raging
[1:45:48] Red Sea.
[1:45:52] Yes, he's the same God
[1:45:56] and he's living in me.
[1:46:02] for the same God who created
[1:46:07] all the heavens,
[1:46:10] all the earth.
[1:46:12] Then he came back living in Jesus.
[1:46:17] There was power in his word.
[1:46:21] And now in these last days, I'm
[1:46:27] beginning
[1:46:28] to see
[1:46:32] that it's the same God and he's living
[1:46:38] in me.
[1:46:41] Yes, he's the same God
[1:46:45] who spoke to the woman at the well.
[1:46:52] Oh, he's the same God whose wonders
[1:46:57] are too many to tell.
[1:47:01] Oh, he's the same God who parted
[1:47:06] the raging red sea
[1:47:12] and is the same God and he's living
[1:47:18] in me.
[1:47:20] Oh, he's the same God. And he's the same
[1:47:24] God
[1:47:25] who spoke to
[1:47:28] the woman and the whale.
[1:47:32] And he's the same God
[1:47:35] whose wonders
[1:47:37] are too many
[1:47:39] to tell.
[1:47:42] He's the same God
[1:47:47] for the raging
[1:47:49] red sea
[1:47:53] and he's the same God and he's living
[1:47:59] in me. Go left.
[1:48:03] He's alive and well. He's living in me
[1:48:10] to tell
[1:48:12] the world.
[1:48:15] Oh, that he is the same.
[1:48:21] Oh, he's the same.
[1:48:24] Yesterday
[1:48:26] and today
[1:48:29] and forever.
[1:48:32] Jesus
[1:48:34] is alive
[1:48:36] and well.
[1:48:40] Oh, he's alive
[1:48:43] and well. All living in me
[1:48:48] to tell
[1:48:50] the world
[1:48:52] that he is the same.
[1:48:58] Glor is the same.
[1:49:04] And today
[1:49:06] and forever
[1:49:09] Jesus
[1:49:11] is alive
[1:49:13] and well.
[1:49:16] Oh, he's alive and well. And I am
[1:49:20] redeemed.
[1:49:22] And I'm bought with a price
[1:49:27] for Jesus
[1:49:30] has changed my whole life.
[1:49:36] And if anybody
[1:49:40] asks you
[1:49:42] just who I am,
[1:49:46] you can tell them, "Oh, that I am
[1:49:51] redeemed."
[1:49:55] And where
[1:49:58] there was hate, oh love now abides.
[1:50:05] way.
[1:50:07] There was confusion.
[1:50:10] Oh, peace now reigns.
[1:50:14] And I'm walking
[1:50:16] with Jesus.
[1:50:18] I'm a child of the King.
[1:50:23] And it's all because I am redeemed.
[1:50:32] Oh, I am redeemed.
[1:50:37] I'm bought with the Christ.
[1:50:42] And Jesus
[1:50:45] has changed my whole life.
[1:50:51] And if anybody
[1:50:54] asks you
[1:50:57] just who I am,
[1:51:00] you can tell them that I am redeemed.
[1:51:10] So I'll tell
[1:51:12] his favor
[1:51:14] and I'll tell of his love
[1:51:19] and I'll tell of
[1:51:22] his goodness
[1:51:24] to me.
[1:51:28] For he purchased
[1:51:30] my redemption
[1:51:33] with his preious blood
[1:51:37] and from sin
[1:51:40] he set me free.
[1:51:46] Oh I am redeemed.
[1:51:52] God with a price
[1:51:56] and Jesus
[1:51:58] has changed my whole life.
[1:52:05] And if anybody
[1:52:08] asks you
[1:52:10] just who I am,
[1:52:14] you can tell them that I am redeemed.
[1:52:23] Amen.
