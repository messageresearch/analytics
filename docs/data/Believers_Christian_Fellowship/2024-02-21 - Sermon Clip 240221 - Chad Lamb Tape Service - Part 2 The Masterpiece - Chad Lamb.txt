========================================

brother Benham he'll take an analogy and he just keeps breaking it down and using it in so many different ways he said Jesus Christ was the other half of the laundry ticket to the word to the promises so he when he fulfilled all the promises then he come to complete the word and the promises and when that connected back together that unlocked Redemption for you and I then he showed that out of him came the bride and now when they come back together when those two halv it's the completion of redemption to go back to Eden so he just keeps break he keeps working an analogy over and over so you don't stop and you're thinking it's only this am me he keeps using it but then he's going to take this analogy now of the diamond and The Cutting of a diamond because the diamond doesn't shine light until it cuts and he's going to show that we have to be cut by what by the word because only the right kind of tool can cut the diamond and so it reflects the light but then he's also going to use Christ the word is the diamond and the piece cut off what's the purpose of that and I thought this was interesting 105 the Masterpiece must be cut cut for what it's the piece cut off no the piece that's cut off is made of victrola needle now hold on stop here there's young people amongst us I got to stop for just a minute you may have been in a museum sometime and seen a vinyl record and they used to take this plastic vinyl record and they cut grooves in it and you'd put a little on a little plate and that plate had a motor and it would Spin and you would take a little needle and put a needle down and as that needle moved on those grooves it reproduced sound out of a speaker that's how we actually used to have music and stuff a long time ago I know it's blowing your mind now but we didn't have anything digital right but that little needle and originally they would use a piece of diamond on that that little victrola needle now listen to what he said that piece that's cut off it's made of a victrola needle and the victrola needle is put upon a record that's unseen music to the world but the needle is what brings it out brings out the true interpretation of the word do you believe you're a piece that's smitten off the great Diamond then what are we supposed to be doing we're supposed to be following the rhythm of the word and reproducing the word and manifestation amen this is the word this is the record that that has the grooves cut in it and nobody can read that and understand what it is you can look at all the grooves on a vinyl record and you can't make the music it's going to take the needle to replicate the sound amen and that's what all the pieces that are smitten off of that great Diamond we're here to be those needles that reproduce the what the true interpretation of the word what does it mean to be a church what does it mean to be modest what does it mean to be holy what does it mean to submit to the headship of the word what does it mean that's what we're here to play that record praise God oh I love that
