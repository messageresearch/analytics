Praise the Lord. Let's sing this together. Ever since Jesus saved and pardoned, I have been singing every day, I've never been sorry that I trusted his name.

Shining through me, through you, through our pastor, through one another, the word of God. Amen. Alive today. All host speak with tong of men and of angels. And oh, I prophesy and understand all. Although I have all faith, so mountains may be removed. Although I feed the poor and give up my life. If I have not charity, if love does not flow from me, I am nothing. Jesus reduced me to love. Love is patient and kind. Love is not envious, not proud, but gentle and meek, seeks not its own way. Love sings when Jesus prevails, believes and endures all things. Love hopes and bears every wrong. And love never fails. If I have not charity, if love does not flow from me, I am nothing. Jesus reduced me to love. One season when I was a child, I spoke and I thought as a child. But when I turn to amen, such ways put aside. &gt;&gt; And now we see through our glass, but then we shall see face to face. And now abide faith and hope. But the greatest is love. If I have not charity, if love does not flow from me, I am nothing. Jesus reduced me to love. love. If I have not charity, if love does not flow from me, I am nothing. Jesus, reduce me, Lord. Jesus, reduce me. Jesus reduced me to love. Wonderful, merciful savior, our precious redeemer and friend. Who would have thought that a lamb could rescue the souls of men? Oh, you rescue the souls of men. And you are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. You give the healing and praise. Our hearts always hunger for. Oh, our hearts always hunger for counselor, comforter, keeper, the spirit we long to embrace. Oh, you offer hope when our hearts hopelessly lost our way. Oh, and we've hopelessly lost our way. But you are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. You give thy healing and grace song. Hearts always hunger for. Oh, our hearts always hunger for. Amen. Are you still hungry for him? &gt;&gt; Amen. When we realize what he's done for us and how wonderful he is and how hopeless we were and all that he's done for us, how could we not love him more? &gt;&gt; How we not love him back when he first loved us? Amen. It's a privilege to be here with you tonight. Let's bow our heads together. Let's pray. Dear heavenly father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, that you have once again gathered us together. Lord, that you have drawn us by your drawing power. And God, we've come here to hear your word, to sing your praises, to meet with our brothers and sisters, to glorify your name. Now, we come to the part of the service, Lord, where we open our Bibles and we read your word, Lord. And God, it's going to take more than literacy, Lord, tonight. It's going to take a revelation from you to bring us into our position to open our eyes for us to see all that you want us to see this evening. Lord, I pray that you'd give us a fresh dose of the Isav. Give us ears to hear and a heart to perceive all you have. And may you take this vessel of mine under your complete control and take preeminence among all of us, both speaker and hear. And may you speak words of life and may they be received by your children. We love you, Lord. We ask you to take preeminence among us in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all this evening. Amen. If you want to take your Bibles, we'll turn to Ephesians while you're still standing. And I just want to give you an early happy Thanksgiving. Amen. Thanksgiving happens to be one of my favorite all-time holidays in the whole calendar year. And so I'm looking forward to spending some time with my family tomorrow and so thankful for all that God's done. Amen. Every year I'm more thankful than the year before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God continues to unveil himself and we have so much more to be thankful for. Amen. Also want to appreciate uh brother Benjamin, sister Amanda Seabolt for opening the home for those who don't have family in the area and don't have a place to gather. They're gathering there tomorrow. So may God bless them. And also I just want to ask you to remember sister Nancy Marorrow's family. I'm sure it's a little fresh just losing their mom and grandma right when they come into a holiday season. And I was thinking of the Golden family as well. They lost Sister Jan last year at this time. So I'm sure it's still hard for them. So as we gather, just remember those families as well. Amen. Also before we read, I want to remind you that this Sunday this week, I'll be down at Junction City. So ask you to remember to be praying for that. And Brother Gabe Smith will be ministering here. So keep him in prayer as well. Amen. So we look forward to that. Uh let's read Ephesians chapter 3 while we're in the book of Ephesians. Let's go to chapter 3. It's been a while since I've been with the saints down in Junction City, so I'm excited to go and see them. See how they're doing. So just keep us in prayer. And always they're predicting snow for Saturday night. Why not Friday? Why not Thursday? Why not get snowed in at Thanksgiving? But we just believe God God will work it all out. Amen. Every year when it comes around, I don't know why I'm so shocked. Every Wednesday and Saturday they call for snow. But praise God, God's good anyhow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14 says, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. Amen." God bless you. How many's happy to have that name? You can have your seats. Amen. God bless you. I'm happy to be part of that name. That's why I'm baptized in that name. That's why we pray in that name. That's why all that we do, both in word and deed, we do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. Because we recognize who he is to us. He's the head of the family. And he's the one who bought back uh the rights of redemption. Amen. God bless you, brother Jonathan. It's good to see you and your wife and your kids. It's good to have you guys here. and I appreciate that special with you and brother Daniel. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to turn to Colossians 2 while we have our Bibles handy. Let's go over to Colossians chapter 1. I'm going to read uh this portion here starting at verse 18. Colossians 1 and verse 18. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself, by him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven. And you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works. Yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. Amen. I'm so glad that he's reconciled us to himself in the body of Jesus Christ's flesh because God came. Amen. He made a body of flesh to dwell in and by that body he has reconciled us back to himself because there had to be a price paid for mankind. Amen. We were into this so deep on Sunday. It blessed me so much. I'm still feasting off the revelation from Sunday's service just to realize truly what God has done for us, friends. It means so much to me and and I want to go a little bit into that. I just want to uh talk about a little bit, maybe go uh a little different direction with it. But if we can bring the PowerPoint up, Brother Franco, I want to talk about carriers of the book. Amen. We were talking about the book on Sunday. When we look here at this reconciliation, he's reconciled all things into unto himself. Amen. And and he's reconciled us in the body of his flesh. And this word reconcile means to reconcile completely, to reconcile back again, bring back a former state of harmony. So what is he being trying to do? He's trying to take what's disharmonized and disjointed and he's trying to bring it back together again, back into harmony. Amen. And we know, amen, that man fell in the Garden of Eden and broke the harmony and fellowship with God and broke the harmony of God's purpose and plan. Amen. And now, amen, God has through Jesus Christ reconciled us back to himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So, it took a man and he was that man. And now, when we look at carriers of the book, I'm going to go back into Revelations 5 and we're just going to hit a few spots and move on. It says, "And I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals, and I saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice. Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?" And no man in heaven. Amen. Do you see this word man? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man, it had to be a man. No man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon. Amen. Adam was there. Amen. Because it looked it looked at no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth. Amen. That was all of them. &gt;&gt; That that encapsulated all men. And he looked at all men and there wasn't anybody worthy. And Adam was there. Of course, Adam wasn't worthy. Adam was worthy to hold the book at one point, but he lost his worthiness when he left the word. &gt;&gt; And now he could never reconcile himself back because now he's perverted. He's corrupted. And you can't you can't use a spotted lamb, amen, to bring back a reconciliation. It must be a perfect lamb. Amen. And so down through the Old Testament, there was no perfect lamb. There was no man. And there was no son of God that could fully obey all the word of God and walk in perfect righteousness and harmony with God that could take back that book that could buy back redemption that could pay for what Adam lost. Amen. So God came down and became that man himself. &gt;&gt; And he became a man. Amen. A real man who ate and SLEPT AND GOT TIRED. AMEN. A real man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not half man. Not an operation. Not a figure, but a man. And he became a man. A man whose toenails grew out. A man whose hair had to be cut. Amen. A man who got hungry and had to eat. He was a man. &gt;&gt; A man who could be beaten and feel the sting of pain. A man could be rejected. A man who could mourn. A man who could grief. A man who could weep at Lazarus's grave. A man who could be heartbroken. Amen. Over the the lack of belief and and lack of revelation amongst the people he came to save. A man that could weep over Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; A man that could feel. A man that could be touched. A MAN, AMEN, THAT COULD LAY DOWN IN THE BACK of a boat exhausted when the STORM BREAKS OUT. A MAN, &gt;&gt; he became a man. Amen. Because God, oh, praise God. God, Amen. gave this inheritance of this creation of this earth to a man. Amen. God, Amen. God wanted This is the inheritance of man. &gt;&gt; This is why I was talking about Sunday. Amen. I'm going to refer some back to that. But but but all my life I thought I was getting saved so I could go to heaven. Did anybody else believe that growing up in denominations? I mean maybe not even denominations, maybe in the message. I thought I was getting saved so I could go to heaven. Amen. And and my salvation didn't have anything with me going to heaven. &gt;&gt; That's not WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. THE reconciliation wasn't about going back to heaven. Amen. It was about reconciling what man had lost. And man had lost his right, amen, to rule the earth. He had lost his inheritance of the creation. And he had lost his fellowship with God. Amen. And now what Jesus Christ came to do WAS TO RESTORE BACK WHICH MAN LOST. AMEN. GOD, HE DIDN'T DIE SO THAT WE COULD GO to heaven. AMEN. HE DIED so he could reconcile all that was separated and lost from man so that man could eventually live as THE FAMILY OF GOD in the presence of God in fellowship with God in harmony WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THIS EARTH AS A GOD RACE ON THIS EARTH. &gt;&gt; That word salvation when I looked at the word salvation. Amen. I've heard it all my life and and I was getting saved and I was always needing to be saved and I grew up Pentecostal boy. So every time I made a mistake I had to get saved again. Amen. We were Armenian in our doctrine and and we had to every time you failed, you fell from grace and you had to get saved again. And I was being saved because I was lost. And and brother Brandham said, "You were never saved on any certain day. You were always saved." IF YOU'RE A CHILD OF GOD, a gene of God, an attribute from God, you can no more be lost than God can be got lost. YOU WERE IN FLESH in a lost condition &gt;&gt; and you were separated from fellowship, &gt;&gt; but your name was in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So this word salvation is the word soozo in the Greek and it means healing. &gt;&gt; So what happened? WE WERE SICK. &gt;&gt; WE WERE BROKEN. &gt;&gt; OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD NEEDED HEALED. OUR BODY NEEDED HEALED. AMEN. The earth needed healed. Everything needed healed. So what is salvation? Our salvation is a healing. Amen. What is healing? Hey, think about when you need healing. When you need healing, what's going on in your body? Something is wrong with you. And your healing WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE STATE YOU WERE IN BEFORE YOU got sick. This healing is TO BRING US BACK TO WHAT WE WERE BEFORE WE GOT SICK. BEFORE THE SI sin sickness hit us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S BRINGING US BACK. IT'S A RECONCILIATION. It's a restoration. It's a redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it had to be man. So, no nor no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much because no man was found worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They found men. There was men all over the but no man was found worthy because there was only one that was worthy and he was born without sin. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Romans chapter 8 together. Romans chapter 8. There's something about this subject that thrills my heart so much because it's taken the gospel message and it's taken what what churches and humanity and human thinking has diluted into just a story and it's brought it back into full force of its power. &gt;&gt; What Christ come really did and what it's all about and the impact that it has on everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I was saying I'm sorry. We need to read the scripture. I know, but but I just can't help it. Amen. We say, you know, uh heaven is not my destination. &gt;&gt; It's not my destination. Earth is. &gt;&gt; Our millennial reign, our honeymoon takes place on earth. Amen. Then the then the new city, the new Jerusalem descends upon the earth. Amen. A mountain rises and a city falls. This is symbolic of the two two different spheres, the heavenly sphere and the earthly sphere joining and uniting and whatever barrier separates them will be gone and we'll live as a family of God upon the earth. Amen. God as a family and fellowship together with no barrier of separation at all. Amen. And that's going to take place on this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think about uh if you think about when brother Benham went beyond the curtain of time, when he began the curtain of time, he met all these saints. They're they're in perfection. And they're in their youth. They're in theophony bodies. They're running on grass. Amen. They're they're they're fit. They're He said, "The most beautiful people you've ever seen, strong and handsome men and beautiful women." And running up to him, hugging, saying, "My precious brother." And he's in a place of perfection, beyond perfection, of love and only love. And sublime said, "By sublime." There's nothing he can describe it with. And he's so excited to get there. Amen. All of a sudden, Amen. He he he doesn't want to leave. He feels something stirring inside, a funny feeling. He turns and sees his body moving on the bed and he says, "I don't have to go back, do I?" &gt;&gt; That was his attitude having just arrived. But what was the attitude of all the saints that were in the sixth dimension? They were saying, "Hey, one day Christ will come and judge you for what you preach AND WE'LL GO BACK TO EARTH." &gt;&gt; THEY WEREN'T FINISHED WITH THEIR JOURNEY. SALVATION was more to them than just getting to heaven. THEY HAD ALREADY ARRIVED. IF HEAVEN WAS THE GOAL, THEY'VE GOT IT. BUT NO, THE GOAL WAS FAR BEYOND GOING TO HEAVEN, FAR BEYOND MOVING INTO PERFECTION, FAR BEYOND GOING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF perfect love. They're they were destined. They were predestinated. They were made. They were men. They were made to live on the earth and inhabit the earth and be a race of God men on the earth. And while they were in perfection, THEY WERE NOT FINISHED. AND THEY WERE LOOKING forward to something coming next. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. This message has unlocked the gospel, friends. &gt;&gt; Has brought the truth. It has unveiled Christ to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So much I want to say, but I got I want to move to other things, too. I want to say it all. I want to preach it all. I want to preach all night. I want to preach every day because this thing, this is what I love. &gt;&gt; This is who I am. This is touching something so deep inside of me. I can't explain it. I can't put it all together. But it's touching the core of who I am. This is what I was born for. This is what I was a thought in his mind for. This is what I've been destined for. This is what God when he thought of me as an attribute. However, he thought of me, he thought of me coming to this revelation, to this place, and for it to be manifest in me. &gt;&gt; I know that. In Romans 8:17 it says, "And if children then heirs, heirs of God and joint hes with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope. So now the earth is waiting for something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The creation the the the creature means the creation for the earnest expectation of the creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of God. Why is the creature Why is creation waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God? Because earth was meant to be ruled by sons of God. &gt;&gt; And when a son of God fell, earth fell. &gt;&gt; Everything under Adam fell. And this earth wants to go back to the condition it was in before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's waiting for the manifestation or the revealing or the unveiling of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity. Amen. And and and this word vanity is is weakness. and and frailty. Amen. It's broken. This creature, the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope. Amen. It wasn't the creation's fault. It was man's fault. &gt;&gt; But there's a hope. There's a hope of redemption. Verse 21. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. When the children of God go free, earth goes free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. This is why brother Brandham when he talks about the crucifixion at the day of crucifixion, he said there was an earthquake and the sun turned to black as sackcloth. Amen. And and and the mountains trembled and everything happened. And you know how brother Brandham describes the earthquake and the sun turning black? He says the sun hid its face behind its hands and wept for joy. &gt;&gt; And he said the earthquake, he says, was the hills skipping like rams upon the hills. Amen. What was he said the earth was a jumping and A SHOUTING. AMEN. BECAUSE of redemption. Because now there was a MAN WHO COULD BUY BACK WHAT ADAM LOST. And the earth was reacting to the redemption that was taking place at Calvary. And you would look at that and said, "That's terrible, an earthquake. OH, THE SUN WENT BLACK." AND THE EARTH is having a jubilee because now there's a man that's come TO PAY THE PRICE BECAUSE THE EARTH GOES FREE. When men go free, when men come BACK TO THEIR POSITION, THE EARTH COMES BACK TO ITS POSITION. &gt;&gt; OH, ONLY A PROPHET CAN TELL A STORY THAT WAY. ONLY A PROPHET COULD TELL US THE BLACKOUT OF THE SUN WAS THAT SON WEEPING be with his hands behind his face behind his head WEEPING FOR JOY AT REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; AND THE EARTHQUAKE WAS THE MOUNTAINS JUMPING UP AND DOWN BECAUSE WE'RE COMING BACK. WE'RE COMING BACK. WE'RE COMING BACK. THE EARTH DOESN'T WANT TO BE FALLEN. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS CYCLE OF DESTRUCTION AND HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES AND FIRES IS ALL ABOUT? AMEN. THIS EARTH IS ABOUT READY TO REJUVENATE ITSELF. IT WANTS TO COME BACK TO ITS POSITION. YES. &gt;&gt; And it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. That has to do with you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are linked to this earth. Our bodies are taken from this earth. Amen. God took a portion of this earth to redeem the rest of this earth. You're not going to separate the sons of God from earth. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. In the sixth seal, it says that's the reason John wept. Because if no one could get that book, all creation, everything was gone. She just simply turned back to atoms and molecules and so forth and cosmic light and not even be creation person, nothing else. Cuz Adam lost the rights of that book. He forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning instead of the word of God. So if John was weeping because nobody, no man could take the book. And he was weeping because he knew that all creation everything was gone. In the sixth seal again he says and there's a price and that's redemption. There's some price for redemption and there was nobody could do it. So he made his own laws of kinsman redeemer then they could find nobody. Every man was born of sex born after sexual desire. He was in the original sin Satan and Eve. So he could not do it. There's nothing in him. no holy pope, priest, doctor, divinity or whatever he might be. He was nobody worthy and he couldn't be an angel because it had to be a kinsman. He had to be a man. Then God himself became kinsman by taking on human flesh through the virgin birth and he shed his blood. Oh, I'm so thankful. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5. Now we're reading next right what after what we just read after John weeping. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, he took the book. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for the future. He took the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And what did he do with that book? He tore open the seals. &gt;&gt; He revealed the mystery of that book. Took the veil off of it so we would understand it. And then what did he do with the book? He brought it down to earth. &gt;&gt; You realize the title deed of all redemption, man's right to rule the earth. Amen. To be a god upon the earth. That does not belong in heaven. &gt;&gt; That book doesn't belong in heaven. The book went to heaven for safekeeping. So Satan couldn't get his hands on it. And it sat in the right hand of him that sit upon the throne. The original giver of the title deed. Who did he give the title deed to? He gave it to man. When man lost it so Satan wouldn't get it, it God takes it back himself. But he's waiting to give it to another man. And when he gives it to the man, it's the man Christ Jesus. And when the man Christ Jesus is found worthy to take the book, he takes the book. And what does he do with the book? He brings it back to earth cuz the book belongs on earth. &gt;&gt; I love this. It's so simple. It's so amazing. It's so beautiful. It's so everything all together. So he brings it back to earth as an open book in his hand and and he roars as a lion roars and seven thunders utter their voices. And and then we know, amen, that's to be sealed up till the time of the end. But in the end, we would know those seven thunders. And then the mystery of God would be finished. And then we go to Revelation 10:8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said, "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth." Brother Benham said when that mighty angel come down in 101 with an open book, he said the same book that was sealed and closed in Revelation chapter 5, which is the book of redemption, &gt;&gt; which is the title deed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the marriage certificate, &gt;&gt; which is the word, &gt;&gt; which is everything. Amen. And I went unto the angel, and I said unto him, give me the little book. And he said unto me, "Take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey." And look at this. And I took the little book. &gt;&gt; This is remarkable. This is John who's not worthy. He's not worthy. &gt;&gt; That was ESTABLISHED IN CHAPTER 5. No man in heaven, no man on earth, no man under the earth was found worthy, amen, to take the book, to look on it, to to touch it, to read it. No man. AND JOHN WAS THERE. He wasn't worthy. He couldn't touch it. He couldn't look at it. He couldn't look on. He couldn't read it. Amen. He couldn't take it. What's he doing taking the book? Amen. Because the worthy one took it and brought it down for the whole family. &gt;&gt; He did it for all of us. Amen. He didn't take it to keep it to himself. Amen. Re realize GOD GAVE this book to his son and Adam was supposed to bring forth the contents of the book which is the family of God. And when he hybridized himself, he failed and he could no longer bring forth the contents of the book in perfection. Amen. Now it would come forth in a perverted way. Amen. Through hybridization. SO GOD TOOK BACK THAT BOOK waiting to give it back to somebody. But he wanted to give it to his children. He wanted to give it to his sons and daughters. He wanted to give it to his offspring that would become flesh and live upon the earth. Amen. So he just holds it waiting for one. None's worthy. So he becomes that one. And he does it for his whole family. That's why when Jesus went ON THE CROSS, I WAS IN HIM THEN because God came TO BECOME THE WHOLE family in one man. And that one man represented the entire family as the headship of the family. So I was included in there because he's the head of the family and THE FULLNESS OF GOD. THE GOD HAD DWELT IN HIM BODILY. SO ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE POURED INTO CHRIST. EVERYTHING, ALL THE CONTENTS OF THAT BOOK WAS IN HIM. &gt;&gt; Because what are the believers? The words on the book. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO NOW HE PURCHASED BACK, AMEN. BY THE SHEDDING of his blood. AMEN. HE PURCHASED BACK THE BOOK. HE PURCHASED BACK CREATION. PURCHASE BACK the right to take the book. But when he takes the book, Amen. Now God did this. He he he become man. He became flesh. She became a man to become the head of the family so that he could take the book back for the whole family. &gt;&gt; GOD DID THIS FOR US. &gt;&gt; NOT THAT HE WOULD do it, AMEN. THAT THAT CHRIST WOULD keep it for himself, BUT HE BROUGHT IT DOWN because we're joint hes with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he brings the open BOOK AND NOW JOHN is a type of the bride. JOHN COMES TO HIM. AMEN. because a voice of heaven tells him to go to the mighty angel and take the book. And he says, "I want the book." And he says, "Take the book. THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO you when you take it." And then it says, "AND I TOOK THE BOOK." NOW THE UNWORTHY ONE TOOK THE BOOK. AMEN. BECAUSE HE COMES to the worthy one who was able TO TAKE THE BOOK. And the worthy one gives him the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he declared him worthy. &gt;&gt; And if he declared him worthy, then he's worthy. Amen. And I took the book out of the angel's hand, and I ate it up, and it was in my mouth, sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." This is what I really want to bring to you this evening just in a short message is he takes the book but he doesn't take it for himself. &gt;&gt; He takes it for the whole family. &gt;&gt; Then he brings it down and gives access to the family that's alive on earth at the time which is the end time bride. &gt;&gt; And he gives access to that book to us which is the revelation of the mystery of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's secret plan that he had in his mind all along. And he brings that down and he allows us to be a partaker of that book, of that promise, of that revelation of the open book, the revealed word, the secret made known. And now we can go to him to get the revelation of that and eat it. Listen, this has nothing to do with paper. It has nothing to do with chewing. This has nothing to do with your teeth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is receiving the open word, the revealed mystery of God. And that's taking it into yourself and becoming one with it, receiving it. That's what eating this book is. And then he says, "Now you have to prophesy again." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Christ did not take the book for himself. He took it for his family. But if you look at this instruction, neither did John take the book for himself. Now when he takes the book, he's to digest the contents of the book. And now he's to give out the revelation and the contents of the book because he's to prophesy again &gt;&gt; to many peoples and nations and tongues and kings. Amen. So that the book came back into man, redeemed man, fallen man who's been redeemed in the end time, who's been perfected by the washing of the water of the word, who's come to the full revelation of the word, who's come to the invisible union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, I it's so important to realize that Christ will have for himself a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. In order to do that, he had to wash her with the washing of the water of the word. That's why the prophet had to come and restore the word to wash the bride. to get a bride back in virgin condition so he could take the bride to himself. And in the invisible union of the bride, he can declare her worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Worthy and virgin. He's only going to marry a virgin bride. And we're not virgin because of our deeds. We're virgin because he washed us by his word. &gt;&gt; He purified us by the word that was delivered through a prophet. And he cleansed the church so he could unify with the church. And now when he marries that church, he declares her righteous. Who's going to condemn his church? &gt;&gt; Who's going to condemn his wife? Who's going TO CALL HER BAD names and get say she's an adulteress? She's this or that. It's Christ himself who's taking her to herself. And when he takes her to herself in the union, he declares, "You're worthy. You're clean. You're pure." And something changed between Revelation 5 AND REVELATION 10. AND NOW JOHN SOMEHOW SOMEWAY HE'S able now to take the book that he wasn't able to touch. Something has happened in the end time SEQUENCE WHERE CHRIST HAS COME DOWN TO UNIFY WITH THE BRIDE. AND when he TAKES HER TO WIFE, WHO DARE CALL HER ANYTHING BUT PURE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's his declaration of her. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what anybody else says. It's his declaration. And so now John takes the book. But John doesn't take the book just to go in a secret closet and feed on it by himself. He takes the book and he ingests the book. He becomes one with the book and catches the revelation of the mystery and then he's told to go and tell it everywhere. &gt;&gt; God is in this end time. Christ has come himself with the revelation, amen, of the mystery of God that was sealed behind seven seals, the seven thunders. And he he utterly sounded it through the preaching of the seven seals. He tore off the seals and showed us the hidden mystery underneath so that we could receive it and feed on it, become one with it so that we could go and tell it to everybody. &gt;&gt; Christ didn't take the book for himself and neither do we take the book just for ourselves. We're here to share it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was sealed up and locked up. But now, where is it? It's in her. It was sealed up and locked up and separated from man and sealed behind seven seals and in the hand of him that sits on the throne and kept away from man. And man was kept away from men. But in the end time when the lamb would step forward and take the book and loose the seals and bring the book down. Now what man had been separated from, he's been united back to. &gt;&gt; And now it's in her. It's in her. The revelation is in her. Amen. The mystery revealed is in her and she's to share it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just to keep it. &gt;&gt; Revelation 19:10 says, "And I fell at his feet to worship him, and he said unto me, see thou do it not. I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." So what is she supposed to do? Prophesy again. What's the spirit of prophecy? The testimony of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And testimony is translated witness 15 times. Testimony 14 record or report is testifying the office committed to profits of testifying concerning future events or what one testifies a testimony for example before a judge. Amen. It's our witness. And what are we here doing? We're witnessing of Jesus Christ. What are we witnessing of Jesus Christ? Amen. God has made us witnesses of something. Look, look at let's go back to John 17. He says in his prayer, sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth. As thou has sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for th them also which shall believe on me through their word. He's saying, I'm not just praying for them, but now I've imparted unto them something. Amen. And on the day of Pentecost when they receive the Holy Ghost, he'll lead and guide them in all the truth. And he'll bring all that I've said back into their remembrance. Amen. is going to unlock the mystery to them and then they're going to go and spread it out. So, I'm not just praying for them, but I'm praying for everyone that'll believe through their words &gt;&gt; because I'm giving them the mystery secret. Amen. And now, they're going to take the mystery secret and they're going to give it out to everybody. And everybody who believes is going to be blessed under my prayer now because I'm not praying for them only, but I'm praying for everybody that will receive their words &gt;&gt; and believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the first church. Matthew 10:27. What I tell you in darkness that speak you in light and what you hear in the ear that preach you upon the housetops. I had a brother ask me one time, "If brother Brandham wasn't allowed to explain the third pool and explain the seventh seal, why is it that we do?" Is that right? &gt;&gt; Did the angel tell him, "Don't explain this." He said, "This is the third pool. You'll not explain to nobody." Why is it we through go through great extents explaining our revelation of the third pool and all that he said and tying together everything in the seven seal on what it all means? Because of this scripture right here. There was things Jesus couldn't say publicly. Amen. There was things he could only speak in parables. Amen. It wasn't for them to hear. And he would speak things behind closed doors to his disciples. Amen. And the Holy Ghost would remind them of all that he had taught them and lead them into all truth. And then they would go out and proclaim it everywhere. &gt;&gt; Cuz he told him, "What I tell you in darkness, speak ye in the light. What you hear in the ear, PREACH UPON THE HOUSETOPS." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM was not allowed to say it. In his lifetime while he was here, he said it in a roundabout way. He said it between the lines. Said, "I hope you're catching what the spirit's been trying to get over to YOU WITHOUT COMING RIGHT OUT and saying it." AMEN. HE COULDN'T COME OUT AND SAY IT. HE COULDN'T COME OUT AND EXPLAIN IT. BUT THAT WHICH GOD HAS REVEALED TO ME IN DARKNESS, AMEN. SPEAK IN THE LIGHT AND THAT WHICH YOU'VE HEARD IN THE EAR, PREACH ON THE HOUSETOPS BECAUSE WE'RE TO PROPHESY AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother Bam couldn't do it, but he didn't say we couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Mark 16, he says, "Amen." Afterward, he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and unbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. And he said unto them, "Go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned." You take the word and you go. And that word is salvation to those who obey it and believe it and follow it. Those who refuse it, it's damnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. What they were given to me, they were given something powerful, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm looking for another scripture here. Uh yeah, right here. I want to read this one together. Luke 24:45. Then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing to us all the time. He opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them, "Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." And ye are witnesses of these things. &gt;&gt; They were witnesses of those things. They saw it. They were there. They saw his life. They saw his miracles. They saw the testimony. Amen. They they they saw it all. They saw the judgment, the crucifixion, the resurrection. They met him afterwards and he said, "You're witnesses of these things and you go off and you tell it. What I tell you in darkness, you reveal in the light. Well, you hear in the ear, preach it from the housetop. And I pray not just for you, but everyone who hears your words and believe." Amen. Is under a blessing. And you're witnesses of this. And and and Jesus is speaking to them of the dispensation of his dispensation of the crucifixion and the resurrection. And he says, "You're witnesses of these things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I tell you friends, they went faithfully and declared the witness of what they saw and heard and what they knew to be true and the dispensation that just taken place in their day because it transferred, amen, from Jerusalem, amen, to Christ, from the old temple worship unto the Jesus Christ, amen, being the sacrifice once and for all. And they saw the transition and they preached the transition and they come out preaching the new and living way. And they were witnesses of this. But I tell you, we're witnesses of something else. We're witnesses of the fullness of redemption. We can stand here this day and we've got a witness. And ye are witnesses OF THESE THINGS. WHAT THINGS? THE LAMB HAS TAKEN the book. THERE'S BEEN A MAN WHO'S BEEN ABLE TO BE the kinsman redeemer. He's fulfilled. AMEN. HIS ROLE. HE PLAYED THE ROLE OF INTERCESSION. AMEN. THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF THE SEVEN CHURCH ages while there was still a mystery on the word and men was MISUNDERSTANDING THE WORD. BUT AT THE END OF THAT, WHEN HE CAME FORTH TO REVEAL THE MYSTERY, HE STEPPED FORWARD, AMEN, TO TAKE THE BOOK, AMEN, AND TO BRING THE BOOK BACK TO EARTH OPEN AND UNVEILED. AND NOW IT'S AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN GO TO THE ANGEL AND ASK FOR THE BOOK AND TAKE THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; And we are witnesses of these things. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM, AMEN. WITH SO MUCH WHAT'S CALLED GOSPEL PREACHING IN THIS DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE WRONG DISPENSATION. AMEN. THEY'RE GOING BACK. AMEN. WHERE THE APOSTLES WERE WITNESSES. There's not a thing wrong with any of that. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER DISPENSATIONAL CHANGE at the end time. AND WE ARE NOW TRANSITIONED FROM CHURCH AGES to end time. And in the end time, THERE WAS ANOTHER WORK FOR CHRIST to do. And it was fulfilling the role OF KINSMAN REDEEMER, JUDGING AT THE GATE AND TAKING BACK THE BOOK THAT ADAM LOST. AND WE LIVE IN THAT DAY AND WE'RE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; These are THE THINGS WE TESTIFY. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE WITNESS. This is what &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT'S BRINGING LIFE TODAY. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY THAT BRINGS LIFE. THE DISPENSATION OF CHRIST. IT'S THE SAME JESUS CHRIST THAT PAID THE PRICE 2,000 YEARS AGO IS THE SAME ONE WHO TOOK THE BOOK IN OUR GENERATION. WHO LOOSED THE SEVEN SEALS AND BROUGHT IT DOWN TO MAN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And ye are witnesses of these things. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHO ELSE IS GOING TO WITNESS IT? WHAT OTHER CHURCH AGE? WHAT OTHER DISPENSATION? WHO ELSE ON THE PLANET IS GOING TO WITNESS WHAT OUR DISPENSATION IS AND WHAT MONUMENTALLY SHIFTED IN 1963 AND WHAT CHRIST IS DOING NOW. WHO'S GOING TO WITNESS IT? If you AND I DON'T EAT THE BOOK AND WITNESS AND PROPHESY AGAIN, THE WORLD IS STEEPED IN DARKNESS AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT CHRIST IS DOING TODAY. ALL THEY KNOW IS A HISTORICAL JESUS CHRIST. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW A PRESENT TENSE JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. WHO IS THE REDEEMER WHO BOUGHT BACK ALL THAT ADAM LOST. AND WHEN HE BOUGHT BACK ALL THAT ADAM LOST, HE GOT HIMSELF A GENTILE BRIDE. AND IN ORDER TO FINISH THE REDEMPTION, HE'S GOT TO TAKE THAT BRIDE. AMEN. AND HE'S GOT TO SEW HIS SEED INTO THAT BRIDE AND SHE'S GOT TO REPRODUCE THE SON OF MAN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T TESTIFY, WHO WILL? &gt;&gt; Luther's age COULDN'T DO IT. WESLEY'S AGE COULDN'T DO IT. THE LEODYSIAN AGE, THE PENTECOSTAL AGE COULDN'T DO IT. AMEN. WE CAN'T WAIT FOR SOMEBODY IN THE FUTURE TO DO IT. YE ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS. What you have HEARD AND SEEN IN DARKNESS. AMEN. TESTIFY IN THE LIGHT. WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED TO YOU IN YOUR INNER EAR, AMEN, OF YOUR SOUL. SHOUT IT FROM THE HOUSETOPS. AMEN. BECAUSE WE'RE not looking back TO 2,000 YEARS AGO. BUT THERE'S A PRESENT TENSE MOVE OF GOD. THERE'S BEEN A DISPENSATIONAL CHANGE IN OUR GENERATION THAT'S BROUGHT US INTO A WHOLE ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST. &gt;&gt; That's why this message is so important, friends. So many people get the wrong idea about the message and they fight against it and fight against the PROPHET AND THEY TRY TO TALK ABOUT NOW YOU KNOW THEY TRY TO ACT LIKE we're mean to the Baptist and mean to the Pentecostals. We're the only one who got it. They don't have anything. Listen that listen. &gt;&gt; Who else is going to testify of the truth? &gt;&gt; Who else can testify of the truth? Who else knows the truth? Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not this is not diminishing anybody else or any role that they have to play in the kingdom of God and any other purpose that they have. &gt;&gt; But listen, the only thing they can do is look back to where he was. &gt;&gt; But who can declare where he is? &gt;&gt; Who can show the people where he is? And the way of salvation today, Amen. The way of salvation has never changed from the beginning of the book to the end. The way of salvation, healing, restoration has always to be received. The present tense I am God when he's presented to you in his I am state. &gt;&gt; Everywhere God came in a present dispensation and salvation was to receive him when he came. &gt;&gt; Nothing has changed now. So this is not any disregard for another human being or anybody who holds to a Christian faith or denomination. God blessed them and and and there can be a reward for them if they stay true to what they saw without disregarding the truth for the hour. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't change the fact that they cannot witness of this age. &gt;&gt; They are not witnesses of Christ in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a mean saying. That doesn't mean any disrespect. But if you just only know a historical Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; listen, he's alive and well today. &gt;&gt; And he's working today and he's done something today and it's significant. It's powerful and has everything to do with redemption. And that revelation is bringing us into rapturing faith. It's changing us. &gt;&gt; And so there's no disregard for another human. No disregard. I respect anybody who respects God's word. &gt;&gt; Even if they can't see what I see, thank God. God bless them. Amen. God use them and God help them. Amen. Where they're at. But that doesn't change the fact that I'm not here to preach that kind of gospel. I am here to preach what I've been a witness of &gt;&gt; and I've witnessed to the fact that my kinsman redeemer's taken the book and he's brought the back to earth. Amen. He's uniting with with mankind &gt;&gt; with his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. And amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. This is where we were. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. The gospel is the good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they went when they went 2,000 years ago and ran out, Amen. with the good news that Messiah has come and he paid the price of redemption. He died as a substitutionary offering and now we are saved through the shedding of his blood and we are reconciled back to God. That was good news. The greatest news, the best news that ever happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to tell the good news today doesn't mean I can only repeat the good news of yesterday. &gt;&gt; There is good news today. So good news today would be the gospel. &gt;&gt; So what is the gospel today? The gospel today is the one who came in flesh and died and paid the price of redemption and saved me by the shedding of blood. He has come to take back all that Adam lost. And in the end time, he's come now to bring the revelation of the whole plan of God back to man. And this is him marrying his bride, uniting as one with her. And now the truth is in her. The word is in &gt;&gt; her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we are a witness of these things. Amen. So we are here to witness of those things. John 20:22. And we had said this, he breathed on them and saith unto them, receive you the Holy Ghost. Whosoever sins you remit, they are remitted unto them. And whosoever sins you retain, they are retained. Brother Brandon picks this up and explains to us how this works. We've been through it before, but I'd like to repeat it here. As in the marriage and divorce case the other day when the Holy Spirit had told me that I come and said it just the way he told me. Some minister lady gave me a right sharp ball little balling out. She said I guess you take the place of God. I said no ma'am. Said well you told them their sins is forgiven. Said where? Said only God has power. See another Pharisee. I said you see what's he referring to in this statement when he says only God has power. see another Pharisee. Because when Jesus looked at the woman who washed his feet and broke the alabaster box and washed him with her tears and dried him with hair, he says,"Simon, who was a Pharisee, &gt;&gt; I have somewhat to say to you. This woman whose sins are many, Amen. All her sins are forgiven her." &gt;&gt; And in his heart, Simon thought, "Who is this that forgiveth sins? Only God can forgive sins." Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what brother Bam's referring to that story. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus looks at the woman again and says, "Fear not. Thy faith has saved you." &gt;&gt; It wasn't just Jesus saying, "I forgive you of all your sins." But what he was doing was recognizing the power of her faith in the present tense dispensation of God. And when she believed God made flesh, he said, "Your sins are all forgiven you based on what?" Faith. &gt;&gt; Faith in what? FAITH IN THE PRESENT TENSE GOD STANDING BEFORE PRESENTING HIMSELF IN that dispensation. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM BRINGS IT right here. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; This woman said, "Well, you told them their sin is forgiven." SAID, "ONLY GOD HAS POWER." SEE, and we would have agreed with her. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, only God is." You can't just forgive people their sins. Only God. And we would have been, "Yeah, sister, you're right." But but brother Brennham said, "See another Pharisee." She missed it. She didn't get it. Amen. She said, "Oh, I want to explain this, friends. I don't want to I don't want you to miss it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham was not listen I I I got to say this carefully. Brother Brenham as a man wasn't selecting people out and forgiving them of their sins. &gt;&gt; I forgive your sins. I forgive you. But when he come down and when he preached marriage and divorce, there was people all tanged up tangled up in wrong marriage situations. And he said he was interceding for them and God told him you can go down and tell them that I forgive you. It wasn't brother Benham. Amen. God told him, "You can say, "I forgive you, but don't you ever do it again." But Brother Brandham prefaced that statement. He said, "This is only to those that follow this message." Who are those that are following this message? Those that have faith in the present tense, Jesus Christ. And if you're in THAT POSITION, GOD can absolve you of your sin. And brother Brennan was given the permission to do that one time for that sin because of wrong teaching because of ministers and wrong teaching. They found themselves tangled up because of misunderstanding on the word. But he straightened the word out. And then he said, "But don't you ever do it again." &gt;&gt; So this is what the woman is fussing at brother Brandham about that he come and told him what God told him he could say. Tell them their sins are forgiven. He said, "This isn't for everybody that's in a marriage and divorce situation. This isn't a blanket statement for everybody in the world. This is only for those who wash his feet. Break the alabaster box. Believe that Messiah is present. Believe that this message is Christ." &gt;&gt; Said only God is. See another Pharisee. I said, "You see that you might know that Jesus told Peter and the apostles after he had the revelation of who he was, he told him, thou art Christ, the son of God." He said, ' Blessed art thou, son of Jonas. Flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed it. Upon this rock, I'll build my church. The gates of hell can't prevail against it. And I give unto thee the keys. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind it in heaven, and you loose on earth. That's the divine revelation of the word made flesh. You got it? &gt;&gt; When that woman believed in Jesus Christ, all her sins were forgiven her. What was it? The divine revelation of the word made flesh. If it was flesh in that day by the son the groom, it is flesh today by the bride. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever sins you remit to them they are remitted. Whatsoever sins you retain to them they are retained. Now the Catholic church picked that up and takes it to their priest. But that's carnal. Watch. It was the spiritual revealed word. It was the spiritual revealed word that did it. &gt;&gt; That's the reason he told them to go baptized in the name of father, son, and holy ghost. He knowed they knew who he was. Brother Bam now talks about this absolving of sin. Amen. And forgiveness of sin and and binding and loosing and retaining and loosing. AND HE TAKES IT ALL TO THE SPIRITUAL REVEALED WORD. And then then he says that's why he told them to baptize in the name of father, son, and the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; So why? So their sins could be absolved. So that's why he told them to baptize in father, son, and holy ghost. But when they baptized, they baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because this has to do with absolving sins. This has to do with loosing and binding. Amen. And remitting. Amen. This is what THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THIS IS ABOUT FREEING PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS. That's why he told them to baptize in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. You realize he didn't say, "Baptize in my name, Lord Jesus Christ." Because if he did, it would require no faith to take baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So, he said, "Baptize in the name of Father, Son, Holy Ghost." Cuz he knew, they knew who he was, and they could catch the revelation. And they caught the revelation of the word for their hour. And when they were baptized in his name, THEIR SINS WERE ABSOLVED, NOT BECAUSE OF THE WATER, BUT BECAUSE OF FAITH AND A PRESENT TENSE DISPENSATION OF JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHY THAT BAPTISM HAS BEEN RESTORED in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's important. It matters. This is how Brother Bam's teaching the the the binding and the loosing of people and and the remitting, Amen. and the retaining of sins. He's not doing it by me saying my neighbor's forgiven and I my coworker and my son and my daughter. That's not what he's talking about. He's talking about preaching the revealed, spiritually revealed word for the day. And when somebody has faith in that and can receive that by revelation, amen, their sin, righteousness is imputed unto them and their sins are remitted from them and they are loosed. &gt;&gt; And if they reject it, you know what the scripture says? The Bible says, "And the spirit and the bride say, come and let him that heareth say, come and let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brennham says on this. He says, "But thank God at this moment this age is not over. He is yet crying and his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by a spirit. But once again, a prophet is in the land. Once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul. In the days of the seventh messenger, in the days of the Leodysian age, its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul. He will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficent beneficent effect of the prophet's ministry. And they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of that last day, who are mentioned in Revelation 22:17. The spirit and the bride say, "Come." The corner wheat, the bridewheat that fell in the ground at Na has come back to original grain again. Praise God forever. Yes. Listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in the last age. What he says from God, the bride will say &gt;&gt; because they're going to prophesy again. &gt;&gt; That means what's already been prophesied. The spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing. And what they will what they will say will have already been said in the word. They are saying it now. come out from among her now and be ye separate. The cry has gone out. The cry is going out. How long will the voice cry? We do not know. But one thing we do know, it won't be long. For this is the last age. Amen. How many believe the cry is still going out? Absolutely. Because I'm still here crying it out, prophesying again, telling of those things that have been revealed. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam's referring to two scriptures here. First is 2 Corinthians 6:17. Wherefore come out from among them and be separate, sayith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. There's a cry at the end time, come out. That's what the prophet and the spirit and bride are all saying things. They're saying, "Come out." Amen. And the prophet's cry in Revelation 18 was, and I had another voice from I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people." Who's her? That's that Babylonian. Amen. Horish religious system and started the whole denominational system. And he's crying, "Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins and you receive not of her plagues." What is the cry in the end time? The cry is, "Come out of her." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come out of religion. Come out of denomination. Amen. Come out of the systems of man. Come out and come where? &gt;&gt; Come to the river of the water of life. Amen. THAT'S FLOWING FREELY. COME BACK TO THE WORD. COME BACK TO THE LIFE. COME BACK TO CHRIST IN HIS FULLNESS. &gt;&gt; Come to Christ. Leave the religion. Leave the denomination. Because in THE LEODYSIAN CHURCH AGE, CHRIST IS ON THE OUTSIDE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. HE WAS PUSHED OUT BECAUSE IN THE END TIME THEY wouldn't receive the word. NOW THE CALL IS COME OUT TO HIM. HE'S OUTSIDE THE CAMP. COME AND BE UNITED with him outside the camp. This is what we're crying. This is what we're preaching. This is the message. &gt;&gt; Come out. &gt;&gt; WE'RE PROPHESYING AGAIN. HE'S NOT THERE. HE'S NOT WORKING THERE ANYMORE. THAT'S NOT WHERE HE'S REDEEMING HIS BRIDE. COME OUT OF THAT SYSTEM AND COME TO HIM. He is the spiritually revealed word. He is the kinsman redeemer. He is those seals. He is the opening of the seals. He is the mystery of God. He is the contents of the book and we are part of him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who else is witnesses of these things? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who else has the spiritually revealed word that'll loose somebody from their sins? &gt;&gt; Who else has the spiritually revealed word that will remit somebody's sins? It's a good question, isn't it? &gt;&gt; See, sometimes we don't always deal with the significance of the message and the consequences of the message. &gt;&gt; There are consequences for this message. If this message is Christ, if it is the fulfillment of Revelations 10:7, if it is all of these things, there's consequences for that. God shut the door on denominations and opened a new and living way. It was the same thing that happened when he died on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's just as significant, friends. There was a transition that took place when he died. And now they were offering lambs and they were offering goats and they were going through religious service and Moses told them how. And they were doing all that they were supposed to do. And God was redeeming through that. And he was covering their sins through that, waiting for the time that Christ would come. Amen. And after Christ came, Amen. After that sacrifice was made, he said, "Now, amen. It was no longer Jerusalem. It turned from that, the goats and the sheep. Now it turned to him, the lamb of God. Now he was the way of salvation. &gt;&gt; A door closed to one and a door opened to something else. Amen. And now the disciples ran out with this new and living way, with this gospel message, with this truth. And they were witnesses of it. &gt;&gt; But the same thing has happened now. Now he shut the door on denominations. No more time for denominations. And now he listen, brother Bam said it was a lamb. It was a lamb in Luther's day. It was a lamb in Wesley's day. What's he doing? He's showing the same thing that happened in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus sacrifice is happening now. God, amen, was playing a part of intercession, winking at their ignorance, go overcoming their ignorance because the full word wasn't revealed. But he's closed the door on that. He said it was the lamb in Luther's day. It was the lamb in Wesley's day. BUT NOW IT'S THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Christ the word and now the full revelation of the word that's been revealed in this message. THIS IS THE REQUIREMENT IN THIS HOUR TO UNITE WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's every bit as monumental a shift in redemption as it was 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; That's the effect of the message. &gt;&gt; That's the consequences for the message. WHO ELSE HAS the spiritually revealed word that'll loose somebody from their sins and have their sins remitted? &gt;&gt; Who else has it? It's got to be those who will prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Listen, John didn't take the book for himself because the angel said, "When you eat that book, it's going to have an effect on you. &gt;&gt; When you're taking it in, it's going to be sweet as honey. You're going to enjoy every word of it. It's going to be life to you. But when you go to live it and you go to give it out, it's going to become bitterness &gt;&gt; in your belly. When you digest and become one with, it's going to become bitterness in your belly cuz it'll be rejected and it'll cause changes in your life and it'll cause separation. It'll cause all of that. So, when you take it, it'll have an effect on you. But after the effect on you, what you need to do is prophesy again. It's a blessing to the world the bride is still here. &gt;&gt; Not because she's special because of what she has. &gt;&gt; Listen, we've got the inoculation. &gt;&gt; We've got the treatment. &gt;&gt; We've got the healing. We've got the bomb. We've got it. &gt;&gt; We've got the word. We've got the truth. We've got the revelation of the hour. We've got the mystery of Christ. We've got it. Hey, listen. The pharmacist is not special cuz they're a special person. They're just like you. But man, if they've got the healing treatment you need, they become special. &gt;&gt; You're glad they're there. &gt;&gt; You're glad that they're there. The dispensary is open and you go up and you need something and this will work and this will take away whatever your symptoms you're struggling with. and you go and you go to to Walgreens and it's closed and the door is locked and all of a sudden you're upset. You can't get what you need. Amen. When God takes this bride away, you can't get what you need anymore. &gt;&gt; And as long as the bride of Jesus Christ is here, she's got the bomb of Gilead. It's inside of her. She's prophesying again. She's giving it out. She's giving instructions. If you WANT THIS, GO BACK TO THE ONE who gave it to me. The mighty angels come with an open book in his hand. and he's inviting YOU TO COME TO HIM. I CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU. ALL I CAN DO IS PROPHESY AGAIN, BUT I CAN POINT TO him and you can go to him and he can give it to you. &gt;&gt; And if YOU'LL RECEIVE THIS WORD and if you'll receive HIM IN HIS FULLNESS, AMEN, YOUR SINS WILL BE REMITTED. &gt;&gt; You'll be married to the lamb. AMEN. AND YOU'LL prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, we're not just buying time to get out of here. We're not just going through motions every day when we go to work and we drive down the road and we GO TO THE MARKETPLACE. DON'T FORGET THE BOMB THAT you're have. You're a dispensary. You're a pharmacist and you've got the medicine. YOU'VE GOT THE INOCULATION. YOU'RE HOLDING IT. DON'T CLOSE YOUR DOORS. DON'T SHUT DOWN PREMATURELY. WE'RE NOT OUT of here yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are witnesses of these things. Brother Brandon says and the veil tradition of believers taken away. You see God when the veil of traditions has been removed you see that God is still God of his word. He still keeps his word. He is the God author of his word that is hid behind skin veils to others. Yes, that is right. To those who cannot go behind the veil, he is still behind skin veils. Notice when we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him. You are part of him as long as Christ is in you. As Christ was of God, because God was in him made him God. And as Christ is in you, the hope of glory, you become part of Christ. He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he also. You become part of Christ as long as Christ is hid in you. Then it's veiled to the unbeliever. But you know he's in you. You are templing Christ that's behind the veil, the skin. Then we because of this veil, the veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Where is it? It's in earthn vessels. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to withhold it from anybody. &gt;&gt; Jesus said to his disciples, "He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall no wise lose his reward. If you can receive God in the way that God presents himself, you can receive the reward. Amen. There's so much more I want to say. I just can't can't. The in Jehovah Dar says the book of Revelations, the Greek word apocalypse, it's apocalypsis, I think, which means the unveiling. The book of revelations is what? The unveiling. &gt;&gt; The unveiling of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of Jesus Christ. The unveiling of Jesus Christ. That's how it starts. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But look at what he says. Taking a veil off of a statue is really what the Greek means by it. Taking the veil from a statue and letting the people see what's been made. And it is the revelation of Jesus Christ in his church. That's what the book of Revelation is all about. It's the unveiling of Jesus Christ. The unveiling of Jesus Christ where? In his church. &gt;&gt; It's great because it expresses what he is in each age. And you can see in the previous ages was just perfectly exactly and so is it in this age just what he is. What is the book of Revelations revealing? It unveils Jesus Christ in his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what's being revealed to us in the end time. And now I want to leave you with just these two things, one quote and one scripture and we'll wrap it up. He died to reveal himself to us. Now let us die to self to reveal him to others. &gt;&gt; Let us die to the traditions and things to reveal him to other. Die to the denominations to reveal him to others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for me to reveal him to others, I have to die to everything and come out of it all and be separated and come into newness of life and take his life in me and prophesy again. Amen. I have to die to everything I thought and thought was right. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. die to denominations, die to traditions, and die to self &gt;&gt; so that I can reveal him to others. &gt;&gt; When we first come to this message, we were so excited that we heard the truth, so excited to know what the truth was, and then so excited to believe we were his bride, &gt;&gt; to believe we're part of this word and we're his bride. And then all of a sudden, it's so exciting to be bride, but then all of a sudden, we realize that has consequences, too. If if in the end time you get excited about a scripture that says the spirit and the bride say come. Praise God. I see myself in the scriptures. The spirit and the bride say come. Well, there's a responsibility that goes with that scripture. &gt;&gt; Then the spirit and the bride have to be saying come. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to come? The message of COME IS COME OUT of &gt;&gt; and COME INTO &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF DEATH. COME OUT OF DARKNESS. COME OUT OF DENOMINATIONS. Come out of RELIGIOUS TRADITION. COME OUT OF YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING. COME OUT and come into come where? Come to the river of life. &gt;&gt; Come to Christ. Come to the truth. Come to the fullness of the word. And that's our responsibility. Just say come. Come to light. Come to truth. Now I'm not of the opinion that you, you know, ram it down everybody's throat who stands still for 30 seconds. But we live a life. We demonstrate a life. We rub shoulders. You live a normal life and in course of life questions come up, doors open, opportunities come and I can be the nicest person in the world to somebody but my niceness is not going to give them redemption. It's going to take this word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Them being nice to me might cause them to be able to enter into eternal life at the white throne judgment. I don't know. That might be a transfer that God allows. But for them to come to redemption and be part of this redemption plan and come back to where they've fallen from and come back to be bride if they're elect of God is going to take more than my niceness and my kindness. Amen. To bring them in. It's actually going to take prophesying again. &gt;&gt; It's going to take testifying of this message and what this message is because it's this message that brings redemption. It's this message that brings life. It's this message of Jesus Christ that is the river of life. &gt;&gt; It is life. It is Christ. It is true. It is the word. And then I want to leave you with this from 2 Corinthians 5:18. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. To it that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us. How is God calling beseeching calling to them talking to them? How was God talking to them? By Paul &gt;&gt; now how is God talking to them &gt;&gt; how is God talking to your coworker? How is God talking to your family member? How's God talking to your neighbor? How is God going to beseech anybody that's near you? &gt;&gt; By us. That's easier to say &gt;&gt; by us. We pray you in Christstead. We're in the place of Christ. I'm talking to you. I'm in Christstead. I pray you in Christstead. Be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Amen. Let's stand together. Let's be ambassadors for Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us beseech when we have the opportunity to beseech, to call out to somebody to come. Amen. God may give you many opportunities in many different ways, large and small, whatever open door, answering a question. There's all kinds of ways to talk to somebody. Amen. But we have to realize that what we carry is the word of reconciliation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What we carry is the fullness of redemption and we are witnesses to it. &gt;&gt; What we carry is a truth that can have somebody's sins remitted. &gt;&gt; Have somebody loosed from their sins. It's powerful, friends. This message is powerful. And I say, I want to be more conscious of that every day of my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I'm afraid I'm not conscious enough of it. But can you imagine sharing with somebody the true story of redemption who's never heard it? &gt;&gt; I mean, if you ask somebody if you're a Christian and say yes, that does not mean they know the story of redemption. &gt;&gt; That does not. You can talk to people all day long who's Christians and apparently this is a Christian cuh country and a Christian culture and we live in a conservative area and everybody, you know, everybody goes to church even if it's once a year and everybody's saved and everybody prays and everybody knows Christ. But the problem is they know nothing about the plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; And when you tell somebody that God didn't come to save you just so you can go to heaven and they look at you like, "What?" Hey, listen. That's a good that's a good conversation starter. But you realize we don't just listen. This message is not just repeating the same gospel story they've heard over and over and over. This is completely different. &gt;&gt; This is completely different. This is the why behind everything we've ever been taught. &gt;&gt; Why virgin birth? Why Calvary? Why shedding of blood? Why redemption? Why is it called redemption? Why is it called reconciliation? Why is there a restoration? What is it all about? Why Eden? Why Why eating apples and then wearing aprons? &gt;&gt; Why eating fruit and getting a garment? &gt;&gt; Amen. We have the truth that unlocks and unveils Christ to this generation. &gt;&gt; We have it. When the disciples left after after the upper room experience, Amen. After they saw Jesus ascend on high, they got the Holy Ghost. God unlocked the mysteries. Amen. Paul uh Peter comes out and saying this is that and this is that and this is that and now he can take what he's experienced and place it in the Bible and say this is prophecy fulfilled. And they go out and they start sharing amen what they've happened. They can't go back and retach the law and they can't go back and tell them to take a lamb and go to the a priest and and then you'll be absolved. They can't go backwards. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it shifted. &gt;&gt; And we can't go backwards. &gt;&gt; All we can say is come to Christ. &gt;&gt; He's available. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's standing here unveiled wanting to unite with somebody. We can't go back to denominational teaching, denominational doctrine. We've got to come to the new dispensation. Amen. Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's brought an open book. &gt;&gt; And the open book is him. &gt;&gt; And what's in the open book? My name &gt;&gt; But the open book is a revelation of him. &gt;&gt; But in the open book is my name. &gt;&gt; But the book is him. &gt;&gt; But he is those seals that was revealed. But under the seals is a revelation of the mystery of God. But under theirs my name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're part of it and we're looking for anybody else who's part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. God bless you. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving. May the Lord give you rest. May he give you good times with your family. May you have a wonderful time. May you be refreshed in it. And may God help us. Amen. To be a witness &gt;&gt; of this glorious message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, Father, that you have given us something far beyond stories, far beyond just history, Lord. It's the revelation that makes the history come alive. It's the revelation that makes the stories real. God, it's not a Sunday school teaching and it's not Lord just a denominational understanding, but you freed us from all of that and lifted us higher. You began to show us your great mystery that you held in yourself all this time. What you really wanted and what you were doing and why you were doing it and how you purchased it back and how you've redeemed it through seven ages and now what you're doing in the end time and where you're working and why and how. And God, we don't we know that in ourselves we're not worthy to take this book. We're not worthy, Lord, to to look at it, to read it, to know it. Lord, we're not worthy. But God, we believe you've made us worthy. You've called for us, Lord, to go take the book, God, I pray you'd help us come and Lord, come to you and receive this revelation from you where you open yourself and you reveal to us all that's been in your mind all of this time. What is the one goal you've had and the one purpose you've been trying to achieve all through the Bible? The thing that's been your heart's desire, your great masterpiece work. What have you been working on all this time? You've revealed it to us here at the end. And God, it's such a beautiful picture. It's such a wonderful revelation. God, help us to prophesy again. God, help us to take this to anybody with an ear to hear, a heart to understand. God, use our mouths, Lord. Use our lives as a witness. And Lord, use our testimony, Lord, to open doors and use our mouths to share this truth. For God, this is the greatest light that we've ever seen. This is such a wonderful truth in this hour. And God, I pray that we, Lord, who you have made worthy, may we come and receive this truth. And may we be willing, Lord, to bear the consequences of taking the book of the bitter belly, the rejection, the misunderstanding. May we be willing to do that so that somebody might find life. For Lord Jesus, you didn't take the book to keep it to yourself, but you shared it with us. And God, help us not to take the book to keep it to ourselves, but help us to follow your example and be willing to share the contents of that book with someone else. God, give us a talk to, Lord. Give us a witness on the inside. Use us, direct us, guide us. God, we don't want to mishandle your truths, and we don't want to be rough with people. We don't want to be rude, and we don't want to be arrogant. We don't want to do anything wrong with this precious word that's so valuable, so sweet, so precious. But God, if your Holy Spirit will guide us, Lord, I believe what we have is what this world needs. I believe what you've given us, Lord, is the finishing of redemption, the culmination of your plan, the finishing of your works in the gentile age. And God is so precious and it's so lovely and so sweet and so wonderful. I just want to share it with somebody else. Lord, I just want to I want this power that remits and this power that looses to go out to somebody else. And God, would you guide my feet and guide my eyes and guide my understanding and guide my mouth and just take me as a vessel in your hand and use me? Use me in every conversation and with everyone I talk to in any way that you can. Help me be sensitive to your leading, Lord, and not a bull, but Lord, just a a a a vessel in your hand, an instrument that you can use. For God, I want to witness of this that I've seen and that I've heard and that I know to be true. And God, I thank you that I have a voice and I'm on this earth at this time and you've given me the opportunity to stand for this truth, to proclaim it. Lord, it's the greatest privilege of my life is to be able to proclaim this truth with the vocal cords that you've given me. For it is the power of salvation in this hour. But we love you. We ask for your help, your guidance, your leadership. As we go out, Lord, with family and have fellowship and with friends, I pray that you'd use us as a light in this world. and may others use that light and find their passage to safe harbor, find themselves at your feet. Lord, we love you. We ask that you would bless us and help us and guide us in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you all, brother John. For I will take you from the nations and will bring you to your own land. And I'll be sanctified in you before the eyes of man. And a new heart will I give you. And place my spirit within. I'll sprinkle clean water on you and save you from your sin. There is a fountain open in the house of David. you believe. And there are streams of grace that's flowing now from Calary gone now and receive. And I will pour upon the house of my chosen one the spirit of grace and oflication. And in that day, what a day that will be that a fountain will be opened up and you shall be holy clean. There is a fountain open in the house of David. to you believe. And there are streams of grace that's flowing down from Calary home now and receive. Amen. I just want to say I'm sorry. I fully intended to be less than an hour tonight. I know everybody's busy and got plans tomorrow, but my I love this word and I love you all and I love to proclaim it. And I just want to ask you a question. Amen. Christ took the book for us, but who are we taking the book for? Because when John took the book, he was told to prophesy again. Why don't we take it for our children? Why don't we take it for our spouses? Why don't we take it for our loved ones? Why don't we take it for our co-workers? Why don't we take it for somebody else in this world? Christ took it for us. He was worthy. We weren't worthy, but he took it not to keep for himself, but to share it with us so that we would have rapturing faith. So that we could have a change in the body. So that we would know him like we could never know him before. Then he told John to take the book and take it but prophesy to others kingdom kings and nations and tongues and peoples. So I don't want to just take the book for myself but I want to take it for somebody else. I want to take the book for my children. And I want to live the contents of the book before them. You want to share it with them so that they get hungry and they want to go to him and take the book too. I want to take the book for my wife. I want to take it for you all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are you going to take it for? Cuz you get an opportunity to prophesy again. Amen. And if you have it and you've taken it, it's part of you, then you've got something to give to somebody else with power and life and salvation and redemption. Amen. This message is so glorious, so beautiful, so powerful, so wonderful. Amen. We don't throw it like pearls before swine and cast it. But no, but every time we have a chance, it's a pearl that's dear to my heart. When somebody's willing to take it, I want to take it out. And I want to share it with them, too. I don't want to take the book just for me, but take it for you. All who will and whosoever will, let him come to the water of life and drink. Man, I think we have to stop thinking of the gospel so egocentrically. It's all about me. He saved me. He wants me. Redeemed me. I'm saved. I get a body change. I that's all true. But every time salvation and redemption comes, it turns the redeemed into a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. John wasn't worthy to take the book, but Christ made him worthy. And when he became worthy, then he went and took the book. When he took the book, then he prophesied again. Christ has made us worthy to take this message, to feast on it, to eat it, to digest it, to be one with it. And because he made me worthy, now I want to go and give it to somebody else. Amen. Let's be conscious of taking the book, not for ourselves, but let's take it so that we have something of life, of eternal value to give to somebody else. Amen. God bless you all. Have a wonderful holiday. Amen. And I'm sorry, but I but I love you. Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother John. As I look back in history, I see a mighty God unveiled. He's proving over and over that his word will never fail. Oh, but I'm not not just dwelling on a past memory. Oh, it's the same God and he's living in me. And he's the same God. He spoke to the woman at the well. And he's the same God whose wonders are too many to tell. And the same God who parted the raging Red Sea. Yes, he's the same God and he's living in me. for the same God who created all the heavens, all the earth. Then he came back living in Jesus. There was power in his word. And now in these last days, I'm beginning to see that it's the same God and he's living in me. Yes, he's the same God who spoke to the woman at the well. Oh, he's the same God whose wonders are too many to tell. Oh, he's the same God who parted the raging red sea and is the same God and he's living in me. Oh, he's the same God. And he's the same God who spoke to the woman and the whale. And he's the same God whose wonders are too many to tell. He's the same God for the raging red sea and he's the same God and he's living in me. Go left. He's alive and well. He's living in me to tell the world. Oh, that he is the same. Oh, he's the same. Yesterday and today and forever. Jesus is alive and well. Oh, he's alive and well. All living in me to tell the world that he is the same. Glor is the same. And today and forever Jesus is alive and well. Oh, he's alive and well. And I am redeemed. And I'm bought with a price for Jesus has changed my whole life. And if anybody asks you just who I am, you can tell them, "Oh, that I am redeemed." And where there was hate, oh love now abides. way. There was confusion. Oh, peace now reigns. And I'm walking with Jesus. I'm a child of the King. And it's all because I am redeemed. Oh, I am redeemed. I'm bought with the Christ. And Jesus has changed my whole life. And if anybody asks you just who I am, you can tell them that I am redeemed. So I'll tell his favor and I'll tell of his love and I'll tell of his goodness to me. For he purchased my redemption with his preious blood and from sin he set me free. Oh I am redeemed. God with a price and Jesus has changed my whole life. And if anybody asks you just who I am, you can tell them that I am redeemed. Amen.
