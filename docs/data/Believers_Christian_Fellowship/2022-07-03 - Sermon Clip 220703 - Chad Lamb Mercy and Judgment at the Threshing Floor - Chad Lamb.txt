TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he was he was saying amen uh you know unless you drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no life with me you know he didn't have to be mean the statement itself was going to bring a separation he was preaching the truth amen of spiritual communion of partaking of christ he said lest you drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no life with me and many of his disciples said this is a hard saying who can hear it amen and many walked away and then they they go to ask him you know it's a hard saying and he says well if you don't like that what about if you shall see the son of man return into heaven where he came from and the rest walked away what was he separating by not by his attitude not by his hardness or his harshness he was separating by the revelation of the word he was dropping the revelation of the word and they couldn't handle the word for their day they couldn't handle the fresh revelation of the word amen it was confusing to them it didn't sound right it actually sounded wrong to drink blood and eat flesh and you as a human being come down from heaven it didn't sound right it was it didn't make sense to their understanding it didn't sound like what they had been been hearing in their traditional understanding amen and he brought the word amen in such a way it brought a separation amen and the message has come to bring us back to the true revelation of the word for our day and the message brings separation not with an arrogant attitude not with a hateful speech or a hard delivery it brings you can whisper the true revelation and it'll bring a separation amen because what was god doing he was separating the wheat from the husk he had 70 that had went two by two preaching the gospel and now they walked away and he turns to peter and to the disciples he said well you go also he is this is not the gathering time for jesus's ministry this is the time that he's blowing chaff away separating out the multitude separating out the 70 turning to the closest friends as closest companions as helping the ministry to the disciples and he said will you go also and peter says to whom shall we go thou alone have the words they had no place else to go they didn't have an explanation for what he said they didn't have an understanding or comprehension of what they said what they had was a c gene on the inside that could say there's no place else to go this is truth amen this is right i may not understand it i can't explain it i don't know why everybody's leaving but this is the truth amen and what was he doing he was using the revelation of the word to separate the chaff from the wheat
