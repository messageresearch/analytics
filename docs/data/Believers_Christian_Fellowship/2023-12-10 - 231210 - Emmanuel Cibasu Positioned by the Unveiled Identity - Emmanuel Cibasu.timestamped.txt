[17:08] you you may be seated for a little while
[17:13] I am breing greetings uh from our pastor
[17:17] so he did uh call me and uh we did talk
[17:21] they are having great
[17:25] meetings and uh this week they will be
[17:28] also so very
[17:30] busy with the meetings just keep them in
[17:32] your
[17:33] prayers I've been there in those in the
[17:36] on the mission field and the mission
[17:39] field unless you're there you probably
[17:41] will not have a full understanding of
[17:45] it the enemy could use even the water
[17:48] you're
[17:49] drinking to cut you off even the food
[17:53] you're
[17:54] eating even the place you're sleeping
[17:56] because it's not your home you can be
[17:59] Sleepless so there just so many many
[18:03] many things that the enemy would like to
[18:05] put his hand on to disturb to discourage
[18:08] not only that they might be there and
[18:10] they feel something coming from back
[18:11] home something happened that's how the
[18:14] enemy does not only we pray for them we
[18:16] pray for their families that are left
[18:18] behind and uh prayers unless you are
[18:22] away unless you are in need you can know
[18:25] really what it means to you so let's
[18:27] keep them in pray prayers and uh I know
[18:31] that uh this morning I have only a few
[18:35] scriptures and a few
[18:38] quotations and it's you who's going to
[18:40] be pulling that out and I trust that the
[18:43] Lord will speak to us this morning let's
[18:45] stand and just read the a
[18:49] scripture but before we can read that
[18:52] scripture there's a a little
[18:56] quotation from the prophet in 1955 in
[18:59] the the message the way to have
[19:02] Fellowship you might be the scripture
[19:04] would be in uh The Book of
[19:08] John chapter 18 while you are looking
[19:12] into that chapter 18 let's find that
[19:16] before I can read
[19:19] the the the quotation and also find the
[19:26] verse if you are there just put your
[19:29] hand there and just listen to this
[19:33] quotation the prophet of God
[19:35] said just
[19:38] think when he says that something within
[19:42] me what are you going to be thinking
[19:44] about it's not your friend who telling
[19:47] you hey let's think this is an
[19:53] ordained prophet of the age and we will
[19:57] see the later on as we'll be reading the
[20:00] scripture if you still have him as a
[20:04] prophet you have the Sixth
[20:09] Seal if you still have him as your
[20:12] Prophet as a
[20:14] prophet you're not there
[20:16] yet we've been visited by more than a
[20:21] prophet he said just
[20:24] think job the oldest book of the Bible
[20:28] he longed for
[20:30] Fellowship how many long for Fellowship
[20:33] this
[20:34] morning I long for
[20:36] that he knew there was a
[20:40] Creator and he believed him with all of
[20:44] his heart amen and he said in a child
[20:48] child way of saying it oh if I could
[20:53] only get to
[20:55] him if I only knew where he
[21:01] lived at I could go up and knock on his
[21:06] door and talked to him just a little
[21:12] while now job the prophet of God said
[21:15] that he was uh he was a
[21:17] lawyer he was a man very
[21:20] intelligent he was advising counseling
[21:24] thousands of his
[21:26] generation he was high Man full of
[21:29] knowledge or so blessed the go the word
[21:32] of God said he was perfect in his day
[21:35] but look what a perfect man naturally
[21:39] you could not equal him spiritually God
[21:43] chose him elected him but that man
[21:45] longed for
[21:49] something said I could go up and knock
[21:52] on his door and talk to him just a
[21:56] little while wouldn't we we all love to
[21:59] do
[22:00] that we would and the prophet of God say
[22:04] says but
[22:07] think he is God he is closer to you than
[22:13] his
[22:18] door his
[22:20] door he is closer to you than his door
[22:24] we're looking for his door the prophet
[22:27] job is looking for his door but the
[22:29] prophet of God in this day said he's
[22:32] closer to you than his
[22:35] door and he said his door is your
[22:43] heart you want to go knock on his
[22:47] door knock at your heart amen
[22:51] amen and if you want to find
[22:55] him you have to already have invited him
[22:58] in your heart amen so whenever you want
[23:00] to knock at his door you can knock at
[23:02] your heart's door and say are you still
[23:05] there if he's not in your heart where
[23:09] are you going to be finding him right so
[23:12] you've got to have invited him first in
[23:15] your
[23:16] heart he said and he's so close
[23:21] tonight he's closer to you than your
[23:24] right arm
[23:26] is he's a part of
[23:29] you and if we can only realize that he's
[23:34] here amen if we can only realize that he
[23:38] is here he is not risen sitting up on
[23:42] the
[23:43] tomb or risen and went up to heaven and
[23:46] having a party
[23:48] there he's risen and he's still here and
[23:52] this morning he's here amen said and how
[23:57] he wants to fellowship with
[23:59] us his heart is greater for Fellowship
[24:03] than ours are when you desire within you
[24:07] to fellowship with God that's not even
[24:10] 1% of what he wants to do with
[24:15] you and the reason he makes us that way
[24:19] because we are offsprings of
[24:23] his
[24:25] amen we are off Springs of
[24:30] his what would happen if this morning
[24:33] sorry to keep you standing but we're
[24:34] going to be reading the the scripture
[24:36] you'll be you'll be sitting down I'll be
[24:38] S
[24:39] standing what would happen this morning
[24:42] if Bill
[24:44] Gate would come and
[24:47] just
[24:48] brother don't you know that you are my
[24:51] Offspring this
[24:54] morning what would happen in your mind
[24:56] what would go on in your mind
[24:58] right right I'm me offspring of multi
[25:06] billionaire probably some of the
[25:07] pressures of a house car payment house
[25:11] mortgage payments that pressure just
[25:14] before even you can even get a check
[25:15] before he can even tell you that hey I'm
[25:17] going to make you a check they fade
[25:23] away he said that's what makes us long
[25:28] for
[25:30] Fellowship that's what makes a
[25:34] mother would die for her
[25:38] baby let's go to the scripture reading
[25:42] John chapter
[25:48] 18 verse
[25:51] 28 to get uh just the thought there
[26:00] John 18 verse 28 he he goes then LED
[26:05] they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the Hall
[26:09] of judgment and it was
[26:13] early and they themselves went not into
[26:17] the Judgment Hall lest they should be
[26:21] defiled but they might eat the Passover
[26:25] you might you might sit down so we can I
[26:26] will keep read in the the
[26:32] remaining Jews could not even walk into
[26:34] C's
[26:36] home they deemed themselves so
[26:40] holy there couldn't be this who they
[26:43] have the one they have arrested they
[26:45] arrested him not last night last evening
[26:49] that evening he didn't
[26:51] sleep that evening he was standing from
[26:55] going from HS to Halls
[26:59] from the Hall of
[27:02] anus C's
[27:05] father-in-law from there to cus Hall
[27:10] from there to Pilot's Hall the entire
[27:13] evening and it was very cold because
[27:16] remember Peter wanted to be warmed
[27:22] outside and the Jews when the day was
[27:25] over when from the evening it passed
[27:27] into the next day they said into that
[27:30] Hall we cannot even walk in we are so
[27:32] holy we we are part partaking of the
[27:35] Passover we cannot stand with that
[27:38] despised man
[27:40] there not knowing that we're standing in
[27:43] the presence of the very
[27:46] Passover the very one that was the
[27:49] pillar of fire taking them to through
[27:52] the
[27:53] Wilderness By Night the pillar of cloud
[27:56] by day amen amen he was standing
[28:03] there I said we want we don't want to go
[28:06] in because we want to take our Passover
[28:09] easily we
[28:11] holy he couldn't speak a
[28:16] word pilate then
[28:23] 29 pilate then went unto them
[28:28] and said what accusation bring ye
[28:30] against this
[28:32] man they answered and said unto him if
[28:36] he were not a malactor
[28:40] the Passover the true Passover the Lamb
[28:43] of God was a malactor to the
[28:51] Jews we would not have delivered him up
[28:54] unto thee then said Pilate unto them
[28:58] take ye
[29:00] him and judge him according to your
[29:05] law right
[29:07] then the the the the the the scripture
[29:11] the prophecy is unfolding itself do you
[29:16] remember when Jesus was on Earth he told
[29:18] them that I will be delivered my brother
[29:20] will be delivering me the Jews will be
[29:24] delivering me the Jews will not kill me
[29:28] they will be delivering me they will be
[29:30] rejecting me but the one who's be
[29:32] carrying out the killing the Gentiles
[29:34] will do and then we're going to see
[29:37] those those identities being just opened
[29:41] up in the
[29:42] scripture cuz they were hiding you can
[29:44] do something in hiding but when God's if
[29:47] it's in the prophecy it's going to be
[29:51] opening up we will know who is doing
[29:53] what
[29:56] am
[29:59] then
[30:01] 31 then said pilate unto them take ye
[30:05] him and judge him according to your law
[30:08] the Jews therefore said unto him it is
[30:11] not lawful for us okay they are now
[30:15] identifying themselves as who the
[30:22] Jews to put away a man to death they did
[30:27] recognize not how we have a law now but
[30:30] with within our law We cannot put a man
[30:32] to death and that was
[30:35] true in the Ten Commandments you could
[30:38] not kill a
[30:39] person it was
[30:43] forbidden
[30:45] 32 that the saying of Jesus might be
[30:48] fulfilled uhoh there was a saying there
[30:52] there was a prophecies there that must
[30:55] be
[30:56] fulfilled
[30:58] which he spake signifying what death he
[31:01] should
[31:02] die that death was to be carried he was
[31:06] to be rejected by the Jews handed over
[31:09] to the
[31:10] Gentiles to achieve him to do the
[31:13] crucifying because they were
[31:16] specializing into
[31:18] that
[31:21] professionals
[31:23] 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment
[31:26] Hall
[31:28] again torn he was torn this
[31:34] man but you know what you could be torn
[31:37] you can struggle you can do your own
[31:39] your effort will bring
[31:42] nothing it's his
[31:45] ordination it's his
[31:49] election and called Jesus and said unto
[31:53] him are thou a king of the
[31:55] Jews Jesus Jesus answered him saith thou
[32:01] sayth thou this thing of thyself or did
[32:04] other tell it thee of
[32:08] me
[32:11] uh-oh is this message is someone telling
[32:14] it to
[32:16] you or is it something that you know
[32:19] it's coming from you know of that you
[32:22] know that you know that you know that
[32:24] this is
[32:26] it
[32:28] pilate
[32:29] answered
[32:31] answered now he's going to be exposing
[32:34] his identity too am I a Jew okay so we
[32:39] know that he was not a Jew
[32:42] then thine own nation and the chief
[32:44] priests have delivered thee unto me what
[32:48] hast thou
[32:50] done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of
[32:54] this world if my kingdom were of this
[32:57] world then would my servants fight that
[33:01] I should not be delivered to the Jews
[33:04] but now is my kingdom not from
[33:08] hence pilate therefore said unto him are
[33:12] thou a king then Jesus answered thou
[33:15] sayest that I am a king to this
[33:22] end to this end was I born and for this
[33:26] cause came I into the world that I
[33:29] should bear witness unto the truth
[33:31] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[33:35] word my my
[33:38] voice as you are standing there we just
[33:41] bow our heads again precious
[33:44] Lord we have read these precious
[33:49] words that have been father washed over
[33:52] for
[33:53] Generations many of our precious
[33:56] brothers and sisters
[33:58] s gave with their blood that could not
[34:01] even come closer to yours just for these
[34:04] writings could be kept as we're reading
[34:08] them Father We Are The Most Blessed
[34:10] people we read them with
[34:12] reverence whether we do we don't
[34:15] understand them but just knowing what it
[34:18] costs for us to have them and father we
[34:21] ask that you will come and just open
[34:23] your word and teach us father and bless
[34:26] you children and all of us together in
[34:29] Jesus Christ name we pray
[34:31] amen God bless you this morning I was uh
[34:35] as we're driving
[34:37] in I uh just happened to ask my
[34:41] daughter a
[34:43] question I
[34:45] said why would it be W what
[34:49] benefit would it be to
[34:52] you if the Son of
[34:54] God whom you know that he Christ God in
[34:58] the human flesh would come down from
[35:02] heaven and would just be going visiting
[35:07] Parks visiting the hospital full of love
[35:11] going from bed hospital bed to another
[35:14] hospital
[35:16] bed full of
[35:18] compassion saying I will come in I will
[35:20] visit you you need something I can bring
[35:23] to you you will bring you a cup of water
[35:25] bring you some medication
[35:27] he would leave there he would go maybe
[35:29] to the library read some newspapers
[35:32] sometimes when he gets a little asleep
[35:35] or sleeps there send people in the
[35:37] library they might sleep a little bit
[35:39] there and he would rest and would wake
[35:41] up would go help one one person there
[35:45] and then when there are there are mass
[35:47] mass murders somewhere mass shooting
[35:50] somewhere he would come there who try to
[35:52] get all the wounded or maybe those that
[35:54] need to be taken care in the hospital he
[35:56] would go there and just try to do his
[36:00] best said knowing that he's doing that
[36:04] what would what benefit would you get
[36:06] from
[36:08] that you know who he is you have his
[36:11] full
[36:13] identity what benefit would you get from
[36:17] that there's no
[36:19] benefit because if my kids are are shoot
[36:23] and and killed he would just come after
[36:26] they are shoot to be
[36:29] compassionate but he would not help
[36:31] prevent
[36:36] it so he is a Son of God the Son of God
[36:42] just having his um compassionate work on
[36:46] Earth no the benefit would be if he
[36:49] takes my
[36:51] place he takes the place of my
[36:55] children of my grand children of my
[36:58] brother and my sister that's what he's
[37:01] supposed to do so having an
[37:05] identity without a position that's right
[37:09] there's no benefit to
[37:13] that he would be
[37:15] identified fully identified as the
[37:18] Messiah as the Son of God but as long
[37:21] he's not in his
[37:23] position I have no benefit
[37:27] Christians are the same way that's how I
[37:30] brought this little subject uh this
[37:33] little title of
[37:35] positioned by the unveiled
[37:40] identity once your identity is
[37:44] unveiled Amen to be able to be in God's
[37:49] steps of fulfillment of the scripture
[37:52] you must be
[37:55] positioned it is is
[37:58] positioned by the unveiled
[38:05] identity the prophet of God says
[38:08] this about the scenario that was
[38:12] happening here here's a Jesus standing
[38:15] before the
[38:16] Jews there about to crucify
[38:21] him he said in the questions and
[38:24] answered 1963
[38:27] but remember God is infinite so where he
[38:31] was standing there he was
[38:36] infinite infinite what it is let listen
[38:39] to The
[38:40] Prophet do you believe that infinite and
[38:43] then he is
[38:46] omniscient do you believe that
[38:48] omniscient means he knows all things he
[38:53] can't be omniscient without being
[38:55] infinite excuse me if I take this
[39:05] this he
[39:09] said he can't be omnicient without being
[39:13] infinite see there never was nothing but
[39:17] what he
[39:19] knew all the scenarios that were going
[39:22] around
[39:23] him the Jews trying to convince as many
[39:26] people as they
[39:29] could he saw he knew all those
[39:33] things he knew every n that would ever
[39:36] be on
[39:39] earth um I had to look it up the N A
[39:43] Nat I'm from another country I was said
[39:46] what is a
[39:47] n it's said you know it better than than
[39:50] me right it's a small tiny insect yeah
[39:53] oh yeah how many of them would be on
[39:57] earth just maybe on if if they live only
[40:00] for maybe let's put they live for a few
[40:02] days or a couple of hours just maybe in
[40:05] in in an hour how many of them would
[40:07] would be on
[40:08] earth he said he knew every na that
[40:12] would ever be on Earth that would ever
[40:15] so since the world has been he knows
[40:18] every one of
[40:23] themall and how many times it would bat
[40:27] its
[40:28] eyes uhuh he's going deeper into
[40:32] that and how much Tallow it would make I
[40:37] had to look those things
[40:39] up how much all of them make
[40:44] together he knew every breath that you
[40:48] would
[40:49] breathe and how deep it would go in your
[40:55] lung
[40:56] you're talking about our Jehovah this is
[40:59] my father this is your
[41:02] father you're talking about a father you
[41:06] have it it's it's blowing your mind and
[41:10] he says that's
[41:13] infinite oh oh that's the definition of
[41:16] infinite we can go to the thesaurus
[41:19] dictionary and said we're going to
[41:21] change that
[41:22] definition infinite means this
[41:29] right now if he infinite
[41:34] if that makes him omniscient is that
[41:38] right and if he is omniscient that makes
[41:42] him omnipresent th those those are big
[41:47] words because he knows just exactly the
[41:50] minute hour time to the split instance
[41:56] of the listen to that I have to go
[41:59] slowly on this
[42:01] one he has because he knows just
[42:05] exactly the minute we're going slower
[42:10] the
[42:10] hour the time to the split
[42:15] instance of
[42:20] 55,000 of a
[42:25] second
[42:27] oh we getting
[42:30] that
[42:34] 55,000 of a second so before I can do
[42:38] this I'm
[42:43] late completely
[42:50] late to when it's going to
[42:55] happen see get the idea now we don't get
[43:00] it I personally don't get it I want to
[43:02] be a liar I don't get
[43:05] it but I believe it we believe
[43:09] it then he knows all things and that's
[43:13] the reason he has all power knows all
[43:17] things and can do all
[43:20] things he knew before the world began we
[43:25] would be sitting
[43:31] here if he knew before the world began
[43:34] that we would be sitting
[43:36] here my prayer is could you identify me
[43:41] on the right side of the
[43:45] prophecy cuz you could be sitting here
[43:49] in the same time the Jews were there
[43:51] pilate were there they were he knew they
[43:53] were sitting there in the prophecies is
[43:56] being there and he knew that he would be
[43:58] standing there among them he was
[44:00] fulfilling the right side of the
[44:01] prophecy and they were
[44:03] fulfilling the wrong side of the
[44:06] prophecy and the way we can fulfill the
[44:09] right side of the prophecy knowing that
[44:10] we're sitting here this morning know
[44:12] what let's believe him amen if there was
[44:16] something that we walked in this morning
[44:18] little doubt just let's look into that
[44:21] door let let's go to that door find him
[44:23] in your heart in my heart this morning
[44:25] said God kick that unbelief
[44:34] out he said he knew how many times I
[44:40] would raise my hands up and down am now
[44:44] he he knew the words I would say he knew
[44:49] how many times you would bat your eyes
[44:52] what you think before the world ever
[44:55] started what are we afraid
[45:01] about God is our father oh listen to
[45:05] that so the only way to summarize all
[45:08] these these great words and this great
[45:10] thinking right it has to be a father and
[45:14] I know that growing growing up in this
[45:17] congregation me included we have no idea
[45:21] of what a father
[45:23] means toddlers knows no better
[45:28] right cuz when you said my father you
[45:30] think oh I can think like him I can
[45:32] build like him I can do like him we
[45:36] grown-ups but for
[45:38] toddlers their fathers is the
[45:43] hero their fathers their father is the
[45:47] solution
[45:50] Giver every T knows that his dad can fix
[45:53] an
[45:54] airplane
[45:57] why they have greater Faith than we we
[46:01] have grown up we growns up we have
[46:05] lost am we have lost the meaning the
[46:09] content the depth of what a father
[46:12] means and glad that God has sent us this
[46:16] messag Amen to take us back there so we
[46:19] can know what a really a father
[46:22] means so having these Great ACT
[46:25] attributes of God being omniscient
[46:30] omnipresent
[46:32] infinite now let's go back into that
[46:35] Pilot's
[46:36] Hall and let's see
[46:38] him standing
[46:40] there
[46:42] identified to others as the Son of God
[46:47] to
[46:48] others as a manactor
[46:54] right he was standing there knowing all
[46:59] things he didn't sleep all
[47:02] night rejected by his
[47:05] own standing there knowing
[47:10] that in a couple hours from
[47:14] now my face will be filled with
[47:19] spit of drunken
[47:21] soldiers knowing that from now my face
[47:24] will be bleeding my entire body will be
[47:27] shivering
[47:30] shaking he knew all
[47:37] things knowing that his
[47:39] beard were to be proed off and jerked
[47:42] from his
[47:46] face he knew that a spear was about to
[47:50] to be R run into his
[47:54] heart the creation
[47:59] they were mocking him beating him making
[48:03] fun of
[48:06] him as a prophet of God said that a 10
[48:10] pound Roman
[48:13] spear had to be
[48:16] prepared to crush that heart he knew
[48:20] that few hours away from
[48:24] that he knew knew that what going to
[48:26] happen before the
[48:28] afternoon all these things are going to
[48:30] be taking
[48:35] place he knew that in a few hours from
[48:38] now the the the moon the Sun the Stars
[48:43] will will will not give their light they
[48:46] will run
[48:48] away to see their great Creator on the
[48:54] cross
[48:57] he knew the Rocks would be run off the
[49:03] mountain and the Earth was about to
[49:07] shake he knew that things were about to
[49:09] fall knowing that the veil is going to
[49:13] be turned today that Veil that they
[49:16] never gone be be behind it in the temple
[49:20] today it's that day just a couple of
[49:22] words from
[49:24] now standing
[49:27] there now he was standing there not
[49:30] because he did any
[49:36] wrong though he was the son of God God
[49:40] himself in a human flesh ident fully
[49:43] identified his identity fully unveiled
[49:47] to be this son of
[49:49] God Peter and others they saw him going
[49:52] to the to to the the tomb of Lazarus
[49:57] as he was walking a man who has dead
[50:00] been dead for 4
[50:02] days this dust man with dust on his
[50:05] clothes Jesus would walk up there
[50:07] Lazarus come come
[50:09] forth his his disciples have seen that
[50:12] they have witnessed that the power of
[50:15] that
[50:20] man they have seen him
[50:23] feeding more than five 5,000 people
[50:27] 5,000 men not counting the women and the
[50:30] children with just a few loaves of bread
[50:33] and and two
[50:34] fishes they've seen him doing
[50:38] that doing great things walking on the
[50:42] water and hear his standing there could
[50:46] not even speak a
[50:49] word knowing all
[50:54] things Peter and the disciples out we
[50:58] don't have time to go into the scripture
[51:00] that you know that Peter was out but
[51:02] before the scripture could be fulfilled
[51:05] one of the disciples who was in who was
[51:08] friend to the high priest has to go get
[51:09] Peter in because he has to be in a
[51:12] position to deny Jesus face to
[51:16] face cuz that scripture could not be
[51:19] fulfilling of of him denying him after
[51:22] the the has U um
[51:26] had done three
[51:28] times he had to be inside he had to be
[51:31] in a position that he can be looking at
[51:33] Jesus the once the C Crow crows he could
[51:37] see he could be facing Jesus so
[51:39] everything has to be the scripture had
[51:43] to be
[51:45] fulfilled the prophecy had to be
[51:47] fulfilled he's standing
[51:53] there why was he to be standing
[51:57] there because not only he was fully
[52:01] identified he had to be
[52:04] positioned he was in a position he was
[52:07] in the line of duty to save you and me
[52:12] amen as the Lamb of God he has to be
[52:15] standing there lower than
[52:19] Angels spit by every man who was around
[52:22] anyone who who want to spit on him they
[52:25] had the right to do
[52:35] that so we see
[52:37] three three parties
[52:40] here we see the Jews we see the Romans
[52:43] represented by pilate and the soldiers
[52:47] with the
[52:48] Christ Christ knew exactly who he
[52:52] was who his identity was
[52:55] and he knew exactly what he was
[52:58] fulfilling he knew his position he knew
[53:01] I'm standing here today there's no one
[53:02] else who could do
[53:04] it Adam's race was to be
[53:07] redeemed he was standing there
[53:09] fulfilling the scripture and there were
[53:11] two others the Jews and the
[53:13] Romans they did mention their attributes
[53:17] their identities but had having no clue
[53:21] what they were doing
[53:24] right
[53:29] I'm just skipping a lot of things here
[53:30] as the time is uh slipping
[53:34] away so just think that the blindness of
[53:36] the Jews and the pilot of of the Jews
[53:40] and
[53:43] pilot they were blind to their position
[53:46] their identities they would know their
[53:49] identities but they were blind to their
[53:50] position what they were doing
[53:53] there and as they had this man who was
[53:56] standing there the creator of Heaven and
[53:59] Earth for them he was someone who was
[54:03] disturbing their nature their
[54:12] religion he was causing their
[54:15] tribulations he was judging
[54:18] them wrongly because they had the law
[54:21] and this man was judging them so they
[54:23] had Christ standing there for them
[54:26] Christ represented the The Sixth
[54:32] Seal but the same Christ there
[54:35] representing the seventh seal for others
[54:38] for Peter and the
[54:40] others Peter was in a silent
[54:43] mode and the disciples they didn't know
[54:46] what was happening they
[54:49] confused heaven in
[54:52] Silence the disciples in silence
[54:57] looking at the men who could bring one
[55:00] to to life after 4 days who could feed
[55:02] thousands who could walk on the water
[55:04] and now he cannot even
[55:07] move Peter and and disciples could not
[55:09] understand that they could not explain
[55:13] that
[55:17] silence he was the seventh seventh seal
[55:21] for them but for this Jew and pilate
[55:24] this man was the worst this one is
[55:26] disturbing our religion he he's he's he
[55:30] he's disturbing our way of life Sixth
[55:33] Seal for
[55:38] them seventh seal in in in in in so much
[55:41] that as a prophet of God said let me
[55:43] just read this he said the seven seal
[55:47] seventh seal brings him back to the
[55:52] Earth amen the lamb came and took the
[55:56] book out of the right hand of him and
[55:58] sat down and claimed what he owned what
[56:01] he had redeemed so he was here this
[56:05] seventh seal brought him back on Earth
[56:07] he was the work in the work of
[56:09] redemption the work of redeeming every
[56:12] one of them those were on the book on
[56:15] the Book of
[56:17] Life the seventh seal for Mary Magdalene
[56:22] or The Sixth Seal for those Pharisees
[56:26] right seventh seal for Mary Magdalene in
[56:29] such a way that even when those two
[56:31] angels came to her what are you weeping
[56:34] for said they have taken my
[56:42] Lord if the same question was asked to
[56:46] the
[56:47] Jews take that malifa her
[56:53] away the prophet of God
[56:57] said in God's provided way now God has
[57:01] always had a
[57:04] way I love that always what whatever you
[57:09] you're going through whatever you might
[57:11] be experienced whether today or tomorrow
[57:15] or any
[57:16] time let's let's let let let me read
[57:19] this we can take it home God has always
[57:23] had a way
[57:29] don't be shut in in that condition in
[57:31] that situation in whatever it's going on
[57:33] in your life right now whether it's a
[57:35] sickness whether it's a confusion family
[57:37] fuse or something going on there's a way
[57:41] amen he is that way
[57:46] am he's got a way tonight like we can
[57:50] say he's got away this morning
[57:52] amen and God always before he sends a
[57:56] judgment he always makes a way of
[58:00] Escape out of every trial God makes a
[58:03] way of escape and God makes a way before
[58:07] he sends his judgment I might say first
[58:12] before he sends judgment he always sends
[58:17] mercy and if you spurn Mercy am there's
[58:23] nothing left but judgment and you have
[58:26] judged yourself those Jews had judged
[58:32] themselves they spurned mercy what was
[58:36] the seventh seal for others became the
[58:39] Sixth Seal to them what was mercy and
[58:43] deliverance and Redemption for others
[58:46] became their judgment and their
[58:48] condemnation in the same time am the
[58:51] very same subject the very same
[58:55] identity becoming condemnation for one
[59:00] becoming Deliverance for
[59:02] one right depending on which position
[59:06] are you in right amen which side are you
[59:10] in
[59:12] amen and the prophet keeps on saying
[59:15] notice the word that's ordained for each
[59:19] age when that word is made
[59:23] manifest that's Christ of that
[59:27] day just like it was in each one of the
[59:30] the the the
[59:32] days now when we find Jesus coming on
[59:35] the scene he was
[59:37] rejected yet he was the promised word
[59:41] now in Deuteronomy we don't have time
[59:43] because I see it's so sleeping
[59:46] so yeah it's going fast so we we'll just
[59:49] do a
[59:50] weekend I'm afraid of that time there
[59:54] yeah
[59:55] almost
[59:56] no it
[1:00:00] says when we find Jesus coming on the
[1:00:04] scene he was
[1:00:06] rejected yet he was the promised word
[1:00:09] now in dety 18 18:15 Moses said the Lord
[1:00:14] your God shall raise up a prophet like
[1:00:16] like me and it shall come to pass that
[1:00:19] whosoever shall not hear this Prophet
[1:00:22] will be cut off from among the people
[1:00:24] now there he was exactly the prophet for
[1:00:28] that age and the teachers of that day
[1:00:32] didn't see it they finally put him to
[1:00:37] death and if we might not have time to
[1:00:40] go in the book of Deuteronomy 18:15 you
[1:00:42] will find out that it says that the one
[1:00:46] that would not hearken that angel that
[1:00:49] he will not listen to him or pay
[1:00:51] attention to
[1:00:53] him God would would require of him
[1:00:57] meaning God will investigate again will
[1:01:01] seek with care what happened so they
[1:01:06] were in in kind of I might say in a kind
[1:01:09] of a better position even in the Book of
[1:01:12] Numbers we we might not have time to go
[1:01:14] that in the Book of Numbers you will
[1:01:15] find God saying and this is before the
[1:01:17] laws before Deuteronomy before God gave
[1:01:21] Moses the Commandments God is saying
[1:01:23] that that you know what if all the
[1:01:26] Commandments The Ten
[1:01:28] Commandments if they Heir ignorantly
[1:01:32] anyone HS ignorantly to do it to observe
[1:01:36] all the Ten Commandments there was still
[1:01:39] room for
[1:01:41] Mercy there was still room for
[1:01:44] Mercy but there was no room for Mercy
[1:01:48] for those that when the word is made
[1:01:51] flesh in your day you challenging that
[1:01:56] word right I wish we can have time to
[1:02:00] read those there was no way for them
[1:02:03] let's let's just go there there sorry
[1:02:05] sorry let Let's Take Time Deuteronomy 18
[1:02:09] if you would uh didn't put it in here
[1:02:12] but we can read
[1:02:16] it Deuteronomy
[1:02:23] 18
[1:02:32] it's not sunny outside so we don't have
[1:02:35] to rush out so there's nothing there
[1:02:37] anyway it's it's gloomy let's stay
[1:02:42] inside so Deuteronomy 18
[1:02:45] goes uh
[1:02:48] 15 the Lord thy God will raise up unto
[1:02:51] thee a prophet from the midst of Thee of
[1:02:54] thy Brethren like unto me unto him ye
[1:02:58] shall
[1:02:59] hearen now let's see who would not Haren
[1:03:02] that 16 according to all that thou
[1:03:06] desired of the Lord thy God in Horeb in
[1:03:10] the days of the assembly saying let me
[1:03:13] not hear again the voice of the Lord my
[1:03:16] God neither let me see the great fire
[1:03:21] anymore that I die not and the Lord said
[1:03:25] unto me they have well spoken that which
[1:03:29] they have spoken 18 I will raise them up
[1:03:33] a prophet from among their bre Brethren
[1:03:36] like unto thee and will put my words in
[1:03:40] his mouth amen and he shall speak unto
[1:03:44] them all that I shall command
[1:03:46] him now listen to 19 and it shall come
[1:03:50] to pass that who soever will not Hur
[1:03:54] Heen unto my
[1:03:56] words which he shall speak in my name I
[1:04:00] will require it of him meaning I will
[1:04:05] not kill him or cut him off I will
[1:04:09] investigate I still have
[1:04:12] mercy I still have mercy I will require
[1:04:15] I will examine and I will I will see
[1:04:18] what judgment I can give him but listen
[1:04:20] to the 20th 20th
[1:04:23] verse but but oh when it comes but
[1:04:26] something is changing there
[1:04:29] but the prophet which shall presume
[1:04:32] presume here means which
[1:04:36] shall which shall come
[1:04:39] presumptuously which will challenge
[1:04:42] which will will will come to question to
[1:04:46] to
[1:04:49] to yeah to question I will find the the
[1:04:52] word here
[1:04:55] which shall be def which would be
[1:04:58] defiant which be defiant or rebellious
[1:05:02] proudly to speak a word in my name which
[1:05:06] I have not commanded him to speak or
[1:05:09] that shall speak in the name of other
[1:05:13] gods even that Prophet shall die there
[1:05:17] there was no
[1:05:18] requiring death was striking you right
[1:05:21] away yeah let's go take um The Book of
[1:05:26] Numbers it's just
[1:05:29] uh a book before Deuteronomy if you go
[1:05:37] back uh numbers
[1:05:47] 15 and as we're going through this you
[1:05:50] might said why are we flipping these
[1:05:52] pages to find what
[1:05:55] in short sentences it's just
[1:05:58] that this
[1:06:01] message you can if if you cannot live
[1:06:06] the life of this message that it's not
[1:06:08] for
[1:06:10] you zip your
[1:06:13] mouth
[1:06:15] amen zip your mouth stay away from it
[1:06:20] don't say anything just said I cannot
[1:06:23] live it
[1:06:24] or I had my I've given you this
[1:06:28] testimony before I'm the last of in my
[1:06:31] family the oldest of my family is passed
[1:06:34] on a few years back he could not believe
[1:06:38] the message but he knew it was the truth
[1:06:41] when I presented it to him he would tell
[1:06:44] his own children if you want just a God
[1:06:47] where you can play have fun of this
[1:06:49] world follow me in my church but if you
[1:06:53] want the the god that can transform your
[1:06:55] life the god of Heaven follow my brother
[1:06:59] Emanuel he never believed it it was too
[1:07:03] harsh he respected it he said it's not
[1:07:05] for me yeah God would understand someone
[1:07:09] in that position amen but when you are
[1:07:12] rising up to start speaking
[1:07:16] against this
[1:07:18] message because this word that has been
[1:07:21] made flesh in this generation you have
[1:07:24] no other
[1:07:25] forgiveness amen if you have family
[1:07:28] members that do that we do have them
[1:07:31] just say just sip your
[1:07:36] mouth
[1:07:38] 15 let's start with 22 that's what we're
[1:07:42] going to be uh
[1:07:45] reading if you find it and if ye so this
[1:07:50] is God telling the children of Israel
[1:07:55] if ye have AED and not
[1:07:59] observed a l all these Commandments
[1:08:05] which the Lord has spoken unto
[1:08:07] Moses if you have
[1:08:10] AED so you have made mistakes ignorantly
[1:08:15] you have not walked according to these
[1:08:17] laws all of
[1:08:20] them even all 23 even all that the Lord
[1:08:24] has commanded you it's
[1:08:28] a all the Ten
[1:08:30] Commandments even all that the Lord has
[1:08:33] commanded you by the hand of Moses from
[1:08:36] the day that the Lord commanded Moses
[1:08:38] and hence and hence forward among your
[1:08:42] Generations then it shall be if ought to
[1:08:46] be committed by ignorance without the
[1:08:50] knowledge of the congregation that all
[1:08:52] the congregation shall offer one young
[1:08:54] bull bulock for a burnt offering for a
[1:08:57] sweet savior so I'm not going to finish
[1:09:00] that but we he's telling them hey you
[1:09:02] can offer this you can do this the the
[1:09:05] priest will do this will stand on your
[1:09:06] behalf that there was a way for you for
[1:09:09] me to forgive you to bring in but let's
[1:09:12] come down to to
[1:09:14] 28 and the priest shall make an an
[1:09:18] atonement for the soul that sinth
[1:09:21] ignorantly when the sinth
[1:09:24] when he sinth by ignorance before the
[1:09:27] Lord to make an atonement for him and it
[1:09:29] shall be forgiven him you see there's
[1:09:32] forgiveness there but if you go to 30
[1:09:36] verse 30
[1:09:38] now but we see the same word again
[1:09:41] coming
[1:09:42] up that the soul that doeth ought
[1:09:47] presumptuously this word presumptuously
[1:09:49] means rebelliously
[1:09:52] proud you saying that God has also
[1:09:56] spoken to
[1:10:00] me but the soul that that doeth ought
[1:10:04] presumptuously whether he be born in the
[1:10:07] land or a stranger the same reproaches
[1:10:10] the Lord and that Soul shall be cut off
[1:10:13] from among his people because he has
[1:10:17] despised the word of the
[1:10:20] Lord and has broken what not the these
[1:10:25] Commandments his commandment one
[1:10:28] commandment of the Lord once the word is
[1:10:31] made flesh in your
[1:10:33] day it becomes the only commandment
[1:10:37] that's right that once you go beyond
[1:10:39] that death has struck you
[1:10:43] amen so Christ was treated by one
[1:10:47] portion as the seventh
[1:10:50] seal by another group The multitude
[1:10:54] treating him as the SI seal their
[1:10:58] condemnation their judgment he's
[1:11:01] disturbing their
[1:11:04] nature and for the others he was the
[1:11:07] seventh
[1:11:11] seal
[1:11:13] now you can even have him as the seventh
[1:11:20] seal we bring it closer
[1:11:24] you can have him as the seventh
[1:11:28] seal but under which
[1:11:32] Angels because when the seventh seven
[1:11:36] seventh seal opened
[1:11:38] up Seven Angels were in the Seven
[1:11:41] Seals each one of them were was given a
[1:11:44] trumpet but there was only one who had
[1:11:47] eight trumpet and the
[1:11:50] voice so which angels are you which
[1:11:52] Angel are are you under within the
[1:11:55] seventh
[1:11:58] seal they sounded and the prophet of God
[1:12:00] said that all the seven trumpets even
[1:12:03] the seventh of the seventh angel were
[1:12:04] sounded under the Sixth
[1:12:07] Seal so which angels are you under
[1:12:10] within the seventh seventh
[1:12:13] seal are you under the Sixth six other
[1:12:20] Angels their trumpets were destroyed
[1:12:23] abbing the N
[1:12:26] nature so you within the seventh
[1:12:30] seal you've got to be under the seventh
[1:12:34] messenger who had both the trumpet and
[1:12:38] the
[1:12:39] voice and when you have that
[1:12:45] voice
[1:12:47] Revelation 108 said that voice was
[1:12:51] sounding from where from heaven
[1:12:54] so this
[1:12:55] message sorry that let's go into
[1:12:59] it when you listening or hearing it from
[1:13:03] your heart where is it coming
[1:13:06] from if you hearing it from on from the
[1:13:12] Earth from interpretation of
[1:13:16] man there's no there's no Mighty angel
[1:13:19] that you will go to meet amen it has to
[1:13:22] be you you have to be hearing this voice
[1:13:26] from Heaven
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:31] am because once you hear it from Heaven
[1:13:34] it will send you to the mighty angel
[1:13:36] that is on Earth that go take your
[1:13:39] book The open
[1:13:42] book so we might be feing this message
[1:13:47] but have we heard it from heaven or we
[1:13:50] still hearing it from the earth right
[1:13:56] we know that everyone claims they have
[1:13:58] Jesus right everyone claims he has Jesus
[1:14:01] we are coning that to them very fine you
[1:14:05] have it you have
[1:14:08] Jesus do you have him as the Sixth Seal
[1:14:11] or the seventh
[1:14:12] seal
[1:14:15] am if you do have him as the seventh
[1:14:18] seal do you have him as the voice under
[1:14:22] the seventh messenger seventh angel or
[1:14:25] under the six other Angels within the
[1:14:28] seventh
[1:14:33] seal do you have him as a your judge or
[1:14:37] your
[1:14:39] attorney tell us so you said you have
[1:14:43] Jesus do you have him as a Slicker or
[1:14:46] you have him as a husband right who
[1:14:50] takes care of you whom you can
[1:14:53] depend
[1:14:56] amen do you have him as a baby or a full
[1:15:00] matured Holy Spirit expressing his word
[1:15:03] through
[1:15:06] you tell me what Jesus do you have yeah
[1:15:16] right how are you treating
[1:15:20] him the Jesus that you have
[1:15:25] how would you treat him in his bride
[1:15:31] coming how do treat him in the formation
[1:15:34] of his
[1:15:38] bride the prophet of God said he did not
[1:15:41] just resurrect to go to sit on the tomb
[1:15:43] or to go up in heaven and start playing
[1:15:45] a
[1:15:46] harp he resurrected so he can stay on
[1:15:50] Earth so he can be in you and me
[1:15:53] so how are you treating him if he's
[1:15:55] within you if he is in that little
[1:16:00] door that is so closer to you than than
[1:16:03] even your arm yeah my arm is here but

[1:16:49] arm is closer to
[1:16:51] you that you can treat him
[1:16:55] as your
[1:17:03] husband the prophet of God says in the
[1:17:07] Look Away to

[1:17:15] this how many Pilots would be listening
[1:17:19] to this now pilot did not accuse
[1:17:23] him you might not have accused him but

[1:17:50] choice to show his position
[1:17:54] which side are you
[1:18:02] on I wonder how many Pilots will be
[1:18:05] listening to this that your position in
[1:18:08] some denomination will be too great when
[1:18:12] we talk about the denomination forget
[1:18:14] about the churches outside we have it
[1:18:16] sitting inside
[1:18:20] here we have a sitting inside of us here
[1:18:23] our mind is a denomination our thinking
[1:18:26] a denomination our thought our habits
[1:18:35] denomination we think our thoughts are
[1:18:37] so great our our habits are so great
[1:18:43] what we do is so great that's the
[1:18:45] greatness of denomination we
[1:18:48] have instead of accepting the Lord Jesus
[1:18:52] standing in the position that he is
[1:18:54] today which position is he standing
[1:18:57] today not there where he had to
[1:19:01] suffer to pay the price the ransom for
[1:19:04] our
[1:19:05] Redemption that was 2,000 years ago now
[1:19:09] he sitting in the position of a
[1:19:12] husband wanting to have a
[1:19:15] wife or you ready are you committed to
[1:19:19] him as a wife you know what I'm not let
[1:19:22] going you let go this is my
[1:19:27] day as we're driving up with my wife I
[1:19:30] said sometimes you think you said God is
[1:19:34] this thought keeps
[1:19:36] coming let everything I
[1:19:39] do or I say or I ever think something
[1:19:43] that I will never regret
[1:19:47] amen who can build a beautiful
[1:19:51] house and 40 years down the road he said
[1:19:55] I regret for spending such much so much
[1:19:58] money kids have grown up need to I need
[1:20:02] to sell it that's a little regret but
[1:20:05] when you did it it was right nothing
[1:20:07] wrong with
[1:20:08] that but my desire is God give me that
[1:20:12] every single decision every single thing
[1:20:14] I do will never
[1:20:18] regret um Marth that
[1:20:21] morning
[1:20:24] in the
[1:20:25] East when there is a morning someone is
[1:20:28] dead women don't even stand outside they
[1:20:31] don't even sit outside women are
[1:20:35] inside so Martha walking out to go find
[1:20:40] Jesus in the town where he has been for
[1:20:43] days it was an insult to that
[1:20:51] law a woman could not do that they sit
[1:20:56] inside on the the rugs they don't stand
[1:21:00] unless they have maybe go to the back
[1:21:02] maybe restrooms and come back inside for
[1:21:05] 40
[1:21:07] days so Martha did insult the laws of
[1:21:12] the
[1:21:14] Jews but she had never regret and she
[1:21:18] will never regret that so when she stood
[1:21:21] up the people murmuring what is she
[1:21:23] showing she's crazy she's not in her
[1:21:26] right
[1:21:29] mind perhaps she could not even explain
[1:21:31] to
[1:21:32] them but she would never regret yeah cuz
[1:21:37] in the very very hours that were
[1:21:39] following Lazarus came to to life so
[1:21:42] Martha could not regret that but even
[1:21:45] after Lazarus passed away do you think
[1:21:48] Martha could regret we're reading her
[1:21:51] today yeah
[1:21:54] amen a
[1:21:56] decision and you can only make it if
[1:21:59] Christ sitting in that
[1:22:02] room not when he's walking up and down
[1:22:05] or leaving no restrain him inside
[1:22:13] am and the Roman soldier that helped a
[1:22:16] nailed him there had punched the sword
[1:22:19] through his heart then he looked but it
[1:22:22] was too
[1:22:24] late sometimes we can wait and it's too
[1:22:29] late if God has promised to you the
[1:22:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost today could be
[1:22:36] that day tomorrow might be too
[1:22:41] late if you have promised you to walk
[1:22:44] with him in the newness of Light of Life
[1:22:48] in his light today could be that day
[1:22:51] tomorrow might be too late
[1:22:54] late the next day the Roman soldier was
[1:22:57] still walking
[1:22:59] around but it has been too late for
[1:23:03] him he missed his moment of visitation
[1:23:08] he had the time in the presence of that
[1:23:17] Jehovah he looked this is the roman
[1:23:20] soldier he looked and believed
[1:23:24] what he looked and believed but it was
[1:23:28] too
[1:23:32] late too late for him to
[1:23:36] believe what he had done had sealed his
[1:23:42] Doom he had run the spear through the
[1:23:45] savior's heart it was too
[1:23:48] late don't run the spear into his heart
[1:23:51] this morning
[1:23:53] you might say I'm not I'm not holding a
[1:23:55] spear the very spirit that is within you
[1:23:58] the very predisposition that is within
[1:24:02] you is it a
[1:24:06] spear or is it an open heart and say God
[1:24:10] if this is my
[1:24:12] day let did not pass me
[1:24:20] by I wonder how many Romans today has
[1:24:24] done the same
[1:24:26] thing when we're talking about the
[1:24:28] Romans about the Roman soldiers forget
[1:24:31] about those those 2,000 years ago check
[1:24:33] inside here we have Roman I have Roman
[1:24:35] soldiers inside of
[1:24:37] me I have the Romans inside of
[1:24:43] me and will do the same
[1:24:47] thing you might look someday but it
[1:24:49] might be too late I heard in the time
[1:24:52] time of Noah all those people believed
[1:24:55] but it was too
[1:25:00] late this is a time for
[1:25:03] Faith and the time where faith can no
[1:25:06] longer
[1:25:08] be
[1:25:18] attained let us come back home here
[1:25:21] Among Us ourselves
[1:25:23] again again when he was speaking about
[1:25:26] the history the stories the Bible we go
[1:25:28] those thousand years back let's just
[1:25:31] come back inside of us is I was saying
[1:25:33] if this angel of Malachi 4 let me repeat
[1:25:37] that if this angel of Malachi 4 is still
[1:25:42] a prophet to
[1:25:44] you then you haven't heard the voice
[1:25:47] which was spoken from
[1:25:51] heaven
[1:25:54] it is more than a
[1:26:01] prophet the prophet of God
[1:26:04] said in the message called Faith
[1:26:09] 1955 oh Eternal
[1:26:12] God you said in your scriptures that
[1:26:15] when the son of man shall reveal himself
[1:26:19] from heaven in the last day
[1:26:25] amen if we you still seeing a
[1:26:29] prophet you still hear the voice you're
[1:26:31] hearing just this that's the same voice
[1:26:34] of the message but through filters of
[1:26:37] men amen it needs a no
[1:26:42] filter so once brother Chad is standing
[1:26:45] here preaching that word the filter you
[1:26:48] have inside there it has to be from
[1:26:50] heaven so it catch Tes what is coming
[1:26:53] here from Heavenly places putting it in
[1:26:55] your heart but if it goes through
[1:26:58] another brother say and other men posted
[1:27:01] this on that that's here right the mind
[1:27:05] of man
[1:27:08] right he said I truly believe that you
[1:27:13] are now revealing yourself from
[1:27:18] Heaven to the church in Mercy and peace
[1:27:22] where is he revealing himself from from
[1:27:25] Heaven am the message if we listen to it
[1:27:29] we hear it that voice from Earth we
[1:27:34] doomed that's why we've seen many people
[1:27:38] presump presumingly for years 30 40
[1:27:42] years and then today they said there was
[1:27:44] never to nothing to it they heard it
[1:27:47] from here yeah amen and they couldn't
[1:27:50] help themselves yeah
[1:27:53] but if it comes from above from
[1:27:58] heaven and once you hear it from Heaven
[1:28:01] you will see things from Heaven amen cuz
[1:28:04] we we read John here let's turn to John
[1:28:07] 22 I'm revelation
[1:28:11] 22 I'm lost all over the
[1:28:17] place cuz once you hear it from
[1:28:20] heaven automattic ially you see things
[1:28:23] from
[1:28:24] Heaven revelation
[1:28:36] 22 22 verse
[1:28:48] 8 verse eight
[1:28:51] says and I John now remember John
[1:28:54] representing the Bride As the prophet of
[1:28:57] God says I John saw these things and
[1:29:02] heard them and when I had heard and
[1:29:06] seen meaning if you
[1:29:10] hear this message from
[1:29:13] Heaven automatically you will see things
[1:29:17] from Heaven you will see things that a
[1:29:21] neighbor a wife a husband a son a
[1:29:25] daughter dad mom cannot show you amen
[1:29:29] John
[1:29:30] said and I John saw these things and
[1:29:33] heard them and when I heard and seen I
[1:29:38] fell down to worship before the feet of
[1:29:41] the Angel which showed me these things
[1:29:44] meaning that when you were hear from
[1:29:48] heaven and if you see what you're going
[1:29:51] to be seeing from heaven from
[1:29:53] Heaven There is a temptation to worship
[1:29:56] the
[1:29:57] angel because things are so great
[1:30:00] brothers and sisters is the grace of God
[1:30:02] that keeps his bride in
[1:30:05] possession once you see things from
[1:30:08] Heaven you will be tempted to worship
[1:30:11] that angel but the bride won't because
[1:30:14] the bride can separate amen she has the
[1:30:18] word Jesus when he walked on the Earth
[1:30:22] people worshiped him and he never
[1:30:24] refused it never refused
[1:30:27] it he never pre prevented them from
[1:30:30] worshiping him
[1:30:33] why because both in the body in the
[1:30:37] spirit or
[1:30:40] God but the bride will come and say okay
[1:30:44] the body is my of my brethren
[1:30:47] yeah but the spirit inside is God Amen
[1:30:54] amen and nine says then sayith he unto
[1:30:59] me see thou do it not for I am thy
[1:31:03] fellow servant and thy Brethren the
[1:31:06] prophet and of them which keep the
[1:31:09] sayings of this book worship God the
[1:31:12] Brethren what is the
[1:31:14] Brethren I have the same thing with you
[1:31:19] guys for the one inside you can worship
[1:31:22] him because it's the spirit of
[1:31:26] testimony and he said unto me seal not
[1:31:30] seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
[1:31:32] this book for the time is at hand he
[1:31:36] that is unjust and he keeps on uh is let
[1:31:39] him be unjust still and he he which is
[1:31:43] filthy let him be filthy still and he
[1:31:45] that is righteous let him be righteous
[1:31:47] still and he that is Holy let him be
[1:31:50] holy still
[1:31:52] and
[1:31:53] behold that angel who was speak still
[1:31:56] talking and now he's identifying himself
[1:31:59] with God and behold I come
[1:32:02] quickly the
[1:32:08] spirit as we says we
[1:32:12] say you can know your
[1:32:17] identity the Jews knew that they were
[1:32:20] Jews Pilate know that he was not a Jew
[1:32:22] he was a
[1:32:23] Roman but did he know his position in
[1:32:27] the Fulfillment of the
[1:32:30] prophecy let put them aside you can say
[1:32:34] you are a Believer I can say I'm a
[1:32:37] Believer but do I know my position in
[1:32:40] the Fulfillment of the
[1:32:48] prophecy just think that an Egyptian
[1:32:53] could know the promise of God to
[1:32:56] Abraham could believe that promise of
[1:32:59] God to Abraham and his seed after him
[1:33:02] could even bleed his nose on the
[1:33:04] concrete believing it day and night he
[1:33:07] would do him
[1:33:09] nothing why because he's not in the
[1:33:14] Covenant because he's not in position
[1:33:17] that's not his
[1:33:19] position he can even change CH the
[1:33:22] nationality his citizenship said today
[1:33:24] I'm becoming a
[1:33:26] Jew but he's not in the
[1:33:35] Covenant oh how blessed are we to know
[1:33:39] that you are called to be
[1:33:41] Believers and then God has a position
[1:33:45] for each and every one of us in his body
[1:33:49] amen right in his kingdom
[1:33:53] amen the prophet of God says but oh how
[1:33:57] much more it is to walk when you know
[1:34:00] where you're
[1:34:02] walking where you are
[1:34:06] positioned how much it is to know what
[1:34:09] you are
[1:34:12] doing instead of
[1:34:14] Staggering stumbling along let's just
[1:34:18] stand up in the light and walk in the
[1:34:20] light and know know which way you're
[1:34:23] headed he said you've got to know your
[1:34:29] position you've got to know your
[1:34:32] place not only know that you are a
[1:34:35] Believer not only know that I am a
[1:34:38] Christian not only know that I'm message
[1:34:42] believer but to know your position will
[1:34:45] give you
[1:34:48] confidence to know your position will
[1:34:51] give give you
[1:34:53] authority to know your position will
[1:34:56] give you
[1:34:58] peace amen it's something that puts you
[1:35:02] to
[1:35:06] rest it's like you can be women's among
[1:35:11] 10,000 women standing
[1:35:15] somewhere I can just walk there said
[1:35:18] honey there's one that just will come up
[1:35:22] easily there's no scream there's no
[1:35:26] fasting there's nothing one little short
[1:35:30] lady will walk up there to
[1:35:33] me
[1:35:34] because she knows which position she
[1:35:38] is in My Little
[1:35:45] Kingdom so who unveils the
[1:35:49] identity it's the word
[1:35:52] Christ who unveils the the position in
[1:35:55] the body it's the Holy Spirit
[1:35:59] Christ so once your identity has been
[1:36:02] unveiled by the word let's listen we're
[1:36:06] winding down when your identity has been
[1:36:09] unveiled by the word you must know that
[1:36:13] you are about to fulfill a
[1:36:17] prophecy so when you just you have been
[1:36:21] identified as a
[1:36:24] Believer just know that since that time
[1:36:28] your place is waiting for you your spot
[1:36:31] is empty in this
[1:36:33] body it needs the prophecy is pending
[1:36:37] yeah that you will step into that
[1:36:40] position am to fulfill the
[1:36:43] prophecy because once you are identified
[1:36:46] you must be positioned amen
[1:36:50] right that's the reason once you are
[1:36:53] baptized by the Holy Ghost it puts you
[1:36:57] into
[1:36:58] position from which portion of the
[1:37:02] vision or a portion of the prophecy you
[1:37:05] will be
[1:37:07] fulfilling because God just did not
[1:37:10] create you to just come here and just be
[1:37:13] a
[1:37:15] loose a loose thing or a loose being he
[1:37:19] had a purpose for sending you here here
[1:37:21] he had a purpose for waiting and caring
[1:37:25] for you to come only in this
[1:37:29] generation and then he ordained his
[1:37:32] message to come and meet you in this
[1:37:34] generation Amen to continue his
[1:37:40] work else you wouldn't be here wouldn't
[1:37:43] be
[1:37:44] here you're here because he wanted you
[1:37:49] to be the shocking point is in all of
[1:37:53] our lives here for those are are
[1:37:56] probably more than 40 or 50 years just
[1:37:59] go back 30 or 40 years ago from 40 years
[1:38:03] ago and where you are today what have
[1:38:05] you done zero the place is placed you
[1:38:10] the if you're married the marriage is
[1:38:12] placed you in the fellowship he placed
[1:38:14] you in you had no clue you didn't look
[1:38:17] for that you didn't work out nothing but
[1:38:21] you finding yourself in that
[1:38:25] position
[1:38:27] meaning he has been leading
[1:38:30] you you problem couldn't even put
[1:38:33] anything together it's been leading you
[1:38:35] step by step you don't know which way
[1:38:37] why did you have to go this why you have
[1:38:39] to go this way and you finding up oh I'm
[1:38:42] finding up in a myself in a position but
[1:38:45] he wants you now to recognize it cuz
[1:38:48] once you recognize it the prophecies is
[1:38:51] easy for you to
[1:38:55] fulfill Jesus came the prophet of God
[1:38:58] said Jesus came he knew who he
[1:39:01] was when he went down there to the grave
[1:39:04] of Lazarus after the father had showed
[1:39:06] him a vision told him to leave the house
[1:39:09] of Lazarus was gone for 4 days they sent
[1:39:12] for him he didn't go back he knew what
[1:39:15] was going to happen after the time
[1:39:17] fulfilled the vision he said friend
[1:39:21] Lazarus sleepeth I go wake him when he
[1:39:24] gets to the Grave he said I thank you
[1:39:27] Father that you have all already heard
[1:39:30] me sure he was crying when he went to
[1:39:33] the Grave he was in sympathy with the
[1:39:36] people but when he got to the Grave
[1:39:38] there there wasn't a doubt in his
[1:39:42] mind said father I thank thee because
[1:39:46] you already heard
[1:39:49] me Jesus knew who he was and in that
[1:39:53] time when Lazarus was about to die Jesus
[1:39:55] could not be there because the prophecy
[1:39:58] would not be fulfilled it had to be he
[1:40:01] had to step away as the prophet of God
[1:40:03] said that if God gives gave me a vision
[1:40:06] and this this this suit has to be laying
[1:40:10] there if you take it there the prophecy
[1:40:13] is hanging yeah the vision is hanging it
[1:40:16] it would not f it would not work it
[1:40:18] would not it would stop amen
[1:40:21] waiting until this is
[1:40:26] there just think that your life it's
[1:40:29] waiting until we we might be here all of
[1:40:32] us yeah it's the prophecy is pending
[1:40:35] over you and me amen until you're here
[1:40:39] yeah right
[1:40:46] amen why he knew where he was
[1:40:49] standing
[1:40:51] he was he knew that he was the anointed
[1:40:54] Christ he knew he had God's word he knew
[1:40:59] that what God showed him was the
[1:41:01] truth and that same
[1:41:07] word and he promised it to
[1:41:11] you the same word that could identify
[1:41:14] him as the Son of God this is my beloved
[1:41:17] Son in which I dwell could identify him
[1:41:20] like that
[1:41:21] and position him in such a way that he
[1:41:23] would be a lamb to be
[1:41:25] slain to redeem you and me the same word
[1:41:29] that that placed that that prophesied of
[1:41:32] him like that is been given to you and
[1:41:34] me am
[1:41:38] right
[1:41:40] amen so Jesus was the son of
[1:41:44] God but was to stand as a
[1:41:47] sacrifice in position we man have time
[1:41:51] to go do that but you will find out that
[1:41:53] even Adam before the fall Adam knew who
[1:41:59] his identity
[1:42:01] was and knew his
[1:42:04] position amen before the fall I'm just
[1:42:08] skipping some here because we I take
[1:42:11] time let's let's let's go to to the Book
[1:42:14] of
[1:42:19] Genesis
[1:42:28] Book of Genesis chapter
[1:42:30] 2 back again from to the
[1:42:44] beginning now if you go to Genesis 2: 19
[1:42:48] it
[1:42:49] says and out of the ground the Lord God
[1:42:52] formed every beast of the field and
[1:42:55] every fowl of the air and brought them
[1:42:58] unto Adam to
[1:43:01] see what God is becoming a
[1:43:05] detective God is becoming brother Ben
[1:43:08] Ben
[1:43:10] seabo
[1:43:13] investigating God is detecting now
[1:43:16] said and brought them unto Adam to see
[1:43:21] what he would call
[1:43:23] them and whatsoever Adam called every
[1:43:26] living creature that was the name
[1:43:29] thereof 20 said and Adam gave names to
[1:43:33] all cattle and to the foul of the air
[1:43:35] and to every beast of the field but for
[1:43:38] Adam there was not found an help meat
[1:43:40] for
[1:43:41] him now when God told Adam Adam you name
[1:43:47] the animals and the fowls Adam did not
[1:43:51] go to God and said God I haven't done it
[1:43:54] before how how how do you do it how can
[1:43:58] I do it he never questioned God no Adam
[1:44:03] knew his identity when God created him
[1:44:06] he said he was created in God's image
[1:44:09] Adam knew that I'm God's image I'm
[1:44:12] reflecting everything that God is I'm
[1:44:15] reflecting right now he had the
[1:44:17] Revelation the present tense of
[1:44:19] revelation of who he was he didn't say
[1:44:22] hey I haven't done this before how how
[1:44:25] it's done how can I do it no he stood
[1:44:33] there and
[1:44:35] whatsoever God
[1:44:37] was Adam was whatsoever God
[1:44:42] did Adam did yes and what he did he
[1:44:46] stood in position he knew that I and my
[1:44:50] father we are in
[1:44:51] harmony since we're in harmony I'm not
[1:44:54] going to move I'm going to just stay in
[1:44:56] my
[1:44:56] position he he he break a
[1:45:00] vision right he didn't Panic he knew
[1:45:03] that because he wants me to name the
[1:45:06] animals and his life is within me I'm
[1:45:09] His Image and I know that he has to he's
[1:45:14] obligated Hallelujah he's obligated to
[1:45:18] show me a vision
[1:45:21] I can do that he stood there and God had
[1:45:24] to show him like the second Adam Jesus
[1:45:27] he could do nothing until the father
[1:45:30] showed him Adam did the same thing
[1:45:33] waited in Genesis for God to show him
[1:45:36] and to do that amen because he was
[1:45:40] given the placing the position to subdue
[1:45:43] the
[1:45:44] Earth and he could not subdue the Earth
[1:45:47] by his own something else since the he
[1:45:50] was the image reflecting
[1:45:53] God God was to be subd subduing the
[1:45:58] Earth through him am he stood stood in
[1:46:01] his
[1:46:05] position so when God put him there in
[1:46:08] Genesis 2 into the Garden of Eden he put
[1:46:12] him into
[1:46:13] position and Adam had to stay in his
[1:46:18] position the prophet of God says this in
[1:46:21] the message Jehovah Gyra preached in
[1:46:26] 1961 oh if you could only realize that
[1:46:31] you
[1:46:33] men you were made to be an amateur
[1:46:39] God do you remember the one who could
[1:46:42] see who knew every n that was on the
[1:46:46] earth who could see how many times they
[1:46:49] would bath their
[1:46:51] eyes now the word of God if you're
[1:46:55] hearing it from Heaven it's a different
[1:46:57] but if you're hearing it from here
[1:46:59] different as well but we want to hear it
[1:47:01] from Heaven he's saying that if you were
[1:47:06] made that he said if you could only
[1:47:11] realize that you men you and me were
[1:47:16] made to be an amateur of that infinite
[1:47:20] God
[1:47:23] you are a son of God that's your
[1:47:27] identity you are an heir of God that's
[1:47:30] your
[1:47:32] placing you are a son but not not a
[1:47:35] loose son in his kingdom you are an heir
[1:47:40] that's the position once you know that
[1:47:41] position Satan can come any
[1:47:45] time and try to attack you you know in
[1:47:49] your position that you are an air you
[1:47:51] will not
[1:47:52] shake you will not
[1:47:55] Shake he said yeah you can bring your
[1:47:57] sickness that's right but you know one
[1:48:00] one thing I'm in a
[1:48:02] prophecy if that that sickness was
[1:48:06] ordained to fulfill my prophecy you
[1:48:09] bring it on but God will prove to
[1:48:11] you stay there in your
[1:48:15] position something might come to us that
[1:48:17] we don't desire it could be ordaining
[1:48:21] your prophecy wouldn't you be glad to be
[1:48:23] standing with that in your prophecy
[1:48:26] fulfilling it
[1:48:29] happily and he said you are a son of God
[1:48:33] you are an heir of God and you have a
[1:48:36] Dominion Genesis 1:26 he gave him
[1:48:40] dominion over everything in the earth he
[1:48:43] made him a God over the Earth that's
[1:48:47] right he give him a Dominion gave him a
[1:48:50] Dominion Dominion domain he is a
[1:48:54] king not him the greatest god a son yeah
[1:48:59] he is a king a small King he is a God he
[1:49:04] could speak the trees be changed be pled
[1:49:07] up and set over there the winds and the
[1:49:11] waves be still he was a god an amateure
[1:49:15] God a Son of God like you are a son of
[1:49:19] your father then listen he said and all
[1:49:23] the world is groaning waiting to the
[1:49:27] manifestation of the sons of God waiting
[1:49:30] for the church to get back in its place
[1:49:33] again yes brother we're here this
[1:49:36] message has come not only to identify us
[1:49:39] as a Believer but to take us back to our
[1:49:42] position as am as
[1:49:45] God this message has come to make you
[1:49:49] and me the ruler in the Book of
[1:49:52] Revelation might don't have time he said
[1:49:54] we were made King and Priests we're not
[1:49:57] called only to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:50:00] God we called that's our identification
[1:50:03] our unveiled identity amen but our
[1:50:07] position our placing is that we are Sons
[1:50:11] and Daughters of God but we have a
[1:50:13] domain amen we're Kings and Priests
[1:50:17] right and as we walk on this Earth
[1:50:20] with faith our focus should be on
[1:50:25] that God I am a
[1:50:29] king I am a
[1:50:31] priest just remember that slave from
[1:50:35] Africa a bunch of slaves there eating
[1:50:39] garlics like everybody like everyone
[1:50:42] else but they noticed that he was
[1:50:48] different and until the bio said are you
[1:50:51] feeding him differently no he eats
[1:50:53] garlics with everybody else he gets his
[1:50:56] whips too like everybody
[1:50:59] else but there was something different
[1:51:02] about him though he was an
[1:51:05] alien he knew that back home where he
[1:51:07] came from he was a son of the king amen
[1:51:11] and he conducted himself like a son of a
[1:51:14] king So once you know that you are a
[1:51:16] king you will walk on this earth like a
[1:51:19] king right not full of Glory in humility
[1:51:22] knowing your position amen right a
[1:51:26] priest that you can intercede for any
[1:51:29] everybody that's right on Earth amen
[1:51:32] once your identity has been fully
[1:51:36] unveiled it places you into your
[1:51:39] position we don't have time to go the
[1:51:41] time is sleeping Abraham once God
[1:51:45] unveiled his identity that you will
[1:51:48] never be called Abram but but you will
[1:51:50] be called
[1:51:51] Abraham something happened in the
[1:51:54] following
[1:51:56] verses once God attached his nature his
[1:52:00] very life to the life of this servant
[1:52:03] Abraham and said you your name will be
[1:52:06] called Abraham Abraham knew his position
[1:52:10] he became immediately an inter
[1:52:15] intercessor he became immediately A
[1:52:17] righteous judge
[1:52:20] who would correct God said would
[1:52:24] you and when God was about to go back
[1:52:28] to Sodom and Gomorrah with the other two
[1:52:32] angels this man who has his name just
[1:52:35] got
[1:52:36] changed his identity just got unveiled
[1:52:40] he said God could you wait a second you
[1:52:43] don't go let the other Angels Go
[1:52:46] something is boiling within me because
[1:52:49] he was always an intered interceder or a
[1:52:52] righteous judge he knew his position
[1:52:55] right away he
[1:52:58] said and God said oh you know what I
[1:53:02] cannot hide anything from you Amos 47
[1:53:06] you are a prophet my
[1:53:08] son I cannot hide anything from you I
[1:53:11] have to reveal it to you you are a
[1:53:13] prophet I'm
[1:53:15] obligated I'm going there to Sodom and
[1:53:17] gomorra to burn it and Abraham started
[1:53:23] interceding
[1:53:24] interceding said God would do that onto
[1:53:29] a righteous judge this is a
[1:53:32] man who was a few years ago an idol
[1:53:38] worshippers but his identity has been so
[1:53:40] much unveiled in such power that it
[1:53:43] placed him right away as a righteous
[1:53:45] judge who can correct God he didn't
[1:53:48] correct God it was God in Abraham
[1:53:52] continuing his
[1:53:56] work in such a way he said even if you
[1:53:59] find
[1:54:02] 10 he knew
[1:54:05] God Ruth is inside
[1:54:08] there Ruth is in lot
[1:54:12] there if you kill lot there's no Ruth
[1:54:15] There's No
[1:54:16] Redemption I have boas but Ruth is there
[1:54:27] right we have been called to be
[1:54:30] rulers
[1:54:34] Governors if there was a school of
[1:54:36] Governors I would start going to that
[1:54:40] school because that's what I have been
[1:54:43] called to
[1:54:44] be if there was a a school for rulers of
[1:54:49] the Earth how to rule the Earth how to
[1:54:51] govern the earth I would go to that
[1:54:54] school but we have it
[1:54:57] already the message has come to give at
[1:54:59] that school
[1:55:01] am has given us the Holy Spirit and
[1:55:04] Liberty how how to how to
[1:55:07] live amen Our Lives they've been putting
[1:55:12] cameras in every room every place in the
[1:55:14] offices we don't need that you might not
[1:55:17] have any camera around
[1:55:20] I've been exposed to
[1:55:22] Heaven my life is exposed wherever I
[1:55:26] am
[1:55:27] am know how you Worship in your your
[1:55:30] your
[1:55:31] shower nothing on worshiping God cuz the
[1:55:35] heaven is open to
[1:55:37] you said God here I am I'm empty as I
[1:55:41] can be but some something inside deep
[1:55:44] inside of me that's attached to
[1:55:48] you
[1:55:53] amen we have that's too many things I
[1:55:55] have to skip them brother BR says that
[1:55:57] there two two classes of people you
[1:56:00] remember that one is
[1:56:03] fundamentalist and one
[1:56:05] Pentecost but when he's speaking he will
[1:56:08] always tell you that he would said the
[1:56:11] the F fundamentalist
[1:56:13] positionally
[1:56:16] positionally they know the
[1:56:18] position
[1:56:20] but one thing they're lacking they're
[1:56:22] not
[1:56:23] identified God has not identified them
[1:56:26] within them supp positionally knows
[1:56:29] where they
[1:56:31] stand but they have never received the
[1:56:35] Holy
[1:56:36] Ghost to be
[1:56:39] identified for your identity to be
[1:56:43] unveiled you must receive the Holy
[1:56:47] Ghost else
[1:56:50] we will be
[1:56:53] presuming and with presumption you will
[1:56:57] never get recognize your
[1:57:00] place you must it is you know what it it
[1:57:05] has to be a
[1:57:08] cry within you never be satisfied by
[1:57:13] anything less than
[1:57:15] that I remember Rachel the wife to to to
[1:57:21] to to
[1:57:24] Jacob she couldn't give birth when Leah
[1:57:27] was giving birth and the servants giving
[1:57:29] birth her servant giving birth she came
[1:57:32] to a spot she looked at Jacob in face he
[1:57:35] said if you don't give me a child I'm
[1:57:40] dying has to come at such level for
[1:57:43] every Christian every son and every
[1:57:45] daughter of God said you know what I
[1:57:46] don't want to
[1:57:48] pretend if you don't give me the Holy
[1:57:51] Ghost I'm going to die yes such a
[1:57:54] serious
[1:57:55] matter once you come to that level even
[1:57:59] your service will
[1:58:02] change coming to
[1:58:04] church will have a different
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:12] meaning fundamentalists positionally
[1:58:15] know where they stand but they have
[1:58:17] never received the Holy Ghost
[1:58:19] so they haven't got any faith of what
[1:58:22] they
[1:58:24] know that's right and the Pentecostal
[1:58:27] has received the Holy
[1:58:30] Ghost but don't positionally know who
[1:58:33] they are is the prophet of God said put
[1:58:36] them together it's like somebody knows
[1:58:38] how to write a check and someone doesn't
[1:58:40] have the money someone knows how to
[1:58:43] write a check without money in the
[1:58:44] account and someone has a a money in his
[1:58:47] bank account and not knowing how to
[1:58:49] write check put them
[1:58:51] together something will happen but the
[1:58:53] prophet of God comes to this that's
[1:58:55] lesson that's where I coming to he
[1:58:58] doesn't mention the fundamentalist in
[1:59:02] this because
[1:59:04] fundamentalists they are lacking
[1:59:06] something they're
[1:59:08] lacking the Holy Spirit they have not
[1:59:11] received the Holy
[1:59:12] Spirit once you have not received the
[1:59:15] Holy Spirit the door is still closed so
[1:59:18] he's not talking about those he's
[1:59:20] talking about the
[1:59:22] Pentecostal which have already received
[1:59:25] the word the Holy Ghost then there's a
[1:59:27] room to move to go
[1:59:29] further
[1:59:30] amen just think that all the blessings
[1:59:33] all the position the placing that God
[1:59:35] wants to you to be inher uh air to that
[1:59:40] or
[1:59:41] inheriting the only door that can be
[1:59:46] opened is once you receive the baptism
[1:59:48] of the Holy Ghost ghost not the mockery
[1:59:50] one the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:53] in your
[1:59:55] life the word will take on a different
[2:00:01] meaning you will have that
[2:00:04] responsibility in your neighborhood
[2:00:07] wherever you are you not the
[2:00:10] god what do you want me to do at this
[2:00:13] place people are walking in doing this
[2:00:16] maybe a gas station Lord do you have
[2:00:18] anybody I can pray
[2:00:20] for that young man is struggling there
[2:00:23] father I don't know maybe his family
[2:00:25] maybe his relative Lord is is there any
[2:00:28] Grace on him father would you do
[2:00:30] something as even I walk there even if
[2:00:33] he cannot understand maybe he might be
[2:00:35] out of his mind
[2:00:37] father this is the age of our
[2:00:40] shadows should be counted
[2:00:44] in your
[2:00:46] Shadow should be counting that God I do
[2:00:49] not know what you would do with my
[2:00:53] shadow my life has to be so open so
[2:00:58] dedicated so Sanctified that whatever
[2:01:00] you want to do with it you do
[2:01:06] it he said if Pentecost Pentecostal
[2:01:10] people could only
[2:01:12] realize not the
[2:01:14] fundamentalist fundamentalists they
[2:01:17] don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:20] but once you have the baptism of the
[2:01:22] Holy Ghost God is accounting you as a
[2:01:25] Pentecostal because you have an
[2:01:26] experience of the
[2:01:28] Pentecost now with that experience he
[2:01:32] wants you to realize your
[2:01:35] position he said if Pentecostal people
[2:01:38] could only realize that they are not the
[2:01:41] scum of the Earth but they are Sons and
[2:01:46] Daughters identified first of God
[2:01:51] hes of all things through
[2:01:54] Christ you are an heir once you step
[2:01:57] into that door of the the true not the
[2:02:00] mockery Holy Ghost the true baptism of
[2:02:02] the Holy
[2:02:03] Ghost just look up said I'm an
[2:02:07] heir none of tiny
[2:02:10] things an heir of all
[2:02:17] things you might be
[2:02:19] you might be the righteous judge in your
[2:02:22] city said God I don't know how many
[2:02:24] messy Believers are here in this
[2:02:28] area when you look at this city where
[2:02:30] would your eyes go let my home be where
[2:02:33] your eyes could rest let my heart be
[2:02:36] where your eyes could
[2:02:38] rest let my thoughts be where your eyes
[2:02:41] could rest Let My Words everything where
[2:02:44] my your your your eyes could
[2:02:47] rest
[2:02:54] and he
[2:02:55] says but as long as Satan can keep you
[2:02:58] afraid to claim your inheritance then
[2:03:01] he's got
[2:03:05] you as long as you are afraid don't be
[2:03:08] afraid of any word that that God wrote
[2:03:11] for just hang your faith on any
[2:03:15] punctuation yes
[2:03:17] sir that's in the that's that's in there
[2:03:22] because it's
[2:03:27] right it's exactly right so knowing your
[2:03:31] position once you have been
[2:03:33] identified by the word of your
[2:03:38] day once it's been revealed to
[2:03:42] you you can recognize who you are in
[2:03:46] this great body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:50] CH let's read
[2:03:52] uh in the message the believer's
[2:03:55] position in
[2:03:57] Christ 1955 the prophet of God
[2:04:00] said we have got to
[2:04:03] do what God has revealed to
[2:04:08] us he has to reveal once we are born
[2:04:12] into that Kingdom we're born of
[2:04:15] him he is in the obligation to reveal to
[2:04:21] us what our position
[2:04:23] is how do I know it it's your kingdom
[2:04:27] you you birth me into it where is my
[2:04:30] position what would you want me to do
[2:04:33] Paul asked the same
[2:04:35] thing what would you want me to do now
[2:04:39] as you converted me as you met me what
[2:04:43] do you want me to do
[2:04:47] now brother brother Graham is doing that
[2:04:51] God has revealed to him a a worldwide
[2:04:54] Revival and he's making a good show of
[2:04:57] it too I appreciate him and I'm trying
[2:05:00] my best by the Revelation that God has
[2:05:03] given me to minister to the sick
[2:05:06] people to what he told me to
[2:05:09] do so God had told the prophet to do he
[2:05:14] put him in position go pray for the sick
[2:05:16] and do this he was positioned
[2:05:19] because he had an
[2:05:22] experience without that true
[2:05:25] experience there's no position to be
[2:05:28] known you're going to be just a
[2:05:36] floater now if we can find our
[2:05:39] position is the prophet saying it and
[2:05:42] know what it's God word and know that
[2:05:46] it's God's word that has promised proed
[2:05:49] it that's the reason Joshua and Caleb
[2:05:52] had no fear that they could take the
[2:05:54] promised land because not only they had
[2:05:57] that
[2:05:58] experience but they knew their
[2:06:01] position in that
[2:06:04] Kingdom the prophet of God says this
[2:06:06] winding
[2:06:08] down in the message
[2:06:12] why we are what we
[2:06:16] are and don't let us not hear it from
[2:06:21] Earth let's hear it from
[2:06:24] heaven we are what we are and that's one
[2:06:28] thing that has hurt our Pentecostal move
[2:06:32] and other moves it is somebody trying to
[2:06:36] be something that they are
[2:06:38] not do let's not do
[2:06:44] that they are trying to impersonate
[2:06:48] someone one else you can't do that
[2:06:52] you're just what you
[2:06:54] are that's all and when you do that God
[2:06:58] will use you in just what you are don't
[2:07:02] say I have to become this I have to be
[2:07:04] this God will use you just the way you
[2:07:11] are and you are just as important as
[2:07:17] anybody else I love that that equality
[2:07:21] of Sons and Daughters of
[2:07:24] God you are just as important once you
[2:07:28] birth into that Kingdom you are just as
[2:07:31] important as anybody
[2:07:34] else in that
[2:07:38] Kingdom as I said the other night the
[2:07:41] little bitty hairspring in this watch is
[2:07:46] just as important as the main
[2:07:50] spring cuz it takes it all together to
[2:07:53] make
[2:07:54] time when we
[2:07:57] realize our position in
[2:08:00] Christ and then abide in that
[2:08:05] position it's just a little
[2:08:10] housewi if it's just a little
[2:08:13] housewife just stay
[2:08:17] there
[2:08:19] don't pretend don't expect to be
[2:08:21] something big in that position if it's
[2:08:23] just a little
[2:08:26] housewife stay right
[2:08:29] there that's what God wants you to do
[2:08:33] see just be who you
[2:08:36] are you don't have to
[2:08:38] turn Ephesians 1 1 Paul mention just in
[2:08:43] one
[2:08:45] sentence Paul an apostle of Jesus Jesus
[2:08:48] Christ by the will of God to the Saints
[2:08:52] he
[2:08:53] identified to whom he was
[2:08:57] speaking which are at e Ephesus and to
[2:09:02] the faithful in Christ not only he was
[2:09:05] talking to those he identified them and
[2:09:08] he placed them in Christ amen your I
[2:09:13] unveiled true unveiled
[2:09:17] identity will position you in the body
[2:09:21] of Christ am with no doubt amen it's
[2:09:25] something he has once you birth into
[2:09:27] that Kingdom he sealed you with his holy
[2:09:30] spirit he has the obligation to place
[2:09:33] you amen that you can know your position
[2:09:36] in in the
[2:09:38] body so brother BR picks it picked it up
[2:09:40] in uh the message believer's position he
[2:09:43] said Paul wasn't preaching here to the
[2:09:46] unsaved he was preaching ing it to the
[2:09:49] saved the called out the separated the
[2:09:54] set aside and the faithful in the core
[2:09:57] now that's who he addresses it
[2:10:01] to the believer's position is in
[2:10:07] Christ you will never have the greatest
[2:10:10] position you will ever have in in life
[2:10:12] it's in Christ amen and for you to have
[2:10:15] it you must be born again
[2:10:19] again you must be filled with his holy
[2:10:24] ghost as we heard it last Sunday then
[2:10:27] you are a witness into that
[2:10:29] body you will witness that I am a toe
[2:10:32] you will witness that I am a hand you
[2:10:35] will witness that I'm a navor you will
[2:10:37] witness I'm a hair in that
[2:10:45] body and Christ will only meet the
[2:10:48] believer not the
[2:10:53] unbelievers and the believer can only
[2:10:55] worship Christ as is positionally placed
[2:11:00] in Christ that is that is critical amen
[2:11:05] how would God receive your worship when
[2:11:07] you are born
[2:11:10] again the believer let's listen to that
[2:11:13] as we're winding
[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:16] down the believer can only worship
[2:11:21] Christ just think how you as a Believer
[2:11:24] I am a believer how can we worship
[2:11:29] Christ as he is positionally placed in
[2:11:35] Christ amen outside of your
[2:11:38] position there's no
[2:11:46] worship outside the your your position
[2:11:49] there's no
[2:11:53] worship cuz you might be too high up
[2:11:56] Jesus sitting here you up there how are
[2:11:58] you going to worship Him looking down to
[2:12:02] him but at his feet if he's sitting you
[2:12:07] have an opportunity and more room to
[2:12:10] worship Him by being down looking up to
[2:12:17] him and he said no man has no
[2:12:22] right to Worship the Lord
[2:12:26] outside of being in the body of the Lord
[2:12:29] Jesus
[2:12:34] Christ did we hear that yeah let me read
[2:12:37] it
[2:12:39] again no
[2:12:42] man this man means a woman children
[2:12:45] grownup elderly everybody included no
[2:12:49] man has no right there's no right for
[2:12:53] that man to Worship the Lord
[2:12:58] outside of being in the body of the Lord
[2:13:02] Jesus
[2:13:03] Christ right now how do we enter into
[2:13:07] that
[2:13:08] body by a new birth amen by the Holy
[2:13:12] Ghost once you are sealed in the kingdom
[2:13:16] of God with the true baptism of the Holy
[2:13:20] Ghost you become a candidate to
[2:13:27] worship because you can only worship Him
[2:13:31] in your position in your land amen
[2:13:35] children of Israel when they went back
[2:13:37] to their Homeland every Ephraim has to
[2:13:40] be in his land Amen manasse in his land
[2:13:44] everyone that's from there you can
[2:13:47] worship outside of your land there's no
[2:13:50] worship
[2:13:54] amen and we desire to worship
[2:13:59] him if we're burn born
[2:14:03] again then we
[2:14:06] find the channel for us to worship
[2:14:15] him and then let me read this one there
[2:14:19] was a question asked brother
[2:14:22] brandham as musicians I don't know if
[2:14:25] you can start coming the time is
[2:14:27] slipping
[2:14:30] by a question and question answered how
[2:14:33] does one know their rightful position in
[2:14:37] the body of
[2:14:39] Christ I would I want to know that
[2:14:43] everybody here would like to know that
[2:14:45] right how does one one know their
[2:14:49] rightful position in the body of Christ
[2:14:52] because only in this
[2:14:56] position your worship could be
[2:15:00] received outside of this
[2:15:04] position we're just
[2:15:06] singing we're just
[2:15:08] talking we just pleasing our
[2:15:12] lips pleasing our
[2:15:14] neighbors pleasing the pastor and the
[2:15:17] Believers
[2:15:18] it's only in this position my given
[2:15:22] position that I can truly worship that
[2:15:26] God could receive my
[2:15:28] worship outside of
[2:15:30] that we have no
[2:15:39] right that's a good one very
[2:15:43] good that's the
[2:15:46] prophet that would be the kind of
[2:15:49] question amongst many of us here
[2:15:54] tonight how do you rightfully
[2:15:57] know now I'm presuming that this brother
[2:16:01] wants to know what
[2:16:03] position what in Christ what part of
[2:16:08] Christ do I
[2:16:10] play a good question that any sensible
[2:16:14] any believer would ask and glad that
[2:16:18] somebody asked it on my behalf and on
[2:16:20] your behalf
[2:16:23] too and the prophet of God goes now for
[2:16:26] instance I would say like this brother
[2:16:30] to give you the best answer I
[2:16:33] know your position in Christ is revealed
[2:16:38] to
[2:16:39] you by the Holy
[2:16:46] Ghost
[2:16:49] you see why we need the holy ghost from
[2:16:52] him not the Holy Ghost made by man or
[2:16:56] somebody told me I have it or maybe I
[2:16:58] had the Shivering something happened I
[2:17:00] give to myself okay you gave yourself
[2:17:03] but which position he placed you in yeah
[2:17:07] what did he tell you about your position
[2:17:09] because the prophet said your position
[2:17:11] in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy
[2:17:15] Ghost yes and then if you want to know
[2:17:19] whether it's the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit
[2:17:21] or not find out whether He blesses what
[2:17:26] you are doing or not am but watch out
[2:17:31] cuz sometimes we can take our fortive
[2:17:34] world and be
[2:17:37] blessed we won't go further with that it
[2:17:41] will crack somewhere yeah right 30 years
[2:17:44] it doesn't care it will crack 40 years
[2:17:47] it will crack yeah amen let him do
[2:17:55] that and the prophet of God says in the
[2:17:57] future home winding down and if you are
[2:18:00] the
[2:18:01] bride the Bride is a part of the
[2:18:05] husband and the only place that you will
[2:18:07] ever recognize it is recognize what part
[2:18:11] of that husband that word you are or you
[2:18:16] can't recognize being the bright how
[2:18:19] many see that see you have to recognize
[2:18:23] your
[2:18:26] position I play something
[2:18:28] soft I've got to
[2:18:32] stop would you stand up brothers and
[2:18:46] sisters I was just
[2:18:49] thinking as you Ponder on
[2:18:52] this let it be something that speaking
[2:18:55] to
[2:18:57] you not from
[2:19:01] this beaten up
[2:19:04] man but hear these words I cannot even
[2:19:08] put together in vocabulary hear it from
[2:19:12] Heaven if you hear it from
[2:19:14] Heaven you will see things that no one
[2:19:17] beside you can show
[2:19:19] you cuz you know what is inside of that
[2:19:23] door you know who is sitting inside
[2:19:26] there whether it's somebody's sitting
[2:19:28] there or it's
[2:19:29] empty but it will never be empty because
[2:19:33] Pride could be sitting
[2:19:36] there arrogancy could be sitting
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:42] there big plans could be sitting there
[2:19:45] big
[2:19:46] projects
[2:19:48] but how far would they
[2:19:51] go the only thing as the prophet of God
[2:19:54] says anything that will come back into
[2:19:57] the resurrection is something that had a
[2:20:00] purpose from
[2:20:02] God if that big project big plan big
[2:20:06] thought of you is not in the purpose of
[2:20:11] God it's a wasting of
[2:20:14] time it's
[2:20:16] empty
[2:20:19] just think about
[2:20:21] [Music]
[2:20:22] Moses he was the youngest of the
[2:20:25] family but by Sovereign Grace he was
[2:20:28] made a God to
[2:20:31] Pharaoh so coming to religious
[2:20:37] matters Miriam older sister Aaron older
[2:20:42] brother they were looking up to their
[2:20:44] youngest brother because he was the be
[2:20:47] God to Egypt they had to take heed to
[2:20:51] his
[2:20:53] words but when they have family
[2:20:55] gathering Moses has no word to say he
[2:20:57] has to look up at Aaron and Miriam what
[2:20:59] are you
[2:21:00] saying there's always a
[2:21:06] paradox
[2:21:09] God my has chosen to speak to you this
[2:21:12] morning you know where you are and you
[2:21:15] know who is inside of your heart
[2:21:19] I might be here like a little Moses not
[2:21:22] comparing us
[2:21:24] to but there's a little big God
[2:21:30] here at this place holy place that uh
[2:21:33] has chosen to reveal and unveil himself
[2:21:37] to us
[2:21:38] here why won't you take this
[2:21:42] opportunity as we bow our heads we close
[2:21:46] our eyes
[2:21:48] just don't rush to go
[2:21:51] home would you would you speak to him
[2:21:55] would you just knowing that
[2:21:59] God you will never receive my
[2:22:04] worship if I do not have that Holy
[2:22:07] Ghost if I am not in my ordained
[2:22:11] position placed in my
[2:22:16] position
[2:22:17] could I be wasting time thinking
[2:22:21] presuming that I'm worshiping you when
[2:22:25] nothing is being received on your
[2:22:27] [Music]
[2:22:28] end could I be going with so much
[2:22:34] effort knowing that it's just
[2:22:39] empty Lord one word from
[2:22:43] you one experience from you will place
[2:22:46] me me into your
[2:22:49] worship when if the Holy Ghost will
[2:22:53] baptize me and bring your presence your
[2:22:58] life into my
[2:23:02] heart I know which door I can knock
[2:23:05] on every day and every
[2:23:12] morning
[2:23:15] Lord just pray him in your own
[2:23:18] way and just said
[2:23:22] God if this is that time for
[2:23:26] me I don't want this to slip
[2:23:31] by I'm forgetting about the one who's
[2:23:33] sitting close to
[2:23:35] me I'm forgetting about the one who's
[2:23:37] sitting in front of me on my back I'm
[2:23:42] forgetting Lord this is a serious matter
[2:23:46] because
[2:23:47] I want to worship you you created me to
[2:23:50] worship you but I realize that worship
[2:23:53] has a
[2:23:54] condition I cannot meet that condition
[2:23:57] on my own it would take you to make me
[2:24:00] meet that
[2:24:02] condition
[2:24:04] father as I desire to worship you you
[2:24:08] are obligated to give me this
[2:24:11] life why don't you cry out of out to him
[2:24:14] for this
[2:24:16] life in your own way say Lord I want to
[2:24:20] meet the
[2:24:22] requirement because once I am in that
[2:24:27] body I can find my true place and my
[2:24:31] fellowship with you remember he wants to
[2:24:34] fellowship with you more than you we
[2:24:38] would but he wants it to
[2:24:41] be in his body and there is a
[2:24:45] requirement for that
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:50] positioned by the unveiled
[2:24:54] identity which identity has this message
[2:24:58] given to you which identity has this
[2:25:01] word revealed to
[2:25:04] you which position are you in right now
[2:25:08] after it has been revealed to you when
[2:25:10] Abraham Abram's identity was revealed
[2:25:13] right away he went into
[2:25:15] action when
[2:25:18] Mary that identity was revealed to her
[2:25:20] that you are the mother of the Lord she
[2:25:23] went into action she didn't not wait for
[2:25:26] days or hide for the Neighbors she went
[2:25:29] to action which action by the way
[2:25:32] brought back John the Baptist to
[2:25:34] life she recognized her
[2:25:37] position Lord this morning or this
[2:25:42] afternoon with my hand lifted up myself
[2:25:45] and my brothers lifted up
[2:25:47] we would want you to come and place us
[2:25:51] into a true worship to place us into
[2:25:54] this body where we can hear from heaven
[2:25:57] and see things from heaven and father
