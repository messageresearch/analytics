Kyle and I will be leaving for the Philippines in the morning we leave quite early in the morning and we'll be returning on Tuesday the 14th so please keep us in our prayer in your prayers we appreciate that they can send us an itinerary today and there's quite a few Services we'll be actually in the Philippines for somewhere around 10 to 11 days and between the two of us I think we have 10 or 11 services so we really appreciate your prayers while I'm gone that first Sunday and Wednesday Brother David Dean Hart will be ministering and then the second Sunday on the 12th brother Burley Williams will be ministering also want to remind you there won't be a second service this Sunday there'll be no communion and so pray for these brothers as well remember our families as well and we'll be remembering you and praying for you as well also it's a great pleasure I get to announce to you that after the service today we'll be having a baptism young Derek Siebert would like to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we're very excited for him and for his family and for what the Lord's doing in his in his life amen amen while we're standing let's look at at Mark chapter 11. we'll go to verse 22 and begin there and Jesus answered Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen God bless you as you take your seeds man this is a interesting scripture and I just want to springboard from here and use it as a foundation to get into my subject and and I just want to look at this for a minute uh he says in verse 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart so he can't be guessing there's no hoping that this will work out he cannot doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith so look at the conditions Jesus bases this on he says first of all you can say these things if you have no doubt in your heart and if you already know that the things you say will come to pass this can't be a speaking and seeing if it will happen then it won't work amen that this will not work it will only work if there's no doubt in your heart and that you know that the things that you say shall come to pass amen so we're going to get into this a little bit I just want you to hold on to that amen and and I want to minister tonight for a title I want to take character for the third pool so there's something I want to get into but I'm going to start off talking about the third pool and the spoken word and the manifestation of the third pool and I'm just going to uh go into some of the things brother Branham said and I'm going to start here with Look Away to Jesus in December of 1963. so what I'm I'm going into first is the third pool and what brother Branham said then I want to go into my subject character for the third poem amen so I'm going to read a few quotes here so stay stay tuned in don't tune out stay tuned in amen when you look at the top of my shiny bald head because I'm reading doesn't mean it's time for to be distracted and for your mind to wonder listen to what I'm saying amen Look Away to Jesus he says now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along and that is the thing that we've have looked forward to for so long for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pool has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existence and I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it just happens so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up so he begins to explain some things here he explains why this manifestation of the third pool or as he'll explain it later the spoken word has the reason that it's come on the scene and the reason has been displayed is what brother Branham says is so that it could identify its presence among you amen but it really wasn't intended till a future date but gone and listen I'll I'll just say this in my own words in my own way of explaining things and and God had to show it first and so it's coming but there has to be some conditions first Matt all right so this is what brother Brandon says now it it right at this time now it just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up so he's saying God showed it to you so he could identify its presence so you'd see it but it's really not intended for now it's intended for another time when the council begins to tighten up and when it does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifest in the fullness of its power so you see my my thought here God had to show it so it could identify its presence so we know it's here but it's not intended to be used or will not be used in a great way till the council tightens up and then when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily now show itself manifesting the fullness of its power all right then another quote a little further down and looking away look away to Jesus says now I must continue in evangelism just as I was commissioned first I must continue on therefore you've had the word and you know what to look for how to stand I must continue on in evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the hours approaching swiftly see that when something is going to be done Brother Bear never wanted us to stop he wanted to keep moving forward he said keep still and just keep moving on keep still and keep moving on it's amazing what he means is don't chase after nothing just keep still and keep moving on in the word this is at least my understanding of it now he says now you might see some little odd things happen happen for me nothing sinful I don't mean that but I mean something odd to what the regular Trend because where I reach to now in the ministry I'm dropping back here watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used so again brother Ben was telling us it's really not for now it's for another time but it had to identify itself among you amen but when this other thing happens then what you've seen temporarily will be manifest in the fullness of the power and I'm dropping back waiting because where I've got to in the ministry I can't go any farther I've got to wait for something else to happen are we are we together okay so I'm watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified so is the second been identified and if you'll think real closely you who are spiritual as the Bible said here is to him that has wisdom the third is properly identified see we know where it is so the third pool is here so we're not looking for anything because the third pool's already here it identified itself Among Us amen so that we would have confidence to wait until this other thing catches up brother random was he was he was he was here as a forerunner he was also here amen displaying what was going to to transpire he was the first part of the Harvest amen within him the word came to maturity amen and began to display what it's like to have a an adopted son of God a mature son and daughter of God on the scene and he was foreshadowing the rest of the crop and he displayed amen what he calls the spoken word that's part of the third pool amen and said that now I've gone as far in the ministry as I can go now I've got to wait for this thing to catch up because he knows he had to forerun and he had to go and show what's coming and then wait amen for something else to catch up and so uh I just wanna I wanna take a diversion I want to drop a couple quotes in here from 1965 because I don't want anybody amen sitting in their seat thinking but brother Chad he also said so let's read it now I know anyone's at the end time notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message and his message is revelation 10 1-7 the seven Thunders the opening of The Seven Seals when he's not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pool healing second pull prophesy the third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed so the third pull is the opening of the word but brother Branham also ties the third pull to the spoken word that was done five times in the creating of the squirrels twice amen speaking to Hattie writes two boys speaking to the Storm Into the tumor of his wife he also attaches it to that and calls it the spoken word so the third pool is the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word all right this is this to me is really important because he shows that the the the the the third pool is the opening of the word but there's also another aspect amen that's the spoken word amen and and you begin to realize what was laying under those seals what what was uh the opening of the seals and we begin to see that that the opening of the seals was unlocking the mystery that was in the back part of God's mind that he had kept with himself since before the foundation of the world and when he unlocked the mystery of himself it really it if I could say it this way uh the important thing in there was not the information that was released but the great hidden revelation that was released and the great hidden revelation amen was one that would bring a people into position and an understanding of who they really are and they would begin to understand that they are actually part of Christ amen that they were foreordained in the thoughts of God and they they possess within themselves a see Gene of God they were an attribute of God before the foundation of the world and they've been placed here in time to play the part amen of the bride and it will be Christ coming in the formation of his bride to manifest himself so under those seals broke away so much misunderstanding so that the people would finally understand who they are that's what the opening of the word did for a people on the Earth because the opening of the word couldn't do that for the generations that have passed on Amen they they lived their life under the portion that was allotted to them but it's for the people who are here at the end time amen the seals open and it took the seals off the off of our life all right so if we go back to our opening scripture that if there is going to be a manifestation of the third pool as a spoken word as it was in brother bantam's life then you have to be able to speak something without doubting it in your heart and knowing that what you're about to say will come to pass before you say it not not waiting until it comes to pass and then go tell everybody what happened no but you're the kind of faith that you have to go to for this operation is where there is no doubt in the heart and that you already know that it'll happen before spoken now how are you ever even capable of that under denominationalism when you're not sure if you're saved or not or if you're a child of God or not or if you're if you failed yesterday if you've got to go to the Altar and repent if you haven't repented am I saved that was Pentecostal doctor and I grew up in that if you sinned and died and didn't have a chance to repent you would be lost and go to hell how would you have this kind of faith if you don't know who you are amen but if you know who you are and that you come from God and you go back to God Amen and there there is something from God Amen attributed to you that you're containing and bottling confining amen the uh habitating God in some way in some measure then all of a sudden everything becomes possible that's why the third pool is the opening of the word and has an aspect of the spoken word attached to it now in the message what is the attraction on the mountain he says I heard her voice say that's the king sword and this is where brother Barnes and Sabino Canyon his hands are open the sword strikes his hand I said a king Knights a man with a sword and the voice came back said not a king sword but the king sword the word of the Lord said fear not it's only the third pool it's the Vindication of your ministry so the third pool was the sword in the hand what's the third in the hand it's it's the sword of the king which is the word of God placed in his hands so it's the word in his hands now remember amen when you go to Revelation 10 1-7 and you get to the seven Thunder seven Thunders under their voices and John was told right at night so there was a portion of scripture that wasn't written amen amen not even in symbol form brother Branham says and so now there has to be a word given into the hand of the Prophet Amen in the in the third pool is the opening of the word because it was locked in a mystery because John was told not to write it so it was sealed in the Bible as an Unwritten word amen although it was declared and typed throughout the Bible it was sealed as an Unwritten word and so now God has to be able to give that Unwritten word amen what John saw but didn't right he has to be able to give it to somebody so that sword has to come into somebody's hand so it comes into the prophetan and brother banham every day comes and takes zero credit whatsoever for the opening of a seal he says I was I know no more about it than anything I was just as lost as anybody I was reading other men's books and thought that they had it pretty good amen until he came till that angel came amen and brother Branham says he saw it as a vision so remember John Saul he heard the seven Thunders and he was told to write whatever he hears and whatever he sees now brother Branham is seeing in a vision the unfolding of a seal and he's just grabbing a paper and writing it down as it unfolds then he spends the rest of the day going back and tracing it through the scriptures that's why he comes to the end of the seals and says don't say thank you to any man he goes no man had anything to do with this this was none other than Jesus Christ himself giving the revelation of that mystery word so what Brethren could take zero credit for the opening of those seals he just saw it unfold day by day and as he saw it unfold he grabbed a pin and wrote it down and then spent the rest of the day tracing it out then he would come and preach at that night so you see the sword was placed in his hand it was the opening of the word now the word was given to him and now as he was speaking the unwritten part he had the spoken word that's how we have that's how we have the revelation of the seven Thunders is because he spoke it how did God give us the revelation of seven Thunders through that man's mouth so the third pool is the opening of the word amen now I want to go back to look away to Jesus because I want to tithe I wanted to make sure we tie these things to do things together the opening of the word and the spoken word as in this and the signs now back to look away to Jesus he says it's so sacred that I mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning this say nothing of it you remember years ago it speaks for itself I've tried to explain the others and I made a mistake this will be the thing to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away I must lay quiet for a little while now remember and who is listening to this tape you might see such a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at the age now and it can't be can't go any further we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes what's he waiting for the Council of churches the tightening up the squeeze is that right is that what he said now we have to wait a minute till this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified there is coming a Time upon the in this nation to where the nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before him which was Pagan Rome when it become papal room see that this nation will do that so he starts talking about the tightening up the squeeze he starts talking he goes right into Revelation 13 amen and the Beast and so he's tying all of this together then a little further down and look away to Jesus he says it's tightening and then when that time comes and the Press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the bride and the church in the message shalom in the beginning of 1964 this is just the next month it's just like two weeks later he says and we all know that that's the identification we know what the third pool is we we all understand that now you got you all have to the tape and I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on that's when it be it'll speak it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure squirrels twice had he writes boys speaking to the storm in Colorado into his wife's tumor it'll be manifest just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly and now I think just wait see to see what it done so it's amazing now I want to say this if you want me to tell you what it's going to be like I have no idea you want me to tell you exactly what he meant by what he said I can't but I know what he said to be true and I know it'll take care of itself okay there's been so much speculation about these things so many ideas and guess what I have my own ideas I have my own speculations and we've sit around table it's fun to talk about but when you really try to pin down what's going to happen what's a sequence event what's when this will happen and that will happen listen there's no way to figure this out because nothing ever happens the way we think it's going to happen if you look in the Bible the Fulfillment of every prophecy always came in an unusual way and never came the way people expected it so don't already have an idea one thing's for sure when it's time it will happen amen brother Brown says in the message shalom we heard the word say that in the days of the seventh angel in the church age he just said the seventh Angel's message would be the last message and then we find out over here in Revelation 10 and the days of the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of God should be finished the seventh seal would be pulled back it should be there then all at once when it happened a vision broke said go to Tucson a great noise will take place at this time so you'll be thoroughly understanding and know that it's sin it'll shake the Earth nearly all of you know about it it's on tape months before it happened then it happened then appeared in the sky Shalom what is it it's a changing beats the sympathy he's referring to a sympathy or something I'm sorry a symphony then one time he said about the third pool how it would come by this one way then by knowing the heart and then the spoken word so now you say he's going to the third pool and he's attaching it to the spoken word are these signs where he spoke to squirrels into existence in these things so he says one time he said about the third poll how would come by this one way then by knowing the heart so first by taking them by the hand then by knowing the heart through a gift of discernment and and then the spoken word I skipped a paragraph and he comes to the next one when we hear the sympathy beating changing fixing to change it's a junction time we notice as he begin to beat and we've seen the works that I do shall you do also and greater shall you do greater he promised it we wondered how it could be now remember brother Benham used to always say Greater Works he said greater because now that was done in one person that'll be done in the whole body it'll be more works he said that but now he's going to say something a little different about the Greater Works all right he says now Greater Works greater he promised we wondered how it could be how could you do Greater Works but did you notice when he performed his first miracle he took water and turned it into wine is that right he took water which potentially someday might have been wine but it was water first and when he fed five thousand what did he do he took something that had been like water he took fish that once swam and was born from an egg and he broke it and another fish growed into into the creation that was the original creation he took bread that was once wheat and was a seed and became bread and he broke from this bread and the creation only multiplied but in the woods there was nothing there to make a squirrel yeah now he's showing something about the Greater Works in the woods there was nothing there to make a squirrel now listen to what he says the next statement let there be where does that take you in the scriptures back to Genesis who said let there be God himself and what did he do he made in the beginning he made something all things were made out of things that you do not see out of things that don't exist so brother Brown ties this right back to the very beginning when God created the world amen he said let there be and there was without anything to break it from what is it the same Jesus Christ now brother man now just listen he said the same Jesus Christ he never pointed to himself these words came out of his lips but he never once took credit for the creation of squirrels for the moving of a storm for the healing of his wife's tumor for the Salvation of how he writes two boys so if brother Branham could create squirrels then it was brother Branham who saved those two boys but no man can save no sin-born man can save anybody else they're only saved by Jesus Christ so Brethren never takes credit for any of this even though it was his lips that spoke the words see greater things than this will you do for I go to my father not taking something that's been created breaking something from it and multiplying creation but absolutely create showing that he's the same Jehovah that stood back there and said let there be and there was his word was made manifest when he was made Flesh on Earth he took his original creation broke it back and multiplied it but now in the last days when he comes down Among Us the same light that moved down said let there be light see he just speak the creation into existence greater than this will you do for I go to my father remember we're at these times remember the opening of the seals revealed in Revelation 10 7 it revealed the mystery of God and was what was the great mystery of God what the great mystery of God is that God wanted to dwell in flesh in humankind in his family he wanted to portion himself out into his creation and now now brother Ben I'm standing here with part of the third pull the spoken word part and he's not he's not even manifesting creation like Jesus did when he was here by taking something that was made breaking it and more coming he said there was no there was nothing there to make a squirrel with but he spoke and it was the same as the creation in the beginning and he can say this because he knows he didn't do it like if he had any inkling that he did it there's no way he could stand before a crowd of people and say something like that but it wasn't him he said it's the same Jesus Christ it's the same Jehovah that said it there he's the same one that's Among Us he's doing it now but what was God the great mystery the great mystery that was God wanted to dwell with man God wanted to take on flesh he wanted to dwell upon the Earth and now he's doing and a redeemed Son of God Amen something that he did before the foundation of the world what a display that's been in our day what a display so now we come to uh questions and answers 1964 August of 1964 questions and answers and somebody said now this the third pool and is speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the Rapture in the Resurrection The Son of Man this is so or is it not and you would do this if properly pressed upon would you not escaping all these things Escape all these things and stand before the son of man Luke 21 36. so this is the question the question brother Benham is now that the third pool is speaking the word it seems entirely possible that you could speak the word and one another person would be completely fully restored placed entirely ready for the Rapture in the Resurrection The Son of Man he's saying now that this has been manifest you could speak somebody and they could be Rapture Ready fully complete the son of man here's brother Bam's answer now my dear friends see now I think here that you you got you got a good statement yes sir yes sir he's agreeing that blows me away now that would be so he says that's true you said brother brennaman other words here what I I don't think that's I believe not polishing up what you said but I believe I can make it a little clearer to the people you are believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here witnessed the squirrels and all those other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things in that do these things there I never asked him that he by his own Divine will came to me and said you go do this now remember let's go back to Mark 11 and 23 when he says if you say to this mountain I'm going to read it to you for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith now brother Branham when he creates those squirrels he says I I was wondering about this scripture this was the scripture on his mind and he couldn't solve it out he couldn't figure it out and he was curious about that scripture and while he was musing over that scripture God came to him and told him to speak and and whatever you say will come to pass and he says well you know I don't know what to say and he says what do you need and he says you're hunting I mean God Is So leading him along he didn't even know what to ask for he said he's he's not planning for this he's not looking for this he's not desperately praying to God he's not fasting and praying he's not trying to make something happen he's out in the woods musing over a scripture God comes to him at the appointed time and begins to speak to him and tell him what to say and if God comes you to that way it's not hard to have no doubt in your heart and believe that what you say will come to pass because there is nothing that he conjured up nothing of his own thinking it wasn't part of his faculties at all amen it was come from God and then God was going to use his faculties Amen to speak the word and then God was going to make it happen there's such a lesson here because brother Branham had no control over it he didn't ask for it he couldn't make it happen all he could do was keep trusting in The Lord of walking the Lord walking obedience to his word and whenever God wanted God would inject himself and begin to speak to him and he says those things were sovereignly given amen amen so whatever idea we have about manifestations of the third pool and spoken word and tightening up and all these things whatever idea we have about that we need to get out of our mind that it's going to come from us as in our idea our thinking our will if God showed it to us so we would see it identified clearly and then he would allow a prophet to explain how those things transpired then I think we should just stay in that pattern so much foolishness would be averted if man left himself out of things and quit trying to work something up and get and work something in and get all worked up and make something happen and believe that he's got the faith to pull something down and the faith to pull something up listen whatever we need God will give to us if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen you're not going to miss anything you're not going to miss out on anything if you've got confidence and who's called you you've got confidence in who you are if the seals of your life have been peeled back and you have a recognition Within You by faith that by by the grace of God that you came from God and you're going to God you don't have to worry about missing any manifestation or trying to prove anything by a manifestation amen praise God so sometimes people's ideas of the manifestation of the third pole and spoken word frighten me because you can see it's just something they want to do and it's almost like used in Vengeance you know when when they tighten up and come against us we'll say I don't think that's the right nature I don't think that's what God's looking for in the in the message thy house my brother Ben preached in 1961. it says as I said the other day when we're born of the spirit of God God isn't weak in one place and strong in another if you've got a little shadow of God and you're just a little speck of God then you got all power you got enough power in you to make a world and go out and live in it we spoke of this on Sunday but of course that power is controlled by faith if it wasn't we'd all have us a world out there living in it but if you're a Son of God or a daughter of God you've got the power of God in you amen so then that law holds that Faith to a certain thing so listen you've got the power in you now to do it so go do it it's in you now do you believe this in you now if you believe it's in you now show it to me oh you see the trick of the devil he tried that with Jesus and Jesus never took the bait if thou be the Son of God if thou be the Son of God and all he did was answer back with the word and he never took the bait because he didn't have anything to prove amen and the best thing to do is be insecure in who God made you and don't have anything to prove because it'll push us into fanaticism the very minute we have to have a manifestation to prove who we are or we want to show somebody something or or we want something tacked to our name as a Vindication of our ministry or or that we're a bride or or we're more bride than this one's bride the very minute you go down that you're going to fall into a trap amen because that's not how it works because the minute the gifts are used and the minute anything else is used for self then it's wrong remember Jesus only did that which the father showed him he didn't do it on his own amen it wasn't his own idea it was in his own desire remember when he walked by the pool of this Bethesda he had to tip to around Waterhead babies men women carrying water at babies and step over cripples and lame and move his way through the crowd to go to the one that the father had showed him in vision and do you think Jesus didn't have compassion and want to heal them all amen when Jesus saw the multitude amen that were fainting because of hunger that come out to preach him he had compassion upon all of them and they were just hungry not sick and lame and crippled but brother I said true compassion is to do the will of God so although Jesus was God in flesh amen although he had all power although what he said would come to pass he only did that which the father showed him amen and so brother Branham said he was led by vision and so now we want to be like Jesus amen but then you can't take your own desire you can't protect yourself defend yourself prove yourself because Jesus never did I think to me this is just a side note but I think this is why gifts are so dangerous I'm thoroughly convinced gifts are dangerous and the more gifts you have the more dangerous it is because gifts and callings with God are without repentance so that gift will operate because the gifts and calling of God without repentance but it will operate in your life even if you're going wrong that gift may still operate in your life I think gifts are extremely dangerous because gifted people can find security in an operation of a gift because when I do this God answers because when I preach people are saved because when I lay hands on them they're healed therefore I'm okay gifts and callings are without repentance I think gifts are extremely dangerous I think if you have a gift and you're a gifted person you better humble yourself and beg God to keep you because you don't have the power to keep yourself and the devil is after you to push you just a little too far and a gifted person with an insecurity is dangerous it's a weapon in the hand of the devil and listen we all have insecurities raise your hand if you're secure then when everybody stares at you and laughs you'll start feeling insecure so that's a side note coming back in the message countdown from 1964. the promise says now natural astronaut a natural astronaut has something to control him when the astronaut is in the air he has something backwards here back down here on the earth that controls him it's called radar that radar moves him around shows him where he's at tells what he's doing and that radar controls him from a radar Tower here on Earth that's the natural astronaut so the spiritual astronaut has a controlled power has a control tower too it's not down here like a man is it's up there and it's the Holy Ghost that's in him that's controlling him a tower of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's under control keeps him in control by the word I can't emphasize this enough he keeps in control by the word not in a bunch of fanaticism some whooped up some up up nonsense but thus saith the Lord and it happens it's always under control amen this is what I want out of my life I want to be one of those spiritual astronauts amen that is under the control of the Tower of the Holy Ghost um and it's under control and keeps him in control by the word listen there's so much that can happen and so much spiritual things can happen but and some of it good maybe not good but keep me in this word because the Holy Ghost will keep him under control and keeps him in control by the word I'm going to read this again not in a bunch of fanaticism some whooped up nonsense but thus saith the Lord and his word is the state the Lord and it happens it's always under control he's got a control tower that's the Holy Ghost and the word is his program and he lays right into that program and the power of the Holy Ghost endows him to move out and it brings the achievement that God wants by that God wants to achieve for his people that it might fulfill what he promised who's achieving and whose achievement is it so this spiritual astronaut that's controlled by the Tower of the Holy Ghost that's can keep him and him in control by the word amen it's moving the Holy Ghost endows him to move out and brings the achievement that God wants to be achieved for his people that it might fulfill what he promised so who's bringing the achievement gone whose achievement is it God's the spiritual astronaut is just the tool that's in his hand amen now I want to get to the part where I really wanted to get to the character for the third pool in the church age book out of the Smyrna Church age brother Ram is going to read a scripture he says why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8 17 and 18 and he quotes this scripture if and if children then heirs Heirs of God and joint is with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation so why must we suffer isn't since you received the baptism the Holy Ghost you received a revelation under the seals of who you really are have you had any suffering trials tribulations disappointments heartaches even some of your own failures failures from other people setbacks stumblings I've had them all everything I've listed I've had but why because God must develop within us christ-like character because a man without character can't Reign but we've been called To Rule and reign a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic this goes back to gifts gifts and callings are without repentance how many have seen gifts used in a satanic way but Power with character is fit to rule Hebrews 5 let's turn to Hebrews together I'm going to read a couple scriptures out of there Hebrews chapter 5. Hebrews chapter 5 we'll read verse 8 and 9. though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation and to all them that obey him it's amazing to me that Jesus laid down a pattern for us and and Paul here in the book of Hebrews picks that up and says don't worry son learn The Obedience by the things which he suffered that's the same way we learn obedience God lets us stub our toe bump our nose take a few hard Falls and we learn to obey the word we get off the word and he lets us suffer the consequences of our actions and he's training us to stay with the word so Jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation into all them that obey him so now let's go over to to chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 12 verse 4 ye have not yet resisted under blood striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all our partakers didn't are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much more much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet not even for his own pleasure but for our benefit he corrects us but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chest chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby amen God as a father is bringing us up right God as a father knows when to chase it and when to Scourge he knows when we go wrong and he knows how to bring the rod of Correction to bring us back right but he's not doing it even for his own pleasure he's doing it for our Prophets he's doing it because he has a plan for us and we have to be kept in a certain kind of character for the benefits and blessings of this plan so he's doing it for us and no chastisement for the present seemeth to be joyous I've never had any that I liked right but Grievous they're not joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the priesable fruits of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby there's something that we're learning There's Something That We're gaining and that something will forever be grateful for we've had our scorchings we've had our chastenings and we probably have more coming but it's always intended for a purpose because power without character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and we are being we are being trained to rule this is our education this life is our education this is not our destination this is training us for our destination this is a training ground where we must learn where we must gain character because character is not a gift character is a victory so God could not birth us give us character and bring us into uh the kingdom no we have to pass through this life to gain the character necessary to rule and reign so I wanted to just take a look at a couple patterns here so we see patterns in the scriptures and we see things even in the first Exodus and if we look at the first Exodus we'll see Moses was actually an example his life became an example to the Israelites we all believe that many times the prophet's life becomes an example becomes a testimony of what God's doing it becomes the word to the people so so Moses here his life his very life and the pattern of his life is testifying or even foreshadowing what will happen to Israel and if we just think about his life for a minute he's he's born in Egypt and and he's born a proper child so he's born under a sign he's predestinated to be the deliverer and there's a prophecy of Deliverance that is waiting for this deliverer and and 400 years the prophecy says I'll bring your children out he's talking to Abraham out with a mighty ham and so now the time comes Abraham or Moses will pick this up in Exodus chapter two let's go to Exodus 2. and look at this scripture Exodus chapter 2. in verse 11. and it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown then he went out to his Brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied on an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way in that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand and when he went out the second day behold two men of the Hebrew strove together and he said to to him that did the wrong wherefore smionest thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendeth thou to kill me as thou kills the Egyptian and Moses feared and said surely this thing is known and when Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay Moses but Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian and he sat down by a well so here here in the time of the prophecy to be fulfilled comes the right man and and he's the one that was born a proper child and he comes to fulfill the prophecy and and when he begins he starts off to move in Deliverance and he kills an Egyptian so there's an Egyptian that's dead then after the Egyptians dead he meets a challenge and in that challenge he runs away scared and in his fright he runs to the Wilderness and he spends 40 years wandering in the wilderness following after his father-in-law sheep we all together is that the pattern so now when God finally gets him trained and gets him in condition and gets him right and able to perform the word the promise that's in his life he brings him back into Egypt and when he brings him back into Egypt he delivers from a mighty hand amen and in in Egypt is decimated Egypt is destroyed and then in the crossing of the Red Sea when God closes the sea upon the army of Pharaoh Pharaoh and his army is destroyed so where Moses had one dead Egyptian now the Israelites have dead Egyptians but then they come to Katie's barnia and when they come to Katie's barnia they meet a challenge and in the face of the challenge they're afraid Moses in the face of the challenge was afraid and because of their fear they backed down from the word of God and then have to wonder in the wilderness for 40 years just like Moses did following the Sheep amen so we see the patterns and what was God doing in the 40 years with Moses is in the wilderness brother Benham said ah brother Ben said in voice of the sign he said this Exodus to be brought from Egypt back to their Homeland where they were promised to come was just at hand and God had to re-educate his man remember Moses was educated for 40 years getting all of his doctor's degrees and everything and had taken God just another 40 years to take out of him what education had put in him 40 years in the wilderness that taking it take it out it what was put in so now when when he flees in the face of the obstacle and backs down from the promised word and runs through the Wilderness he becomes a Wanderer in the desert for 40 years but what's God doing God is re-educating his man he's knocking all of Egyptian education out of him and we know that God helped him along and gave him a hot tempered wife to even help improve his character and now he who was going to rule everything is subject to his father-in-law working for his father-in-law God is re-educating his man so now when Israel comes out with a mighty hand and has their dead Egyptians amen and they come to Katie's barnia and they flee from the promised word because they're afraid now they have to wonder in the wilderness for 40 years what's God doing he's knocking all of the wrong understanding that came from Egypt out of the nation so Moses's life becomes a pattern for Israel are we together do we agree don't raise your hand if you disagree or hurt my feelings just talk to me later I hope we all agree and the reason I went through that is because I want to show you the prophet of God's life in this day becomes a pattern for us God Amen God begins to work in his life and commissions and he begins to preach the gospel amen then when he's baptizing on the Ohio River in 1933 a pillar of fire comes down amen and a great statement is made amen that just as John the Baptist for when his first coming amen you'll have a message that will forerun a second coming of Christ and so now he's got this prophecy in his life amen and we know after that that he runs up to to Mishawaka Indiana I mean he's going up fishing and he comes across the Revival and there you know he preaches we know the story he gets several invites and he comes back and when he meets the challenge of his mother-in-law his mother-in-law tells him don't go out with that bunch of trash and don't do this and he fears his mother-in-law to make her angry any any and he stops moving forward in the program of God listen he says in my life story now from here listen I listen to my mother-in-law instead of God and forsaken the church and went on back with the Baptist people right away plagues hit my home listen he's the one the pillar of fire came over and the words were spoken that prophecy is not going to change you believe that but there are some lessons this Prophet has to learn he needs the character to move into that office and he needs listen he learned a valuable lesson because when he when he disobeyed God and he listened to his mother-in-law he said that's when plagues hit my home he said that's when he said that's when my father died that's when my brother died he said then a flood came and God took my baby and then when my wife died listen that Prophet went through chastisement he had a good father because there was going to become a great power into the hand of that Prophet The King's sword was going to drop into his hand and before that happened he had to have the character to handle that word and because he had to have the character God would even let him make this mistake because even our mistakes work together for God's glory and he can make our mistakes even work together in his plan and so now the prophet has to he has to fail and he has to take chastisement and what I would say is hard chastisement so much so that it gives me pity it makes me feel sorry for him amen except I Know What It produced God wasn't taking pity on them because God knew what it would produce God had to chasten his son because he had to bring him into this position and so now he moves on then he moves into the ministry he gets a commission from an angel he meets an angel in a cabin and the angel begins to tell him that yeah that you're born for a specific purpose you've got a Ministry of healing to take to the peoples of the world and now he goes out with a commission and when he goes out with the commission he goes with the first pull and in the first pull if he takes somebody by the hand amen there'll be a pattern break out on his arms as that pattern breaks out he'll be able to discern the sickness and then when he prays for them if he can get the people to believe him nothing will stand before his prayers not even cancer but then brother Branham says he made a mistake with the first pull he pulled too hard and he tells us I won't go and read all the quotes but we know the story as well he he he pulls too hard and at one time I think it was Jonesboro Arkansas he stayed at the pulpit for eight straight days praying for the people why because he had compassion and he had a gift and he had a commission and he stayed there praying for the people and eventually his schedule broke him down to the point where he said he had a nervous break and he said it almost killed me and I left the field for eight months and he said that was wrong I learned wisdom what was he doing he was working in a commission that an angel gave him but he had to learn how to work in that Commission there's things he had to learn and he suffered along the way then when it came to the second pool he comes to a place I'll see if I can find the quote here in the second pool he says in the message experiences 1952 he says now he told me that this sign would be given first and if they would believe that that you you would know the very thoughts of their heart and by that they would believe that's the same God and God knows that I know nothing about it then the same Pillar of Fire that spoke to Moses has spoken again in the last day and it was not Moses that done anything it was the angel that went before Moses that did it you catch that Moses didn't do anything the Angels the Lord that went before Moses he did it all Moses could get to the end of his life and say I was only standing near when he did those things do you remember what Moses got chasing for and that chastisement of the Lord would not let him enter into the Promised Land because when God told him to go speak to the rock that it gives forth water he went took his rod in his hand and he was angry at the people because they were chiding with him about water and he says listen to statement must I fetch water for ye stiff-necked people and he struck the Rock and water came out God still honored his gift and still God honored his position and his calling as the prophet and honored that rod in his hand and when he struck it water still came out but what did he do he glorified himself instead of God he was supposed to speak to the Rock in the name of God and the water was supposed to spurt out but in his anger he elevated himself and said must I fetch water and as soon as he put himself in that position God smote him and said you'll not enter into the Promised Land it's very important to remember who's God and Who We Are by the prophet of God could come in his ministry say I wasn't the one who was down on the river that day I'm not the one who done those things I'm not the one who opened the blind eyes I was only standing there when he did it and then when he would speak squirrels into existence twice he would say See Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he can create where there's nothing listen this is the kind of character this bride has got to get to if she ever hopes to have a manifestation not not one that'll say I'll say and I'll do this and devil you get back my goodness that's not the way the prophet operated so much of that rhetoric is elevating self and this bride has got to get to the place where she doesn't do anything it's the angel of the Lord who did it all it was the pillar of fire that's Among Us it was Jesus Christ it was not me I was just standing near when he did it and you could say to your brother but I heard the words come out of your mouth and you say you know what that wasn't even my thinking God just placed it there had nothing to do with me this is the place we've got to come to it says now surely people we can understand I'm still in the second pool now Moses here's one thing that I do wrong I'm admitting it with the Bible before me I'm doing wrong by bringing this person up here and speaking to them till I have to break myself into a vision that weakens me down what I ought to do well maybe I ought to have them call one person out of the audience or something another like that and bring them up here and talk to them and line up a prayer line and pray for all the rest of them as they went by that would be better but it's got to a place where if you don't stand and talk to the person the vision doesn't come they don't even think you're anointed I brought that upon myself I confess before God brother Benham on the second pool pulled too hard with a sign in the hand pulled too hard amen with with the discernment he pulled too hard and that's what he was told in the vision amen he pulled too hard amen and he said don't do it on the third one foreign so what's happening Brother Branham is learning remember in the vision the second pool he pulled too hard and he got the line all tangled around his feet and he was trying to put together and he said forgive me I'm a stupid person forgive me remember that he realized he had failed amen he should have just shown the sign of discernment and then turned the people to the word and had him take their healing based off the word the discernment would show that the same God that was there was the same God here it's the sign of the Messiah now take him out his word but he didn't do that he kept pulling with the second pull more discernment more to sermon until the people wouldn't even believe what he was saying unless they saw the discernment and they wouldn't even accept their healing unless he had a vision of them so he pulled too hard but on the third pool he wasn't to do that so what's he doing he's learning what do we get to watch in the prophet's life we get to watch the child training of a Son of God who's coming to his adopted position we are such a blessed people we get to see the successes and the failures we get to see the mistakes and we get to see his chastisement remember the tax case he had to go through and the tax case was a big deal to him and when the lawyers called and he was so tired and he said something wrong and then the angel of the Lord told him it was a lie but he himself amen didn't realize and we would have even forgiven him right he stepped outside and told his wife tell him I stepped outside well technically he was outside I'd give him a pass God gave him no pass because he was training a son of God he was training him to be honest he was training him to to be a man to do things right he was training him right then when he comes up to the third pool through the second pool then he has to begin to deal with rejection and in 1962 he says in the present stage of my Ministry said how I think of that how a servant that'll stand true to the word sooner or later just remember the people are going to forsake Him now we want to strike that just for a few minutes and I won't keep you too long because I want you here in the morning always when God's servant stands true to the word all forsake Him now just take anywhere you want to any time in the Bible or in history that when a man stayed true no matter how popular who he was when he stayed true to the word the time come when the religious World forsaken him and cut him off now just read it if you take the Bible from Genesis over to the Book of Revelation and pick up in the pre-19 council and take down to the 19 fathers and every man every saint every Prophet every true servant of God stayed with the word was forsaken by the ecclesiastical thing and cast down now what is he saying he's showing that this rejection has to come and he starts to go back to the scripture where Paul says all forsaken me demons loving this present world has forsaken me and brother bam is typing into his ministry he's coming to the third pool and at the opening of the seals he said now that'll cost ten thousand of my friends to leave me what's God doing God is training God is training a son of God he's learning to stay with the word regardless of the consequences stick with the word regardless of what's going to happen amen and he was training him and he was training him because what he had and what he had to give and the gift that was in his life and the word that was going to be placed in his hand was a power amen that if he did not have character would become satanic with that kind of gift in his life if the devil would have got in to influence I'm telling you amen it would have went haywire the whole world would have went haywire but God had to train him and just as Moses life was a pattern for Israel that prophet's life is a pattern for us God has called us and commissioned us he's told us who we are and what we're to do but along the way we've got a lot of lessons to learn amen and when brother Branham would grow and learn a lesson then he would move into the first pool after his chastisement after his refusal to go after all of that then an angel would come commission him then he would move into the ministry then in the first pool he would make a mistake and and then he would have to leave the field for eight months but but then he would learn a lesson then God would open up the second pool listen brother Branham did not have a pillar of fire give him a declaration of his ministry at the river and then him manifest the third pool there was a lifetime of growing and chastisement and learning and character building and obedience before he come into the third full minister and you think this bride is just going to be endowed with the spoken word without character without child training without chastisement without bumping her nose a few times falling stumbling failing getting corrected listen think about the the way the Revelation has been growing and our lives have been changing for us for me individually it's been step by step by step by step by step amen you don't you don't just wake up a newborn babe in Jesus Christ and God gives you the power of the spoken word my goodness what would we have done with it what would I have done with it years ago I'm ashamed to say I would have been selfish I would have been prideful I would have been air it made me arrogant I would have brought me into an absolute destruction of myself and the people around me and if you can't say Amen to that then maybe you've deceived yourself because we're all growing we're not what we're not what we were and we're not what we ought to be but praise God we're not what we were I'm not what I want to be amen I'm not what I ought to be but the one who's brought me from what I used to be the what I am now is the same one the same father who's training me Amen to move in that position where he can entrust me with whatever he needs to entrust me with to manifest his glory and for his achievement but I don't believe it's going to come until the time that we're dead to self look at the end of brother Brennan's Ministry and all that he went through the death of his wife the death of his daughter the death of uh of his father the death of his brother amen the the the the the absolute roaring success of the first part of his ministry in the accolades and the newspapers full and the love from all the world and then moving to the second poem people start slowly pulling back until finally his friends start pulling away from him and through it all he fails in the tax case and he and he fails in the second pool and he fails in this and he keeps getting corrected and chasing of the Lord and then afterwards I mean even after the opening of the seals he comes to standing in the Gap and gets corrected from the Lord for his for his selfishness for his hurt feelings and wanting to go uh move away from the people what God's doing he's bringing him into position what's God been doing with us bringing us into position in the message things that are to be by the way I said and how am I going to teach them algebra when they won't learn their ABCs when they won't even do the common thing see the natural thing how you're going to tell them high things when you won't even start you want to get on top the ladder before you hit the first that's the reason you fall if you want to say why do I keep failing uh let's come back to this quote trying to get on the top of the ladder before you hit the first that's the reason you fall you get at the bottom and climb right on up as God leads you cope your life and every ever follow every bit of the word that God has ordained for you to do then the message the true Easter seal he says that's what's the matter you're trying to jump on top of the ladder when you ought to be on the bottom yet see get started down here clean up get started right then we would we we could build upon that otherwise you cannot build because any foundation that's not built upon the principles of Christ will fall and and the Zachariah tells the rubable don't despise the day of small things because you will see the plummet in the hand is a rubber born zeruble who laid the foundation will call for The Headstone amen just because it starts off small amen don't despise the small things in our lives amen because that's what works to build the great things in the message the seed is not air with the shock he says now that's how the church starts that's how it always starts you start from the bottom you don't start from the top a man trying to climb a ladder tries to get on top first he'll break his neck you've got to start and build up to that praise God Moses tells him the word of God in Exodus this is what he says in chapter 23. verse 29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate in the Beast of the field multiply against it by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land brother Brandon from the beginning was ordained to be the seventh angel and the voice amen the voice of Revelation 10 7. but God brought him little by little trained him taught him brought him into a position he didn't commission him then give him the revelation of the seals and the power of the spoken word I hope this makes sense to you let it be a pattern for us let's let's look at First Peter together first Peter chapter 5. First Peter chapter 5 verse 10. but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthen settle you when after you've suffered a while not day one not when you first start on this journey sometimes we get so disappointed at our failures and our chastisement but that is what we're learning from that's the training that we're in and that's why we're in this life that's why we've come into this condition that's why we're born in this flesh that's why we're journeying through this life is because we must gain character for reigning and there's certain achievements God wants to make in his bride and he cannot make those achievements if that bride is going to stand before the people and say shall I fetch water for you stiff-necked people no sir he's got to come to the character where it's never her it's always him and she knows within herself she can do nothing but with him all things are possible that he is the Vine I am the branch if I'm disconnected from the breath there's nothing if you see fruit on me it's the life from the vine it's not the branch I'm just the place that comes out I'm not the producer of it it's the life and the root of the vine that's bringing the fruit I'm not producing the fruit I'm just the one that's hanging on there has to be an entire attitude shift till we can be as humble as that Prophet was humble with as much power and manifestation as he had in his life he was completely humble hey brother brother random never would have found himself worthy to speak to a storm he would have never thought he was Worthy but God come and told him to do it and he had confidence in that voice and he knew whatever it told him was the truth and so he knew without a doubt that if he did what the voice said it would happen it would happen before he spoke it before I mean he believed it before he spoke it that it would be and that was the Fulfillment of Mark that we read if you say unto this mountain you know and brother Branham was given amen that kind of authority to speak amen and he was representing Jesus Christ on Earth he was Jesus Christ was living in that flesh and he was a representation of Christ in the formation of the bride and he was speaking and he had that manifestation in that power and he spoke and the storm did exactly what he said but you know he never said anything to a mountain to move because God never told him that he didn't wasn't given sovereignly that even though that was in the scripture he couldn't say because of this now I can do that he couldn't do that until God told him to do that this is a man who came under control this was a spiritual astronaut that was controlled by a tower and he became an example to you and I this is how it works this is how it works these things as the lessons came and as he grew and as he matured more was given sign in the hand lessons mistakes chastening learning second pull discernment mistakes lessening chastising it lessons chastisement rejection third pool comes sometimes we want to say we're bride and we want to jump to the top of the ladder I say God help me learn what I need to learn today keep me humble Lord and help me learn what I need to learn today we've heard talking about the spoken word the manifestation I think brother Benham declared it for us and he showed us temporarily what we'll see in fullness of power what it will look like I don't know how it will happen I don't know will it be everybody will it be a few well I have no idea uh it may be completely different than what I'm even thinking but the point is it'll be there according to the prophecy and it'll be according to God's design and will and his timing through whomsoever he chooses but the vessel he chooses will have the character to handle that power he will see to it so if we ever want to be part of that manifestation then what do we do today I say never forget your ABCs never forget your ABCs we have people who want to show Dynamic gifts and dynamic powers and they want to speak things and they want to do great things and really when it comes down to it they want to be somebody you can see through it but but they want to speak things but I say if you want to speak something into existence and if you want the power of the spoken word then start by speaking the word to this earth here and getting this to obey the word well I speak to a storm if you can't even keep from lying why speak to a storm if you can't even keep your home in order why speak to a storm if you can't keep this body this Earth why speak to the Earth if you can't speak to this earth and make it match the scriptures crazy man if you can't conduct yourself in your home as a Son of God and a daughter of God if you're fighting and fussing all the time if the children are disorderly then why why even think about speaking something into existence until we first come back to the ABCs and let God train us where we're at and repent and recognize I need something more I need a greater character just to handle today amen we want to speak a world to existence and go live a private life on it but we can't pay our tithes on a regular basis or show up to church according to the word and forsake the assembling together of ourselves you realize that no matter how far you go in math you still need ABCs to go to algebra and trigonometry and all that and no matter how advanced you get in literature all literature is still made of the ABCs at least English literature you can never get away from the ABCs you can never become so advanced in the kingdom of God that you don't need to pay your tithes pray and read your Bible every day that you don't need to come to Fellowship you're never getting so Advanced that you don't need fellowship with the Believers you never got so Advanced that you don't need to sit under the live preaching of the word through the faithful Ministry you've never you've never got that advanced yet we can never we can never listen these things are foundational they're ABC's their basics in the scripture they're basic the rudimental parts of Christian Life through the foundation but remember the rest of the house is built on the foundation so you can never start building off the foundation and leave the foundation your building will collapse everything must stay upon this Foundation all the way up so we want to go high but forsake the foundation don't forsake the foundation we want to we want Power the bride's going to this and the bride's going to do that why doesn't the bride just keep her home in order well the bride will do this and the bride will do that why won't the bride just clean up her language clean up her lifestyle why won't the bride just as a husband loved his wife as Christ loved the church well I want the wife reverence her husband see what I'm saying if we ever want to get to the top of the ladder we've got to hit every rung on the ladder why to build character to learn obedience stay in line with the word we're never going to have power spoken word if we can't keep the word does that make sense we must have the character for the third pool we all want something Dynamic to happen and I do too I love when God does those things they move me when you hear what brother Benham said and you hear about the potential they move me I want to see it but I know that I need more character and I know that he needs to do a greater work in me and I can be so forward thinking and looking to the day when all this happens then I'm neglecting to live the right kind of Life today and it's the right kind of Life today that takes me there it's this rung of the ladder that I'm on that I must conquer to get a little higher so where are trials is where our failures are where we're struggling is the place that we should be focused on not what's going to happen in the future that's going to happen we're going to get there but God is taking you through something now to give you the character to handle wherever he takes us so let's learn our lessons let's build on the foundation and as we climb higher amen we're going to bump our nose we're going to fall we're going to scratch our knee we're going to make mistakes we're going to have heartaches but let's take our lumps and learn our lessons so that we can go to the next rung on the ladder and the next one and when the bride as a whole and all of us have moved up I mean I believe with all my heart we're going to see amazing things we've seen amazing things he's open to us amazing things I don't know what those amazing things are but I believe by the grace of God I have a father who's keeping building character in me even when I would have bypassed it I would have dodged it and moved around it but there's a father that's watching over me that's bringing me through everything he's chastening me and allowing things in my life and teaching me things by the things I've suffered so that he can establish me and settle me and get me into a place where he can achieve his achievement through me and it'll be him doing it for his glory and I will be the functionary we need to get to where we're just the tool in his hand and you can have a toolbox with ever so many tools but they lay there with nothing to do and no ability to operate themselves until the master Picks Them Up and puts them into use and we need to see ourselves as Tools in his toolbox that if I'm not in his hand and he's not the power behind my actions I can do nothing without him I can do nothing but with him all things are possible amen you know I want to close with just a little story you remember the story brother Benham tells of the slave buyer down south when he goes by the certain Plantation and there's a certain slave that stands out above them all he carries himself with dignity he doesn't have to be whipped to do his work he's just an outstanding slave and the slave buyer wants to buy him and the owner says he's not for sale and he says well what makes him so special do you treat him special no treat him like the rest of them Hey listen this world doesn't treat you special you get treated just like everybody else they get covered you get covered strep throat goes around the world gets strep throat the Believers get stripped that slave didn't get treated any different than all the other slaves does he get any better food to eat nope he eats in the galley with the rest of the slaves he gets the same treatment listen we get Now understand what I'm saying in this life we get the same treatment we're born we struggle we work we earn our living by the sweat of our brow we get sicknesses we eventually die but despite all the equal treatment he acted completely different he carried himself with dignity and when he asked what makes him so different he said well I've wondered that too but I found out that back in the Homeland his father is the king of the tribe and though away from home he conducts himself as the son of a king that's our goal in this life amen we may get treated the same we may suffer some of the same things when politics change and laws change we suffer like everybody else suffers when viruses sweep through they hit our body amen when old age Creeps in we get little creaks and pains and everything else that everybody else gets but we carry ourselves differently because we know where we came from and that we have a father and we can conduct ourselves in this slavery we can conduct ourselves as the Son and Daughter of a king and we can learn our lessons and we can grow and we can gain in character because power without character is satanic but but Power with character is and we've been predestinated to rule and reign with him for a thousand years we need to stop whining complaining crying and we need to just buckle down and say God teach me teach me mold me forgive me forgive me for my pride forgive me for my self-assertion into everything forgive me for trying to get Glory just forgive me Lord and help me to be a vessel that you can use Lord make me that dumb mute little tool and your toolbox that you use for your purpose when you choose to pick it up and how you choose to apply it I don't want to determine what you have to do how you have to do it how you have to use me but let me be that tool in your toolbox that whenever you have need you can pick it up and use it and I will just yield myself to your hand remember said I wasn't the one who come down on the river that day I wasn't the one what did he say I just surrendered myself how did it work he just surrendered himself it's not what he did it's what Christ did through him and it won't be what we did it's what Christ did through us amen let's all stand musicians if you'll come please it's powerheads and pray brother Derek if you want to go ahead and make your way around back with your parents let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord God that you've given us a vision in this hour that you wouldn't leave us with wrong expectations Lord but that we can look to your prophet and we can see the way you trained a son of God the way you brought him into position the way you brought him into maturity what you established him so that you could use him for some of the greatest works that have ever taken place on this Earth God we want that kind of character God we want the life that produced that to be in us we want to yield to your spirit and allow your spirit to teach us Lord for your Holy Ghost is our tutor Lord our great teacher to bring us Lord into your very likeness with your understanding so that we think like you and act like you and speak like you keep us in your word Lord help us to stay submissive and yielded to your hand forgive us Lord for our arrogance forgive us for being puffed up Lord and self-inflated and self-serving and self-seeking but help us to die more to self that you might live in us in a greater way bless your people bless us as we go our ways from here use us Lord For Your Glory may you have your way in each one of us God I believe that you still want to do Greater Works I believe it's part of your plan and I believe you want to do it with some of the people that are sitting here in this building but God we know in order to get there we have to be surrendered completely to you so that you can do the Greater Works through us Lord we surrender ourselves to you we commit ourselves afresh to you have your way in US finish the work Lord that you've left for this hour that you choose to do in and through the bride do it through US father we love you God we ask that you would keep this assembly Lord in our absence if you'd watch over the ministry that would go forth in this Pulpit may you encourage your bride teach us educate us Lord to the gifts may you bless your people Lord may watch over Brother Kyle and I as we travel give us Lord inspiration to minister according to your will and desire that at each place you'd give us the right word the right thought Lord and that you would Minister through our lips may we come back Lord with with wonderful testimony of what you've done to hear a wonderful testimony of what you've done here We Trust You Lord and we yield ourselves to you and we ask God that you would have your way in

is unto you and to your children and them that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call so if he's still calling then this promise is still available and we believe it for our brother Derek
