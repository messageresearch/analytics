[17:10] message wherever God will have Us carry
[17:12] it amen while we're standing let's read
[17:14] from John chapter 15 together and then
[17:16] we'll let you have your
[17:17] seats John chapter
[17:19] 15
[17:22] uh and verse 26 John 15 and
[17:27] 26 but when the a comforter is come who
[17:30] I will send unto you from the father
[17:32] even the spirit of Truth which
[17:34] proceedeth from the father he shall
[17:36] testify of me and you also shall shall
[17:39] bear witness because you have been with
[17:41] me from the beginning amen God bless you
[17:44] as you have your
[17:46] seats this is an interesting
[17:49] scripture and uh I'd like to look at it
[17:52] for just a moment oh thank you brother
[17:54] Ben praise the Lord You're my special
[17:57] friend today
[17:58] [Music]
[18:00] I'm sure I'll be needing that here
[18:02] shortly amen so
[18:05] uh so we look at this scripture and U I
[18:09] want to take for a subject if I could
[18:11] for a title this morning ordained to be
[18:14] a witness of the
[18:16] Resurrection ordained to be a witness of
[18:18] the Resurrection very simple thought
[18:19] we've shared on these thoughts before
[18:21] but looking here at at John
[18:26] 15 in verse 27 Jesus is speaking to his
[18:29] disciples and he's saying and ye also
[18:31] shall bear witness because you have been
[18:33] with me from the beginning that is
[18:36] interesting there's more than one way
[18:37] you can take that scripture and that's
[18:39] the way the scripture always is because
[18:41] it has a compound meaning and a compound
[18:43] Revelation you could say that God was
[18:45] speaking to them and saying you'll be a
[18:47] witness because you've been with me from
[18:48] the beginning of my Ministry because
[18:51] when was the beginning was it the
[18:52] beginning of his life or was it the
[18:54] beginning of his of his ministry or from
[18:57] adulthood and but but there's another
[18:58] way that you can look at this scripture
[19:00] and it's one that brother brandham gave
[19:01] us insight into because brother brandham
[19:03] said he told the disciples you were with
[19:05] me from the beginning but if you look
[19:06] through the gospels it's hard to find
[19:08] that exact quote unless you find it in
[19:10] this
[19:12] scripture and you also shall bear
[19:14] witness because you have been with me
[19:16] from the beginning what beginning when
[19:19] the logos came out of the father amen
[19:22] the attributes were there amen when God
[19:25] began to project himself when when
[19:27] Christ come forth amen we were there
[19:30] with him we have been with him from the
[19:32] beginning so it can mean both amen it
[19:35] could it could have multiple
[19:36] fulfillments but praise God God chose
[19:38] them he says because you were with me
[19:41] before
[19:42] Hallelujah and so because that they were
[19:45] from the with him from the beginning
[19:47] they were going to Bear witness of him
[19:51] let's go to Acts chapter
[19:57] one
[20:00] Acts chapter
[20:03] 1 and we'll look at verse
[20:10] 6 when they therefore were come together
[20:14] they asked of him saying Lord wil thou
[20:16] at this time restore again the kingdom
[20:17] to Israel and he said unto them it is
[20:20] not for you to know the times or the
[20:22] seasons which the father hath put in his
[20:24] power but you shall receive power after
[20:27] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[20:30] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[20:32] Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria
[20:35] and unto the uttermost part of the earth
[20:39] it's amazing here Jesus is also telling
[20:41] them this is after his resurrection he's
[20:43] he's meeting with them and he's
[20:45] beginning to tell them that now you'll
[20:47] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[20:50] is come upon you and you shall be
[20:52] Witnesses unto me he already told them
[20:54] that you'll bear witness of me he
[20:56] already told them that before his Cru
[20:58] crucifixion you'll bear witness of me
[20:59] because you were with me from the
[21:00] beginning amen but they needed something
[21:03] else to move them into that role of a
[21:05] witness amen and and if all they needed
[21:09] was just the knowledge of his Earthly
[21:11] Ministry because they already had that
[21:13] but you know Judas had that also amen
[21:16] there was other people who had a
[21:17] knowledge of his Earthly Ministry they
[21:19] needed more than just the knowledge of
[21:22] his ministry they needed more than just
[21:23] the record of his life amen to be this
[21:26] witness they needed a power that would
[21:27] move move them into the role of a
[21:29] witness and that power would be the
[21:31] power of the Holy Ghost because we know
[21:33] that the power of the Holy Ghost is the
[21:35] quickening power to bring the C Gene of
[21:38] God to bring the attribute of God to
[21:40] life so that part amen that part of them
[21:43] that was
[21:45] eternal you with me that part of them
[21:48] that was eternal was the part that was
[21:50] with him from the beginning the
[21:51] beginning of the beginning of the
[21:52] beginning that seed was there amen and
[21:55] it needed something more than just a
[21:57] record record of life it needed
[21:59] something more than just being an
[22:00] eyewitness it needed something more to
[22:03] awaken that part to make them a witness
[22:05] and it needed the quickening power to
[22:07] bring the seed to life and then you'll
[22:08] be Witnesses in in Judea and Jerusalem
[22:11] Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts
[22:14] of the world Amen praise God now let's
[22:18] look at verse
[22:21] 15 after Jesus spoke these things he was
[22:24] received up into a cloud and then they
[22:26] gather into the upper room and and in
[22:28] verse 15 it says and in those days Peter
[22:32] stood up in the midst of the disciples
[22:33] and said and the number of names
[22:35] together were about
[22:37] 120 men and Brethren this scripture must
[22:39] needs have been fulfilled which the Holy
[22:42] Ghost by the mouth of David spake before
[22:44] concerning Judas which was guide to them
[22:46] that took Jesus for he was numbered with
[22:49] us and had obtained part of this
[22:51] ministry now this man purchased a field
[22:54] with the reward of iniquity and falling
[22:55] headlong he burst the ther in the the
[22:58] midst and all his bowels gushed out and
[23:00] it was known unto all the Dwellers at
[23:02] Jerusalem in so much as that field is
[23:04] called in their proper
[23:08] tongue oh my goodness Alama which is to
[23:12] say the field of blood for it is written
[23:14] in the Book of Psalms let his habitation
[23:16] be desolate and let no man dwell therein
[23:19] and his bishoprick let another take
[23:21] therefore of these men which have
[23:23] accompanied with us all the time that
[23:25] the Lord Jesus went in and out Among Us
[23:27] be beginning from the baptism of John
[23:29] unto the same day that he was taken up
[23:31] from us must one be ordained to be a
[23:34] witness with us of his resurrection and
[23:37] they appointed two Joseph called barabus
[23:40] who was surnamed Justice and Matias and
[23:43] they prayed and said thou Lord which
[23:47] knowest the hearts of all men show
[23:49] whether these two whether of these two
[23:52] thou has chosen that he may take part of
[23:55] this ministry and apostleship from which
[23:57] Judas by transgression fell that he
[23:59] might go to his own place and they gave
[24:01] forth their lots and the lot fell upon
[24:04] mitias and he was numbered with the 11
[24:07] Apostles so we see this this while
[24:11] they're waiting while they're tearing in
[24:13] the in the gap between jesus'
[24:15] resurrection and the coming of the Holy
[24:16] Ghost they were in this Gap and they
[24:19] were making preparations and and they
[24:21] realized that Judas had fallen and had
[24:23] failed but they also saw in the
[24:25] scriptures where the scriptures say in
[24:28] Psalms it's actually Psalms 1098 that
[24:30] they're quoting says let his days be few
[24:32] and let another take his office here it
[24:35] says Bishop Rick but in the Old
[24:37] Testament it says office let another
[24:39] take his office so they saw in the
[24:40] scripture that there must be somebody
[24:43] for the one who fell away somebody must
[24:45] take his office so they saw in the
[24:47] scriptures so they said we've got some
[24:51] qualifications we need somebody who has
[24:54] been with us in the ministry from the
[24:56] time of baptism ISM until Jesus was
[24:59] taken up that would that would make you
[25:01] a good
[25:02] witness amen that would be the
[25:04] qualification so so they they wanted to
[25:07] find men who would meet this
[25:08] qualification so they they they proposed
[25:11] two they found one amen who was uh uh
[25:14] barabus and meias and they took these
[25:17] two men and they presented them before
[25:19] the Lord and they prayed and said uh
[25:21] Lord which knowest the hearts of all men
[25:24] whether these two thou has chosen that
[25:26] they may take part of this ministry so
[25:29] now this ministry that Jesus Christ amen
[25:32] had left for for the disciples they were
[25:34] saying somebody must take apart because
[25:36] we see this in the in the Psalms so God
[25:39] we're we're giving you two choices you
[25:41] have to pick between one of our two
[25:47] choices amen and so they cast the Lots
[25:51] amen so they had a they had what they
[25:53] thought would make him them qualified to
[25:56] be a witness because he said here let's
[25:58] let's read a little bit
[26:01] further uh verse
[26:05] 22 said beginning from the baptism of
[26:08] John so let's pick it up in 21 so we get
[26:10] the context wherefore of these men which
[26:11] have accompanied with us all the time
[26:13] that Lord Jesus went in and out Among Us
[26:15] beginning from the baptism of John unto
[26:17] the same day that he was taken up from
[26:19] us must one be ordained to be a witness
[26:22] with us of his resurrection so what are
[26:24] they looking for they're looking for a
[26:26] witness of his
[26:28] resurrection they need a witness with
[26:30] them of his resurrection and they are
[26:33] looking carnal they are looking Earthly
[26:35] they are looking natural and they're
[26:37] looking for somebody if they're going to
[26:38] be a witness of the Resurrection then we
[26:40] need somebody who meets a qualification
[26:42] the qualification is they must be with
[26:44] us from the time of John's baptism till
[26:46] he was taken up from us and be one among
[26:48] us so we found two that meet the
[26:49] qualifications we present them to God we
[26:51] cast lots the lot fell on Mias Mias is
[26:54] now the
[26:56] choice but here's what brother bandham
[26:59] says in a sign of this time he says look
[27:02] even the apostles after they tried to
[27:03] choose one because of Judas falling they
[27:06] cast lots and it fell on Mias that was
[27:08] the best that they could do with the
[27:10] keys to the kingdom and there is not a
[27:12] scripture wrote where he did
[27:14] anything but God chose
[27:17] Saul an ill-tempered little fellow but
[27:19] he had to throw him on his back one day
[27:22] and let him look up a while and he said
[27:24] I'll show him what great things he must
[27:25] suffer for me see the Church chose Maas
[27:29] but God chose Paul see that's the
[27:31] difference God always does his choosing
[27:33] his election God does that by election
[27:36] by his for
[27:38] knowledge hallelujah amen so they they
[27:42] they had uh uh they had the uh the right
[27:45] idea they had the right it wasn't like
[27:46] they were coming out from Left Field it
[27:48] wasn't like they were completely wrong
[27:50] they saw in the scriptures where this
[27:52] one that fell let his days be few and
[27:54] let another take his office so he say
[27:56] this must happen amen and they hadn't
[27:58] received the Holy Ghost yet that's to
[27:59] lead them so now they're taking their
[28:01] own understanding and trying to find
[28:03] qualifications with what makes one good
[28:06] to be a witness of his resurrection well
[28:08] it must be one that saw everything had
[28:10] an eyewitness that would be one and God
[28:13] never recognize their choice because God
[28:15] has a different set of qualifications
[28:17] all
[28:19] together amen the Apostle Paul says I
[28:22] came as one born out of season amen I
[28:24] wasn't even there on the day of
[28:25] Pentecost I wasn't even there when the
[28:27] Holy Ghost fell I wasn't even following
[28:28] the ministry I can't even tell you all
[28:31] the events as they happened like Peter
[28:32] can or like Andrew can or like John can
[28:35] or like all of them like Ma you know
[28:37] Matthew Mark and Luke and John they
[28:40] wrote the gospels Paul didn't write them
[28:42] because Paul wasn't there following him
[28:44] around no doubt he had some knowledge of
[28:45] what happened but he wasn't an
[28:47] eyewitness from the days of John the
[28:49] Baptist but the baptism all the way till
[28:51] he's taken up amen but God chose him
[28:54] anyways to take that office to take part
[28:57] of the Ministry to be a witness of his
[29:01] resurrection praise be to
[29:04] God so let's turn to Acts chapter
[29:13] n Acts chapter
[29:21] n it
[29:23] says and Saul yet breathing out
[29:25] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[29:27] Disciples of the Lord went into the high
[29:29] priest and desired of him letters to
[29:31] Damascus to the synagogues that if he
[29:34] found any of this way whether they were
[29:35] men or women he might bring them bound
[29:38] into Jerusalem and as he journeyed he
[29:40] came near Damascus and suddenly there
[29:42] shined around about him a light from
[29:44] heaven and he fell to the Earth and
[29:46] heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul
[29:49] why persecutest thou me and he said who
[29:52] art thou Lord and the Lord said I am
[29:54] Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard
[29:57] for thee to kick against the Pricks Paul
[30:00] amen now comes into an individual
[30:02] Encounter With Jesus Christ The Living
[30:05] Jesus Christ after his death burial and
[30:07] resurrection and he does not see a man
[30:10] all he sees is a light and that light
[30:12] puts his eyes out and knocks him to the
[30:14] ground amen so what did he see he saw a
[30:17] light who was it it was Jesus
[30:22] Christ said who art thou Lord I'm Jesus
[30:25] whom thou persecute verse
[30:27] and he trembling and astonished said
[30:29] Lord what wil thou have me to do and the
[30:32] Lord said unto him arise and go into the
[30:34] City and it shall be told thee what thou
[30:36] must do and the men which journeyed with
[30:39] him stood speechless hearing a voice but
[30:41] seeing no man and Saul arose from the
[30:43] earth and when his eyes were opened he
[30:45] saw no man but they led him by the hand
[30:48] and brought him into Damascus and he was
[30:50] three days without sight and neither did
[30:53] eat nor drink amen we've spoke about
[30:56] this I think a couple weeks ago we
[30:58] highlighted this verse 9 and said for 3
[31:02] days he laid there without sight and did
[31:05] not eat or
[31:07] drink and we we we were when we looked
[31:10] at that we started just thinking and
[31:12] trying to imagine the thoughts that
[31:14] would go through Saul's mind at that
[31:17] time amen he had just had an encounter
[31:21] with Jesus Christ in the form of the
[31:24] pillar of fire that he recognized to be
[31:26] the old Testament
[31:28] sign God in the burning bush God uh the
[31:32] pillar of fire leading them through the
[31:34] Exodus Journey he knew what that Pillar
[31:37] of Fire was that was none other than the
[31:39] angel of the Covenant that was God
[31:40] himself amen and now this Pillar of Fire
[31:43] who put out my eyes and knocked me to
[31:45] the ground and humbled me tells me that
[31:47] he's Jesus Christ whom I'm persecuting
[31:50] and I'm persecuting not a man he's
[31:53] already dead and gone he was persecuting
[31:55] a church a group of people amen and he
[31:59] says when you're touching them you're
[32:01] touching me when you're persecuting them
[32:02] you're persecuting me when you're
[32:04] rejecting them you're rejecting me and
[32:06] now all of a sudden his eyes are out
[32:08] he's laying there no food no drink for
[32:10] three days I can only imagine what the
[32:13] thoughts that are going through his mind
[32:14] he's thinking could I have been wrong
[32:16] how could I be so wrong what have I
[32:19] done how many were imprisoned yeah how
[32:23] many were hauled away how many families
[32:26] were broke up how many meetings yeah how
[32:30] many
[32:36] died all of a sudden his whole
[32:39] world was breaking
[32:42] apart with an encounter with the living
[32:45] Jesus Christ changed everything all his
[32:50] understanding all the scriptural
[32:51] knowledge all his education all his
[32:53] pride everything is shattered amen
[32:57] because he met
[33:01] Christ brother B says in the message
[33:04] Queen of the South he said doctors might
[33:05] be able to come and explain it out to
[33:07] you doctors of
[33:09] divinity this out this away and twist
[33:11] the scriptures around but if a man's
[33:14] ever come to the backside of the desert
[33:15] like Moses in this 40 years of training
[33:18] but five minutes in the presence of the
[33:21] burning bush he knowed more about God
[33:23] than they could have trained him in a
[33:24] million
[33:25] years they might explain all this away
[33:28] and that away but if you ever meet God
[33:30] you've had an experience amen right
[33:33] praise
[33:35] God brother bandam even says in the
[33:37] message persevering he says no man ought
[33:39] to preach the gospel until first he's
[33:41] met God on the sacred Sands where no man
[33:43] can take it away from
[33:45] him the devil can tread on those sacred
[33:48] devil can't tread on those sacred
[33:49] grounds you were there when it happened
[33:52] and you know that you're you know what
[33:53] you're talking about I care how many
[33:56] scientists this and how much that it
[33:58] doesn't matter amen once you've come en
[34:00] counter and come in contact and
[34:02] experience the Living God it doesn't
[34:04] matter what science says it doesn't
[34:06] matter what others say it doesn't matter
[34:08] what happens you were there you know you
[34:10] came in contact with something other
[34:12] than yourself and it was a power that
[34:14] changed you to be a witness of the
[34:16] resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what
[34:18] happened to Paul that's what happened to
[34:20] Moses Moses listen Moses had the
[34:22] teaching he had the education he had the
[34:24] understanding he knew the prophecy his
[34:27] mother nursed him and brother B said
[34:28] when she bounced him on his knee she
[34:30] would say you were born a proper child
[34:32] you were born under a sign he begins to
[34:34] say you're the Redeemer that's promised
[34:36] to come and now he's got all the
[34:38] intellectual training all the military
[34:40] training and he's got all the religious
[34:41] training because his mother taught him
[34:44] he knew the prophecies he knew the
[34:46] season he knew the 400 years from the
[34:48] time of Abram he knew it all amen but
[34:51] all of that never translated into the
[34:54] right kind of action he never had the
[34:56] power to be the witness of that word
[34:58] until he got to the backside of the
[35:00] desert and for 40 years God was beating
[35:02] out humbling amen taking out of Moses
[35:05] all the stuff he had to get out of Moses
[35:06] but even that wasn't enough
[35:09] yet amen even that he got him humbled he
[35:13] got him broken he gave him a hot
[35:15] tempered wife he had everything he
[35:16] needed Amen to get his character right
[35:19] amen but even that never moved him back
[35:22] in the power of God to be a witness to
[35:24] testify to manifest the word it took an
[35:27] encounter with the pillar of fire god in
[35:29] a burning bush he had to come in contact
[35:31] with a living God and that changed
[35:33] everything God used everything before
[35:36] what his mother said still counted the
[35:38] prophecy still counted all that he had
[35:40] learned still counted all the humility
[35:42] he gained and the character that he
[35:43] gained in the trust it still mattered
[35:45] but none of it in itself qualified him
[35:47] to be a witness of the word it was his
[35:49] encounter with the power of God and then
[35:53] he went with a message and then he
[35:55] defied pharaoh he defied everybody he
[35:58] stood in the face of the rejection of
[36:00] his own people amen all the comments all
[36:02] the criticism everything that happened
[36:04] listen he killed one Egyptian and at the
[36:06] threat of another slave of exposing that
[36:08] he runs scared Into the
[36:11] Wilderness but now after meeting God
[36:14] face to face he runs back for his
[36:16] commission he runs back he was ordained
[36:19] to hold that office and nobody else was
[36:21] ordained to hold that office but he had
[36:23] to have something more than what he had
[36:25] in the 80 years Amen to equip him and
[36:28] Empower him and now he would face down
[36:31] threats from Pharaoh threats from
[36:32] government he would face down even his
[36:35] rejection of his own
[36:39] countrymen I feel sorry for Moses
[36:41] sometimes he stand the the the he come
[36:44] to deliver these people from the task
[36:46] Masters amen so he's got to face the
[36:48] world and the taskmasters and all the
[36:50] Devils yeah right they hate him and they
[36:54] want to kill him and they' like to get
[36:55] rid of him and and he's got to face that
[36:57] down but then he also has to face the
[37:00] misunderstanding of his Brethren that he
[37:02] came to save and he came to deliver and
[37:04] now they're mad at him because it got
[37:06] worse and why did you come in trouble as
[37:07] it's better that you never came the poor
[37:09] guy was standing there he couldn't win
[37:11] this way and he couldn't win that way
[37:13] amen but he could stand there because he
[37:15] met the pillar of fire he could stand
[37:18] his ground and stand in his position not
[37:21] because he was strong not because he had
[37:22] power amen all that he had ever done had
[37:25] failed but an En counter with a burning
[37:27] bush changed him completely he still
[37:30] failed he still had mistakes he was
[37:32] still Moses but there did something in
[37:34] him that he could stand in the face of
[37:36] all opposition because he knew this is
[37:38] the word this is the time this is the
[37:40] truth and Now's the Time for it to be
[37:43] manifest the Apostle Paul went through
[37:45] the exact same thing amen he had Zeal
[37:48] but he had Zeal because he was
[37:50] benefiting from the Jews
[37:52] religion he prospered from the religion
[37:54] he was prospering in the education he
[37:56] was making Headway with the elders and
[37:59] with the high priest he had an audience
[38:00] with them he received letters he was
[38:02] moving up in status everything was fine
[38:05] for him and he was moving in that
[38:07] channel and his
[38:09] Zeal I believe was a genuine
[38:11] Zeal but the Zeal was also
[38:16] self-promoting it was
[38:18] convenient and I believe it was a
[38:20] genuine Zeal because you see he says
[38:22] just as much Zeal
[38:25] after but he he's humbled
[38:30] afterwards so he's zealous he's he's
[38:33] moving in the Jews religion he's
[38:35] benefiting from the religion he he he he
[38:38] he's got contacts he's got education
[38:41] he's got respect he's got it
[38:43] all but in a moment's time everything
[38:50] changes now when he meets God face to
[38:55] face when he comes in contact with the
[38:57] pillar of fire that he knew to be a
[39:00] manifestation of God and that
[39:03] manifestation of God says I'm Jesus whom
[39:06] you
[39:08] persecute in a moment's time his whole
[39:11] Paradigm
[39:13] changed am he realized he was wrong
[39:17] realized what he was doing was wrong all
[39:20] he had been taught was wrong I mean it
[39:22] didn't change the word it didn't change
[39:24] the prophecies it didn't even change his
[39:26] desire to be zealous for the word but
[39:29] what it did is brought him in contact
[39:31] with the word for his day am right amen
[39:35] Christ in his day and it changed his
[39:38] understanding and from there he no
[39:41] longer needed the church support or
[39:42] letters from an elder or to be well
[39:44] thought of or a good
[39:46] education from that point on he didn't
[39:49] need any of that and he would stand
[39:51] listen he would stand in the face of
[39:53] governments that were given him he would
[39:55] stand in the face of religious leaders
[39:57] who used to love him now hate him he
[39:59] would stand Amen in the in the
[40:00] synagogues where he was welcom and now
[40:02] he's rejected he would stand rejection
[40:04] from there rejection from the Civil
[40:06] Authority rejection from the religious
[40:08] Authority and then after he goes around
[40:11] in in his ministry he receives rejection
[40:13] from his Brethren the very ones that he
[40:15] brought the gospel to would turn around
[40:17] and reject him because false Brethren
[40:19] would move in with false Doctrine and he
[40:21] was and he was rejected from the top he
[40:24] was rejected from the side he was
[40:25] rejected from the back he was rejected
[40:27] all around but how could he stand
[40:29] because he met a living God he wasn't
[40:32] hung on nothing else but this is God's
[40:34] word God told me
[40:36] [Applause]
[40:37] himself amen and now he could stand
[40:40] there with everything else all the
[40:42] opposition and all the sometimes they
[40:44] loved him sometimes they hated him all
[40:46] the all all the Civic rigers where they
[40:48] were trying to kill him amen but
[40:50] sometimes they would listen to him in
[40:51] audience and they would give heed to him
[40:53] and the whole city would praise him
[40:55] sometimes they would Stone him into
[40:56] tried to kill him sometimes the whole
[40:58] city would gather together to chant his
[41:03] demise they would welcome him into a
[41:05] synagogue as a teacher after he started
[41:07] preaching Christ they would kick him out
[41:09] and go to civil liberties or Civil
[41:11] Authorities and try to have him
[41:13] killed and then they would take him out
[41:15] of the city and stone him for dead he
[41:17] would get up and dust himself off and
[41:19] he'd walk into the next city and preach
[41:23] Christ amen what did it he had an
[41:27] encounter with Jesus Christ because he
[41:29] was ordained to be a witness of his
[41:34] [Music]
[41:41] resurrection praise
[41:44] God that's
[41:46] why before you preach the gospel you
[41:50] must have an encounter with Christ you
[41:52] must be born again with the baptism of
[41:54] the Holy Ghost in no because you will
[41:57] face all the same
[41:59] opposition that Paul faced and Moses
[42:03] faced it takes something more than good
[42:06] training or a good church or support
[42:08] groups takes something more than that
[42:11] you're going to have to know that you
[42:12] know that you
[42:17] know not just for the
[42:19] preacher the day is getting darker and
[42:22] darker friends and opposition all around
[42:25] is mounting that's we're all going to
[42:27] have to have the same experience to make
[42:29] it all the way to the
[42:32] end let's go to uh again the next
[42:35] chapter n let's start reading again in
[42:38] verse
[42:44] 10 and there was a certain disciple at
[42:46] Damascus named ananas and to him said
[42:49] the Lord in a vision ananas and he said
[42:51] behold I'm here Lord and the Lord said
[42:54] unto him arise and go into the street
[42:56] which is called straight and inquire in
[42:57] the house of Judas for one called salt
[43:00] of Tarsus for behold he prayeth and has
[43:03] seen an A Vision a man named ananas
[43:06] coming in and putting his hands on him
[43:08] that he might receive his sight then
[43:10] ananas answered Lord I have heard by
[43:12] many of this man how much evil he ha
[43:14] done to the Saints at Jerusalem and here
[43:17] Heath Authority from the chief priest to
[43:19] bind all that call on thy name but the
[43:22] Lord said unto him go thy way for he is
[43:25] a chosen vessel unto
[43:29] me oh I know it looks bad I know he's
[43:31] doing all wrong I know he does
[43:34] ananas if I could just rephrase this
[43:36] without changing the Bible ananas I know
[43:39] he doesn't meet your qualifications for
[43:42] Ministry and an I I know it doesn't look
[43:46] like he should be the one who takes
[43:48] judas's office I know he shouldn't be
[43:50] the replacement Matias was there all
[43:52] along Matias looks good Maas is probably
[43:55] super nice to all the brother and treat
[43:56] him maybe shelter him and protected him
[43:58] and this man is is running them through
[44:00] the mill taking them to before the
[44:02] magistrates and having them arrested in
[44:04] stone and all this I know he doesn't
[44:06] meet your qualifications but he meets my
[44:08] qualifications from before the
[44:10] foundation of the world he was with me
[44:12] from the beginning and he's the one
[44:14] qualified to be the
[44:18] witness amen and it doesn't mean Mias
[44:20] wasn't there at the beginning E Mias
[44:22] received the baptism of Holy Ghost but
[44:24] he wasn't ordained to take that Bishop
[44:26] brick he wasn't ordained to take that
[44:27] office and that part of the ministry
[44:29] that was by God's election by for
[44:31] knowledge from before the foundation of
[44:33] the world he always knew that Saul would
[44:35] be Paul would be the one who fulfills
[44:37] that who takes that
[44:39] office so not taking anyway from Matias
[44:42] I believe he was a brother I like to
[44:43] shake his hand and tell him that I love
[44:45] him on the other side but he wasn't the
[44:47] one amen that was going to take that
[44:49] office that was ordained for
[44:53] Paul amen
[44:57] amen so he says he doesn't meet your
[45:02] qualifications he doesn't look like one
[45:04] that's
[45:05] worthy to take the Bishop Rick of him
[45:08] that
[45:09] fell I I I know it looks bad I I know
[45:14] but
[45:15] listen go on yeah just do what I tell
[45:18] you to
[45:20] do I know what I'm
[45:22] doing but the Lord said in him go thy
[45:25] way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[45:27] Bear my name before the Gentiles and the
[45:30] Kings and the children of
[45:32] Israel what is it to bear his name it's
[45:35] to be a
[45:38] witness verse 16 for I will show him how
[45:41] great things he must suffer for my
[45:44] name's sake and ananas went his way and
[45:47] entered into the house and putting his
[45:49] hands on him said brother Saul the Lord
[45:51] even Jesus that appeared unto thee in
[45:53] the way as thou comest Hast sent me that
[45:56] thou mightest receive thy sight and be
[45:58] filled with the Holy Ghost and
[45:59] immediately there fell from his eyes as
[46:01] it had been scales and he received his
[46:03] sight forth with and arose and was
[46:06] baptized I say thanks be to God amen
[46:11] amen God knew where his chosen vessel
[46:14] was and God knew who was going to fill
[46:16] that
[46:17] office God knew who he had ordained he
[46:19] knew he was El and he knew it was down
[46:21] inside not what was on the outside of
[46:23] Saul God knew what was on the inside of
[46:25] Saul
[46:26] and God knew how to bring it to life and
[46:29] it would take an encounter with
[46:31] himself an encounter a meeting with the
[46:33] pillar of fire with the Living Word it
[46:36] would make that encounter and that
[46:37] encounter amen would bring life to the
[46:40] ordained predestinated seat on the
[46:42] inside and so that he could fulfill that
[46:45] office let's hold your place right here
[46:48] in Acts chapter 9 let's turn to acts
[46:51] 23 just want to read two scriptures
[46:54] quickly
[46:56] in Acts
[47:01] 23 and
[47:07] 11 23 and 11 and the night following the
[47:11] Lord stood by him and said be of good
[47:13] cheer Paul for as thou has testified
[47:16] this word testify also means
[47:18] witness as thou testify of me in
[47:20] Jerusalem so must thou bear witness also
[47:23] at Rome Paul was called and ordained to
[47:27] be a witness turn over with me to 2
[47:30] Timothy 2 keeping your hand in Acts
[47:33] 9 second
[47:40] Timothy 2 Timothy Chapter 2 and verse
[47:45] 8 remember that Jesus Christ of the seed
[47:48] of David was raised from the dead
[47:51] according to my
[47:52] gospel what's he doing he's a witness
[47:56] of the resurrection of Jesus
[47:58] Christ is that what he's doing am
[48:01] according to his gospel he's going
[48:02] around testifying to the Gentiles that
[48:04] Jesus Christ resurrected from the dead
[48:08] what were the disciples looking for they
[48:09] were looking for one qualified to be a
[48:11] witness of this
[48:14] Resurrection they thought in order to
[48:16] witness the resurrection you had to see
[48:18] the ministry in order to witness the
[48:20] resurrection you had to be there you had
[48:21] to hear his voice you had to follow the
[48:22] ministry you had to be there amen when
[48:25] you saw the crucifixion you had to know
[48:27] when he was arrested you had to know the
[48:29] circumstances about I mean the stone
[48:31] that was rolled and the seal that was
[48:32] placed and you needed to have firsthand
[48:34] knowledge of all of those things to be a
[48:36] witness and you had to see him after he
[48:38] resurrected and you had to see him in
[48:40] his Corporal body that resurrected you
[48:42] had to be there during the private
[48:44] conversations when he met his disciples
[48:46] amen and all of a sudden God bypassed
[48:48] all of that to be a witness of the
[48:50] Resurrection you don't need to see with
[48:51] fleshly eyes you don't have to have
[48:53] natural experience and Earthly
[48:55] experience to be a witness amen you have
[48:57] to have an encounter with the Living
[48:59] Word With Jesus Christ to awaken that
[49:01] Eternal part in you that was with him
[49:03] from the beginning to stand in your day
[49:05] to witness of Jesus Christ to witness of
[49:10] the Resurrection Paul was a witness of
[49:12] the resurrection of Jesus Christ because
[49:13] he met Jesus Christ but he didn't meet
[49:16] them the same way that the disciples met
[49:18] him in the resurrection amen he met him
[49:21] amen when he went back into the pillar
[49:23] of fire form that form that was now in
[49:25] the church church amen cuz he says why
[49:27] persecutest thou me that Pillar of Fire
[49:30] was in the body of Believers and that's
[49:32] how Paul met him he didn't meet any
[49:34] other their qualifications but he sure
[49:36] met God's qualification and if that was
[49:38] God's qualification to be a witness of
[49:40] the Resurrection then I stand here as a
[49:42] witness of the Resurrection cuz I've met
[49:45] the same qualification by the grace of
[49:47] God cuz I believe by faith that I was
[49:49] with him before the foundation of the
[49:50] world and he ordained me to come forth
[49:52] in this day and I was going every which
[49:55] way but the right way but in some time
[49:57] he came to me and I met the pillar of
[49:59] fire the same one that that was here
[50:02] with the word the same one that had his
[50:03] picture taken over brother bam said the
[50:05] same one that brought the word is still
[50:08] here delivering the word and I come in
[50:10] contact with a living breathing Jesus
[50:14] Christ making me qualified to be a
[50:18] witness of his
[50:19] resurrection amen that's what makes me a
[50:22] witness of this message not because I
[50:23] was in the prayer lines not because I
[50:25] was in the meetings I wasn't born yet I
[50:27] didn't have to be born yet we can all be
[50:30] one born out of season praise God we're
[50:32] never born out of season we were born in
[50:35] season this is our season cuz we've been
[50:38] ordained to be Witnesses of his
[50:41] resurrection hallelujah amen praise be
[50:45] to God we live in the day that the word
[50:47] is resurrected again it had been laying
[50:50] as if it was dead through the Dark Ages
[50:52] but by the grace of God it's raised
[50:54] again in the last days day and its power
[50:57] Amen in the
[51:00] promise praise be to
[51:02] God amen
[51:06] amen let's keep reading Acts chapter 9
[51:10] God verse
[51:15] 17 and ananas went his
[51:18] way and entered into the house and
[51:21] putting his hands on him said brother
[51:23] Saul the Lord even Jes Jesus that
[51:25] appeared unto thee in the way as thou
[51:27] comest has sent me oh ananas comes and
[51:32] just confirms you met Jesus
[51:35] Christ amen there was no doubt in his
[51:37] mind you met Jesus
[51:40] Christ Amen brother saw the Lord and he
[51:43] comes and calls him brother listen Hey
[51:45] listen he didn't meet his qualifications
[51:48] he didn't see how God could choose he
[51:49] had no idea naturally but as soon as God
[51:52] said he's a chosen vessel amen there's
[51:54] no more discussion discussions over this
[51:56] was God's choice and ananas had no
[51:58] option but said brother Saul a few days
[52:01] ago he was my enemy I feared him the
[52:03] whole church wanted to stay away we
[52:05] didn't want him to come to Damascus we
[52:06] didn't want to have nothing to do with
[52:08] him amen but in a moment's time God
[52:10] changed anas's whole Paradigm he had to
[52:13] change Paul but he had to change ananas
[52:15] as well until ananas says hey I know
[52:18] what evil he's done to all the saint
[52:20] Lord no way no no no this can't be Lord
[52:23] haven't you heard Hallelujah
[52:27] amen he can't be the one and and and
[52:30] it's almost like God says back to Anan
[52:32] no anas aren't you
[52:35] hearing I have a testimony I have
[52:38] something that I have a record that goes
[52:41] beyond back before he persecuted the
[52:44] church back Beyond his birth amen back
[52:47] Beyond he did right or wrong I have
[52:49] another testimony another record when I
[52:52] ordained him when he was with me in the
[52:54] beginning amen I foresaw this day and I
[52:56] ordained him to take the bishop brick
[52:59] that was left by
[53:02] Judas and ananas who also came in
[53:05] contact with God he had the ability to
[53:08] surrender to the will of God and not to
[53:10] his own
[53:13] thinking so he comes in and says brother
[53:16] Saul amen that's not what he said just a
[53:19] few hours
[53:21] before Oh this is the power of the
[53:25] Living Word this is the power of the
[53:27] Holy Ghost this is the power of the Life
[53:29] of Christ in The Believer it transcends
[53:32] our thoughts our feelings or emotion all
[53:34] the things that we've been trained what
[53:36] we've heard and what we've been taught
[53:37] there's got to be a power that'll break
[53:39] beyond all the natural powers and all
[53:42] the natural reasonings and bring us in
[53:44] line with the will of God ananas himself
[53:47] had to surrender to the will of God that
[53:49] Paul was the
[53:53] choice amen he could have gone on
[53:55] thinking well he no you know he's he's
[53:59] got pretty bad
[54:01] temper he can get pretty
[54:04] cross and he's pretty
[54:06] straight and he's been pretty
[54:09] nasty like I heard reports like when he
[54:12] took the women and children away from
[54:14] their H he was rough with
[54:21] them God this is why we love election
[54:24] and pred
[54:25] we've all been wrong we've all gone
[54:27] wrong we've all thought wrong amen but
[54:29] there's another power that has separate
[54:31] us from ourselves and bring us back amen
[54:34] breaking spiritual Amnesia bringing us
[54:36] back to the right
[54:42] understanding ananas went his way and
[54:44] entered into the house and putting his
[54:46] hands on him said brother Saul the Lord
[54:48] even Jesus that appeared unto thee in
[54:51] the way as thou comest has sent me that
[54:54] thou mightest receive thy sight and be
[54:55] filled with the Holy Ghost and
[54:57] immediately there fell from his eyes as
[54:59] it had been scales and he received sight
[55:03] forth with and arose and was baptized
[55:05] and when he had received meat he was
[55:07] strengthened then was Saul certain days
[55:09] with the disciples which were at
[55:11] Damascus and straight way he preached
[55:14] Christ in the synagogues that he is the
[55:16] Son of God oh he didn't need to training
[55:19] course he didn't need a certain amount
[55:21] of time to soak in amen something
[55:23] happened to him because he was ordained
[55:25] to this office before the foundation of
[55:27] the world he didn't have to become a
[55:29] disciple of a certain right oh yeah but
[55:33] immediately at meeting Christ he had a
[55:36] revelation that's the truth that's
[55:37] nothing but the truth that one that was
[55:39] crucified by us that was the Christ that
[55:42] was the one that was prophesied to come
[55:44] that is the Son of
[55:46] God he knew it he knew it
[55:51] immediately oh let me read that again
[55:53] and straightway he preach Christ in the
[55:55] synagogues that he is the Son of God but
[55:57] all that heard him were amazed and said
[55:59] is not this he that destroyed them which
[56:02] called on this this name in Jerusalem
[56:04] and come hither for the intent that he
[56:06] might bring them bound into the chief
[56:08] priest but Saul increased the more and
[56:10] strength and confounded the Jews which
[56:12] dwelt at Damascus proving that this is
[56:15] very
[56:17] Christ oh he was ordained to that
[56:21] position nothing could stop him we know
[56:24] that immediate IM he had the Revelation
[56:25] immediately he knew and God would bring
[56:28] him right into Damascus and he would
[56:29] confound them knowing the word but then
[56:33] God would take him into Arabia for three
[56:36] and a half years and begin to teach
[56:38] him the word the
[56:40] Mysteries God he already caught the
[56:43] revelation of who Christ was but God
[56:44] would bring him back and he would teach
[56:46] him instruct him himself then he would
[56:48] send him from there to Jerusalem
[56:49] Jerusalem to Antioch and from Antioch he
[56:51] became a missionary around the
[56:53] world Tau by God
[56:57] himself he why he was ordained to that
[57:02] position
[57:03] nobody
[57:05] nobody could argue with Paul they could
[57:09] but they'd be wrong cuz Paul was
[57:12] ordained to that position no one else
[57:14] was sent to set the church in order Paul
[57:16] was ordained to that
[57:19] position and the message
[57:22] influence brother man says they offer of
[57:25] a man in the church is Anointed not
[57:26] appointed it's anointed the pastor the
[57:30] Evangelist the prophet the Apostle must
[57:32] be the anointed office of God Not
[57:34] Elected by man man tried to elect that
[57:37] office one time they cast out Lots poor
[57:40] maias I love how brother B said poor
[57:42] meias can you imagine if that was you
[57:44] and you thought that you were now had
[57:46] the bishop rck you were an apostle and
[57:47] all the apostles have this blessed
[57:49] Ministry and you're
[57:51] trying you think the lot was cast on you
[57:54] and you think you're the one and you're
[57:55] attending I pray I hope God came to Mias
[57:58] at some point and said it's okay Mias
[58:00] amen Paul's the one and Mias go oh thank
[58:04] God I've been trying so hard God because
[58:07] if you're not ordained to it you're not
[58:08] ordained to it amen it's a position that
[58:11] God ordained Maas wasn't ordained to
[58:13] that position that's why the scriptures
[58:14] write nothing of anything that he did or
[58:19] said poor Maas that's the way I feel
[58:21] poor
[58:23] Maas never done nothing but God chose
[58:26] Paul and he did something because he was
[58:30] anointed and we've seen these officers
[58:32] try to say this is Holy Bishop so and so
[58:35] and this state so and so man this is so
[58:37] and so man it never amounts to nothing
[58:39] but when God comes in and takes over
[58:41] then we see the anointing of the Holy
[58:43] Spirit vindicate the word of God Amen
[58:46] this is why amen this is why the church
[58:49] doesn't vote on the
[58:52] offices we vote on deacons we vote on on
[58:54] trustees we vote on Sunday school
[58:56] superintendent but we don't vote on the
[58:59] five Ministry offices because that is
[59:01] ordained by God by
[59:04] foration you can say well we vote on
[59:06] Pastor no you do not vote to make
[59:08] anybody a pastor you vote to submit that
[59:11] this is the pastor God chose for here
[59:13] that man's still a pastor whether you
[59:15] accept him or not if he's ordained to be
[59:17] a pastor he's a pastor he may not belong
[59:19] in this group he'll go somewhere else
[59:20] but you don't vote to make somebody a
[59:22] pastor amen he's a pastor by the
[59:24] foration of God the church just votes to
[59:27] recognize that God called this man to be
[59:29] our pastor and we submit to that but you
[59:32] can't make a man a pastor by a
[59:34] vote right amen amen and if God's
[59:38] ordained that office amen nobody else
[59:40] can take that office nobody can push
[59:42] that man out of that office amen whether
[59:44] it's a pastor evangelist teacher amen
[59:46] Prophet Apostle God's position him there
[59:49] and then and and if the church doesn't
[59:51] get the vote who gets the vote God gets
[59:53] the vote and he votes by vindicating
[59:55] that man's Ministry because in that
[59:57] Ministry Souls will be saved people to
[59:59] be delivered people be he the word will
[1:00:01] be rightly divided it's the Vindication
[1:00:03] of the Holy Ghost that this is the
[1:00:05] ordained
[1:00:07] vessel amen nobody can manufacture it
[1:00:10] nobody can Pump It Up amen nobody can
[1:00:13] copy it it has to be God and God
[1:00:17] Alone amen and it has to be ordained
[1:00:19] from before the foundation of the
[1:00:23] world turn to Galatians chapter
[1:00:43] 1 Galatians
[1:00:48] 1:1 Paul an
[1:00:51] apostle not of men praise God neither by
[1:00:57] man but by Jesus Christ and God the
[1:01:00] Father who raised him from the dead Paul
[1:01:04] knew who made him an
[1:01:07] apostle amen it wasn't the casting of
[1:01:10] lots it wasn't the choice of a
[1:01:12] church it was
[1:01:14] God that's why he could stand when so
[1:01:17] much termoil was going around he could
[1:01:20] stand and declare the truth and stand
[1:01:22] and declare the truth why I mean Deus
[1:01:25] forsook him everybody leaves him he only
[1:01:28] Luke
[1:01:29] Remains the churches he founded now
[1:01:32] rejecting him churches he founded can
[1:01:36] you imagine you come to them they knew
[1:01:39] nothing amen they were heathens they
[1:01:41] were living in Asia Minor in a Greek
[1:01:43] culture mixed with a Roman culture and
[1:01:45] you move in there and you bring to them
[1:01:47] this glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:01:48] they accept it amen they they they now
[1:01:51] listen to you amen you you established
[1:01:53] them as an apostle which is a missionary
[1:01:55] you get them established you place an
[1:01:57] elder there you move on and another
[1:02:00] false yeah Minister moves
[1:02:04] in and begins to seow seeds of
[1:02:07] discrepancy and now they want to cast
[1:02:08] out the Apostle Paul how could he stand
[1:02:11] such thing because he was ordained he's
[1:02:13] an apostle not by man not for man not by
[1:02:16] man but by Jesus Christ
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:21] amen that's why a minister is not voted
[1:02:24] on because he can't live to appease the
[1:02:28] people to win the vote amen right
[1:02:32] because he's not made a minister of the
[1:02:34] Gospel by the vote of the people but by
[1:02:38] the predestinated plan of God and he
[1:02:41] doesn't have the power in Ministry by
[1:02:43] the people he has it by the anointing of
[1:02:45] the Holy Ghost and God vindicates his
[1:02:49] ministries the ones he sends into the
[1:02:52] Earth let's go to revelation chapter
[1:03:16] 19 Revelation
[1:03:20] 19:10 says and I fell at his feet to
[1:03:23] worship him this is the angel that is
[1:03:25] showing all these things to John fellow
[1:03:27] his feet to worship him and he said unto
[1:03:29] me see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[1:03:31] servant and of thy Brethren that have
[1:03:33] the testimony of Jesus this word
[1:03:36] testimony is translated witness 15 times
[1:03:39] 14 times it's translated testimony it
[1:03:42] means a testifying the office committed
[1:03:45] to the prophets of testifying concerning
[1:03:46] future events but also one who settles
[1:03:49] testimony before a judge so it means to
[1:03:51] be a witness to testify to witness he
[1:03:56] says so so he's saying I am thy fellow
[1:04:00] servant of thy Brethren that have the
[1:04:03] testimony of Jesus I have the witness
[1:04:06] and testimony of Jesus worship God for
[1:04:10] the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:04:15] Prophecy what what is the whole point of
[1:04:18] Prophecy and this word prophecy in the
[1:04:21] New Testament is used in multiple ways
[1:04:23] it's used to for tell future events it's
[1:04:25] used to be an oracle of God but it's
[1:04:26] also used for preaching under the
[1:04:29] anointing of God that's why brother
[1:04:31] Brenham said New Testament prophets are
[1:04:33] preachers because that word is used that
[1:04:35] way in the New Testament so it's to to
[1:04:38] Proclaim something by divine
[1:04:40] inspiration amen it can be a future
[1:04:43] event like in what we traditionally call
[1:04:44] prophecy but also preaching falls into
[1:04:47] this same category what's the whole
[1:04:49] purpose of Prophecy it's the testimony
[1:04:52] or witness of Jesus Christ
[1:04:54] that's the point what witness to testify
[1:04:58] that he's
[1:04:59] resurrected he's alive he's present
[1:05:05] tense
[1:05:06] amen I ask I I'll ask all of you a
[1:05:09] rhetorical
[1:05:12] question how do you know that Christ is
[1:05:19] alive it's a good
[1:05:22] question how do you
[1:05:25] know because you can say well I read the
[1:05:28] Bible but how do you know the Bible's
[1:05:31] right well so many people and
[1:05:33] archaeological evidence there's just as
[1:05:36] many people disputing it and more than
[1:05:38] those who are defending it there's just
[1:05:41] as many intellectual papers wrote
[1:05:43] against it as there are for it or even
[1:05:45] if they accept some of it they don't
[1:05:46] accept all of it and they pick it to
[1:05:48] pieces and some of this was written by
[1:05:49] Paul it's authentic some of it's not
[1:05:51] authentic and some of these dates are
[1:05:52] right and they're not right I mean come
[1:05:54] on how do you
[1:05:57] know that Christ is a liive how do you
[1:06:00] know that Christ ever lived Jesus Christ
[1:06:02] ever lived did
[1:06:05] you now he's resurrected we believe that
[1:06:09] but you can get millions to believe that
[1:06:11] because they've been taught that since
[1:06:12] they were a child because there's a
[1:06:13] culture worked all the way around that
[1:06:15] information that's easy to believe it's
[1:06:17] not so easy to believe if you're raised
[1:06:18] in a Muslim culture if you're raised
[1:06:20] Hindu that's not so easy to believe amen
[1:06:23] it's easy to believe believe in a in a
[1:06:24] Christian culture very easy to say Do
[1:06:26] you believe that Jesus Christ lived
[1:06:28] 2,000 years yes did he die for the the
[1:06:29] sins of mankind absolutely amen is he
[1:06:32] alive today absolutely they believe that
[1:06:34] but why do they believe that they
[1:06:35] believe that based off teaching they
[1:06:37] believe it based off information they
[1:06:39] believe it based off of a
[1:06:41] culture but I said God help us never to
[1:06:44] have faith in education or culture or
[1:06:47] traditional teaching we must have
[1:06:48] firsthand experience that Jesus Christ
[1:06:51] is real and is alive
[1:06:54] the question is how do you know that
[1:06:56] Christ is alive that's a question I
[1:06:59] can't answer only you can answer that
[1:07:01] question nobody else can answer that
[1:07:03] question how do you personally know that
[1:07:05] Jesus Christ is alive and if you start
[1:07:07] to look at books and information and
[1:07:09] historical facts you're going to miss
[1:07:11] the whole thing completely CU all of
[1:07:13] that can hinder your faith all of that
[1:07:15] can be twisted and manipulated to cause
[1:07:17] you to disbelief but if you ever meet
[1:07:19] Christ yourself you know that he's alive
[1:07:22] and it doesn't matter intellectual ERS
[1:07:24] or people falling from the mess it
[1:07:26] doesn't matter anymore because you amen
[1:07:28] by firsthand experience have experienced
[1:07:31] Christ the same one that was in the
[1:07:33] Bible that does the same things he does
[1:07:35] in the Bible amen that acted the same
[1:07:37] way he did then acts the same way in
[1:07:41] you amen and then you're not testifying
[1:07:46] off a paper off a document of something
[1:07:49] you read or something you heard you
[1:07:51] become a first count witness amen you
[1:07:54] become as we could say an eyewitness not
[1:07:57] this eyewitness but the eye and the soul
[1:07:59] that can see the truth you become an
[1:08:01] eyewitness of his
[1:08:04] resurrection
[1:08:06] amen praise
[1:08:10] God now's my second
[1:08:13] question how do you know that this
[1:08:17] message is the
[1:08:20] truth how do you know because the
[1:08:23] preacher makes it sounds so good and
[1:08:25] because I read the book cuz I was raised
[1:08:27] in the
[1:08:28] message cuz it makes sense I can see it
[1:08:30] add
[1:08:32] up that's the same thing friends amen it
[1:08:36] can be the same thing like people's
[1:08:38] faith in a real Jesus Christ a real man
[1:08:40] who lived 2,000 years ago who
[1:08:42] resurrected from the dead they believe
[1:08:43] it amen but they believe it on the wrong
[1:08:46] with the wrong kind of Faith they
[1:08:47] believe it on the wrong basis they
[1:08:49] believe it on a basis that can be
[1:08:51] adjusted or moved or questioned
[1:08:58] amen and let's not believe the message
[1:09:00] the same
[1:09:02] way but how do you know this message is
[1:09:06] the
[1:09:07] truth I'll tell
[1:09:09] you the only way to
[1:09:12] know Amen to find out that this message
[1:09:14] is the truth is the same way the Apostle
[1:09:17] Paul found out the message of the
[1:09:19] Resurrection was the truth amen not by
[1:09:21] somebody talking to him and convincing
[1:09:23] him and showing him data and facts and
[1:09:26] eyewitness accounts Paul believed it
[1:09:28] before he met an eyewitness of the
[1:09:30] Resurrection Paul believed it before he
[1:09:33] could go and find well there was 500
[1:09:35] amen that saw him that day let's go talk
[1:09:36] here's three or four here's their
[1:09:38] testimony see how they all line up Paul
[1:09:40] didn't need the testimonies to line up
[1:09:42] he didn't need to meet an eyewitness he
[1:09:44] didn't need to meet Peter first or James
[1:09:46] or John first all he needed to meet was
[1:09:48] Jesus Christ and when he met Jesus
[1:09:50] Christ he knew that Christ was alive he
[1:09:53] knew that he was the Messiah and he knew
[1:09:55] that the message of his day was the
[1:10:01] truth praise
[1:10:07] God
[1:10:09] Amen praise God sometimes I'm fearful
[1:10:12] that as Generations go by and are
[1:10:13] raising the message it'll become what
[1:10:16] the Christian denominations have
[1:10:19] become but we all must have a first hand
[1:10:24] knowledge Yeah by meeting Christ
[1:10:27] ourselves that he's alive and
[1:10:32] well I want to be a witness of his
[1:10:36] resurrection and I want to be a witness
[1:10:38] this message is true I want to testify
[1:10:40] that this message is true not because I
[1:10:42] saw how many people fell off a
[1:10:44] bridge not because I stood and watched
[1:10:47] blind eyes open I mean those are
[1:10:49] wonderful testimonies I love them there
[1:10:50] ain't nothing thing wrong with them I
[1:10:52] listen to them all the time CU they
[1:10:53] encourage encourage me all the time but
[1:10:55] I must be a witness myself and I must be
[1:10:57] a firsthand not a second hand not a
[1:11:00] third party amen that won't even be
[1:11:02] accepted in the court of law amen I must
[1:11:04] be a firsthand authentic witness because
[1:11:07] I myself have experienced
[1:11:10] it
[1:11:13] amen praise
[1:11:16] God but praise the Lord I believe that
[1:11:19] the bride in this day is ordained Yes To
[1:11:25] Be A Witness of the
[1:11:29] Resurrection brother B said God who is
[1:11:31] Rich and mercy said many of you can
[1:11:33] fellowship with me on this
[1:11:36] thought when you was a little boy or a
[1:11:38] little girl you would walk around and
[1:11:39] there would be certain things that would
[1:11:41] just where it wouldn't bother the other
[1:11:43] kids it seemed like there was something
[1:11:44] in you that cried out there was God
[1:11:46] somewhere yet you were a sinner you
[1:11:48] remember that certainly now what was
[1:11:51] that that was that little form of life
[1:11:52] in you then
[1:11:55] and then after a while you heard the
[1:11:56] gospel maybe you went to church you
[1:11:58] picked out this and that and went from
[1:11:59] denomination to denomination but one day
[1:12:02] you being part of God you had to be part
[1:12:04] of the word and when you heard the word
[1:12:07] you knowed where you come from you know
[1:12:10] that was the truth you were always the
[1:12:13] seed was in you
[1:12:15] always the word seen the word that was
[1:12:18] in you and that was before the
[1:12:20] foundation of the world and saw the word
[1:12:23] and you came to
[1:12:27] it Paul was not the only one on the road
[1:12:30] to Damascus
[1:12:33] yeah and he was with the company we
[1:12:36] don't know the number but there was men
[1:12:37] that were with him and in different
[1:12:40] accounts in the in the book of Acts as
[1:12:42] Paul begins to relate this in the book
[1:12:45] that the account we just read it said
[1:12:47] the men were astonished they heard a
[1:12:49] voice but they saw no
[1:12:52] man
[1:12:54] some they heard
[1:12:55] something but they didn't see anything
[1:12:59] another time it says they saw a bright
[1:13:01] light but they heard no
[1:13:07] voice there were other men there and
[1:13:10] there were other men that saw and heard
[1:13:13] things there were other men that could
[1:13:15] attest something Supernatural
[1:13:18] happened they could testify I don't know
[1:13:20] what it was it was strange something
[1:13:22] Supernatural happened then they saw the
[1:13:24] effect it had on Saul who was now
[1:13:25] smitten blind and they had to lead him
[1:13:27] by the hand all the way into the city
[1:13:29] amen they could testify that something
[1:13:32] Supernatural took place amen but they
[1:13:34] were not ordained before the foundation
[1:13:36] of the world when the supernatural fell
[1:13:38] in their presence it wasn't for them it
[1:13:40] was for the one who was ordained to be
[1:13:42] quickened the life when that
[1:13:44] Supernatural fell and when he caught
[1:13:47] that amen when it come in contact with
[1:13:49] him it changed him he received the
[1:13:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost he was
[1:13:53] baptized in jesus' name he took his
[1:13:55] ordained position and became an apostle
[1:13:57] to the Gentiles because he was ordained
[1:13:59] to that
[1:14:00] position amen you and I have been
[1:14:02] ordained if we are the seed of God if
[1:14:04] we're God's children amen elect for this
[1:14:06] day we have been ordained for the day
[1:14:08] that we live in you have been placed
[1:14:10] here by God himself knowing when the sea
[1:14:12] would come forth and what that sea would
[1:14:14] do and you are here amen listen we we
[1:14:17] say it all the time but you are not here
[1:14:20] amen just to live the American dream
[1:14:22] you're not just here to work labor
[1:14:24] retire you may do all of those things
[1:14:26] that's not the primary purpose and those
[1:14:28] things aren't wrong but you are here to
[1:14:30] be a witness of his resurrection you are
[1:14:33] here to testify that this is the truth
[1:14:39] am brother bandam goes on to say like my
[1:14:42] little Eagle story oh how the little
[1:14:44] Eagle was hatched out under a hen the
[1:14:47] little fellow walked with the chickens
[1:14:48] the hen clucked he didn't understand
[1:14:50] their clucking and the little chickens
[1:14:52] their diet they had in the Barnard he
[1:14:54] didn't understand
[1:14:56] that he's telling us the story where a
[1:14:59] farmer takes an eagle egg out of an
[1:15:01] eagle nest and puts it under a hen in
[1:15:04] the barnyard and hatches out an eagle
[1:15:06] with the chickens and now the eagle
[1:15:08] comes forth confused about his identity
[1:15:11] thinking that he's a chicken and
[1:15:13] thinking this thing over me is my
[1:15:15] mother trying to scratch trying to eat
[1:15:18] trying to live like a
[1:15:20] chicken he didn't understand that how
[1:15:23] that they did that but there was
[1:15:24] something in him seemed to be different
[1:15:27] from what that chicken was because of
[1:15:29] the beginning he was a
[1:15:33] eagle I'd say this from the beginning
[1:15:36] you were a son and daughter of God from
[1:15:38] the
[1:15:40] beginning I can say it maybe I could say
[1:15:43] it like this from before the
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:52] beginning
[1:15:54] he said that's the way it is I'm sorry
[1:15:58] he knew something in him seemed to be
[1:15:59] different from what the chicken was
[1:16:01] because at the beginning he was an eagle
[1:16:02] that's right one day his mama come
[1:16:04] hunting him and when he heard the scream
[1:16:06] of the eagle it was different from the
[1:16:07] cluck of the hint and that's the way it
[1:16:09] is with every Born Again believer you
[1:16:11] can hear all the theology you want to
[1:16:12] and all the man-made discrepancies but
[1:16:14] when that word flashes out there then
[1:16:16] there's something takes a hold and you
[1:16:19] come to it amen you who were once dead
[1:16:22] in sin that life has he quickened there
[1:16:25] has been there has to be a life there to
[1:16:27] Quicken to first God by his forn
[1:16:29] knowledge knowed all things and we were
[1:16:31] predestinated to be Sons and Daughters
[1:16:34] of God ye were once dead in sin and
[1:16:36] trespasses wherein we all had our time
[1:16:39] our times pass but hath he
[1:16:41] quickened look at Paul when Paul was a
[1:16:44] great Theologian but when he came face
[1:16:46] to face with that word Jesus it
[1:16:49] quickened amen what did he come face to
[1:16:51] face with with the word yes yeah what
[1:16:53] word the word for his day the
[1:16:55] resurrection of Jesus Christ and now the
[1:16:57] Life of Christ in the Believers that's
[1:16:58] what he came face to face with amen he
[1:17:01] said when he came face to face with the
[1:17:02] word comma
[1:17:05] Jesus it quickened
[1:17:08] amen he came to life right quick because
[1:17:11] he was ordained to be that amen he was
[1:17:15] part of the word and when the word saw
[1:17:17] the word it was his nature all the
[1:17:19] clucking of the hens the Orthodox
[1:17:21] Churches didn't have no effect upon him
[1:17:23] he had saw the word it was part of him
[1:17:25] he was an eagle he wasn't a chicken he
[1:17:27] was just in the Barnard with him but he
[1:17:29] was an eagle to begin
[1:17:33] with he goes on and says impr proving
[1:17:35] his word how does he make his word known
[1:17:37] to the people first God knowing that
[1:17:39] there would be
[1:17:41] unbelievers God knew that the fall would
[1:17:43] take place that's why Jesus Christ was
[1:17:46] the lamb slain from before the
[1:17:47] foundation of the world he knew there
[1:17:50] would be unbelievers now watch the
[1:17:52] wisdom of God knowing there would be
[1:17:55] unbelievers and how the majority would
[1:17:57] be
[1:17:58] unbelievers he by forn knowledge
[1:18:00] predestinated a seed for every age that
[1:18:03] would believe it he knew there would be
[1:18:06] a fall he knew there would be seeds of
[1:18:08] discrepancy sewn into the human race and
[1:18:10] he knew it bring forth a crop of tears
[1:18:12] and he knew the unbelievers would be the
[1:18:13] majority so what did he do he
[1:18:15] predestinated for orain that there would
[1:18:18] be real seed real Believers planted in
[1:18:21] each age yeah amen so what are you
[1:18:26] you're part of that plan because he knew
[1:18:29] this would be Satan's Eden because he
[1:18:30] knew it' be a le le to and a because he
[1:18:32] knew it'd be religious darkness and
[1:18:35] absolute apostasy amen because he knew
[1:18:37] it he knew by Foreign Nation I've got to
[1:18:40] plant a seed there that'll take this
[1:18:42] word and stand with it amen in the face
[1:18:44] of all the religious opposition in the
[1:18:46] face of all the darkness in the face of
[1:18:49] all the sin and immorality amen I
[1:18:51] planted a seed there list listen you
[1:18:53] don't believe this message because you
[1:18:54] were smart you don't believe this
[1:18:56] message because you're mom and dad if
[1:18:57] you believe this message you believe it
[1:18:59] because you were ordained to from before
[1:19:01] the foundation of the world and God knew
[1:19:03] that this world would be riddled with
[1:19:04] unbelievers so he would plant his seed
[1:19:07] in every age and you came forth Amen to
[1:19:10] prove that this word is true you came
[1:19:12] forth to testify of the message that's
[1:19:15] why you and I are
[1:19:20] here and it's the devil's job to
[1:19:22] distract Us by every technique you can
[1:19:24] from that purpose to use work to use
[1:19:27] family to use obligation to use the
[1:19:28] busyness of life to use all the weeds
[1:19:31] that creep up he's the devil is using
[1:19:33] every attempt he can sickness
[1:19:35] discouragement trials tribulation
[1:19:37] rejections he's using every attempt to
[1:19:39] stop you from that purpose cuz that's
[1:19:42] God's purpose for
[1:19:45] you
[1:19:47] amen sometimes we preach we preach so
[1:19:49] hard amen sometimes against
[1:19:51] entertainment and world Hess and being
[1:19:53] CAU amen it's not because we're trying
[1:19:56] to push a Holiness movement to make
[1:19:57] everybody look right amen so that we can
[1:19:59] say oh we're holy it's because those
[1:20:01] things are actually weeds creepers
[1:20:04] creeping around to pull the very
[1:20:05] manifestation out of you that God has
[1:20:07] ordained you to be here for he wants us
[1:20:10] cut free from the things of the world
[1:20:12] free from the entertainments that
[1:20:13] pollute our mind amen free from all the
[1:20:16] signals that are coming amen from that
[1:20:18] fourth dimension to try to what dull our
[1:20:21] senses and pull us down amen but praise
[1:20:24] God we got to shake that stuff off and
[1:20:26] come to the word because the word has to
[1:20:29] come to life where will it come to life
[1:20:31] in the for ordained
[1:20:35] seeds this is why we don't watch movies
[1:20:37] this is why we don't have television
[1:20:38] this is why we don't caught up in all
[1:20:40] that stuff my goodness it's not because
[1:20:42] you can say if if your eyes lay across
[1:20:44] the video you're going to hell my
[1:20:46] goodness it's not that it's because
[1:20:48] everything's produced in the fourth
[1:20:50] dimension it's produced by demon power
[1:20:52] and there's influences there and even if
[1:20:54] it's not outright evil it's
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:20:59] distracting it's so entertaining it's so
[1:21:02] gripping it's so distracting it may not
[1:21:04] be evil you may be learning amen how to
[1:21:07] build something amen I'd like to build
[1:21:09] something someday and so I'm going to
[1:21:11] look at building raised flower beds
[1:21:13] right Hey listen I did it it was super
[1:21:16] helpful 15 minutes I could go do it I
[1:21:19] mean I kept
[1:21:21] replaying
[1:21:24] the problem is it's so good well what
[1:21:26] about this video what about this and 4
[1:21:28] hours later I've learned how to build a
[1:21:30] raise beted I could have built it in
[1:21:35] two so we're not against using tools for
[1:21:38] tools we're not against everything in
[1:21:40] the world what we're against is anything
[1:21:42] that'll take me from the purpose he
[1:21:44] pre-ordained me to be anything that robs
[1:21:46] my mind robs my time takes my affections
[1:21:48] God help me please to be free from this
[1:21:51] world help me be free from all the ties
[1:21:54] that try to
[1:21:58] bind
[1:21:59] amen praise the lord it's not Holiness
[1:22:02] and legalism to be strict but oh praise
[1:22:05] God I think we'd do a little better to
[1:22:06] be a little
[1:22:09] stricter not to get acceptance from God
[1:22:11] not to get a merit back not to prove
[1:22:13] we're better but to be free to be free
[1:22:16] to express to be free Amen to read the
[1:22:19] word to pray to meditate Amen to think
[1:22:22] on God Amen so that God can move through
[1:22:25] us with the very purpose he's planted us
[1:22:27] here
[1:22:31] for I mean don't get me wrong if I've
[1:22:33] got to fix my car tomorrow I am going to
[1:22:36] probably watch a YouTube
[1:22:40] video praise God but I don't need to
[1:22:43] watch 10
[1:22:46] 12 and then that was really cool but oh
[1:22:48] look he jacked it up he put a 4-in lift
[1:22:50] on it and look oh what why am I watching
[1:22:52] and he put a 4in lift on it I needed to
[1:22:54] figure out how to change the
[1:22:58] timing you see how slick the devil
[1:23:03] is not the pursuit of evil we're beyond
[1:23:07] that but oh God help me to recognize my
[1:23:10] purpose I am here to be a witness of the
[1:23:18] Resurrection God's only provided place
[1:23:20] of worship he says if I taught you
[1:23:22] Methodist message it would take no
[1:23:23] effect on
[1:23:25] you this is bride
[1:23:27] time if Moses taught the message no it
[1:23:30] would take no effect if Jesus taught
[1:23:31] Moses message it would take no effect
[1:23:33] because the predestinated seeds are
[1:23:35] laying there that will only be watered
[1:23:37] by the type of water that's give for
[1:23:39] that seed God knew there' be
[1:23:43] unbelievers in this age so he planted

[1:23:49] one thing that's going to bring this
[1:23:50] seed to life it's the word word for this
[1:23:53] age will bring the seed for this age to
[1:23:55] life amen they're they're polarized to
[1:23:57] each other they're magnetized to each
[1:23:59] other and when the word for the age
[1:24:01] comes in contact with the seed for this
[1:24:03] age that God ordained amen it quickens
[1:24:05] it to life and now that seed Springs
[1:24:07] forth to life and the power of the word
[1:24:09] comes into that life to live out the
[1:24:11] word and as it lives the word it
[1:24:14] manifests the word when the word says be
[1:24:16] separate they live separate when the
[1:24:18] word says do these things they do these
[1:24:19] things when the word says forsake not
[1:24:21] the assembling they forsake what is it
[1:24:23] it's the manifested word in
[1:24:25] [Applause]

[1:24:31] declares a witness that Christ is
[1:24:35] alive amen it's a witness that the word
[1:24:38] is
[1:24:46] true notice the anointed word of this
[1:24:51] day of which you are a
[1:24:54] part by
[1:24:57] predestination listen friends it's not
[1:25:00] just that you being a predestinated seed
[1:25:02] came in contact with the word for the
[1:25:04] day and sprung you to life no you're
[1:25:06] actually part of the word for your
[1:25:11] day amen listen to the message that God
[1:25:15] gave Saul on the road to
[1:25:19] Damascus Saul Saul why persecutest thou
[1:25:26] me who is the me Jesus
[1:25:30] Christ who was Paul persecuting the
[1:25:33] church
[1:25:36] amen Jesus gave him the revelation of
[1:25:39] the word for his day yes and all those
[1:25:42] Believers were part of that
[1:25:45] predestinated
[1:25:48] word amen and so Paul was also part of
[1:25:52] that word word but it took the
[1:25:53] manifested word Christ in those
[1:25:56] Believers and that Revelation through a
[1:25:58] meeting Christ himself to awaken that in
[1:26:00] Paul it took that to put Paul in his
[1:26:03] position because he was also the word
[1:26:04] for that day because there was there was
[1:26:07] prophecies laying in the book of Isaiah
[1:26:09] that says it would be a light unto the
[1:26:10] Gentiles who fulfilled that it was
[1:26:12] fulfilled by Christ in Paul
[1:26:15] amen so it took the word for his day to
[1:26:17] Quicken the seed for the day because
[1:26:19] that seed was meant to be the predestin
[1:26:22] word for that day amen we're not to
[1:26:24] believe the message we are to believe
[1:26:26] the message but not stop at believ we

[1:26:32] the Believers that that Pillar of Fire
[1:26:34] is living and we are here to show forth
[1:26:36] that what that Prophet preached was

[1:26:41] truth that you can live above the world
[1:26:44] that you can live a Sanctified clean
[1:26:46] holy life that there's power for healing
[1:26:48] there's demonstrations of the spirit

[1:27:00] marriage he he cleansed my mind he cut
[1:27:02] me free from vices of the world I'm here
[1:27:04] to testify that that word that that man
[1:27:06] preached is living right here in this
[1:27:09] vessel and we are part of the
[1:27:11] predestinated word for this
[1:27:15] age brother B said uh in the message
[1:27:19] Witnesses back in 53 he says they can't
[1:27:21] witness until they have an
[1:27:23] experience that's true cuz what are you
[1:27:25] going to witness somebody else's
[1:27:27] experience that makes you a second party
[1:27:30] witness that's a weak
[1:27:35] testimony they can't witness until they
[1:27:37] have an experience and when they have an
[1:27:39] experience then they become a witness
[1:27:43] automatically what do you mean
[1:27:45] automatically because you were a
[1:27:47] witness the immediately when you
[1:27:50] experience the the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:53] Ghost you become a witness what do you
[1:27:54] mean become because you experienced it

[1:28:24] witness because they were born again and

[1:32:08] but what God has
[1:32:11] ordained let's go to Revelation 12
[1:32:16] now I want to lay in a couple more
[1:32:18] verses as we move down here to the
[1:32:20] finish line
[1:32:22] Revelation
[1:32:26] 12 verse
[1:32:29] 10 and they that dwell upon the Earth
[1:32:31] shall rejoice over them and make Merry

[1:32:36] them no I'm in 11 sorry 1210 I'm in the
[1:32:40] wrong
[1:32:40] chapter 1210 and I heard a loud voice
[1:32:44] saying in heaven now has come salvation
[1:32:47] and strength in the Kingdom of our God
[1:32:48] and the power of His Christ for the
[1:32:49] accuser of our Brethren is cast down

[1:32:54] and night amen when is the devil cast
[1:32:57] down when the bride goes up when the
[1:32:59] bride goes up he comes down verse 11 and
[1:33:02] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:33:04] lamb and by the word of their
[1:33:07] testimony which is the word
[1:33:11] witness and they love not their lives
[1:33:14] unto death they overcame them by the
[1:33:17] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[1:33:21] will
[1:33:22] witness they had something to
[1:33:26] testify they were a true witness because
[1:33:30] they had a firsthand
[1:33:36] experience brother BR the message again
[1:33:39] Witnesses he said a few moments by the
[1:33:41] clock to speak to you about Witnesses
[1:33:43] Jesus said here you shall receive power
[1:33:45] after the holy spirit's come upon you
[1:33:47] and then you shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:33:49] not when you join the church you'll be
[1:33:51] you be a witness not when you become a
[1:33:52] deacon you'll be a witness not when
[1:33:54] you're ordained to minister you shall
[1:33:56] become a witness but when the Holy Ghost
[1:33:58] has come upon you then you shall be then
[1:34:00] you'll be a witness a witness must be
[1:34:03] someone with an
[1:34:04] experience must know something in the
[1:34:07] courts of our land you can't come up and
[1:34:09] say Miss so and so told me so and so
[1:34:11] about so and so they'll throw you the
[1:34:13] case out right then you've got to be
[1:34:15] either an eye or an ear witness you've
[1:34:17] got to know something before you can be
[1:34:19] a witness and you've got to know
[1:34:21] something before you can be a witness of
[1:34:23] God and all God calleded Witnesses are
[1:34:25] people with experience of knowing what
[1:34:27] they're speaking
[1:34:29] about praise God sometimes we wonder why
[1:34:33] we go through so many things and why we
[1:34:34] have so many trials and difficulties and
[1:34:36] sickness my goodness praise the Lord I
[1:34:38] can now testify to you that God's A
[1:34:40] Healer I can testify I can give
[1:34:42] firsthand witness he's healed me he's
[1:34:45] delivered me he's changed
[1:34:48] me yeah you must have the experience
[1:34:51] experience to be a witness I can tell
[1:34:53] you all about the healing campaigns that
[1:34:55] he did Amen in brother benham's Ministry
[1:34:57] that will encourage me that will build
[1:34:59] faith in me amen but that is all
[1:35:01] secondhand information for me but what's
[1:35:04] firsthand information for me is when I
[1:35:06] was sick he delivered me amen when I was
[1:35:08] needy he provided for me he heard my
[1:35:11] private prayer and he answered
[1:35:14] publicly
[1:35:17] amen amen and in time of evangelism he
[1:35:21] said the heathens when they worship
[1:35:22] their Idol they prostrate themselves
[1:35:24] before the idol and believe that the
[1:35:26] idol talk back to them that God their
[1:35:28] God turned come into the idol and spoke
[1:35:30] back through them now that's just
[1:35:32] contrary turned around what God is God
[1:35:34] doesn't deal with Idols you are his
[1:35:37] instrumentl you prostrate yourself
[1:35:39] before God and he comes in you and
[1:35:42] speaks out to the
[1:35:44] people amen not through a dumb Idol not
[1:35:47] through a statue not an idolatry they
[1:35:48] come and expect to get an answer no you
[1:35:51] you yourself Surrender Your Vessel your
[1:35:54] clay amen your Tabernacle to him and he
[1:35:57] comes in you and now he speaks out of
[1:36:00] you unto the world Amen you're something
[1:36:02] that's portraying God you're something
[1:36:04] that's speaking God's word and you might
[1:36:07] speak it with words or you might speak
[1:36:09] it with actions but nonetheless you're
[1:36:10] testifying of the life that's on the
[1:36:15] inside that's the difference he's the
[1:36:17] Living God for a living person not a
[1:36:19] dead God to a dead Idol he's a Living
[1:36:21] God to a living being and you become his
[1:36:23] Witnesses what he said here and if I
[1:36:26] told you the spirit of John Diller was
[1:36:29] in me I'd have guns here and be an
[1:36:31] outlaw because that would be his spirit
[1:36:33] in me if I told you the spirit of artist
[1:36:36] of an artist you'd expect me to paint
[1:36:38] the picture of an artist if I tell you I
[1:36:41] am a Christian and the spirit of Christ
[1:36:43] is in me or in you then we do the works
[1:36:46] of
[1:36:48] Christ that's the witness
[1:36:52] Jesus said in St John he that believeth
[1:36:54] on me the works that I do shall he do
[1:36:55] also then he said here these signs shall
[1:36:58] follow them that believe brother made it
[1:37:01] so simple if John Diller was in me I'd
[1:37:03] have guns I'd rob banks if if Beethoven
[1:37:06] was in me I write songs why because I
[1:37:08] manifest the life that's on the
[1:37:10] inside but how can I testify that Christ
[1:37:14] lives in me and I deny his word and go
[1:37:17] contrary to his word and refuse his word
[1:37:19] and trample all over what he said is
[1:37:21] shows that I'm a f I'm bearing false
[1:37:24] witness amen that's right yeah but I
[1:37:28] don't want to bear false witness I want
[1:37:29] to give a true report so if I'm going to
[1:37:31] give a true report amen I need Christ to
[1:37:34] come and and burn everything out of me
[1:37:35] and live himself in me because I don't
[1:37:37] have the capacity in myself Amen to
[1:37:40] reflect Christ his nature is too perfect
[1:37:42] his word is too true amen it takes more
[1:37:44] than human effort it's going to take the
[1:37:46] power of the Holy Ghost and I say God
[1:37:48] I'm prostrating myself before you burn
[1:37:51] me me out fill me up Quicken this seed
[1:37:53] to life and use me for your glory and
[1:37:55] let me rise and be a true witness of a
[1:37:58] true life on the inside
[1:38:02] amen
[1:38:06] amen Jesus told his disciples in John
[1:38:09] 14 said if a man love
[1:38:12] me he will keep my words and my father
[1:38:15] will love him and we will come unto him
[1:38:18] and make our Abode with him
[1:38:22] where is he going to live
[1:38:25] here right
[1:38:27] here making me a witness of the
[1:38:31] resurrected life of Jesus
[1:38:35] Christ not because I made myself a
[1:38:38] witness not because I decided to witness
[1:38:41] but because he ordained me the same way
[1:38:43] he ordained Paul same way ordained Moses
[1:38:46] everyone that's been ordained to their
[1:38:48] place he ordained me and wherever he's
[1:38:51] ordained me I don't need to I I don't
[1:38:55] need to have this imagination that if
[1:38:57] God wants to speak through me I'll be
[1:38:59] behind the pull pit or I'll be on the
[1:39:00] street witnessing or no my goodness
[1:39:03] you're testifying every day of your life
[1:39:05] you're testifying in your homes your
[1:39:07] test I I remember a story I remember
[1:39:10] years ago amen our oldest son Blake I've
[1:39:12] told this testimony before but he was
[1:39:14] having severe issues with
[1:39:15] flat-footedness and it was causing pain
[1:39:17] down the back of his legs severe pain
[1:39:20] sometimes at the end of the day he would
[1:39:21] crawl on his hands and knees up the
[1:39:23] steps because it hurt too bad to walk up
[1:39:25] the steps so we didn't know what to do
[1:39:27] so so we we talked to a few specialist
[1:39:29] and we found out that we could get heal
[1:39:30] inserts for him that would correct the
[1:39:33] the the the the feet raise his arch and
[1:39:36] that seemed to help we had to keep them
[1:39:38] in there and that caused some other kind
[1:39:39] of pain but it worked for a while but
[1:39:42] one day amen some of the kids were
[1:39:44] homesick and and my wife was home with
[1:39:46] all the little kids and I was here at
[1:39:48] church and I'm pretty sure I was by
[1:39:50] myself and that day we were having a
[1:39:52] prayer
[1:39:53] line and people were coming and getting
[1:39:55] prayed for and I was here as one of the
[1:39:57] ministers I believe at the time praying
[1:39:59] for the people and back home my wife
[1:40:02] said God you know if we were there we
[1:40:05] would have Blake in the heel prayer line
[1:40:07] we believe you and something spoke in
[1:40:09] her heart you don't need to be
[1:40:14] there hallelujah amen she had walked
[1:40:17] into the kitchen she was doing something
[1:40:19] she'd walked back and she told the kids
[1:40:21] that gathered all these little kids
[1:40:22] Blake was probably 10 or 11 at the time
[1:40:24] they were all younger gathered all these
[1:40:25] little kids around and told them you
[1:40:27] know we were there we'd have Blake
[1:40:28] prayed for and this is what I believe
[1:40:30] God told me and prayed and God healed
[1:40:33] that boy right there what was that that
[1:40:36] was a witness of the Resurrection not in
[1:40:39] a pull pit but in a home that was Christ
[1:40:41] clothed in a mother who had concern for
[1:40:43] her son what was that there was none
[1:40:45] other than the resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:40:48] that has the capacity to believe his own
[1:40:49] word and see it come to pass don't think
[1:40:53] that you have to go travel some distance
[1:40:55] or stand on a street corner you witness
[1:40:58] where you're at witness to the
[1:40:59] co-workers witness to your children to
[1:41:01] your grandchildren witness to your
[1:41:03] husband witness to your wife I've been
[1:41:04] sick laying in bed not feeling well and
[1:41:06] I asked my wife I'll grab her hand and
[1:41:08] put it on me and I say pray with me cuz
[1:41:10] I believe if they lay hands on the sick
[1:41:12] they shall recover and I've seen that
[1:41:14] simple Act of Faith and it wasn't even
[1:41:17] that she was saying something I was
[1:41:18] praying I just grabbed her I needed a
[1:41:20] believer's
[1:41:24] hand and I laid her hand on me what is
[1:41:26] that that's the witness of the
[1:41:29] resurrection of Jesus Christ that this
[1:41:31] word works and it's happened in your
[1:41:32] life again and time again and time again
[1:41:35] and it will continue to happen but we
[1:41:37] have to recognize that's the witness of
[1:41:39] the
[1:41:42] Resurrection testifying living this word
[1:41:45] demonstrating this word amen standing

[1:45:42] were dead in trespasses and sins am
[1:45:44] wherein in time past you walked
[1:45:46] according to the course of this world
[1:45:47] according to the prince of the power of
[1:45:49] the air the spirit spirit that now
[1:45:51] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[1:45:53] among whom also we all had our
[1:45:55] conversation in times past in the lust
[1:45:57] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:45:59] the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[1:46:01] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:46:03] others is that true yes we were just
