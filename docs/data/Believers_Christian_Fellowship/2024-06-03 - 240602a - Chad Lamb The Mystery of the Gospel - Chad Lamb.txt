this morning God I pray you give us ears to hear a heart to perceive Lord all that you have may you grant us your spirit of Revelation upon your word we love you may you be the glorified one in our midst in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated for just a moment thank you musicians amen I just want to give you a little update I uh had a chance to uh text with brother Emanuel saasu and he made it safely to the Democratic Republic of Congo he's beginning his work he had a Sunday morning service so they ahead of us so I think he's already preached today he's got a service Tuesday and then Wednesday then he's flying over to the Northeast Province to do some work over there for a few days so just remember him in prayer and remember his family that is here and we don't want to forget him also want to thank you all for your prayers for our family these last few days the the funeral uh went went well it went really well and we appreciate those of you who made it down for the visitation and for the funeral may God bless you for that it really meant a lot to us and it meant a lot to my mom and uh she's been appreciating all the text and all the cards and all the sympathy that you've expressed and it's been a real blessing and a real encouragement to her so God bless you all and thank you for that amen if you ever want to know how important a body is just wait till a trial a difficulty H your family and you realize how much you love God's family amen how much they mean to you also want to let you know that uh this coming Sunday a week from today I'll be going down to preach in Junction City to the ex Alish group of Believers down there they called and ask me uh some time ago and we've been working on it so that date works out well so I'll be going there but also I got a call from Brother son Simon Abbott from UK he called me a few weeks ago and told me that he's coming so him and his wife and his wife's mother sister ponnie will be here uh actually late Wednesday night they arrive in Cleveland and drive down so they'll be here I think for about two weeks and so when I found out he was going to be here the same time I was going to be gone I called and asked him if he would take the service and he said he would so I said well thank God he provided amen so it was just good timing so also pray for their traveling they'll be they'll be leaving uh I think Wednesday early morning so pray for them and then pray if you don't mind pray for us remember us for that service next Sunday I'll remind you again on Wednesday and then also for the service here amen thank god let's all stand if we could let's turn to Ephesians chapter 6 Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 18 verse 18 Paul's just instructing the Saints to pray he says praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me so he's saying pray for me also that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak amen God bless you as you're seated may God bless us as we look at his word amen I don't know brother Brenham made the statement I don't I I'm not going to quote it exactly right but he made the statement something like preaching is never something you get used to and I I'm exactly the same way I'm standing here and and in uh in turmoil because everything gets all mixed up and jumbled up and you have one thing in your mind and you're pretty sure you're going to do something and then late in the evening the night before God changes everything and so we're going in a different direction than I thought we were going to go in so that doesn't bother you any but it bothers me a whole lot amen so I probably shouldn't even tell you because it doesn't make any difference but but for me I get all jumbled up so I'm standing here by faith amen saying God I just trust your leadership and we're asking God to take control and speak his word that he would Minister through a gift Amen brother B said a gift is just to get yourself out of the way and so that's what I'm struggling to do right now is pull it into another gear and get myself relaxed so that God can take over but when we get to this subject this is something that I was reading in my just my daily devotion just my Bible reading and it struck me and I got excited about it I never intended to preach on it I just got excited about it and then yesterday afternoon it started working on and by evening I I knew I had to go this direction but when Paul is asking for prayer he's asking prayer that utterance may be given unto me that I might open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the gospel and that phrase struck my heart he wasn't asking that he would have boldness to preach the gospel but the mystery of the gospel because there's there's a gospel but there's a mystery of the Gospel as well amen and that's what Paul was wanting to get over was the The Mystery of the Gospel that had been given to him and uh and he was preaching in a mystery and it's amazing how many times Paul talks about preaching the mystery the hidden things the mystery that had not been known and now he wants to boldly preach the mystery of the Gospel what he is an ambassador for when we look up this word mystery in the Greek this is the definition that it gives a hidden thing a secret generally Mysteries religious Secrets uh confided only to the initiated and not to ordinary Mortals something about that definition just got my juices going amen uh religious Secrets confided only to the initiated and not to ordinary Mortals hey I don't want to be an ordinary mortal amen I want to be one of the initiated he also says here there's several different definitions I'll read this next one a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding that's why listen we can't intellectually go to the Bible amen and be able to draw these things out amen because it doesn't come that way these things are written in Mysteries it takes the spirit of Revelation Amen to pull out what is not obvious to the understanding I mean we have because of because of of education and because of a translation of the Bible amen there's an intelligence that can give us understanding of words that we read but that won't give you the understanding of the mystery it'll only give you the understanding of the text and understanding the text doesn't equal to understanding the mystery amen amen we'll get into that in a minute the next definition he says a hidden purpose or counsel secret will of men of God the secret councils which govern God in dealing with the righteous which are hidden from ungodly and wicked men but plain to The Godly amen I love these definitions I mean we're just going to preach out of the concordance amen am because these things are not obvious to the understanding and its ways in which God is dealing with his children or his elect amen and it's not known or revealed to the wicked or ungodly but it's made plain to The Godly amen it's something that's not obvious to understanding but it's plain made plain by Revelation to The Godly and that's why for you it's so easy to see the message you just see it you can't help from see it brother bam said once you see this message you can't see anything else to you it's been plainly revealed amen because it was for you amen but it wasn't obvious to understanding that's why when you go to explain it to somebody a coworker a family member they said I just can't get it I just don't know what you're saying it doesn't make sense to me and then all of a sudden you realize the gospel amen you're you're speaking now the mystery of the Gospel yes right not what's on the surface but what's hidden in the text let's go to Ephesians chapter 3 Ephesians chapter 3: 1 for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you word how that by Revelation he may known unto me the mystery as I wrote a four and few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so now Paul's saying I have a revelation of the mystery of Christ and this is I I you've heard the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me to you how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery so God revealed it them him amen it's a mystery it wasn't something obvious to the understanding and the question is where is Paul going to go to get this mystery amen he's got to go to Christ God's got to reveal to him the mystery amen and then once he gets the mystery then he's going to go back to his Bible and when he goes back to his Bible with the revelation of the mystery he's going to pull it out of the Old Testament amen right amen but he wasn't able to pull it out of the Old Testament before he sat at the feet of gel he he was in the best teaching the best school that he could be in and he wasn't able to pull this mystery himself until he met Christ he met the pillar of fire and he went and learned the mystery of Christ amen and then he went back to the Bible and when he went back to the Bible after his eyes had been open amen then he could see the mystery all through the scriptures praise God now let's read this again verse 5 which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men a as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow Hees of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith faith of him praise God let's go to First Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 2 1 Corinthians chap 2 Verse 6 how be it we speak wisdom among them are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory he said they didn't know it if they had known it they would have if they had known the truth of who Jesus Christ was they would have never crucified him but they didn't know but he says we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery now he wanted to he was praying for the Ephesian church amen to pray for him that utterance would be given to him that he could speak boldly The Mystery of the Gospel amen and you can boldly speak the mystery of the Gospel but you're still preaching in a mystery you're still speaking in a mystery amen because it's only for those who have the receptor on the inside that can pick up the mystery because it's not obvious to the understanding amen amen which which makes me thank God Almighty that he put something in me before the foundation of the world a receptor that could receive amen the mystery when the mystery is preached boldly it was preached boldly by the prophet it's been preached boldly by many men amen and it goes over the tops of so many heads but by the grace of God he has put something in his elect seed amen that it won't just go over the head and it won't just rattle around in the head for debate and discussion and confusion but it'll strike a Crystal amen it'll strike a receiver down in the soul that'll say that ain't nothing but the truth amen without the intellect being able to tie all the pieces together something will say that's the truth by the grace of God Amen so let's go to Romans 16 Romans 16:25 now to him that is of power now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began amen if you want to be established amen you need you need the gospel but you need the re revelation of the mystery amen yes the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever amen amen praise God so now the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul now is is on a journey he's on a journey to Damascus because he's going to to haul this new sect of these uh of these religious blasphemers those that he thought were polluting and corrupting the word of God and he goes out zealous for the word of God and he gets dispatched with letters from the high priest and from the elders to go and on the way to Damascus he comes in contact with the Lord Jesus Christ and he was in the form of a pillar of fire and it smoted him down to the ground he called out Amen to him and he identified himself that Pillar of Fire was Jesus Christ whom he was persecuting but he wasn't persecuting amen a body a human body that was Jesus Christ was dwelling dwelling in he was persecuting the church that Jesus Christ was dwelling in those were the bodies and and all of a sudden he got a revelation right there and then he went out into the Arabian to the desert to receive the The Mystery of the Bible amen and he received it by Christ himself by Revelation amen because there was a measure of disp sensation of Grace given to him to us word amen then he come out preaching the mystery of the Gospel amen and and even in this day there's so many people that get the gospel but what about the mystery of the Gospel right there's so many people that are hitting a surface level of the gospel and they're understanding that Jesus Christ came and died for Sinners and and that he shed his blood on Calvary to redeem back the world and those that are lost and amen there's a surface of the Gospel but my there's mystery in that amen there's a mystery in Calvary and the Mystery lay inside Jesus Christ while he was nailed to the cross on Calvary there was a mystery in there amen the Apostle Paul comes now when he gets the revelation of this mystery now he's recognizing amen who Christ is that he's the Messiah that all the prophets were speaking of him that everything that was prophesied had now taken place and he's able to go back with his eyes open listen he I I I I I don't understand I don't know how to say it let's just say it this way I don't know how to say what I want to say so you just bear with me for a minute it doesn't work backwards he doesn't study study study study study and all of a sudden know the mystery amen God comes to him and reveals to him the mystery and then when he goes back to the book it all unfolds he can go back amen all those years with Gia all those studying of the Bibles and reading of the Scrolls and the time spent in the in the temple he said he had to count it as dung that he might know and win Christ amen but it doesn't mean now he quit reading his Bible and he gave up on the Scrolls no when he's still in prison amen he's asking I think it is Timothy to come and bring him the parchments and especially the Scrolls he wants his Bible yeah why because his eyes are open and now he can see the mystery that he had missed all of his life and that in ages before they were Godly men they were men of God they were the right kind of man in the right season but this mystery was veiled and they couldn't see it either and neither could the Apostle Paul see it until God lifted the veil off of his eyes amen and then he comes and he starts preaching things that absolutely Rock the foundation of the Jewish World they can't take it they absolutely can't take what he saying he he they they he says you know when he's standing uh uh in the court he says and the way that is called heresy is the way that I worship he didn't say he worshiped by heresy but the way it's called heresy because it was so different amen the their understanding of the Bible that they thought he was a heretic they wanted to kill him and destroy him because they thought he was blaspheming and destroying the the word of God and in their effort to protect the truth yeah right they were trying to kill the one whose eyes was open to the truth see it's not an abundance of study that brings the Revelation the revelation is the grace of God Amen the word must be preached and under the preaching of the word amen there's a there's there's a there's a release of the Revelation and those with a receptor can catch it and and after they catch it they go back say it's right there how did I miss it like you go to the scripture that says amen baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and when you go back to Matthew uh 28:19 he said in the name of the father and the son and of the Holy Ghost then all of a sudden when the when the light switch flips you say it says name there's just only one name amen it doesn't say names plural it's just name I mean you wouldn't believe how many people you try to explain that to and you explain it and they say yeah I don't understand he says yeah that's what he said Father Son and Holy Ghost yeah but you say no he said name not names plural name yeah father son I mean because there's got to be a receptor on the inside and all of a sudden when it goes off it just goes off and once you see it you can't see anything else it's just there right amen that's why for me I I I don't I I I don't understand some of the ideology that we have sometimes that we have to make things simple I think the gospel's simple I think the message is simple amen and sometimes when there's an adversion to preaching on Mysteries listen that's all Paul preached Paul preached the mystery that was hid from the foundation of the world but now is made known amen Paul Paul's whole Ministry his whole Ministry was preaching the Mysteries that was veiled in the Old Testament amen amen so so there's not there's there's no need amen for us to say you know don't preach on the Mysteries and don't that that that the message the message is the mystery that was laying in the New Testament amen that's what brother Brandon was called to do is come and break that mystery for us and so that's where I I sometimes I get concerned at the direction sometimes I see things going in a pool to try to bring things down to simplify it and it seems like what we're trying to do sometimes is we're trying to make it obvious to the intellect yeah yeah but a mystery is something that's not obvious to the intellect but it's plainly seen by The Godly amen amen and so so when we have a desire it's like I how can I how can I simplify this so that everybody can catch it well the reality is everybody's not supposed to catch it it's not for everybody to catch it's only for the elect and sometimes we think that if we could simplify it down a little bit or make it a little bit easier or or less complex listen I don't know how to make God less complex he is everything he he feels everything he is everything I don't know amen the message is deep I don't know how to make it shallow amen it's simple but it's deep amen it's so easy to understand there's things in it I still don't understand I don't know how to change that that's just the word of God that's the same thing with the Bible I read it's deep it's complex it goes everywhere it involves every facet of life and there's layers to scriptures that keep going deeper you get a Surface layer of the scripture you read it again and it goes deeper then you hear brother brandham saying something and he ties it to something completely different and it goes deeper yet I don't know how to change that that's the way the word of God is that's right thank you Lord amen and so I believe that what I want to do with all my heart is take the Revelation God's given me and and and preach it as clearly as I know how God amen but as clearly as I know how it's still going to be a mystery and Paul was preaching the mystery of the gospel and we're still preaching the mystery of the Gospel amen Paul now comes along and he starts taking the Bible and doing things with it that rocked the religious world he comes now and he starts to take the scripture and show them that the Seed of Abraham includes Gentiles yes do you know how unbelievable that Doctrine was yeah they these are people we you know we're standing here having the benefit of 2,000 years of church history we've known that it's obvious it's been taught since you're child you've heard the scripture over and over but if you were there in Paul's day all you've ever known is God selected a man named Abraham and he had a physical seed through Isaac and that seed lineage is the chosen of God and they're the only ones chosen of God Amen and if anybody else wants anything to do with God they've got to come here to these chosen of God who is the light to the world and if they come and and they proelite themselves among them then they can be accepted also but this is the only place yes where the election is yeah that right amen that's that's what the Jews understood now the Apostle Paul comes and says they're not all Israel that is Israel but but in the promise my seed be and and unto Isaac and now he's saying it's not the natural anymore you think it's natural you think because you can chase your lineage back and you can find Abraham back there somewhere that you're part of the elect but he says no the election isn't like that amen now the election is now not identified through a birth record but the election is identified by faith am those in the Gentiles who are able to believe the mystery of the Gospel amen have evidence that they are the Seed of Abraham because they have the faith of their father Abraham what was the faith of Abraham Abraham was able to believe what God told him for his day amen when God came and gave him a message he believed it when others doubted it he believed it when things went wrong he believed it and he became the father of Faith to the faithful amen that are the Seed of Abraham and that seed Paul tells us is not many as in seeds but singular one which is Christ so now the Seed of Abraham is Christ the anointed word amen and then the Apostle Paul comes and says now you by faith are Seed of Abraham now what does that make me that makes me part of Christ am the Jews couldn't handle this you know what they kept saying the Bible says the Bible says the Bible says the Bible says the Bible says what were they fighting Paul with the Bible the Old Testament the law and the prophets when they were disputing with Jesus they kept going back Moses said so Paul they and but Paul knew where he stood because he saw the mystery by Revelation and he kept breaking it down amen and preaching the mystery of the Gospel which now amen was showing that Messiah had come and was slain paid the price for the Redemption and now the the gospel is going to the Gentiles and he starts he starts going to all the prophecies that were in the Old Testament showing this to be true he starts preaching predestination and election different than they understood predestination and election amen they understood it by God's choice in Abraham and then God's choice in Isaac and then they were all included and Paul begins to strip that away that was known to be the truth for so long but here comes a man saying that he got a revelation of the mystery of the Bible and he begins to change everything that they held to be true he started preaching that Mount Zion was spiritual not physical he started saying that New Jerusalem is your mother and it's not the one that's on Earth but it's the one from Heaven that now counts he started preaching circumcision is the circumcision of the heart not of the outward flesh listen I mean if if we would have been good Pharisees in the day that he started saying that we would have opened the scroll and went to the scripture and showed where God told Moses to tell Israel to take every male that's born on the eighth day and have him circumcised and that's exactly Verbatim what the Bible says and there's no wiggle room we understand Hebrew yeah right but Paul now comes along and listen I'm I'm telling you if if if if if you were a common Jew in the day not an elect not a c Gene of God but just a Jew there is no way that you could take what this man is saying there's absolutely no way because what he's saying is so astronomically different than what you've believed all your life about the Bible but he's claiming to be preaching the Bible and that there was a mystery in that Bible and he's preaching the mystery out of that Bible and you don't want his mystery because you want to stay with the black Black Ink on white paper because it's what you known all of your life but Paul had the mystery of the Gospel amen it was revealed unto him and praise God we have the mystery of the Gospel been restored to us in this end time and the same thing that Paul did is the same thing that happened in brother branam it was an absolute repeat of the ministry of apostle Paul let's go to Revelation 10 together everything that they had physical Paul turned it spiritual they had a physical Israel he made it a spiritual Israel they had a physical seed he made it a spiritual seed they had a physical circumcision he made it a spiritual circumcision they had a physical Jerusalem he made it a spiritual Jerusalem amen can you see how hard it was to believe Paul's message in his day it wasn't obvious to the intellect it was only obvious to the seed of God even even Peter when Peter is trying to understand what Jesus is saying he's not comprehending what Jesus is saying and Jesus intentionally is not making it plain yeah is that right he's intentionally not making it plain he's not making it easily understood Jesus is saying things that are so Absol absolutely contrary to Common understanding and to their intellect when he says eat my flesh and drink my blood I mean there's no way they could comprehend what he was actually talking about and he was speaking spiritually they were understanding naturally and even his disciples didn't understand but there was something different down in Peter that says hey I don't know he says will you go also he says to whom will we go I I don't know and brother man said he said I don't know what you're talking about but to where else will we go but we believe and are sure that that thou art Christ the son of the Living God and thou has thou alone has the words of eternal life yeah he got that where did he get that understanding that came from inside of him that was a revelation given to him by God because he was a predestinated seed Gene of God and he was able to catch something although his intellect couldn't catch and decipher what Jesus was saying something inside of him said I have no place else to go this is the truth amen and if you ask him to explain what was true about it he couldn't even tell you what was true about the statement cuz he didn't know what was true about it all he know is this is the Son of God and he alone has the words of eternal life he got that by Revelation that came not by flesh and blood but direct Revelation from the father amen so Paul was there absolutely tearing apart what they thought was the Gospel for them and he was doing things that that technically weren't right but spiritually were correct amen oh praise God Amen that's why if if Jesus could preach the Mysteries and not reveal it because he knew there would come a time that it would be revealed Paul preached The Mystery of the gospel and he wanted to make it plain but yet he says but we preach the Mi we we we preach the gospel in Mysteries we preach the truth in Mysteries because the man's mind is darkened only those that can receive spiritual Revelation are going to understand Paul's Ministry and so when when there's a when there's a Temptation or a pressure to water down the message and just stick with maybe the simpler things and not go into the Mysteries and not go into the deep things amen my my my concern is why can't we just preach the way brother Brandon preached why can't we use the terminology he used they say why do you use this terminology why do you use these words they're hard to understand well God delivered it to us that way that's the way God brought the message and God knew that the could understand that language and he used he used a man with a seventh grade education who didn't always get his words right amen and he said brother bam said one time he says I hope you get what I'm trying to say he goes I don't have education enough to explain it but I know what I'm talking about knows what he's talking about but doesn't have education enough to explain it why would God do something like that because God's not trying to get it over to make it obvious to the intellect he's trying to get it to his children remember in Romans he made it amen Made It by faith there that it could be by grace to the to the promise so that the promise would be sure to the elect amen amen so the Temptation amen just to make it simple and don't talk about Mysteries and don't talk about all these things my goodness if that's the way God delivered the message who am I to doctor it up and fancify it and make it pretty why can't I just say what the prophet said and why is that not good enough amen I I tell you it will be good enough it is good enough because the message is here amen it is the mystery of the gospel and it's here to awaken a a group of people right and to them it's plain doesn't mean they can explain it doesn't mean they can chart it any more than Peter could all it means is to them it's plain what's plain this is the truth that's plain what else is plain in that I don't know but I know this is plain that's the truth there's so many things there's so many things brother Bram said I I still don't understand I don't know why he worded it that way I don't know why he phrased it that way I don't know why he said it but but it doesn't matter he's still the truth the message is true he's still the vessel that God sent and and I believe that he preached to us the mystery of the Gospel let's go to Revelation chap 10 now before we read Revelation chap 10 let's read Revelation 8:1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour this is the opening of the seventh seal it's a mystery because there's no symbols given all we have is silence all we know is it was opened but we don't know what happened it wasn't made plain to us we go over to Revelation 10 1:7 and brother brandham attaches Revelation 81 and Revelation 101:7 and makes them the same thing the opening of the seal in verse one says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet of pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets amen the Apostle Paul preached to us the mystery of the Gospel brother brandham was going to bring To Us by the grace of God the mystery of God in the end time we see here that that seven Thunders uttered their voices I know you know this but I just want I I feel to review it amen seven Thunders had uttered their voices and John was about to write because whatever they uttered was was intelligible he could understand what they said he heard the voice and he was able to write down what was said in that voice so he understood so the the Thunders was some sort of speech words that he could write down and when he was about to write them down a voice told him write not but seal it up amen and brother R talks about this we're going to get to this in several places he talks about it was sealed up but it was sealed up like Daniel was told that the Revelation was sealed up to the time of the end it's going to be sealed up to the time of the end but God doesn't want it to always remain sealed up to his elect but there's coming a time that he's going to unseal this portion of scripture to his elect children praise God and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished so we find that these this is what the prophet says I'm just going to read a few quotes this is the message is this the sign of the end sir this is the message he preached amen after he had the experience of spiritually getting caught up in a constellation in his bedroom there amen and seeing the the little the little doves come or the little birds and then the little doves and then the constellation of angels and it nearly packed him out of the room and and then people were coming to him for for the last couple of months bringing dreams to him he had six dreams and then he had this this vision and then he knew now because they were going to widen his road and that was a vision he had been given and they were going to tear it out and widen the road and he knew by that that it was time for him to go west so he comes and starts preaching on December 30th 1962 he preaches this message is this the sign of the answerer and he says It's On The Backs side when a book is completed not not did he say on the front side he said On The Backs side after it's all done completed then these seven Thunders voices is the only thing that stuck to the book that's not revealed it's not even written in the book this is Brother brand understanding of the seven Thunders because he sees the Seven Seals when you go to Revelation chap 6 he sees when the first one was open a a a white horse went forth and a rider went on it and he sees the symbology so he knows that it's open in symbol form he there's so there Seven Seals and there's symbols that go along with it that's in the Bible but then there's seven Thunders over here in Revelation 10 which he calls the back part of the book and there's not nothing's written about him at all all they're not even revealed and he says it's not even written in the book this is Brother brenham's understanding now we're going to see his understanding is going to change but this is his understanding and then in the first says and then there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all we just read it there and that's right and I believe that through these seven Thunders we'll be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly so the prophet of God saying we need something more than we have now and what we need is going to bring a a rapturing faith to the bride and it's going to come at the revelation of those seven seven Thunders amen which are what the unwritten portion the unrevealed he said he goes on to say in in the same message and the Seven Thunders right in the Revelation here of Jesus Christ it's some mystery does not the bible say that this is the revelation of Jesus Christ why there is some hidden Mystery then of it hm what is it the seven Thunders have it for John was just about to write and a voice came down from heaven said don't write it but seal it seal it up put it on the back side of the book it's got to be revealed it's the Mysteries so here he's saying the same thing it's not even written it's sealed up it's on the back side of the book and this is his understanding before the opening of the seals but we're going to find that at the opening of the seals his understanding changes he's saying it's something that's not written in the Bible at all he said there's not one word written about it it's some Revelation that has to be given amen then there's nothing written about it and what he's saying is true in the seven Thunders it it was it was spoke but nothing was written John was told not to write it's sealed up that's what he's calling the other set of seals those seven mysterious seals those seals on the back side of the book that's all the way he refers to it and he says not written in the Bible at all but now in 1965 we come to the Rapture message and he says now the book was written but then remember it was sealed with Seven Seals and these Seven Seals was not to be open Revelation 10 until the sounding of the last Earthly angel on Earth Revelation 10:7 see and in the days of the sounding of the last Angel's message seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished in that age that and that's the age that we're living in we all know we're living in the leoa age there will never be another age to it it can't be so we're living in the leoa age and these Seven Seals that's held that book is a mystery to people should be open at that day that's what he promised now it won't be nothing outside the word because you can't add to the word or take from the word it's got to remain always the word but the Revelation is to reveal the truth of it what it is to to make it fit with the rest of scriptures here the prophet of God just changed his understanding at first his understanding was it's not written in the Bible at all but after the seals are open he says no it's got to be written in the Bible it's got to be laying in there but it's unrevealed it's in mystery form nobody knew what it was but in the end time he's going to take the seals off of it and reveal it because you can't add one word or take one word away so it's got to be a mystery that's in the gospel it's got to already be there but in the end time there's coming another mystery that'll give us an understanding of the Bible just like the mystery that Paul had gave him an understanding of the Old Testament now there's going to be a mystery revealed that's going to unlock the New Testament and the entire Bible amen now he says in the seventh seal now you remember it was in the pyramid you remember the vision of Junior Jackson's pyramid in junior Jackson's pyramid he saw at the top of a great Hill there was a great Rock like a pyramid shame and it had writing inscribed on the outside like hieroglyphics and brother Brenham was going around with the brothers and he was interpreta interpreting the writing Amen on the outside of the Rock and when he got done he reached in the air and grabbed a sharp tool like a crowbar ripped the top of it off and inside was white granite rock and he said lights never shown on this before and he said it was it was White Rock Unwritten word Unwritten word nothing written just like like the seven Thunders now listen what he says now it was in the pyramid where the mysterious White Rock was not written on and the angels took me in the Pyramid of themselves now he's attaching that dream to getting caught up in that constellation of seven angels out in sunset Mountain he says and the angels took me into the Pyramid of themselves the mysteries of God known only to them and now they with the messengers that come to interpret that period or that message of the secret of these Seven Seals which lays with inside the pyramid inside the pyramid where on the White Rock with nothing written on it where light has there's never been a revelation of this yet because it's the seven Thunders it's the part that John was told not to write it's sealed up where is it sealed it's in the rock of Revelation it's in the word of God Amen and outside was writing everybody could read first seal White Horse second seal amen black or red horse third seal they could read that they could go on the outside and read that they could read uh about the atonement and Redemption and and salvation and blood of Jesus Christ and the Messiah they were reading all of that but they didn't know that inside this pyramid there's something that's a mystery that's been hidden in the Bible in the entire Bible has had a white unrevealed light never shined on this mystery before it was sealed who unsealed it amen that crowbar came into the hand of the Prophet Amen to take the top off why because in Sabino Canon the sword came into his hand which is the word of God and he took the word of God and opened up the mystery of the Bible so that we could see the great mystery that's been laying through the entire Bible what is it it's the mystery of the Gospel it's the mystery of the Bible it's the great mystery that was in the back part of God's mind that he held the entire time and it revealed to us the plan that God had from before the foundation of the world Amen he says then we go back to S is this is this the sign of the in sir so you notice even brother brenham's title is this the sign of the end sir why is he asking is this the sign of the end because this mystery has to be sealed until the end so he's asking is is this the sign of the end that seventh seal Amen brother bam called it the end time seal so that seven seal which is revelation 10: 1-7 can't be open till the end time and mean now he has these dreams that are given to him that he has the interpretation of he's got the the warning by Vision to go out west he gets caught up in a constellation of Angels by Vision in his room all of this is marking go back West for the revelation of the Seven Seals and he's asking is this it is this the the sign of the end sir amen and he answers his own question in this message yes it is the sign of the end because these things are sealed up until the time of the end just like he told Daniel and at the unsealing of them marks the end time it's over for the Gentiles now back again and is this a sign of the insert you notice the writing was on the Rocks I was interpreting it for them they were elated that's the mystery of God that's been not understood for years could that be that and then notice in some mysterious way we picked up out of the air a sharp tool that opened up the top and in there was white granite but it wasn't interpreted there was no letters I didn't interpret that Junior I just looked at it and said to the Brethren look on this listen so he's interpreting the dream right here in the pool pit the the pyramid the opening the top the White Rock and he says I told the brothers look on this stay here and look on this and he went out west because he's preaching now Serv as as a sign he's letting us know that there's a mystery to be revealed in the seven thunders in the Bible and he's saying look on this and he's telling the whole church I'm going out west God's led me out west I'm going out west you all remain here and listen what he says he says I didn't interpret that Junior I just looked at it and said said to the Brethren look on this and that's fulfilled tonight amen that dream was fulfilled and S is this the sign of the end or is this the sign of the end s that he told them you look on this there's a there's there's there's something the lights never shine on you look on this I'm going out west he says and listen what he says and while they were studying that I slipped towards the West what for maybe to understand the interpretation of what's written in the top of this could it be I told you he answers his own question in here absolutely this is what he's going out west for and those blasting the other morning That Shook Me Plum till I raised up in the air now he's talking about getting caught up in the constellation in Sabino Canyon till I raised up in the air as high as this building that constellation of angels seven angels in the form of a pyramid is that them Thunders that's coming forth could it be I'm sorry yeah he's talking this is not talking about saino can is talking about in his room the vision he just had a week earlier is that them Thunders that's coming forth could it be whenever he says could it be just say yes because now we know the rest of the story could it be yes could it be that I'm going out to get the interpretation yes could it be that these seven th yes is this the sign of the end sir yes it is the sign of the end we are in the end time amen we're at the end of the Gentile dispensation Church ages has ended we are here amen he said this is all interpreted according to his dream it was all finished according to God's word the seventh Messenger will finish seventh message will be finished and then the seven Thunders praise God let's go to Colossians chapter 4 I don't care how many times I review this it Thrills my soul amen why cuz what brother Bam's doing is he's coming in here to the Bible amen and God Amen brought him up into that pyramid the constellation of angels Amen to the Revelation known only to them to what to the place the lights never shined before to the Granite White Rock what is what is a right Rock it's a word it's a revelation of the word amen but nothing's written on it it's a mystery it's a secret and it's inside the word and brother B's not saying it's outside the word anymore now he knows it's in the word it's just been missed for all these Generations the church ages missed it amen but it's not going to be missed anymore because God bought a prophet just like the Apostle Paul who's preaching to us the mystery of the Gospel amen can go back and pull it all out Colossians chapter 4 verse three he says with all praying also for us that God will open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds Paul was preaching the mystery of Christ let's go to Colossians chapter 1 this one's super familiar to us this comes out of brother benham's opening context in Colossians 1 he reads from 15 all the way down to 29 when he preaches Christ is the mystery of God revealed but I'd like to pick it up just at verse 25 whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory this was the mystery that Paul was beginning to preach and this mystery remained a mystery through the church ages but in the end time at the opening of The Seven Seals he came back to show us what was inside the book amen there's so many things that I I want to share on that brother brandham said that this Bible is the Book of Life right he called it the book of life he called it a book of redemption he called the book in the hand of him that sth on the throne in Revelations 4 he called that the Book of Life right he called that our marriage certificate they asked him what you ask him what was in that book in his hand and it was names what kind of names names of the elect amen and he said now he's calling names but he's not calling names like reading off a list he's not calling names like John Doe and and he's not doing that but he's revealing the Mysteries as he's calling those names amen because if your name is in that book then you're in this book and then he tells us and what is the Believers they're the words in the book amen and so what is the book it's the record of Christ it's the marriage certificate it's the book of life it's the book of redemption it's all the same thing so that book that was in the hand of him that sth on the throne that book was sealed and to be open amen and that opened the book of life it opened uh the book of redemption it opened the marriage certificate it opened the the record of the family of God it opened all of those things it opened that and when it opened that it also opened this amen and then when it opened this then you could see yourself in the word now now you could see I'm part of this we're not looking down to try to find our name like Chad Lamb I'm trying to find my ident identification who I really am in the word and I couldn't do it amen just in the church age Doctrine anymore cuz we come to the time for the revealing of the Mysteries and now he come and he pulled apart now the he he's trying to do away with all the guess work and reading this and saying I think I am maybe I'm saved I put my faith in Christ but then I made a mistake the other day and now there's Calvinism now there's Armenian ISM and them I always saved or did I make a mistake and now there's always an identity crisis down through the church ages but he cometh the end of time to peel the seals away so that he could come back and show us the mystery that is in this Bible and the Mystery is not you hopefully will be saved the mystery is not if you're a good boy you'll be saved but the mystery is you were part of God from before the foundation of the world that's the White Rock that's on the inside it's the mystery of God himself as he decided to portion himself out over time to reveal his great mystery of himself and pull it back together at the end time so that he could pull everything together in Christ that which is in heaven and in Earth all in him amen this isn't about being deep this isn't about being revelated this is about your identification it's about looking in the mirror of God's word and saying mama that's me that's me I was part of God I come from God I'm going back to God I'm not afraid of not making the rater I'm not afraid of falling apart I'm Not Afraid why because he's revealed to me my part in the book when the book was sealed I was sealed in the book when the book was unsealed my identity was unsealed to take away fear and scare and all these tactics of the devil amen is it simple is it plain to you oh my goodness we can go into all kinds of details that'll make your head spin and my head spin amen there's so many details why it's the revelation of Jesus Christ how you going to put it how you going to boil it down to three words he's all and in all you could talk about it forever he's going to be unfolding himself throughout eternity we can talk about it from every angle you want to talk about it we can use all kinds of language and words we can never come to the end of it but when you boil it all down it keeps coming back to the same Revelation that you are part of God you were with him before the foundation of the world you were in his mind that mystery that he had in the back part of his mind included you as an individual and he come to the end time to take the seals off so that you could see who you really are amen praise God is it simple Yes is it complex yes is it easy to understand yes is it deep Beyond understanding yes amen prise Lord that's right praise God I love it I love it on the surface I love it in in the depths I love it in the Mysteries I love the part I understand I love the part I don't understand I love realizing I thought I understood and still didn't understand when somebody else I like that too I want God to be unsearchable I want it to be the unsearchable riches of Christ I don't want to come to the end of Revelation I don't want to bump into it and say well that's it that's all we're going to get God's not going to reveal himself anymore I want a god whose resources never run out I want a god who's beyond my understanding I want a God that I can't boil down and put in my bottle and control in any way I want a God that's bigger than anything I've ever comprehended far beyond my understanding I want a God that wants to be searched and found and wants to unveil himself to his children I want a god who's new every day I want a god who's constantly revealing himself to me I want him deep I want him wide I want him shallow I want him on the surface I want him in the depths I want him in the cracks I want him in the crevices I want him in plain sight I want him everywhere that's what this Revel is it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and what is Jesus Christ the word what is the word the very thought of God being expressed he is the anointed word for our day which is fullness not partiality amen we could preach this for 300 years and we're never going to come to the end of the message cuz it unlocked the mystery of God it finished the mystery of God and unlocked the the revelation of Jesus Christ amen and brother Brenham comes along and he starts preaching things that blow the mind of the ecclesiastical world what brother brandham did was the same thing Paul did amen he says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see when you will understand clearly then you see on I believe what is being done God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son of man himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret what's a secret a mystery and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour what's that that's revelation 81 the opening of the seventh seal which brother Branham connected to Revelation 101:7 and made them the same events okay therefore the entire Bible oh my yeah let me pick up this sentence again and then I'll get to this and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and even and listen and seven Thunders uttered their voices there was silence in heaven and seven Thunders uttered their voices now listen what he says next and John was forent to write it see the coming of the lord it's a mystery it's a secret that he wants to make plain to his children see when brother Brenham comes to Christ's mystery of God revealed he preaches this in July 28th in 1963 but he preaches the seals in March of 1963 and when he comes to the seventh seal when brother B comes to the seventh seal he spends a lot of time reviewing the previous seals he goes into to the six seal quite a bit and reviews it and talks about Revelation chapter 7 and he and he's doing like a lot of review and he's looking back and and if if you're like me you I've given you my testimony on that before you're like me you're anticipating the seven seal now right because we got the first six we know what a white horse rider is now I got that that I know that that's Antichrist spirit and then I know what Beast went out to anoint it and I know Souls on the Altar and now tribulation we know all that and then he comes to the seventh seal and he's really reviewing the Sixth Seal and he's going into Revelation chapter 7 these two groups of people and the interum and now he's coming up to the seventh seal and he gets ready to start explaining the seventh seal and he says a sentence or two and he says I feel to stop right there I feel a stop right there why it's a mystery he was told that he can't explain it he explained the first two and he got in trouble with the angel but he was told not to explain this third one so so he can't tell you what it is he can't explain it to you so when he says I feel to stop go no further right here in my notes I wrote stop go no further then he starts to say but remember the vision I told you many years ago remember the baby you remember the tent and he said this will be your third pool and the other day in Sabino Canyon and that sword struck my hand and that voice said this is your third pole what's he doing at first the first time I listened to this I'm like what is he talking about just tell me what the seven seal is would you just tell me just like you said White Horse is this and it means that why didn't you do this with the seven seal and so we're going through this and what he's doing is he's told by the angel don't explain it so what's he doing he's coming just like Jesus and he's showing by Parables remember the vision I told I feel to stop say no more remember the vision that I told you what's he doing he's telling you what the seven seal is without telling you what the seven seal is amen why because this is not for carnal impersonations this is not for anybody to pick up this is only for the elect amen and he goes through and he starts talking in Parables and he starts tying Parables and dreams and Visions together and he explains a few things amen then he stops then he comes a few months later and he comes and preaches Christ is the mystery of God revealed and in Christ The Mystery of God revealed to my opinion based off what he's saying he starts to bring the revelation of the seventh seal because he says it's silence for half an hour and seven Thunders uttered their voice and John was forbidden to write it see no one knows what it is see the coming of the Lord now he's starting to tie it all together and show us what the opening of The Seven seal really is amen he says and that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't know oh there's so many things I want to say brother B standing here getting ready to preach Christ is the mystery of God revealed and what is the opening of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be revealed in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins the sound the mystery of God shall be revealed the opening of the seventh seal and here he comes with a title that says Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's Christ it's the coming of Christ it's the coming of the Lord and it is the mystery of God revealed and then he tells us that it's the coming of the Lord and he says that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet my I love God yes you read that and say that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't nope you say well Seven Seals not revealed he just said he hasn't revealed it yet that amen then you go to the next paragraph he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ which is the seventh seal because Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen amen so now he says he has showed it or revealed in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ H the ENT entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in Tye and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in the last day he has revealed it and shows it and God said well you'll see it right here this morning yes wait a second he hasn't revealed it yet it's a good thing he doesn't know but you'll see it right here this morning it's not revealed How will I see it because he's not going to explain it he's just going to preach it and God's going to bring the Revelation amen oh and with God's help well I I love that and with God's help you'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it he says Christ's mystery God revealed for the text I want to take here this for a text basing it upon the entire Bible but I want us to title this Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ being the mystery of God revealed don't think of that title and put it far away amen because Christ is the anointed word and remember Abraham's seed was Christ and by by faith you're what Abraham's seed amen so that makes you part of Christ because if he was the word she has to be the word also and he is the fullness of the word and she has part in that so Christ the the the manifested anointed word is the mystery of God revealed and you and I have a part in that Revelation amen when he comes the souls that are in prison now just want to read a couple more so but one day he rose from there and came forth where there was a book at where was the book at it was still in the abstract owner God Almighty and John looked around and wept because there was no one no man even worthy to look on the book and especially open the seals to reveal what the hidden Mystery was the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals when those Seven Seals was opened that opened up the entire Bible the Seven Seals it was sealed with seven Mysteries and in those Seven Seals held the entire mystery of it and it was the book of redemption New Testament praise God this is the the next quote I want to read this day this scripture is fulfilled this is from February of 1965 he said the Seven Seals of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible will be opened and fulfill Revelation 10 that in the seven seventh Angel's message these things should come to pass this day this scripture is fulfilled before your eyes this day this scripture is fulfilled praise be to God this was 1965 and he's telling us amen the Seven Seals of the hidden Mystery the entire Bible will be opened and fulfill Revelations 10 in the that in the seventh Angels message these things should come to pass this day this script he's letting you know Revelations 10 1-7 is fulfilled what does it mean is this the sign of the Ender yes is this the end time yes is Gentile dispensations over yes amen is it the marking of the end of everything what is the seven seal It's The End Time seal when it goes forth it marks the end of everything but it goes out in Cycles one thing goes out and birth end of denominations and then another thing ends then another thing ends all the way till even time itself ends this is the end time seal the wrapping up conclusion finishing of everything that God's been wanting to do amen and it's been written in the White Rock on the inside of the pyramid that you can't add one word or take one word away you can't have you can't come up with something that's not in the Bible what you have to do is you have to get the Revelation and the Revelation must dovetail with the word of God why because it was laying in there in mystery form this is why brother bam says you've got to read between the lines why because there's a mystery laying the White Rock the unwritten portion amen where is it it's veiled it's veiled behind the the types and the shadows and the characters of The Bible they've all been revealing it but in time but now in the end time he's taken the veil away so that we can go back and we can read the book of Esther and say mama that's me we can read Ruth and say mama that's me we can read through all these these books of the Bible and say my I can't believe I've missed this all my life I can't believe we've been missing all of these great truths why he pulled back the seals to reveal the mystery that was contained in the Bible and that mystery brother baham comes and Christ is the mystery of God revealed and says it was revealed in a three-fold manner one purpose one goal one thing God wanted to accomplish this was the mystery veiled in the back part of his mind that nobody Through the Bible knew they took parts of in pieces and had bits of Revelation but nobody could compile the whole Revelation and put it together why it was sealed under those seven Thunders but in the end time God would have amen the seventh angel here on Earth in the leot dean Church age and he would get caught up into a constellation of angels come back for the revelation of the Seven Seals amen so that he could take the veil off of the word so he could come then later and preach Christ as the mystery of God revealed so that we would see it's me Colossians 1 2527 that's me the great mystery that he had in his mind is that he was going to reveal himself through people that's right yes sir that he was going to come and reveal himself in what the Lamb's Book of Life what is it people yes this Bible is the record of human beings from the beginning to the end every story is about people all the characters are people all the prophets are people it's people from beginning to end it's the book of life it's the family of God it's the record of Christ and guess what I found my identity in this book not more confusion not am I could I be I might be I hope I am but at the opening of The Seven Seals All the mystery and scare has been taken away I am part of this revelation yes brother B he comes and he he takes things that we took for granted and he comes and he he takes the gospel and he preaches the mystery of the Gospel he comes and he shows us so many things that I I I don't have time to get into them all neither do I I I even prepare to get into many of them but he starts teaching things that we took for granted and like what salvation is and what the blood is for and what Redemption is and and what does it mean to be redeemed and and and you know we had an idea through the through the denominational world that being redeemed means that I was I was in a junk pile amen and he come to a junk pile and he come and pulled me out and he and he paid for me and he redeemed me but brother brandham comes at at the at the revelation of God's mystery and he comes and he takes us deeper because he preaches the mystery behind the gospel and he says you can't redeem what wasn't yours to begin with the reason that we're redeemed is because we were with God before the foundation of the world as an attribute of God and now we're redeemable because we were with him before it's not God feeling sorry for certain individuals and you're a poor one and and if you'll just be nice and obey me and believe in me I will I will redeem you that's not what Redemption is Redemption is the little lost lamb that was with the shepherd before has separated from the flock and in the darkness of the world and the Shepherds coming down to find the lamb to what restore the lamb back to the shepherd to redeem it back and now Calvary was not about God feeling sorry for a bunch of people and hoping that somebody would accept his pardoning grace amen there's going to be a group amen that will get a pardon because of what they did with the word they had but that's not Calvary came for Redemption Calvary came for the elect seed he came down and paid the price for the Earth because he had himself swn into the Earth in a lost condition so he came himself to pay the price of blood for Redemption brother brandham took Redemption and took it to the depths of God and took it back to the mind of God Amen now there's no more uh you know there's no more you know brother B even talked about don't even like those prayers where he say don't you want to see Grandma someday and don't you want to do this and and won't you accept poor Jesus died for you won't you accept what he did for you my Jesus died amen for Redemption to redeem back amen the portion of God that God had portion redem brother B says only the elect is considered in Redemption only the elect is considered in Redemption and all of a sudden are the Armenian Believers their minds just go po amen because they cannot understand why because he knows the mystery of God he's been behind the veil amen the mystery's taken off the book and he now understands there's been one goal one God wanted to achieve and he's done it in a three-fold manner and that is to get preeminence in a man he did that in Jesus to get preeminence in a people he's doing that now in you and I to restore him back to Eden so God can manifest himself brother takes all these doctrines takes these doctrines and he begins to preach the mystery of the gospel and people can't take it they can't take it because brother R said even some ministers will misunderstand because they've been taught to believe scripture in a certain way right amen same thing reason that they didn't believe the Apostle Paul is the same reason they didn't believe brother Brandon yeah right because it wasn't intellectually obvious they had been studying the Bible and reading the verses and reading the scriptures and they had an understanding but brother Brenham comes because his understanding by the opening of the seals is so much greater than the understanding they had previously amen now the mystery is peeled back now we know why Christ came why we know how to what about why it had to be a virgin birth yeah why it had to be a blood atonement amen and all goes back to the serpent seat in the fall in the garden that's right amen all of these things what is it it's the mystery of the gospel and that's what's been handed to us the mystery of the Gospel there's so many things I would love to take those things one by one those doctrines and to take what we commonly understood and then what brother bham does with it it's absolutely mesmerizing amen what he does with justification blood atonement salvation predestination adoption amen all of these things they go so deep friends it reveals the very Mind Of God Amen but I want to finish with just a few quotes out of the message Paradox brother Bram says he said so there was Joshua representing Grace was right along with law but could not be enforced as long as law was in the proper place and so has the church World in this last day is coming along it's played its part but there's coming a time where it must cease it must do it there's got to be an Ephesians also of this journey just as there was of other Journeys there's there has to come an Ephesians and Ephesus an Ephesians of this journey and brother Bram said that it was really uh uh amazing to me I've been looking at this and meditating on it for a while Amen brother B preached a message called Joshua uh Joshua types Ephesians and Joshua is a book of placing it's a book of coming out an exodus and coming to a promised land and being placed in that land and Joshua was the agent that God would use and he would bring them across Jordan in a miraculous way after a a a a a journey amen through the Wilderness Journey where they saw failure and they saw mistake and they saw all kinds of things amen now they're coming across Jordan into a place of separation and now they're coming into the promised land and the entering here is pure grace pure grace they didn't earn it they didn't work for it they didn't pay for it this is God's land and God said I'm giving you this land it's absolute election and absolute Grace it's predestination election and Grace they had nothing to do with it Abraham didn't pay money for God says I'm giving you this land amen then they got into all kinds of chaos and and they had all kinds of issues happen and they find themselves in slavery down in Egypt and they're in Egypt for 400 years and afterwards God raises up Moses to come and bring them out this is all election this is all Grace this is all Mercy amen and they come across by pure grace and election he says I'm giving you this land it's yours go and possess it you get to go here this tribe goes here this tribe here this family here what's Joshua doing he's placing the church you're here and you're here you're here you're here it it it's a placing it's an adoption they're coming into the land and and it's all by Grace Moses was law but Joshua brother B said was Grace he represented the grace of God why because it's placing now he says Joshua uh types or Parallels Ephesians so now he says there's got to be an Ephesians at the end of The Journey there's got to be in Ephesians there's another quote here in Paradox where he says but we're promised according to Revelation 10 and according to Malachi 4 and St Luke 22:17 and so forth there has got to come an Ephesians to this there is promised it friends so what does he called the Ephesians Revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 22:17 what is it it's the coming of the message yeah it's the coming of the of the secret revealed the mysteries of the seven Thunders the Seven Seals being opened the great mystery of God now has to come what to be our Ephesians what is our Ephesians I chose you you didn't choose me remember how Ephesians chapter 1 starts we've been reading it when we've been talking about the mystery of his will amen according to the good pleasure of his will he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world Amen when he chose us before the foundation of the world what did we have to do with it nothing he did the choosing according to the good pleasure of his will this is our Ephesians coming at the end time at the opening of the seals we realize I didn't do anything the only thing I could have done was ruin this it's what he did before the foundation of the world when he chose me in Christ and chose me unto adoption he chose me for an Ephesians age right amen what was Ephesians Ephesians was the first church age this is where the Apostle Paul amen was bringing them out of judaa ISM and he was bringing the Gentiles out of heathenism and he was bringing them into the New Testament Church and Ephesians starts off with what Grace pure absolute Grace you are this by his choice you're chosen adoption by his choice you were chosen in Christ Jesus by his good pleasure you've been accepted in the Beloved because he wanted to that was Ephesians amen but they fell from their Ephesians just like Israel fell from their Crossing from their taking the land but he said there's got to come in Ephesians in the end time and it's going to take the opening of the word to bring us back to Ephesians here's I would like to read that again because I didn't finish the quote I got a little too excited so we're promised according to Revelation 10 according to Malachi 4 and St Luke 22:17 and so forth that there is got to come in Ephesians to this this is promised it friends there must come in Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God must be unfolded what brings Ephesians the unfolding of the mystery of the Bible that brings us into our Ephesians and it's in the leoty and age that this takes place further down in Paradox he says now you cannot add nothing to the book or take anything from it Revelation 22:18 says who will Who willever will add one word or take one word is part will be taken from the book of life now we cannot add or take so therefore we know that Luther could not get to it Wesley and so forth the reformers knocked finny Calvin on down so forth they didn't get it all but what they had was the Gospel truth you believe that amen they couldn't get it all but what they had was the Gospel truth but what we have is the mystery of the Gospel amen they had the gospel truth all down Through the Ages but what we have is the mystery of the Gospel amen and now now in the last days we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because it'll come an Ephesians age to it and we're here what is the Ephesians age Paul the Apostle Paul placing the church what was Joshua Joshua placing the church what is the opening of the seventh seal supposed to do bring us to adoption place the church where is it placing us it's placing Us in the word amen this is you and this is your territory and this is who you are this is what you fulfill and this is the portion of scripture he's placing us Amen in the word an exodus out of denominations and church systems an exodus out of these things and being put back into the word that is our Ephesians now in Joshua this is this is why this is so critical in Joshua Joshua comes and by like I said pure grace and election he places them in the land and then after he places them in the land now he says now it's your job to possess this land amen it's your job to cultivate it Farm it raise crops worship God keep it clean keep it pure raise your children worship God come to the temple three times I mean now it it's it's pure Grace it's pure grace and election that brings you into the land but now it's your responsibility to possess the land and live in it according to God and Shine the Light and be the word of God made flesh in the land and now according to Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 there's to be an Ephesians age again where we're taken out in a Third Exodus and brought back to a placing of the church and where is he placing the bride he's placing us in Christ the revealed word and then what does he say now live it now manifest it now possess the word now possess it and stay with it and manifest it and keep the keep keep the wild beast away and cultivate it and grow it and amen stay in the land and Shine the Light and be the nation set on a hill be the word of God made flesh amen there's coming a Fe iians once again friends and what did he do first he opened the seals why was that so important yes because if we're still wondering what the plan of God is and who we are and if I'm included and what's going to happen and and who's in and who's out and which one's right we never go and possess the land so first he had to come and clean up all the misunderstanding so that we could properly know who we are and what God wants to do then could place Us in the word and then leave us by the spirit of God to possess the land yes oh God help us to possess this land help us to have eyes open Hey listen it's not laws it's not dos and don't it's not a have to amen when God said this is your land they were so excited to March into that land they were so excited to set up a home they were so excited to be cultivating and growing and exploring amen and when this word was restored he said live the word amen it wasn't like he was saying if you don't I'll cut you off he already took care of that for us amen he's not going he's not going to lose one but this is the age we're not going to fall like first Ephesians fell she's predestinated not to the veil's been taken so she can step back in to her position and finish what the first church didn't finish to live this word to manifest it to display Jesus Christ in a many membered body that's what we're here for and that's what the seals unveiled to you and I amen our position our portion and our placing and our responsibility praise God let's all stand amen musicians if you'll come brother Ben if you'll come friends there's a gospel give your heart to the Lord surrender to his word come to church live the word that there's a gospel but the power comes in the mystery of the Gospel amen who we are why why Redemption by Blood why election why predestination why a prophet why the opening of the word why the real power to live comes in the unveiling of the Seven Seals taking away the mystery of who the bride really is and bringing us into the picture I say oh thank God all of those children of Israel who crossed that Jordan and took their land they knew it wasn't for another age yeah they knew it was for them they crossed on dry land they got the portion they felt the dirt amen they knew it wasn't for another age this isn't they knew it was for them say oh God help me cross this Jordan of denominationalism and Gentile dispensation and move into Separation by your grace amen and come in here to know that this is for me this is my position this is my place amen I'm so thankful for the mystery of the gospel that was boldly proclaimed in this end time and I thank God he had a mouthpiece here to proclaim the mystery of the gospel for me amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus I'm so thankful Lord for your word God I'm so thankful to be standing at the end of time God there was men your children your elect seed that come up in every generation and every dispensation and God it each one was so thrilled with the revelation of the word for their hour they were thrilled with the teaching of true justif justification they were thrilled with sanctification they were thrilled with the restoration of the gifts and it was their portion their meat their life but oh God how blessed are we to be standing at the very end of time when the veil has been taken off the entire word god when you revealed Lord yourself and your Eternal purpose your plan that you had from before the foundation of the world oh God thank you for allowing us to come now thank you for sending a prophet in our age thank you for the Bold proclamation of this message Lord for God you've given us ears to hear and a heart to perceive by your grace and Lord we recognize it's pure unadulterated Grace it's pure predestination and election and we're so thankful you've given us the land you've taken us over now God help us to possess this land to live in it to grow to manifest you I love you Lord I Thank you for this privilege God all that we say and do I pray God you would just magnify into the hearts of your children all that we're trying Lord to do God human efforts fail constantly we can't speak right we can't explain ourselves right we can't articulate what's so deep in our hearts but God I pray you'd come and you'd bring Revelation in the way that only you can that you would Quicken it to each heart to each one of your children and and may they be able to look in the word after it's been unveiled and say mama that's me that belongs to me that's who I am God may you give us each one courage to keep pressing forward to possess this great land you put us in to magnify your word and manifest it in our lives may we manifest it in our families and our homes our
