[0:00] we go back for years we would read John
[0:02] 1:1 in the beginning was the word and
[0:05] the Word was with God and the Word was
[0:06] God we say oh that's Jesus Christ right
[0:08] there but brother bandham tells us
[0:10] you're right there amen he said you know
[0:13] he says You must find yourself in
[0:14] scripture amen if you are a child of God
[0:18] an attribute of God part of the word
[0:20] when it says in the beginning was the
[0:22] word you are included in that scripture
[0:25] now we could be wrong we could be
[0:27] self-deceived we could have the wrong
[0:28] idea we could claim to be something
[0:30] we're not but there is a reality on this
[0:32] earth now there are those attributes
[0:35] living in flesh that were part of the
[0:37] mind of God before the foundation of the
[0:39] world Amen I believe it by faith I could
[0:41] be completely deceived but I don't have
[0:43] any way to prove it the only way that I
[0:45] can prove it to myself is that I believe
[0:47] it from the bottom of my toes to the top
[0:49] of my head I believe it unreasonably I
[0:51] believe it
[0:54] ridiculously but I can't prove it
[0:56] neither can you prove it we may all in
[0:58] this room be sitting and it may be wrong
[1:00] we may not be who we think we are but it
[1:02] doesn't change the fact that it's still
[1:05] true it's still the absolute truth that
[1:08] God's desire was to manifest himself in
[1:10] flesh and he's been portioning out his
[1:12] attributes All Through Time and those
[1:14] attributes would come into manifestation
[1:16] which were his thoughts expressing
[1:18] something of his nature something of his
[1:20] plan and he was expressing it all down
[1:22] through time and every time they
[1:24] expressed it that was Christ the
[1:26] anointed word that was God moving
[1:28] through his word to express him self
[1:30] from cover to cover it was Jesus Christ
[1:32] and where did we find it we found it in
[1:37] people all the way down
[1:40] through and we have no problem saying
[1:43] yeah Paul's one of them and Peter's one
[1:45] of them and David's got to be included
[1:46] and this one's got to be included amen
[1:49] that's fine and that's wonderful but
[1:50] that doesn't do me any good you know
[1:52] what gives me Faith you know what helps
[1:54] me overcome you know what helps me bring
[1:56] this guy into submission is when I
[1:58] realized it wasn't just David and it it
[2:00] wasn't just Paul and it wasn't just
[2:01] Peter but it's me
[2:03] too and now because it's me it matters
[2:06] how I live it matters how I talk it
[2:08] matters what I see it matters where I go
[2:10] cuz I was not here to have pleasure I've
[2:13] not been put here to live my life I've
[2:15] been put here to manifest Jesus Christ
[2:17] the word anointed word for this
[2:20] age and I may only have one little tiny
[2:23] expression but I want to express that
[2:25] tiny expression because that tiny
[2:27] expression is part of God God it is the
[2:30] thought of God from before the
[2:32] foundation of the world that he wants to
[2:34] express through a physical body on this
[2:36] Earth in this
[2:41] day you see this is why the message came
[2:44] to break away denomination to break away
[2:46] Church holds to break away confusion
[2:49] amen because we were trying to serve God
[2:51] by a system we try to serve God by an
[2:53] order we tried to serve God but we
[2:55] didn't realize we weren't going to
[2:56] please God by keeping an order we're not
[2:58] going to please God by agreeing with a
[3:00] tenant or agreeing with a Doctrine we're
[3:02] only going to please God when he has
[3:04] full sway in our life and can manifest
[3:06] what was in his mind through our flesh
[3:09] from before the foundation of the
[3:11] world that's what God's looking for amen
