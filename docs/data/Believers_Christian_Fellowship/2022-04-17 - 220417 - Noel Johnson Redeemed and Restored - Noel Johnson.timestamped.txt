[11:27] [Music]
[11:41] let's just pray
[11:44] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[11:46] father
[11:48] we've gathered ourselves together this
[11:50] morning lord to worship you
[11:53] we honor the resurrection
[11:55] brother adam says we do that every
[11:57] sunday
[11:59] but lord today is a special day in the
[12:01] christian
[12:02] world
[12:03] when lord
[12:04] they pause to acknowledge that yeah you
[12:07] did rise
[12:09] but yet lord they don't have the
[12:10] understanding of what the resurrection
[12:12] means
[12:14] but lord you sent a prophet to us in
[12:16] this generation that we could fully
[12:18] understand
[12:20] that when you rose from the dead
[12:22] lord it has a special significance for
[12:25] your bride
[12:27] take me lord as your instrument this
[12:28] morning and use me
[12:30] tell me to relax in you and
[12:32] i'm asking you lord to take control of
[12:34] my thoughts and my mind
[12:37] the lord the things that are said
[12:38] wouldn't be my thoughts but lord they'd
[12:40] be yours
[12:41] and the words that are spoken lord they
[12:43] would come from you
[12:45] bless us lord with your presence
[12:48] and bless us through your word
[12:50] for i ask it in jesus most precious name
[12:54] amen
[12:57] while you're standing if you'd open up
[12:58] unto leviticus the 25th chapter
[13:01] and we'll read verses 47 down to 49.
[13:07] the thought this morning if i could put
[13:09] it that way it's we have been redeemed
[13:12] and we have been restored
[13:16] in leviticus it says
[13:19] and if a sojourner or a stranger wax
[13:22] rich by thee
[13:23] and their brother that dwelleth by him
[13:25] wax poor and shall sell himself into the
[13:27] stranger or sojourner by thee
[13:29] or to the sock of the stranger's family
[13:32] after that he is sold he may be redeemed
[13:34] again one of his brethren may redeem him
[13:37] either his uncle his uncle's son may
[13:39] redeem him or any that is nigh of kin
[13:41] unto him of his family may redeem him
[13:45] or if he be able he may redeem himself
[13:48] you can be seated
[13:52] in christianity today the christian
[13:54] world anyway they celebrate the
[13:57] resurrection
[13:59] but yet they take in in the what's going
[14:02] on within the christian world they have
[14:04] easter eggs and easter bunnies they have
[14:06] all kinds of paganism
[14:09] but this is the time of the year also
[14:11] that the jewish people celebrate the
[14:13] passover
[14:15] because it's in the passover they go
[14:17] back into their history and they begin
[14:19] to look at what happened to them when
[14:21] they were delivered from egypt
[14:23] and when we begin to understand what
[14:25] jesus christ did at the cross
[14:28] he redeemed us and he delivered us from
[14:30] sin he delivered us from the power of in
[14:33] the bondage of satan
[14:35] he came to set us free
[14:38] where we no longer have to be a slave to
[14:40] sin we no longer have to be a slave to
[14:42] sickness we no longer have to be a slave
[14:44] to satan
[14:45] but he set us free
[14:48] and that is the significance if you will
[14:50] of the resurrection
[14:51] because when he rose brother branham
[14:53] says we rose with him
[14:55] when he rose he proved who he was when
[14:58] he rose all of a sudden all of the
[15:00] promises that had been made all the
[15:02] promises of the scripture
[15:04] now has been open to us
[15:06] it isn't supposed to be a struggle with
[15:08] us it's not supposed to be we're
[15:10] striving for this or striving for that
[15:13] but when we begin to fully comprehend
[15:15] calvary and what calvary has
[15:16] accomplished for us
[15:18] it makes it so really we should be able
[15:20] to come in our christian life we should
[15:22] be able to rest in him
[15:24] realizing it's not about us and what we
[15:26] do but it's about him and what he has
[15:28] done for us
[15:30] because like i say this is christianity
[15:32] this this is the significance of calvary
[15:36] god we cannot save ourselves that like
[15:38] it talks about there in leviticus a
[15:40] person he was taken he was sold into and
[15:42] he sold himself into slavery
[15:45] he waxed poor
[15:47] and so and and when we were born into
[15:49] this world we we were sold into slavery
[15:51] we were sold into slavery because of our
[15:53] natural birth
[15:55] but somebody was able to come along in
[15:57] leviticus it says the near kin can come
[15:59] along to him and they can take him
[16:01] and they can restore him
[16:04] they can redeem him they can they can
[16:05] make him so no longer is he bound to the
[16:07] taskmaster that he had sold himself to
[16:10] no longer is he under the under the
[16:12] obligation to obey that taskmaster but
[16:15] he's able to take and he's able to take
[16:17] him and he's able to go back and he'd be
[16:19] able to be free and he can go back to
[16:21] the land that that his forefathers had
[16:23] had and he's able to go back and in
[16:25] freedom and and he can rejoice in the
[16:27] fact that all of a sudden now
[16:30] he's no longer a slave
[16:32] but see too often we think we're slaves
[16:35] too often we look at ourselves and our
[16:37] flesh and our flesh has its limitations
[16:40] but too often satan keeps coming along
[16:42] and says no you are my slave
[16:45] you must obey what i command you to do
[16:47] you must sit there and i will i will put
[16:49] a sickness on you i will i will cause
[16:51] problems in your life and and i will
[16:53] make you my slave
[16:55] i will dictate to you the life that you
[16:57] will live i will dictate to you the the
[17:00] problems that you're going to have i'm
[17:01] gonna i am going to control you
[17:04] and so often that's what we live under
[17:07] we live under this fact that we believe
[17:09] satan still controls us we live under
[17:11] the fact that we have to listen to him
[17:13] but really we don't
[17:16] calvary set us free
[17:18] that is the significance of calvary that
[17:21] is the significance of the resurrection
[17:23] and this is the subject if we will in
[17:25] this morning
[17:27] the bible says in galatians the third
[17:29] chapter it says but the scripture has
[17:31] concluded all under sin that the promise
[17:33] by faith of jesus christ may be given to
[17:36] them that believe
[17:38] when we go and we begin to understand
[17:40] god's plan and purpose of plan of
[17:42] redemption
[17:43] he had to make it so that he so that
[17:45] anybody would be able to be able to
[17:47] accept the salvation which god is
[17:49] offering to them
[17:51] if it had been based upon works
[17:53] it would leave a lot of us out
[17:55] it was based upon genealogy it would
[17:58] leave a whole bunch of people out
[18:00] so what he did was he said that he he
[18:02] leveled the playing field he made it so
[18:04] that everyone that comes into this world
[18:07] you're born in sin you're shaped in
[18:08] iniquity you come to the world speaking
[18:10] lies and you're all under the dominion
[18:12] of satan you're all under the bondage of
[18:14] him
[18:15] but he says it comes he says we were so
[18:17] we were all under sin that that the
[18:19] level of the playing field
[18:21] but the promise by the faith of jesus
[18:23] christ he says that is what sets us free
[18:26] and who gives us the faith
[18:29] jesus christ gave you that faith
[18:32] why did you accept him as your savior
[18:34] why have you accepted this message
[18:37] because god has given you the faith to
[18:39] be able to accept this
[18:41] i look at the people
[18:42] that i used to grow up with
[18:44] why did i accept jesus christ
[18:47] why did not to punish the people in my
[18:49] in the classmates why not why didn't
[18:51] they not accept it
[18:52] i look around and and within the message
[18:56] lord why have you kept me in this
[18:58] message
[18:59] because there's a lot of things that
[19:00] have come along all the false doctrines
[19:02] and all the false teachings and all the
[19:04] things which go with it
[19:06] why have you enabled me to remain steady
[19:09] why have you been able to keep me in the
[19:11] center of the line
[19:13] why the others have drifted off here and
[19:15] drifted off there
[19:17] it isn't the fact that i have kept
[19:19] myself with the fact that he has kept me
[19:22] i know elijah was having a pity party
[19:24] one day and
[19:25] after he had this marvelous example of
[19:28] god's power
[19:29] up on mount carmel and he was he sat
[19:31] there and he called down the fire from
[19:33] heaven and consumed the sacrifice and
[19:35] all that stuff
[19:36] and after this mighty display of power
[19:39] then then uh jezebel said i'm going to
[19:41] take you and i'm going to kill you just
[19:43] like you did my prophet my my uh
[19:46] priests
[19:48] and so he was running away and finally
[19:51] he ended up in a mountain
[19:53] and he went god asked him what are you
[19:54] doing here so i'm the only one left
[19:56] i'm the only one that deserves you i'm
[19:58] the only one that loves you i'm the only
[19:59] one that cares about you no i've you
[20:01] know basically i've had enough take me
[20:03] home
[20:04] and god says now well just just wait a
[20:06] minute
[20:08] he says you're not the only one
[20:10] i have reserved to myself seven thousand
[20:14] that have not bowed the knee to baal
[20:17] god
[20:18] reserved
[20:20] they could not keep themselves god kept
[20:23] them
[20:25] who's keeping you
[20:26] god's keeping you
[20:29] he's watching over his bride some of
[20:31] god's going to have a bride no he has
[20:33] one
[20:34] and we are we are that bride
[20:37] and he has watched over us to ensure us
[20:40] that we will make it to the end of the
[20:42] journey
[20:43] brother branham says e fell
[20:45] but he says they're coming there's
[20:47] coming a bride the second eve and he
[20:49] says she cannot fall
[20:51] because i will ensure she cannot fall i
[20:54] will ensure that she will not be
[20:55] deceived i will ensure that she can she
[20:57] won't drift away off to the right or to
[20:59] the left no i have reserved to myself my
[21:02] bride and i am watching over my bride
[21:04] and i'm going to see to it that my bride
[21:07] finishes the journey that my bride will
[21:09] never fall my bride will never accept
[21:11] something which is false no my bride i
[21:13] will watch over her i will protect her i
[21:15] will keep her
[21:17] so it's not you keeping you
[21:20] it's god keeping you
[21:22] this should allow you to relax
[21:25] i mean not relax to the point where you
[21:26] just kind of accept any piece of trash
[21:28] that comes down the road no but it's
[21:30] able to relax in christ
[21:33] saying god you've seen me this far
[21:34] you've taken care of me this far and so
[21:37] lord i'm relying upon you to continue to
[21:39] watch over me and to keep me and to
[21:41] guide me i'm relying upon you to give me
[21:43] the revelation of your word that i have
[21:45] need of for today
[21:48] and if we can get into that that
[21:50] understanding
[21:52] it takes a lot of the struggle out
[21:55] it takes to me it takes a lot of the
[21:57] worry out god you've carried me this far
[21:59] you've watched over me this far you've
[22:01] protected me this far well if you've
[22:03] done this far i expect you to continue
[22:05] the journey i expect you to continue to
[22:07] watch over me and take care of me
[22:09] because i have committed myself to you
[22:11] lord and i believe i'm part of your
[22:13] bride and that makes me a part of you
[22:16] but lord i'm relying upon you to keep me
[22:19] i'm not relying upon myself
[22:22] it goes on in galatians but before it
[22:24] came
[22:25] but before faith came we were kept under
[22:27] the law we were set up unto the faith
[22:29] that we should afterward were revealed
[22:32] why was the law given
[22:35] to take the jewish nation and to sit
[22:37] there and and to have them to remain as
[22:40] an entity so that god in the end could
[22:42] bring jesus christ through them
[22:46] the law was to keep them and when you
[22:48] look at the jewish nation it's the law
[22:50] that has separated them
[22:52] when we lived in israel um we
[22:55] we could visit in their house
[22:57] but they could not come and visit in
[22:59] ours
[23:00] we could we did not keep our house
[23:02] kosher
[23:03] we had milk and meat together that was
[23:06] forbidden for them
[23:07] and if in during this time of year also
[23:10] during the passover
[23:12] i think during the time anyway they have
[23:14] to go through their house and have to
[23:15] remove all of the leaven
[23:17] and so in essence in their home they
[23:18] have two kitchens
[23:20] two sets of pots two sets of pans two
[23:22] sets of everything and only use one time
[23:25] a year
[23:26] so that's that's all walled off that's
[23:28] all protected out and so the certain
[23:30] time of the year all of a sudden they
[23:32] take that curtain down and then they
[23:33] used to use those at your which were one
[23:35] time a year for one week
[23:38] okay
[23:39] the law was kept so like i say we could
[23:41] visit them they could not visit us
[23:43] okay but here again that's what kept
[23:45] them separate
[23:47] it's the the food the food laws which
[23:49] they have and a few other things but the
[23:52] law kept them so that so that that seed
[23:55] could remain pure
[23:57] so that christ could come
[24:00] he said it goes on in verse 24 it says
[24:02] wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
[24:04] to bring us to christ that we might be
[24:06] justified by faith
[24:09] it's under the law that we understand
[24:11] god what god is expecting of us
[24:14] when we become a christian
[24:17] we become aware of god we become aware
[24:19] of his holiness we become aware of his
[24:21] purity
[24:23] we become aware of the fact that in him
[24:25] there is no darkness in him there is no
[24:27] sin in him there is no shadow of turning
[24:29] no he is pure and he is righteous and he
[24:31] is holy
[24:33] but he expects us to be that also
[24:36] it isn't up to us we can live any kind
[24:38] of a life
[24:40] it isn't up to us we can go and become
[24:42] part of the world and interact with the
[24:43] world and just make it so that there's
[24:45] no difference between us and between
[24:47] them
[24:48] no the law shows us what god expects us
[24:50] to be the law of the law shows us how he
[24:53] expects us to act and how he expects us
[24:55] to live
[24:57] and some people they look at the law and
[24:58] says oh man this is so restrictive
[25:02] oh i can't go here and i can't go there
[25:04] and i can't do this and i can't do that
[25:05] and oh i wish i wasn't a christian
[25:07] because then i could go ahead and i
[25:08] could groove the world and do the things
[25:09] i want to do
[25:11] well
[25:12] if that's your opinion you never met
[25:13] jesus christ
[25:15] because see when you come to jesus
[25:17] christ it's a love affair
[25:20] it's a love relationship between you and
[25:22] between him he says if you love me he
[25:25] says then you'll keep my commandments
[25:26] and the commandments will not be
[25:28] burdensome to you
[25:30] but because you love me he says you will
[25:31] do this and you will do this willingly
[25:33] because of the love that you have for me
[25:39] it goes on and says
[25:41] but after that faith has come
[25:44] he says we are no longer under a
[25:45] schoolmaster for we are all the children
[25:47] of god by the faith in jesus christ
[25:50] when faith actually comes when we
[25:52] believe on jesus christ as our savior
[25:55] and then we accept him as our savior and
[25:57] we go through the water baptism and
[25:59] we're and we and all of a sudden god
[26:01] comes and fills us with the holy spirit
[26:04] then something comes inside of us
[26:06] and no longer do we have to read the law
[26:09] no longer do are we concerned with
[26:11] obeying this and obeying that no but
[26:13] something comes inside of us and begins
[26:15] to change you from the inside out
[26:17] it isn't you struggling and striving to
[26:20] do this and struggling and striving to
[26:21] overcome no what you do is you learn to
[26:24] rest in god and then you let god perform
[26:26] his work through you
[26:28] he lets god change you he says in the
[26:31] new covenant he says i'm going to take
[26:32] my law and write them in their hearts
[26:34] and in their mind
[26:35] that means it's going to become
[26:36] literally a part of you
[26:38] the law and you you unite together the
[26:40] law and you literally becomes one
[26:43] and therefore you keep the law because
[26:45] now it's your nature to do that
[26:48] and therefore if it's your nature to do
[26:49] that it's no longer a struggle
[26:56] in ephesians 2 and 14 it says for he is
[26:59] our peace who hath made both one and has
[27:01] broken down the middle wall of partition
[27:02] between us
[27:04] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[27:06] even the law of commandments contained
[27:07] in ordinances for to make of himself
[27:09] twain one new man so making peace and
[27:12] that he might consider that he might
[27:14] reconcile both unto god in one body by
[27:16] the cross having slain the enmity
[27:19] thereby
[27:20] when jesus christ came he fulfilled the
[27:23] law
[27:24] when jesus christ came that he he took
[27:27] and by his sacrifice at calvary he
[27:30] fulfilled the requirements of the law to
[27:32] redeem that which was a part of him from
[27:34] the beginning
[27:36] and in jesus christ he now there's
[27:39] in jesus christ there is no distinction
[27:41] between jew and gentile
[27:43] we're all one body in jesus christ
[27:46] because the law and the commandments the
[27:47] food laws and all those other things
[27:49] they've all gone by the wayside
[27:51] i know when we lived in israel for a
[27:53] while we
[27:55] it was easy for us as christians to all
[27:58] of a sudden take on jewish traits
[28:00] as all of a sudden easy for us to go
[28:02] ahead and partake of their of the uh
[28:06] of the different festivals which they
[28:07] have
[28:08] and and there it's it's it's
[28:11] there was a pressure put upon us because
[28:13] of the country which we were living in
[28:16] and those that had remained in israel
[28:18] even today they're more jewish they're
[28:20] more israelite if you are
[28:23] than they are christian
[28:24] in fact a lot of them have forsaken
[28:26] christianity and basically they have
[28:28] been assimilated into the jewish economy
[28:32] but see we we were not supposed to
[28:33] become assimilated into the jewish
[28:35] economy no we were to remain separate
[28:38] we were still we were to show them what
[28:40] jesus christ is
[28:42] we were to show them that the law has
[28:43] been done been done away with and right
[28:45] and by now by being in jesus christ he
[28:48] says now there's a freedom that we have
[28:51] because now that law has become a part
[28:53] of us
[28:54] we keep the law because it's our nature
[28:56] to do so
[28:58] because here again that's christianity
[29:02] going on in galatians 4 it says now i
[29:03] say that in heir as long as he is a
[29:06] child he differed nothing from a servant
[29:07] though he be lord of all
[29:09] but as under tutors and governors until
[29:11] the time appointed of the father
[29:13] so it says even so we when we were
[29:15] children were under the bondage under
[29:16] the elements of the world but when the
[29:18] fullness of time was come god sent forth
[29:20] the son made of a woman made under the
[29:22] law to redeem them they were under the
[29:24] law that we might receive the adoption
[29:25] of sons and because you are sons god has
[29:28] sent forth the spirit of a son into your
[29:30] hearts crying
[29:31] of a father
[29:33] he goes on here and says we were in the
[29:34] world
[29:36] you're subject to the world
[29:37] satan was our master he was the one that
[29:40] controlled our lives he was the one that
[29:42] dictated he was the one that directed us
[29:44] he was the one
[29:46] by his by his demons or whatever like
[29:48] that he would sit there and he would he
[29:49] would swing you this way and he would
[29:51] swing you that way
[29:53] and because we're in flesh this there
[29:55] the flesh likes the world
[29:58] it's what you grew up with
[30:00] it's what you grew up in
[30:03] why do you some people like sports i was
[30:05] never any good at it so i never really
[30:07] developed an in any liking for it but i
[30:10] mean but there's a lot of people i mean
[30:11] i see as their children were growing up
[30:14] the father liked football his son likes
[30:16] football and so they played football and
[30:18] in in essence i guess there's nothing
[30:20] wrong with that i mean i was i was never
[30:23] any good at it i was always short
[30:25] couldn't run fast
[30:26] in fact i remember once they finally
[30:28] gave me the football in in one of the in
[30:31] grade school
[30:32] well i ran toward the wrong goal
[30:35] i got all the way to that one and
[30:36] somebody says hey that's the wrong one
[30:38] really so i had to run the whole length
[30:40] going the other direction and invite all
[30:41] these people trying to tackle me that
[30:43] shows you how much i knew about football
[30:46] but here but here again but i watched i
[30:48] watched the young people
[30:51] but see
[30:52] sports is competitive
[30:55] and where i and in one regard i don't
[30:58] brother branham brother brown when he
[30:59] was he was playing with something they
[31:01] were throwing darts
[31:02] and i think brother perry greene made
[31:04] mention of the fact when he was up there
[31:06] camping with him on brother branham
[31:08] could take darts and he could throw them
[31:09] in the bull's eye
[31:10] every time
[31:12] not miss one
[31:14] but then when he was playing against
[31:16] somebody else
[31:17] he would let you win
[31:20] he would sit there you might you might
[31:21] hit you know the 10 and the five and
[31:23] something like that well he would sit
[31:24] there and he would miss the whole thing
[31:25] a couple three times and he would hit
[31:27] the ones and the fours or whatever but
[31:29] he wanted the other one to
[31:31] win
[31:32] brother branham was not competitive
[31:35] he wanted you to experience the joy it
[31:37] was of being the one hey man look at me
[31:39] look at look at i i beat the prophet
[31:42] well no he let you win okay i mean
[31:45] be be honest with yourself
[31:47] but brother branham it's it's not about
[31:49] complete about being competitive
[31:51] and even in christianity it's not about
[31:53] being competitive against other people
[31:57] i i am me
[31:58] good bad or indifferent i am what i am
[32:01] i mean yeah there was once i tried to
[32:03] mimic another minister and
[32:06] i felt flat on my face twice and figured
[32:08] enough of that so i'll just go ahead
[32:10] i'll be me
[32:11] and uh yeah like i say good bad and
[32:13] different i am what i am by the grace of
[32:15] god and i have my own style some people
[32:18] like it some people don't that's their
[32:20] problem not mine because i can't be
[32:22] anything other than what i i am
[32:25] but we're not being competitive against
[32:27] each other
[32:29] we are in a race to run
[32:31] but it's not running against somebody
[32:33] else
[32:35] we're running against ourself
[32:37] because satan sits there and he will try
[32:39] and hinder and he will try and make it
[32:41] so you don't finish the race and he will
[32:43] try and put obstacles in your path and
[32:45] so what you have to do is realize what
[32:47] he is trying to do because there is a
[32:49] goal which has been set before us
[32:51] and we are trying to reach that goal
[32:54] which means sometimes we have to jump
[32:56] over the hurdles we have to go around
[32:57] the obstacles we have to do all these
[32:59] other types of things but there's a goal
[33:01] which is set before us and the problem
[33:03] that we have as ourselves
[33:05] because sometimes we get weary and well
[33:07] doing
[33:08] sometimes all of a sudden something
[33:10] an obstacle comes up and we look and
[33:12] figure
[33:13] man there ain't no way i can overcome
[33:15] that one
[33:16] and if you rely upon yourself then no
[33:18] you can't
[33:20] but if you go back into the scriptures
[33:21] and says lord i can do all things
[33:23] through you that strengthens me
[33:25] and if you can and so i can do all i
[33:27] could overcome everything that said that
[33:29] is said in the past that it's in my way
[33:32] i can overcome everything because you
[33:34] are the one in me and you are going to
[33:35] enable me to to run the race and to
[33:39] complete that which you've given to me
[33:40] to do
[33:42] and says he
[33:44] came to redeem when the fullness of time
[33:46] came god sent forth the son made every
[33:48] woman under the law he had to be born
[33:50] under the law because he had to fulfill
[33:53] that law
[33:54] he had to be
[33:55] born into under the jewish culture
[33:57] because he had to fulfill the jewish law
[34:00] but so the fullness of time came he came
[34:03] in god's timing and god's purpose he
[34:05] came
[34:06] and he fulfilled that law he he lived a
[34:08] life of perfect a perfection
[34:10] like jesus asked me who can who can
[34:13] condemn me of sin
[34:14] well he never he never sinned he always
[34:17] fulfilled the law
[34:18] but he did that and then he was hung
[34:20] upon the cross as the sacrifice for our
[34:23] sins for my sins
[34:25] and because he did that now now all of
[34:27] us and i can overcome everything through
[34:29] him
[34:30] but he did that so he could redeem me
[34:33] he could set me free from satan
[34:36] he could he can make it so satan no
[34:38] longer has and has any authority over me
[34:41] satan no longer
[34:42] no longer has the right to control me
[34:46] i give him the opportunities that's true
[34:49] but that's my fault not what god has
[34:51] done
[34:52] but he came to redeem me why so i can
[34:55] come to adoption
[34:57] and brother branham says adoption means
[34:59] that your name on the book is
[35:00] on the check is the same as if if it's
[35:03] god speaking
[35:04] and we are coming to the time in in
[35:08] we are coming to the time when we are
[35:10] supposed to be coming into adoption
[35:14] we as the bride of jesus christ are
[35:16] going to be the final are going to be
[35:18] the final example to this world
[35:21] so we have to come to adoption a full
[35:24] adoption will not take place until the
[35:25] changing of our body but brother branham
[35:28] talks about it in other places he says
[35:30] no he says he says the bride should
[35:31] already be approaching this this this
[35:33] thing
[35:34] and then we saw it in brother bradham
[35:37] oh he was there on son running for
[35:39] squirrels
[35:41] and god spoken to him and says where do
[35:42] you want how many squirrels do you want
[35:44] he says well i want three
[35:45] well where do you want the first one
[35:47] so god instructed brother branham to
[35:50] speak the word
[35:52] it wasn't brother brown says hey i'm
[35:53] here in the here in in
[35:55] in hunting out for squirrels all right
[35:58] let's just speak the word
[36:00] if he'd have been under his own unction
[36:02] no it never would have happened
[36:03] but god instructed him
[36:06] when he was up there up there in
[36:08] colorado and all of a sudden the storm
[36:09] came
[36:11] god says turn around and go back up the
[36:12] mountain
[36:14] oh
[36:15] well that means i'm going to die
[36:17] i mean that's what he thought
[36:19] and then god spoke to him and says speak
[36:21] to the storm
[36:24] oh
[36:25] uh he said what you say that's exactly
[36:27] what it'll be
[36:29] so he spoke it and exactly what he spoke
[36:32] that's exactly what happened but see
[36:34] there was under god's instruction
[36:37] you can't just have the spoken word just
[36:39] because you think you can speak it
[36:42] i i wrestled with this a little bit
[36:44] before because i was thinking about you
[36:45] know what can what can i do as a son
[36:48] what rights and privileges do i have as
[36:50] god's son
[36:52] the bible says
[36:53] you have not because you asked not
[36:56] so it's free to ask
[36:59] and when somebody is sick we ask we pray
[37:02] we claim the promises we go back to the
[37:04] scriptures god this is your promise to
[37:06] us and so we begin to speak based upon
[37:09] the promises god has given unto us but
[37:11] now if it comes down to the having the
[37:13] spoken word
[37:15] that to me is something different
[37:17] because then that has to come from the
[37:19] unction of god
[37:21] that has to be and this is my opinion
[37:23] okay but i god has to tell me to speak
[37:26] it or god has to direct me to speak it
[37:29] i know we had one brother in our church
[37:31] and he had operation on his elbow
[37:34] the doctor the doctors did the best
[37:36] which they could
[37:38] but then he developed an infection in it
[37:40] so the doctors treated him with the
[37:42] antibiotics and it seemed to go away
[37:45] and then it came back
[37:47] well then they had to go in and clean it
[37:48] all out again and put more antibiotics
[37:50] in it
[37:52] and okay
[37:53] and it seemed to reside
[37:56] and then it came back
[37:58] it can only happen so many times and
[38:00] then they have to amputate
[38:02] and then god instructed me he says i
[38:04] want you to go pray for him
[38:07] i says well there's the pastor there's
[38:08] the deacons there's a trust station or
[38:10] who am i to go and you know and i hate
[38:12] driving into charlotte
[38:16] but i was obedient i went
[38:18] and we found where he was at what room
[38:21] and then uh
[38:23] we talked a little bit and he said you
[38:24] know why i'm here he says well no not
[38:26] really
[38:27] i said god told me that this is not a
[38:29] physical problem this is a spiritual
[38:31] problem
[38:32] and so i have come to rebuke that spirit
[38:35] that's causing that infection so that
[38:37] you can be healed
[38:39] and believing god had sent me i prayed
[38:42] in that manner
[38:44] then the infection went away and
[38:46] everything went fine
[38:48] but here again that was by god leading
[38:50] for me all of a sudden the guns are
[38:52] called down the fire from heaven and
[38:53] says you know and command this and
[38:55] command that no i have to have an
[38:57] unction i have to have a leading
[38:59] i have to believe that it's god's will
[39:01] for me to do and to say the things which
[39:03] i do
[39:09] to redeem them they were under the law
[39:10] that we might receive the adoption of
[39:11] sons and because you are sons god has
[39:13] sent forth the spirit of a son into your
[39:15] heart's crying abba father
[39:17] which means you recognize god
[39:19] is your father
[39:21] you have earthly parents that may be
[39:23] true
[39:24] but yet god himself is your father
[39:28] and do you understand the implications
[39:30] of that statement
[39:32] if god is your father that means you are
[39:35] his son
[39:36] and because you are his son their
[39:38] privilege would just go away which co
[39:40] which you know which is is part of of
[39:42] being a son
[39:44] and as you grow and and brother branham
[39:46] talks about how his sister
[39:48] a father will take his son
[39:51] and he will train him in the business
[39:54] until finally after the after the sun
[39:56] has reached the level of maturity where
[39:58] where he the father can trust his son
[40:00] with the business
[40:01] then he will begin to turn the business
[40:03] over to his son
[40:05] and then after a while he takes his son
[40:08] out and adopts him into the family which
[40:10] means whatever he says is the same as
[40:12] the father saying
[40:14] but see this is where the bride should
[40:16] be coming
[40:18] you are god's child
[40:20] god is
[40:22] your father
[40:23] and if you could recognize god is your
[40:25] father and you can learn to be obedient
[40:28] to your father and he will teach you how
[40:30] to rule in the kingdom that god has put
[40:32] you into then and only then can he trust
[40:35] you with the spoken word
[40:37] brother brown says power
[40:40] power without character is satanic
[40:43] you don't believe that look at our
[40:44] government
[40:46] but yet if you begin to understand that
[40:48] you that if god if christ's character
[40:51] can come and be manifested in you
[40:54] and it's no longer you living but christ
[40:56] living through you
[40:58] then the very character of christ is in
[41:01] you
[41:01] and when that character of christ is in
[41:03] you and you become obedient unto the
[41:05] father
[41:06] then he can begin to trust you it took
[41:08] brother branham in his life
[41:10] brother branham was in one place and and
[41:12] uh he
[41:14] god told him he says there's a trap laid
[41:16] for you
[41:18] and he wouldn't tell brother branham
[41:19] what it was
[41:21] so then what happened was all of a
[41:23] sudden in brother brown's meeting all of
[41:25] a sudden a couple of young people were
[41:26] sitting on the front row and they
[41:27] started making love to each other
[41:30] and brother branham warned her two or
[41:31] three times don't do that
[41:33] there's other places to do that
[41:35] and then god spoke to him and says what
[41:37] you say
[41:39] that
[41:40] is what will happen
[41:41] and there's a pause
[41:43] in that sermon
[41:45] and then brother rahm says i forgive you
[41:47] for that
[41:49] because god was going to test him
[41:52] what will you do with the spoken word
[41:55] but the character of christ came over
[41:58] and and took control and and it was god
[42:00] it was it was christ speaking through
[42:02] him i will forgive you for that
[42:07] and from that point on then god can
[42:09] trust him with more and more of the
[42:11] spoken word
[42:14] and first john or in john 1 and going
[42:16] from 10 to 13.
[42:18] it says jesus christ was in the world
[42:19] the world was made by him and the world
[42:21] knew him not he came into his own his
[42:23] own received him not
[42:25] but as many as received him to them gave
[42:27] he the power to become the sons of god
[42:29] even to them that believe on his name
[42:31] which were born not of blood nor of the
[42:33] will of the flesh nor the will of man
[42:36] but of god
[42:38] you were born because you are a part of
[42:40] god from the beginning
[42:42] in the process of time you came into
[42:44] manifestation
[42:46] god watched over your parents and
[42:48] grandparents however many generations
[42:50] back to bring you to the to bring you to
[42:52] the place where you are now with all the
[42:55] characters and
[42:56] faults and and and and whatever else
[42:59] they can't came along with it
[43:01] but he came along and he placed you in
[43:03] this generation because you are going to
[43:05] be the final manifestation of god to
[43:07] this earth
[43:10] they tell me when a relay race they sit
[43:11] there they save the strongest one to
[43:14] last
[43:15] you are the strongest ones
[43:18] you are a part of god from the beginning
[43:20] so what did he do he reserved you for
[43:22] this generation because he knew he could
[43:25] take control of your bodies and he could
[43:27] begin to express himself through you
[43:31] and so you are in a race to run and but
[43:34] all those that have gone on before us
[43:35] they cannot be made perfect without us
[43:37] they're waiting for us to finish the
[43:39] race they're waiting for us to come into
[43:41] the manifestation of the sons of god
[43:43] they're waiting for us to so become one
[43:45] with jesus christ until it's no longer i
[43:47] who live but christ who lives in me and
[43:50] then when we come to that place in our
[43:52] in our christian walk then all of a
[43:53] sudden god can trust us and god can
[43:55] begin to manifest and express himself
[43:57] through us
[44:03] in christ the mystery of god revealed
[44:05] brother branham makes a statement
[44:07] making his mystery known to his bride
[44:09] tree
[44:10] redeemed by christ the second adam going
[44:13] back home to be restored back to the
[44:15] original edom free from death sickness
[44:17] sorrow shame going back with eternal
[44:20] life
[44:22] christ redeemed us the second adam to
[44:24] take us back home
[44:27] to take us back to be what god intended
[44:29] for us to be in him from the beginning
[44:33] you're sons and daughters of god
[44:36] you're living in this world
[44:38] as we age we have problems
[44:40] well but but god is going to take us
[44:42] back to the eden condition he's going to
[44:44] take us back to the place where we can
[44:46] actually live as sons and daughters of
[44:49] god without the clumberson-ness of the
[44:51] flesh that we now live in
[44:53] and this is where he he redeemed us
[44:55] he did all of this to carry us back into
[44:57] that point but see we're at the end of
[44:59] all things
[45:01] we're at the time when god wants to sow
[45:04] it wants to sow come and live in us
[45:07] until it's no longer us living but
[45:09] christ and when we can come to that when
[45:12] we can come to that position then then
[45:14] all of a sudden god can begin to live
[45:15] and manifest himself through us
[45:19] and then we can begin to experience what
[45:21] it would have been like in eden
[45:24] then we can have peace
[45:26] then we can begin to then we can we can
[45:28] rejoice in the holy spirit we can enter
[45:30] into his presence we can come
[45:33] when adam was when adam and eve were in
[45:35] the garden
[45:36] there was open fellowship with god
[45:39] there wasn't anything to hinder them
[45:42] but see in christ now we also enter into
[45:44] that relationship
[45:46] because of the blood god doesn't see us
[45:48] he looks at us through the blood brother
[45:50] branham expresses that
[45:52] and so what do we begin to understand i
[45:54] have open fellowship with my father
[45:56] sin is not there as a barrier between me
[45:59] and between him
[46:00] when i make a mistake i confess it once
[46:02] i've confessed it's in the sea of god
[46:03] for forgetfulness and then i've
[46:05] reestablished my relationship
[46:08] i have not always been a perfect child
[46:12] there were times i aggravated my mom
[46:15] onto the place where she looked at me
[46:17] and said wait till your dad gets home
[46:20] and boy i knew i was in trouble then
[46:23] so when dad came home from work i made
[46:25] sure he had his slippers
[46:27] made sure he had a glass of water made
[46:28] sure the paper was there where he wanted
[46:30] it
[46:31] and he knew all right what did you do
[46:34] today oh nothing dad i was the perfect
[46:36] little angel so let me talk to your mom
[46:40] and then i would have to go out and get
[46:41] a switch
[46:43] and then i would stand up for dinner
[46:46] but i was always his son
[46:49] i had to suffer the consequences of what
[46:51] i had done during that day but i was
[46:53] always his son
[46:55] well i am god's son
[46:59] well if i make mistakes yeah i have to
[47:01] there are penalties which have to be you
[47:03] know you you reap what you sow
[47:05] but still god in his mercy lots of times
[47:08] he will he will make it not as bad as it
[47:10] could be
[47:11] but here again but it comes down down to
[47:14] the to the place that i i am his son
[47:17] and he's taking me back to the place
[47:19] where once i've confessed my faults once
[47:21] i've confessed that i have done wrong
[47:22] then all of a sudden i have
[47:23] reestablished that relationship
[47:26] and after my dad made it so i had to
[47:28] stand up for dinner
[47:30] then he would come and he would love me
[47:31] and he would say it's all right
[47:33] you're still my son
[47:36] i still love you okay so the
[47:39] relationship here again was
[47:40] reestablished
[47:49] brother branham makes mention of the
[47:51] fact
[47:56] when i study the message
[47:58] i gain understanding
[48:01] not revelation
[48:04] understanding i understand different
[48:08] things
[48:09] but i have i lack the revelation of some
[48:12] of those things
[48:13] i can say i am a son of god i have that
[48:16] by knowledge
[48:18] i have that because the scriptures tells
[48:20] me that
[48:21] i have that because god told me that
[48:24] but i don't have the full revelation of
[48:26] what it is to be a son
[48:28] and being able to have all the
[48:29] manifestations and being able to to
[48:31] experience and be able to express god in
[48:33] the way that i desire to
[48:35] but we're coming to a time when all of a
[48:38] sudden god is opening his word and his
[48:40] understanding to us even more and more
[48:42] and one of these days the revelation of
[48:44] what god has tried to tell us through
[48:45] the prophet one of these days that
[48:48] revelation will come
[48:50] and see god holds that revelation
[48:53] you can study all that you want
[48:56] i mean that what the bible tells us in
[48:58] the old testament they're the the
[49:00] prophets and stuff after they prophesied
[49:02] they looked at this and trying to figure
[49:03] out how is this going to happen how is
[49:05] he going to come what's he going to
[49:06] manifest what's he going to do this how
[49:08] is he going to do that and they became
[49:09] totally different than what they their
[49:11] imagination was
[49:13] and so here again when we look at what's
[49:15] going on in the world today
[49:18] um we didn't figure covert would come
[49:21] we didn't figure russia would invade
[49:22] ukraine
[49:24] we didn't figure ukraine would put up
[49:26] the fight that it's doing
[49:27] we didn't figure we didn't figure all
[49:29] the mess that's going on within our
[49:31] within our our our nation
[49:34] but see god knew all of these things
[49:37] because it's like
[49:39] i think
[49:40] my brother chad made mention once
[49:42] when um
[49:43] joshua was out there he was overlooking
[49:45] the city
[49:47] and all of a sudden the angel appeared
[49:48] unto him and
[49:49] joshua pulled out his sword are you
[49:51] forced or for the enemy
[49:53] he said neither one
[49:55] i'm not for you and i'm not for your
[49:57] enemy i'm here to make sure that the
[49:59] word of god is fulfilled
[50:01] i'm here to make sure that god's plan
[50:03] that he has already purposed before the
[50:05] foundation of the world i am here to
[50:07] make sure that
[50:08] is fulfilled
[50:11] so it doesn't matter what we see going
[50:12] on in our nation doesn't matter what we
[50:14] see going on into the world god is
[50:16] sovereign in what he does he wants his
[50:18] word fulfilled and he is fulfilling that
[50:22] word
[50:24] but it goes on on on here and
[50:27] um
[50:29] it's it is a so it's christ expressing
[50:31] this is mystery of god reveal he says so
[50:34] it's christ expressing himself in the
[50:35] individual
[50:36] he says the new birth is birth is christ
[50:39] the new birth it's christ it's a
[50:41] revelation it's the revelation of god
[50:43] living in you
[50:45] and this is the revelation he said god
[50:47] has revealed to you this great mystery
[50:49] this mystery of what brother brown or
[50:51] paul wrote about this mystery the great
[50:53] mystery which has been hidden from time
[50:55] and memorial all the way down through
[50:56] the scriptures he said but now this
[50:58] mystery is being revealed unto you which
[50:59] is christ living in you
[51:02] he goes on and to say
[51:05] he said that he said so god has revealed
[51:07] to you this great mystery and that's the
[51:09] new birth
[51:11] he said he said
[51:12] oh if the church only knew its position
[51:15] it will one day
[51:17] then the rapture will go
[51:19] when it knows what it is
[51:23] so when the final revelation comes of
[51:25] what we are
[51:27] that's when the rapture will come
[51:31] but see god holds that revelation
[51:34] if we knew who we were
[51:36] if we had the full revelation of what it
[51:39] means to be a son and daughter of god
[51:41] if we had the full revelation every
[51:43] everything that christ purchased for us
[51:45] at calvary if we had that full
[51:47] revelation within ourselves today
[51:50] we'd be out of here
[51:52] because there'd be no question
[51:54] i know i can do this i know i can
[51:56] command satan i know i can cast out the
[51:58] devils i know i can go and heal the sick
[52:00] i know i can raise the dead i can know i
[52:01] can stop the storm i know i can walk on
[52:03] the water i know i can do all these
[52:04] things because i'm god's son
[52:06] that's what jesus did
[52:09] we look at brother brown's life and
[52:10] ministry look at what god did through
[52:12] him
[52:13] and people want to limit what god did
[52:14] through him to him no he god was showing
[52:17] us what we are this is what you can do
[52:20] but you have to have the faith to
[52:22] believe it
[52:23] you have to have the revelation that
[52:25] what this is what god is trying to
[52:26] instruct you this is what god is trying
[52:28] to tell you
[52:30] this is who you are you are a son and
[52:33] daughter of god and as a son of god he
[52:34] says these are the things which you can
[52:36] naturally do by virtue of who you are
[52:40] and it goes on in in in the revelation
[52:43] of jesus christ he said satan knows that
[52:46] if the people can get the true
[52:47] revelation of the true church and what
[52:48] she is and what she stands for that she
[52:51] can do the greater works she will be an
[52:53] invincible army if they get the true
[52:55] revelation of the two spirits within the
[52:57] framework of the christian church and by
[52:59] god's spirit discern and withstand the
[53:00] antichrist spirit satan will be
[53:02] powerless before her
[53:04] we're in a battle
[53:07] and the battle is raging
[53:09] satan knows his end is coming too close
[53:12] he knows that he has to hinder us
[53:15] he knows that he has to keep us from
[53:17] getting the revelation of who we are but
[53:19] seek was once said revelation come
[53:22] satan's power will be powerless before
[53:24] him before
[53:27] before him so here again it comes down
[53:29] to the place where
[53:30] where when we begin to understand we're
[53:33] still going to be in a battle
[53:35] we're still going to be fighting
[53:37] but we but we will understand no i don't
[53:39] have to put up with this
[53:41] satan go pack your bags and leave i
[53:44] don't want you here anymore i'm tired of
[53:46] you have you harassing me i'm tired of
[53:48] the sickness i'm tired of the pain i'm
[53:49] tired of all the things which you have
[53:51] been doing in my life and the lives of
[53:53] other people
[53:55] and then we can command and because by
[53:57] virtue of who we are and then be having
[53:59] the revelation of who we are the fact
[54:01] that we are god so just we are god's
[54:03] children and we are the bride of jesus
[54:05] christ and we and all that jesus christ
[54:08] is we have access to
[54:11] when we begin to understand that then
[54:12] all of a sudden satan pops up his ugly
[54:14] head and we can hit him
[54:16] and the more he pops up his head
[54:17] eventually we get him bloody nose and
[54:19] black eyes kick him in the shin walk all
[54:20] over his back and do whatever else we
[54:22] can do to him
[54:23] but it comes down to the place when that
[54:25] revelation fully comes into us
[54:29] now yes say don't put up a battle
[54:31] he always does he always he always will
[54:34] but then we will have the ability to to
[54:36] command him
[54:38] like i said when you're when i when i
[54:40] was drafted into the army they they
[54:43] trained me
[54:45] to be able to be a lab tech
[54:48] others they tried to go out into the
[54:49] battlefield and shoot
[54:51] i went in as a conscientious objector
[54:53] therefore i wasn't
[54:55] i never trained with a rifle okay
[54:57] because i figured oh
[54:59] one of those might be my brother and i
[55:01] would hate to shoot my brother well
[55:03] i'm after you've been there for a little
[55:05] while yeah give me a rifle okay let's
[55:07] get down to business
[55:09] but here again but but
[55:11] we we have
[55:13] while i was over there in vietnam i mean
[55:15] the battle was there
[55:17] i mean the base camp that i was in they
[55:19] lob mortars into the base camp that i
[55:20] was living
[55:22] staying in
[55:23] um
[55:24] [Music]
[55:25] we had a helicopter and they had
[55:27] sandbags all the way around it
[55:30] well they lobbed one one mortar right on
[55:32] the middle of the guy's blades and
[55:34] destroyed it
[55:35] they knew where we were they knew how to
[55:37] hit us
[55:38] well we also knew how to hit them
[55:42] but here again it's a war
[55:44] but here again when we understand what
[55:46] we have access to when we begin to
[55:48] understand we have the power to command
[55:50] satan
[55:52] and we begin to see how satan works
[55:55] we begin to see all of a sudden you get
[55:56] in a nice church and all of a sudden
[55:58] satan will send somebody in and be nice
[56:00] and peaceful and quiet and all of a
[56:02] sudden he'll stick up his ugly head and
[56:04] try and create divisions within the
[56:06] congregation
[56:08] and when we begin to realize that then
[56:10] okay then we deal with it
[56:13] i know we had in the church i go to um
[56:17] at least brother brother henry greene
[56:20] i mean he had some people come into his
[56:22] into the church
[56:24] and he knew the spirit that guy had
[56:27] and so he hid it
[56:29] sunday after sunday after sunday after
[56:32] sunday
[56:33] until finally that person left
[56:36] they weren't going to convert
[56:38] so all and once that person left that he
[56:40] could get back to preaching the gospel
[56:42] to the rest of us
[56:43] but i mean here again but he knew he
[56:45] sensed that spirit and he knew that
[56:47] spirit was evil and he attacked it
[56:50] repeatedly day after every every service
[56:53] that there was
[56:54] okay but see this is this is the that's
[56:56] the function of the pastor
[56:58] i mean it's also the deacons and the
[57:00] trustees i mean i'm not limiting it to
[57:01] him but i mean once you understand how
[57:03] satan operates and you begin to notice
[57:06] the spirit that comes in he says you
[57:07] know then you can begin to do something
[57:13] you know brother branham often often
[57:15] makes a statement that we are him
[57:18] we're flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[57:20] bone
[57:21] and this type goes back to adam and eve
[57:22] in the garden and this is what i want to
[57:24] concentrate on a little bit
[57:26] when we begin to understand what when
[57:28] god took and he created adam
[57:31] he took adam adam was a spirit being
[57:33] adam was in a theophany form
[57:35] and then god says no adam he says you're
[57:37] supposed to be the ruler of the world
[57:40] and for you to understand the world for
[57:42] you to understand the the people the the
[57:44] animals that you are subject over the
[57:46] jordan the control over you need to
[57:48] experience what they experience
[57:51] and so then he made a temple of clay for
[57:53] adam and he put that temple they put
[57:54] that spirit and put it in that temple
[57:56] and so then man became a living soul
[57:58] which means that's that soul that the
[58:01] theophany now came and began to dwell in
[58:03] that body
[58:05] and so there adam would begin to go and
[58:07] he would begin to see the animals and he
[58:09] would name them and he would rejoice
[58:10] over the fact what god had done
[58:13] but yet
[58:14] adam could not fellowship with anybody
[58:17] he could not relate to the animals i
[58:19] mean we have a pet dog
[58:21] you know we can throw his little toy and
[58:23] he'll run after it after about the third
[58:24] time he says i've had enough of this
[58:26] nonsense and he goes and crawls into his
[58:27] little house and goes for
[58:29] whatever
[58:30] well i can only fellowship with him so
[58:32] much
[58:33] when he wants to be petted he jumps on
[58:35] my lap when he doesn't want it all of a
[58:36] sudden he goes back he goes and finds
[58:38] his own little place to lay down okay
[58:41] but here again
[58:42] you can only fellowship with him so much
[58:45] so god he said okay adam you're lonely
[58:47] he says just like god said he was lonely
[58:50] because in god there was a father in god
[58:52] there was a family and he wanted to have
[58:54] fellowship with that family you're part
[58:56] of that family
[58:58] and so all of a sudden he took adam and
[58:59] he put adam to sleep he pulled out a rib
[59:02] and then he created another body for the
[59:04] and that and that's when he separated
[59:06] the
[59:06] the theophany of eve and put it in that
[59:08] body
[59:10] and so and here again so when eat when
[59:12] adam looked at eve he says your flesh is
[59:14] my flesh and your bone of my bone
[59:17] and god when he when he looked at them
[59:19] he called their name adam
[59:21] god never regarded them as two people he
[59:24] always regarded them as a single entity
[59:27] but see we were in jesus christ
[59:30] when
[59:31] in the beginning was the word the word
[59:32] was with god and the word was god we
[59:34] were part of that the offending when god
[59:36] created that theophany that he himself
[59:38] dwelt in
[59:41] and this and this is where it all comes
[59:43] back down to this is this i mean when it
[59:45] talks about we're going to be flesh of
[59:46] his flesh and bone of his bone we have
[59:48] to realize we always were a part of god
[59:51] we were part of that theophany that god
[59:53] created and eventually that theophany
[59:54] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[59:57] brother brown says we were in that flesh
[59:59] and that body of jesus christ so when
[1:00:01] that body of jesus christ hung up on the
[1:00:03] cross he says we were in that then
[1:00:06] and when god judged that sin what did he
[1:00:07] do we were judged in that body then by
[1:00:10] taking our sins and nailing it to his
[1:00:11] cross that's why the bible says we can
[1:00:14] become the very righteousness of god
[1:00:17] see god made his in rising of the son he
[1:00:20] says when god made his first bridegroom
[1:00:22] he made the bridegroom first and he was
[1:00:24] both man and woman in spirit form in
[1:00:26] spirit formed him in the dust of the
[1:00:28] earth to make him material and notice
[1:00:30] when he made eve from adam he took not
[1:00:33] another piece of clay he took from the
[1:00:34] same piece of clay the same word for
[1:00:36] adam was a spoken word
[1:00:39] he said he says see he he took from him
[1:00:42] and and then taken the he had the
[1:00:44] masculine feminine spirit he took the
[1:00:46] feminist spirit away from adam and
[1:00:47] placed it in eve so it's still a part of
[1:00:50] adam's spirit it's adam's flesh
[1:00:54] so eve was part of eve was adam
[1:00:59] eve was an expression of adam
[1:01:03] okay we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:01:05] we were in that theophany when that
[1:01:07] theophany was formed
[1:01:09] when god through that theophany began to
[1:01:11] create the world and all the things that
[1:01:13] we see around us when god began to do
[1:01:15] that we were a part of that the
[1:01:16] offending
[1:01:19] and so when that theophany came into
[1:01:20] flesh we were in him at that point in
[1:01:22] time wrote brother banham talks about
[1:01:24] that
[1:01:26] it says in in smyrnan church it says the
[1:01:28] very plain language the true bride of
[1:01:30] christ was in the mind of god eternally
[1:01:31] though not expressed until each came
[1:01:33] forth in the designated decreed season
[1:01:36] as each member came forth it became
[1:01:38] expressed and took the place in the body
[1:01:40] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[1:01:42] word seed bride and though she is
[1:01:44] feminine in designation she's also
[1:01:46] called the body of christ it's very
[1:01:48] apparent that that she ought to be
[1:01:50] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:01:52] him and came from the same source was
[1:01:55] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[1:01:58] god in a many-membered body whereas god
[1:02:00] before was only in in one member
[1:02:03] and so here again we have when we begin
[1:02:05] to understand we were always a part of
[1:02:08] god
[1:02:09] we were part of that theophany
[1:02:12] and if we were a part of that theophany
[1:02:14] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:02:16] get us back into what we were in him
[1:02:18] from the beginning
[1:02:24] brother branham says in in god who's
[1:02:26] rich in mercy
[1:02:28] i'm only saying this not to mix up
[1:02:29] doctrine but to straighten it out
[1:02:31] that we might get away from this fear
[1:02:33] and the scare
[1:02:34] you don't know who you are
[1:02:36] you are not going to be but now you are
[1:02:38] the sons of god so you always were a son
[1:02:41] of god for when god had you in his
[1:02:43] thinking at the beginning you have to be
[1:02:45] some part of you your life that's in you
[1:02:47] now had to be with god before the before
[1:02:49] there well he says before he even became
[1:02:52] material on earth before there was
[1:02:53] anything but god you were in him you
[1:02:55] were one of his attributes he knowed
[1:02:57] what your name would be he know the
[1:02:59] color of your hair you would have and
[1:03:00] you know all about you
[1:03:03] so god knows you
[1:03:06] because you're him
[1:03:09] because you are a part of him
[1:03:11] you are a part of him from the beginning
[1:03:14] you are flesh it was flesh and bone of
[1:03:16] his bone when when god created that that
[1:03:19] theophany you were part of that
[1:03:20] theophany when that theophany was taken
[1:03:23] and manifested in flesh then although we
[1:03:24] were we were part of that theophany were
[1:03:27] part of that flesh being
[1:03:29] and then when he was hung up on the
[1:03:30] cross and there he died brother battle
[1:03:32] says he says just like god took a part
[1:03:34] of adam and he made the body for eve he
[1:03:36] says when jesus christ was smitten he
[1:03:38] said what did it do that released the
[1:03:42] bride so so you're not just human beings
[1:03:48] you're not just people walking around in
[1:03:50] human flesh and have to struggle with
[1:03:51] this and struggle with that no you are
[1:03:54] you are a part of god you always were a
[1:03:56] part of god i mean brother branham god
[1:03:59] what god has been trying to tell the
[1:04:00] bride no you are jesus christ
[1:04:04] you literally you are jesus christ why
[1:04:06] because when
[1:04:08] it goes in
[1:04:11] brother man restoration the right jesus
[1:04:12] he says you're going to form what's
[1:04:14] known to me as your bride see all right
[1:04:16] i'll go he says you'll be part of me
[1:04:18] you'll be my bride my life
[1:04:21] will be in your body just as husband and
[1:04:23] wife as one person you and i are going
[1:04:25] to be one at that day you'll know that i
[1:04:27] am in the father the fathers and me i
[1:04:28] and you and you and me oh i just love
[1:04:31] that and satan gets so angry at that see
[1:04:33] the oneness of god
[1:04:37] you know what he's saying here
[1:04:41] you are a manifestation of god
[1:04:44] you are an expression of god
[1:04:48] and if you are the expression of god it
[1:04:51] basically in the way that he puts it
[1:04:53] here you don't just see the oneness of
[1:04:55] god he's almost elevating us to the
[1:04:57] place we're a part of the godhead
[1:04:59] we're not a part of the godhead and the
[1:05:01] fact that we can sit there and and we
[1:05:03] can do as we please we're not part of
[1:05:05] the godhead that we can dive on a
[1:05:07] cross for other people's sin no but we
[1:05:10] are an expression of god we we are to be
[1:05:12] the final voice to the final age we are
[1:05:14] to be the final manifestation of god in
[1:05:16] this age
[1:05:19] he said he said all that god was
[1:05:21] deported to christ
[1:05:22] and all the christ was important to the
[1:05:24] church he said there you are it makes
[1:05:26] them all one
[1:05:28] everything that god poured into jesus
[1:05:29] christ god emptied himself into jesus
[1:05:32] christ
[1:05:33] and jesus christ emptied himself into
[1:05:35] the bride
[1:05:37] and therefore the bride collectively is
[1:05:39] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:05:42] you are a part of god you are a
[1:05:44] manifestation of god you are an
[1:05:45] expression of god
[1:05:47] and so we need to start living like that
[1:05:49] we need to start acting like that we
[1:05:50] need we need to start taking the
[1:05:52] privilege that we have as being god's
[1:05:54] children and we need to be able to
[1:05:55] exercise that when we come across things
[1:05:57] which we have to fight against
[1:05:59] when all of a sudden satan throws
[1:06:01] something in our path we have the power
[1:06:03] to overcome that
[1:06:04] when all of a sudden i mean jesus christ
[1:06:06] he had his problems
[1:06:09] jesus christ i mean you know he he got
[1:06:11] hungry
[1:06:12] satan came to him and tempting him
[1:06:14] oh you think you're the son of god do
[1:06:16] you hmm
[1:06:18] fine if you are take these stones make
[1:06:20] them bread
[1:06:22] jesus says ah i could do that
[1:06:24] sure i could
[1:06:26] but it says it's written you shall not
[1:06:27] live by bread alone but by every word of
[1:06:29] god
[1:06:30] and satan says oh well this is different
[1:06:33] it takes him up to a pinnacle and says
[1:06:35] hey
[1:06:36] tell you what
[1:06:37] you see all those people down there
[1:06:39] yeah he says jump off
[1:06:41] and watch the angels come and take and
[1:06:43] glare guide you very gently down
[1:06:47] he says because then the scriptures say
[1:06:49] that he will give his angels charge over
[1:06:51] thee where you won't even stumble
[1:06:53] against a rock or whatever
[1:06:56] and jesus says you don't tempt god
[1:06:59] you don't put yourself into a situation
[1:07:01] where all of a sudden you you could
[1:07:03] where all of a sudden you you're you're
[1:07:05] trying to command god to do something
[1:07:07] that god never intended to do
[1:07:11] and he said all right tell you what
[1:07:12] bypass the cross if you are the son of
[1:07:14] god
[1:07:15] if you are the one that you say that you
[1:07:17] are he says the cross is your destiny
[1:07:21] tell you what worship me i'll give you
[1:07:23] the world
[1:07:25] jesus uh he says i'll get i'll get it in
[1:07:28] my under my own terms
[1:07:29] i'm not going to sit under your
[1:07:31] rulership
[1:07:33] but here again satan tempts us satan
[1:07:35] tries to control us satan does the
[1:07:36] things that he does trying to get us to
[1:07:38] deviate from the word
[1:07:41] because it's the word that we have to
[1:07:43] manifest it's the word that we have to
[1:07:44] obey it it's the word that god is trying
[1:07:46] to express through us
[1:07:49] and the life that we live all of it live
[1:07:51] that has to be the word made manifest
[1:07:53] into the generation which we're now
[1:07:55] living
[1:07:59] it says in first john
[1:08:02] it says in john
[1:08:03] john 1 he came into the world the world
[1:08:06] was made by him the world
[1:08:08] but the and the world knew him not he
[1:08:10] came unto his own which was the jews and
[1:08:12] his own received him not but as many
[1:08:14] received him to them gave you the power
[1:08:16] to become the legal right to become the
[1:08:18] sons of god even to them that believe on
[1:08:20] his name which were born not of blood
[1:08:21] nor the will of the flesh nor the will
[1:08:23] of man but of god
[1:08:25] god pre-pre-planned you when you would
[1:08:28] come
[1:08:30] he didn't have you come and luther's day
[1:08:32] he didn't have you come in methodist day
[1:08:34] he didn't have you come pentecostal day
[1:08:36] he had you for this day
[1:08:39] because he has a purpose for you being
[1:08:41] here
[1:08:43] it's not just to come to church and sing
[1:08:45] songs and worship that's part of it we
[1:08:47] need to glorify him because there's
[1:08:48] something in us that wants to glorify
[1:08:50] there's something in us that wants to
[1:08:52] worship and there's something in us that
[1:08:53] wants to pray there's something in us
[1:08:55] that desires that fellowship that
[1:08:57] desires their closeness that intimacy
[1:08:59] that we can have with god
[1:09:02] but he said we in this generation have
[1:09:04] to overcome satan
[1:09:07] we in this generation have to show satan
[1:09:09] you don't control us
[1:09:12] god controls us we're living in satan's
[1:09:14] eden
[1:09:17] but he doesn't control
[1:09:18] us he's always attacking us he's always
[1:09:21] trying to get us to deviate from the
[1:09:23] word he's always trying to have us make
[1:09:25] ourselves something that we're not but
[1:09:26] he's sitting there trying to sit there
[1:09:28] and put us in situations where all of a
[1:09:30] sudden we will we will disobey god's
[1:09:32] word we will try to glorify ourselves
[1:09:35] we're not to glorify ourselves
[1:09:38] or to glorify god
[1:09:42] it goes on a philippian in in in two
[1:09:45] philippians 2 5-10 he said let this mind
[1:09:48] be in you which was also in christ jesus
[1:09:51] we are to think the same way he thought
[1:09:54] we are to consider ourselves the same
[1:09:56] way that he considered himself
[1:09:59] he says who being in the form of the
[1:10:01] full expression of god thought in that
[1:10:02] robbery to be equal with god but
[1:10:05] equal with god but made of himself no
[1:10:07] reputation took upon him the form the
[1:10:09] form of his servant and was made in the
[1:10:11] likeness of man
[1:10:13] when jesus christ was came into this
[1:10:15] world when he was born in the manger
[1:10:18] and we began when he knew who he was
[1:10:20] he thought it not robbery to equal with
[1:10:22] god he said i can claim to be god
[1:10:25] it's not taking away from god because i
[1:10:27] am god
[1:10:28] but he said he but he came
[1:10:31] he being a full expression of god
[1:10:34] he took upon himself the form of his
[1:10:36] servant
[1:10:39] some people think oh i have the power
[1:10:41] and look what i can do with the power
[1:10:44] if you have that attitude something's
[1:10:46] wrong
[1:10:48] because jesus came to serve
[1:10:51] jesus never used the power that he had
[1:10:53] for his own benefits
[1:10:56] if jesus wanted to be a millionaire he
[1:10:58] could have in his day
[1:11:00] i mean you know you set up a little
[1:11:02] stand
[1:11:03] and you have some people you want some
[1:11:04] water how much you want well you know 20
[1:11:07] liters would be good okay bring some
[1:11:08] water over
[1:11:09] and he blesses it okay money money money
[1:11:12] come on no pay up
[1:11:14] oh um
[1:11:16] you want some bread how many loaves you
[1:11:17] want
[1:11:18] well five would be nice so you take one
[1:11:20] break off five puts the original one
[1:11:22] back come on pay up
[1:11:24] i mean if you had a business and you had
[1:11:26] no overhead everything's profit
[1:11:28] okay
[1:11:30] but that's not what he did
[1:11:32] he said they're they're out of wine in a
[1:11:34] in a wedding
[1:11:36] okay bring the water he blessed it he'd
[1:11:38] never charged him for
[1:11:40] when he had that little kid's lunch
[1:11:43] he fed he fed a multitude
[1:11:45] he never he they didn't take up an
[1:11:47] offering no they took up the remnant
[1:11:51] i mean he he he came to help others he
[1:11:54] would go and and he would heal the sick
[1:11:56] he would raise the dead he would cast
[1:11:58] out demons
[1:12:00] and the only thing he asked a couple of
[1:12:01] them he said i think some lepers came
[1:12:03] into him and says and says if you will
[1:12:05] you can make us clean
[1:12:07] he says do you actually believe that
[1:12:10] yes i believe that fine and by your
[1:12:13] faith you're cleansed
[1:12:16] and it came to the place where they had
[1:12:17] to exercise their faith but he healed
[1:12:20] them and never charge anything
[1:12:24] so what do we do
[1:12:26] we are servants to mankind we are
[1:12:28] servants to each other
[1:12:31] somebody comes to you and asks and says
[1:12:32] i'm having this i'm where i you know i
[1:12:35] need prayer i have i have this this
[1:12:37] illness
[1:12:39] and okay you are you are a priest
[1:12:42] a priest intercedes on behalf of someone
[1:12:44] else
[1:12:46] and so what do you do you pray for them
[1:12:49] and watch god heal them
[1:12:52] okay
[1:12:53] you're
[1:12:54] you're performing the function of a
[1:12:56] priest
[1:12:57] and you're also a king you're king over
[1:12:59] what you're king over a spiritual
[1:13:00] kingdom what is a spiritual kingdom he
[1:13:02] says we rule over satan's kingdom
[1:13:05] when you take and you cast out a demon
[1:13:07] what are you doing you're ruling over
[1:13:08] satan's kingdom
[1:13:10] you're telling satan you no longer can
[1:13:11] possess this body now you have to leave
[1:13:13] because i am commanding you to leave
[1:13:16] therefore we are kings and priests and
[1:13:19] we do this without without without
[1:13:20] expecting anything in return
[1:13:25] why do we go to foreign countries
[1:13:27] when we go to foreign countries we pay
[1:13:29] our own way
[1:13:32] i mean i've we've been to india 15 over
[1:13:34] 15 years
[1:13:37] um
[1:13:38] yeah i paid my own way
[1:13:40] i mean the first five years i had to rob
[1:13:43] my bank account
[1:13:45] just enough to buy my tickets
[1:13:48] because i felt led
[1:13:50] so i went there and we ministered unto
[1:13:52] others
[1:13:54] there was no offering there was nothing
[1:13:56] coming back
[1:13:58] but this was god led me to go so i went
[1:14:01] and after a while then god began to
[1:14:02] supply funds from other sources but
[1:14:04] still it wasn't mine
[1:14:07] and i'm still very careful with what i
[1:14:09] do with what i receive
[1:14:10] but i'm there to serve
[1:14:13] i'm there to take a group of people and
[1:14:15] try and encourage them through the word
[1:14:18] to try and get them to understand what
[1:14:20] god has done in this generation to try
[1:14:22] and get them to understand god has done
[1:14:24] something in our generation god sent a
[1:14:26] prophet to us so we could understand the
[1:14:28] word
[1:14:29] and you need to understand the word you
[1:14:31] need to be able to grasp hold of the
[1:14:33] mysteries which god has been revealing
[1:14:35] unto us
[1:14:37] unto us through the prophet's messages
[1:14:40] and so you go into church after church
[1:14:42] after church what are you trying to do
[1:14:43] you're trying to encourage them you're
[1:14:44] trying to lift them up you're trying to
[1:14:46] teach them as much as possible this is
[1:14:48] this is the message this is who you are
[1:14:50] this is what god is trying to do in your
[1:14:52] life
[1:14:54] and encourage them to sit there and
[1:14:56] stand up against satan and be able to do
[1:14:57] battle against against the evil one
[1:15:02] so jesus said being found in the fashion
[1:15:03] of a man he humbled himself and he
[1:15:05] became obedient unto death even the
[1:15:07] death of the cross
[1:15:09] jesus came to serve brother brown says
[1:15:11] in one place
[1:15:12] when you live your life for others
[1:15:15] you're looking heaven in the face
[1:15:17] if you're living your life to benefit
[1:15:19] yourself if you're living your life to a
[1:15:21] mass of wealth if you're living your
[1:15:22] life to just kind of make everything
[1:15:23] comfortable for yourself and in some
[1:15:25] ways that's not necessarily bad but it's
[1:15:28] what is your focus
[1:15:30] but when you begin to live your life for
[1:15:32] others you see somebody else have a need
[1:15:34] and says
[1:15:35] here i i can do that and we supply them
[1:15:38] and sometimes we supply them when it
[1:15:40] hurts
[1:15:42] but they have a need and i have the
[1:15:44] ability to supply that need if i don't
[1:15:46] supply that need if the bible say if you
[1:15:48] see your brother have need and you don't
[1:15:49] and you don't help him out he says
[1:15:51] you're worse than an infidel or
[1:15:52] something to that that effect
[1:15:55] so if you have the ability to help
[1:15:57] someone help them
[1:16:00] go out of your way to try and help them
[1:16:03] because that's what jesus would have
[1:16:04] done
[1:16:10] in the rising of the sun brother branham
[1:16:12] says now notice that this quickening
[1:16:13] power zoe bringing the word the mind
[1:16:16] that was in christ was
[1:16:18] the mind that was in christ was in you
[1:16:21] then
[1:16:22] i'm trying to show you that you when
[1:16:23] when you raised when god raised
[1:16:26] when god raised jesus from the dead he
[1:16:28] raised you also
[1:16:30] and also quickened through life with him
[1:16:32] you you neither are quick into life
[1:16:34] although you
[1:16:35] although then you were but an attribute
[1:16:38] in this thought but god had saw you all
[1:16:40] in him in the feminine see when god
[1:16:42] looked down upon that body
[1:16:44] he said remember he went there with you
[1:16:46] in him see god had never separated the
[1:16:49] bride from the groom yet so when jesus
[1:16:52] so when god looked down upon the body of
[1:16:54] christ he saw both male and female
[1:16:57] it was all redeemed in that one body see
[1:17:00] they are all one same word the same word
[1:17:02] spoken speaks of the groom speaks of the
[1:17:05] bride
[1:17:06] and so he's saying here that when jesus
[1:17:09] christ hung upon the cross
[1:17:10] we were there in him
[1:17:14] well if we were in him then and he died
[1:17:16] upon the cross for the sins of the world
[1:17:18] that means he died on the cross for my
[1:17:20] sins because i was in him and that means
[1:17:22] this my sins was judged in him at that
[1:17:24] point in time
[1:17:27] in colossians 2 and 13 it says and you
[1:17:29] being dead in the sins and the
[1:17:30] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[1:17:32] quickened together with him having
[1:17:34] forgiven you all trespasses
[1:17:36] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:17:38] ordinance that was against that was
[1:17:40] against us which was contrary to us and
[1:17:42] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[1:17:44] cross
[1:17:47] when he was nailed to the cross my sins
[1:17:49] were nailed to the cross then
[1:17:52] and so once i have once i make a mistake
[1:17:54] i confess that mistake he's already paid
[1:17:56] the price and therefore the slate is
[1:17:58] clean
[1:18:00] it goes on revelation of jesus christ
[1:18:02] brother brown says but it's still not
[1:18:04] real to most people
[1:18:05] because the revelation about the spirit
[1:18:07] is not there the word the word has not
[1:18:09] been quickened the bible says in second
[1:18:11] corinthians 5 21 that we have become the
[1:18:14] righteousness of god by our union with
[1:18:16] jesus christ
[1:18:17] did you get it
[1:18:19] it says we are the very righteousness of
[1:18:20] god himself by being in christ it says
[1:18:24] that he jesus became sin for us it does
[1:18:27] not say he became sinful but he came sin
[1:18:29] for us that by our union with him we
[1:18:32] might become the righteousness of god
[1:18:35] if we accept the fact and we must that
[1:18:37] he literally became sin for us by his
[1:18:39] substitution for us then we must also
[1:18:42] accept the fact that we by our union
[1:18:44] with him have have become the very
[1:18:46] righteousness of god
[1:18:48] to reject one
[1:18:50] is to reject the other
[1:18:52] to accept the one is to accept the other
[1:18:57] he became our sin sacrifice
[1:19:00] he became the final payment for our sins
[1:19:03] he's the propitiation that means that
[1:19:06] the debt has been paid and so by being
[1:19:09] in him and the thing is they're in him
[1:19:12] by being in him we are the very
[1:19:14] righteousness of god that is how god
[1:19:16] views us
[1:19:18] god does not view us by ourselves
[1:19:21] god views us in him
[1:19:24] if we can begin to understand that we
[1:19:26] are that we by being in him that's all
[1:19:29] that god views
[1:19:34] this is me or us
[1:19:37] this is him
[1:19:44] that's all
[1:19:45] god
[1:19:46] sees
[1:19:50] brother branham says god hears our voice
[1:19:53] speaking
[1:19:54] through the blood
[1:19:56] so when we net when we bow our knees or
[1:19:59] however we pray and we begin to speak
[1:20:01] unto god it's not us
[1:20:03] it's us speaking through him
[1:20:05] and that's all he sees
[1:20:07] he hears our voice
[1:20:09] speaking to him and therefore he will
[1:20:12] hear us because we are the righteousness
[1:20:14] of god himself because we are in him we
[1:20:17] are we are part of him
[1:20:21] satan will tell you oh he said why would
[1:20:23] god hear your prayers
[1:20:25] i mean look at the life that you live
[1:20:28] look at the mistakes that you make
[1:20:31] oh do you remember the mistakes from
[1:20:32] yesterday oh yeah that was bad what
[1:20:35] about last week remember that incident
[1:20:38] last week
[1:20:39] oh yeah that was terrible oh and then
[1:20:42] you think you're going to pray to god
[1:20:44] and god hear you
[1:20:45] well man i guess not you know i mean why
[1:20:48] would god hear hear me being a sinner
[1:20:51] but i'm not a sinner
[1:20:54] i'm him
[1:20:58] you are the very righteousness of god
[1:21:00] himself
[1:21:02] because you are in
[1:21:04] him
[1:21:05] what did god do with adam and eve in the
[1:21:07] garden
[1:21:08] they sinned
[1:21:10] so what did god do
[1:21:11] he went looking for them for one and
[1:21:14] they were hiding in the bushes
[1:21:16] and god says oh you made a mistake
[1:21:19] okay
[1:21:20] things are going to change
[1:21:22] but then god went out and he found two
[1:21:24] animals he slew those animals and he
[1:21:26] took the sacrifices of those animals and
[1:21:29] gave it to adam and eve
[1:21:31] whenever god looked at adam and eve what
[1:21:33] did he do all he saw was the sacrifice
[1:21:36] he was reminded constantly the price for
[1:21:38] their sins had been paid for and now i
[1:21:40] can have fellowship with them
[1:21:42] and what did god do for us he slew he
[1:21:45] he hung up on the cross for my sins
[1:21:48] and so what did he do he clothed me in
[1:21:50] that sacrifice
[1:21:53] so now what does he do whenever he looks
[1:21:54] at me he has to see the sacrifice
[1:21:56] because i am in him and because i am in
[1:21:59] him i am the very righteousness of god
[1:22:03] god does not view me as a sinner
[1:22:06] you know one of the things when i was in
[1:22:08] baptist and pentecostal church
[1:22:10] you know we were they there was
[1:22:12] something they always emphasized
[1:22:15] he says you are a sinner
[1:22:17] saved by grace
[1:22:18] the emphasis you're a sinner
[1:22:21] you're no good rotten individual
[1:22:23] you sin every day you make mistakes
[1:22:25] every single day how do you think or
[1:22:26] god's going to look at you how are you
[1:22:28] going to never make it to heaven oh he
[1:22:29] says you're nothing but a sinner a sin
[1:22:31] or a sinner and you have to do this
[1:22:32] penance and that penance and you have to
[1:22:34] do this and you have to do that
[1:22:36] so you're always under condemnation
[1:22:39] oh lord i'm sorry i'm just a no good
[1:22:41] sinner but i have a need this morning if
[1:22:43] you could forgive me my little sins my
[1:22:45] you know and so there's always the
[1:22:47] condemnation
[1:22:49] but this message tells me something else
[1:22:52] you are a son and daughter of god which
[1:22:54] has been fully restored to your rightful
[1:22:56] position with your father because of the
[1:22:58] sacrifice that god did at calvary
[1:23:01] and if you can accept the fact that god
[1:23:03] that jesus christ died on the cross for
[1:23:05] your sins that your sins were nailed in
[1:23:07] the body of jesus christ as he hung up
[1:23:09] on the cross if you can accept that fact
[1:23:11] you are yes you are our sinner saved by
[1:23:13] grace
[1:23:14] but also you are a son and a daughter of
[1:23:16] god has been fully restored to your
[1:23:18] rightful position with your father
[1:23:21] and so whenever you go before god you
[1:23:23] don't go before him as a sinner saved by
[1:23:25] grace you go before him as a son and
[1:23:26] daughter of god that has been fully
[1:23:28] restored you are the very righteousness
[1:23:30] of god himself because you are in jesus
[1:23:32] christ you are a part of the godhead
[1:23:37] and that we have to be
[1:23:39] brother brown says
[1:23:41] if you if you're going to accept him as
[1:23:43] being your sacrifice
[1:23:45] then you have to accept that you're the
[1:23:46] righteousness of god
[1:23:48] if you don't accept that you're the
[1:23:50] righteousness of god
[1:23:52] then you're not believing in calvary
[1:23:55] that's kind of a flat statement but
[1:23:57] that's
[1:23:58] basically the way it comes down to
[1:24:01] so quit looking at yourself as a no-good
[1:24:03] rotten sinner
[1:24:04] realize you're living the flesh you make
[1:24:06] mistakes
[1:24:07] you will always make mistakes brother
[1:24:09] brown talks about you have a of
[1:24:10] nature
[1:24:11] so what happens is the will burn h
[1:24:13] will always cause you problems
[1:24:15] but he says inside of you there's a
[1:24:17] wheat
[1:24:18] inside of you there has been a
[1:24:19] transformation of your very nature that
[1:24:21] dwells within you and eventually that
[1:24:23] nature will begin to express itself
[1:24:26] brother brown says when you receive the
[1:24:28] holy ghost
[1:24:29] he says it comes in about the size of a
[1:24:31] button
[1:24:33] and he says what happens then you begin
[1:24:34] to get into the word you begin to get
[1:24:36] into the message you begin to get into
[1:24:37] prayer and what does it do it begins to
[1:24:39] grow and grow and grow and grow and as
[1:24:41] it grows it bid and begins to push out
[1:24:42] all the all the corruption and all the
[1:24:44] diseases and all of your sin and all of
[1:24:47] your sickness and all of your other
[1:24:48] things until eventually you become the
[1:24:50] very righteousness of god until event
[1:24:52] the bible says you are predestined to be
[1:24:54] conformed to the image of his son
[1:24:58] i will be
[1:25:01] because it's predetermined
[1:25:03] i mean that's what predestination means
[1:25:06] god has predetermined that i will become
[1:25:08] the very i will come into the very image
[1:25:10] of jesus christ
[1:25:12] there's a lot of work to be done
[1:25:14] i admit to that
[1:25:16] but yet god has predetermined that is my
[1:25:19] end
[1:25:21] but we're in the bright age
[1:25:23] we are in the time when god is going to
[1:25:25] so dwell within the bride until it's no
[1:25:27] longer her living but now is god himself
[1:25:29] living through her
[1:25:31] and we have to come into that we are at
[1:25:33] the end of the end
[1:25:35] i mean i'm
[1:25:37] people ask me you know
[1:25:38] i don't pay attention to the world
[1:25:40] really
[1:25:41] what i'm doing is i'm looking for my
[1:25:43] father and my mother and my brother to
[1:25:46] all of a sudden come and sit down have
[1:25:47] breakfast with me one day
[1:25:50] they've passed on sure
[1:25:52] but there'll be a resurrection
[1:25:55] and when there's a resurrection i expect
[1:25:56] them to come and knock on my door and
[1:25:58] say hey we have we want to have some
[1:25:59] breakfast wow all right and then i know
[1:26:02] 40 days later i'm going to become a
[1:26:04] young man again
[1:26:06] that's what i'm looking for but see
[1:26:08] we're there
[1:26:11] this is not a pipe dream
[1:26:13] this is not something in the far-off
[1:26:15] part you know whatever no this is the
[1:26:17] reality of the hour we are living in
[1:26:20] you look at what's going on in the world
[1:26:22] you know you know all those
[1:26:24] what's what russia is doing
[1:26:26] this is the fulfillment of scripture
[1:26:30] they're threatening to bomb us
[1:26:32] well first for the first one ever hits i
[1:26:35] get my change
[1:26:38] am i worried about the world events no
[1:26:41] because god is sovereign
[1:26:44] god is performing his will god is the
[1:26:46] one dictating the world events going on
[1:26:48] around us
[1:26:50] and what is he doing in the dictating of
[1:26:52] all these events he's making it so that
[1:26:55] the resurrection is um is upon us and
[1:26:57] all of a sudden the changing of my body
[1:26:58] is eminent and i'm looking forward to
[1:27:00] that
[1:27:02] i'm looking forward to being 120 pounds
[1:27:04] again
[1:27:05] i'm looking forward not to have some of
[1:27:06] the things that comes with aids
[1:27:09] but we're there
[1:27:12] really we are there
[1:27:19] in restoration of the bride to he said
[1:27:20] he says you will be a part of me
[1:27:22] you'll be my bride my life will be in
[1:27:24] your body but just like husband and wife
[1:27:26] as one person you and i are going to be
[1:27:29] one at that day you'll know i am in the
[1:27:30] father the father's in me i am in you
[1:27:32] and you and me oh i just love that jesus
[1:27:34] gets hate and gets so angry he says
[1:27:35] don't you see the oneness of god
[1:27:38] we are part of that godhead we are we
[1:27:40] are
[1:27:41] god god wants to take and so use his
[1:27:43] bride until the bride becomes a
[1:27:45] pro-manifestation of god himself
[1:27:49] brother branham in the masterpiece
[1:27:52] he says he says i'm using this in a
[1:27:54] parable now of the bride the masterpiece
[1:27:57] that's coming forth as the masterpiece
[1:27:59] fell there was a masterpiece rising the
[1:28:02] masterpiece fell at an icy rome
[1:28:05] after nia rome he said she's come she's
[1:28:08] come through a process
[1:28:10] but she is coming right back again into
[1:28:12] the masterpiece perfected
[1:28:15] because she's a part of that word that
[1:28:17] was spoken by him
[1:28:20] the church has gone through the church
[1:28:22] ages
[1:28:24] but now we're at the completion
[1:28:27] we're at the fulfillment of all of these
[1:28:29] things
[1:28:30] the process that began in the day of
[1:28:32] pentecost so the process began in
[1:28:34] niagara he says that that process is
[1:28:36] coming to its final end
[1:28:38] and we're part of that process
[1:28:41] we are part of the thing that all of a
[1:28:43] sudden we will become him
[1:28:45] literally we will become him he he will
[1:28:47] sow and dwell us until it's no longer i
[1:28:49] but christ now living and manifesting
[1:28:51] himself through me
[1:28:56] christ the mystery of god revealed oh if
[1:28:58] god can get him get him prisoners like
[1:29:00] that talking about paul
[1:29:02] now that's when he can express the
[1:29:03] preeminences you see
[1:29:05] he's got he's got the manner of the
[1:29:07] person so that he knows nothing but
[1:29:09] christ
[1:29:10] you get what i mean he says all right he
[1:29:13] said first he wanted to express himself
[1:29:15] completely god in christ that he
[1:29:17] succeeded
[1:29:20] how could god express himself through
[1:29:22] jesus christ
[1:29:24] jesus christ had to give up his will
[1:29:27] to do the will of the father
[1:29:29] he had to give up his ambitions
[1:29:32] to do the will of the father
[1:29:34] he had to give him all his desires
[1:29:37] to do the will of the father
[1:29:40] that's the only way that god could have
[1:29:42] the preeminence
[1:29:44] when that person becomes totally
[1:29:45] submitted unto the father that dwelt
[1:29:47] within him
[1:29:49] so second to have the preeminence by
[1:29:50] this in his church which is his body the
[1:29:52] bride till he could have the preeminence
[1:29:54] to express himself through them
[1:29:57] god can only express himself as we allow
[1:30:00] him to do that
[1:30:03] you can stop god
[1:30:06] do you realize that
[1:30:08] when god told me to go to charlotte and
[1:30:10] pray for the brother i could have said
[1:30:11] no i'm too busy
[1:30:13] traffic's too heavy i don't feel like
[1:30:14] going i don't want to do this
[1:30:17] and god never has a plan b
[1:30:20] moses you're going to lead him out
[1:30:22] but i don't want to go i don't care
[1:30:24] you're going anyway
[1:30:26] well
[1:30:27] i can't speak right okay aaron will be a
[1:30:29] prophet but you're going
[1:30:33] jonah
[1:30:34] god says i want you to go to nineveh
[1:30:36] i don't like those people
[1:30:38] i ain't gonna go
[1:30:40] i'll show you what i'm gonna do i'm
[1:30:41] gonna get in a boat and i'm gonna as far
[1:30:42] away from here as i can
[1:30:45] that cost him three days in a whale's
[1:30:47] belly
[1:30:49] and right after the fish vomited him out
[1:30:52] god says now will you go
[1:30:56] well
[1:30:57] okay
[1:30:59] he wasn't exactly a willing servant
[1:31:02] but yet he had to obey because god
[1:31:04] commanded him to god didn't say well
[1:31:06] okay you want to go fine i'll find
[1:31:08] somebody else to go no you are going
[1:31:11] well in today's world what is he doing
[1:31:13] he says you're going to go
[1:31:15] why is chad over in poland because god
[1:31:17] directed him to go
[1:31:19] why has he gone to other places because
[1:31:21] god directed him to go
[1:31:23] why did my wife i go to india because
[1:31:25] god directed us to go
[1:31:29] okay we're just trying to do god's
[1:31:31] bidding we're just trying to do what god
[1:31:33] instructs us to do
[1:31:34] but he has to have the preeminence
[1:31:38] you know it's interesting when i'm in
[1:31:40] india i realize i have no control
[1:31:44] i'm in the states i think i do
[1:31:47] i'm finding even in the states i don't
[1:31:51] we we went to uh
[1:31:53] arizona last year
[1:31:56] and i had my i had my
[1:31:58] bad habit i itemized i list everything
[1:32:00] i'm going to be here this day this year
[1:32:02] this day this day i'm going to minister
[1:32:03] here this you know i had all lined out
[1:32:05] for the whole month
[1:32:08] yeah we landed and i got a call
[1:32:10] you can't stay in the house that we're
[1:32:11] going to stay in
[1:32:13] because somebody else is in it
[1:32:16] oh
[1:32:18] so we go to
[1:32:20] plan b
[1:32:21] and then i was going to help my brother
[1:32:22] he had just bought a house and they were
[1:32:24] remodeling it and so i was going to
[1:32:25] visit with him on the saturday you can't
[1:32:27] stay here he says i'm called to minister
[1:32:29] on wednesday i've got to prepare
[1:32:32] all right
[1:32:34] scratch that plan so we did something
[1:32:36] else
[1:32:36] we get there and like every day changed
[1:32:41] every day changed
[1:32:43] but i had to learn to not rely upon my
[1:32:47] plan
[1:32:49] get up in the morning well lord here i
[1:32:50] am today what do you want done
[1:32:54] i make my plans and um we get a phone
[1:32:56] call and everything changes
[1:32:58] okay this wasn't important for me to do
[1:33:00] today this is what we're going to do
[1:33:01] today
[1:33:03] but it if if it wasn't the fact that i
[1:33:06] was willing to submit my will in that
[1:33:08] regard
[1:33:09] i would be very frustrated
[1:33:11] because my nature is to plan it
[1:33:15] in fact my pastor gets he jokes to me
[1:33:17] says
[1:33:18] you have the whole year planned out
[1:33:19] don't you
[1:33:21] well yeah don't you
[1:33:27] so it's a standing joke with us now
[1:33:29] anymore
[1:33:30] but but if we come to the place it's no
[1:33:32] longer what i want it's what does he
[1:33:34] want done today
[1:33:36] and thirdly he says to restore the
[1:33:37] kingdom to its right foot rightly
[1:33:39] position that fell uh that fell by sin
[1:33:42] and the first adam back there we're he's
[1:33:44] trying to get us back to the eden
[1:33:46] condition
[1:33:47] in christ the ministry of god of god
[1:33:49] revealed he says god expressed in jesus
[1:33:51] christ who was both father and son and
[1:33:53] holy ghost the fullness of the godhead
[1:33:56] bodily
[1:33:57] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[1:33:59] bodily dwells in his church
[1:34:01] the preeminence all that god was he
[1:34:03] poured into christ no the christ was
[1:34:04] he's poured into the church the
[1:34:05] believers
[1:34:06] and so now we have to begin to
[1:34:08] understand where does god dwell
[1:34:10] i'm looking at him
[1:34:13] literally i am looking at god
[1:34:17] because you are now the expression of
[1:34:19] him
[1:34:20] and the more you can yield yourself to
[1:34:22] him the more of him you can express
[1:34:25] but you have to be willing to yield
[1:34:29] you have to be willing to give up your
[1:34:30] will your desires and your you know
[1:34:32] everything
[1:34:34] until literally you can take yourself
[1:34:36] and put yourself in the hand of god
[1:34:39] and says lord here i am
[1:34:41] use me
[1:34:44] and mean it
[1:34:46] i mean the prophets some of them one one
[1:34:49] of the guys
[1:34:50] i think it was ezekiel all of a sudden
[1:34:52] um god says you're going to be an
[1:34:53] example to the people
[1:34:55] he says i want you to sit there and
[1:34:56] ration out your food but you're going to
[1:34:58] mix cow manure with it
[1:35:01] ah
[1:35:02] that doesn't sound appetizing
[1:35:05] and then what i think was isaiah he had
[1:35:07] to walk naked for about two or three
[1:35:09] years
[1:35:12] okay
[1:35:13] i mean some people might enjoy that but
[1:35:15] i don't think in that time it was a good
[1:35:16] idea
[1:35:18] but here again they were they had to do
[1:35:20] what god directed them to do
[1:35:23] anyway
[1:35:26] you know just because we only have a
[1:35:29] portion of the holy spirit
[1:35:31] does not limit the power
[1:35:33] that dwells within us
[1:35:36] we have electrical outlets
[1:35:39] those are connected to a fuse panel
[1:35:42] the fuse panel determines the amount of
[1:35:45] amperage
[1:35:46] that will flow through that circuit
[1:35:48] okay
[1:35:50] if it wasn't for that you plug something
[1:35:52] in there and you try and draw 40 amps
[1:35:53] out of that
[1:35:54] it'll pop you won't allow that
[1:35:58] okay but we are an outlet
[1:36:01] but see there's no fuse box
[1:36:04] god if god wants to flow through us a
[1:36:06] hundred percent
[1:36:08] let him flow
[1:36:11] you are the one that limits him
[1:36:14] you are the one that says no i can't do
[1:36:16] that.
[1:36:18] you're the one who says well lord that's
[1:36:19] more than i think i can handle today and
[1:36:22] let's let's plan it for another day no
[1:36:24] no god says i want you to do something
[1:36:26] and i wanted to do it now
[1:36:29] and he's expecting you to say okay
[1:36:31] where do you want me to go
[1:36:35] it says jesus christ the mystery he says
[1:36:37] what what was jesus manifested for
[1:36:39] to show god
[1:36:41] he was god
[1:36:42] he had to be no man could die no prophet
[1:36:45] could die he was god he he was the god
[1:36:47] of the prophets he was the prophets he
[1:36:49] was of the kings he was the history he
[1:36:52] says you know and and through and
[1:36:55] he was the history and and he was that
[1:36:57] was to come he there was this okay and
[1:37:00] through that and through that purpose he
[1:37:02] and through the purpose he achieved the
[1:37:04] church that he the fullness of god might
[1:37:06] bring to pass every promised word of god
[1:37:08] in these last days
[1:37:10] when he gets the preeminences the
[1:37:12] preeminence in the church to position
[1:37:14] his place within the church
[1:37:16] so god has to come to the we have to
[1:37:18] come to the place where we're willing to
[1:37:20] allow god to have the preeminence
[1:37:23] preeminence implies total control
[1:37:27] we were satan say i mean i said we gave
[1:37:30] satan the preeminences before
[1:37:33] why not give it to god this time
[1:37:36] why not allow him to rule and reign in
[1:37:38] our hearts and our lives
[1:37:41] because you're his sons and his
[1:37:43] daughters
[1:37:45] you were a part of him from the
[1:37:46] beginning and now he's wanting to use
[1:37:49] you to express himself through you
[1:37:52] it's not about you it's about him
[1:37:55] it's not what you do for him it's what
[1:37:57] you will allow him to do through
[1:38:00] you christ the commissioner of god going
[1:38:03] on now he sanctified or set apart for
[1:38:05] his purpose
[1:38:06] with his spirit and blood a church that
[1:38:08] he might that he might make every
[1:38:10] promise in this last day to be revealed
[1:38:14] he said that's the second fold of his
[1:38:15] threefold manifestation first to express
[1:38:17] himself in christ then express himself
[1:38:19] through the church
[1:38:21] and the same thing christ was the word
[1:38:23] and the church becomes the word when it
[1:38:24] lets the word go through them
[1:38:32] he said this is god's great mystery of
[1:38:34] love expressed
[1:38:36] that god and man
[1:38:38] became one
[1:38:40] see the whole thing is god and man one
[1:38:42] god and man was one there
[1:38:45] and god and man is one here see what it
[1:38:47] is being filled with the spirit him
[1:38:49] having the preeminences
[1:38:52] when we go into revelations chapter 3 14
[1:38:54] it says unto the angel the church of the
[1:38:56] ladies write these things saith the amen
[1:38:58] the faithful and through witness the
[1:38:59] beginning of the creation
[1:39:02] of god
[1:39:04] jesus christ was the beginning
[1:39:07] of that creation
[1:39:09] we are to be the
[1:39:10] final creation
[1:39:13] we are to be that final expression of
[1:39:16] god to this earth
[1:39:19] so as jesus was the beginning of the and
[1:39:21] how did he become that creation
[1:39:24] it talks about the dove and the in in
[1:39:26] the church and its condition brother
[1:39:28] brown says the dove and the lamb united
[1:39:30] together that's when god and man became
[1:39:32] one that's when heaven and earth embrace
[1:39:34] each other hallelujah that's when god
[1:39:36] was made flesh
[1:39:37] that's when god came down from the
[1:39:39] spirit form and was made man and dwelt
[1:39:41] among us
[1:39:44] so what happens when you receive the
[1:39:45] holy spirit
[1:39:47] when you were born you were sons and
[1:39:49] daughters of god
[1:39:52] then you accepted jesus christ as your
[1:39:54] savior
[1:39:55] and god began a work in your life to
[1:39:57] begin to mold you into his very image
[1:40:01] but then when you received the holy
[1:40:02] spirit what did you do
[1:40:04] that's when god and man became one in
[1:40:07] you
[1:40:09] that's when god so became in your body
[1:40:12] and he began to dwell in you then all of
[1:40:13] a sudden now just as jesus christ when
[1:40:15] the holy spirit came upon him in the
[1:40:17] river of jordan when you receive the
[1:40:18] holy spirit it's the same thing god and
[1:40:21] man is uniting together in you
[1:40:24] and from that point on then jesus was
[1:40:26] tempted in the wilderness but he and he
[1:40:27] came back but he always had to learn how
[1:40:29] to submit to the will of the father that
[1:40:30] dwelt in him brother branham somebody
[1:40:33] asked when god this was a trinitarian he
[1:40:35] said i used to pray for the father or
[1:40:37] whatever like that he says whom do i
[1:40:38] pray for now
[1:40:40] he says pray for the god that dwells in
[1:40:41] you
[1:40:46] have you ever tried to get away from
[1:40:48] yourself
[1:40:50] very difficult
[1:40:52] because everywhere you go you go right
[1:40:57] well if god dwells in you
[1:41:01] then wherever you go he goes with you
[1:41:04] so you can never get away from god any
[1:41:06] more than you can get away from yourself
[1:41:09] yeah if you sin all of a sudden brother
[1:41:11] ram says yeah then god goes off in the
[1:41:12] holy spirit he sits on a tree until you
[1:41:14] repent and stuff but basically you have
[1:41:16] to come to the understanding god is no
[1:41:18] further away from you than you are from
[1:41:20] yourself
[1:41:22] i mean i listened to somebody that they
[1:41:24] were having a class on how to pray i
[1:41:26] figured boy you're making it complicated
[1:41:30] i'm sitting driving my car and all of a
[1:41:32] sudden lord i have a need
[1:41:34] or somebody comes into mind well lord
[1:41:36] this person has a need lord would you
[1:41:38] manifest would you go and heal them or
[1:41:40] would you deal with them or would you
[1:41:41] help them
[1:41:43] and i just talked to
[1:41:44] him
[1:41:46] sure he's my father and i respect him in
[1:41:48] that position but still he's i mean he's
[1:41:50] my loving father here i'm his son
[1:41:54] so i just talked to him i talked to him
[1:41:56] like i talked to every to anybody
[1:41:58] anyway
[1:42:04] so it says it says it
[1:42:06] we're coming to a conclusion of the
[1:42:08] process we are coming to the place when
[1:42:09] god wants to so live in us until it's no
[1:42:11] longer us
[1:42:13] in revelation 10 7 but in days of the
[1:42:15] voice of the seventh angel and he shall
[1:42:17] begin to sound the mystery of god should
[1:42:18] be finished as he hath declared to his
[1:42:20] servants the prophet the mystery of god
[1:42:22] is christ dwelling in you
[1:42:25] that is the mystery
[1:42:26] in paul's day that was something
[1:42:29] for the for god to dwell in gentiles
[1:42:33] for god to dwell in people that were
[1:42:35] non-jewish for god to sit there and take
[1:42:37] people there were infidels and
[1:42:39] worshiping of idols and all of a sudden
[1:42:41] for god himself to go and humble himself
[1:42:43] enough to dwell in in sinful flesh ah
[1:42:46] this um this this was more than the
[1:42:48] people that they could understand
[1:42:51] but here but this is what the mystery is
[1:42:53] god's coming and dwelling within you
[1:42:55] because see it it takes it comes to the
[1:42:58] place
[1:42:59] where because in revelation 10 it goes
[1:43:02] on to down 8 through 11.
[1:43:04] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:43:06] spaking to me and said and go take the
[1:43:07] little book which is open so so that the
[1:43:09] seals have been opened at this point and
[1:43:11] the hand of the angel would standeth
[1:43:13] upon the seeing upon the earth so you
[1:43:14] don't go to the prophets you go to
[1:43:16] christ
[1:43:18] brother branham was not christ
[1:43:21] he was the prophet to this age god
[1:43:23] revealed things to the bride through him
[1:43:25] but he's not jesus christ he's not to be
[1:43:27] worshipped anyway and i went into the
[1:43:30] angel and told him give me the little
[1:43:31] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[1:43:32] it up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:43:34] but it shall be in their mouth sweetest
[1:43:36] honey i took the little book out of the
[1:43:37] angel's hand and ate it and it was in my
[1:43:39] mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i
[1:43:41] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[1:43:43] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[1:43:45] before many peoples nations tongues and
[1:43:47] kings
[1:43:48] this is after the messenger
[1:43:51] this is after the prophet
[1:43:53] we have a ministry we are to perform
[1:43:57] but it says john take the book
[1:44:02] take the book and eat it
[1:44:04] because you and the book have to become
[1:44:07] the same
[1:44:10] i think as god spoke to ezekiel
[1:44:12] ezekiel here's the scroll eat it
[1:44:15] he looked and says
[1:44:17] oh no he says everything in there is bad
[1:44:19] news for everybody
[1:44:21] and god says eat it
[1:44:23] because that is what you are going to
[1:44:25] tell
[1:44:26] everyone
[1:44:29] we eat this book
[1:44:31] we become one with the word and we begin
[1:44:34] to live that word
[1:44:37] and then we begin to prophesy we begin
[1:44:39] to tell others about the grace and the
[1:44:41] mercy of god
[1:44:42] until finally we're taken off the face
[1:44:44] of this earth
[1:44:46] brother brown says when the methodist
[1:44:48] failed god raised up others and so it
[1:44:49] has gone on through the years until on
[1:44:51] this last day there is again another
[1:44:53] people in the land who under their
[1:44:54] messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:44:56] final age he said yes sir the church is
[1:44:59] no longer the mouthpiece of god it's its
[1:45:01] own mouth so god is turning on her he
[1:45:03] will confound her through the prophet
[1:45:05] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:45:07] be in her
[1:45:10] not just the prophet
[1:45:12] in her
[1:45:15] yes sir for it says in the last days of
[1:45:17] revelations uh
[1:45:19] 17 the spirit and the bride say come
[1:45:24] this is where we are
[1:45:26] this is what god is trying to get us to
[1:45:28] understand we know that through the
[1:45:30] ministry of the prophet brother branham
[1:45:32] says he says god the the the wave sheath
[1:45:35] which was jesus christ was was waved
[1:45:37] over the people on pentecost
[1:45:40] but then in brother adam's ministry that
[1:45:42] same wave sheet which was jesus christ
[1:45:44] was waved over the bride
[1:45:47] the wave ceased is the first one that
[1:45:49] came to perfection the first one that
[1:45:51] came to maturity
[1:45:53] and so as it was waived over the day on
[1:45:55] pentecost that's what it's showing that
[1:45:57] he jesus christ when he rose from the
[1:45:59] dead he was the first one that actually
[1:46:01] showed he was a mature son of god he was
[1:46:03] the first one to come into completion
[1:46:06] but now he's waved over over the bride
[1:46:08] in this day what to see what it was
[1:46:09] trying to show he says as jesus christ
[1:46:12] was waved over over in pentecost he says
[1:46:15] now it's been waved over us what showing
[1:46:17] that the full word has been restored to
[1:46:19] us
[1:46:22] he's trying to tell us who we are
[1:46:25] he's trying to let us know that all the
[1:46:27] power that was in god now dwells within
[1:46:29] the church
[1:46:31] he's trying to tell us you're the very
[1:46:32] righteousness of god himself
[1:46:35] he's trying to show us that you have
[1:46:37] power over satan
[1:46:38] you have the right to sit there command
[1:46:40] satan to leave
[1:46:43] that power rests within you when jesus
[1:46:45] christ sent out the disciples two by two
[1:46:47] he says go into the cities and the
[1:46:48] villages is round about he says raise
[1:46:50] heal the sick raise the dead cast out
[1:46:52] demons i've freely given you the
[1:46:53] authority freely use it that has never
[1:46:56] been rescinded
[1:46:58] that still dwells in us
[1:47:01] that's still part of what we have the
[1:47:03] right to do by virtue of who we are as
[1:47:05] as the bride of jesus christ
[1:47:15] in uh
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:19] it's the rising of the sun
[1:47:25] as we waved again we realized in the
[1:47:28] last days according to luke 17 30 in the
[1:47:30] sun of in in the sun day again in the
[1:47:33] day when the sun of man will be revealed
[1:47:35] or waved again over the people
[1:47:38] he says in the different scriptures that
[1:47:39] we are acquainted with that the word
[1:47:41] again is waved over the people that the
[1:47:43] dead that the dead traditions of man is
[1:47:45] dead
[1:47:47] and the son of god is alive again with
[1:47:49] the baptism of the holy spirit right
[1:47:50] among us and is giving us
[1:47:52] life
[1:47:54] the bride is in the bride coming of
[1:47:56] christ coming out of the church there
[1:47:58] have to be a sheave waved over again in
[1:47:59] the last day and that's what happened in
[1:48:02] our generation
[1:48:09] in the bomb in gilead brother browner
[1:48:11] makes a statement
[1:48:13] he says the one thing we have to move up
[1:48:15] to now is supreme faith to what we've
[1:48:18] had something that you cannot have that
[1:48:21] faith until you know perfectly what
[1:48:22] you're doing
[1:48:24] when you understand like you you walk
[1:48:25] out and say well i'm going home i'm
[1:48:27] going out to start the car
[1:48:29] he said that's all an act of faith
[1:48:31] tomorrow i will meet you at a certain
[1:48:33] place it's all an act of faith because
[1:48:35] you've just done it so much because it's
[1:48:37] a regular routine with you
[1:48:39] well that's the way
[1:48:41] that well that's the way the things of
[1:48:43] god are
[1:48:44] after you have trusted him and watched
[1:48:47] him do so many things till it becomes
[1:48:49] like a regular routine
[1:48:52] and that's the condition i think the
[1:48:53] church will be in just before the coming
[1:48:55] of the lord
[1:48:56] so the raps will be just going right on
[1:48:58] that way it'll just be a regular routine
[1:49:00] of following the scriptures
[1:49:02] and the plan of god
[1:49:05] i did a study on havoc a couple years
[1:49:08] ago
[1:49:09] and that changed my whole concept of
[1:49:11] what it is to have faith
[1:49:14] faith is not believing for
[1:49:16] something
[1:49:18] it's believing in
[1:49:20] someone
[1:49:23] abraham had to believe that the god that
[1:49:25] had given him the promise had the
[1:49:26] ability to perform and bring that
[1:49:28] promise to pass
[1:49:31] he made a promise that
[1:49:33] that isaac he said all the promises to
[1:49:35] abraham rested in isaac
[1:49:38] so abraham when god told him i want you
[1:49:41] to take isaac i want you to take him up
[1:49:42] to the mountain i want you to kill him
[1:49:44] and reduce him to ashes
[1:49:46] abraham and said unto his servants he
[1:49:48] says mind my son we're going to go to
[1:49:50] the mountain
[1:49:51] and i and my son we're going to return
[1:49:55] he believed that even though his son was
[1:49:57] reduced to ashes
[1:49:59] god would raise him up because all of
[1:50:01] the promises of god to abraham rested in
[1:50:04] isaac
[1:50:06] he had to believe in god
[1:50:10] it didn't matter the circumstances
[1:50:11] didn't matter the conditions no he
[1:50:13] hadn't believed that god was in such
[1:50:15] control that god could do what god had
[1:50:17] promised that he would do
[1:50:19] god says he heals
[1:50:22] do you believe
[1:50:25] do you believe that he has the ability
[1:50:27] to fulfill his word
[1:50:30] if you have the ability to believe that
[1:50:32] that god that you serve that you worship
[1:50:34] that you adore if you can believe that
[1:50:36] that god has the ability to do what his
[1:50:39] what he's promised in his word then all
[1:50:42] you have to do is begin to claim that
[1:50:44] promise and then thank him for the for
[1:50:46] the manifestation of the fulfillment
[1:50:48] of that word
[1:50:51] we had i remember we were in one youth
[1:50:53] camp a while back
[1:50:55] and there was this young sister and she
[1:50:57] was there crying out and crying out and
[1:50:59] crying out and finally the minister
[1:51:00] which was there he went over to the
[1:51:02] sister and he says well sister
[1:51:04] he says what do you need from god and so
[1:51:06] she told him
[1:51:08] he said well sister instead of
[1:51:09] continually asking and begging
[1:51:13] he says start thanking him
[1:51:16] jesus says well
[1:51:19] okay
[1:51:21] and so she began to thank god for the
[1:51:22] fulfillment of a promise
[1:51:25] a little while later she was running the
[1:51:27] aisles because she was shouting she says
[1:51:29] god has answered my prayer god has taken
[1:51:31] care of the situation that i had in my
[1:51:33] life
[1:51:35] it was it's not we don't we are god's
[1:51:37] children
[1:51:39] we do not have to beg
[1:51:42] we are not beggars
[1:51:44] we go to our father and says father i
[1:51:46] have a need.
[1:51:48] okay
[1:51:49] we tell them what the need is
[1:51:51] well lord thank you for fear thank you
[1:51:53] for taking care of that need
[1:51:56] it may not be today may not be tomorrow
[1:51:57] but thank you god for fulfilling that
[1:52:00] promise
[1:52:01] when god appeared in in habakkuk i did
[1:52:03] this study in havacook
[1:52:05] god had taken habakkuk and he had showed
[1:52:07] him the condition of his world
[1:52:09] the priests were a bunch of hypocrites
[1:52:12] the economy wasn't wasn't was on the
[1:52:13] rocks everybody else was just doing
[1:52:15] their own thing and then nobody was
[1:52:17] worshiping god in sincerity and in truth
[1:52:19] and havoc told god he said why don't you
[1:52:21] judge these people
[1:52:23] because his righteous indignation rose
[1:52:25] up
[1:52:26] and god says yeah i think it's a good
[1:52:27] idea i'm paraphrasing obviously
[1:52:30] he said i'll send the chaldeans in
[1:52:33] oh no no no god that's not a good idea
[1:52:36] because they're not nice people
[1:52:38] they kill because they like killing
[1:52:40] when they come into this city they will
[1:52:42] kill anybody and everybody
[1:52:45] and so havoc all of a sudden had to
[1:52:47] wrestle with this
[1:52:49] and then havoc 2 and 4 it says behold
[1:52:51] his soul which is lifted up as not
[1:52:53] upright in him but the just shall live
[1:52:55] by his faith
[1:52:57] the soul which is lifted up the man who
[1:52:59] thinks he can do it on his own
[1:53:02] you think you can handle what's coming
[1:53:06] destruction is heading our way
[1:53:10] this nation is on is this nation's is in
[1:53:13] this nation is shot
[1:53:18] brother branham says
[1:53:19] god's going to send god
[1:53:21] you know he says god russia is going to
[1:53:24] send atomic bombs and blow up this place
[1:53:26] he said last thing he saw in the vision
[1:53:28] was america with nothing but a bunch of
[1:53:30] craters
[1:53:32] but we're going through economic
[1:53:33] problems right now
[1:53:36] we're going through all kinds of issues
[1:53:39] god was telling habakkuk he says he says
[1:53:42] you have to trust me
[1:53:46] you do not have the ability to handle
[1:53:48] what's coming
[1:53:51] so you will have to believe me that i
[1:53:54] will take care of you
[1:53:58] and to me this changed my whole concept
[1:54:00] it isn't i have to believe for something
[1:54:03] but i have to believe that the god that
[1:54:05] has called me the god that has directed
[1:54:07] my life the god that has supplied my
[1:54:09] needs i have to believe that he will
[1:54:11] continue to provide and he will continue
[1:54:13] to supply when we get sick i have to
[1:54:15] believe that he will heal me because
[1:54:17] that's his promise to me but it comes to
[1:54:19] the place where i have to totally rely
[1:54:21] upon him
[1:54:23] it's no longer me relying upon myself
[1:54:25] it's no longer me relying upon the
[1:54:27] things that i have ability to do it's no
[1:54:29] longer me relying upon what i think i
[1:54:31] can or can't can't do no it's learning
[1:54:33] to take my hand and put it in his hand
[1:54:36] and say lord i'm putting my hand in your
[1:54:38] hand don't let go
[1:54:40] because i need you to lead and guide me
[1:54:42] today
[1:54:45] and have a cook have to wrestle with
[1:54:47] this
[1:54:49] but then habakkuk 3 16 starting there
[1:54:54] he said when i heard my belly trembled
[1:54:57] my lips quivered at the voice
[1:54:59] rottenness entered into my bones and i
[1:55:01] trembled in myself that i might rest in
[1:55:03] the day of trouble
[1:55:04] when he when he cometh upon cometh up
[1:55:07] unto the people and he will invade them
[1:55:09] with his troops
[1:55:10] he was scared what was coming to his
[1:55:12] nation
[1:55:13] he was scared because judgment was
[1:55:15] coming
[1:55:17] he was scared because he knew that there
[1:55:18] was going to be an invasion of a foreign
[1:55:20] army and he knew when they came into
[1:55:22] that city he was afraid for his own life
[1:55:27] so he had to come to the place where he
[1:55:28] was going to take
[1:55:30] total reliance upon him
[1:55:32] upon god and but con god alone
[1:55:35] but then it goes on in verse 17 it says
[1:55:37] though the fig tree shall not blossom
[1:55:40] neither shall there be fruit in the
[1:55:41] vines and the labor of the allah shall
[1:55:43] fail
[1:55:44] and the fields shall yield no made in
[1:55:46] the flock shall be cut off from the fold
[1:55:47] and there be
[1:55:48] no herd in the stalls
[1:55:51] though there be nothing
[1:55:54] though he be reduced to absolutely
[1:55:57] nothing
[1:55:58] though there'd be no food in the land
[1:56:00] there would be no cattle no there would
[1:56:02] be nothing to buy there would be nothing
[1:56:03] to eat there would be absolutely nothing
[1:56:06] though everything he had be taken from
[1:56:08] him
[1:56:10] he goes that yet i will rejoice in the
[1:56:12] lord
[1:56:13] i will joy
[1:56:15] in the god of my salvation
[1:56:19] that verse is the strongest way that you
[1:56:22] could possibly put it in the hebrew
[1:56:23] language
[1:56:25] i will shout i will dance i will jump
[1:56:28] i will go into his presence with singing
[1:56:30] i will i will rejoice with him even
[1:56:32] though i even though i have absolutely
[1:56:34] nothing that will not change my my my
[1:56:37] desire to worship my god
[1:56:40] if he takes everything from me he says i
[1:56:43] will still worship god with my whole
[1:56:44] heart i will worship him as if i
[1:56:46] possessed everything
[1:56:50] and to me that's what brother brown when
[1:56:51] he talks about you know you have to have
[1:56:53] faith you have to have trust
[1:56:55] and that's the way he said the bride
[1:56:56] will be at the last day
[1:56:58] we cannot comprehend what's coming
[1:57:02] when california sinks as a result of an
[1:57:04] earthquake there will be a tidal wave
[1:57:05] that will go around the world and
[1:57:06] hundreds of millions of people will die
[1:57:08] in 20 24 to 48 hours
[1:57:12] our economy will go belly up
[1:57:15] there will be nothing
[1:57:18] at that point in time will you still
[1:57:20] come to church
[1:57:22] will you still worship god as if you
[1:57:24] possessed everything
[1:57:27] or do you worship god because it's
[1:57:28] comfortable
[1:57:30] i think one place in the scriptures that
[1:57:32] says if you can't serve god in the good
[1:57:33] times how are you going to serve him in
[1:57:34] the bad times
[1:57:36] if you can't run with a man what are you
[1:57:37] going to do and you have to run with the
[1:57:38] horses
[1:57:41] so it takes a commitment within
[1:57:42] ourselves
[1:57:44] what do we think about god is is god out
[1:57:46] of the center focus of our life is god
[1:57:48] the very one that we worship is god the
[1:57:50] very one that we have a desire for is
[1:57:53] our whole focus of our life focused upon
[1:57:55] jesus christ and him and him alone
[1:57:59] if we be reduced to nothing
[1:58:02] we still come and worship
[1:58:06] will it change our relationship with our
[1:58:08] father
[1:58:10] or begin to realize he is sovereign
[1:58:13] he knows what he's doing
[1:58:15] and all he's asking is for us to have
[1:58:17] the faith in him
[1:58:19] if the musicians want to come
[1:58:22] i'm closing this in philippians 3 12 to
[1:58:25] 14.
[1:58:27] paul writing not as though i had already
[1:58:29] attained either were already perfect
[1:58:32] but i follow after that i might
[1:58:34] apprehend that for which also i am
[1:58:36] apprehended of of jesus christ jesus
[1:58:39] paul was running a race he was in a
[1:58:41] struggle
[1:58:43] he says i haven't attained what god has
[1:58:45] called me to to become
[1:58:47] he says no he said he says he says but
[1:58:49] but i follow after i pursue something
[1:58:52] and i pursue something with all of my
[1:58:54] energy i pursue something with my whole
[1:58:56] heart
[1:58:57] he said brethren i count on myself to
[1:58:59] have have apprehended with this one
[1:59:00] thing i do forgetting with those things
[1:59:02] which are behind
[1:59:03] and i reach forth under the things which
[1:59:05] are before me i press towards a mark for
[1:59:08] the prize of the high calling of god in
[1:59:10] christ jesus
[1:59:12] and that's where we're at
[1:59:15] our economy is shot
[1:59:18] the world stage is getting to the place
[1:59:19] they're predicting a famine
[1:59:21] there's earthquakes everywhere volcanoes
[1:59:23] are erupting where they haven't been for
[1:59:24] quite a long while
[1:59:27] we have wars going with russia going
[1:59:29] into the ukraine they said that's going
[1:59:30] to devastate the world economy because
[1:59:32] of what
[1:59:33] of the different things
[1:59:35] it's going to make the price of our food
[1:59:37] go up it's going to make the price of
[1:59:38] our fuel go up
[1:59:40] it's going to make it so really we we're
[1:59:43] gonna
[1:59:44] there's a struggle ahead
[1:59:47] but during that struggle
[1:59:49] if your focus is jesus christ
[1:59:53] if your focus is having the relationship
[1:59:55] with god who is your father
[1:59:58] if you're having enough faith to believe
[2:00:00] that the god that has provided for you
[2:00:02] and healed you and taken care of you all
[2:00:04] of these years if
[2:00:05] you actually can come to the grasp of
[2:00:07] the fact and believe in that god
[2:00:10] to the place of no matter what happens
[2:00:11] tomorrow you will still worship that god
[2:00:13] you will still believe in that god and
[2:00:15] you'll have faith in that god to take
[2:00:16] care of you and supply your needs
[2:00:18] this is what habakkuk had to come to in
[2:00:20] his generation
[2:00:22] and i honestly believe this is what
[2:00:24] we're going to have to come to in this
[2:00:25] generation
[2:00:27] let's just pray
[2:00:31] heavenly father much has been said this
[2:00:33] morning
[2:00:35] and lord i have tried to express it from
[2:00:36] my heart and believe lord it was your
[2:00:38] words because lord i could tell you that
[2:00:41] they could say what the prophet said
[2:00:44] but lord i honestly believe that we are
[2:00:46] in the last days
[2:00:48] and there's going to come upon this
[2:00:50] nation something which we don't which we
[2:00:52] have no comprehension of
[2:00:55] but lord we are your bride
[2:00:58] in elijah's day you reserved seven
[2:00:59] thousand which had never bowed the need
[2:01:01] of baal
[2:01:02] you kept them
[2:01:05] and lord you have you have a bride you
[2:01:07] said the bride of today will not fall
[2:01:10] because you have preserved her you have
[2:01:12] followed her you have predestinated her
[2:01:15] we believe we are part of that bride
[2:01:17] lord
[2:01:18] and so lord now take what has been
[2:01:21] spoken
[2:01:22] and lord let it become a revelation to
[2:01:24] us in our hearts that lord of the things
[2:01:26] which are coming upon us we won't waver
[2:01:29] we won't fail
[2:01:30] but lord our focus will always be on you
[2:01:34] we sang this song turn your eyes upon
[2:01:36] jesus and all the things of the world
[2:01:38] will fade away
[2:01:39] and lord that's where our focus needs to
[2:01:41] be
[2:01:43] we need to look at you in such a way
[2:01:44] lord that the world and the things of
[2:01:46] the world mean nothing to us
[2:01:48] the lord you become our bridegroom
[2:01:51] and lord we are we just want to worship
[2:01:53] you we want to adore you
[2:01:56] we want to have an intimate relationship
[2:01:58] with you
[2:01:59] so grant that lord to me and to the
[2:02:01] people in front in front of me lord
[2:02:05] and lord be help us to have the
[2:02:06] revelation of who we are and what we are
[2:02:08] in you
