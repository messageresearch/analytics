us clear revision always consecrate ourselves to you and dedicate ourselves to this evening we pray you come Lord and take preeminence Among Us Show Yourself Lord unveil yourself to us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen while we're standing let's take our Bibles please and turn to Genesis chapter 32. we'll begin reading there I'm going to continue with the same portion of scripture in Genesis 32 talking about Jacob but I want to go into the next part Genesis chapter 32 and we'll begin reading in uh verse 9 what does Sarita passage of scripture there verse 9. and Jacob said o God of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord which said unto me return unto thy country to thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee I'm not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of the truth which thou has showed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over this Jordan now I am become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with children let's go over to verse 24 now verse 24 and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the break of day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breakth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou Dost asked after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh man God bless you as you take your seats may the Lord bless us this evening as we look into this subject I want to I want to look into this phrase in verse 27 I believe it is yeah in verse 27 he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed it's amazing that the struggle is all about a name when you really get down to the heart of the struggle amen you have to say that that this Angel presented himself to Jacob Jacob didn't find the man to wrestle with the man presented himself to Jacob and there we know that it was it was God in a form it was a manifestation of God because he says he names the place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and so brother Adam tells us he wrestled with God it was God in a theophany God and a a form of a man that began an angel began to wrestle with him and and the the angel could not Prevail over Jacob and this is amazing because you think God in a form he was wrestling with God God could not Prevail and it wasn't that God didn't have enough power or enough strength or could not equip this angel with enough power to Prevail that he could not Prevail over Jacob because there was a promise that had to come forth in Jacob's life he could not Prevail over Virginia Jacob because Jacob needed to win this battle Jacob needed to be changed amen so I want to jump over to another scripture and look at Hosea together if you look at Hosea with me Hosea chapter 12. and Hosea is going to reference the same thing here Hosea chapter 12. and we're going to look at verse 3. I'm sorry yeah Hosea chapter 12. and verse 3. it says in Isaiah 12 and 3 he took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strength he had power with God yea he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication into him he found him at Bethel and there he spake with us so I want you to see it says in verse 3 that by his strength he had power with God yea he had power over the angel and prevailed amen Hosea is is saying that Jacob had power with God and he had power over the angel and he prevailed I think this is a fascinating portion of scripture amen who can get into a wrestling match with God in the form of an Angel and when amen only the one that's predestinated to win that's the only one that can win the only one that has an order in his life to win the one that God in in this instance God did not want to Prevail over Jacob God wanted Jacob to Prevail God wanted Jacob to persevere God wanted Jacob to hold on God wanted Jacob to go all the way amen and he went all the way until he got a name change amen and a walk change and everything changed I believe that was the goal of God so now when this Angel comes you realize that that God decided to meet Jacob here Jacob didn't find a place where God was he didn't come and knock on his door that he was alone and God came to Jacob and when God came to Jacob then there was a struggle that ensued amen and and on God's perspective from the Angel's perspective it had everything to do with changing Jacob and and he wrestled and he says let me go and he says I will not let you go and and he touched the the hollow of his thigh and it shrank and and he we know he changed his walk amen and he weakened him in the flesh and and then he says what is your name and he said Jacob he says listen it's not that God didn't know his name this is the central part of the story is the name and that's what I want to get into so if we're a title tonight I've taken thy name shall be called No More Jacob thy name shall be called No More Jacob to this point he was supplanter he was deceiver he was working by his plan by his strengths by by his abilities everything that he was gaining or trying to gain or accomplishing was on his own but here he was going to come face to face with God he was going to come in contact with something brother bam said something real that he could get a hold of and when he did this Angel asked him what is your name or other words he says what is your identification who are you who are you it's like when God come walking in the in the cool of the evening into the Garden of Eden after the fall of Man he cries Adam Adam Where Art Thou it's not that God doesn't know where Adam is but God needs Adam to know where Adam is amen and and so Adam then begins to tell him well I I heard thy voice walking in the in the garden and I hid myself for I was naked he had to declare what condition he was in he had to declare where he was with God and now the angel asked Jacob who are you and he says I'm sir planter I'm deceiver I'm Jacob and he's going with his carnal identification with the carnal identification he's had all of his life that's all he knows about himself that's all he knows is who he is so he gives the best answer he can but the angel said thou shall no more be called Jacob thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel let's read that I'm going to go back to Genesis and I want to stay there for a minute Genesis 32 this has become so significant to me as I look into this verse 27 chapter 32 verse 27 he said unto him what is thy name he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob listen this isn't a suggestion he wasn't saying what do you think about a new name what do you think if I if I called you Israel would you be okay with that the angel is making a declaration I've met you you've reached out and got a hold of me and now I'm going to bless you he asked him he says well he says I will not let you go unless you bless me so what is the blessing the blessing is what's your identification say Jacob no more are you going to be called by Jacob but you're going to be called by Israel what is he giving him he's giving him the blessing but it comes in a unique way he's saying bless me and it's not like when when Israel when when Isaac gave him the blessing he gave him the blessing of the fat of the land and the corn and all his Brethren Shall Serve him he gave him a blessing of material things but now in the presence of the Angel he asks for a blessing and here's how the angel gives a blessing what are you called who are you what's your identity and he said my identity all I've ever known is Jacob he says you shall no more be called Jacob but Israel but Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and Hast prevailed overcome you have overcome oh my goodness that is so amazing to me ah brother Franco if you could pull up the white board I want to write a few things down but I want to read something here brother REM said out of the breach he said like Jacob being supplanter and when he got in contact with the angel he held on and the angel tried to pull away he said I'm just not going to let you go he held on until he got what he wanted for and his name was changed from Sir planter which means deceiver to what to a prince with God Israel he prevailed brother remember says in Victory Day what what the church needs to do is to do like Jacob pray till you get a v-day and right Jacob had a wrestling party he wrestled all night long with the Lord but he said I'm just not going to let you go until I get this Victory and then about daylight one morning he had a v-day he didn't walk the same anymore his victory his Blessing was uh to be humbled In the Flesh or to be weakened in the flesh but to be given a new identification what a blessing what kind of blessing do we want amen what kind of blessing are we looking for when we say God would you bless me is it with Supernatural powers and with all kinds of gifts and with great ministry and a great name amen maybe the blessing we need is to recognize how weak we really are to be weakened in the flesh but to get a new identity amen so I want to I want to write down some of these definitions of the word Israel because it's it's a very interesting a word Israel now in the Strong's Concordance it says God prevails that's the definition they give God prevails in the Scofield bible which is the one brother Branham read it says Prince with God all right so Strong's Concordance uh which is the concordance that's part of the table the old table says God prevails in Schofield Bible it says Prince with God but then when you look at it I went on and I started looking at a lot of different sources for the definition as mean the meaning of this word it's actually quite a complex word it's not a simple word it's actually a combination of three words and it's and it's it was described as a sentence and a word and and the other if you look at other uh concordances and other uh translations it's it is translated let me see here wrestles with God or struggles with God here when it's used this way the center part of this word right here is is is a word that can be a noun or a verb as it's a noun it means Prince or ruler right so as a noun it's Prince or ruler but as a verb it means to fight to wrestle to struggle to contend all right same word and so it it all of these translations are correct so I'm not saying one's right and one's wrong I'm saying the usage of the word if you understand the word it's a very complex word and when we start with with the first part of Israel which this is an English translation this isn't Hebrew but this first part is basically he so he is a prince and L the last part is short for Elohim or God so he is a prince with God or he wrestles and struggles fight with or contends with God and most of the concordances and most of the translations uses it as a verb amen and that and that's a um uh that's that's how it's translated even by the Jews it's it's a verb wrestles with struggles contends because that's what a prince or a leader or a king does Amen they fight for the people they they wrestle they fight and they contend so I want to I want to look at all of these and I don't want to Discount any of them they're all good they're all true they're all accurate and I want to talk about how they all are accurate so if you look at the first one in the Strong's Concordance when it says God prevails amen do you really think that God wanted to beat Jacob in a wrestling match you think that's God's Great goal in life if I could just go down and wrestle I bet I could pin him to the Ground God wasn't wrestling Jacob to win amen he wasn't wrestling Jacob to show that he had more power obviously God when he comes in a form of an Angel has more power than than a human being with with muscles and and send you and tendons and all of those things that's not what this is all about this is all about there's a seed inside of Jacob there's something locked within Jacob there's a potential laying there that's in that was in God's mind before the foundation of the world and God has to get that potential out amen and he's got to meet Jacob in a time of desperation because Jacob has been going along living his life accomplishing his things getting the blessing and getting the birthright going and struggling with Laban Amen to overcome and Laban gets the best of him and the wife and and then he gets the best of him with the cattle and then he changes this way it's a it's a battle back and forth in the flesh trying to gain and trying to do all that he's doing but there's something else laying in Jacob God knows he's not a supplanter amen he's my seed amen so God in a time of desperation when when Jacob is desperate when Jacob is weak and Jacob is all alone and he's come to the end of his ability amen God steps on the scene and presents himself to Jacob and begins and Jacob gets a hold of him because now Jacob's in desperation and there's something in Jacob that knows there's something in this man that can bless me why why else would he hold on until he says I will not let you go unless you bless me that means Jacob knew that this Angel this man could bless him amen how did he know I don't know how he knew but he knew and it must have been the knowledge that was locked in the seat on the inside of him that he knew that if I ever going to be blessed if I'm ever going to get out of this this vessel right here is the one that's going to help me and he got a hold of it and he said I will not let you go except you bless me amen and now there's a struggle amen there's a fight Amen in in the end God Amen touches amen Jacob and weakens Jacob to where he changes Jacob's walk and changes Jacob's life from then on Jacob is never the same and then he gives him a new identification you shall no longer be called Jacob but Israel it looked like Jacob won that battle but who really won God won God prevailed God had the victory God Amen God wanted to be apprehended amen God wanted to be gotten a hold of God wanted to be stopped in his tracks God wanted to be cried out to he wanted somebody that would hold on to him and not let go until they got the blessing amen and God gave him the blessing amen of a name change amen so the first uh the first definition is absolutely accurate God prevails it looked like Jacob prevailed but God prevailed amen there's so many things in the in the scriptures that we could go to and we're going to go to it here in just a minute but it's absolutely the truth amen it it wasn't the feeble little human being of Jacob that was defeating God it was God defeating Jacob amen it was God having the victory over the Flesh of Jacob so that what Jacob really was which was God down on the inside could come out and display the characteristics that were trapped inside which were what an attribute of God so who won God won I ask you has God ever lost Amen in the Garden of Eden amen God knew that they would fall right and so he made a way in which they could fall and left him on free moral agency to facilitate the fall but never making them fall and never was at his perfect will that they would fall but knowing they would fall because he had a plan of redemption in which he would show his attributes and this was the only way he could show his attributes so when the fall came it looked like God lost but did God lose no God won because it all worked according to his plan so God doesn't lose now this word Prince with God I mean it's an interesting word Prince it it means ruler it means a like a governor or a ruler a prince or a princess a somebody who's in charge amen and he calls him Israel let's look back here at verse 28 he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed this word power here in verse 28 thou Prince hast thou power with God that power is the same word amen that's translated wrestle struggle strength it's a verb it's used here as a verb and it's translated other places as to contend to contend with to wrestle to struggle to fight all right and so what is he saying because as a prince thou has power with God as a prince thou wrestles and struggles and contends with God really strange really really strange because initially we would say that's bad you're struggling and contending with God that's bad and I'll say no that's good that is good amen and I I hope that that God will help me and give me the ability to share what's on my heart so that by the end of this we'll realize that to fight with to struggle with to contend with to wrestle with God Is Not a Bad Thing it's a good thing amen oh I don't forgive you for being quiet just wait and see amen just sit still and see hey man how this goes brother Benham said in the message seed is not air with the shuck he says politics voting and voting out saying this that or the other and the Holy Spirit has no more right-of-way in the church than nothing no more power no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with God to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever brother Bam's talking about the modern condition of the church that has cooled off and got lazy and he says there's no more agonizing with God to fulfill his word brother Bannon was but saying that that agonizing with God was a good thing what is that that's agonizing deploring God Amen uh pouring out your supplication to him amen contending with him and wrestling with God for God to keep his word and the church had got lazy and they got lots of days ago and everything would be fine and amen but no more were they agonizing with God to keep his word amen but the church the first church that believed that word amen they would pound on God's door and pound on God's door amen knowing that this word is true and God will keep his word and they would agonize with God what were they doing struggling with God foreign amen amen and I say God liked it because brother branham's condemning the loss of that he's saying it's got cold and formal and they've and the church has lost that Israel is a unique people Jacob was changed his name was changed to Israel and then that became the name of the chosen people of God the whole family then we're called Israel the nation of Israel Israelites amen and and here you have in this title this thing that has to do with ruling and contending and struggling amen with God and and there are special people to God they're those that are are ruling amen you would say with God or in conjunction with God they have power with God they can Prevail it's it's this is an interesting name in this way because this is not the kind of relationship where we think about God and his people and that kind of relationship God is here the people are here God says the people do there's no question is that right there's no question there's no dialogue there's no discussion God says it we do it God says it we do it but you'll find as God's dealing with his people it's not that kind of relationship that God is calling out a people and this is the kind of people that will talk back to God and say God I mean he called out Abraham and when he called out Abraham Abraham would would enter into a relationship with God God wasn't wanting to be the distant deity that gave out decrees and the people like ten soldiers obeyed he wanted a relationship with a people that would discover him that would learn about him that would hold on to him that would turn him that would call him on the scene he wanted a different kind of people a different kind of relationship and he shows it in the name Israel this is what he's looking for he calls Abraham and he tells Abraham hey I've heard the cry against Sodom and I'm going down to investigate I'm going to destroy Sodom and then and God is walking down uh the road not the road but wherever they're walking they're walking and the planes of memory amen going over to the precipice of the hill to look down maybe upon amen the valley where Sodom is and he says can I keep anything from Israel or from Abraham why because he was the friend of God the Bible said he was a friend of God and God wasn't he wasn't interested in the distant deity he wasn't interested in the decreeing God and the obeying people he wants obey obedience but what he really wants is a people who will know him people who will discover him people who will cry out to him he wanted a relationship with the people he wanted them to be his people and he wanted to be their God and then Abraham then would say uh what if there's 50 righteous people who's he talking to he's talking to God who created the heavens and the Earth God who's perfect in everything he says God who's perfect in all of his ways and now he begins to say um would you destroy that far be it from the god of righteousness to do a thing like that it takes most of our ideology about God and we have a nuclear meltdown when we look at this conversation because with our idea and Concepts about God and people it's like we're ants and and he's this Mighty Giant and he just crushes us at will and that's not what God wants that's not his imagery that's not his desire remember Abraham didn't come to God God came to Abraham because God wanted Abraham and he wanted Abraham to separate himself from everything so that God and Abraham could be friends amen and a friend Jesus even tells his disciples I'll no longer call you servants amen but friends for the servant doesn't know what his master doing amen but the friend knoweth amen now Jesus is telling them I do I'm not looking for servants I'm looking for friends oh there's a lot in this name Israel amen your servant can't say much to you but your friend can ask you a lot of questions amen and now Abraham says now why what if there's 45 and what if there's 40 and and what if there's 30 and and what's he doing he is contending with God he is interceding for some God has already said I've heard the Cry The Cry is great I'm going down I'm going to destroy it God's already spoke you think God spoke that's it I buttoned my lip I don't say anything more that's not the way it works in the Bible he says God of all Heaven and Earth wouldn't do a thing like that he says all spirit for 40. would you spare it for 30 would you spare it for 25 would you spare it for this and that and he gets down here and and Abraham says let me see if I can find it yeah Abraham says behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord per Adventure there shall be 20 found there and he said I will not destroy it for 26. he said oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this once per Adventure 10 shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it for Ten's sake and the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communion with Abraham and Abraham returned to his place God was in he was in entering session he was in Abraham was contending for a lot and he was asking God what about this and what about that and what about this he wasn't just saying oh well whatever will be will be no he's getting a hold of God and he's saying he's in a special relationship with God where he can say God why would you do this if there's 50 that wouldn't be right to do that would it that doesn't seem according to your nature that doesn't seem according to your word why would you do that amen and God says well I'll spare it for 50 and then he keeps going all the way down until God leaves off talking to Abraham and walks away because he can't go any lower amen God I would I this is Brother Chad I could be wrong but it looks to me like God wants a people that will contend with him that God wanted a people and he gave the name to Jacob when Jacob wrestled with God he says and and Jacob wanted a blessing this is your blessing amen watch your name you're not a supplanter you're not a deceiver amen you you're a wrestler with God you're a prince with God you've got power with God and with man that power with God means you're a wrestler a fighter a struggler a contender with God you're in a special relationship you're one of the few that can talk to God and implore God amen and that was Israel those were his people and that was the relation that's the name that he gave to Jacob that changed Jacob's identification and Jacob began to realize amen that now I'm not just oh my goodness I'm not just a nobody I'm not just a roused about I'm not just a deceiver grabbing things through deception but there's something more to me than what I ever thought and this Angel when he blessed me he blessed me with an identification that gave me power with God oh my goodness it is wonderful Jesus tells us the parable of the unjust judge and in Luke chapter 18 he begins to tell his disciples in verse 1 and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me in my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow troubles me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me listen listen this is Jesus giving this story and he's teaching the disciples a lesson something he wants them to learn and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him though he bear along with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth he's talking to the disciples and and to me if it was me I wouldn't have used that example I wouldn't have used an example where you constantly knock on the door where you're constantly ask and and you constantly are bothering the judge until the judge finally grows weary of your constant bothering and he gives you what you're wanting I if it was me writing the Bible I would have never wrote that story that way because in my religious Notions and my religious upbringing I would have said don't bother God just say God if it's your will I have this I'll have it if not I'm not and leave it alone and don't ever say anything else about it because I had the Ant and the giant concept of me and God growing up all of my life now God was here and I was down here but that's not what God wants God was constantly lifting his people up and bringing them into dialogue with himself praise be to God brother bear said in the message be not afraid of his eye says that's right friend you know prayer changes the mind of God this is so interesting because he's going to say the exact opposite here in a few minutes that's right friends you know prayer changes the mind of God God sent a prophet up to a man one day and said he said set your house in order you're going to die he turned his face to the wall and prayed earnestly and said Lord I beseech you to consider me I've walked before you with a perfect heart I need 15 years and look like God would have spoke right back to the king he was the biggest man in the country but he speaks to his prophet he told Isaiah go back and tell him I heard and I'm going to spare his life I I believe it was King Hezekiah amen Isaiah come and gave him the word of the Lord the word of the Lord says this he turned his face to the wall and began to contend with God he began to ask for more time and begin to tell God why he needed more time amen and God stopped Isaiah and brother Branham dramatizes it you know Isaiah he goes up and delivers the word and all the the heads of state heard it and he's walking across the courtyard and God says go back and he's like go back I just they all heard me tell him go back go back and tell him that I heard him and I'll extend his life then brother Branham comes and the message does God ever change his mind about his word he said God don't change his mind he stays right with his word prayer changes the mind of God but God's mind never changes that's a good one I'm not gonna write nothing down I don't even know what to write down prayer changes the mind of God but God's mind doesn't change this is so wonderful it's so mind-boggling on a human perspective on a carnal understanding of making one plus one always equal two but when you go a little higher into the Realms of God Amen it starts to paint a picture that's absolutely wonderful he says and the message does God change his mind he says you know we can change our mind because we learn a little different we know we are wrong but I don't believe that God can change his mind because if he does then he certainly could not be infinite and he could make a better decision if he would change it the faith that I have in him that he doesn't change his mind because it if God ever makes a decision he has to stay with that decision is that right now when brother Brandon preaches this in these several messages he says this in 1965 he's preaching about Balaam coming back to God after getting God's perfect answer the first time and God comes back and Balaam comes back to God and then God gives him his permissive will not his perfect will he gave him the perfect will the first time and he goes out in the permissive will amen and that's what brother branham's talking about here when God gives his word he doesn't change his mind but before when God is when brother Ben I'm speaking in several other places he's telling us that Prayer Changes Things prayer changes circumstances prayer changes the mind of God and he said God wants you to cry out for what you want he said that's how a baby gets What It Wants just cried he said you cry and he says the Bible says seek and you shall find knock on the door will be open not seek once knock once but keep seeking keep knocking until the doors open keep crying till when brother Ben he says until you get what you desire so on one hand he's saying contend with God and and change God's mind on the other hand he's saying God never changes his mind I love the Bible let's go to Exodus 32. Exodus 32. and verse 9. Exodus 32 and 9. and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-neck people let now therefore now therefore let me alone that my wrath May Wax Hot against them and that I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nation so God says leave me alone and let me get angry and let me wipe them out and start over with you great that's the word of the Lord verse 11 and Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why the thy wrath Wax Hot against thy people which which thou has brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say for Mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountain and to consume them from the face of the Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people what is Moses doing he's struggling with the Lord he is wrestling with God he's contending with almighty God he said remember listen to them remember Abraham this is how God should speak to his children not his children speak to him remember Isaac and Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to whom thou swearest by thine own self and says unto them I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people prayer changes the mind of God God's mind never changes which is it I say it's both because the ultimate plan of God God wasn't going to wipe out those people and start over with Moses amen God here's what brother Branham said and the message Look Away to Jesus from 1963. he said there was another one that puzzled me that was when Moses could tell God a better way than God know how to do anything then Moses said the people will say your God was able to bring you out but not able to keep you and Moses threw himself in the breach then later I found out that that was Christ and Moses standing for the people it wasn't Moses amen it was another part of God in Moses God was contending with God and that's what was happening when Jacob wrestled with the Lord amen it was a part of God wrestling with the part of God God was trying to break through the shell of humanity and bring out the virtue to bring out the life that was trapped inside and now in Moses Moses is playing Another Part amen God's not changing his mind I mean what God is doing is God is laying out his drama God is needing an intercessor God needs somebody Amen to contend with him so that he can manifest himself that's why God Amen from the best I can see in the scripture God did not want this relationship of the the the the the distant deity that's so far away we can never contact him or talk to him we just make sacrifices and hope he's nice to us that's what the pagans had amen but that's not what God wanted amen it wasn't this ah you know I'm God and you you just appease me appease me appease me no he wanted this friendship he wanted this relationship he wanted a people to say God why are you doing this your word says this why don't you why don't you honor your word and stick with what you said the first time hahaha amen why because what's he Desiring to do he's Desiring to manifest himself he's Desiring to manifest what's inside of him amen and he needs a people amen that can stand Toe to Toe with him and say God but your word says I don't understand the situation in my life because your word says that by your stripes I'm already healed and your Prophet came and demonstrated it over and over again why Lord do I have to stay in this condition when your word says you know what God wants God wants somebody that'll act like Israel [Music] God wants a people amen that will that will that will contend with him that will agonize with God to keep his word why so that he can display himself so that he can manifest his word amen somebody has to act the other part amen he's acting one part somebody's got the act the other part so that he can display himself so on one level it looks like God changes his mind and let's just say and the carnal understanding of man God changes his mind and the higher understanding of God he's never changed his mind he's fixed his plan he knows the end from the beginning everything's ticking right on time nothing's out of cater all these things have to be this way amen but from man's perspective it looks like God can change his mind but what God wants to do is display himself when he comes in as a judge he needs somebody to be an intercessor amen praise God I'm going to look at this in another story let's turn to first Samuel chapter 25. I tell you friends this little study on the name Israel has just been so enlightening to me it Has Lifted Me into a new place whatever your identity has been in this earth it's wrong when you come forth from Human parents and you were born in an Earthly natural way and you were given a name and and you know brother Branham said in the last message you preached he said it was a great day when I realized I wasn't the son of Charles and Ella Branham he realized he was something other than that that's how this flesh came into existence but down inside he said there was another William Branham amen there was something there was a real me there was a genuineness to who God intended me to be amen and it was locked into this vessel because God wanted to use this vessel to display himself amen but we had to come to a realization I'm not I'm not what my birth certificate says I am I am something else amen there is another certificate called a marriage certificate and it was sealed in heaven before the foundation of the world and it holds my true identity and that true identity means that there was a part of me that has always been with God Amen that was with God before the foundation of the world that God wanted to be expressed in this vessel of clay for this day so that he can express himself amen and what he needs he needs a vessel amen not not somebody who's going to stay bashful and somebody who's going to stay apathetic and somebody who's going to stay lethargic but he needs somebody who's going to actively produce his word by saying God your word says God your word says God your word says then I believe it and I believe you're not a man that you should lie but you're God and there is no lying in you and if you bore stripes on your back for my healing then it's my healing it's already paid for amen God needs somebody that'll get a hold of him when he comes by so that why so that he can display himself we we so much in religious worlds I don't when I say me I don't mean just are we I don't mean just us sitting here but in the religious worlds of Christianity we get we get such poor ideas and and we just think God's going to do everything and the reality is if anything's going to be done it's going to be God that does it but is it going to be amen God there or God here which God's going to do it that's the question amen which God which part of God which attribute which expression we could say which part of God's going to do it amen maybe the part that's in here is the one that needs to get an action amen maybe amen maybe there needs to be a calling Jesus on the scene amen because G a part of Jesus the part of the life of Jesus is dwelling in here amen oh praise God let's look at first first Samuel 25. verse 2. and there was a man in Mayon whose possessions were in Carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep and caramel now the name of the man was nabel and the name of his wife Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was the of the House of Caleb so this is the story of Naval and Abigail and David but it's just so beautiful I want to look at this together let's go down to verse 21. now David had said surely in vain hath I kept all this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missing of all the pertaineth unto him and he had to requited me evil for good David sent down some young men to tell him hey we've been protecting you now we need some food would you share some of your Bounty with us because we've been keeping you from Raiders you've been prospering under our care and nabel said no I have nothing to do with David called him a rebellious servant and sent him back so David goes down he straps on his sword to go down and kill nabel and that's where we are in the story in verse 22 so and more also do God unto the enemies of David if I leave of all that pertain to him by the Morning Light any that pisseth against the wall and when Abigail saw David she hastened and lighted off the ass and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground amen when when the young when the when the young men left and nabel sent them away there was a servant that went to Abigail and told her what did what nabel had done to David and she quickly gathered up all that she could grab a hold of and then laid in them Onassis and began to take him out to meet David and listen to the dialogue this is what I want us to catch is the conversation she has with David verse 24 and fell at his feet and said upon me my Lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thy handmaid I pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid let not my Lord I pray thee regardless man of Belial even nabel for as his name is so his nabel so he so as he enabled is his name and Folly is with him Nable means a fool here's a man with a name and he's playing the role of his name Jacob was playing the role of his name that's why he needed a new name nabels playing the role of his name he's a fool and says so as he enabled as his name and Folly is with him but I thine handmaid Saul not the young men of my Lord whom thou did send now therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth and as thy Soul liveth seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and then they seek evil to my Lord be as Nable and now this blessing which thine handmade hath brought unto my Lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my Lord I pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house because my Lord fighteth the battles of the Lord and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God and the soul of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling and it came to pass when the Lord when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offense of heart unto my Lord either that thou has shed blood causeless or that my Lord hath Avenged himself but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my Lord then remember thine handmaid uh what's Abigail saying surely the prophecy of Samuel is going to come to pass in your life surely and when it does don't think back to this don't go down and shed blood ceaseless don't let this be a reproach against your name because at this point David had never killed Israelites he had only killed the enemy this would be the first time that he would kill of his own people amen and now Abigail's standing in the Gap not to protect nabel she's standing in the Gap to protect David to protect his kingdom to protect his name to protect his reputation and now listen he says verse 32 and David said to Abigail blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me and blessed be thy advice listen this is the money next in line to be king he's a mighty warrior and a mighty ruler and here this woman the wife of his enemy amen Abel uh who just rejected him she's imploring him don't stay in your reputation don't let this be a mark in your path you're going to come you're going to be uh your life is bound with the Lord you're going to come to your position don't do this and he says blessed be your advice Blessed Be Thy advice and blessed be thou which has kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand for in very deed as the Lord of God of Israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee except thou had hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left enabled by the Morning Light any that pisseth against the wall so David received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see I have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person the reason I wanted to go through this is because here's a humble little woman but she is wise in understanding here she is she's trapped in a bad situation she's married to a fool and he rejects David and but she knows David's coming into his kingdom and she goes and stands into the Gap and she tells David she starts instructing David she reminds him of the prophecy over his life she reminds him of what he's coming to and she tells him don't do this thing that will Mar that when you get to that day amen she what's she doing she's talking like Moses spoke to God and we know what happened she goes back into the neighborhood what she did and nabel dies his heart turns to Stone he dies and what does David do David said That's my kind of woman listen what did David want David wasn't looking for the yes sir yes sir yes sir wife that's not what David wanted David wanted this wife who would talk back to him who would contend with him that would tell him you know you've got better things in your life you're coming to a better position don't do this and David found her irresistible David is a type of Christ amen what is Christ one and a bride amen he's not want the one who believes that she's all the way down here he's all the way up here I can't even look his way he he he's wanting he's wanting a relationship that's much more significant than that he's looking for something that's why he tells his disciples I'm not going to call you service I'm going to call you friends he's looking for something that's much different than the old religious mentality of God so far away and me so far down here God Amen by Christ Has Lifted us up here so that we can talk to him so that we can contend with him so that we can remind him of his promise that we can remind him of what he said oh praise God when when when Moses starts telling God don't you know what the Egyptians will say about you listen like God didn't know and like God cared you know what the Egyptians say about him but it was the fact that Moses was contending with him and imploring him and what was Moses doing he was drawing Mercy out of God and what was Abigail doing to David she was drawing Mercy out of David so that more of David's attributes could be on display and Moses was drawing something out of God so more of God could be on display praise God we have to realize we're we're more than what we think we are and God wants more than what old religious Notions thought maybe God wants you to say God I don't understand what your Prophet meant by this would you please tell me not just if he wants me to know he'll tell me maybe it's laying there in an obscure way and all of a sudden it becomes the thing that you're desperate to know if you ever come across that something in the scripture something in the message and all of a sudden this is something I just want to know there's something in me burning to know this amen maybe that's God working on the other end amen and he's wanting to give you a revelation but you've got to draw the Revelation out of God and say God please I'm your bride would you reveal this word to me amen would you show me what this means praise be to God you know there's a there's a story in second Samuel 12 where David and Bathsheba they have this adulterous relationship and there's a child born and the child turns sick and when the child is sick David is fasting and laying on his face on the ground and fasting so that his servants are afraid to approach to him and I want to I want to pick this up and just read a portion verse 16 David therefore besought God for the child and David fasted in winning and lay all night upon the Earth and the odors of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the Earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died seven days he laid on his face and wouldn't eat and wept and cried out to God seven days but I want you to look at this came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the Servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken into our voice how will he then Vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead but when David saw that his servants whispered David perceived that the child was dead therefore David said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the Lord and worshiped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat now this is so strange because when the child is sick David's fasting and weeping before the Lord and interceding and laying on his face on the earth for seven days as soon as the child's dead now he's not weeping and fasting and crying now he gets up washed himself anoints himself change his apparel and sits down to dinner to eat and his servants are confused and it says verse 21 then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou's done thou didst and weep for the child and while it was alive but when the child was dead doubt is rise and eat bread and he said well the child was yet alive I fasted and wept for I said who can tell whether God will be gracious to me and the child may live what was David doing for seven days he was contending with God is that right he said Who would know if God would be gracious to me basically if God would answer my prayer God would be gracious to me and the child may live but now he is dead wherefore should I fast can I bring him back again I shall go to him but he shall not return to me David was contending with God and you know what in all of us contending he was contending with God I I'll put it this way this is just my understanding in the scriptures David would have never fasted late on the earth for seven days if he didn't believe there was a potential for him to implore God and for God to change his mind he laid there for seven days not for a show he laid there because he didn't know maybe God will be gracious with me and he had a relationship with God where David had spoke to God before amen when there was a plague going on over Israel amen he was interceding for the people and he said Lord let not them suffer for my sins when he numbered the people he implore God and the angel of the Lord stopped over Jerusalem and stopped with the sword drawn and David made sacrifice there and interceded amen David had he had contended with God before amen and now he's contending with the God again it doesn't mean that the will of God will not be finished amen the will of God will be performed but he knew when the child died that that was the period that was it that was the will of God and he got up and his contending was over his his fasting was over his weeping was over because God had given his final answer but until then he believed he could change the circumstances what a relationship he was in With God is what I would say I wonder if so many times we just leave things alone and we don't pray we don't earnestly pray because we don't know that he'll hear us or that we could change his mind I wonder if we don't see ourselves correctly maybe we view what God wants the wrong way maybe we're not understanding maybe we need to go back and read the Bible and find out how God interacted with his children and now his children interacted with him and maybe we'll learn something about what God is looking for God is looking for somebody to draw attributes out of him the Apostle Paul was trying a man to draw attributes of healing for his body and he said three times he sought the Lord why was why would he Pray Again I mean if you prayed once and nothing happened why would he Pray Again obviously he believed that he could change things that God would hear him but after the third time he sought the Lord the Lord told him I'm not going to heal you because this is for your good and then he says well praise God anyhow amen I'll now glory in my infirmities but what was it Paul amen was not just taking things the way they were he knew that there was a potential for healing he knew healing was part of the word and he was contending with God until God told him I'm not going to do it when he said I'm not going to do it he said praise God anyhow amen all glory in my infirmities and David was contending with God while there was yet a chance for the child to live but when God put the period at the end of the sentence he got up and he says why should I fast he I he cannot come to me but I will go to him David had tremendous faith in who he was praise God I wonder if God wants us to have an identity change and not keep seeing ourselves the way we've always seen ourselves in the past but if we could see ourselves the way he sees us you know when it came to job was contending with God job was saying I wish I knew where his house was I would knock on his door and I would go up and ask him some questions foreign is that what job was saying I want to know why I'm going through this I know that I've kept the word I know that I've offered the sacrifice I know that I'm righteous amen I don't know why God is doing this I look to the right he's not there to the left I can't perceive him I don't know what's happening in my life oh if I could just find his house if I could go to where he lives if I could knock on his door if we can have a conversation then I would know amen what did job want job wanted to contend with God and find out the answer amen and God came to job amen job got his answer amen and job found out God is everything I'm nothing but praise God look at job and job listen job is going through all of this if I can knock on his door if I could find out and I don't know why this is happening this is not right because I've offered the sacrifice this shouldn't be I shouldn't be getting punished and all of these things going back and forth and you would think God would be disgusted with job and just walk away but that's not the relationship he's in with job what's God going to do he's going to come down and answer job's question job didn't know where to find God he didn't know where the door was to knock on he didn't know how to get his answers but God came to job because God wanted to talk to job he oh my goodness God came to Abraham Abraham didn't come to God Amen even when he come to the plains of memory and told him about Sodom that wasn't something that Abraham discerned Abraham knew or Abraham asked for it was something that God came to him and God told him and when God told him amen maybe God was waiting for him to intercede amen it wasn't it wasn't that Moses found God in Mount Horeb it was that God found Moses it wasn't that Jacob found God God found Jacob amen it wasn't that you ever found God you never found God you never came to God God found you amen he drew you unless the father draws you you can't come amen and what do we see about all of his relationships David never found God and anoint himself the king God sent Samuel to David to anoint him to be king why because God wanted David in this relationship he wanted Abraham in this relationship he wanted a relationship with job he wanted a relationship with Noah he wanted a relationship with Moses he wanted a relationship with Israel he wants a relationship with you that's why he came to you you didn't come to him listen we we we act so much and uh I wish so bad that I could race all my religious training from the back and all my wrong understanding and get rid of it and understand Bible Way the Bible Way amen that God drew me I didn't come to him if he drew me he wants me [Music] we act so much like amen we're lucky to hear the message and from the human perspective we should never lose that gratitude I'm so grateful I feel like the luckiest human being but from God's perspective it wasn't luck we didn't stumble upon it we didn't search it out and find it it wasn't us finding him it was God finding us and God drawing him to ourselves not so we could act like we can't talk to God and we can't ask for anything and we're nobodies that's not he called you like he called Abraham like he called Jacob he called you the same way [Music] and he doesn't want you to act like a servant he didn't call you to be a servant he doesn't want you to act like a peon he didn't call you to be a peon he called you into a relationship unlike has been available to the New Testament Church for 2 000 years he called us for something different he called us to this message to this open book under this ministry for what reason he wants us in a different kind of relationship than the one who's afraid to ask for something than the one who feels like he can't approach God for the one who feels like it'd be wrong to ask God why listen it's not God wrong to ask God why you know brother Branham got in trouble because brother Branham said you owe me an explanation that was wrong but it wasn't wrong to say God I don't understand would you please help me when you start making demands God's not going to reach your demands but you can contend with God you can struggle with God God why I don't understand why like I I'm fine with whatever you want in my life I'll accept whatever you want amen but I don't understand why would you please show me why praise be to God we don't know we we don't always act like we understand the kind of relationship he's called us into and this I just want to go just a little bit further I don't want to cut this off for another day I want to finish just 15 more minutes maybe and the message God gifts always find their place he said if there isn't something in the name then why as long as Jacob was called Jacob which means to plan for deceiver that's what he was but when he wrestled with the Lord all night and the Lord changed his name when he was about 60 years old he changed his name from Jacob to Israel Prince before God and that's what he was why was Abraham had to be called Abram had to be called Abraham before the baby could be born why was Sarai called Sarah before the baby would be born why was Paul why was Saul his name was Saul but when he met Jesus he changed it from Saul to Paul when Simon was changed from Simon to Peter which means little Stone and all their names were changed it's because what you are called is something about it when you speak something it identifies itself this is why the angel said to Jacob what is your name who are you who Do You Think You Are [Laughter] who do you think you are that's why Brother Bear would start blasting Blasphemous names and saying I'm Methodist and I'm about this is what he's trying to break apart amen he's trying to break apart this whole thing and saying I'm Methodist I'm Baptist I'm Presbyterian I'm a brand of might I'm a message believer he's trying to break all of that apart till you know who you really are [Music] praise God so when you speak something and identifies itself let's go back to Genesis 33. and back to the life here of Jacob Genesis 33 Genesis 33 verse 18. and Jacob came to Salem a city of secum which is in the land of Canaan when he came from patanaram and pitched his tent before the city and he bought a parcel of field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamar seacom's Father for a hundred pieces of silver and he erected there an altar and called it elohe Israel El elohe Israel which means this is what this means the Mighty God of Israel immediately he begins to worship by his new identity he begins in worship to take the name that God gave him amen he begins to identify with what the angel said he was and he begins to recognize before when he was afraid of Esau he said God of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac I'm not worthy of the least of thy mercies amen please defend me from my brother for I'm afraid of Esau that'll kill me and now after he meets the angel the angel says you shall not any longer be called Jacob but Israel amen and he walks away from there a changed person and with a different identity and the next time we see him worship he builds an altar and when he builds an altar he's worshiping the Mighty God of Israel not the god of Abraham or the god of Isaac he's worshiping his God of his new identity and he's called him the Mighty God of Israel he's my God not when I was Jacob but who I really am he's the Mighty God of Israel what a way to worship friends he was worshiping with his true identity and the message once more brother bear says a name you say a name means nothing then when then why did God change Abram's name to Abraham and why did he change Saul's name to Paul and Simon name to Peter why did he change his own name why did he change Jacob to Israel not until he wrestled with the Lord not until he overcome and when Jesus over and when Jesus overcome death Hell In The Grave the Bible said he had a new name and when Jacob overcome and if the church can overcome she will stop saying I'm Methodist Baptist Presbyterian when she can overcome her Creeds in the world that she's then the world that she's drawed her in there she'll come back to the Bride of Jesus Christ misses Jesus Christ that's what what's that that's a different name it's not the name of a church it's not the name of a denomination it's not a name of a group belief amen it's a name of individuals that have United with Christ and if they'll ever quit calling ourselves this and calling ourselves that we'll come back to our true identity in Acts chapter 15 I'm going to read the scripture Acts chapter 15. that's chapter 15 and verse 14. so Simmons have declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name what is he going to the Gentiles for to take out of people for his name and to this agree the words of the Prophet as it is written after this will I return and will build again the Tabernacle of David which has fallen down and I will build again the ruins thereof and will set it up that the residue of the men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles are upon whom my name is called saith the Lord who doth all these things God is now turning to the Gentiles and he's looking for a people that are called by his name not their denominational names not their concept names not their Church name not their group name but that are called by his name and the first seal we know this so well but I I just want to rehearse it right here he says now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol he's talking about the breaking of the seals back in Revelation chapter 6 to the church it was a church symbol it was broke out so the church could see that under the seal was a white horse that was just a symbol form that wasn't the full Revelation or the interpretation it was symbol for him and he sang to the church it was a it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and then only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church notice now oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it why because in the Sixth Seal it was broke to a in a church form in a church symbol but now you're not going to be identified as the church anymore through the denominations but this is a different time you're coming out of the church ages into the bride age to an identification of a different relationship you are now going to move into the bright age and he says hey he wants the people to understand that it it wasn't broke amen it was just a symbol form to a church so if it's still in symbol form you're in church amen you're in church ages you're in church systems you're in church thinking amen but when the seal is actually broke when in the end time to who to the true church and he says now I I'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand who's it broke to it's broke to the bride so when the symbol of White Horse and when the sealed is broke under the opening of the seals it's broke to who not to Christ not to the church ages it's not broke to the Methodist and the Presbyterian and the Baptist and the Pentecostal it is broke to the bride so at the breaking of the seals there Comes A change in name because there Comes A change in dispensation there Comes A change in identity and now we have to worship with our new name not the old name with the old leaven of the church ages but under the new name under the new identification I'm not going to call you church I'm going to call you Pride now you're not Methodist now you're not Baptist now you are Mrs Jesus Christ [Music] brother Branham says in the Smyrna Church age when he's preaching it back in 1960 he says now a church now the church name is associated with the nature of its character oh I want you to catch this the church name is associated with the nature of its character he's referring to church ages did you notice the Smyrna meaning bitter and you notice each one of the church now it's the church name has something to do with the character of the church I would say something here but I better not because you'd get me wrong your name does too you might not know it but it does oh yes you say no it's numerology no it's not when Jacob was born they called him Jacob which was supplanter but when he wrestled with the angel God changed his name to Israel a prince is that right Saul was Saul of Tarsus a mean fellow but when he came to Jesus he was called Paul Simon's name was Simon but when he came to Jesus he was Peter a little Stone your name so say it's what you are it has an oppression upon your character hey that's so long please please don't ever refer yourself to yourself as a BCF in please that's going the wrong direction don't refer to yourself in any group terminology but the one that the prophet gave is the one that the Lord has given it's the designation for the season your title is bride your name is Mrs Jesus Christ and if you'll begin worshiping in that name and worship the Mighty God of Mrs Jesus Christ you're going to be worshiping under a new identification and it will actually change your characteristics he says no I want to read that lesson your name Associates what you are it has an oppression upon your character if you're just looking at the group name or the group Walker or we all believe the message that's a title that can mean something to so many different people amen but what we need is to go past that and go a little further and my name is not message believer my title is not message believer I believe the message with all of my heart amen but my title is bride and my name is Mrs Jesus Christ and in this carnal world you can call me Chad but I Know Who I Am by the grace of God because the seals was broke to the bride it has an impression upon your character it did upon Jacob it changes character and then he had the audacity to worship under his new name and he had the audacity to claim rights to a personal God that was his mighty God the Mighty God of Israel my God my mighty God the Mighty God of my new name the Mighty God of my new identity the Mighty God he he's not just my father's God he's my God and he can't just be the church is God he can't just be the prophets God he can't just be your parents God he's got to be your God he's got to be a personal God and he can't be the god of the Bride that's true he's the god of the Bride he's the god of the whole world he's the god over everything amen that's all true but you need him to be your God and you need to know your bride [Music] it will change it will have an impression upon your character now anybody can say anything I'm Brian I'm Brian I'm Brian I'm Brian my name is Mrs Jesus Christ that doesn't change anything but when it comes from a revelation of the heart when you know you've wrestled it out with the Lord and he has given you an identity chain and now you're willing to say what he said to you what he revealed to you that I am part of his bride I'm a member of his bride I'm part of his body I've taken his name his name is my name I'm under his name it'll change our worship it'll change our characteristics it'll change our actions it'll change the way we think [Music] brother Branham said in the Legacy in church age out of the church age book he says the name laodicea which means people's rights listen remember what he said about Smyrna he said a church name has to do with its characteristics I want to go back and read that one more time when he was in when he's preaching the Smyrna Church age he said the church name is associated with the nature of its character so now he says the name laodicea which means people's rights brother Branham also said it meant lukewarm and it also meant rich and increased because those are all the characteristics that are associated with the name laodicea rich and increased with Goods that have needed nothing amen lukewarm those are all characteristics associated with laodicea and the definition of the of the Greek word laodicea is people's rights the name literacy which means people's rights was very common and was given to several cities in honor of Royal ladies so named so it's a woman's name it's a Church's name and that Church's name laodicea has something to do with its characteristics and leaves an impression that is why we cannot be laodicean believers we cannot take that name we cannot come under that dispensation and under that name because that name brings characteristics to our life and the characteristics that that brings is it brings a state of thinking you're fine when you're not and it brings a state of thinking you have rights and you've achieved something and things belong to you when they don't and it'll bring you into a lukewarm condition where you think everything's fine I'm blessed I have no need everything's fine with me and you don't it brings a blindness where you do not realize your poor blind miserable wretched naked and I'm and you don't have anything going for you but you think everything's fine that's what laodicea that's the characteristics of laodicea that's why we cannot be laodicean believers we've got to move out of laodicea into the bride age and be part of the Bride we cannot stay in a laodicean condition under a laodicean title because it has an influence on our character brother man said in God's provide a place of worship he says now we've already resurrected the Dynamics and the mechanics is going to work quickening us and we're quickened up into the presence of God where his spirit is and now we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus sitting there that great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead were part of it if you're part of the Bride you are because the brightest part of the groom you know so we find out that it's the same thing and she'll do just exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day she won't be a laodicea not by no means a lukewarm but she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirit of God why because she doesn't think she's already arrived she's recognizing I'm pressing on I'm becoming all that he wants me to be as his bride brother Brown says in the message Feast of trumpets he said now if I come with the message of Pentecost I would be in the laodicean church age and it would it wouldn't be right that's what he said if I came with the pen the message of Pentecost so he can't come with the message of Pentecost he has to come with the bride's message if I come with the message of Pentecost I would be in the laodicean church age and it wouldn't be right that would be wrong so to be in the laodicean church age would be wrong to bring the message to Pentecost would be wrong what would be right is to say come out from among her my people be separate don't be identified there be identified here in the bride age be identified in the body of Christ come to Union with the word and take a new name you yourself personally become Mrs Jesus Christ don't let it be a blanket title that covers everybody no let it be your title brother remember said in God's chosen place of worship so there's many fine women in the building tonight find loyal women but there's one Mrs William Branham she's the one goes home with me she's the one that's my wife there's fine people in the world fine churches but there's one Mrs Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming for that's where his name Lays where's his name is in his bride what's his name upon upon his bride she's not taken her own identity she's not taken another name other characteristics now listen you say well we don't take names we don't call ourselves this we don't call ourselves that I I don't just mean what you call yourself this is how you perceive yourself because if you perceive yourself in your old nature the perception has to change to your new name there's one Mrs Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming forth that's where his name lays there is where his worship is in her and her alone when when when Jacob now Israel Builds an altar amen he is Israel he is the prince with God he is the one who struggles with and overcomes he's the one who can get a hold of God and hang on till he gets what he needs he's in a special identity a special class of person and he builds an altar and he calls it the Mighty God of Israel my God I'm worshiping my God personal God not a group God I'm worshiping the Mighty God of Israel right here and the question is what God do we worship amen I mean God is God God's a a generic term amen it means god and Elohim and all these other terms we can worship that with a mentality amen that we're worshiping a a general God out there amen but Israel after he wrestled with the the Lord he was worshiping a personal God the Mighty God that was his God [Music] Jesus after he resurrects he tells the disciple he tells uh Mary Magdalene he says go tell my disciples that I go to my father and to their father he's trying to get them to catch something on a personal level and he says I'm going to my God and to your God Hey listen don't let him be amen just the bride the the god of the Bride or the bridegroom of the Bride let him be your bridegroom amen your personal bridegroom the one that you have personally come into a union with that you can contend with him that you can ask him that you can talk to him the way Abigail talked to David and stole David's heart what did David want oh he wanted Abigail what did Abigail have she had something that the other girls didn't have she was able to talk to him on a completely different level God has never been able to have this kind of conversation in the church ages amen the seals weren't open his mystery wasn't laid bare he hadn't unveiled himself amen he had people with partial understanding amen praying out was a partial understanding partial understanding partial understanding but now he's got a people that he has unveiled himself to so that they can say oh God didn't your Prophet say doesn't your words say didn't you show us your characteristics God I know your plan Lord keep your plan in my life he wants a woman that can talk to him contend with him on a totally different level that's drawing the characteristics out of God oh friends we've got to climb higher we gotta shed all this wrong thinking we got to stop thinking like we've been thinking and start thinking like the word tells us the thing we've got to think on Bible terms we've got to think on what the prophet brought us and stop this carnal I'm no good and I'm I listen that's as true as true can being will always be true your fleshes go good you know what was it Paul said I know that it's in me that is in my flesh there is no good thing so let's just get that out of the way amen how many people here in your flesh has no good thing no qualities no abilities nothing that makes you an inexpenser all right then lay that to the side and let's quit talking about the kernel and start talking about the real reality of your life the reality of your life is there's nobody else on earth like you there's not another one there's a specific attribute that God had attached to you a thought a manifestation he wanted in your life and it cannot be copied it cannot be mimicked it cannot be imitated it's you there's nobody else but you the bridegroom's coming for you and nobody else bite you [Music] worship the bridegroom of you this is not group thinking this is not denominational thinking he has ripped open a whole new level friends a whole new relationship a whole new uh ability a whole new uh a potential and he wants a woman that'll run to him and say oh God don't let my co-workers see the sickness going in my life I've told him your word is true I told him that by your stripe is healed don't let them mock you don't let them disbelieve your word heal me so that they'll know that you're the great God that I said you are he needs a woman to talk to him with revelation and understanding Abigail was a woman of understanding praise God is called us to an identity change this message did not tell us to stay low to see him stay in a little sin condition stay under a Pentecostal message it called us into a bright age into a new name and a new identity and now whatever's on your driver's license is inconsequential whatever you used to think about yourself it doesn't matter once Jacob come in contact with a living God what he was before didn't matter anymore what he was afraid of before didn't matter anymore what others thought of him didn't matter anymore he knew who he was and he knew who was God was and now if we could come the same way and to listen this is the Living God this is the reality that we can get a hold of amen and grab a hold of it and say God I'm not going to let you go until you give me an identity change till you bless me and change my name I don't want to go on in the same carnal thinking with the same carnal desires and the same natural this and that I got to have a change in my life will you bless me by giving me a change in identification I can stand over you and say your bride I can say you're Mrs Jesus Christ but if your mind doesn't change your heart doesn't grab it it doesn't mean a thing you can say yay man that's nothing but the truth because you're thinking in general terms amen but the angel came to Jacob when he was alone and gave him his personal identification so that it could not be shared with anybody else there was nobody there to share it with and we've got to come in contact when God passes you away how's he passing your way he's passing your way tonight friends just open your eyes and see that this is the living breathing Jesus Christ he's being manifest in his word he is the word he's the word that's been unveiled in this day and he's passing by get a hold of him and ask him to change your name not just in your mouth but in your heart change who you are oh this is not a game this is not a church this is not a social gathering this is the reality this is the reality of eternities this has been in the back part of God's mind for thousands and thousands of years before there was time this was God's plan and he wants you to enter that relationship [Music] praise be to God I say it's time we contend with the Lord and say God I've got to have a chain I can't have these desires ruling over me another day I can't have this lust I can't have this grief I can't have any of this God you've got to give me a change in my identification so that I can take the name that changes and influences my characteristics I've got to know that I'm Mrs Jesus Christ that I'm part of that bride that I am included and that you're my bridegroom and that when brother Venom says I no longer call you church because I ah I'm going to call you bride so you understand there's something in you to say he's talking to me he's talking to me you know what if you believe he's talking to you too I'm happy for that but I believe one thing for sure he's talking to me can we receive him that way can we receive him as talking to me listen there's several people in the building tonight and everybody's heard what I've said amen but I'm asking you the question who was he talking to was he talking to you personally was he calling your name personally was he drawing you out of a carnal condition into a reality of who you really are because who you really are is not the man you see in the mirror the woman you see in the mirror who you really are is who you see in the mirror of God's word when the veil's been taken away and the obscurity has been polished away and now you can know even as you're known you can see because that which is perfect has come because what we do have by God's grace is the perfect interpretation of the word my Divine Vindication so that we're not looking into a glass Darkly but we're looking into a clear glass and what we see is face looking back to face what he is I am [Applause] that's what he's called me to be that's what this message came to give us an identification to look in the mirror not a natural mirror this mirror and find out who we are I am not Jacob I'm Israel I I'm not just worshiping the god of William Branham although it's the same God but it's gone deeper inside of me and now I'm worshiping The God Who is called Chad Lamb who's called me out of carnal and called me into himself that's the god that I'm worshiping is that the god you're worshiping are you worshiping your God are you worshiping your bridegroom that's the one that's the one that'll change everything let's all stand musicians if you could come let's just bow our heads pray Lord Jesus God I have delivered my soul lord and I pray that these words would find their place Lord God that it wouldn't be just a sermon preached in a two-hour spin in a church service Lord but God made the words that you've placed on my heart that you brought out under the anointing of your spirit may they find their home Lord in the hearts and The Souls of your children to bring a true identification God break the carnal break the old break all those things away break out of the flesh Lord and bring the reality to people's lives God help us Lord to not live an old identification but help us to keep Lord as you keep wooing us and you keep telling us who we are and you keep Whispering Your Love secrets in our ear and you keep calling a sweetheart you keep calling us bride you keep calling us by your name may we keep acting like it Lord and responding to what you're calling to the names you're calling Lord may we respond to it may our character be influenced by what you're calling us and may we act like your bride and walk like your bride and talk like your bride God may we take your name may your name be upon us Lord so that it's not us the people see but it's you your name lays in your bride because she's living out your life God make it personal I pray make it a living reality first by the foolishness of preaching you've chose to save Souls we believe it Lord we've done it at your bidding and we believe that it'll have an effect Lord I pray you break Satan's strongholds of the Mind carnality and past life I pray to break those holes off of your children May the life that's in the seed be quickened by the spirit of God May that word take root and may it bring a new life Lord the one that you've ordained to be manifest in this day may it bring forth in Israel a contender with God a prince with God a wrestler with God somebody that will enter into a relationship Lord that will that will talk to you that will plead with you that will agonize with you to keep your word God help us to be that kind of Bride we love you God we ask you blessings over us help us Lord as we walk out of these doors May these things not fade out of our lives but Lord take us into a higher plane into a higher walk into a greater manifestation pray you bless your people in Jesus Christ's name amen and like no
