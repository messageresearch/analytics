[Music] praise the lord that's very fitting let's just bow our heads together precious lord jesus we just want to pause here and approach you by way of prayer once more father as we would come to this juncture of the service lord where we step from what mortals can do to what no mortal can do lord for we have to have you now lord we can come and we can sing your praises we could get in our cars by your grace and drive here physically lord but now we come to a point to where there's nothing we can do lord and if you don't come we would have gathered in vain so we would just ask now is that we would yield ourselves to you both hearer and speaker that you would come and have the preeminent sword and that you would do what only you can do we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ and the bride says amen god bless you so good to be with you this evening if you have your bibles we'll go to the book of revelation chapter 21. revelation chapter 21. and i want to look at a topic tonight by way of a title of the tabernacle of god is with men i'm just a little loud up here if you can turn that down just a little bit thank you so much the tabernacle of god is with men we'll begin reading chapter 21 and verse 1. and he says i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there were no more sea was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done now let's turn all the way back to the beginning of the bible genesis 1. genesis 1 and verse 31. genesis 1 31 and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made god bless you as you would have your seats and i've purposely read from revelation and genesis that way i would terrify you into thinking i was going to preach the entire bible tonight and you'll be grateful when i just go a couple hours not really i'm going to do my best to behave but i want to look at this the tabernacle of god is with men and if we look at the word tabernacle a tabernacle is an establishment of god and a tabernacle is not just a foundation a tabernacle has walls tabernacle has a roof and the tabernacle has stuff inside of it so a foundation is good a foundation is excellent we have to have a foundation we have to have a foundation in so much that i think the lord ordained that i couldn't preach this the wednesday a couple back that i was supposed to until our pastor came and preached the message on a solid foundation maybe i'm just fanatical it's possible but we just watch those things but we he came and he preached that message of this of the sheer foundation and now i want to look at what we need to put on a sure foundation what is god trying to do because we know god's purpose and intent is not just to lay a foundation and leave it there but his purpose and his intent is to build something so a tabernacle has walls a tabernacle has a roof and the tabernacle has things inside of it and a tabernacle on the spiritual side is reflecting an establishment of god this is something that the children of israel did when they were coming through the wilderness you remember they were just wandering in the wilderness but there came a point in time that they built a tabernacle so there was a stepping point there was a juncture in time there was a purpose behind that and it was representing that god was trying to establish them around something so the tabernacle was in the middle and then the children of israel were surrounding that and i'm not going to go into all of those those details there but you understand that main principle but this record this represents an establishment of god this represents the stableness of god this represents the confidence of god um a tabernacle is a unmoving structure with walls and a roof now it can be moved at the direction of god so it's not a temple once the temple's there it's not going anywhere you understand but that's not what the voice told john the the voice did not tell john that the temple of god is with men it said the tabernacle of god is with men so it is a movable structure but it's not easily moved it has to be orchestrated by god they're following the pillar of uh fire they're following the cloud so when god would move and and things of that nature then it can be disassembled and it can be moved along but not easily it's it's an establishment it's something that's stable let's turn to ephesians 4. ephesians 4. ephesians 4 and 11 very familiar and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of the saints so this is not just for a foundation of the saints this is for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god and to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so not just a partial portion of christ but the fullness of christ an established christ that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro you're not just going to grab the tabernacle and throw it around it's an establishment it can be disassembled to take it apart but not easily it's not just easily tossed around you're not going to throw it in a duffel bag and take off with it you're not going to be any more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lay and wait to deceive so we're obviously spiritualizing this tabernacle and that's what this voice in the book of revelation is doing it's we know that god does not have a physical tabernacle that he's going to cram into your flesh he's not going to take sticks and stones and brick and mortar and cram it into your flesh but he's saying the tabernacle of god is with men so it's a spiritual application very much so but this is true because we can literally become the tabernacle of god to the point that brother branham said that a man can get so full of christ and so full of god that satan does not know what to do with him that's more than a foundation when you get to the point that satan does not know what to do with you that's not just a foundation you're coming into the perfection of christ let's turn back to revelation chapter one i want you to look at this actually written in the bible revelation chapter 21 and if we look at if we look at verse one it says i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there were no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so that's verse one and verse two but then when you get to verse 3 is the declaration and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men so it is immediately after john sees the new heaven and the new earth and the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven then the declaration goes forth that the tabernacle of god is with men you say well what does that mean because if you will recollect when brother branham comes and he preaches future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride he goes through all of these scriptures this is the scripture that he uses for that message but he goes through all of those scriptures and he takes hours and then he gets to the end of it and he says i could drop a little something here if you would like so he goes for hours and hours and then he comes right at the very end and says oh i could tell you something here if you would like and he takes the dimensions of that pyramid of that of that city and he places it on the people and he makes the city now he has the authority to do this i don't have the authority to do this there's nobody in this building that has that authority but he takes this scripture and he takes that city and he literally makes it the people that set him before him so he then declares coincidence coincidentally enough just what the scripture declares because the scripture comes and says i see a new heaven i see a new earth i see the holy city the new jerusalem coming down oh by the way the tabernacle of god is with men you say well i'm sure that was just a coincidence how that worked out he probably just thought of that at the end of the service saints he was literally walking through the scriptures literally fleshing out the scriptures he could not have done anything different because this is exactly what he already did remember this was the angel that showed it to john the first time he can't do anything different so he has to go through verse 1 verse 2 to get to the end of his sermon and finally say oh i could drop a little something here if you would like because this is what he has already done i would almost venture to say that he was riding the trail again this was not the first time that he has done this so he's literally doing this exactly as the scriptures laid in our bible but that declaration comes in the scriptures and in 1964 i believe is when he preached is that correct i think it was at the end of 1964. it it comes and it's fleshed out literally in this same pattern that it's written in the scriptures and that it was preached at the branham tabernacle it's very important that we catch that it's not a coincidence so he goes through verse one goes through verse two drops a little something there in verse three but let's continue and read four five and six he says a great voice out of heaven said behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done you can't get to it being done until you go through verse one through five we're not going to get to the end unless we go through verse one through five but this this voice that's spoken it says behold the tabernacle of god is with men gives a definition for that it says behold the tabernacle of god is with men and then it lays out the definition he will dwell with them they will be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their us there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away so by the time you get to this portion of scripture you're already saying well that can't already be because i still have that but do you but do you because we can cry we can weep we can get upset but do we not have a prevailing word it's not that all the symptoms just magically disappear the symptoms may still be there but the symptoms are subject to something so whatever is greater takes the precedence and the declaration can be made furthermore how would he wipe the tears from your eyes if you didn't have tears coming from your eyes but the tears coming from your eyes is not the reality it's not the permanent reality him wiping the tears from your eyes is the permanent reality so it's not just all in the future this is very much a present tense living word that has the power christ himself that has the power to do this he shall wipe all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death brother branham says you've already passed from death unto life may there be people in this room that go by way of the grave maybe but you have already passed there is no more death to you a child of god does not die there is no more death remember this is not my declaration this is the angel's declaration i would almost venture to say that he declared that when he preached it's the rising of the son this declaration has been made this is a reality if you want to walk in it if you don't want to walk in it it won't be a reality but there is a presence and there is a word and there is a god a living god among us in the form of his word that can make this a reality neither crying nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away your new birth and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done so now as we're coming through this scripture and brother bradham takes verse one and two and he preaches that message the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and he breaks that down and he shows what god is going to do and then he takes that and he places it on the people and he makes them the city and he makes and he identifies their god to them and he makes them aware that god is dwelling with him and that god is there to wipe away their tears not not just a good thought saints not just a good thought in your imagination not your willpower literally the word the person of the word has come to do these things and he's making the people aware of them and there's a declaration that goes forth that says when when the people and the word comes to this point god himself is making a declaration when it comes to this juncture in time and when it comes to this point the tabernacle of god is with men now this is a declaration by god himself you can argue with it if you want to but it doesn't change anything because god himself says when it comes to this juncture in time and to this point and when these words are uttered and when these scriptures are fulfilled i myself am making a declaration that the tabernacle of god is now with men so much so that when he comes to verse six he would say it is done it is done the tabernacle of god is with men a couple more verses it is done there is only three times that i can find that this is mentioned in the scriptures that god makes this declaration the first is we've already read in genesis in genesis 1. he created the host let's just go back up and read it so i don't butcher it and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day thus the heaven and the earth were finished and all the host of them they were finished and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from his work which he had made so god comes out and he declares it is very good it's finished it's done now this does not mean that god stopped revealing himself because he even moved and put man in flesh so he continued revealing himself but what was done was the tabernacle of god was with men what was done was what god was wanting to accomplish in a relationship because the relationship was what he was after and he creates all of these things and all of these things man and woman even though they have not been separated yet and put in two distinct bodies of flesh even though he hasn't continued in his revelation he has come to a point in his revelation that he himself would step back and say this is very good and i'm done but yet he would continue revealing himself and he would continue revealing himself but the point and the purpose the relationship and the preeminence that he was after he had successfully obtained so that's in genesis then we come into the new testament and christ himself comes on earth and he has his ministry and he goes to the cross and they nail him to the cross and the last words that are uttered out of his mouth is it is finished so he says this in the very beginning when his relationship is correct and then he comes and he obtains preeminence in his son in the man christ jesus so much so that he would lay down his own life and be nailed to a cross and he would utter the words it is finished well we know it wasn't finished because we had to come out of him there was further revelation there was farther there was farther expressions that came forth but what god was after in the form of a relationship he comes and makes that declaration it is done it is finished this is it and then he keeps revealing himself and then he comes to the end of the book that we've just been reading here in revelation chapter 21 and he would show the new heavens and the new earth the new jerusalem the holy city and he would show all of that and he declares himself as our god our comforter to take away the sting of death to take away all sorrow and he would have a vindicated prophet standing on the earth that would say by the way you're the city and when that declaration goes forth god himself comes behind that and says it is done what i'm wanting to achieve my purpose here it is done it is finished i am satisfied i am happy it is very good but yet brother branham said he would be revealing himself to us throughout eternity but the relationship that he is after remember he had he had a threefold plan in the back of his mind the whole time he had that in eden that's why he could declare it's done but then it fell so he has to start restoring it and he re he obtains preeminence in christ jesus so he can declare it's done it's finished for the revelation comes out for the revelation further expression now he has his bride again and he declares it is done it is finished it is good i am resting but then remember he's going to take them back to eden but the relationship is what he's after that is what he is uttering the declaration about of it being finished of it being done john 19. i just covered this but i want to read it real quick john 19 28. after this jesus knowing that all things were accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled that's the important part that this scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst now there was said a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished remember these are the final words of christ and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost these are the final words of god in flesh these are not trivial words these are not a spontaneous utterance he meant what he said so how can he declare that it is finished but yet there are farther expressions and for the revelation to come forth because what was finished was what was god trying to obtain what was his purpose what was he trying to do remember his threefold plan so now christ god in flesh is coming and he's recognizing that he has obtained preeminence in a man moses couldn't do it abraham couldn't do it jacob couldn't do it isaac couldn't do it joseph couldn't do it they're all building up to that but finally he gets preeminence in one man and that part of the plan he puts his stamp on it and he says it's finished it's done hebrews 12 verse 1 says wherefore seeing we are also encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every way and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the saint the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god so jesus makes this declaration that it is finished but remember he's the author and finisher of the faith he's the author and finisher of our faith the author and finisher of our faith but christ knows he has come to this preeminence he has came to this juncture in time he has fulfilled what the scripture has said about him he has fulfilled what god has wanted from him and he knows that if he has done that he has made a way to finish the faith that is why he can declare it as finished he finished his portion yes but that was enabling us to then finish our portion he knows where he's standing he knows what he has accomplished he knows what he has done and he is making that declaration not lightly he is making an emphatic declaration it is finished it is done remember we're speaking about the tabernacle of god being with men jesus came to the point that he could lay his own life down so that the scriptures would be fulfilled to know where he stand to the point that he can declare god's plan in me is finished brother branham says the bride would be the final voice to the final age this was not a flippant voice that jesus used when he declared this the final voice to a final age will not be a flip of voice if i'm going to make it today i might not make it tomorrow i'm okay with christ now not okay with christ now i'm a son of god today i'm not a son of god tomorrow that's not a tabernacle that's a child blown with doctrine back and forth that's a child blown back and forth with their emotional state that's not a tabernacle that's established it's not even a firm foundation to put walls in a roof on if we're to be a final voice to a final age we have to be an established tabernacle that's the that's the declaration from christ the tabernacle of god is with men if the final voice is in the bride which i believe it is we believe that it is it's not going to be an unsteady voice it's not going to be a pup tent that you can take take down and set up in 30 seconds it's going to be the tabernacle of god in men an establishment with walls and a roof and things inside of it not easily moved it can be moved if god directs it to be but not easily moved and only moved when god moves so we can say that and i think we believe that that we're the final voice to the final age but the final voice to the final age is going to be a sure voice it is not going going to declare things flippantly it is going to be very steady it is going to be very established psalm 27 verse 1 says the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though and host shall encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war shall rise against me in this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock this is the scripture that brother brandon preached the rapture message out of and look what david's talking about a temple a tabernacle a pavilion established establishments not easily moved things that are put in place and in a certain spot for a reason very stable verse six and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies around about me therefore i will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord so verse one through six david is nailing it down i am god's son he is with me i am in his pavilion i am in his temple i am in his tabernacle my enemies are around me and i don't care god will deal with them and then it comes to verse 7. hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me you say well that's a paradox that is a paradox but your answer is in a couple verses right above that because he says in verse 6 now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies his head will be lifted up above his enemies not his whole body his head will be lifted up his revelation will be lifted up and established and secure but that does not mean you're not going to have a bad death you're allowed to have a bad day but go back to what's in your head your revelation and overcome the bad day there's nothing wrong with crying out to god to have mercy on me been there done that usually three or four times a day there's nothing wrong with crying out to the lord hear my voice have mercy on me what have i done now why am i like this what's going on what did i do there's nothing you haven't lost your mind david did the same thing immediately after six verses of telling everybody he didn't care where his enemies were at and what they were doing god dealt with them i'm invincible can't touch me i'm lifted up i'm in god's pavilion his head was his revelation was but there was still hybridization attacking it but that doesn't matter because the word can and will prevail if if and only if you get back in the tabernacle back in the pavilion back in the temple you get outside of the pavilion outside of the tabernacle outside of the temple all you're going to do is whine and cry for god to have mercy on you and you should and you should because you're going to need it but he has sent a word an all-encompassing word i would say it this way he has brought a word he didn't just send it he has brought a word to cover that to be a pavilion around you to rapture you up to rapture your revelation to catch you up into his temple to catch you up into his pavilion that even those those things would be real in this dimension they're not real in reality i'm not going to try to explain that statement i hope you got it brother branham speaks about abraham and he says abraham represented election isaac represented justification jacob represented grace joseph represented perfection and he says that is what god built when he said he built on those patriarch those patriarchs but you look at abraham he was elected would anybody deny that abraham was not elected but abraham was so elected that he was terrified to go down into this city with his wife because the king would kill him and take his wife who the promised son was supposed to come through he was so elected that he would tell her to lie like whatever you got to do lie you're not my wife don't let them kill me abraham was full of election undisputed but he was still still fearful isaac the promised son brother says represented justification but he was so justified he would do the same thing as daddy did and go and lie because he was still fearful jacob represented grace but jacob was terrified of his own brother terrified what couldn't even go back home until he had a wrestling match with god himself election justification and grace undeniable but still feel free still fearful but brother randall says joseph was perfection i want to read you this quote about joseph it's one of my favorite quotes it's mind-blowing to me i've read it here before but he says this concerning joseph's daily walk he says now joseph saw it by his own life he's speaking of the resurrection he's speaking of the resurrection of christ he says now joseph saw it in his own life he seemed that he was born a peculiar boy that he was a seer there was something about him he could see visions he couldn't understand it he even went and told his mother and father when they tried to correct him when he seen the sheaves all bowing to his he couldn't understand it but then next thing he found out that he was betrayed by his brethren so joseph has this vision of everything bowing down to him but then he's betrayed thrown in a ditch taken up as dead taken down to egypt and thrown in prison his response his response he said what am i portraying here what is this for knowledge that i am receiving that's a pretty typical response i mean it's probably what i would do totally different than abraham isaac and jacob totally different no fear no fear the only fear that he had was that one scratch on the masterpiece that he told his father to lie because he still had a little bit of pride of life in him but he had to because he wasn't christ jesus so he had to have that little scratch brother and he said but this is a man whose daily walk was so sure and so established that when he would see something that he knew was 100 true and then everything else listen everything else would deny that everything that he saw everything that he heard even everything he tasted was denying that revelation and he would still have one question for god not why not poor me what are you trying to reveal through my life right now oh my goodness what a maturity what a state of mind you tell me what the devil does with that he only has one option when you come to that level he has only got one option and he has got to kill the vessel that's carrying that but he can't do that he cannot do that because god says you will not have permission to do that but remember his works to discredit the word and if he can't do that kill the vessel when you come to this level of maturity he has no options but to either run and get away from you or kill you and he can't kill you because you're predestinated for your atoms to change and go into in a physical rapture that's not just a good saying saints that's what the prophet taught a man can get so full of god that satan doesn't know what to do with him remember he's only got the two tactics to discredit the word and make you unbelieve or to kill you so if he can't make you unbelieve and you are so mature to the point that every attack that he brings in your life your response is thank you jesus i love you what part of your word am i portraying right now i'm pretty sure he's recognizing yeah i probably better get them off the scene i think they're believing the word because you may fake that once maybe even twice but you're not going to do it monday tuesday and wednesday by wednesday you'll fall apart if it's a fake but if it's real it'll be a daily life each and every day walking with the word walking with the spirit walking in christ setting in his pavilion setting in his temple allowing god's declaration to be true my tabernacle is with that man my tabernacle is with that woman they have recognized they are my city and i am declaring and oh by the way john write it down because it's true and it's faithful what an example joseph would set i would say i would say to try that start trying that but it's going to have to be more than a try sense it's going to have to be reality but i would say this the same way brother branham said about your physical health you set a well person out in front of you and you walk into it i say go home and put it on your fridge go home and write some post-it notes what part of christ am i portraying in this situation let it become a reality walk into it because it's real it is possible and now i'm going to tell you why it's possible revelation 2 verse 13. revelation 2 verse 13. revelation 2 13 i know thy works this is christ himself speaking and where thou dwellest where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is could we all agree that we're sitting in satan's seat we're walking around in satan's seat so much so that the the prophet would say this is satan's eden it's not just his seat it's his eden and thou hold as fast my name and has not denied my faith that's how you can get to the point that your reaction to every situation can be what part of your word and your attributes am i portraying right now because if it was your faith you'd never be able to do it but christ has said i know thy works and where thou dwellest he knows where you're at saints he hasn't forgot you he knows where we're at he knows we're in satan's eden but he says i know your works where thou dwellest even where satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name remember his name is his characteristics you can run around screaming jesus all you want if you don't have the characteristics of jesus be quiet but if you have the characteristics of jesus you don't even have to say the name jesus satan recognizes the characteristics just like they did with peter and john when they took him before the council we don't know what's going on here we don't know where you come from but i know where their characteristics came from and i know who you've been with thou has not denied my faith big difference from his faith in your faith church age book brother branham says acts 3 16 when peter was asked how the mighty miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful we explained it in this verse or in this was and in his jesus name through faith in his jesus name hath made this man the former strong yea the faith which is by brother brandon puts in parentheses from him parentheses jesus hath given him the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is jesus name and jesus faith brought about the miracle peter did not claim it was his own human faith any more than he claimed that it was his own name he said that jesus name used in the faith which is from jesus performed the great works this is how it's possible saints this is how joseph could have the reaction that he had this face this faith is what the lord was speaking about in revelation 2 13. it was his faith it was not faith in him this is deep saints catch it it was not faith in him but it was his own faith christ's own faith god's own faith that he had given to the believers this is not intellectualism this is literally a portion of god his faith the same faith that he had when he said let there be and believed his own word and it performed is what he has given to the believers his own faith that he has given to the believers romans 12 3 according as god hath dwelt dealt to every man according to verse 1 the men are brethren the measure of faith ephesians 2 verse 8 by grace are ye saved through faith and that faith not of yourself it is a gift of god not just a gift from god it is a gift of god it is a gift of god if i want to give one of you a gift i can bring and i can give you a gift and i can walk away but this gift is a gift of god so if god brings a gift of himself and he gives it to you he can't walk away he's there it's of him you say that's really simple i know it is but praise the lord it excites me it's not a gift from him it's a gift of him this is what you can overcome by because gifts will fail even true gifts true gifts will fail but the gift of him the gift of god will not fail john 13 verse 1 says now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world and to the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judah security simon's son to betray him jesus knowing jesus knowing that the father had given all things unto his hands and that he was come from god and went to god that's a revelation jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god that he went to god i would venture to say this is the faith of god this is the revelation of god jesus knowing this rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded that's not a man's reaction that is not a carnal reaction this is a true and accurate reaction to a proper revelation brother branham says true revelation always always always brings humility that's what you can judge revelation about that's what you can judge whether it's a gift from god or a gift of god jesus knowing all things were in his hands and that i'm come from god and that i'm going back to god come here and let me wash your feet that is not a hybrid reaction that is not giving over to the lust of the eye to the pride of life and the lust of the flesh that is a complete and utter death to self and a proper revelation with a proper reaction i want to look at this real quick he told me i could do this myself he beat me to it i want to now look at a big picture i want to look at a big picture of the message and of brother branham's ministry with a understanding that brother branham said when that angel goes forth and begins to declare his message he says now not the healing campaigns he says but when he begins to declare his message when he begins to speak the word when this angel begins to do that this is the message not the minor gifts as great as they were not the discernment as great as it was but he says when he goes out and begins to declare the message that's what this angel is really sent for when this third poll starts getting into getting into action now i would venture to say the majority of a setting here have the understanding that this angel that was revealing these things to john was brother branham but just in case you don't or just beca in case you're on the fence i want you to compare this with your bible brother branham comes at the end of 1960 and he begins walking through the book of revelation literally he comes and he preaches the revelation of jesus christ at the in december 1960. he comes and he breaches the patmos vision and guess what he goes right into the church ages you say oh well he's just taking it and breaking it down like any good teacher will do i mean that's just that's just good common sense it is but this is different because any good teacher any good teacher wouldn't go from the philadelphian church age into the 10 virgins 144 000 jews and then come back and do the laodicean church age i guarantee you there is no school grade school high school junior high college that would do that they're going to go from the philadelphia and church age to the laodicean church age but he can't do that because remember he's already ran this trail once and it's in the scriptures that he can't do that whether he knows it or not i don't know i wasn't there to ask him i would venture to say he had at least some kind of inkling but whether he did or whether he didn't i don't know the fact of the matter is he did it scripturally in order with the scriptures so he comes 1960 at the end of 1960 and he goes revelation jesus christ patna's patentless vision church ages 10 virgins 144 000 jews and then he goes and finishes the laodicean church age and then he goes immediately into revelation chapter four and if you go home and you follow this through your bible you'll realize this is what you're doing on his message titles literally this is what you're doing it goes from revelation chapter four goes to chapter five does a few parts on each one of those comes to 1963 now this is not an exhaustive list for those of you that are very analytical because i know there's some of you here this is not an exhaustive list if you want i can do that but it's wednesday night so i'm having mercy he comes and he hits the breach first seal second seal third seal fourth seal fifth seal and we know this this is common to us but he comes in between the sixth and the seventh seal does questions and answers and then he comes a couple months later does christ is the mystery of god revealed goes to the feast of the trumpets and again if you're following in your bible this is what you're doing you can literally see his footprints walking right through walking right through but this is where it got interesting for me because he comes after the seals and he hits towards the tail end of 1964 and he preaches future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride now remember the scriptures that he used for this was in revelation chapter 21. there's only one more chapter left but he still has over a year of ministry left but there's only one chapter left but he only has a he has he still has a year of ministry left and he's still preaching but there's only one more chapter left and there has been a declaration by god himself that when you come to this point you're done because the tabernacle of god is with men and it's finished but he preaches future home and then he says the identified masterpiece of god well what's the identified masterpiece of god the earthly bride then he comes and he preaches birth pains well who's going to have the birth pains the earthly bride and then he preaches god's provided place of worship well where's that it's in the bride it says what's the attraction on the mountain and in that message he says what we looked at for years and what we pondered at and studied at he says everything that we've been looking at now that is history remember there's only one chapter left 1965 911 god's power to transform to transform what an earthly bride what house will you build me i don't know maybe an earthly bride if that'll do i mean that's what god said he wanted so i guess that'll do the invisible union of the bride of christ to what maybe a heavenly bridegroom and then he hits the rapture because remember there's one chapter left even so come quickly lord jesus but he has one more title right at the very end of his ministry things that are to be and the reason that he has to preach things that are to be is because he don't have a choice because revelation chapter 1 verse 19 says write the things which thou hast seen what he saw on the isle of patmos the seven-fold person is of jesus christ write all those things that you've seen john and the things which are christ through the church ages and by the way write the things that will be hereafter so when he comes and preaches future home whether he knew it or not i don't know but god himself had already made the declaration it's done your ministry is finished my tabernacle is now with men your purpose is accomplished he has nothing else to preach but he keeps preaching because remember when god says it's done and it's finished and i approve he still keeps revealing himself but what he's after is that relationship so when he comes and he takes that new heavens that new earth that holy city the new jerusalem and he takes that and says that is you people the tabernacle of god is with men he only has one chapter left to work with and one verse in chapter 1 verse 19. anything else would be unscriptural so the only thing he can preach about is either the heavenly bridegroom or the earthly bride or the relationship and that's what he does all the way down through here until he finally says okay i can finally touch revelation chapter 22 even so come quickly lord jesus physical rapture and then just because he probably liked to preach the gospel he says surely there's just a little bit something else i can talk about surely i've got some standing somewhere and he comes to revelation chapter 1 verse 19 it says oh by the way you're allowed to talk about the things which shall be hereafter praise the lord let's preach things that are to me now i say that because of this i want to stand here today right here and right now and tell you that brother william branham is my absolute because i have a proper revelation of who he is and what he did and my understanding is far far inferior to that if a man can be so predestinated by god take all the supernatural elements away not that we would but hypothetically speaking take the discernment away take the visions away take all the supernatural events away and just look at his footprints through the scripture and what he preached and it matches the scripture how foolish would i be to say i need to balance this man's ministry out with something else or maybe he was off in some other spot he did say this but how foolish would you be but i've heard those statements i literally set across a lunch table from a man what we would call a superpower in the message and two years before he fell away he made the comment to me that we have to understand that in order to properly understand brother branham's ministry we have to balance it out with all the men of god that was on the scene at that time and i was naive saints i admit i'm sorry i was naive i was like well that ain't right but maybe he meant something else two years later he completely falls away from the message but brother bryan says that's what the holy ghost was given to you for he says that little thing down inside of you that you get a little funny feeling when somebody says something he says that was the holy ghost given to you to keep you away from that thing but this is a superpower within the message and he would make that comment just over a lunch table and i'm like balance it out okay so in order for me to balance brother branham's ministry out and i know you all believe this i'm not trying to convince you of this i'm just wanting you to look and see how grateful we should be that we have a proper understanding but in order for me to balance something out with him that means i automatically have to take something else and use my intellect to reason and decide how to balance it out that was the whole point of god sending me a prophet [Music] so that i didn't have to do that because he knew if i did have to do that i wouldn't stand a chance so it was the whole purpose to get me out of that position thank god it bum-fuzzles me why people have an issue with having an absolute thank god i have an absolute i would be a disaster if i didn't have an absolute because then i would have to wonder if you were right or if i was right or if this other guy was right and all by the way he don't even believe that brother random was a prophet anymore you talk about being tossed to and fro this was god's grace to us but i say that because no doubt there's somebody that maybe just doesn't have a perfect understanding of that yet and maybe this will help you so i would never do away with the supernatural vindication never god did that why would i want to do away with it but i'm just saying hypothetically look what he did with the scriptures look what he did with the scriptures i don't want my own opinion i don't want my own opinion now and i'm not saying that to get you all right up and you know praise god yes that's right let's tear the walls down anybody that don't believe that's the antichrist i'm not i'm not trying to work you up i'm just saying that in honest humility i am so grateful and this is what i told our pastor around back before i came around i said i am just so grateful brother brandon says don't you ever take this message for granted but we do saints and don't try to tell me you don't because we do but then something like this will pop up and you'll do i mean this wasn't an in-depth study this was 15 minutes of god just having grace and mercy and revealing something to me look what he did and it's not even what i would say new i mean i'm sure somebody's already preached this before but just to me i started seeing with clarity oh my goodness look what he has done literally walking through the scriptures that to me is the vindication because i wasn't there to see the other i believe it with all of my heart but i'm here to see this and i don't care what else you have you can't take this away from me and i can see a man just in the simplicity of his message titles walking through the scriptures and fulfilling what malachi 4 was to do and what revelation 10 7 was to do i can see that just with the ability to read and god's faith in me that he put in me and i'm thankful for that and this blessed me so i wanted to share that with you we're going to come to a close here 1964 the identification identification of christ in all ages now remember hold that in your mind when brother branham preaches future home he don't have anywhere else to go i won't say you don't have anywhere else to go he's got very little room to go you understand he's only got one chapter to work with at the end of revelation and one verse to work with at the beginning of revelation so in 1964 he says the identific in the identification of christ in all ages heavenly father we are grateful to see the risen messiah 1900 years of all kinds of theology and movements but still in the darkness of it all you promised that you would appear here in the last days in this sodom day and you would you yourself make yourself known to the children of abraham the call the elected and here you are tonight after 1900 years listen to what he's saying here you are tonight here you are here you are here you are you are just as much just as much alive tonight as you was when you talk to the woman at the well it's god manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the self-same flesh brother chad just read this these two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so don't try to become the bride without believing the word so that the word and the church becomes the same the word and the church making it the bride the last sign god identifying himself the word in the church the last sign the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride the last sign the tabernacle of god is with men the last sign 1962 oneness brother brandon says the kingdom of god is god's word made power so just in case you were wondering what the kingdom of god is god's kingdom is his word made power that means his word fleshed out in your life made power what is the kingdom of god it's within you that kind of sounds like the tabernacle of god is with men kind of sounds like you are the city kind of sounds like you are the new jerusalem it kind of sounds like to me we may be living the last sign and we've only got one chapter left to go and then we have all of the things that are to be throughout eternity ephesians three you don't have to turn there i'm going to i'm going to go through this fast for time's sake but we're going to close here in just a minute i promise ephesians 3 verse 1 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote a four in a few words so how he made known to me of the mystery and i wrote to you a four in a few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ so paul is saying i know the mystery and i wrote to you in a few words before this is in chapter three so what do you do you go back a chapter ephesians 2 19 because he said i wrote to you about this in a few words before ephesians 2 19 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god the household of god the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles you're built you're built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone the chief cornerstone what do you use a cornerstone for you're building a house you're building a tabernacle in whom all the building now he just comes out and says it in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy temple remember what he was writing about in a few words before the mystery of god in whom all the buildings fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye build it together for a habitation of god through the spirit the tabernacle of god is with men there's no wonder he said it's done it's finished after that because that was the mystery and paul said i wrote to you about it a few words before seven or eight verses i wrote to you about the mystery of god a few words before the mystery the tabernacle of god is with men the second phase of his threefold purpose the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him this is revelation 1 as the musicians come this is revelation 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things which he saw listen to this statement that brother branham makes in the church age book the very beginning of the church book this book is usually termed the revelation of saint john but that is incorrect it is the revelation of jesus christ given to john for christians of all ages it is the only book this is what i want you to catch it is the only book in the entire bible that is written by jesus himself so we've got that it is the only book in the entire bible that is written by jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe now catch this jesus himself wrote this book through personally appearing to a scribe the funny part is is when the scribe which was john fell down to worship him he wouldn't receive worship but it was jesus christ himself personally appearing to john see where it's a razor's edge see where it's a razor's edge jesus christ himself personally appearing to the scribe but when the scribe falls down and tries to worship him and he says don't do it i'm a i'm of you i'm a brother but this is jesus personally appearing to you and write it down because it's true and it's faithful but don't worship me but write it down it's true and it's faithful and it's jesus personally appearing to you see the razor's edge see the razor's edge there's a scripture in the bible that says i will cause all men to come and worship at your feet bride worship i'll give you a couple minutes to recover why should that shock us that's what john tried to do to the angel that was representing jesus christ personally appearing to him because jesus christ is the word and the word was indwelling a prophet to personally appear to john and if you are the tabernacle of god why should it be such a shock that he would cause all men to come and worship at your feet they're not worshipping you but what they are worshiping remember i'm not saying praise if they start praising you we got a problem i said worship that's what the scripture says worship is to submit yourself to bow down to recognize that's right and i'm wrong you say i would never let anybody do that i'll say this that if your true bride you've already done it yourself because someday somebody came walking along your path and they said something you never heard before and you said where'd you get that at and they said right here in this book and you took the book and you read the book and you're like i give up my idea and i'm going to take that idea and i how did that get here by the way it's almost like jesus christ personally appeared to me himself see the razor's edge you can get off one side you can get off the other let's stand together we can get off one side we can get off the other but there's a truth there there's a truth there and it's the same truth that the angel represented please just go ahead and come brother it's the same truth that the angel represented he told john the word that i gave you it is true it is faithful it is right it will heavens and earth will pass away but that word won't fail you write it down don't worship me i'm simply one that's standing nearby while he does these things it's a razor's edge saints but it's true and it's possible if we will completely die to ourself and we will allow it to be true he didn't do all of this coincidentally and if he preached the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride brother chad said it very well the other day he said what he was really doing was he was also showing you your present home when he preached future home he's also showing you your present home and that's what he said in the message he says if i get anything over to you i'm trying to get over to you how god's redeemed you well why wouldn't you title the message how god redeemed you instead of future because he's walking through the scriptures and in order to show you your future home you first have to come to a proper understanding of your present home he was a true and a faithful witness and i thank god i thank god i am so grateful i am more grateful today than ever and as time goes on and we see the fallacies of men we are going to be more thankful and more thankful and more thankful that god in his simplicity could send us a prophet and a gift himself personally appearing to us remember john was us him personally appearing to us and he would place something within us his own faith to be able to recognize that and say that is my absolute that is nothing but the truth thank you god i so appreciate what god has done for us i want to read this last verse just so if you got sidetracked you'll remember this one thing and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and in verse 6 he says it is done and then i'm going to leave you with one question that's a good question you may have heard it before what time is it sirs what time is it sirs because we've only got one chapter left to work with and one verse in the chapter one to work with let's bow our heads precious lord jesus we just want to thank you once again father for your word lord we want to thank you as you said in your scripture that you would send us the gift of elijah so that we would not be cursed and father it would be one thing that if we would be physically cursed and smitten from the earth but god how much worse would it be that if we would be left on that same earth with nothing but our own understanding lord what a wreck we would be what a terrible miserable hell on earth that would be to have no absolute but just have to rely on our own intellect dear god i want to thank you tonight that you have sent us that gift that we do not have to be in that condition lord and that you have placed something within us that we can yield to that that we can recognize the gift that you have sent to us and we do not have an issue worshiping that lord worshiping the word you yourself that came through that the son of man lord we are so grateful we are the most grateful people on the face of the earth we worship you tonight lord we thank you for that may we never take that for granted lord may we never take it for granted that we have the ability to know the truth to have an absolute lord we thank you for that ministry we thank you father for the ministry that is now for further revealing itself and your people the bride lord we worship you tonight we are so grateful above all we're just so grateful lord and we worship you that we have a truth that we have a rock not just a foundation but now you have established walls and a roof and you have placed things inside of us lord we are so grateful that we can come and recognize our position in the scriptures that we are your tabernacle and that we are on the threshold of the millennium looking forward to things that are to be we worship you tonight lord we just commit the things that were spoken and the people to you father i pray that you would be with each and every one as they would go their separate ways tonight keep us safe on the roads lord just be with us lord if there's one here that would lack an understanding in anything that i've said father may you just be their portion may you just reveal yourself to them father we love you and we worship you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you brother if you'll sing oh it's already [Music] it's already [Music] victory is one and it's already done [Music] it's already [Music] the victory is one it's already done [Music] and i'm already [Applause] [Music] over amen praise the lord amen are you already his amen i thought the service this evening was so interesting because of a conversation i had through text today with uh brother stephen shimbo brother stephen shimbo said something to me on the uh solomon's temple and he and he goes to solomon's temple and he shows that there was 120 priests ministering at the dedication of solomon's temple and he made note of it and i asked him a question about the 120 priest and he tied it to the day of pentecost and i asked him a question and he made a statement all of a sudden things exploded for me he said there was the day that solomon's temple we know the temple is a type of the bride as the tabernacle's a type of christ the temple is the type of the bride because the tabernacle was one tent one laver one one altar one lamp stand one table but when you get to solomon's temple you've got ten lavers ten lampstands ten tables and ten is the number of the church five wise and five foolish so you can see one is male and one is female when you get to solomon's temple it's a type of the church many stones amen built together for a habitation of god so with the dedication of this temple there was 120 priests ministering and that the dedication the pillar of fire come in behind the veil and the smoke filled the temple until those 120 priests could not minister anymore but on the day of pentecost when god amen was going to anoint his new temple there was 120 in the upper room and the pillar of fire come in and the smoke so filled the room um theoretically that they could no longer even speak in their own language they could never no longer minister the way they were because now it was the dedication of the new temple amen because god wants to be tabernacled in man and god wants to dwell with man and have fellowship with man it's been a theme all through the bible [Music] i mean i was i was talking with brother ben around back i didn't know what he was going to preach on but i was just telling him that i've been i've been looking at the prayers of the prophet of god i've been looking at his prayers in the beginning of his sermons and at the end and the prayers i find fascinating what brother branham's asking for he he's asking that the people will get it that they'll see amen that they'll see what i've tried to say lord would you bring this reality into them lord would you bring this manifestation into them may the bride have their eyes open and he's praying amen not that the people will recognize him he's praying that the people will recognize who they are when brother branham starts talking about that now we have god in flesh he's saying now christ is manifest in his church and he begins to refer back to the plains of memory when god elohim would be in flesh and with his back to the tent with discern sarah and whenever brother madam's talking about that he is referring to his present stage manifestation that now god but he never makes it singular he always makes it plural but what we have now is god in the church because the goal was never for god to stop with that one man but the purpose was to bring it to a people and so brother branham when he's referring to now we see the presence of god with his people god back in flesh again and he every when he speaks of that you can only see that through the manifestation of the day and that's god in that prophet but brother branham never speaks singular he always speaks plural to the church in a whole because that was the whole point that's why if we leave that in that man we've missed the whole point of his ministry that's why if we make it singular when he didn't make it singular he made it plural we see it with singular in that day but the point was to show the wave sheep so that you would have faith in the process to bring you to the same place [Music] and because the point of his prayers is not that you would see him the point of his prayers is that you would see yourself what brother branham was asking god to show us is that we wouldn't recognize he was modified for in revelation 10 7 but that you would recognize that you're the tabernacle of god the place where deity wants to dwell and manifest through the bride [Music] so what i told ben around back not knowing what he was about to preach i said the question is is god answering our prayers for the prophet's prayers as god is opening our eyes and revealing himself to us he's answering our prayers surely but i believe he's honoring the prayers of that prophet who was praying for this day he was praying for us to see to believe to understand what he was trying to say and i believed in this day and this message tonight and in our hearts that god is honoring the prayers of that prophet from 50 some years ago and he's allowing us to see what he was saying what he was trying to get across and i say thank you lord when you want to talk about worthiness we're not worthy so the worthy one took our place and by his blood in the washing of his blood he makes us worthy so that we don't ever have to worry about worthy anymore how many times is the devil keeping us from our position because of worthiness the worthiness issues already been dealt with don't worry about it faults and failures and mishaps and hybridization it's all been paid for it's all under the blood god took care of it all so that we could have the faith in that sacrifice and the shed blood for us so that we could be who he called us to be without the devil putting all these thoughts in our minds it was already taken care of let it be taken care of and let god do what he wants to do in this day and just say god i see it in your word i see the pattern through the scripture i see what's supposed to be manifest in this day i believe what the prophet i receive it in the name of jesus christ let it be done in me mary had no worthiness to bring that prophecy to pass mary had no ability she wasn't worthy but yet she said beat unto me how many would like to say lord be it unto me that you'll tabernacle yourself in this flesh be it unto me according to your word be it unto me let it be according to what your prophet taught let it be according to what you wrote in your scriptures i believe it's for me and i believe it's for today i can't do it i'm not worthy enough i don't have any ability i'll never be good enough but i still believe it's true and i still believe it applies to me be it unto me o god let me be a tabernacle you can live in let me be a dwelling place a holy habitation for your presence for your spirit see friends if we don't accept it that way we'll never accept it if we wait to be good enough if we wait to see enough good works if we wait to see enough perfection in our life we will never come into the manifestation of the word because everything has to be done by faith and if you keep looking at yourself you'll never have a faith to step into this prophecy to manifest this part of the word but we have to do is look at what god has done look at what he did on calvary look at what he did when he sent a prophet look at what god has done so that we would have confidence enough to say it's the truth and i'm part of it by his grace not by my ability all of this was done so that you and i would have the faith to step into the word and say let it be in being [Music] praise be to god god could not take over mary until mary submitted to god until she believed what the angel said about her and when she believed what the angel said about her and surrendered to that word then the prophecy from 700 years began to take effect the same thing's happening today friends let's believe what god said through a prophet let's take it face value in the simplicity i was speaking to a couple brothers last sunday about the word and i was saying we we feel like we've become so advanced in revelation i mean we're growing in revelation this is true we're growing in revelation but we've come so advanced in our revelation that we've become childish enough just to take the word for the way it's written that's how advanced we've become that we can just read the bible and say that's the truth not advanced in higher intellectualism but the advancement in revelation is becoming simple becoming childlike to say when paul says you are the body of christ you can say that's what he meant it wasn't an allegory it wasn't theoretical it was the truth that's how high we've come in revelation we've become so great that we can just say you could read what a fourth grader could read and come to the same conclusion a fourth grader could come to and say that ain't nothing but the truth that's what it means to become great in revelation is to become simple enough to believe exactly what he said the same thing with the prophet just get simple enough to believe exactly what he said if he said that you are the habitation of god the place that god wants to live in the new jerusalem that's on
