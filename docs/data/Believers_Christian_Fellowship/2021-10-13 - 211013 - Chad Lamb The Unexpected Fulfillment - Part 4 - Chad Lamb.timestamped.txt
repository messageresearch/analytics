[9:05] amen
[9:06] amen thank you for praying with me on
[9:08] that
[9:09] let's read revelation chapter 5
[9:11] before we're seated and look at verse 1.
[9:17] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[9:19] sat on the throne a book written within
[9:21] and on the back side
[9:23] sealed with seven seals
[9:25] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[9:27] loud voice who was worthy to open the
[9:29] book and to loose the seals thereof
[9:32] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[9:34] neither under the earth was able to open
[9:36] the book neither to look thereon and i
[9:39] wept much because no man was found
[9:40] worthy to open and to read the book
[9:43] neither to look there on
[9:45] and one of the elders saith unto me
[9:47] weep not behold the lion of the tribe of
[9:50] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[9:53] to open the book and to loose the seven
[9:55] seals thereof and i beheld and low in
[9:58] the midst of the throne and of the four
[10:00] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[10:02] stood the lambs that had been slain
[10:03] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[10:05] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[10:07] unto all the earth and he came and took
[10:10] the book out of the right hand of him
[10:12] that sat upon the throne
[10:14] amen god bless you god bless the reading
[10:16] of his word as you're seated
[10:19] and then when we come to this i want to
[10:21] do just a little bit of review this will
[10:23] be part four of the unexpected
[10:25] fulfillment and i want to do just a
[10:27] little review from sunday and then move
[10:28] forward
[10:29] as we were but when we when we come to
[10:32] this revelation chapter 5 brother venom
[10:34] calls this passage the most sublime
[10:36] scripture in all the bible amen because
[10:39] the lamb is stepping forth to take the
[10:41] book and we know he teaches us that this
[10:43] book was the title deed to all of
[10:45] creation
[10:46] and this book was the title deed that
[10:48] adam lost amen
[10:50] so you have to recognize that that god
[10:52] never really wanted this book
[10:55] he didn't write the book for him amen he
[10:58] was the creator of all things he doesn't
[11:00] need a title deed for what he created
[11:02] amen
[11:03] if you create something you don't need a
[11:04] title deed for that to prove ownership
[11:06] you're the one who made it amen you
[11:08] could always make another one you don't
[11:09] need a title deed he didn't need a title
[11:12] deed but he created all of his creation
[11:14] amen and he put a man over all of it
[11:17] amen and he gave him the title deed to
[11:19] all creation so that he could rule all
[11:21] that god had created and he was ruling
[11:23] it as a god upon the earth until he fell
[11:26] by disobeying the word of god and when
[11:28] he did he lost the right amen to the
[11:30] title deed and and so it went back into
[11:33] the hand of the one who gave it and so
[11:35] because satan couldn't get his dirty
[11:38] hands on it it went back to the original
[11:40] owner and now god's been holding it but
[11:42] god doesn't want to hold this book amen
[11:45] he gave it to man and he wants men to
[11:47] have this book
[11:50] praise god so you have to realize god is
[11:52] not wanting to hold the book he's only
[11:54] holding the book long enough till the
[11:56] worthy one can come and take it
[11:59] amen so you've got to be able to cross
[12:02] the checklist you have to be a kinsmen
[12:04] redeemer so you have to be a near
[12:06] kinsman check amen so he's holding it
[12:08] until somebody can check the boxes on
[12:10] the list you have to be able to pay the
[12:13] price of redemption
[12:16] and jesus was the only one able to pay
[12:18] the price of redemption amen for he was
[12:20] created amen he was created in the womb
[12:22] of mary and he was the born virgin born
[12:25] amen he was pure and unadulterated and
[12:27] clean and lived a perfect life so his
[12:29] blood was the only human blood that
[12:31] could atone for all the other human
[12:33] beings
[12:34] so he was able to pay the price check he
[12:36] was able to meet the qualifications
[12:38] check and and he wanted to do it amen
[12:42] check final check
[12:45] and that that
[12:46] that title deed book amen was in the
[12:49] hand of him waiting for the one that can
[12:52] check all the boxes and come and take it
[12:53] out of his hand amen god has been
[12:56] desiring somebody to take that out of
[12:58] his hand
[12:59] praise be to god
[13:01] amen
[13:02] so we know here that a strong angel
[13:05] proclaimed with a loud voice who was
[13:07] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[13:09] seals and no man in heaven when the
[13:11] search goes out in heaven and earth and
[13:13] under the earth they were looking for a
[13:14] man there was no man it didn't say
[13:16] anything about angels there was all
[13:18] kinds of other created beatings there in
[13:20] the heavenlies amen and created beings
[13:22] on the earth but none of them the search
[13:24] wasn't through any of them the search
[13:26] was through man no man in heaven no man
[13:29] on earth no man under the earth they
[13:30] were searching through mankind to find
[13:33] the man that could take the book and
[13:34] there was no man in the search that was
[13:36] found worthy to take the book
[13:40] until a man stepped forth from the
[13:42] throne
[13:43] from the midst of the throne and it was
[13:44] the man christ jesus as the lamb that
[13:46] had been slain before the foundation of
[13:48] the world and he was worthy to take the
[13:50] book he was the near kinsman he could
[13:52] pay the price of redemption he met the
[13:54] qualifications to be a kinsmen redeemer
[13:57] and he was willing to do so
[14:01] so that's when
[14:03] john was told to weep not
[14:05] because there is one here
[14:07] that is going to take the book
[14:10] i want to read a few quotes out of the
[14:12] breach
[14:13] brother branham in paragraph 156 in the
[14:16] breach
[14:17] he says
[14:18] he saw one sitting upon the throne
[14:22] with his book and his hand and his right
[14:24] hand think of it
[14:25] now and then in this book was the title
[14:27] deed to redemption and it was sealed
[14:29] with seven seals and then an angel come
[14:31] forth a strong angel proclaim with a
[14:33] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[14:35] book to take the book who was able to
[14:38] open the seals who was able to open this
[14:41] book
[14:42] the angel asked it john saw it and he
[14:44] said now who is worthy let him and
[14:47] brother venom stop and said oh my maybe
[14:50] i'm just feeling this this away
[14:54] what's he feeling what's he getting
[14:55] excited about amen because when it came
[14:58] time to take the title deed book there
[15:00] has to be a strong angel that would call
[15:03] for a kinsman redeemer to come forth and
[15:05] the scene's already been played out in
[15:06] the bible amen so when it comes time for
[15:09] the kinsmen redeemer to take the book
[15:12] the first thing that has to come forth
[15:14] is a strong angel has to has to say who
[15:18] is worthy to take the book now brother
[15:20] branham is here in the breach and he's
[15:22] saying who is worthy to come and take
[15:24] this book amen he's coming to the
[15:26] preaching of the seals when he preaches
[15:28] the seals somebody's got to come and
[15:30] take that book that can loose those
[15:31] seals before brother branham can preach
[15:33] the seals
[15:34] so here he is in the breach the night
[15:36] before he's beginning the seals and he's
[15:38] saying who is worthy and there's what he
[15:41] says i want to read it again so we can
[15:43] catch it in context and it was sealed
[15:45] with seven seals and then an angel come
[15:47] forth a strong angel proclaimed with a
[15:49] loud voice who was worthy to open the
[15:51] book to take him to take the the book
[15:55] and who was able to open the seals who
[15:57] was able to open this book see the angel
[16:00] asked it john saw it and he said now who
[16:02] is worthy let him brother ben says it
[16:05] like that let him oh my
[16:08] maybe i'm just feeling this away amen
[16:12] maybe i'm just feeling this this away
[16:15] what's he feeling he knows it's time for
[16:17] the seals an angel has to say who's
[16:20] worthy that's what initiates the
[16:22] movement friends
[16:26] and god is reflecting on earth what's
[16:28] been happening in heaven and now there's
[16:30] a strong angel proclaiming let him come
[16:32] forth who is worthy let him let the
[16:34] worthy one come let the kinsmen redeemer
[16:36] let him come forth maybe i'm just
[16:39] feeling this this away friends i say no
[16:42] you weren't just feeling it this away
[16:43] amen god was displaying what he was
[16:46] coming to
[16:47] [Music]
[16:49] then again in the breach he says but
[16:50] john wept
[16:52] because there was nobody found nobody
[16:55] could do it
[16:56] and john wept here's what i think he
[16:58] wept for
[17:00] because if no one was worthy and could
[17:02] open this book of redemption
[17:04] the whole creation was lost
[17:11] here is the book
[17:12] here is the title deed and will be
[17:14] offered to the kinsman redeemer that can
[17:16] meet the qualification that's god's own
[17:18] law and he can't defile his law defy his
[17:21] law rather see god's god required a
[17:24] kinsmen redeemer who was worthy who was
[17:27] able to do it who had the substance to
[17:29] do it and the angel said now let that
[17:31] kinsman redeemer step forward
[17:36] oh praise god
[17:40] you know
[17:41] we have to have our eyes open to what's
[17:43] happened in our day
[17:45] because if not we're still thinking what
[17:47] will happen will come something will
[17:49] come something will happen friends it's
[17:51] already happened amen
[17:54] maybe i'm just feeling this this away
[17:57] but let him come forward now and you
[17:59] realize when john began to weep he says
[18:02] what was he weeping for he meant he was
[18:05] weeping but the man said this is why i
[18:06] think he was weeping because if nobody
[18:09] was found worthy to take that book amen
[18:11] when when the angel proclaimed who was
[18:14] worthy listen now there had been 2 000
[18:17] years and for 2 000 years nobody was
[18:19] stepping forward and nobody was stepping
[18:21] forward and the book was in his hand and
[18:22] nobody was moving nothing was happening
[18:25] amen and and there's nothing going on
[18:28] amen for 2 000 years but the time that
[18:31] it's time to take the book a strong
[18:33] angel has to proclaim who's worthy and
[18:35] john begins to weep because he realizes
[18:38] if nobody can take that book when it's
[18:40] time to take the book all of redemption
[18:43] is lost
[18:47] and here's the seventh angel on earth
[18:49] standing here in the breach
[18:51] the seventh angel the last one
[18:54] do we agree on that there can't be an
[18:57] eighth one
[18:58] so here's the seventh one
[19:00] and he's 50 some years old
[19:04] and he's the last one
[19:06] and this has to happen while he's on
[19:08] earth
[19:11] so you realize friends while that
[19:13] prophet is on earth the seventh angel
[19:16] messenger while he's on earth these
[19:19] seals have to open this has to transpire
[19:22] christ has to come and if it doesn't
[19:24] happen all of redemption is lost friends
[19:26] it is all lost if it doesn't happen
[19:28] while that seventh angel is on earth
[19:31] it's way bigger than we realize it's way
[19:34] more involved than we ever thought amen
[19:36] all of redemption was hinging on what
[19:38] was taking place in that seventh angel's
[19:40] ministry
[19:42] all of redemption was hinging on the
[19:44] fact that christ would come the lamb
[19:46] would step forward
[19:47] during the seventh angels ministry
[19:50] because it has to happen during his
[19:52] ministry while he's on earth it cannot
[19:54] happen after he dies
[19:57] so can you see there's a strong angel
[19:59] proclaiming let him come forth if
[20:01] there's one that can do it let him come
[20:03] forth because it can't happen after i'm
[20:05] gone it has to happen while i'm here
[20:11] if the seals wouldn't have come open
[20:12] friends why would we in the same the
[20:14] seventh angel died there would be
[20:17] redemption would be lost
[20:21] all that christ paid for will now be
[20:22] lost
[20:27] so much bigger than we ever thought
[20:30] and we thought it was pretty big
[20:33] so much more intense than we ever
[20:35] realized
[20:38] he was weeping because if nobody came
[20:41] forth at this time
[20:43] if nobody came forth at that time
[20:46] all of redemption is lost
[20:50] in paragraph 299
[20:53] of the breach he says
[20:55] talk about a jubilee
[20:57] amen talk about a time when the lamb
[21:00] walked forth see the books even sealed
[21:02] in heaven the mysteries are say is my
[21:04] name there i don't know i hope it is but
[21:06] if it is it was put on the book before
[21:08] the foundation of the world but the
[21:10] first thing that represented that
[21:12] redemption come the lamb that had been
[21:14] slain from the foundation of the world
[21:15] and he took the book glory opened the
[21:18] book and tore off the seals and sent it
[21:20] down to earth to his seventh angel to
[21:23] reveal it to his people
[21:28] can it happen later it can't happen
[21:30] later it's got to happen while the
[21:31] seventh angel's present
[21:35] he opened the book so the lamb had to
[21:37] come forth he had to open the book
[21:40] tiller off the seals sent it down to
[21:42] earth to his seventh angel to reveal it
[21:45] to his people and and if you read in
[21:47] your church or your seventh seal book if
[21:49] you pick up your seven seal book there
[21:51] is a an edit in there there's a
[21:53] parenthesis where they edited a
[21:55] statement and it says in their
[21:57] congregation greatly rejoices
[22:01] and if you listen on to the tape when
[22:03] brother branham comes to this part he
[22:04] said he opened the book tore off the
[22:06] seals sent it down to earth to his
[22:08] seventh angel to reveal it to his people
[22:10] the people erupt in praise why are they
[22:12] erupting in praise go read revelations 5
[22:16] and if you read revelation 5 you'll know
[22:18] exactly why they broke out and greatly
[22:20] rejoicing congregation greatly rejoices
[22:23] why they had to because the scene was
[22:25] unfolding friends
[22:31] there you are oh my what happened the
[22:34] screams the shouts the hallelujahs the
[22:37] anointing the power the glory the
[22:39] manifestations and then there's another
[22:41] injection of an edit and it says
[22:43] congregation continues to greatly
[22:46] rejoice why it's revelation chapter five
[22:49] amen
[22:51] it's the breach brother ben's preaching
[22:53] in the breach standing in the breach and
[22:55] what is a breach a breach is made a gap
[22:57] between two things that can be a breach
[23:00] but a breach is also a bursting force or
[23:02] a coming forth a breaking force
[23:07] something is happening
[23:09] in the breach
[23:11] said an old john who had been standing
[23:13] there our brother crying why he said
[23:16] everything in heaven everything in earth
[23:18] everything in the sea heard me holler
[23:20] amen blessing honor and might and power
[23:24] be to him that lives forever and ever
[23:27] talk about a happy time when them seals
[23:29] broke john must have looked in and seen
[23:31] past the curtain of time and said
[23:33] there's john
[23:34] oh he was so happy he said everything in
[23:37] heaven he must have really cried out
[23:39] didn't he everything in heaven
[23:41] everything in the earth everything
[23:42] beneath the earth every creature and
[23:44] everything else heard me saying amen
[23:47] blessings and glory and wisdom and power
[23:49] and might and riches belong to him
[23:52] amen
[23:56] so what does the lamb do when he steps
[23:58] forward he takes the book tears off the
[24:00] seals throws them down to the seventh
[24:02] church age messenger who reveals it to
[24:04] the people
[24:07] now you see how critical it was that the
[24:09] seals opened while brother brennam was
[24:11] alive
[24:15] what other option
[24:17] is there
[24:21] let's go to first corinthians
[24:26] praise be to god
[24:35] i want to look at this from some
[24:36] statements that i made on sunday and i
[24:39] want to look at this through the
[24:40] scripture
[24:42] from this perspective
[24:45] first corinthians 15
[24:47] and verse 12.
[24:54] now christ be preached that he rose from
[24:56] the dead
[24:57] how some say among you that there is no
[24:59] resurrection of the dead
[25:01] but if there be no resurrection of the
[25:02] dead then this christ not risen
[25:05] and if christ be not risen then is our
[25:07] preaching vain and your faith is also
[25:09] vain
[25:11] yea and we are found false witnesses of
[25:14] god because we have testified of god
[25:16] that he raised up christ whom he raised
[25:18] not up if so be that the dead rise not
[25:20] for if the dead rise not then is not
[25:22] christ raised and if christ be not
[25:25] raised your faith is vain and ye are yet
[25:28] in your sins
[25:31] then they also which are fallen asleep
[25:33] in christ are perished
[25:39] if in this life only we have hope in
[25:41] christ we're of all men
[25:43] most
[25:44] miserable
[25:46] what is paul preaching
[25:48] paul is now showing that christ had to
[25:51] die to pay the price of redemption but
[25:55] if christ
[25:56] died and paid the price of redemption
[25:58] but nothing happened after that
[26:01] then your faith is in vain and you're
[26:03] yet in your sins and those that died in
[26:05] christ have perished
[26:07] because there
[26:09] there is more to redemption than just
[26:11] paying the price
[26:14] so jesus paid the price of redemption
[26:17] nothing needs to be added to that price
[26:19] the full price was paid
[26:23] the full price was paid nothing needs to
[26:25] be added to that price but other things
[26:28] need to happen in the full cycle of
[26:30] redemption now christ he needs to raise
[26:33] again to prove that he was the one
[26:34] worthy to pay the price and if he didn't
[26:37] raise then those that sleep in christ
[26:38] they have perished and your faith is
[26:40] vain and you're yet in your sins
[26:43] so if he you know if you just stopped at
[26:46] calvary and didn't catch the next part
[26:48] in the plan and path of redemption and
[26:50] prophecy then everything is perished if
[26:53] he just died and didn't resurrect it
[26:55] then then you're yet in your sins
[26:59] but because he died and he resurrected
[27:02] now that you know that there's hope for
[27:04] a resurrection that the promise of life
[27:06] has been restored and we above all men
[27:09] are not most miserable we're not saved
[27:11] but doomed to die we're not saved but no
[27:13] no salvation of creation no resurrection
[27:16] no restoration back amen will never walk
[27:18] upon the earth again as they did in the
[27:20] garden of eden if he just died you're
[27:22] paid for everything's paid for but
[27:24] nothing's brought back to its position
[27:28] so there has to be more this this plan
[27:31] of redemption has to keep unfolding the
[27:33] fullness of redemption to come to a full
[27:35] restoration of what's been lost
[27:38] and then brother branham can come and
[27:40] take a a statement like he made in the
[27:42] breach concerning revelation chapter 5
[27:45] amen brother i'm saying in revelations
[27:47] chapter 5 that john was weeping amen
[27:50] because if nobody could claim to take
[27:52] this book all of redemption is lost he
[27:55] said how could all of redemption is lost
[27:57] he's already paid for it
[27:59] but he's paid for it but he hasn't
[28:01] claimed it yet it's paid for but not
[28:03] claimed
[28:05] so if he doesn't claim his redemption
[28:07] it's all lost it's like if you have
[28:09] something in the pawn shop you send in
[28:11] the check to pay the price for
[28:12] redemption and say i've sent this check
[28:14] in here i'll come and claim my
[28:16] redemption if you never claim it it
[28:18] wasn't redeemed fully
[28:21] the process isn't finished amen until
[28:23] it's claimed it's paid for but not
[28:25] claimed and it was paid for and never
[28:27] claimed was it redeemed
[28:30] it was partially well how do you have a
[28:32] partial redemption redemption is
[28:34] bringing back to its former state
[28:36] redemption means bring it back to the
[28:38] position it was in before
[28:41] so in order to complete redemption
[28:43] you've got to pay the price amen the one
[28:45] who paid the price has to resurrect to
[28:47] show that there's a power of restoration
[28:49] of bringing life back amen to bring it
[28:51] all back the way it was and then now he
[28:54] has to do a work of intercession amen
[28:56] because he's got to redeem those who
[28:58] would not fully believe the word
[29:02] is that right
[29:04] because in the seven church ages amen
[29:06] they would have partial revelation of
[29:07] the word they would hold on to the
[29:08] partial but there's many things that
[29:10] were contrary to the word amen they
[29:12] would still believe in trinitarian
[29:14] baptisms and the trinity doctrine and
[29:17] they wouldn't believe in holiness and
[29:18] all of these things they were they were
[29:20] not fully believing the word so because
[29:22] he had to fully redeem his bride he had
[29:25] to stay there in the role of
[29:26] intercession to cover for the sins of
[29:28] ignorance
[29:32] but if he never comes to claim his
[29:34] possession is redemption finished
[29:37] it's part of
[29:38] redemption and now through seven church
[29:41] ages he's there interceding amen
[29:45] mediating for the sins of ignorance amen
[29:47] so that his bride even though even
[29:50] though she is
[29:52] disbelieving portions of the word she is
[29:55] still redeemed because he's covering for
[29:58] her sins of ignorance
[30:00] and the portion he's revealed she's
[30:02] receiving that portion and grabbing hold
[30:05] of it and believing what's unlocked and
[30:07] disbelieving the part that's still
[30:08] locked
[30:10] because he's covering for the sins
[30:13] of ignorance
[30:15] but at this end of the seven church ages
[30:17] he's going to fully restore the word
[30:20] so that now you have to believe what's
[30:22] unlocked just like in every other age
[30:25] you had to believe what was unlocked and
[30:26] when you believed what was unlocked it
[30:28] was counted unto you for righteousness
[30:30] and you were part of redemption and he
[30:31] was covering for you
[30:34] but now he's come to the time when
[30:36] there's no longer partial but he's going
[30:37] to fully unlock and so when he fully
[30:40] unlocks he no longer needs to cover for
[30:42] ignorance now when you receive the fully
[30:44] unlocked part you received him and
[30:46] you're in redemption and now when he
[30:48] comes to fully reveal the word he comes
[30:50] to claim what he has redeemed
[30:55] because he's grabbing a bride to sit on
[30:57] the throne with him
[30:59] that's why amen the kingdom couldn't set
[31:02] in when christ died and when he
[31:04] resurrected you know i mean how hard
[31:06] would it be for him to come in the
[31:08] resurrection and show everybody the
[31:11] proof and evidence of his resurrection
[31:12] and stand before them how hard would it
[31:14] have been for him to take the throne of
[31:16] david right then
[31:18] they watched a man get crucified
[31:21] they watched him die they knew and if he
[31:24] could resurrect and prove to him that
[31:25] he's the one that died he could take the
[31:27] throne right then amen they tried to put
[31:29] him on the throne before his
[31:31] resurrection
[31:33] and after the evidence of resurrection
[31:34] but that's why after the resurrection he
[31:36] only showed himself to the disciples not
[31:38] to anybody else because they wouldn't
[31:40] want to take him and put him on the
[31:41] throne
[31:43] but he couldn't take the throne yet amen
[31:45] there was still half of him that hadn't
[31:47] been manifest yet
[31:50] and he had to wait to the female part to
[31:52] be manifest to be united back together
[31:54] amen so he could take the throne with
[31:57] the other part of himself
[32:00] which was his bride his wife
[32:03] and so for 2 000 years he's laying there
[32:06] covering for her covering for her
[32:08] covering for her covering for her until
[32:11] he can come and claim her because before
[32:13] he sets up that throne amen during the
[32:16] millennium he's got to have her with him
[32:18] and then they return back to set up the
[32:20] kingdom
[32:23] so now we understand by the message why
[32:25] these things
[32:27] have had to be
[32:28] the way they are
[32:32] that's why so
[32:34] many people
[32:36] they want to say
[32:37] all you need is this aspect of the
[32:40] gospel and if you get this aspect of the
[32:43] gospel that jesus died jesus died for
[32:45] your sin then everything's fine but what
[32:48] about the resurrection paul said it was
[32:50] needful too
[32:52] and without this
[32:54] this doesn't do you any good
[32:56] is that what paul said
[32:59] we're not making things up this is what
[33:00] paul said if he didn't raise again then
[33:03] you're still in your sins
[33:04] and your faith is in vain
[33:07] so you say all we need is calvary but no
[33:10] you need calvary and you need the
[33:11] resurrection
[33:13] according to the apostle paul
[33:15] who is the man that says i i i know
[33:18] nothing among you but jesus christ and
[33:19] him crucified paul's not saying the only
[33:21] thing i preach is jesus christ crucified
[33:24] that's the subject he's preaching as
[33:26] christ and that christ was crucified
[33:28] he's preaching christ that's what he's
[33:30] preaching
[33:31] because he's the one who preaches
[33:33] resurrection he's the one who preaches
[33:34] restoration he preaches all these other
[33:36] things is that right
[33:40] so when we stop the gospel here
[33:44] then we among all men are most miserable
[33:49] because he's come down to pay the price
[33:51] of redemption
[33:53] so that he can do the work of redemption
[33:55] so that he can claim what he redeemed
[33:58] it's the full picture friends
[34:01] and he's got to do it all and if we
[34:03] leave any of it out guess what
[34:06] all creations lost
[34:10] praise god
[34:12] let's go to revelation chapter 10.
[34:30] revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and i saw
[34:32] another mighty angel come down from
[34:34] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[34:36] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[34:38] was as it were the sun
[34:40] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[34:42] had in his hand a little book open and
[34:43] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[34:46] his left foot upon the earth i just want
[34:48] to stop there for a moment
[34:51] you know that the title of the sermon
[34:53] tonight is the unexpected fulfillment
[34:57] so when you read revelations 10 just as
[35:00] a human being in a carnal mind without
[35:02] knowing the revelation of the word when
[35:04] you read revelation 10 verses 1 and 2
[35:07] what would you be looking for
[35:10] what would you need to see in order to
[35:13] say this scripture has been fulfilled
[35:16] the carnal mind amen they're still
[35:18] looking for an enormous jesus christ
[35:24] to come down and so big that he can
[35:26] stand on the sea and on the land at the
[35:29] same time
[35:32] and that there'll be a literal cry that
[35:34] thunders out and everybody hears
[35:37] and they're looking for a literal
[35:39] fulfillment when it's spiritually
[35:41] fulfilled
[35:44] there's an unexpected fulfillment to
[35:46] revelation chapter two there's an
[35:47] unexpected fulfillment to revelation
[35:49] chapter five
[35:51] and an unexpected fulfillment to
[35:53] revelation chapter 10 it's not the way
[35:55] the carnal mind thinks it's going to be
[35:58] they're looking for an image amen a
[36:00] giant one feet like brass in a rope
[36:03] rainbow over his head amen
[36:05] they're looking for the battle of
[36:06] armageddon they believe that there will
[36:08] be a jesus sitting on a horse with a
[36:11] sword coming out of his mouth and he's
[36:13] he's running through the tanks and
[36:14] through the the army and the guys with
[36:16] m16s and all that and with a literal
[36:18] sword sticking out of a literal mouth
[36:20] he's cutting their heads off
[36:26] is that what we believe
[36:29] we need to send it as a mighty angel put
[36:30] one foot upon the land upon the sea what
[36:32] did we see
[36:34] how did we see it
[36:36] with what eyes did we see it
[36:42] see it's fulfilled in such an unexpected
[36:45] way
[36:47] not the way the carnal mind could ever
[36:49] put it together
[36:50] not the way the carnal mind could ever
[36:52] interpret these words you could read the
[36:54] words with literacy you could have
[36:56] intelligence enough to know the
[36:57] definition of each word but you have no
[37:00] idea how this is going to be fulfilled
[37:03] until god brings the fulfillment and he
[37:05] witnesses in your heart that that's the
[37:06] truth and then you say i see it
[37:10] with what eyes did you see it
[37:15] do you believe the mighty angels
[37:16] descended
[37:18] with one foot on land and one foot on
[37:20] sea do you do you believe he's cried as
[37:22] when a lion roareth amen when did you
[37:24] hear it with these ears and when did you
[37:26] see it with these eyes i mean how can
[37:28] you testify that it's happened with what
[37:30] witness can you witness that the only
[37:32] way is where the inward voice the the
[37:34] still small voice down with on the
[37:36] inside that says that's the truth amen
[37:42] he says
[37:43] going on to verse three and he cried
[37:45] with the loud voices when the lion
[37:46] roared and when he had cried seven
[37:48] thunders uttered their voices and when
[37:50] the seven thunders uttered their voices
[37:52] i was about to write and i heard a voice
[37:54] from heaven saying unto me seal up those
[37:57] things which is seven thunders uttered
[37:58] and write them not so now there's still
[38:00] an unexpected fulfillment of this now
[38:03] the carnal mind that's expecting him to
[38:05] come down as a giant image and stand
[38:08] with his legs spread way out to the sea
[38:10] and way out to the land in a giant image
[38:13] amen they expect him to roars when the
[38:15] lion wore and seven liberal thunders to
[38:17] thunder out and not realizing those
[38:20] seven thunders are sounding on earth one
[38:22] night monday night tuesday night
[38:25] wednesday night thursday night friday
[38:27] night saturday night sunday what was it
[38:30] it was the it was the sounding of the
[38:32] seven thunders why did the seven thunder
[38:35] sound because he come down any and he
[38:38] shouted with the loud voices when a lion
[38:40] roars and then seven thunder sounded
[38:42] right in a row
[38:46] what were we expecting
[38:48] when i was a little boy i can tell you
[38:50] what i was expecting because i i used to
[38:52] love the book of revelation it was a
[38:54] book i was attracted to as a small child
[38:56] i began reading the book of revelation
[38:58] when i was just a boy and i read it all
[39:00] the way through multiple times before i
[39:02] was a uh very much older
[39:04] and and i i had no idea what i was
[39:07] looking for i mean i didn't know idea
[39:09] what this would i was expecting the same
[39:11] thing everybody else expected a literal
[39:13] fulfillment of these scriptures that we
[39:15] live in the day that these scriptures
[39:17] are past
[39:21] they're in the past friends
[39:25] and what did we
[39:26] see we saw a little man from kentucky
[39:30] with a seventh grade education and then
[39:32] come to the pulpit monday night and say
[39:34] something happened in that little room i
[39:36] had it all wrong i was going back to old
[39:38] notes and i thought maybe this and i i
[39:40] was reading amen you know different
[39:42] books of different wines and then he
[39:44] came and he revealed it to me amen and
[39:46] turned me completely around
[39:50] and then i traced it down through the
[39:52] scriptures and now he starts bringing it
[39:54] he starts bringing the interpretation of
[39:56] what a white horse is amen and what a
[39:58] crown was given to him and what it means
[39:59] to have a bow with no arrows and what
[40:01] he's going to do and he goes right down
[40:03] through the scriptures and what's
[40:04] happening on monday night march 18th or
[40:07] whatever day it was amen the thunder was
[40:10] sounding right then
[40:13] it was an unexpected fulfillment but it
[40:16] was still a scriptural fulfillment
[40:22] and the seven thunders uttered their
[40:23] voices
[40:25] told them to write it not
[40:28] verse 5 and the angel which i saw stand
[40:31] upon the sea and upon the earth lifted
[40:32] up his hand to heaven and swear by him
[40:35] that liveth forever and ever who created
[40:37] heaven and the things that there and are
[40:39] in the earth and the things that therein
[40:41] are and the sea and the things which are
[40:43] therein and that there should be time no
[40:46] longer
[40:48] well when that voice sounds
[40:50] that's it time no longer
[40:53] it's done
[40:56] right we can all read the words
[40:59] i believe it's properly translated who
[41:01] believes it's properly translated
[41:04] but what did it mean time no more amen
[41:06] brother branham said that this is the
[41:08] opening of the seventh seal and seventh
[41:10] seal is the end time seal the end of all
[41:13] things amen time no more amen brother
[41:16] bram says it's marking the end of the
[41:18] end starting the beginning of the end
[41:20] time cycle starting the end of this then
[41:23] the end of that then the end of this and
[41:26] he explains it like a roman candle going
[41:28] on first it shoots out one star then out
[41:30] of that comes five and he's saying what
[41:32] is it the end of denominational systems
[41:36] that was the first thing to end right
[41:38] there at the sounding of those seven
[41:40] thunders the end of denominational
[41:41] systems the end of denominational ages
[41:44] then the end of this and the end of
[41:46] world gentile power is the end of a
[41:47] gentile domination the end of this and
[41:49] the end of this and the end of this and
[41:50] the end of this because why because the
[41:53] mighty angel had come amen he had
[41:55] descended amen with an open book in his
[41:57] hand he had roared as a king amen the
[42:00] king coming looking for his queen seven
[42:02] thunders uttered their voice and he said
[42:04] let there be time no more and it started
[42:06] the ending of everything
[42:11] that's the truth
[42:13] but that's not what we expected with the
[42:15] denominational reading of the word
[42:20] i say god help us not to ever have
[42:22] another denominational reading of your
[42:24] word
[42:27] there are still things i don't
[42:28] understand and there's still
[42:30] denominational ideas in my head and i
[42:32] want god to get every one of them out of
[42:34] me by the revelation of the true word
[42:38] the ability to read and understand
[42:39] language is not enough to know this
[42:41] bible
[42:43] it is not enough that's been the failure
[42:45] all the way through and it's still the
[42:47] failure today if we're relying on the
[42:49] ability to read if we're relying on our
[42:51] intellect to understand what the words
[42:53] actually mean and putting the meaning of
[42:54] words together and getting a literal
[42:56] interpretation of the word we will fail
[42:58] like everybody else has always failed
[43:00] amen that's not the way to understand
[43:02] the bible the bible is given by divine
[43:04] revelation upon the word
[43:06] amen
[43:07] [Music]
[43:10] praise be to god
[43:13] let's keep reading
[43:16] verse 7
[43:17] but in the days of the voice of the
[43:19] seventh angel
[43:21] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[43:23] of god should be finished as he hath
[43:24] declared to his servants
[43:26] the prophets
[43:28] brother branham again in the breach he
[43:30] says
[43:31] and when the seals are broken the
[43:32] mystery is revealed down comes the angel
[43:35] the messenger christ
[43:38] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[43:39] the sea with a rainbow over his head now
[43:41] remember this seventh angel is on earth
[43:44] at the time of this coming
[43:46] [Music]
[43:49] listen it's either true or it's not true
[43:51] we can't stand in between
[43:54] it's either the truth or it's not the
[43:55] truth the prophet even knew what he was
[43:56] talking about or he didn't know what he
[43:58] was talking about he declared to us the
[44:00] time of the fulfillment of these
[44:01] scriptures he was manifesting there the
[44:04] actual fulfillment of the scriptures was
[44:06] being manifested and declared before
[44:08] everyone's eyes but you can only see it
[44:11] with a different set of eyes you can
[44:13] only hear it with a different set of
[44:14] ears
[44:19] and so
[44:20] we have to make sure
[44:22] that we're looking for the unexpected
[44:24] fulfillment
[44:26] not the expected fulfillment
[44:28] if everybody knows how it's going to
[44:29] happen i'd look for another
[44:34] idea we start talking about future
[44:37] events i mean we love to talk about that
[44:38] i talk about that with brothers we love
[44:40] we love to bounce it around and talk
[44:41] about it
[44:43] but when most everybody else has the
[44:44] idea of how it's going to happen i'm
[44:46] thinking no that's not it
[44:50] i don't trust my own ideas i don't trust
[44:52] anybody else's ideas god interprets his
[44:54] word by bringing it to pass when he
[44:56] brings it to pass there's something down
[44:57] inside the elect that says that's it
[45:02] praise be to god
[45:04] now in the feast of trumpets i want to
[45:06] start talking on this and a direction
[45:08] here he said in the feast of trumpets he
[45:10] said
[45:11] how will the messiah the people that's
[45:13] believing him know it unless they're
[45:15] constantly in the word to know
[45:17] what he is
[45:19] daniel said the wise shall know him but
[45:20] the foolish the unwise wouldn't know
[45:22] they shall know their god now how he
[45:24] shall appear in the last days is to
[45:26] bring the people back to the word so
[45:28] that the bride will know her husband
[45:30] know her mate the revealed word
[45:34] that's why this has to happen so this is
[45:37] why he says he shall appear in the last
[45:39] days
[45:42] has he appeared
[45:45] he shall appear in the last days is to
[45:47] bring the people back to the word so
[45:50] that the bride will know her husband
[45:53] her mate the revealed word
[45:56] now listen when you talk about a mate a
[45:58] mate is a matching part
[46:01] your mate is a matching part when you
[46:04] find you know when you find you have a
[46:06] sock and the sock is lost in the wash
[46:08] you're looking for the mate to this sock
[46:11] so if it's a blue sock amen the gray
[46:13] sock is not a mate
[46:17] all right
[46:18] if it's a blue sock the blue sock of
[46:20] another brand is not a mate
[46:23] this is why when you first start
[46:24] teaching your children especially if you
[46:25] have sons to fold the laundry you sleep
[46:28] seeing a lot of non-mates mated together
[46:31] because they don't care there's two
[46:32] socks pulling them over throw them away
[46:34] and you get them out and one goes
[46:35] halfway up your calf and the other one's
[46:36] down around your ankle you're like
[46:37] what's wrong with my socks
[46:40] it's not a mate
[46:42] a mate is a matching part
[46:45] he's appeared in these last days
[46:48] is to re bring him back to the word so
[46:50] that the the bride will know her mate
[46:53] her matching part
[46:56] the word coming to the word the eagle to
[46:58] the eagle that she will recognize her
[47:01] matching part she's got to be brought
[47:03] back to the word so she will recognize
[47:04] her matching part
[47:06] her husband her mate
[47:09] which is
[47:10] the revealed word
[47:12] so if the revealed word is her mate then
[47:14] she must also be
[47:19] if the blue soccers are made then the
[47:20] blue sock must be your mate
[47:23] if the revealed word is her mate then
[47:25] she must be the
[47:26] revealed word
[47:28] [Applause]
[47:30] oh i like it simple friends
[47:34] i like it simple
[47:37] let's look at second corinthians chapter
[47:39] 11.
[47:53] ii corinthians 11 and 2
[47:56] for i am jealous over you with godly
[47:58] jealousy for i have espoused you to one
[48:00] husband that i may present you as a
[48:02] chaste virgin to christ
[48:03] but i fear lest by any means as the
[48:05] serpent beguiled eve through septility
[48:07] to your mind should your mind should be
[48:09] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[48:11] christ so the apostle paul now is is
[48:15] he's got a duty and his duty is to
[48:18] espouse a virgin bride to christ and and
[48:22] he's worried about her staying pure
[48:26] he's concerned he's jealous over her
[48:29] with godly jealousy because he is a
[48:31] spouse to one husband that he might
[48:33] present her a chaste virgin he's nervous
[48:35] that she won't keep her chastity
[48:38] he wants to make sure he presents her a
[48:40] chase of urgent that she won't be
[48:42] beguiled like evil's begotten so this is
[48:44] paul this is this is what paul is
[48:47] anxious over in the first age that he is
[48:49] espoused a bride to christ and he wants
[48:52] to present her a chaste virgin so he's
[48:54] trying to get her to stay with the
[48:55] original word
[48:57] and there was other voices already
[48:58] creeping in in that day and he's trying
[49:00] to get them to quit listening to those
[49:02] voices and come back to stay with the
[49:04] original word that they originally
[49:06] received because he wants to present her
[49:08] a chaste virgin he doesn't want her to
[49:10] be beguiled by leaving the word the same
[49:12] way eve was begotten by leaving the word
[49:16] so paul was here to espouse a bride and
[49:19] to keep her chased by keeping her with
[49:21] the original word
[49:24] but we know that that that church
[49:26] eventually failed by the word and so set
[49:29] up the cycle of the seven church ages
[49:32] brother brown says in marriage and
[49:34] divorce he said and the bride will be a
[49:36] lovely little lady of the word
[49:39] paul was wanting
[49:41] paul was wanting to present to christ a
[49:43] chaste virgin
[49:44] what would take her chastity by leaving
[49:47] the original word
[49:50] so now christ god is going to present
[49:53] the bride will be a lovely little lady
[49:55] of the word
[49:57] because she'll be brought back to the
[49:58] original word
[50:00] amen shall be purified by the washing of
[50:02] water of the original word to bring her
[50:04] back to an original word position to
[50:07] original word state by the washing of
[50:09] the water of the original word
[50:11] the pure word
[50:13] to bring her back into a virgin
[50:15] condition
[50:16] and the bride will be a lovely little
[50:18] lady of the word unadulterated and not
[50:20] touched by any man's organization any
[50:22] man-made theory she'll be purely
[50:24] unadulterated bride of the word amen
[50:27] amen i hope you get that out on the air
[50:29] she will be the pregnant daughter of god
[50:36] let's go to galatians chapter 4.
[50:44] verse 19.
[50:48] we're listening to the apostle paul
[50:50] again
[50:51] in galatians 4 19 or yeah 419 he says my
[50:55] little children of whom i travail in
[50:57] birth again until christ be formed in
[50:59] you
[51:00] so paul is travailing again and he's
[51:03] trying what's he trying to produce he's
[51:06] trying to produce a man a chaste virgin
[51:09] for christ but he's also wanting christ
[51:12] amen to be formed in them
[51:17] who i travail in birth again until
[51:18] christ be formed in you he was trying to
[51:21] present a chaste version of christ to
[51:22] bury the two amen so christ can be
[51:25] formed in them
[51:28] and we're going to find out this is the
[51:29] exact thing that brother branham brings
[51:31] us right back to amen brings us back to
[51:34] the original word to wash us from all
[51:36] the prostitute spirits amen to bring us
[51:38] back to the by the original word by the
[51:41] washing of the pure word to a pure
[51:43] condition to be presented to christ amen
[51:45] so that christ can be formed in us
[51:49] to this end time church
[51:51] because that was the goal for the first
[51:52] church but she fell so there's a
[51:54] restoration back to the first so that
[51:56] they can do what the first church failed
[51:58] to do
[52:02] in the pergamon church age
[52:04] out of the church age book
[52:06] he says from a little group of the true
[52:08] seed of the word
[52:10] god will present christ with a beloved
[52:12] bride now this isn't brother brennam
[52:13] speaking this is the part of pick up
[52:15] your pen and write when the angel told
[52:17] him to pick up his pen and he picked it
[52:18] up and he just began to write when he
[52:19] was done he went back and read and this
[52:21] this is a part that's it's italicized in
[52:23] the church age book so from a little
[52:26] group of the true seed of the word god
[52:27] will present christ with a beloved bride
[52:29] she is a virgin of his word she is
[52:32] virgin because she knows no man made
[52:33] creeds or dogmas
[52:35] by and through the members of the bride
[52:37] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[52:39] of god to be made manifest in the virgin
[52:42] the word of promise came to the virgin
[52:45] mary so now he's running a parallel
[52:46] tract between mary and this end time
[52:48] bride
[52:50] the word of promise came to the virgin
[52:52] mary but that word of promise was he
[52:55] himself to be made manifest
[52:58] so what's going to happen in this day
[53:00] when he presents christ with a virgin
[53:03] bride amen amen she is going to be
[53:06] impregnated amen she is going to be what
[53:09] came to mary it was he himself to be
[53:11] manifest how was it manifest it was
[53:13] manifest in mary amen the word came to
[53:16] mary it was in mary how much of the word
[53:19] was in mary all the word was in mary
[53:22] all of that promise for that day was in
[53:24] mary and it began to grow and it began
[53:26] to come and finally it came forth from
[53:28] mary and when it came forth from mary it
[53:30] was immanuel it was the sun that was
[53:32] with us the sun that was born the
[53:34] fulfillment of the word
[53:36] through mary
[53:37] and god and god is running a parallel
[53:40] tract here he said the word of promise
[53:41] came to the virgin mary but that word of
[53:43] promise was he himself to be made
[53:45] manifest so the word that has come to us
[53:48] in this day what is it i mean is it
[53:50] doctrines is it understanding is it is
[53:52] it more teachings no it's he himself to
[53:55] be made manifest
[53:57] that's what's come to us in this day is
[53:59] he himself has come to us to be made
[54:02] manifest
[54:05] god was made manifest he himself acted
[54:07] at that time and fulfilled his own word
[54:09] of promise in the virgin
[54:11] it was an angel that had brought her the
[54:12] message but the angel's message was the
[54:14] word of god isaiah 9 6.
[54:16] he fulfilled at that time all that was
[54:18] written of him because she accepted his
[54:20] word to her
[54:23] the members of the virgin bride will
[54:25] love him and they will have his
[54:26] potentials for he is their head and all
[54:28] the power belongs to him they are
[54:30] subject to him as the members of our
[54:32] bodies are subject to our heads
[54:34] notice the harmony of the father and the
[54:36] son jesus never did anything until it
[54:38] was first showed him by the father john
[54:40] 5 19.
[54:42] this harmony is now to exist between the
[54:44] groom and his bride he shows her his
[54:46] word of life she receives it she never
[54:48] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[54:50] not even death for if the seed be
[54:52] planted the water will raise it up again
[54:55] here is the secret of this the word is
[54:57] in the bride as it was in mary
[55:02] where's the word at
[55:04] where is the word
[55:05] it's in the bride
[55:07] what's what is the word he himself to be
[55:10] made manifest where is it it's in the
[55:12] bride that's why she will be the
[55:14] pregnant daughter of god because she's
[55:16] pregnanted with the word she's carrying
[55:18] the life of the word within her
[55:22] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[55:24] knows what he wants done with the word
[55:25] she performs the command of the word in
[55:27] his name for she has thus saith the lord
[55:29] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[55:32] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[55:34] planted and watered it comes to full
[55:36] harvest serving its purpose
[55:38] those in the bride do only his will no
[55:40] one can make them do otherwise they have
[55:43] thus saith the lord or they keep still
[55:45] they know that it has to be god in them
[55:47] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[55:49] he did not complete all his work while
[55:51] in his earthly ministry so now he works
[55:53] in and through the bride i want you to
[55:56] catch that part above all else he did
[55:58] not complete all his work in his earthly
[56:01] ministry
[56:03] what he didn't get it all done
[56:07] he didn't get it he didn't complete his
[56:09] work all of his work in his earthly
[56:11] ministry
[56:14] and so
[56:16] now he works in and through the bride
[56:19] who's working where he's working through
[56:22] her
[56:22] where is he at in her
[56:25] she has the word just like mary had the
[56:27] word where's the word the words in her
[56:30] where is he working in her he didn't
[56:32] finish his work now he's working in her
[56:35] who's working he's working where is he
[56:38] working in her where is he at in her
[56:40] where is he working in her where's the
[56:42] manifestation in her
[56:48] praise be to god
[56:50] so what are we looking for in the son of
[56:53] man ministry
[56:54] where is it amen when it says in the
[56:56] days that the son of man revealed in the
[56:58] coming of the son of man where is it we
[57:00] saw it revealed amen which is the
[57:02] ministry of jesus christ himself brother
[57:04] brennan said the son of man ministry is
[57:05] the ministry of jesus christ himself we
[57:07] saw that in that man
[57:10] in brother branham but but brother
[57:13] branham told us amen that it manifests
[57:15] so that it could unite the head and the
[57:17] body amen so they could come together to
[57:19] do what to reproduce the son of man
[57:21] again
[57:24] where is that revealing of the son of
[57:26] man today amen
[57:28] where is it
[57:29] it was the coming of the son of man so
[57:31] we've got the coming of the son of man
[57:32] so now where is the son of man because
[57:35] when we first saw the son of man it was
[57:37] in a form of jesus christ of nazareth
[57:39] now there's been the coming of the son
[57:40] of man and a revealing of the son of man
[57:42] so i want to see him if you want to see
[57:44] him don't look for the previous
[57:45] manifestation that that's an expectation
[57:48] there's a fulfillment of that prophecy
[57:51] but not the way you expected it
[57:57] did god fulfill is he fulfilling his
[57:58] word
[58:00] is luke 17 30 fulfilled and being
[58:02] fulfilled absolutely is the cutting of
[58:04] the son of man being fulfilled
[58:06] absolutely how how's it being fulfilled
[58:08] well you know it's fulfilled and brother
[58:09] branham so the son of man came and then
[58:11] went
[58:16] he's still here
[58:20] who's here
[58:21] the same one that was the mighty angel
[58:22] that came down
[58:24] where is he
[58:26] he's big enough to put his land his foot
[58:28] on land and seat so you can't hide him
[58:29] in your pocket
[58:32] where is he at
[58:35] he's in her
[58:37] [Music]
[58:39] he didn't complete all his work while in
[58:41] his early ministry so now he works in
[58:43] and through the bride she knows that for
[58:45] it was not yet time for him to do
[58:46] certain things that he must now do
[58:50] but he will now
[58:51] fulfill through the bride
[58:53] that work which he left for this
[58:56] specific
[58:57] time
[59:02] oh praise god
[59:05] i want to move like lightning but i got
[59:07] to stop i got to go slow
[59:10] when jesus was here
[59:12] and it come time for his manifestation
[59:14] he comes to jordan when he comes to
[59:16] jordan then then john the baptist the
[59:19] forerunner is here and the forerunner is
[59:20] here is declaring the coming
[59:23] and when the forerunner is here he's
[59:24] pointing to the coming so that all can
[59:26] recognize that that what was prophesied
[59:28] is now here he saw the dove descend and
[59:30] rest upon him and he makes a declaration
[59:33] behold the lamb of god
[59:34] so the forerunner now points to what he
[59:37] was in for running and after he points
[59:39] to what he's four running then he knows
[59:40] shortly after that it's time for him to
[59:42] decrease so that this can increase
[59:45] we've seen a repeat of that and then
[59:47] then jesus goes off to enter his
[59:49] ministry but first thing he has to do is
[59:51] he has to be tested by the word so jesus
[59:54] goes why is he he's the last adam amen
[59:57] there's been many that's tried to be
[59:59] restore what adam lost amen there's many
[1:00:01] sons of god that have come down and done
[1:00:03] mighty works for the for god moses came
[1:00:05] down noah came down david came down amen
[1:00:08] but they failed they failed they failed
[1:00:09] because they were all hybrid born
[1:00:12] but now comes one comes from the hand of
[1:00:15] god amen
[1:00:17] through a virgin birth and now jesus
[1:00:20] christ is standing here the last adam
[1:00:22] amen and the original adam fell by the
[1:00:24] word amen so this adam now has to be
[1:00:27] tested by the word and he goes to the
[1:00:29] wilderness to be tested by the word and
[1:00:32] he doesn't fail by the word and all
[1:00:34] through his life he's destined and he
[1:00:35] doesn't fail by the word
[1:00:40] but if the bridegroom has to be tested
[1:00:43] by the word what does the bride have to
[1:00:45] go through
[1:00:48] so there's a testing time friends
[1:00:50] there's a period of testing will we stay
[1:00:52] with the word or will we do what the
[1:00:54] first eve did what we do with the first
[1:00:56] stage then the second age and the third
[1:00:58] or will this bride stand she's
[1:01:00] predestinated to this stand
[1:01:03] but in order to prove that she's
[1:01:05] predestinated to the stand she must go
[1:01:07] through the word test
[1:01:09] she must be tested by the word
[1:01:13] and so now
[1:01:15] he's finished
[1:01:17] the atom part
[1:01:20] and now he's doing the eve part
[1:01:24] because friends it's not you and i
[1:01:26] that's standing this test
[1:01:29] it's him and us
[1:01:31] it is him in us
[1:01:34] he's fulfilling the other
[1:01:36] parts
[1:01:38] let's go to colossians chapter one
[1:01:52] colossians chapter 1 verse 26
[1:01:56] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:01:58] ages and from generations but now has
[1:02:00] made manifest to his saints to whom god
[1:02:02] would make known what is the riches of
[1:02:04] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:02:06] gentiles which is christ in you
[1:02:09] the hope of glory
[1:02:11] where is he at he's in her
[1:02:14] where is he working from from her who's
[1:02:17] he working through he's going through
[1:02:18] her he's manifest him now he's
[1:02:21] manifesting her it's him and her doing
[1:02:24] the manifesting of she it's he who's
[1:02:27] manifesting she
[1:02:29] because you can't do it amen no human
[1:02:32] being can do it it takes him himself to
[1:02:34] do it
[1:02:35] that's why he's finishing his work now
[1:02:38] in her
[1:02:41] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:02:42] revealed
[1:02:43] brother man says look christ in you
[1:02:45] makes him the center of the life of the
[1:02:47] revelation
[1:02:49] christ's life in you makes him the
[1:02:50] center of the revelation christ in the
[1:02:53] bible makes the bible the complete
[1:02:54] revelation of christ
[1:02:57] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:03:00] revelation of the whole
[1:03:02] thing
[1:03:05] listen listen we're not making this up
[1:03:08] the prophet of god is saying this
[1:03:11] he says christ's life in you makes him
[1:03:13] the center of the revelation christ in
[1:03:15] the bible
[1:03:17] makes the bible the complete revelation
[1:03:19] of christ
[1:03:21] if you take christ the anointing out of
[1:03:23] the bible the bible's not the complete
[1:03:24] revelation of christ so there's a book
[1:03:26] sitting on the shelf and that book
[1:03:27] sitting on the shelf has the potential
[1:03:29] to be the revelation of christ but it's
[1:03:31] just ink blots on paper friends
[1:03:35] you take off the material bible and if
[1:03:37] you don't have christ the anointing in
[1:03:39] this bible then you don't have the
[1:03:40] complete revelation of christ christ in
[1:03:43] the bible
[1:03:44] makes the bible the complete revelation
[1:03:46] of christ you can't just take a bible
[1:03:49] and leave christ out of the bible and
[1:03:51] read it with no anointing of christ and
[1:03:53] have this be the complete revelation of
[1:03:54] christ
[1:03:56] it's only the complete revelation of
[1:03:58] christ when christ is in the bible amen
[1:04:00] that's why when brother branham saw the
[1:04:02] opening of those seals he says my bible
[1:04:04] became a new book to me because now the
[1:04:06] mystery of the entire bible is unlocked
[1:04:08] now christ in the entire bible
[1:04:12] makes the entire bible the revelation of
[1:04:14] christ
[1:04:17] i mean look at a prophet who's been
[1:04:18] reading his bible all of his life and a
[1:04:20] true prophet of god receiving true
[1:04:22] revelation on the word and tying
[1:04:24] together all the loose ends at the
[1:04:26] opening of the seven seals his bible
[1:04:28] became a new book to him
[1:04:30] because now it was the full revelation
[1:04:32] of christ in the bible made the bible
[1:04:35] the complete revelation of christ
[1:04:40] see why me intellectualism fails and
[1:04:42] fails and fails and fails and cannot
[1:04:45] work
[1:04:47] has to be by revelation
[1:04:51] i'm afraid too many times we try to make
[1:04:53] this we try to make this message
[1:04:56] intellectual
[1:04:59] like a really good bible study can make
[1:05:02] somebody a believer
[1:05:04] a really good bible study can convince
[1:05:07] somebody that you're right but cannot
[1:05:09] make them a believer
[1:05:13] how many people through bible studies
[1:05:15] and teaching were convinced that we were
[1:05:18] right amen get baptized come to the
[1:05:20] church believe the word and a few few
[1:05:23] years later months later weeks later
[1:05:24] however they take off and go living for
[1:05:26] the world and reject it and call it they
[1:05:28] chose they never came to the ceiling
[1:05:30] amen they never had a they never had the
[1:05:32] revelation of the word that this is
[1:05:34] christ
[1:05:38] so we've tried to intellectualize the
[1:05:41] message just preach the message and the
[1:05:42] believers will believe
[1:05:46] amen that doesn't mean we shouldn't be
[1:05:48] true to the word and it shouldn't do
[1:05:50] bible studies we shouldn't teach we do
[1:05:52] all of those things but none of those
[1:05:54] things will produce believers amen
[1:05:56] believers are produced by god amen
[1:06:01] so
[1:06:02] now christ in the bible
[1:06:04] makes the bible the complete revelation
[1:06:06] of christ
[1:06:08] christ in you
[1:06:11] makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:06:13] whole thing
[1:06:15] oh praise be to god
[1:06:17] see what god is trying to do
[1:06:21] god is not trying to get a better
[1:06:23] understanding of the bible
[1:06:26] god is trying to get christ in you to be
[1:06:28] the revelation of the whole thing
[1:06:31] what whole thing
[1:06:32] this whole thing
[1:06:34] christ in you makes you the revelation
[1:06:36] of the whole thing see what god is
[1:06:38] trying to do
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:43] what is the new birth then well brother
[1:06:44] branham what is the new birth it is the
[1:06:46] revelation of jesus christ personally to
[1:06:48] you amen now you joined a church you
[1:06:50] shook a hand you done something
[1:06:52] different you said a creed you promised
[1:06:53] to live a code of rules but christ the
[1:06:55] bible he is the word that was revealed
[1:06:57] to you and no matter what anybody says
[1:07:00] what takes place it's christ pastor
[1:07:02] priest whatever it might be it's christ
[1:07:04] in you that is the revelation that the
[1:07:06] church was built upon
[1:07:10] praise god
[1:07:12] and things that are to be is now if we
[1:07:14] are those attributes of god we cannot
[1:07:16] live by creeds we cannot live by
[1:07:19] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:07:21] word because the bride is part of the
[1:07:23] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[1:07:25] husband therefore we must be that word
[1:07:28] bride and what is that word bride the
[1:07:31] manifestation of this hour
[1:07:33] the bride not a creed or a denomination
[1:07:35] but a living oracle of god a living
[1:07:38] attribute of god displaying to the world
[1:07:40] the attributes of god
[1:07:42] in the formation of the bride that's to
[1:07:44] be expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:07:47] living
[1:07:48] he didn't finish his work he's doing it
[1:07:50] now
[1:07:51] what is the word right the manifestation
[1:07:53] of this hour the living or oracle of god
[1:07:56] expressing to the world
[1:07:58] the attributes of god
[1:08:01] now in the message it is the rising of
[1:08:03] the sun
[1:08:07] he says now
[1:08:09] this is just a short sentence so stay
[1:08:11] tuned
[1:08:12] catch it
[1:08:14] let's dial in
[1:08:16] turn up the hearing aids and dial it all
[1:08:18] in
[1:08:19] pay close attention focus
[1:08:22] how can the bride come
[1:08:24] and fail to manifest everything that was
[1:08:26] promised of him
[1:08:28] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[1:08:31] the bride
[1:08:35] i'm going to say that
[1:08:36] again how can the bride come and fail to
[1:08:39] manifest everything was promised of him
[1:08:42] and the groom come
[1:08:44] did the groom come
[1:08:46] has the groom come
[1:08:48] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[1:08:51] the bride
[1:08:55] has the groom come
[1:08:58] where is he
[1:09:00] he's the bride
[1:09:04] where is he hiding
[1:09:05] in her
[1:09:07] amen the word would come in the
[1:09:09] fulfillment where was it hiding in mary
[1:09:12] the word has come to fulfillment to this
[1:09:14] day where is it hiding in her
[1:09:17] how could the group come and he wouldn't
[1:09:20] be the bride he didn't say be in the
[1:09:22] bride be the bride
[1:09:26] let's turn to second kings chapter two
[1:09:37] second kings chapter 2
[1:09:46] in verse 9. we're going to talk about
[1:09:49] elisha and elijah
[1:09:52] verse 9 and it came to pass
[1:09:54] when they were gone over that elijah
[1:09:56] said unto elisha ask what i shall do for
[1:09:59] thee
[1:09:59] before i be taken away from thee and
[1:10:01] elijah said i pray thee let a double
[1:10:03] portion of thy spirit be upon me and he
[1:10:05] said thou has asked a hard thing
[1:10:07] nevertheless if thou see me when i am
[1:10:09] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[1:10:11] but if not it shall not be so
[1:10:13] and it came to pass as they still went
[1:10:15] on and taught that behold there appeared
[1:10:18] a chariot of fire and horses of fire and
[1:10:19] parted them both asunder and elijah went
[1:10:22] up by a whirlwind into heaven
[1:10:24] and elisha saw and he cried my father my
[1:10:26] father the chariot of israel and the
[1:10:28] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[1:10:30] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[1:10:32] he rent them in two pieces and he took
[1:10:34] off also the mantle of elijah that fell
[1:10:37] from him and he went back and stood by
[1:10:39] the bank of jordan
[1:10:40] and he took the mantle of elijah and
[1:10:42] felt that fell from him and he smote the
[1:10:43] waters and said where is the lord god of
[1:10:46] elijah and when he had also had smitten
[1:10:48] the waters they parted hither and
[1:10:50] thither and elisha went over and when
[1:10:52] the sons of the prophets which were to
[1:10:54] view at jericho
[1:10:56] saw him they said the spirit of elijah
[1:10:59] doth rest on elisha
[1:11:02] they they this is exactly the
[1:11:04] fulfillment of the prophecy amen
[1:11:06] fulfillment of what elijah told elisha
[1:11:08] elijah
[1:11:10] asked elisha what would you want he said
[1:11:11] i want a double portion of the spirit
[1:11:13] that's in you and he said you've asked a
[1:11:15] hard thing but if you see me go amen
[1:11:17] it'll come upon you amen so elisha was
[1:11:19] there when he went up in a whirlwind and
[1:11:21] when he went up in a whirlwind his
[1:11:23] mental he left he left laying there amen
[1:11:25] and elisha saw him go so now
[1:11:28] elisha has a double portion of the
[1:11:30] spirit and he goes forth and he takes
[1:11:32] the man on he smites the water and it
[1:11:34] splits and he walks across and all the
[1:11:36] prophets that are jericho all the
[1:11:38] preachers that at jericho they say that
[1:11:40] spirit of elijah now rests on elisha
[1:11:44] you got it that's it
[1:11:47] now look
[1:11:53] i'm going to go verse 4 15 again and
[1:11:55] when the sons of the prophets which were
[1:11:57] to view it jericho saw him they they
[1:11:59] said the spirit of elijah death rest on
[1:12:01] elisha and they came to meet him and
[1:12:03] bowed themselves to the ground before
[1:12:05] him and they said unto them behold now
[1:12:07] there be with thy servants fifty strong
[1:12:09] men let them go we pray thee and seek
[1:12:11] thy master lest per adventure the spirit
[1:12:13] of the lord had taken him up and cast
[1:12:15] him upon some mountain or unto some
[1:12:17] valley and he said
[1:12:19] he said you shall not send he said don't
[1:12:21] go
[1:12:23] and when they urged him to he was
[1:12:24] ashamed he said sinned they sent
[1:12:26] therefore fifty men and they sought
[1:12:28] three days but found him not and when
[1:12:29] they came again to him for he terry to
[1:12:31] jericho he said unto them did i not say
[1:12:34] unto you go not
[1:12:36] they comes forth now elijah is now gone
[1:12:40] he saw him go elisha knows elijah is
[1:12:43] gone
[1:12:45] elijah knows a lot elisha knows elijah's
[1:12:48] gone amen and he comes forth and now
[1:12:51] they see amen that the spirit of elijah
[1:12:54] rests upon elisha but they they don't
[1:12:56] understand what's taking place and
[1:12:58] they're still looking for a physical
[1:13:00] body
[1:13:02] they're looking for the physical body of
[1:13:04] elijah amen they don't think they can go
[1:13:06] on without it they need a physical
[1:13:08] something and they don't realize that
[1:13:10] elijah was standing right there with him
[1:13:12] and he was in elisha
[1:13:14] and they're looking for elijah that's
[1:13:16] why when they ask elisha if they can go
[1:13:18] elijah said don't go elisha knows where
[1:13:20] elijah's at amen he saw that physical
[1:13:23] body go but that spirit came back and
[1:13:25] elijah was there with elijah there was
[1:13:28] no reason to go looking for anything
[1:13:30] else and he proved it by being able to
[1:13:33] take that mantle that office of a
[1:13:35] prophet the smite the one depart him
[1:13:37] amen exposing the 12 stones doing the
[1:13:39] same thing that elijah had done before
[1:13:42] in revealing the word and they
[1:13:43] recognized hey you're doing just like
[1:13:45] the prophet did hey but we need
[1:13:48] something we need something physical
[1:13:49] this has to be christ this is the holy
[1:13:51] spirit but we're looking for a form
[1:13:53] don't look for a form don't go looking
[1:13:56] anywhere else we know where he's at
[1:14:00] they took 50 men they went looking for
[1:14:03] three days they come back he said did i
[1:14:05] tell you not to go
[1:14:08] see
[1:14:09] we're looking so many people are looking
[1:14:11] for something physical they want the
[1:14:13] physical this and the physical that
[1:14:15] they're looking for christ they're
[1:14:17] looking for the groom and they don't
[1:14:18] know where the groom is the groom's come
[1:14:21] and he's the bride
[1:14:24] elisha brother said elijah and elisha is
[1:14:27] christ and the bride elisha standing
[1:14:29] here with the same spirit that was in
[1:14:31] elijah is now here amen in full measure
[1:14:34] in his bride amen and somebody's going
[1:14:37] off wandering in the wilderness looking
[1:14:39] for the groom to come
[1:14:42] looking for his body looking for
[1:14:44] something physical and they don't
[1:14:45] realize the life that was there is here
[1:14:48] amen what was there in that
[1:14:49] manifestation is here in this
[1:14:50] manifestation it's a continuation
[1:14:56] but it wasn't what they expected
[1:14:59] and they they were looking for the wrong
[1:15:01] thing because they didn't realize
[1:15:03] that what they were looking for was
[1:15:05] standing in front of them
[1:15:08] we'll go hunt up elijah one of the
[1:15:10] spirit of the lord dropped him on a
[1:15:11] mountain we've got to go find him
[1:15:13] and elisha knows what's right here
[1:15:15] elisha knows
[1:15:17] he says don't go don't waste your time
[1:15:18] you're running all over the place for
[1:15:20] nothing

[1:15:41] praise god
[1:15:45] and choosing of a bride
[1:15:50] brother branham says
[1:15:52] we find today the modern church of
[1:15:54] modern world church the world church
[1:15:56] and also the spiritual church are both
[1:15:58] pregnant to give birth to sons and one
[1:15:59] of them a denominational birth is going
[1:16:02] to give one day one day to these days
[1:16:04] one of these days at the world council
[1:16:07] of churches which will produce to the
[1:16:08] world the antichrist through a
[1:16:10] denomination that's exactly the truth
[1:16:12] i may not live to see it i believe i
[1:16:14] will but you young people remember that
[1:16:15] you heard a minister say that that's
[1:16:18] finally wind up and that's the mark of
[1:16:20] the beast when she forms the world
[1:16:21] council of churches and she gives birth
[1:16:23] to her son the antichrist
[1:16:25] the other is pregnanted by the word of
[1:16:27] god and will bring forth the body the
[1:16:29] finished body of jesus christ which is
[1:16:32] his bride
[1:16:36] praise be to god
[1:16:38] an invisible union brother brandon said
[1:16:40] do you remember when it went down the
[1:16:42] grain began to ripen then you find
[1:16:43] before that grain can ripen everything

[1:16:49] is in the grain again what is it just
[1:16:51] exactly like the same grain that went in
[1:16:53] the ground the same
[1:16:55] jesus

[1:17:00] what are we looking for amen if you go
[1:17:04] go looking for that amen that that
[1:17:07] mighty angel that came down he had to
[1:17:09] come down when the seventh when the
[1:17:11] seventh church age messenger when the
[1:17:12] seventh angel was here on earth so go
[1:17:14] looking for him don't go looking for him

[1:17:19] seeing don't put off in the future he's
[1:17:21] here

[1:17:29] let's go to revelation chapter 10. i'm
[1:17:30] just going to finish with this
[1:17:33] revelation chapter 10.
[1:17:46] revelation 10 and 8
[1:17:50] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:17:51] spake unto me again and said go and take
[1:17:53] the little book
[1:17:55] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:17:56] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:17:58] earth
[1:17:59] and i went into the angel and said unto
[1:18:01] him give me the little book
[1:18:03] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:18:05] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:18:07] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:18:09] honey
[1:18:10] and i took the little book out of the
[1:18:11] angel's hand and i ate it up and it was
[1:18:13] in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon
[1:18:15] as i had eaten it in my belly it was
[1:18:17] bitter
[1:18:18] and he said unto me
[1:18:19] thou must prophesy again
[1:18:21] before many peoples and nations and
[1:18:24] tongues
[1:18:25] and kings
[1:18:28] i'd like to say it this way
[1:18:32] in revelation 10 8-11
[1:18:35] the journey of the book
[1:18:37] has ended
[1:18:40] the final
[1:18:41] destination
[1:18:43] of that book
[1:18:45] was in her
[1:18:50] the book that adam had that adam lost
[1:18:52] went to the hand of the original creator
[1:18:54] been holding it there for six thousand
[1:18:56] years amen waiting for a kinsmen
[1:18:58] redeemer the kinsmen come he paid the
[1:19:00] price of redemption he resurrected to
[1:19:02] prove the restoration of life amen come
[1:19:04] down through seven church ages and at
[1:19:06] the end of it all mighty angel comes
[1:19:08] down with an open book in his hand and
[1:19:09] there's a voice from heaven telling john
[1:19:11] which is a type of the bride go and take
[1:19:13] that book that you couldn't look at that
[1:19:15] no man could look at read that look upon
[1:19:17] it touch it there was new we were
[1:19:19] absolutely this book was off limits to
[1:19:21] mankind
[1:19:22] but when the kinsmen redeemer stepped
[1:19:24] forth and the mighty angel brought that
[1:19:26] little book down and tore them seals off
[1:19:28] and threw it down to a seventh church
[1:19:29] eight messenger who revealed it to his
[1:19:31] people they were there gobbling up the
[1:19:32] book what book went from adam to god
[1:19:35] from god to the lamb from the lamb to
[1:19:38] the seventh angel into you and i friends
[1:19:40] and it's the final destination of the
[1:19:42] book amen
[1:19:44] god had a plan for that book and that
[1:19:47] book was the revelation of jesus christ
[1:19:49] and it's made manifest in this day and
[1:19:51] where is that little book where can i
[1:19:53] get that little book amen each one of us
[1:19:55] had had to take our place and go to the
[1:19:57] mighty angel that we recognize as here
[1:20:00] now with the open book and take the book
[1:20:02] and eat it up and now we've become the
[1:20:04] book
[1:20:07] this is the mystery of god revealed in
[1:20:10] this day what is being revealed that
[1:20:12] christ is going to have a bride and that
[1:20:14] bride and him are going to be united as
[1:20:16] one and they're very soon to be restored
[1:20:18] to the throne of david where are you
[1:20:21] you're here revealing the bride part of
[1:20:23] that book
[1:20:26] the book is journeyed and journeyed and
[1:20:28] journeyed but now there's a resting
[1:20:30] place for that book in the end time
[1:20:32] bride and she's here to prophesy again
[1:20:34] what's she going to prophesy she's going
[1:20:36] to prophesy that book that's the book of
[1:20:38] redemption that's the plan of redemption
[1:20:40] from before the foundation of the world
[1:20:42] and she's here prophesying again the
[1:20:45] revelations of that book
[1:20:49] what are we looking for friends
[1:20:52] what's what do we do what am i watching
[1:20:55] for it's all around us friends it's
[1:20:58] going on all around us how could the
[1:21:01] groom come and not be the bride
[1:21:04] he's united with her and won what was
[1:21:05] john doing within that book he was
[1:21:07] becoming one with the book amen he was
[1:21:09] receiving the revelation of christ and
[1:21:11] becoming one with christ
[1:21:15] now if you want to know the words in the
[1:21:17] book
[1:21:20] it's being revealed and it's being
[1:21:21] manifested
[1:21:23] through those who have eaten the book
[1:21:26] those who have eaten the book are
[1:21:27] revealing the contents of the book
[1:21:31] it's standing before our eyes it's daily
[1:21:34] walking through the markets daily
[1:21:36] walking around coming to church driving
[1:21:38] down the road what is it the content of
[1:21:40] that book as being the revelation
[1:21:42] contained in that book is being made
[1:21:43] manifest in a many member bride which is
[1:21:46] the body of jesus christ that's being
[1:21:47] completed today
[1:21:51] because adam's body wasn't complete till
[1:21:53] his wife come forth and we were united
[1:21:54] back together then adam was complete
[1:21:56] christ wasn't complete till his bride's
[1:21:58] come out and been united back together
[1:22:00] then the body of christ is complete
[1:22:02] because these two are one
[1:22:04] the two are one
[1:22:09] i had to say the book is finding its
[1:22:11] resting place
[1:22:13] now
[1:22:15] god didn't want that book
[1:22:19] god wanted man to have that book
[1:22:23] and i say today
[1:22:25] god wants you to have that book
[1:22:29] that from adam
[1:22:31] to god
[1:22:33] from god
[1:22:34] to the lamb
[1:22:36] from the lamb through the seventh angel
[1:22:38] messenger
[1:22:40] to me
[1:22:43] is that too much to believe
[1:22:46] is that impossible
[1:22:47] is that not a living reality
[1:22:49] it may be too much for some to believe
[1:22:51] but i believe it
[1:22:54] i've eaten it it was sweet in my mouth
[1:22:56] bitter in my belly i'm prophesying of it
[1:22:58] again tonight amen this is a living
[1:23:01] living oracle of god testifying of a
[1:23:03] living book
[1:23:08] she is him
[1:23:12] what are we looking for
[1:23:13] let's not run around like those looking
[1:23:15] for elijah but let's recognize what's
[1:23:17] standing right here
[1:23:20] i want to read one more scripture as we
[1:23:22] close musicians you can go ahead and
[1:23:24] make your way up if you don't mind first
[1:23:26] corinthians chapter 15.
[1:23:40] first corinthians chapter 15
[1:23:42] verse 9
[1:23:45] for i am least of the apostles that i am
[1:23:47] not meat to be called an apostle because
[1:23:49] i persecuted the church of god
[1:23:52] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:23:57] you know what i'm not worthy to be a
[1:23:59] bride
[1:24:01] i'm not worthy to be the manifestation
[1:24:03] of christ on earth i'm not worthy of
[1:24:05] that
[1:24:06] are you worthy of that
[1:24:08] if you raise your hand come see me after
[1:24:10] church
[1:24:13] but by the grace of god i am what i am i
[1:24:15] cannot deny what i am i cannot deny
[1:24:18] what's been revealed i cannot deny what
[1:24:20] my heart resonates as this is nothing
[1:24:22] but the truth i cannot deny it but by
[1:24:25] the grace of god i am what i am not
[1:24:27] merit not worthiness not ability we've
[1:24:29] got none of those things friend we're
[1:24:31] the least likely amongst them all as
[1:24:33] least likely as an ignorant fisherman
[1:24:35] was the day god chose him amen but i was
[1:24:37] already in that book before i was the
[1:24:39] ignorant one before i was the the
[1:24:41] backwash of society i was already in
[1:24:43] that book
[1:24:45] and i believe it
[1:24:47] that by the grace of god i am
[1:24:50] what i am
[1:24:53] let's all stand
[1:25:00] when god first will say wrote that book
[1:25:04] because it's not paper
[1:25:07] we've got
[1:25:08] i think
[1:25:10] sufficiently god has showed to us that
[1:25:12] we have to stop thinking carnal earthy
[1:25:15] thoughts
[1:25:16] it wasn't paper friends
[1:25:19] amen it was the mystery of god
[1:25:23] it wasn't paper it was the record of
[1:25:26] christ amen
[1:25:27] it was the revelation of jesus christ it
[1:25:30] was what was in the back part of god's
[1:25:32] mind from before the foundation world it
[1:25:33] wasn't paper friends
[1:25:36] but when god first had the fondness nine
[1:25:38] he knew what the destination of that
[1:25:40] book would be
[1:25:43] he knew that you would be here and that
[1:25:44] book would be in you
[1:25:47] amen and so we've been ordained to this
[1:25:50] hour we've been equipped for this hour
[1:25:51] we've been called to this hour amen
[1:25:53] there's nothing to be nervous about
[1:25:55] there's nothing to be afraid about all
[1:25:57] we have to do is keep feeding on the
[1:25:59] word and letting him manifest himself
[1:26:03] it's him manifesting himself as her it's
[1:26:06] not you being her it's him being her
[1:26:10] we've got to get our thinking right amen
[1:26:12] all we're doing is surrendering to the
[1:26:14] life that's come to us and the life of
[1:26:16] the word that's in us when we were
[1:26:17] surrendered to that it's him displaying
[1:26:20] her through you it's not you displaying
[1:26:23] her you can't do it you'll mess it up
[1:26:26] again it has to be him playing both
[1:26:28] parts amen of the drama he was here as
[1:26:31] the bridegroom now he's here as the
[1:26:33] bride because why could the groom come
[1:26:35] and not be the bride
[1:26:38] he can't come and be the groom again
[1:26:40] he's already been the groom now it's act
[1:26:42] 2.
[1:26:47] and how could the groom come and be the
[1:26:48] groom again he's done it
[1:26:50] but now he comes and he is he's the
[1:26:52] bride
[1:26:55] and then the next time it'll be bride
[1:26:57] and groom to restore the kingdom
[1:27:00] act three
[1:27:04] oh praise god
[1:27:07] i thank god for this word friends
[1:27:10] the book is finding
[1:27:12] its destination
[1:27:14] let's pray
[1:27:16] lord jesus we thank you for your
[1:27:18] goodness lord
[1:27:20] for your mercy that you've extended to
[1:27:22] us
[1:27:24] for without you lord we can do nothing
[1:27:28] but with you all things are possible
[1:27:32] lord in ourselves we can be nothing
[1:27:35] but failures
[1:27:37] but with you
[1:27:39] we can be the bride
[1:27:42] we can be the manifestation of you upon
[1:27:44] earth
[1:27:45] if you live through us
[1:27:48] without you all we could be was a
[1:27:50] hypocrite
[1:27:51] an empty sepulchre
[1:27:54] something that's whitewashed and
[1:27:55] pretending
[1:27:57] that's not what will get it done in this
[1:27:59] hour lord
[1:28:00] but with you
[1:28:02] we can be the manifestation of this hour
[1:28:06] god i pray that you would take these
[1:28:07] humble vessels
[1:28:09] that you've ordained before the
[1:28:10] foundation of the world
[1:28:12] and that you will do in them and through
[1:28:14] them things that we've never thought of
[1:28:15] lord
[1:28:17] to manifest yourself in this hour
[1:28:20] may the content of the book be on
[1:28:22] display in our lives
[1:28:24] lord show yourself
[1:28:26] show yourself to this generation
[1:28:29] and show yourself through these vessels
[1:28:31] lord
[1:28:33] god we trust in you to do the work that
[1:28:35] you've
[1:28:36] promised to do in this day
[1:28:39] you're looking for preeminence so that
[1:28:41] you can do it
[1:28:44] lord we're asking that you would take
[1:28:45] preeminence in us we're giving you
[1:28:47] preeminence
[1:28:48] so you can do what you've ordained to be
[1:28:50] done in this hour through these vessels
[1:28:53] that the supernatural might be manifest
[1:28:56] through the natural
[1:28:58] that the real reality lord may come
[1:29:00] through this reality
[1:29:03] and it may be on display
[1:29:06] for always surrender to you and ask that
[1:29:08] you would do this work in jesus christ's
[1:29:10] name
[1:29:11] take us from here as we walk in this
[1:29:13] life
[1:29:14] may you walk in us
[1:29:16] and live in us
[1:29:18] manifest through us
[1:29:20] because there's only way that it's
[1:29:21] possible as if it's you doing it through
[1:29:24] us
[1:29:25] we ask your blessing in jesus christ's
[1:29:27] name
[1:29:29] amen

[1:31:17] looking at the fulfillment
[1:31:19] it wasn't what the world expects it's
[1:31:21] not though those who read it what they
[1:31:23] expect but it's the reality of the
[1:31:25] fulfillment of the word of god that is
[1:31:27] the manifestation
[1:31:29] of this hour
[1:31:32] and let's be encouraged by the word and
