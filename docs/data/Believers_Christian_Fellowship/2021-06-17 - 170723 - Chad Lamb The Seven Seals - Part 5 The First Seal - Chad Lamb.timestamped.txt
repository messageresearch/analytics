[0:00] praise the lord it's good to see you all
[0:03] here this morning it's good to be here
[0:04] this morning
[0:06] amen we're going to continue on where
[0:08] we've been
[0:09] starting last sunday with the seven
[0:11] seals so if you could take your bibles
[0:13] and let's just start right away in the
[0:15] second corinthians read one scripture
[0:18] while you're standing
[0:19] while you're turning there i just want
[0:20] to make mention of our youth meeting
[0:22] this past friday night we did
[0:24] questions and answers with all of the
[0:26] youth and i was
[0:27] so blessed to hear the questions that
[0:30] our youth asked
[0:31] i mean i remember i remember back when
[0:34] brother branham preached the seven seals
[0:36] and he asked through the week he said
[0:38] now if you have questions concerning
[0:39] these seals
[0:40] put them in at the end and and the
[0:42] questions that came
[0:44] were were so childish they were so
[0:47] carnal they they were so
[0:48] not about the seven seals that when you
[0:50] hear brother ben reading them you feel
[0:52] sorry for him
[0:53] because he says several times but but
[0:55] then we have a youth meeting where their
[0:57] youth
[0:58] ages 13 and up are asking questions and
[1:00] these questions would blow away most
[1:02] theologians today
[1:04] how do these youth even know to ask
[1:06] these questions why are they even
[1:08] interested in this it just shows that
[1:10] god is preparing his bride his
[1:12] whole bride he's calling us higher he's
[1:14] preparing us for a rapture
[1:16] so we had a wonderful time i think we
[1:18] answered questions for over two hours
[1:19] and
[1:20] and they had submitted them ahead of
[1:22] time written them out and given them to
[1:23] me and
[1:24] it was wonderful and i thought it was a
[1:26] blessing we had more coming in so we're
[1:28] going to have to do it again in a couple
[1:29] months but
[1:30] it was a real blessing we should be
[1:32] really proud of our young people around
[1:33] here
[1:34] they're really getting a hold of the
[1:35] word and getting interested in the word
[1:38] i always thought that was excellent
[1:40] let's go to second corinthians
[1:43] uh chapter 11 verse 1.
[1:48] second corinthians chapter 11 verse 1.
[1:53] wood to god you would bear with me a
[1:55] little in my falling and indeed bear
[1:57] with me for i am jealous over you with
[1:59] godly jealousy
[2:00] for i have espoused you to one husband
[2:03] that i may present you as a chaste
[2:04] virgin to christ
[2:06] but i fear lest by any means as the
[2:08] serpent begowed eve through his
[2:09] septility
[2:10] so your mind should be corrupted from
[2:12] the simplicity
[2:13] that is in christ amen there's two
[2:17] different words there
[2:18] that i want to think about as subtility
[2:20] and simplicity amen let's just bow our
[2:23] heads
[2:24] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[2:26] for your word lord we've come to this
[2:28] time lord where
[2:30] where we've looked forward to this time
[2:31] of hearing you lord
[2:33] hearing from you communing with you
[2:35] around your word
[2:36] and we're asking now that you would come
[2:38] in a supernatural way by the power of
[2:40] your holy spirit
[2:41] to pick up a gift that you've laid in a
[2:43] vessel of clay that you would use that
[2:45] gift lord to begin to speak to us your
[2:47] eternal words lord
[2:49] break to us the word the bread of life
[2:51] lord that we might
[2:52] have strength to sustain in the journey
[2:54] that we might grow thereby
[2:56] and become all that you've called for us
[2:57] to be in this last day
[2:59] we love you we give you preeminence in
[3:01] this place and ask lord that you would
[3:02] have your liberty in jesus christ's name
[3:05] we pray
[3:06] amen you can be seated
[3:09] amen i just want to remember that the
[3:13] deacons told me that we have a family
[3:15] visiting
[3:16] they're from the congo and they've moved
[3:19] to to the united states and they live in
[3:21] fort
[3:21] wayne so they visited and so they're
[3:24] they're back in the father's nursery now
[3:25] with brother emmanuel who's interpreting
[3:28] the service into french live
[3:30] so i'm going to try to be very careful
[3:32] for brother emanuel and not go too fast
[3:35] still pull pull but i'm going to try my
[3:38] best not to go too fast
[3:40] for brother emmanuel but just forgive me
[3:43] now brother emmanuel forgive me now
[3:46] amen praise the lord so
[3:50] we see here that paul is worried
[3:53] he's jealous over a virgin
[3:56] a virgin church that he's presenting to
[3:58] christ and he's here in the first church
[4:00] age talking about this
[4:02] but he's concerned about something he's
[4:04] concerned
[4:05] that the the serpent that will will
[4:08] deceive
[4:09] this bride like he deceived the first
[4:12] bride he says but i fear that's by any
[4:15] means as the serpent begot eve
[4:17] through his septility this word
[4:19] subtility means cunningness or
[4:21] craftiness
[4:22] he's shrewd and cunning and intelligent
[4:25] in the ways of the world
[4:26] and he used that cunningness to deceive
[4:29] eve
[4:30] so you see eve was deceived by reason
[4:33] by reasoning you know the devil never
[4:36] came
[4:36] and told her something that that sounded
[4:38] ignorant that didn't didn't sound
[4:40] childish
[4:41] but he came in a way it was so uh
[4:44] it was so intelligent it was so cunning
[4:48] it was crafty and it was wise and it was
[4:50] subtle
[4:51] and and that's why she was deceived eve
[4:54] wasn't deceived
[4:55] because she was seeking to do evil eve
[4:57] was deceived because along the path
[4:59] enjoying the garden
[5:01] living in the paradise of god satan came
[5:03] in and he was trying to disrupt the work
[5:06] of god
[5:06] so he was trying to find a vessel in
[5:08] which he could work and and he found the
[5:11] serpent
[5:11] and the serpent was so close to man you
[5:14] have to find he's always getting as
[5:15] close as he can possibly get
[5:18] satan you don't have to worry amen you
[5:20] don't have to worry about
[5:22] satan trying to grab you and drag you
[5:25] into a bar room somewhere
[5:26] try to grab you into a house of
[5:29] prostitution that's not the problem
[5:31] amen what he's trying to do he's coming
[5:32] in with cunning craftiness
[5:34] and he's coming in so close as close as
[5:36] he can possibly
[5:38] get because he wants to be wherever god
[5:40] is he wants to usurp god's throne usurp
[5:42] god's authority
[5:44] so he's getting as close as he possibly
[5:46] can
[5:47] so so we the the problem is you know we
[5:50] get
[5:50] caught up in our minds as human beings
[5:52] and fighting the devil and
[5:54] and fighting him in places he's not at
[5:58] you know we want to we want to we want
[6:00] to fight for
[6:01] uh uh to abolish drugs we want to fight
[6:05] the the opium addiction we want to fight
[6:08] uh drug abuse we want to fight
[6:10] uh ting pregnancy we want to fight all
[6:12] of these things
[6:13] and brother branham said these are all
[6:15] symptoms of one cause
[6:17] and that one causes unbelief in god's
[6:19] word caused all of those things and so
[6:21] we're trying to fight the devil
[6:22] in places he's not at where is he at
[6:25] he's always right here
[6:26] trying to get deviation from the true
[6:28] word that's where he's working
[6:30] once he gets you to deviate from the
[6:32] true word your own human nature will
[6:34] take you to the drug house we'll take
[6:35] you to the house of prostitution or the
[6:37] gambling casino
[6:38] that's your own fallen nature we'll take
[6:40] you there that's not where he's at
[6:42] that's not where we should be fighting
[6:44] not picketing casinos that's not the
[6:46] problem we should be picketing false
[6:48] churches we should be picketing those
[6:50] who who are encountering craftiness
[6:52] deceived by the word of god
[6:55] that's the problem the problem is not
[6:58] what what what everybody else seems to
[7:00] be fighting
[7:01] you're just beating the air because
[7:02] that's not the issue
[7:05] he didn't come to eve amen
[7:08] and and he came with the word
[7:12] and he tried to bring a slight deviation
[7:15] to the word if we go ahead and bring up
[7:18] the powerpoint please
[7:19] i am going to make myself go slow not
[7:22] just because we have visitors or getting
[7:24] interpretation but because
[7:26] i don't want to lose anybody here i want
[7:28] to
[7:29] i want to back up if we could all turn
[7:32] to the book of revelation together
[7:35] uh i'm trying so hard to force myself
[7:39] i mean last night it was 11 o'clock at
[7:41] night and i'm pacing the floor at my
[7:42] house
[7:43] i'm i'm as nervous as the cat in the dog
[7:45] pound because
[7:47] i i don't know how to get all of this
[7:50] information
[7:51] out this little tube you know out this
[7:52] little hole we've got to do it in
[7:54] bite-sized chunks and i'm just saying
[7:55] god
[7:56] what what what tomorrow what are we
[7:58] going to do so really in many ways i've
[8:00] come to the pulpit all filled up
[8:02] and i'm trusting god to just bring out
[8:04] whatever he wants to bring out
[8:06] so i'm depending on you to pull pull
[8:08] from the source and see what god will
[8:10] speak to us today
[8:11] but i don't want to go too fast because
[8:13] we've got plenty of time to minister on
[8:15] this
[8:16] we're going to be ministering on this
[8:17] subject for a while and so nobody get in
[8:19] a hurry
[8:21] i'm saying that for myself what i would
[8:24] like to do
[8:25] is i'd like to bring you all over to my
[8:26] house i'd like to sit in a chair for six
[8:28] hours and start breaking this down
[8:30] that's what i that's my preferred method
[8:32] that's what i would like to do
[8:34] but but this is god's way and we're
[8:36] gonna go god's way
[8:38] let's go to revelations chapter 4. i'm
[8:40] going to read a lengthy reading but
[8:42] let's all read together and stay tuned
[8:44] in
[8:46] revelations chapter 4 it says after this
[8:50] i looked and behold a door was open in
[8:52] heaven
[8:52] and the first voice which i heard was as
[8:54] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[8:56] was saying come up hither and i will
[8:58] show thee things which must be
[9:00] hereafter.
[9:01] so we know that that john is caught up
[9:03] he's a type of them
[9:05] he's a type of the bride here brother
[9:06] branham says this is a type of the
[9:08] rapture
[9:09] and so now he hears a voice and wants
[9:11] the voice it's a trumpet
[9:13] so the trumpet calls him to the rapture
[9:15] amen
[9:16] just same thing for us that final trump
[9:18] will call us up higher
[9:20] now verse 2 and immediately i was in the
[9:22] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[9:24] heaven
[9:24] and one side on the throne and he that
[9:27] sat was to look upon like jasper and
[9:29] sardine stone and there was a rainbow
[9:31] round about the throne
[9:32] in sight like unto an imran and round
[9:35] about the throne were four and twenty
[9:37] seats and upon the seats i saw
[9:39] four and twenty elders sitting clothed
[9:42] in white raiment and they had on their
[9:44] heads crowns of gold
[9:45] and out of the throne proceeded
[9:47] lightnings and thunderings
[9:49] and voices and there were seven lamps of
[9:51] fire burning before the throne which are
[9:53] the seven spirits of god
[9:56] and before the throne there was a sea of
[9:57] glass like unto crystal
[10:00] and in the midst of the throne and round
[10:02] about the throne there were four beasts
[10:04] full of eyes before
[10:06] and behind and the first beast was like
[10:09] a lion
[10:10] and the second beast like a calf and the
[10:12] third beast had a face as a man
[10:14] and the fourth beast was like a flying
[10:16] eagle and the four beasts had each of
[10:18] them six wings about him
[10:20] and they were full of eyes within and
[10:23] they rest
[10:23] not day and night saying holy holy holy
[10:26] lord god almighty which was
[10:28] and is and is to come so we we
[10:32] see here that he looks and he sees a
[10:34] throne and a roundabout and
[10:36] in the midst of the throne are these
[10:38] four beasts
[10:39] and we're going to find these fourth
[10:41] beasts are major players as we talk
[10:43] about the church ages
[10:44] and the seven seals that these four
[10:46] beasts have a major part to play
[10:48] but you you have to understand the four
[10:50] beasts position because it matters where
[10:52] they are
[10:53] they are in the midst of and around
[10:55] about the throne
[10:56] and that's where you always find these
[10:58] four beasts you find them in the old
[11:00] testament there
[11:01] you find them whenever there's a vision
[11:03] of heaven you find them there
[11:04] you find them here the same place
[11:08] excuse me they are always connected with
[11:11] the throne of god
[11:13] that's very important verse 9 and when
[11:16] these beasts give glory and honor and
[11:17] thanks to him that son on the throne who
[11:19] liveth forever and ever
[11:21] the four and 20 elders fall down before
[11:23] him and sat on
[11:24] that that sat on the throne and worship
[11:26] him that liveth forever and ever
[11:29] casting their crowns before the throne
[11:30] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[11:33] glory and honor and power
[11:35] for thou has created all things and for
[11:37] thy pleasure
[11:38] they are and were created chapter 5
[11:42] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[11:44] sat on the throne a book
[11:45] written within and on the backside
[11:48] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[11:51] strong
[11:52] angel proclaim with a loud voice who was
[11:54] worthy to open the book
[11:56] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[11:58] man in heaven nor
[11:59] earth neither under the earth was able
[12:01] to open the book
[12:03] neither to look upon there thereon and i
[12:05] wept much
[12:06] because no man was found worthy to open
[12:09] to read the book
[12:10] neither to look thereon and one of the
[12:12] elders saith unto me weep not behold the
[12:15] lion
[12:16] of the tribe of judah the root of david
[12:18] hath prevailed
[12:19] to open the book and to loose the seven
[12:21] seals
[12:22] and i beheld and low in the midst of the
[12:24] throne and the four beasts and in the
[12:25] midst of the elder stood a lamb
[12:27] as it had been slain having seven horns
[12:30] and seven eyes which are the seven
[12:32] spirits of god
[12:33] sent forth unto all the earth and he
[12:35] came and took the book out of the right
[12:37] hand of him that sat upon the throne
[12:39] so this is this gets really interesting
[12:43] as we move into here because now we find
[12:45] in revelations chapter 5
[12:47] the scene has already been set he sees
[12:49] the beast he sees the throne
[12:51] he sees the one sitting upon the throne
[12:53] and now he sees a book in the hand of
[12:56] the one sitting on the throne
[12:57] and brother branham tells us that this
[12:59] book is the seven sealed book of
[13:01] redemption
[13:02] he tells us it's the book that that
[13:04] holds the mysteries of redemption the
[13:06] mysteries of the entire bible
[13:08] and he said that book was was redemption
[13:12] and so the the book of redemption is
[13:14] interesting
[13:15] because redemption is means to bring
[13:17] back amen or
[13:18] put back in a former condition or to buy
[13:21] back
[13:22] into a former place so it's a book of
[13:24] redemption so in this book
[13:26] are the mysteries or all the information
[13:28] containing redemption
[13:30] now god doesn't need redemption
[13:34] god hasn't fallen from anything god
[13:36] hasn't lost anything
[13:38] god doesn't need any redemption god
[13:40] doesn't need a book of redemption
[13:41] but he's holding a book of redemption
[13:44] and he's holding it waiting for the time
[13:46] that this book of redemption can go back
[13:48] to man because it was originally
[13:50] the inheritance was given to man when it
[13:53] was given to adam to
[13:54] to have dominion and rulership over all
[13:56] of the earth it was given to adam but
[13:59] adam
[13:59] lost the inheritance and so it now it
[14:02] goes
[14:03] back to the original owner and god is
[14:05] now holding this book of redemption
[14:08] it's a book of redemption because in it
[14:10] shows the claims to inheritance
[14:13] and who and who has claims and rights to
[14:17] inheritance
[14:19] hallelujah god is good so now he's
[14:22] holding it
[14:23] and he cries for someone to come and
[14:26] take the book
[14:27] now brother ram tells us there's holy
[14:29] angels there there's all kinds of
[14:31] heavenly hosts there
[14:32] you have the four beasts around the
[14:34] throne you have all of this but none of
[14:36] them can take the book of
[14:37] of redemption because they don't need
[14:40] the redemption it wasn't their
[14:41] inheritance
[14:42] it was the inheritance of man that was
[14:44] lost and so now there must be a man who
[14:46] can buy back
[14:48] what was lost so the only way you could
[14:50] have a man that's worthy to buy back is
[14:53] you have to have a man
[14:54] that comes in a different way than every
[14:56] other man's come because because
[14:58] of hybridization all man is corrupt
[15:01] and therefore no man could pay the price
[15:04] because he has corrupt blood
[15:06] so there must be a man who comes without
[15:08] corrupt blood
[15:09] a man who comes in a perfect condition
[15:12] lives a perfect life
[15:13] fulfills all the law of god then his
[15:16] blood
[15:17] his blood can pay the price of
[15:19] redemption
[15:20] and so that's what happens jesus god
[15:22] comes in the form of jesus christ
[15:24] he creates his own blood amen not
[15:27] jew not gentile but the blood of god
[15:30] comes down
[15:30] and he lives this life so fulfilling all
[15:33] the law there was
[15:34] nothing he ever did wrong no sin he ever
[15:36] committed and that makes him
[15:38] eligible now to be the sacrifice and
[15:40] that's why he's called the lamb
[15:43] and so now there's a cry out for a man
[15:46] and no man in heaven and no man on earth
[15:48] and no man
[15:49] under the earth no one who's ever lived
[15:51] nobody was currently living
[15:53] no one who would live in the future was
[15:55] ever worthy
[15:56] to take this book and john began to weep
[15:59] because john
[16:00] realizes now that this is redemption
[16:02] this is inheritance this is
[16:04] everything but then there was a
[16:08] cry that the lion of the tribe of judah
[16:10] hath
[16:11] prevailed amen and after he prevailed
[16:14] now he's coming forth now this is a this
[16:16] is a huge
[16:18] uh huge event that's taking
[16:22] place here we don't even have time to
[16:23] fully explain it because i want to get
[16:24] into the first seal but
[16:26] but you realize that he has overcome
[16:29] he says he has overcome now we realize
[16:32] that
[16:33] at calvary he paid the price of
[16:34] redemption but
[16:36] after calvary he doesn't go and take the
[16:38] book
[16:40] he goes and he begins to mediate for the
[16:43] sins of the people that he has just
[16:44] redeemed
[16:46] now he's not mediating for the old
[16:49] testament church because the old
[16:50] testament church
[16:51] now when he comes down and pays the
[16:54] price for them
[16:54] they lived a life looking forward to a
[16:56] sacrifice
[16:58] all of their animal sacrifices for
[17:00] substitution was looking forward to a
[17:02] perfect sacrifice
[17:03] so when jesus comes and pays the perfect
[17:05] sacrifice
[17:06] all those who had died under that
[17:09] covenant
[17:09] come forth amen he has just redeemed
[17:12] them
[17:14] so he's not mediating for their sins
[17:16] they're not sinning anymore they've
[17:17] already died
[17:20] all right but then he goes right to work
[17:23] mediating
[17:24] this is this is so i just wish that i
[17:28] could explain it
[17:30] i just wish that that i wasn't a human
[17:32] being right now
[17:33] and i wish you weren't human beings
[17:35] right now and i wish we could just have
[17:37] an eternal connection
[17:38] and that we could have it because this
[17:40] is so critically important that we
[17:42] realize
[17:43] now god is going through these motions
[17:45] and brother branham said these are
[17:47] actors in an act
[17:48] he's acting something out so that we can
[17:50] understand what's happening
[17:52] because in god's mind this is all
[17:53] finished from before the foundation of
[17:55] the world
[17:56] god's not acting it out amen it's acting
[17:58] out through time
[18:00] god it's already finished this is done i
[18:03] don't even understand that completely i
[18:05] just know that that's true
[18:06] so now he's acting out so showing us in
[18:08] the act what he's doing
[18:10] the lamb has been there after paying the
[18:12] price so that he can redeem man
[18:14] but he's been laying back there he's
[18:16] been mediating
[18:17] brother brennan said he's been laying as
[18:19] a high priest as melchizedek
[18:21] laying seven stripes of blood for seven
[18:23] church ages
[18:25] and what was the high priest to do on
[18:27] the day of atonement when he went in to
[18:30] sprinkle blood upon the mercy seat
[18:32] he was covering the sins of ignorance
[18:36] because you have to recognize that in
[18:38] the old testament
[18:40] the high priest would go in amen on the
[18:42] day of atonement and he would offer
[18:44] blood
[18:45] to cover the sins of ignorance because
[18:48] there was
[18:49] already there was already methods for
[18:52] atoning for your sins
[18:54] there was iniquity offerings
[18:56] transgression offerings all of these
[18:57] offerings
[18:58] if you knew you had done wrong you were
[19:00] responsible to take your offering to the
[19:02] temple
[19:04] you were supposed to be repenting all
[19:06] the time
[19:07] coming to this to the substitution of
[19:09] blood
[19:10] you're supposed to be doing that all the
[19:11] time the high priest did not go
[19:14] in for all your sins and for the sins
[19:16] you committed all year
[19:17] that's not what he went in for he went
[19:19] in to cover the things you didn't know
[19:21] about
[19:23] you got that you were responsible to
[19:26] give an offering for the things that you
[19:27] understood were wrong
[19:29] when when god would reveal it out of his
[19:31] word or you would hear it in the
[19:32] synagogue priest or you would read it
[19:34] you would realize you've done wrong and
[19:36] you were obligated to bring a sin
[19:38] offering an iniquity offering a
[19:39] transgression offering a peace offering
[19:41] you were already required under that
[19:44] covenant to do those things
[19:45] but there was there was things yet that
[19:48] they were doing they didn't even realize
[19:50] were wrong
[19:50] and god in his mercy would allow under
[19:53] the substitutionary system
[19:55] would allow a high priest to go in one
[19:57] day a year with blood
[19:59] and on that day he would mediate or he
[20:02] would
[20:02] he would he would he would intercede for
[20:04] and mediate for
[20:05] all the sins that were done into
[20:07] ignorance when they didn't know it was
[20:09] wrong
[20:12] so you can't sit in israel and just live
[20:14] any life you want
[20:15] and say know that the high priest will
[20:17] cover it one day a year that's not what
[20:19] he went in for
[20:21] he didn't go in to cover you he went in
[20:23] to cover your sins of
[20:25] ignorance so important
[20:29] so now jesus he paid the price of
[20:32] redemption
[20:33] it's a perfect blood nothing needs to be
[20:35] added to that price
[20:36] but yet he has something else to do
[20:39] before he takes the book of redemption
[20:42] he has to go back behind the throne
[20:44] and lay seven stripes or seven church
[20:46] ages because he's
[20:48] got to cover the sins of ignorance
[20:51] for the people that are in the book
[20:54] all right the the the original owner is
[20:57] holding the book
[20:59] you know the lamb knows who's in the
[21:00] book but they're seven church ages they
[21:03] don't have a full revelation of the word
[21:05] luther had part of the word but what
[21:07] about the part where luther was swearing
[21:09] and drinking and persecuting the jews
[21:12] and getting caught in politics
[21:13] either he was seed or he wasn't seed
[21:17] he was seed and he had come to the just
[21:19] shall live by faith he had come to the
[21:21] revelated word for his hour
[21:23] and he accepted it he was the
[21:24] church-aged messenger but yet there were
[21:26] sins in his life
[21:27] but because the full word hadn't been
[21:29] revealed yet jesus christ was there
[21:32] covering those sins because the full
[21:34] revelation of the word hadn't come yet
[21:39] this is so important because we're going
[21:42] to understand what 1963 was all about
[21:46] so now he's he's covering so the lamb he
[21:49] paid the price
[21:50] but he has to do the kinsmen work of
[21:53] mediation he's not
[21:54] doing it for the old testament bride
[21:57] that he's already paid the price for
[21:59] them
[22:00] he's mediating for sins they're not
[22:03] sinning anymore
[22:05] so he's doing it for the church ages
[22:09] and he has to stay back there till the
[22:12] last one comes in you ever read that in
[22:14] the seals book
[22:16] well you got to be careful brother
[22:18] branham clarifies that
[22:20] he says he must stay back there till the
[22:22] last one
[22:23] in the last age comes in and when that
[22:27] comes
[22:27] in he stops the work of kinsmen redeemer
[22:30] and he comes around and he takes the
[22:32] book he looses the seals
[22:34] he sends the seals down to church age
[22:37] messenger that's on earth at the time
[22:39] so we know the time of this transition
[22:41] and the work of melchizedek
[22:42] we can see that and why is he moving now
[22:45] because now
[22:47] now he is he is ending remember the
[22:50] mighty angel comes down
[22:51] and he lifts his hand to him that sits
[22:53] on the throne that liveth forever and
[22:54] ever
[22:55] and he says time is no more no longer or
[22:58] delayed no more
[22:59] he makes this statement and brother
[23:01] branham said it's like a roman candle
[23:03] one thing stops then another thing stops
[23:05] but the first thing brother branham says
[23:06] is time no more for denominations
[23:11] that ended for the redemption of the
[23:13] seed that
[23:14] ended the laodicean church age
[23:18] because now there's no more redemption
[23:20] under the pentecost
[23:22] you can't be sealed because the mediator
[23:24] the kinsman redeemer is not behind the
[23:26] throne anymore
[23:28] now in order to come to atonement you
[23:30] must come to the person himself the
[23:32] fullness of the word
[23:34] there's no covering for the sins of
[23:36] ignorance there must be an accepting
[23:38] that this is him this word is true and
[23:40] this message is right
[23:43] something changed something major
[23:46] changed and shifted and now you have to
[23:50] understand what 1963 was all about he
[23:53] has overcome
[23:54] what did he overcome he overcome the
[23:56] sins of ignorance
[23:57] he overcome the deception of the devil
[24:00] he overcome
[24:01] that that the devil would do to wreak
[24:04] havoc in the church ages he has overcome
[24:06] that already
[24:07] how did he overcome it he overcome it by
[24:09] his blood he overcoming his kinsmen
[24:11] redeemer and when he's overcome that
[24:13] now he's going to do something amen
[24:15] that's going to break the deception of
[24:17] the devil
[24:18] and he's going to come and bring a word
[24:19] and what was that word he brought
[24:21] the revelation of the seven seals
[24:25] hallelujah and he either came down or he
[24:29] didn't come down
[24:32] he either transitioned in the work of
[24:33] melchizedek or he didn't transition
[24:36] so now now you have to come
[24:40] that's why brother branham makes such
[24:43] unusual statements
[24:44] after the seals he makes unusual
[24:46] statements like
[24:47] he says now the bride
[24:51] is the blood by the spirit
[24:54] now in order to have the covering of the
[24:57] blood is you have to be sealed by the
[24:59] holy ghost
[25:00] because why because when he returned
[25:02] amen he came in the fullness of his word
[25:05] bringing the fullness of the holy ghost
[25:07] and that seal
[25:08] is atonement that is blood
[25:12] amen you cannot rely now there's no
[25:16] seed of god being redeemed and being
[25:20] sealed in a denominational system that's
[25:23] over that ended amen when he come and he
[25:26] took the book and he loosed the seals
[25:28] now for redemption for redemption you
[25:32] have to
[25:32] leave the denominational system and you
[25:34] have to unite to the person of christ
[25:38] there's no more time for denominational
[25:41] systems
[25:42] it ended right there and from that goes
[25:44] another one and from that goes another
[25:46] one from that goes another one
[25:47] but that ended right there time no more
[25:50] for denominational systems
[25:51] before that you could be sealed under
[25:54] the pentecostal revival
[25:55] you could even maybe live beyond that
[25:58] time i don't know
[25:59] but you were already sealed before that
[26:01] time
[26:02] and a pentecostal revival that's why
[26:04] brother branham said
[26:05] to individuals in their testimony asking
[26:07] about their fathers and all that he said
[26:08] oh he was sealed under another age
[26:11] what age the pentecostal age and when
[26:13] you're sealed you're sealed to the day
[26:15] of your redemption amen
[26:16] so the lamb must stay back there
[26:19] mediating for the sins of ignorance
[26:21] until the last one and the last age
[26:23] comes in and gets sealed
[26:24] now he steps forward and now redemption
[26:28] is time no more amen laodicea is still
[26:31] going on into tribulation
[26:34] but we've been called out of laodicea
[26:37] we've been called
[26:38] out of the pentecostal revival and
[26:39] called into the bride age
[26:41] where we connect with the person himself
[26:44] and for us
[26:44] that is redemption that is atonement
[26:47] connecting with the word the person
[26:49] of the word brings the life of the
[26:52] person of the word
[26:53] and that amen that is the blood
[26:58] that is your blood covering that's why
[27:01] nobody in the denominational system is
[27:03] covered under the blood of jesus christ
[27:06] no matter how much they say it no matter
[27:08] how many scriptures they quote
[27:09] if they don't recognize what happened in
[27:11] revelations chapter 5
[27:12] they will never understand that there is
[27:15] now no
[27:16] more redemption in those systems there's
[27:18] no more seed
[27:20] coming to a ceiling in those systems
[27:23] now the seed that is part of this scroll
[27:26] that is part of this seven sealed book
[27:28] those names that are in there
[27:29] they must catch the transition come out
[27:32] and connect to the one who took the book
[27:34] and loose the seals and who came down as
[27:36] the mighty angel
[27:37] connecting to that brings you in
[27:39] redemption and seals you
[27:42] all right we've got that we may cover
[27:44] that 10
[27:45] times 20 more times because it's super
[27:47] important that we recognize
[27:49] brother branham said this is the most
[27:50] sublime passage in all of the scriptures
[27:56] and for us we say absolutely amen
[27:59] because we recognize what happened so
[28:01] now we cannot
[28:03] accept amen living in darkness when
[28:06] light has come
[28:07] we cannot accept living outside the
[28:10] blood when the blood of the person
[28:12] himself with the blood has come
[28:13] amen now there's something that changes
[28:16] so you have to catch the changes or else
[28:18] you're going to be in trouble
[28:19] because when jesus came the first time
[28:22] they had lived under a system of
[28:24] substitutionary sacrifice
[28:26] where you could take a turtle dove or a
[28:28] goat or a sheep or an
[28:30] oxen you could take that and that thing
[28:32] would die in your stead
[28:34] and its blood would cover your sins
[28:37] that was perfectly acceptable that was
[28:39] the word under that
[28:41] under that uh condition or
[28:44] under that age the seed of god
[28:48] were being caught into redemption
[28:52] under that but when jesus christ came
[28:56] now all those substitutes are pointing
[28:58] to a true sacrifice
[29:00] the true sacrifice now comes and now you
[29:03] have this
[29:04] lap over period while he's there but
[29:06] just as soon as he dies
[29:08] he brother branham said it this way when
[29:10] they took
[29:11] the lamb and with wicked hands they
[29:13] crucified the lamb
[29:15] now they put the lamb in full effect
[29:18] they put that word in full of fact and
[29:21] from that point on
[29:22] you could slay thousands of lambs
[29:25] thousands of
[29:26] oxen it would do you no good anymore
[29:30] absolutely no benefit to you anymore
[29:33] whatsoever
[29:34] because now everything that they were
[29:37] pointing to had come
[29:38] he lived the perfect life that he's held
[29:40] up amen
[29:42] showing that he was spotless amen
[29:43] without flaw and then he was taken by
[29:46] the high priest and he was sacrificed
[29:48] and killed
[29:48] now he became the absolute substitute
[29:51] for you
[29:52] and now you have to come and recognize
[29:55] that
[29:56] to be sealed in redemption
[29:59] now the seed of god recognized that but
[30:02] the ones who are not elect not seed
[30:04] they keep slaying oxen they keep slaying
[30:06] sheep they keep there's still blood
[30:08] flowing all the time until god
[30:10] demolishes that temple amen
[30:12] so so now you if you don't catch the
[30:15] transition
[30:16] but don't worry the elective god always
[30:18] catch the transition
[30:20] because the seed have to come to the
[30:21] place where they're redeemed
[30:24] so now we go through 2 000 years
[30:27] and we understand that he's giving seven
[30:29] stripes for seven ages
[30:31] now you have to recognize that
[30:35] he's back there now he's like an actor
[30:37] acting out a play right
[30:39] because god is an eternal spirit he
[30:41] doesn't need a sit seat to sit on
[30:43] he doesn't need a dwelling place you see
[30:46] you understand
[30:47] that he's showing us in typology showing
[30:50] us in a drama what's taking place
[30:51] so that we with our finite minds can
[30:54] somewhat comprehend what he's doing
[30:57] and so he's showing us that he's back
[30:59] there amen laying seven
[31:01] stripes of blood for seven church ages
[31:03] now you have to recognize
[31:05] that the blood stripe for your age was
[31:08] the only place of atonement for your age
[31:11] you couldn't go to the old stripe that
[31:13] was laid back in luther's day
[31:15] because luther was under a stripe
[31:17] luther's age was
[31:18] under a stripe of blood from melchizedek
[31:22] laying down a stripe of his own blood
[31:25] covering the sins of
[31:26] ignorance because the full word wasn't
[31:28] revealed but you couldn't stay in the
[31:31] previous age
[31:32] you had to come under luther's message
[31:35] to be under this stripe because the
[31:38] stripe that had laid down yesterday
[31:39] would not cover you today
[31:43] so then when wesley come on preaching a
[31:44] revival now
[31:46] because wesley's bringing out further
[31:48] light more
[31:49] truth but he doesn't have it all yet the
[31:51] the high priest is back there the lamb
[31:54] laying down a striped bud to cover all
[31:56] the things that he doesn't understand
[32:00] but luther's age you cannot you have to
[32:02] catch the transition
[32:04] you're no longer able to be sealed under
[32:06] under under luther's message and reject
[32:09] wesley's message in the day that the
[32:11] blood was there for wesley's message
[32:14] he was covering for the ignorance of the
[32:16] age but once light has come you cannot
[32:18] stay in darkness
[32:20] you have to come to the light if you
[32:22] walk in the light as he is
[32:24] in the light then you have fellowship
[32:27] with one another and the blood of jesus
[32:28] christ will atone for you
[32:30] but you have to be in the light as he's
[32:32] in the light
[32:34] so now under the pentecostal revival in
[32:36] the late ocean church age he's laying
[32:38] another stripe down
[32:40] because there's seed coming through
[32:41] there the elect of god are catching the
[32:43] transition
[32:44] they're catching the light as the
[32:45] light's measured out they come to the
[32:47] light and they're living in that
[32:48] and they're being sealed in that to a
[32:50] point where that last
[32:52] elect seed in that last age
[32:56] is sealed in under the work of boaz
[33:02] under the kinsman redeemer
[33:05] then after that one he comes forth
[33:08] he takes the book he looses the seals
[33:12] the mighty angel comes down with an open
[33:14] book now
[33:16] everything about that system has changed
[33:20] you can't rely on that system it worked
[33:21] for nearly two thousand years it doesn't
[33:23] work anymore
[33:24] something changed now for redemption
[33:28] you can't rely on boaz working it out at
[33:31] the gate
[33:32] now for redemption you have to unite the
[33:34] boaz himself
[33:37] before before boaz was working it out in
[33:40] the gate
[33:41] amen at the throne at the place of
[33:43] judgment he's working it out because the
[33:45] city gate was always the place of
[33:47] judgment where the elders were
[33:48] so here the lamb is back there laying
[33:50] seven stripes where
[33:51] at the throne at the gate at the
[33:53] judgment bar amen
[33:55] where all the elders are the 24 elders
[33:57] and the four beasts they're all right
[33:58] there
[33:59] he's doing the work of boaz in the city
[34:01] gate amen at the place of judgment
[34:03] he's making he's making amends for ruth
[34:06] but there comes a time that he leaves
[34:08] that and now you can't just say
[34:10] boaz is doing it boaz is doing it you
[34:13] have to connect to boaz now
[34:16] and that's the place of redemption
[34:18] that's the place of atonement that's the
[34:19] blood
[34:21] hallelujah god is so good to us friends
[34:27] this is this is the most sublime passage
[34:31] in all of scripture hallelujah
[34:36] all right let's keep reading i don't
[34:39] even know where i stopped
[34:42] verse 8 i think and he had taken the
[34:45] book and the four beasts and the four
[34:47] and twenty elders
[34:48] fell down before the lamb having every
[34:49] one of them harps and golden biles
[34:51] full of odors which are the prayers of
[34:53] the saints and they sung a new song
[34:55] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[34:57] and to open the seals thereof
[34:59] for thou was slain and has redeemed us
[35:01] to god by thy blood out of every kindred
[35:03] and tongue and people and nation and has
[35:06] made us unto our god kings and priests
[35:08] and we shall reign on
[35:09] on the earth and i beheld and heard the
[35:12] voice of many angels round about the
[35:14] throne
[35:14] and the beast and the elders and the
[35:16] number of them was ten thousand times
[35:18] ten thousand in thousands of thousands
[35:21] saying with a loud voice worthy is the
[35:22] lamb that was slain to receive
[35:24] power and riches and wisdom and strength
[35:26] and honor
[35:27] and glory and blessing and every
[35:29] creature which is in heaven and on the
[35:31] earth and under the earth and such as
[35:33] are in the sea
[35:34] and all that are in them heard i saying
[35:36] blessing and honor
[35:37] and glory and power be unto him that
[35:40] sitteth upon the throne
[35:41] and unto the lamb forever and ever and
[35:44] the four beasts said
[35:45] amen and the four and twenty elders fell
[35:47] down and worshipped him
[35:49] that liveth forever and ever
[35:52] praise the lord the most sublime passage
[35:55] in all the scriptures
[35:57] now when when this takes place
[36:00] brother branham now after the seals
[36:02] comes and preaches a message called
[36:04] indictment
[36:05] an indictment he talks about the the
[36:08] method of when jesus christ came the
[36:10] word
[36:11] in in full measure when he came in the
[36:13] fullness of flesh
[36:14] they took with wicked hands they took
[36:16] and they crucified the lord of glory
[36:19] and when they did they took that word
[36:20] and put it into full effect
[36:22] thereby abolishing the previous word
[36:25] what worked before won't work now
[36:27] because they took it and crucified it
[36:29] proving that it was the lamb if they
[36:32] didn't crucify it it wouldn't have been
[36:34] the lamb
[36:34] but by crucifying it they proved that it
[36:36] is the lamb
[36:38] hallelujah so in the indictment brother
[36:41] branham says
[36:42] now i indict this generation for the
[36:45] second crucifixion of jesus christ
[36:48] because when he came now in the fullness
[36:50] of his word that's what the mighty angel
[36:52] was coming down for
[36:53] when he came in the fullness of his word
[36:55] and brother branham taught the seven
[36:57] seals
[36:57] and they rejected it the nominations
[36:59] rejected it he says now
[37:01] you have put the word in full effect
[37:05] now the old system is dead nothing's
[37:08] coming to life in the old system
[37:10] nobody's getting sealed in the old
[37:11] system there's no redemption in the old
[37:13] system
[37:14] now it's all in the word that you have
[37:16] crucified
[37:17] and by crucifying it they proved it was
[37:19] the lamb
[37:21] they proved it was the word because they
[37:23] crucified it
[37:24] because they rejected it putting it by
[37:26] rejecting it they put it in position
[37:29] by rejecting jesus christ when he came
[37:31] on earth they put it in position
[37:33] by rejecting christ when he came in the
[37:35] fullness of the word they put it in
[37:37] position
[37:38] and now the only place to have
[37:39] redemption is to connect to that person
[37:43] receive the word for your age receive
[37:46] the revelation of jesus christ in our
[37:48] day
[37:49] that brings us redemption
[37:52] hallelujah
[37:57] brother brahma says in the breach
[37:59] between the church age and the seals
[38:02] now when we go breaking these seals
[38:03] you're going to see it goes plumb back
[38:05] in the scripture all the way back
[38:07] for each one of these seals the whole
[38:08] thing together the whole mystery lays
[38:10] right here
[38:11] in these seals every mystery of the
[38:13] bible lays in these seals and the seals
[38:15] cannot be broken until that time
[38:18] boy i tell you what that is amazing if
[38:21] you if you just take
[38:22] face value on the seals and don't dig
[38:24] into it you think he's talking about
[38:26] just a span of time that covers the
[38:28] church ages
[38:29] but he says it goes all the way back and
[38:32] every mystery of the bible
[38:34] lays in these seals why it's a book of
[38:36] redemption
[38:37] so it's got to cover everything that was
[38:39] redeemed from genesis to revelations
[38:43] hallelujah souls that are in prison now
[38:46] but one day he rose from there came
[38:48] forth
[38:48] where was a book at it was still in the
[38:50] abstract owner god almighty
[38:52] and john looked around and he wept
[38:54] because there was no man even worthy to
[38:56] look on the book and especially
[38:58] open the seals to reveal what the hidden
[39:00] mystery was
[39:01] the mysteries was in the seven seals
[39:03] when these seven seals was open that
[39:05] opened up the entire
[39:07] bible oh hallelujah i can't even tell
[39:11] you what that fully means yet but i know
[39:12] it's true
[39:14] that's why i'm saying god grant me a
[39:15] greater revelation what is it you
[39:17] brought lord open my eyes to see it
[39:19] there's more to this than i thought
[39:23] the seven seals it was sealed with seven
[39:25] mysteries and then these seven seals
[39:27] held the entire
[39:28] mystery of it so in order for it to
[39:30] follow the pattern that brother benham
[39:31] laid down
[39:32] it has to be in simplicity we got that
[39:35] this can't be anything mega complicated
[39:38] it's got to be simple
[39:39] if it's not simple it's not right so the
[39:42] the mysteries there the entire bible
[39:44] there's more mysteries in the revelation
[39:46] than what i always understood it was
[39:48] more there
[39:48] but it's got to be in simplicity if it's
[39:51] not in simplicity then it's not
[39:55] so we see that the the seals have been
[39:57] opened
[39:58] in the in the revelation of jesus christ
[40:00] out of the church age book
[40:01] says now remember this christ in the
[40:03] true church is a continuation of the
[40:05] book of acts
[40:06] but the book of revelation shows how
[40:08] that the antichrist spirit would come
[40:10] into the church
[40:11] and defile it making it lukewarm
[40:14] formal and powerless now what does that
[40:16] the book of revelation
[40:19] the book of revelation shows
[40:22] what the antichrist spirit's going to do
[40:25] and what he did to the church
[40:27] next it exposes what is it the book of
[40:31] revelation
[40:32] the book of revelation exposes satan
[40:34] revealing his works
[40:36] attempted destruction of god's people
[40:38] and the desecration of god's word
[40:40] stop right there that's his works period
[40:44] put a dot at the end of it that's all
[40:45] he's doing
[40:47] he's not doing anything else this is
[40:49] what he's doing
[40:50] and what reveals it the book of
[40:51] revelation
[40:53] reveals satan in his words attempted
[40:55] destruction of god's people
[40:57] and the desecrating of god's word
[41:01] how far back does that go in the bible
[41:04] how long has he been trying to destroy
[41:07] god's
[41:07] people and discredit god's word
[41:11] amen so the whole bible was locked up in
[41:14] this book of revelation
[41:15] it shows what the devil's been doing and
[41:18] how he's been doing it
[41:19] and how he intends to do it and when did
[41:21] he start discrediting the word
[41:23] all the way back in genesis and i i'll
[41:26] go back further than that
[41:28] when did he start discrediting god's
[41:30] word he started in heaven and the war
[41:32] that broke out in heaven
[41:34] that's where he started discrediting his
[41:35] word then that battle came down to
[41:37] heaven and he's been doing it ever since
[41:39] that's why the mystery of the entire
[41:41] bible was locked up in the book of
[41:42] revelation locked up in these seals
[41:45] because the whole bible's telling one
[41:47] story
[41:48] one story amen is is being told in the
[41:51] bible don't break it out
[41:52] don't separate it don't make it old
[41:54] testament new testament don't make it
[41:55] jews and gentiles
[41:56] make it one story and then you're going
[41:58] to find out what this is all about
[42:02] so he exposes satan revealing his works
[42:04] attempted destruction of god's people in
[42:05] the discrediting of god's word
[42:07] now stop oh no let's read the next line
[42:09] right down to the time he's cast into
[42:11] the lake of fire
[42:13] so how long is he going to be doing it
[42:14] until he's cast into the lake of fire
[42:16] has he been cast into the lake of fire
[42:18] yet no so that means he's doing this and
[42:20] he's attempting to do it to you
[42:22] every day and what exposes him the book
[42:25] of revelation
[42:28] hallelujah he is still attempting the
[42:30] destruction of god's people and the
[42:32] discrediting of god's word
[42:33] don't think that oh i saw it in the
[42:35] church ages if he did in the church ages
[42:37] he's trying to do it to you right now
[42:39] whatever he did to eve he's trying to do
[42:41] to you whatever he did to the jews he's
[42:43] trying to do to you
[42:44] whatever he did to the first church age
[42:46] the second church age the third church
[42:47] age he's trying to do it to you
[42:49] because he never changes his ways
[42:53] his tactics don't change amen so don't
[42:56] don't put this
[42:57] off somewhere else we take all of this
[42:59] right home
[43:01] every day satan is trying to destroy you
[43:03] and discredit god's word
[43:09] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[43:11] knows that if the people get the true
[43:13] revelation of the true church and what
[43:15] she
[43:15] is and what she stands for that she can
[43:18] do the greater works
[43:20] she will be an invincible army
[43:23] if they get a true revelation of the two
[43:25] spirits within the framework of the
[43:27] christian church
[43:28] and by god's spirit discern and
[43:30] withstand the antichrist spirit
[43:32] satan will be powerless before her
[43:35] amen we gotta we gotta slow down
[43:38] we've heard these so many times we go
[43:40] too fast
[43:43] if they get a true revelation of the two
[43:45] spirits
[43:46] within the framework of the christian
[43:48] church and by god's spirit
[43:50] discern and withstand the antichrist
[43:52] spirit
[43:53] satan will be powerless before her
[43:57] hallelujah how many wants satan to be
[44:00] powerless
[44:02] then we have to have a revelation of two
[44:04] spirits
[44:06] and we have to have the revelation that
[44:08] exposes
[44:09] two spirits and what exposes two spirits
[44:12] the revelation the book of revelation
[44:16] the seven seal book exposes the two
[44:20] vines
[44:23] if they can by god's spirit discern and
[44:27] withstand the antichrist spirit satan
[44:28] will be powerless before her
[44:30] he will be as definitely thwarted today
[44:32] as when christ withstood his every
[44:33] effort to gain
[44:34] power over him in the desert yes satan
[44:37] hates revelation
[44:38] but we love it with true revelation in
[44:41] our lives the gates of hell cannot
[44:43] prevail against us
[44:44] but we will prevail over them
[44:47] what is a revelation a proper
[44:50] understanding
[44:53] amen a revelation when a revelation
[44:55] comes to you
[44:57] revelation comes by faith faith cometh
[44:59] by hearing hearing by the word of god
[45:01] but you can hear the word of god and
[45:02] hear the word of god and hear the word
[45:04] of god
[45:04] and if god doesn't give you faith to
[45:06] believe it then you don't receive a
[45:08] revelation
[45:09] you can read the bible read the bible
[45:10] read the bible but it takes god to
[45:12] unlock it
[45:13] but when he unlocks it what is
[45:14] revelation a proper
[45:16] understanding right
[45:19] posit you can position the word you
[45:22] understand what it means
[45:23] it's placed correctly and and that that
[45:25] when god brings revelation
[45:27] he brings a proper understanding so we
[45:30] make revelation so mystical
[45:33] so so far away that i've got to have
[45:36] revelation what revelations i don't know
[45:40] i haven't got one yet
[45:42] how do you know when you'll get it what
[45:44] is it what's it going to be what's it
[45:45] going to look like
[45:46] it's always revelation on the word it's
[45:48] a proper understanding a positioning of
[45:49] the word
[45:50] knowing what it means and what its
[45:51] position and what it is for you that's
[45:53] revelation
[45:55] don't make it mystical and far away just
[45:58] receive the word accept the message
[46:00] bring it into your heart and let god
[46:01] quicken it to you and understand
[46:03] what god's trying to get the church to
[46:04] see in this day
[46:09] so we know that there's two vines
[46:12] satan and christ this started the second
[46:16] vine started in heaven
[46:18] but this the second vine is going to
[46:20] have an annihilation one day it's going
[46:21] to end
[46:22] and we read about it through the book
[46:25] all right and the message seed is not
[46:27] there with the shock notice see how
[46:28] close it looks
[46:29] matthew said saint matthew 24 24 said
[46:32] the two spirits in the last days
[46:34] the church spirit of the church people
[46:35] and the bride spirit of the bride people
[46:37] would be so close together until it
[46:39] would deceive the very elect if it was
[46:41] possible
[46:42] that's how close now if you read that
[46:46] and you think denominations and the
[46:48] bride
[46:49] you have missed everything he's trying
[46:51] to teach you
[46:53] it's the church spirit of the church
[46:54] people
[46:57] and the bride spirit of the bride people
[47:01] you could have a church spirit sitting
[47:03] in here to this morning
[47:05] where you're content coming to church
[47:07] saying i believe the message
[47:08] going home but that's about all the
[47:10] effect it has on you is sunday
[47:12] sunday sunday come to church go to
[47:13] church pay tithe that's all right
[47:15] but god has not called us to a church
[47:17] life he's called us to a spirit life
[47:19] he's not called us to attend church and
[47:21] say i go to church and say i believe the
[47:22] message
[47:23] he's calling us to live the token to put
[47:26] the life of christ
[47:27] on display to receive the person himself
[47:30] and let it change our every moment or
[47:31] every day
[47:33] not a sunday wednesday not uncommon
[47:35] morality
[47:36] amen not a not a book of creeds to line
[47:39] up to and i believe the message and
[47:40] therefore
[47:41] i don't wear i don't cut my hair that's
[47:43] not what he's talking about
[47:45] that could be a church life you could
[47:49] you could you could join many many
[47:51] churches you could go to pilgrim
[47:52] holiness churches and you could go to
[47:54] other wesleyan holiness churches where
[47:56] you don't cut your hair and wear a long
[47:57] dress and pay your tithe
[47:59] and try to keep the word and raise your
[48:00] children and subjection
[48:02] you could go to another church and have
[48:03] all that but it's not church spirit
[48:06] it's not church life it's a bride spirit
[48:09] for a bride life
[48:10] for the bride people it is the it is the
[48:13] literal life of jesus christ
[48:15] in your flesh dominating your whole life
[48:18] taking over every moment
[48:20] amen there's not a moment that you're
[48:22] not in the bride spirit
[48:24] that doesn't mean you don't fall or fail
[48:26] but it's not church it's not about
[48:28] church not about church people
[48:29] i've heard so much foolishness going on
[48:32] i get caught up in it myself sometimes
[48:34] thinking wrong thinking in the past
[48:36] but god brings us out and he shows you
[48:38] what he's trying to show you
[48:39] it is supposed to be a mini-membered
[48:41] body the body of jesus christ
[48:43] on earth displaying the full measure of
[48:46] the word
[48:48] i've heard people say before when we go
[48:50] on vacation we let our kids wear this
[48:52] and my wife will wear that because
[48:53] there's no believers around
[48:56] that's a church spirit for a church life
[49:00] amen why do you only dress right for the
[49:02] believers the believers
[49:04] they already know the truth amen they
[49:06] don't need you to display the word they
[49:07] already know the word
[49:09] it's supposed to be the life of jesus
[49:11] christ not just when you're in church or
[49:13] around the believers or in your hometown
[49:15] but you can be on vacation in the most
[49:17] distant remote region in the whole world
[49:19] and you still live the life of jesus
[49:21] christ that's what he's calling us to
[49:23] that's the bride spirit
[49:26] not you can wear pants when we go do
[49:27] this activity because we're not around
[49:29] believers
[49:30] who cares if we're around believers
[49:32] jesus christ is a believer and he's
[49:34] supposed to be everywhere i go
[49:37] amen see the deception deception comes
[49:41] in and reasoning and logic
[49:43] and begins to move us away these two
[49:45] spirits are so close
[49:47] and brother brother bam said they're
[49:48] wound together
[49:53] don't start thinking denominations in
[49:55] the bride
[49:56] don't start thinking bcf in the local
[49:58] pentecostal church you're going to miss
[50:00] it a million miles
[50:02] you've got to say god i don't want a
[50:03] church spirit in me
[50:07] i don't want a church spirit here i want
[50:09] the bride spirit
[50:11] i want the spirit of jesus christ i'm
[50:13] going to flesh out the word
[50:14] i want to live such a life if i was the
[50:16] last human being on the face of this
[50:18] earth
[50:18] that i've got the life of jesus christ i
[50:20] would live what jesus wrote in his word
[50:22] when nobody's looking when
[50:26] nobody's watching amen when i'm at home
[50:28] alone or if it's just me and my family
[50:30] or we're on vacation
[50:32] it matters not where i am or where you
[50:34] find me you're going to find me living
[50:35] the life of jesus christ
[50:37] anything besides that is a church life a
[50:40] church walk
[50:41] and it is a false vine
[50:45] hallelujah
[50:48] praise god that's how close you receive
[50:53] the very
[50:54] elect if it was possible
[50:57] you're not going to deceive the very
[50:59] elect in this day with catholic doctrine
[51:02] with pentecostal doctrine that won't
[51:04] deceive the elect
[51:06] it's got to be a little closer than that
[51:08] to deceive the elect
[51:11] so we find out that there's a battle
[51:13] plan because it started as war in heaven
[51:16] and the wars come down to earth and this
[51:18] whole book
[51:19] is a war it is
[51:22] spiritual warfare being fleshed out and
[51:24] manifest on the earth
[51:25] and the whole book talks about war and
[51:28] so
[51:29] the the book of revelation exposes
[51:32] what the devil's been doing all along
[51:37] but christ is doing something too
[51:41] and that's what we want to pay attention
[51:42] to
[51:45] fourth seal notice what is this all
[51:48] coming to we've just got about 12 14
[51:51] minutes here i guess
[51:52] look what this is all coming to now he's
[51:55] he's come to the fourth seal he's
[51:56] talking about the last horse rider
[51:58] the one that's going to ride through the
[52:00] tribulation period
[52:01] and he says what is all this coming to
[52:03] he's been through the four horse riders
[52:05] now he's to the to the the one who's
[52:07] riding on the last horse the last
[52:08] last stage going to be incarnate and the
[52:10] beast and the in the tribulation period
[52:13] what's it coming to what is it it's
[52:15] going right back the way it did
[52:17] it started in heaven it's coming to the
[52:19] end time battle
[52:21] so whatever started in heaven it started
[52:24] there it's coming
[52:25] right back to it michael and lucifer
[52:27] again
[52:29] it's coming right back to where it
[52:31] started in heaven that's what all of
[52:32] this is about
[52:33] that's what all of this is leading to
[52:35] this is where we're all coming to
[52:37] right back to that battle in heaven
[52:40] hallelujah the first thing in heaven was
[52:44] a battle lucifer was kicked out and come
[52:46] to the earth
[52:46] then he polluted eden then he's been
[52:48] polluting ever since
[52:50] and now from the battle in heaven it's
[52:52] coming to the battle on earth
[52:53] and it's to be finished on earth at the
[52:56] time
[52:57] in the battle of called armageddon now
[52:59] anyone knows that the battle started in
[53:01] heaven
[53:02] and so they kicked him out michael and
[53:05] his angels overthrew them just run out
[53:07] and when they did dropped right down in
[53:09] eden and there started the battle down
[53:11] here
[53:12] god had his children all fortified up by
[53:14] his word and eve stuck her neck out
[53:17] and i believe you're right maybe and
[53:18] there it went and it's been
[53:20] ever since
[53:23] so now think about this the battle
[53:26] started in heaven
[53:27] lucifer rebelled against god amen
[53:30] so whatever tactics that he's using down
[53:33] here
[53:33] are the same tactics he's used up there
[53:36] just trying to destroy
[53:37] god's people and discredit god's word he
[53:40] tried it there
[53:41] amen he's trying it here he's not
[53:43] changing
[53:44] god's not changing he's not changing
[53:47] it's just repeating over
[53:48] and over and over again that's why when
[53:51] you find the scripture you find the
[53:52] pattern you found the whole thing
[53:53] the pattern always works so he comes
[53:56] down
[53:57] all right and so now they come down and
[53:59] the battle
[54:00] drops down to earth and god knows that
[54:02] the battle is coming to earth
[54:03] he knows lucifer has been kicked out he
[54:05] knows he's coming down
[54:06] and he's got children now in the garden
[54:08] of eden so god doesn't leave the
[54:10] children to their own devices
[54:11] what he does is he builds a fortress for
[54:13] them and he builds a fortress so thick
[54:15] and so high
[54:16] that it's impenetrable and the devil can
[54:18] never get to him lucifer can never
[54:20] deceive him
[54:21] what happened in heaven can never happen
[54:22] again as long as they stay
[54:25] in the fortress god doesn't leave his
[54:28] people defenseless
[54:29] he didn't leave he didn't leave adam and
[54:31] eve there all alone in the garden with
[54:33] with no defense no protection and
[54:36] knowing that lucifer is out
[54:38] roaming around trying to deceive amen
[54:40] dude god didn't think that oh
[54:42] lucifer's kicked out we're done with him
[54:44] now we'll never see him again
[54:46] god knew what was going to happen so god
[54:49] built a fortress he built a tank
[54:51] all right and he put adam and even the
[54:53] tank and they're in the tank
[54:54] and then nothing can beat them nothing
[54:56] could deceive them amen nothing could
[54:58] ever hurt them
[54:59] when they're in the tank but the devil
[55:02] didn't try to take on the tank
[55:06] the devil can't defeat god's armament
[55:08] amen
[55:09] he can't destroy god's weapon he can
[55:12] never come against it so what's he
[55:14] always tried to get the people to do
[55:15] he tried to get them to lose confidence
[55:17] in the weapon
[55:20] and god fortified his children behind
[55:22] the word of god
[55:23] and so the devil doesn't try to take the
[55:25] word on head on what he tries to do
[55:27] is he tries to get eve to lay her weapon
[55:30] down
[55:31] and come out from behind the wall
[55:35] has this tactic ever changed it's never
[55:37] changed
[55:38] brother branham said the devil he's
[55:40] trying he said he's
[55:41] trying to get you to lose confidence in
[55:43] your weapon
[55:45] what is your weapon the sword of the
[55:46] spirit which is the word of god
[55:48] it's the only weapon you've got you
[55:49] don't have another one and he's trying
[55:51] to get you to lose confidence in the
[55:53] weapon
[55:54] because the devil can never defeat the
[55:57] word
[55:59] he can't he's no match he never will he
[56:01] never has he never can defeat the word
[56:04] so the devil tries to get you laid down
[56:06] the word now this is amazing
[56:09] you yourself are no match for the devil
[56:14] you will never ever ever defeat the
[56:17] devil
[56:19] never i don't care how much you jump up
[56:21] and down and yell and stomp and snort
[56:23] and spit and
[56:24] all you're doing is acting out in the
[56:25] flesh and doesn't do a thing to the
[56:27] devil
[56:28] you can yell and scream at him you can
[56:30] call him a liar all you want but it's
[56:32] not going to move him
[56:33] because you yourself can never defeat
[56:35] the devil
[56:37] so god has given you a sword and that
[56:40] sword
[56:40] is the sword of the spirit which is the
[56:42] word of god and the devil can never
[56:44] defeat the sword
[56:46] so the devil knows he can never defeat
[56:48] the sword but he can defeat you
[56:50] any time any place anywhere
[56:54] but brother ben said the word of god
[56:56] will defeat lucifer that will feed the
[56:57] devil any place any time anywhere
[57:00] under any conditions so the devil will
[57:04] never come
[57:05] head to head with the sword he wants you
[57:08] to lay down the sword
[57:11] and lose confidence in it or leave it in
[57:13] the sheath or
[57:14] feel like you're not worthy
[57:17] to take the sword whatever how whatever
[57:21] tactic he can use to keep you from
[57:24] taking the sword
[57:25] because he can never defeat the sword
[57:29] but you can never defeat him
[57:34] see this isn't hard it's easy
[57:38] reasoning science doctors in medicine
[57:43] 401ks credit cards none of that will
[57:47] ever defeat the devil
[57:50] ever but the word
[57:55] so he tries to get you to put confidence
[57:57] in something other than the word
[58:01] and reason he tries to get you to lean
[58:03] on science and not on the word
[58:06] lean on medicine and not on the word
[58:09] lean on your job and not on the word
[58:12] lean on retirement and not on the word
[58:15] and if he can get you to do that he's
[58:17] moved you away from the word
[58:19] and he is just about to obliterate you
[58:22] because you're no match without the
[58:24] sword
[58:26] so so that's where he started in the
[58:28] garden of eden and
[58:29] and god had his children all fortified
[58:32] up but eve stuck her neck out
[58:34] she said i believe you're right maybe
[58:37] and there it went and it's been ever
[58:39] since
[58:42] so in the battle plan the first thing
[58:46] lucifer does is bring a white horse
[58:48] let's read in revelations chapter 6
[58:50] together
[58:55] i can see now we're not going to get
[58:57] through a fraction of our
[59:00] stuff revelations chapter 6 verse 1
[59:05] and i saw when the lamb opened one of
[59:06] the seals and i heard as it were the
[59:08] noise of thunder and one of the four
[59:10] beasts saying come and see
[59:12] and i saw on behold a white horse and he
[59:14] that sat on him had a bow
[59:16] and a crown was given unto him and he
[59:18] went forth conquering
[59:19] and to conquer so this is the first seal
[59:22] in symbol form
[59:23] that john saul and john recorded for us
[59:26] and we see the symbology here and he
[59:29] went forth on a white horse
[59:31] and and he had a bow and a crown was
[59:34] given unto him
[59:35] and he went forth conquering and to
[59:37] conquer him so we find out he has a bow
[59:39] but no arrows brother brennan brings
[59:42] that out in the seals
[59:44] and he receives a crown so he doesn't
[59:46] come with a crown but he receives a
[59:48] crown
[59:49] and his whole purpose is to conquer
[59:53] all right now
[59:57] we'll just let the cat out of the bag
[59:59] and then just pick up the pieces later
[1:00:02] how is he going to conquer when he has
[1:00:05] no dominion or authority he has no crown
[1:00:09] he has a bow but no arrows so
[1:00:13] how is he going to conquer he's coming
[1:00:16] to conquer
[1:00:17] but if you send me out to conquer and
[1:00:19] you don't give me a weapon and you give
[1:00:20] me no authority how in the world i'm
[1:00:22] going to conquer
[1:00:23] so the only way this white horse can
[1:00:25] conquer is through deception
[1:00:28] because he has no weapon that can hurt
[1:00:30] you he has no authority over you he
[1:00:33] doesn't have a crown
[1:00:34] he has a bow but no arrows he can't hurt
[1:00:37] you
[1:00:38] he has no authority over you there's
[1:00:40] nothing he can do to you
[1:00:41] so he has to come but his whole purpose
[1:00:43] is to conquer
[1:00:44] so if he's going to conquer the only way
[1:00:46] he can conquer is through deception
[1:00:54] he said who is that white horse rider
[1:00:57] you're not blind you see who it is it's
[1:00:58] that antichrist
[1:01:00] and that deceitful spirit that's gone
[1:01:02] now and crept in
[1:01:06] praise the lord now let's breathe in the
[1:01:10] first seal the rider has no arrows for
[1:01:12] his bow did you notice
[1:01:13] he had a bow but there's nothing said
[1:01:15] about having any arrows so he must be a
[1:01:17] bluffer
[1:01:19] notice he look he starts out to conquer
[1:01:21] notice he has no crown
[1:01:23] the white horse rider i'm speaking of
[1:01:24] here a bow and a crown was given him
[1:01:26] afterwards see
[1:01:27] he had no crown to start with but a
[1:01:29] crown was given to him
[1:01:33] look at this one a white horse rider
[1:01:36] went out
[1:01:36] who is he he's mighty in his conquering
[1:01:39] power
[1:01:40] look at this he's mighty in his
[1:01:43] conquering power
[1:01:44] but he has a bow with no arrows and no
[1:01:46] crown
[1:01:48] but he's mighty in his conquering power
[1:01:51] but his power doesn't come from
[1:01:52] authority
[1:01:53] and his power does not come from a
[1:01:55] weapon his power comes from deception
[1:01:59] that's why he's on a white horse because
[1:02:00] in revelations 19 you see christ coming
[1:02:03] back
[1:02:03] riding on a white horse that's why this
[1:02:05] false vine wants to be so
[1:02:07] close that you can hardly tell the
[1:02:09] difference
[1:02:12] he's mighty in conquering power he wants
[1:02:14] you want me to tell you who he is he's
[1:02:15] the antichrist that's exactly what he is
[1:02:17] now because you see
[1:02:19] if if jesus said that the two would be
[1:02:20] so close together to deceive the very
[1:02:22] elected the bride if it was possible
[1:02:24] antichrist is the antichrist spirit
[1:02:28] so i want to i want to read
[1:02:33] let's read out of 2 thessalonians
[1:02:35] chapter 2 together
[1:02:36] everybody turn in your bibles
[1:02:49] second thessalonians chapter 2
[1:02:53] verse 3
[1:03:00] let no man deceive you by any means for
[1:03:02] that day shall not come except there
[1:03:04] come a falling away first and the man of
[1:03:06] sin be revealed
[1:03:07] the son of perdition who opposeth and
[1:03:10] exalteth himself above all that is
[1:03:11] called god or that is worship
[1:03:13] so that he as god sitteth in the temple
[1:03:15] of god showing himself that he is gone
[1:03:18] so where is the devil trying to get to
[1:03:21] not a bar room not a ball field
[1:03:24] that's not where he's trying to get he's
[1:03:26] trying to get to the temple of god and
[1:03:27] sit on the throne of god and declare
[1:03:28] that he is god
[1:03:30] he wants to be worshiped by like god so
[1:03:33] so he'll take any kind of false worship
[1:03:34] he can take
[1:03:37] verse five remember ye not that when i
[1:03:39] was yet with you i told you these things
[1:03:41] and now you know
[1:03:42] what withholded that he might be
[1:03:44] revealed in his time
[1:03:46] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:03:48] work only who who now letteth will let
[1:03:50] until he be taken out of the way
[1:03:51] so you can find that this mystery was
[1:03:53] already working in the first church age
[1:03:56] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[1:03:58] whom the lord shall
[1:03:59] consume with the brightness
[1:04:02] uh no consumed with the spirit of his
[1:04:04] mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:04:06] brightness of his coming
[1:04:07] even him whose coming is after the
[1:04:09] working of satan with all wonders and
[1:04:10] signs and lying wonders
[1:04:12] with all deceivableness of
[1:04:13] unrighteousness and them that perish
[1:04:15] because they receive not the love of the
[1:04:17] truth
[1:04:17] that they might be saved what did they
[1:04:19] not receive a love of the truth
[1:04:22] it didn't mean they didn't hear the
[1:04:23] truth but they didn't have a love of the
[1:04:26] truth
[1:04:28] so you have to receive the love of the
[1:04:31] truth
[1:04:32] doesn't that's why intellectualism will
[1:04:34] never work
[1:04:36] intellectualism in the message will
[1:04:37] never work but you must receive the
[1:04:39] person
[1:04:40] of the word receive the love of the
[1:04:41] truth
[1:04:43] all right so with all deceivableness of
[1:04:48] unrighteousness
[1:04:49] and them that perish because they
[1:04:51] receive not the love of the truth that
[1:04:52] they might be saved
[1:04:54] and for this cause god shall send them
[1:04:56] strong delusions
[1:04:58] that they should believe a lie that they
[1:05:01] all might be damned who believe not the
[1:05:03] truth but had pleasure
[1:05:04] and unrighteousness brother branham when
[1:05:07] he reads this passage he said believe
[1:05:09] a lie brother rem says it should be
[1:05:11] translated here i looked it in the
[1:05:13] lexicon
[1:05:14] the lie not a lie the lie
[1:05:17] the same one he told eve
[1:05:20] so brother branham comes right back and
[1:05:22] says it's not elia it's it's the
[1:05:24] lie and what's the lie it's the same lie
[1:05:27] he told
[1:05:28] eve what was the lie he told eve
[1:05:31] surely not i mean i know god said that
[1:05:35] but
[1:05:35] not for you not the way you think
[1:05:39] i mean you're a child of god you're
[1:05:42] you're you come out of adam you're
[1:05:45] you're one of the chosen you're one of
[1:05:46] the elected
[1:05:47] i mean surely god wouldn't cast you to
[1:05:49] hell god wouldn't
[1:05:50] destroy you god wouldn't let you die
[1:05:55] same line then one lie
[1:05:59] the lie is these things don't matter
[1:06:04] hallelujah brother bram says in the
[1:06:07] second seal
[1:06:08] notice wisdom and smartness they said
[1:06:10] now looky here
[1:06:11] isn't it only sensible that are women
[1:06:14] what difference does it make how they
[1:06:16] wear their hair
[1:06:17] but the bible says it does make a
[1:06:19] difference just take that one thing
[1:06:21] besides the hundreds of others see
[1:06:23] it does make a difference god said it
[1:06:25] made a difference so it's a difference
[1:06:28] so that shrewdness comes in and it
[1:06:30] doesn't make a difference
[1:06:31] and the bible said it makes a difference
[1:06:33] brother member said it makes a
[1:06:34] difference
[1:06:36] but the shrewdness will always try to
[1:06:39] compromise
[1:06:41] he didn't want eve to reject god
[1:06:44] he never asked eve to reject adam he
[1:06:47] never
[1:06:47] asked eve to disbelieve all the word he
[1:06:50] asked her to compromise on the word
[1:06:53] in the message one that's brother bram
[1:06:55] said now when adam and eve listened to
[1:06:56] the lie of the devil
[1:06:58] the holy image of god left them their
[1:07:00] fellowship was broken with god their
[1:07:02] fellowship of oneness with god was
[1:07:04] broken
[1:07:05] the very minute they listened to the lie
[1:07:07] of the devil
[1:07:08] that broke their fellowship and the very
[1:07:10] minute that you listen to the lie of the
[1:07:12] devil it'll break your fellowship
[1:07:15] the very minute you i we listen to the
[1:07:18] lie of the devil
[1:07:19] it will break your fellowship that
[1:07:22] doesn't mean you can't repent that
[1:07:23] doesn't mean you're not in redemption
[1:07:24] that doesn't mean anything
[1:07:25] but the minute you listen to that
[1:07:27] compromising spirit you break your
[1:07:29] fellowship
[1:07:34] that's the very minute you go out from
[1:07:36] the presence of god like she did
[1:07:38] is when you fail to take god's word just
[1:07:40] as
[1:07:41] it is you see
[1:07:45] the devil is trying under this white
[1:07:48] horse rider
[1:07:49] to bring in compromise or a slight
[1:07:52] deviation from the truth
[1:07:55] and that's how he started in the first
[1:07:56] church age he didn't he didn't try to
[1:07:59] start up other organizations and other
[1:08:01] churches and deny the faith and all
[1:08:04] he just tried a little subtle uh saying
[1:08:07] became deeds of the nicolaitans he
[1:08:10] wasn't starting a doctrine
[1:08:12] it's just a saying this is just
[1:08:14] something we do
[1:08:16] it can't hurt anybody it's a bow with no
[1:08:18] arrows
[1:08:20] it's a rider with no crown how can this
[1:08:23] hurt it's just something we do
[1:08:25] it's just our family tradition this is
[1:08:27] just something how can this hurt
[1:08:30] if it's different than what the prophet
[1:08:32] said it will hurt
[1:08:34] brother ben said in case you're
[1:08:36] wondering about that
[1:08:38] i'm going to go to a quote brother ben
[1:08:41] i'm saying in the token
[1:08:43] now if you doubt that at all go listen
[1:08:44] to the token if you doubt all these
[1:08:47] little things matter go listen to the
[1:08:48] token
[1:08:50] he says don't just come this far and say
[1:08:52] i believe the message
[1:08:56] oh praise god so we know that that that
[1:09:00] the greatest evidence brother venom said
[1:09:02] i know of
[1:09:03] is being able to receive the word for
[1:09:04] your day that's the greatest evidence of
[1:09:05] the holy ghost
[1:09:06] but he's not talking about receiving it
[1:09:08] here he come to preach the token to get
[1:09:11] us to recognize
[1:09:12] it's not being able to say i believe he
[1:09:14] says you can say i believe every word of
[1:09:16] he said that's just being able to read
[1:09:18] but he came amen amen the message did
[1:09:21] not come
[1:09:22] to to bring an understanding where you
[1:09:24] say i agree with all those doctrines
[1:09:26] i agree with all that truth and the
[1:09:28] token he's telling you it's not agreeing
[1:09:30] it's living it's the life of jesus
[1:09:32] christ it's taking
[1:09:34] the word and living it out
[1:09:38] he said don't just come this far and say
[1:09:40] i believe the message
[1:09:41] you obey the messenger
[1:09:46] well that's brother brenham's opinion he
[1:09:48] says you obey
[1:09:50] the messenger hallelujah
[1:09:55] come in to christ well i believe every
[1:09:58] word said brother
[1:09:59] that's good but that's just being able
[1:10:01] to read take the message
[1:10:03] take it into your heart that you must
[1:10:05] have the token
[1:10:06] the very life that was in christ be in
[1:10:09] you
[1:10:10] when i see that i will pass over you
[1:10:12] outside of that
[1:10:14] there's not redemption claims made yet
[1:10:18] outside of taking the message into your
[1:10:21] heart
[1:10:22] not reasoning it not trying to find out
[1:10:24] what brother van was right or wrong
[1:10:26] not trying to correct the prophet or say
[1:10:28] that's his opinion or that doesn't apply
[1:10:30] today
[1:10:30] or that was for another time none of
[1:10:32] that will work you obey the messenger
[1:10:34] you come into christ
[1:10:35] you take that whole word inside and then
[1:10:37] you live the whole life of jesus christ
[1:10:40] and it's not a life that you live it's a
[1:10:41] life that he lives in you
[1:10:43] but you're never going to get there with
[1:10:45] compromise the moment you begin to
[1:10:47] deviate from what's been taught to us in
[1:10:48] this age
[1:10:49] you break your fellowship with god and
[1:10:51] the horse rider begins to ride in your
[1:10:53] life
[1:10:55] this isn't about the church ages it is
[1:10:57] he taught us accurately what happened in
[1:10:58] the church age the seals cover the
[1:11:00] churches
[1:11:00] accurately but it's about more than that
[1:11:02] it's about understanding how lucifer is
[1:11:04] trying to penetrate your fortress every
[1:11:06] day
[1:11:07] it's about how he's trying to come to
[1:11:08] your home to your house
[1:11:10] to your mind and he's knocking on your
[1:11:12] door trying to come in
[1:11:14] and he doesn't show up as a black horse
[1:11:17] he doesn't come hooded as the grim
[1:11:19] reaper hey can i come in today
[1:11:22] nobody nobody in their right mind he
[1:11:24] came in to deceive the elect if it was
[1:11:26] possible
[1:11:27] that wouldn't even deceive a nominal
[1:11:29] believer in the presbyterian church
[1:11:32] he doesn't come as the red horse rider
[1:11:34] he doesn't come as the white horse rider
[1:11:36] he doesn't come in the pale horse he
[1:11:38] comes in the white horse
[1:11:41] and he comes harmless
[1:11:45] a bow with no arrows
[1:11:48] i'm not going to hurt you it started as
[1:11:51] a saying in the first church age what
[1:11:54] harm is there in talking about it
[1:11:56] [Laughter]
[1:11:59] he started just talking to eve just
[1:12:02] reasoning a little bit what's wrong with
[1:12:04] you know debating a little bit
[1:12:08] i'm just talking about these things
[1:12:10] white horse rider
[1:12:13] the white horse now these horses you
[1:12:15] have to understand are anointings or
[1:12:17] powers
[1:12:18] there's not four different writers
[1:12:20] although we say all the time horse
[1:12:22] riders
[1:12:22] brother brimston horse riders but he
[1:12:24] made it really clear there's only one
[1:12:26] horse rider
[1:12:28] and he's changing horses
[1:12:31] so if this is the black battle plan we
[1:12:33] have to understand
[1:12:34] his goal is not to stay on the white
[1:12:36] horse
[1:12:38] his goal is to change horses
[1:12:41] and change horses until he finally winds
[1:12:44] up on the pale horse which is spiritual
[1:12:46] death eternal separation from god
[1:12:50] that's the goal that's where he wants to
[1:12:52] go every time
[1:12:54] so when he comes in with when he comes
[1:12:56] to you
[1:12:57] with a bow and no arrows and he's not
[1:12:59] wearing a crown he comes
[1:13:00] as innocent as though he can't hurt you
[1:13:03] how can i hurt you
[1:13:05] i'm non-threatening it's just a saying
[1:13:07] it's just a thought it's just something
[1:13:09] to think about it's
[1:13:10] it's it's not that bad
[1:13:13] nobody knows
[1:13:18] that's the power anointing of the white
[1:13:20] horse
[1:13:22] and remember he only starts riding the
[1:13:26] white horse
[1:13:27] so that he can eventually be on the pale
[1:13:29] horse
[1:13:30] his whole works is the destruction of
[1:13:33] god's people and the discrediting of
[1:13:35] god's word
[1:13:36] that's his whole works he's not going to
[1:13:39] knock on your door
[1:13:40] and say i'm lucifer how are you having a
[1:13:42] nice day he comes in
[1:13:44] on a white horse as close to christ as
[1:13:46] he can look
[1:13:50] but brother brenham said he said this
[1:13:53] horse that this writer remembers the
[1:13:56] same writer all the way through
[1:13:58] so he it's not changing riders
[1:14:01] changing horses or anointings or modes
[1:14:04] of operation
[1:14:06] but he's going to start in your life in
[1:14:09] septility and cunningness and craftiness
[1:14:11] and deception
[1:14:13] looking good looking right but his goal
[1:14:16] is to get to the pale horse to have you
[1:14:20] eternally
[1:14:20] separated from god good news is those
[1:14:24] whose names are on the
[1:14:26] on the lamb's book of life sealed under
[1:14:28] that scroll will never be separated from
[1:14:30] god
[1:14:32] but he comes in with subtility and he
[1:14:35] comes in
[1:14:36] seemingly good but it's a it's always
[1:14:39] just a little different just a slight
[1:14:43] deviation from the word
[1:14:45] just a reasoning just a surmising just a
[1:14:49] a figuring and his goal is to take you
[1:14:53] off
[1:14:54] now you realize when he comes to you he
[1:14:57] has no crown
[1:14:58] and he has no weapon he actually can't
[1:15:01] do anything to you
[1:15:03] when you know your position when he
[1:15:04] comes in as a compromiser and he comes
[1:15:06] in with seduction
[1:15:07] he can't do a thing to you but in the
[1:15:10] first church age brother branham says
[1:15:12] in the first church age he was given a
[1:15:14] crown
[1:15:16] who gave him the crown in the first
[1:15:18] church age he said the pope was
[1:15:20] eventually crowned as the head of the
[1:15:21] church
[1:15:22] who was it that gave him the who gave
[1:15:23] him the crown
[1:15:25] the church and when the horse when the
[1:15:28] horse rider comes into your life
[1:15:30] and the white horse and compromised amen
[1:15:33] you're the one who puts the crown on his
[1:15:35] head
[1:15:37] he has no authority whatsoever over you
[1:15:40] but when you open the door and let him
[1:15:41] ride in your life
[1:15:42] you put the crown on his head
[1:15:45] and now he begins to dominate your life
[1:15:49] what started off as a subtle difference
[1:15:50] what started off as just a little
[1:15:52] different than the message
[1:15:53] now after he comes in you put a crown on
[1:15:56] his on his head and he begins to
[1:15:58] dominate your life
[1:16:00] praise god
[1:16:04] so what are we watching for are you
[1:16:08] watching for a guy
[1:16:10] with a fork stick wearing a red suit and
[1:16:12] little horns
[1:16:13] you're watching for anything different
[1:16:15] than the pure word of god
[1:16:18] anything different than the absolute
[1:16:20] truth of god
[1:16:23] oh praise god now
[1:16:26] let's whoever's brought their seal book
[1:16:29] we can open up seal books if you didn't
[1:16:31] i'll read to you we should read it
[1:16:33] silently to punish all those who don't
[1:16:34] have the steel books
[1:16:36] but we won't do that because we're
[1:16:38] loving
[1:16:41] amen i'm just kidding
[1:16:46] first seal let's go to paragraph 21.
[1:16:50] you know i told you before that
[1:16:51] oftentimes brother branham when the
[1:16:53] first few minutes of preaching you see
[1:16:55] he gives you a preview of what the whole
[1:16:56] seal is about and so this is this is a
[1:16:58] good one here
[1:17:00] and in the first seal early on
[1:17:03] when he's when he just starts to preach
[1:17:05] in paragraph 21 on page 107.
[1:17:09] he says brother vale brother leave veil
[1:17:11] i think he's here
[1:17:13] we were talking the other day about
[1:17:14] people who getting people who are
[1:17:16] getting off track
[1:17:18] it's just like shooting a target if that
[1:17:19] gun is perfectly balanced perfectly
[1:17:21] trained and sighted
[1:17:22] it's got to hit the target unless the
[1:17:24] barrel moves or twists or vibration
[1:17:26] throws it off or a wind puff
[1:17:28] wherever it starts off at there is only
[1:17:31] one way to do it is to come
[1:17:33] back to where it left track and start
[1:17:35] again
[1:17:37] if it's going to hit the target if it
[1:17:39] doesn't why
[1:17:40] it just doesn't hit the target we want
[1:17:43] to hit the target but what the devil's
[1:17:44] trying to do
[1:17:45] is get us a slight deviation off
[1:17:49] and if he can get you back here just
[1:17:52] ever just a fraction of a millimeter
[1:17:56] i mean so much you can never see it with
[1:17:58] your eye
[1:17:59] you could adjust it if you had your gun
[1:18:02] clamped in a gun stand
[1:18:03] clamped in a gun vise and you had it
[1:18:05] dead on at 250 yards
[1:18:08] pull the trigger dead on all you have to
[1:18:10] do is turn that little nut one time
[1:18:14] and nobody will be able to see that it's
[1:18:17] any different whatsoever
[1:18:19] you can't see it you can't tell it's
[1:18:21] such a small change
[1:18:23] back here that surely it's not
[1:18:25] significant
[1:18:26] but fire that garden in 250 yards you're
[1:18:29] going to find out what a big difference
[1:18:31] that is
[1:18:32] because he's called us to the pure life
[1:18:34] and the pure word the pure word's been
[1:18:36] restored to us
[1:18:37] and he doesn't want us to compromise
[1:18:38] anymore he doesn't want us to deviate
[1:18:40] from it he wants us to line up to the
[1:18:42] message
[1:18:44] and then you pull the trigger it hits
[1:18:46] pull the trigger hits pull the trigger
[1:18:47] it hits
[1:18:48] and when we start pulling the trigger
[1:18:49] and it's not hitting we got to come back
[1:18:52] to how are we lined up to the message of
[1:18:54] the hour
[1:18:54] how are we lined up to this word this
[1:18:57] prophet came
[1:18:58] and he restored back to us the full word
[1:19:00] of god
[1:19:01] but he showed us how to live in the day
[1:19:03] that we're living in
[1:19:04] he showed us how to fight devils how to
[1:19:06] stay true to the word he
[1:19:08] demonstrated in his life he preached it
[1:19:10] over and over and over again
[1:19:12] and we're expected to line to it
[1:19:15] and if you line to it and you stay lined
[1:19:18] to it
[1:19:19] that white horse rider will never start
[1:19:21] writing in your life
[1:19:24] he'll never start from day one
[1:19:27] and if he never starts then you always
[1:19:30] hit the target
[1:19:32] but what the devil trying to do through
[1:19:34] subtility cunning craftiness
[1:19:36] just a slight change
[1:19:40] seemingly insignificant and it doesn't
[1:19:42] really
[1:19:43] matter oh praise god
[1:19:49] in the first seal let's go to paragraph
[1:19:51] 77.
[1:19:59] page 115 paragraph 77
[1:20:03] we'll find out in a minute it even
[1:20:05] worked in the name of a church
[1:20:06] they call themselves the church and you
[1:20:08] just see if it isn't right
[1:20:10] no wonder i've been so against the
[1:20:11] nomination not knowing why
[1:20:13] they end up now it starts back here in a
[1:20:16] mild form and it just keeps getting
[1:20:18] worse and worse
[1:20:19] on down and the people go right into it
[1:20:21] saying oh yes this is just fine
[1:20:24] but in the last days these things are
[1:20:27] made known
[1:20:28] so the problem is he tries in a mild
[1:20:31] form to get you to take something that's
[1:20:33] different than what the messenger
[1:20:34] brought
[1:20:35] and then and then he wants to get worse
[1:20:37] and worse and worse
[1:20:39] until you get down here and all along he
[1:20:42] wants the people say oh that's just fine
[1:20:44] it's just fine it doesn't matter it's
[1:20:47] not a big deal
[1:20:48] it it has no arrows it can't hurt me
[1:20:53] that's the deception paragraph 131
[1:21:12] it's not paragraph 131 paragraph 134
[1:21:15] sorry
[1:21:17] now remember it wasn't russian no the
[1:21:19] antichrist is a smooth fella
[1:21:21] just watch how smooth he is he is smart
[1:21:23] now yes sir
[1:21:25] just takes the holy spirit the only
[1:21:27] thing that can outdo him
[1:21:30] there's nothing else you cannot tangle
[1:21:32] with this deception
[1:21:33] only the holy ghost and the holy ghost
[1:21:36] always lines up to the word
[1:21:42] praise god
[1:21:46] brother ben said i'll just quote this
[1:21:48] one to you god has promised that when
[1:21:50] the word is refused then they are turned
[1:21:52] to their desires now you have to
[1:21:54] recognize that though
[1:21:56] that that old cockleburst sticky nature
[1:21:59] is always hovering over you trying to
[1:22:01] get you to go wrong again
[1:22:02] amen and when we refuse the word that
[1:22:05] old nature is going to begin to
[1:22:07] influence again
[1:22:09] and so so when you refuse the word
[1:22:12] you're just turned to your desires and
[1:22:14] romans 1 28 says and even as they did
[1:22:16] not like to retain god and their
[1:22:17] knowledge
[1:22:18] god gave them over to a reprobate mind
[1:22:20] to do those things which are not
[1:22:22] convenient why did they get turned over
[1:22:25] to reprobate mine
[1:22:26] they did not like to retain god in their
[1:22:28] knowledge
[1:22:32] there's a couple here i want to read
[1:22:33] together
[1:22:35] second seal let's turn over to the
[1:22:37] second seal
[1:22:39] paragraph 118
[1:22:49] paragraph 118 page 173
[1:22:56] now christ comes into the antichrist
[1:22:58] comes into light gradually i want you to
[1:23:00] notice this
[1:23:02] now to my catholic friends just sit
[1:23:04] still just a minute now
[1:23:05] and we're going to see where the
[1:23:06] protestants where we all are see
[1:23:09] notice the first church when the
[1:23:11] catholic church says they were the first
[1:23:13] the original church
[1:23:14] they're exactly right
[1:23:17] they were they began at pentecost that's
[1:23:20] where the catholic church began
[1:23:22] now i once didn't hardly believe that
[1:23:23] until i read history and i found that
[1:23:25] it's right
[1:23:26] they began at pentecost but they began
[1:23:28] to drift
[1:23:29] and you see where they're at so you see
[1:23:32] brother branham is laying these
[1:23:34] these horse these horse powers in this
[1:23:37] horse rider
[1:23:38] over the church ages and he's showing
[1:23:40] that the catholic church started out
[1:23:41] right
[1:23:43] it started out true it started out
[1:23:44] correct but through subtility through
[1:23:47] the white horse
[1:23:48] not the black horse not the red horse
[1:23:50] not the pale horse
[1:23:52] but through the white horse they were
[1:23:53] deceived and starting in another
[1:23:55] direction
[1:23:56] ever so slightly different but by the
[1:23:58] time you get down in the church ages
[1:24:00] you recognize that we stand here today
[1:24:02] and you can see what that church system
[1:24:04] is
[1:24:05] it's nothing like what it started at and
[1:24:07] what started it down the wrong road
[1:24:09] it was a very slight difference from
[1:24:12] truth
[1:24:13] very subtle difference from truth now
[1:24:15] we've got to take this home we've got to
[1:24:17] bring this right to our lives
[1:24:19] we have to say this is me amen the
[1:24:22] church ages was fine
[1:24:23] but this is exposing the works of satan
[1:24:25] and me and if i've got compromise in my
[1:24:27] life i need to go rooted out
[1:24:29] and repent and cast that thing out of my
[1:24:31] life because the goal is spiritual
[1:24:33] separation from god
[1:24:35] spiritual death is the goal the goal of
[1:24:36] compromise is death
[1:24:38] not compromise the devil doesn't
[1:24:42] he's not after you to live in compromise
[1:24:47] he's trying to get you to compromise to
[1:24:49] go to death
[1:24:50] he's trying to destroy god's people and
[1:24:53] discredit god's word
[1:24:54] his end goal is not compromise he
[1:24:57] starts in compromise the end goal is
[1:25:00] death
[1:25:02] he's not your friend he's not trying to
[1:25:05] get you to have more fun
[1:25:07] amen he's trying to destroy your life
[1:25:13] in the second seal paragraph 160.
[1:25:22] yeah paragraph 160. now the natural
[1:25:26] first bride of the human race before her
[1:25:28] husband came to her she fell from grace
[1:25:30] by listening to satan's lie and after
[1:25:32] god had for
[1:25:33] fortified behind his word if she would
[1:25:36] have stayed behind the word
[1:25:37] she would have never fell now that's the
[1:25:40] natural notice the natural woman
[1:25:42] and what was the curse the actual curse
[1:25:44] of coming out from behind god's word
[1:25:47] now we talk about hybridization and the
[1:25:51] original sin being sex in the garden
[1:25:53] but actually what cursed them was
[1:25:55] denying god's word
[1:25:57] this belief the the only sin is still
[1:26:00] the only sin
[1:26:01] the only sin is disbelief unbelief is
[1:26:04] sin
[1:26:06] what was sex act and hybridization it
[1:26:08] was
[1:26:09] fruits of the sin but the actual curse
[1:26:12] they weren't cursed because of sex
[1:26:16] they were cursed because of disbelief in
[1:26:18] god's word
[1:26:20] and if that worked for adam and eve what
[1:26:22] do you think will happen to us
[1:26:23] if we disbelieve doubt reason with one
[1:26:26] of god's word
[1:26:27] and and brother bam said this whole
[1:26:29] curse came
[1:26:30] from disbelieving one of god's words one
[1:26:33] one of his commandments
[1:26:34] how are we going to get back having one
[1:26:36] wrong
[1:26:37] that's what brother branham tells us
[1:26:39] we've got to line up why did the message
[1:26:41] come
[1:26:42] to line up a bride to dress a bride in
[1:26:45] the garment of the word
[1:26:46] amen it was the prophet who saw the
[1:26:48] preview of the bride and in the preview
[1:26:50] of the bride he sees a perfect bride
[1:26:52] coming by
[1:26:53] and my she's glorious and everything's
[1:26:55] just right and then he sees another one
[1:26:56] and he looks at the worldly church
[1:26:58] amen and he sees this worldly church led
[1:27:01] by a witch totally undressed
[1:27:02] marching to the time of twisting rock
[1:27:04] and roll music and she's going off into
[1:27:06] destruction
[1:27:07] and his heart's broken because he thinks
[1:27:09] this is the best that i've produced for
[1:27:11] the lord and then he hears
[1:27:12] music playing again onward christian
[1:27:14] soldiers and he sees another bride
[1:27:16] coming just like the first bride
[1:27:18] and she's marching and everything's just
[1:27:20] right but at the end time
[1:27:22] at the very end he sees two that are
[1:27:24] getting out of time
[1:27:25] out of rhythm with the march amen and
[1:27:27] what were they doing they were watching
[1:27:29] the worldly church they had their eyes
[1:27:32] now when they came by the stand the
[1:27:35] preview stand
[1:27:36] brother branham was there amen and the
[1:27:38] angel of the lord was over his right
[1:27:39] shoulder
[1:27:40] and whenever they came by the preview
[1:27:41] stand they looked at him
[1:27:46] but there's two in the back looking at
[1:27:47] something else
[1:27:49] they're looking at the worldly church
[1:27:51] going into destruction and they're
[1:27:52] getting out of time
[1:27:53] and the prophet wakes up in his bed
[1:27:55] screaming get back in step
[1:27:58] get back in step what is he calling
[1:28:01] what's the message calling for us
[1:28:02] it wasn't just to teach us the seven
[1:28:04] seals it was to get us back in step
[1:28:06] amen it was to put us in that perfect
[1:28:08] bride in line and step with the world
[1:28:11] and what do we have to be looking at you
[1:28:13] have to be looking at the angel of the
[1:28:14] lord and the prophet
[1:28:18] you cannot be ignoring this message and
[1:28:19] know how to live
[1:28:21] there's absolutely no way you're going
[1:28:22] to be an overcomer in this day
[1:28:24] if the only quotes that you hear are the
[1:28:26] ones that are read here on sunday and
[1:28:27] wednesday
[1:28:28] you will never overcome lucifer you will
[1:28:30] never defeat him
[1:28:33] that bride was in preview and when they
[1:28:36] crossed they were watching what was on
[1:28:38] the platform
[1:28:40] not the worldly church
[1:28:44] we we have to be careful that we line up
[1:28:47] to the message
[1:28:50] line up to the word the devil's trying
[1:28:54] to get us to
[1:28:54] any distraction anything from looking at
[1:28:56] this word
[1:28:59] sunday and wednesday religion will not
[1:29:00] put you in the rapture
[1:29:04] it's not going to work friends it's got
[1:29:06] to be a
[1:29:07] whole life a whole selling out
[1:29:11] an absolute surrender a complete death
[1:29:14] to self
[1:29:15] and there's a feeding on the word of god
[1:29:17] feeding on the message of the hour
[1:29:19] until it changes our lives until we
[1:29:21] invite it into our lives
[1:29:23] and we recognize that the prophet says
[1:29:25] something and i've been doing something
[1:29:27] else
[1:29:27] god changed my life i repent forgive me
[1:29:30] o god and line me back to your word
[1:29:33] that is the only way that this bride is
[1:29:35] going to overcome if not
[1:29:37] amen if not you deviate and we've seen
[1:29:40] people who deviate ever so slightly by
[1:29:42] reasoning of the word
[1:29:44] amen and if you watch their lives 10 15
[1:29:46] 20 years later
[1:29:47] they don't look anything like even a
[1:29:49] nominal christian
[1:29:52] having atheistic views or are human
[1:29:56] humanistic views and not even believing
[1:29:58] the word of god anymore
[1:30:00] what started it a slight deviation from
[1:30:03] the truth
[1:30:04] and what is truth the message of this
[1:30:06] hour is truth
[1:30:11] don't reason it believe it accept it
[1:30:15] invite it into your life ask god
[1:30:20] to give you overcoming power by a spirit
[1:30:24] paragraph 161 we read and what was the
[1:30:27] curse the actual curse of coming out
[1:30:28] from behind god's word
[1:30:30] and now remember she believed about 98
[1:30:33] of it but you just have to let one thing
[1:30:36] go
[1:30:37] see she believed a whole lot of it oh
[1:30:39] certain
[1:30:40] she said this and satan would admit that
[1:30:42] it was right if he can just get you
[1:30:45] on one corner that's all he wants
[1:30:49] the only thing you have to do is give
[1:30:51] the bullet a little twist
[1:30:52] this way and it'll miss the target
[1:30:54] remember how he started
[1:30:56] back in paragraph 21
[1:30:59] give the bullet a little twist this way
[1:31:01] and it'll miss the target
[1:31:03] that's all now she believed so much of
[1:31:05] it but yet
[1:31:07] missed it now and the result
[1:31:10] because she left the word for one little
[1:31:12] speck of reason
[1:31:14] brothers and sisters if it worked then
[1:31:16] it'll work now
[1:31:18] if it took it took out the children of
[1:31:19] god then it'll take out the children of
[1:31:21] god now
[1:31:22] it'll bring you down it'll bring you
[1:31:24] it'll it'll break your fellowship with
[1:31:25] god it'll put you in a condition that
[1:31:27] you don't want to be in
[1:31:28] your life will be out of harmony out of
[1:31:30] step with the word out of kilter with
[1:31:32] what god is doing
[1:31:33] why because we're watching something
[1:31:34] other than what we're supposed to be
[1:31:36] keeping our eyes on
[1:31:37] we're not supposed to watch the worldly
[1:31:38] church or the things of the world or
[1:31:40] anything that has to do with the world
[1:31:42] we're supposed to be living a
[1:31:43] consecrated sold out separated life
[1:31:47] amen let's go to ii corinthians
[1:32:07] see before i read this i just want to
[1:32:10] explain
[1:32:11] the problem in denominational systems
[1:32:13] the problem with churches and humans and
[1:32:15] everything under the sun
[1:32:17] is is is that we've adjusted truth
[1:32:21] based off experience
[1:32:24] now truth can't be adjusted if it's
[1:32:26] truth
[1:32:27] truth is an absolute it's a matter of
[1:32:29] fact it's unchangeable
[1:32:31] we got that and so you can't adjust
[1:32:33] truth
[1:32:35] but the problem is truth has been
[1:32:37] adjusting all along
[1:32:38] in churches so there was a standard
[1:32:42] in the nazarene church back a hundred
[1:32:44] years ago
[1:32:46] and now there's been a standard and that
[1:32:49] standard was holiness they were under
[1:32:50] the wesleyan movement they come out of
[1:32:52] the wesleyan church age
[1:32:53] there was a standard and that was truth
[1:32:56] and they could show it to you in the
[1:32:57] scriptures
[1:32:58] under sanctification but now that was
[1:33:01] the standard
[1:33:02] but now if you go into a nazarene church
[1:33:05] the standard is down here
[1:33:07] now if that was truth is this truth
[1:33:11] which is truth how did truth change
[1:33:14] truth can't change so why are we
[1:33:16] adjusting truth
[1:33:19] it doesn't work so you can see it all
[1:33:21] around when i grew up as a boy in the
[1:33:22] pentecostal church
[1:33:24] there were still quite a few women in
[1:33:25] our church that wouldn't cut their hair
[1:33:27] war dresses all the time and they
[1:33:28] weren't allowed to wear pants
[1:33:30] into the sanctuary that's when i was a
[1:33:32] boy
[1:33:33] and i remember as a young man i was
[1:33:35] young married still going to that same
[1:33:37] church that i grew up in
[1:33:39] and i remember when the women put
[1:33:41] pressure on the pastor
[1:33:43] amen during the bible school saying we
[1:33:45] need to wear pants we can't do
[1:33:46] activities with the kids and dresses and
[1:33:48] skirts
[1:33:49] and i remember when he caved in and they
[1:33:51] all showed up in pants
[1:33:55] so why were you wearing skirts and
[1:33:56] dresses before
[1:33:59] if it wasn't true why were you doing
[1:34:00] something that wasn't true if it wasn't
[1:34:02] the bible why were you doing it
[1:34:04] right they've adjusted truth
[1:34:08] based off the worldly church based off
[1:34:10] the world based off the culture
[1:34:12] truth has been adjusting
[1:34:16] right we have to be careful in the
[1:34:17] message we don't do the same thing
[1:34:20] that we don't adjust holiness we don't
[1:34:23] adjust our standard
[1:34:24] fashions can change holiness doesn't it
[1:34:28] floral print solid color i don't care it
[1:34:30] matters not to me thin tie thick tie i
[1:34:33] could care less
[1:34:34] but the holiness doesn't change because
[1:34:37] the fashions change
[1:34:40] fashions can't change holiness
[1:34:43] if we wouldn't do this before if we
[1:34:46] wouldn't have a television in our house
[1:34:48] before because the prophet said kick it
[1:34:49] out
[1:34:50] how come we'll have one now what changed
[1:34:55] and you can say well because i don't
[1:34:57] have children in the house anymore
[1:34:59] brother branham never referenced that
[1:35:00] based off whether he had children in the
[1:35:01] house or not
[1:35:02] he said when he preached the token he
[1:35:04] said throw out your magazines throw out
[1:35:07] your short skirts throw out your shorts
[1:35:09] throw out your television
[1:35:12] so now we won't have a television but
[1:35:13] we'll get netflix television and bring
[1:35:15] it on our computer
[1:35:16] what's the difference he told us
[1:35:20] to separate from the world
[1:35:24] total separation god calls for total
[1:35:27] separation
[1:35:28] from all unbelief
[1:35:32] brother branham never preached it any
[1:35:33] different he didn't preach compromise
[1:35:35] he was going to compromise he was going
[1:35:39] to let billy paul put a television in
[1:35:40] his house brother brandon explains this
[1:35:43] but the angel of the lord stopped him
[1:35:45] and told him not to
[1:35:48] if the angel of the lord told him not to
[1:35:51] then
[1:35:51] why have we brought it into our homes
[1:35:55] why why is the standard changed has
[1:35:58] truth changed
[1:36:00] is truth ever changing truth shouldn't
[1:36:02] change if it's true it should always be
[1:36:04] true
[1:36:05] we should be lining up to that word
[1:36:07] lining up to that message
[1:36:10] amen why what's the devil trying to do
[1:36:13] slight
[1:36:13] deviation from the truth it doesn't
[1:36:17] matter
[1:36:18] it's under control it's not
[1:36:21] it's different than what the prophet
[1:36:23] taught
[1:36:24] is it different than what the prophet
[1:36:26] taught if it's different than what the
[1:36:28] prophet taught i don't want it because
[1:36:30] i'm not smart enough to figure out if
[1:36:31] it's good or not
[1:36:34] amen if he told us to stay away from
[1:36:37] things stay away from him
[1:36:39] amen if he told us to do things let's do
[1:36:41] it if he told us to take the message in
[1:36:43] our hearts
[1:36:43] take the message into our hearts if he
[1:36:45] told us to obey the messenger then we
[1:36:47] obey the messenger
[1:36:49] we got to quit fooling around but all
[1:36:52] these things are
[1:36:53] are meant to distract us and bring us if
[1:36:55] he can get you on one corner
[1:36:58] then he can get you to lose the whole
[1:37:00] thing what is it
[1:37:02] it's the white horse friends
[1:37:05] none of us there's not one of us are
[1:37:08] going to fall for the red horse or black
[1:37:09] horse
[1:37:11] not one of us are going to fall for the
[1:37:13] pale horse
[1:37:15] spiritual separation but over and over
[1:37:18] that white horse comes knocking on your
[1:37:20] door
[1:37:22] that's the one you're tangling with all
[1:37:24] the time
[1:37:25] that's the antichrist spirit that you're
[1:37:27] fighting constantly
[1:37:29] all day every day slight deviation
[1:37:32] slight reasoning
[1:37:33] acceptance of something we wouldn't
[1:37:34] accept before what is it he's trying to
[1:37:36] get us to accept something
[1:37:38] we would not accept before and and he's
[1:37:41] trying to dupe us why
[1:37:43] he's always working where god's throne
[1:37:45] is
[1:37:46] where is his throne his throne is in you
[1:37:48] and i
[1:37:49] don't think you're immune from the
[1:37:51] attacks of the antichrist he'll come
[1:37:53] every day of your life as a white horse
[1:37:56] as
[1:37:56] innocent as harmless with a bow with no
[1:37:59] arrows and not wearing a crown
[1:38:02] but we've got a method to overcome him
[1:38:05] let's talk about that in just a second
[1:38:06] here
[1:38:08] i think i had everybody turned to i was
[1:38:10] going to anyways let's turn to paragraph
[1:38:11] 137
[1:38:13] and the second seal go back just a
[1:38:15] couple pages
[1:38:22] paragraph 137 you can't make them
[1:38:23] scriptures lie
[1:38:25] they're going to be truthful always the
[1:38:27] only thing don't try to line your
[1:38:28] thought up
[1:38:29] to the script or the scriptures up to
[1:38:30] your thought but line yourself up with
[1:38:32] the scriptures
[1:38:33] that's when you're running with god no
[1:38:35] matter how much you have to cut away
[1:38:37] or lay aside line up with that
[1:38:40] and that'll that'll shave us right down
[1:38:42] friends
[1:38:44] i think i had you turn to second
[1:38:45] corinthians did we ever read that
[1:38:47] thank you guys thank you second
[1:38:49] corinthians chapter six
[1:38:51] i love it when the class is paying
[1:38:53] attention
[1:38:55] second corinthians chapter six verse
[1:38:56] fourteen
[1:39:00] be not unequally yoked together with
[1:39:02] unbelievers for what fellowship hath
[1:39:04] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[1:39:06] what communion hath light with darkness
[1:39:08] and what concord hath christ with belia
[1:39:10] or what part hath he with the
[1:39:12] that believeth with an infidel in what
[1:39:14] agreement has the temple of god with
[1:39:16] idols
[1:39:16] for for ye are the temple of the living
[1:39:19] god as god hath said
[1:39:20] i will dwell in them and walk in them
[1:39:22] and i will be their god
[1:39:23] and they will be my people wherefore
[1:39:26] come out from among them and be ye
[1:39:28] separate saith the lord
[1:39:30] and touch not the unclean and i will
[1:39:32] receive you
[1:39:34] that's the cry that went out in
[1:39:35] revelations 18 and
[1:39:37] talking about the the the false
[1:39:40] church and the false systems
[1:39:41] says come out my people and be not
[1:39:43] partakers of her sins
[1:39:45] we're not supposed to be mingling at all
[1:39:48] we're supposed to be separated
[1:39:51] now you can't leave the world paul
[1:39:53] talked about this in the in the gospels
[1:39:55] he said you would have to leave the
[1:39:56] world but not leaving the world but
[1:39:58] being separate in the world
[1:40:04] let's look at revelations chapter 2.
[1:40:08] let's look at the admonition to the
[1:40:11] ephesian church age the first church age
[1:40:13] when this horse
[1:40:14] first began to ride was in revelations
[1:40:17] chapter 2.
[1:40:24] unto the angel of the church of the of
[1:40:26] ephesus right these things saith he that
[1:40:28] holdeth the seven stars in his right
[1:40:29] hand who walketh in the midst of the
[1:40:31] seven golden candlesticks
[1:40:33] i know thy works thy labor and thy
[1:40:34] patience and how thou canst not bear
[1:40:36] them
[1:40:37] which are evil and thou hast tried them
[1:40:39] which say they are apostles and are not
[1:40:40] and has found them liars and as born and
[1:40:43] has patience and for my name's sake has
[1:40:45] labored and has not fainted
[1:40:47] this church was doing a very good job
[1:40:49] their work was good their labors were
[1:40:51] good their patients they were judging
[1:40:52] false apostles
[1:40:54] they were doing excuse me they were
[1:40:57] doing a fantastic job
[1:40:59] they had been patient for his name's
[1:41:01] sake they labored and has not fainted
[1:41:04] verse 4 nevertheless i have somewhat
[1:41:06] against thee because thou has left thy
[1:41:08] first love
[1:41:10] remember therefore from whence thou art
[1:41:12] fallen and repent and do the first works
[1:41:14] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[1:41:16] and i will remove thy candlestick
[1:41:17] albert's place
[1:41:19] except thou repent now this church was
[1:41:22] doing a good job
[1:41:23] they were doing a very good job they
[1:41:25] were they had works they had patience
[1:41:26] they were
[1:41:27] judging apostles and casting them out
[1:41:29] but he had someone against them because
[1:41:30] they had left their first love
[1:41:34] and he says go back to your first love
[1:41:38] do you remember when you went through
[1:41:40] first coming to the message those who
[1:41:41] were outside and come to the truth
[1:41:46] that was your first love and the
[1:41:48] scripture says
[1:41:49] do the first works
[1:41:54] we got duped friends and people calling
[1:41:56] that our legalistic face
[1:42:00] that wasn't our legalistic phase that
[1:42:03] was our first love
[1:42:06] and some people in the message have come
[1:42:07] along and said remember when you through
[1:42:09] your legalistic phase
[1:42:10] oh it's better now that you'll reason on
[1:42:12] the word and allow things in that the
[1:42:13] prophet
[1:42:14] didn't allow you you've grown a little
[1:42:18] bit in the lord and you've come to a
[1:42:19] position now where
[1:42:20] you can discern for yourself you don't
[1:42:22] have to exactly toe the line
[1:42:24] anymore brothers and sisters that wasn't
[1:42:26] your legalistic phase that was your
[1:42:28] first love you were so in love with him
[1:42:31] you didn't want anything of the world
[1:42:33] you would throw out things you would
[1:42:34] separate
[1:42:35] you would do whatever what is that
[1:42:36] that's your first love
[1:42:38] and then the white horse rider the
[1:42:40] antichrist spirit come in and taught us
[1:42:42] how to compromise
[1:42:43] taught us how to reason taught us how to
[1:42:45] justify things
[1:42:46] we would have never justified when we
[1:42:48] first came to the message
[1:42:52] and he says repent and do the first
[1:42:55] works
[1:42:58] that's not your legalistic phase that's
[1:43:01] your first love
[1:43:02] i think it's time we repent and come
[1:43:05] back to our first love
[1:43:06] and repent and do the first works i
[1:43:09] think it's time to
[1:43:10] throw out worldly influences throw out
[1:43:12] food from the false
[1:43:13] vine friends that you remember that that
[1:43:16] that last church in preview was watching
[1:43:18] the false
[1:43:19] vine the false church
[1:43:23] and we have been duped into accepting
[1:43:25] fruit from the false vine
[1:43:28] listening to their music singing their
[1:43:30] songs watching their movies
[1:43:33] that does not come from the true vine
[1:43:38] that doesn't come from the true vine it
[1:43:40] comes from the knowledge of the tree of
[1:43:42] good and evil so on that is a hybrid a
[1:43:46] mix there is some good
[1:43:47] and there is some evil but why do you
[1:43:51] want to drink out of a contaminated well
[1:43:53] when there's a pure river of life
[1:43:56] flowing clean
[1:43:58] there's two wells i told this to the
[1:43:59] young people friday night you've got two
[1:44:01] wells
[1:44:02] in this well it's good and bad
[1:44:06] some people drink it and get sick some
[1:44:08] people drink it and have no problem
[1:44:10] some people drink it and they're fine
[1:44:12] some people get it drinking sick and
[1:44:13] some have even died
[1:44:15] now here's a well this is certified
[1:44:17] tested and pure
[1:44:19] and everybody who gets this gets
[1:44:20] stronger and healthier drinking out of
[1:44:21] this one
[1:44:22] you pick which one you want to drink
[1:44:25] from
[1:44:27] i want to watch the little love movie
[1:44:29] that's christian
[1:44:32] i want to listen to my favorite band my
[1:44:34] favorite group

[1:45:40] scriptures we've got thus
[1:45:41] saith the lord on the word why are we
[1:45:43] polluting our mind
[1:45:45] it's the white horse friends not the
[1:45:48] white horse in ephesus
[1:45:49] the white horse right here right in my
[1:45:52] house
[1:45:53] right in my little entertainment console
[1:45:55] right next to my computer

[1:46:00] your favorites page
[1:46:01] on your on your internet go look on your
[1:46:04] favorites page and see if there's any
[1:46:05] white horses there
[1:46:08] what takes all our time why is it we're
[1:46:10] not in the word because
[1:46:12] we play video games and we read nonsense
[1:46:15] books we read
[1:46:16] we read what's romance novels with a
[1:46:18] christian label
[1:46:20] oh my goodness friends throw away the
[1:46:23] trash that's what brother brennan
[1:46:24] preached in the token go back this week
[1:46:26] and listen to the token
[1:46:27] and you tell me if i'm right or wrong
[1:46:29] tell me if i'm being legalistic telling
[1:46:31] i'm being too hard go listen to the
[1:46:33] token
[1:46:33] and you listen to every word he says and
[1:46:35] you tell me whether this is nothing but
[1:46:37] the truth the gospel of jesus christ
[1:46:40] to keep a bride virgin and pure and
[1:46:42] clean and bringing her to the rapture
[1:46:45] see we forget so many times we've we've
[1:46:47] grown up in this world and we've got
[1:46:49] these senses that that
[1:46:50] drag us back into this society we're not
[1:46:53] born
[1:46:54] for this society we're not born for this
[1:46:55] world we weren't placed here just to
[1:46:57] operate in life
[1:46:58] we were placed here to take a body
[1:47:00] change we were put here at this
[1:47:02] generation at this time
[1:47:03] to receive the full word without measure
[1:47:06] and the full life that goes with it to
[1:47:08] take a rapture to get a perfect word
[1:47:10] for a perfect faith for a perfect
[1:47:11] rapture why are we still
[1:47:13] mingling it with other seed
[1:47:17] throw it out throw it out
[1:47:21] and say god i want a pure word
[1:47:24] a perfect word for a perfect faith
[1:47:28] for a perfect rapture when we begin to
[1:47:32] accept things off the false vine
[1:47:34] and we begin to deviate from what the
[1:47:36] messenger told us that we believe begin
[1:47:38] living different than the token message
[1:47:42] then we're being influenced by the white
[1:47:43] horse
[1:47:45] so what do we do god sent another power
[1:47:59] the reverend says now satan raises those
[1:48:01] watch the shrewdness of this fellow
[1:48:03] we're talking about here
[1:48:04] we're unfolding him right here just
[1:48:07] stripping him down by the scriptures and
[1:48:09] letting you see who he is
[1:48:12] you may feel a little stripped down i've
[1:48:14] been stripped down by this word we all
[1:48:16] get stripped down by this word
[1:48:17] you may be here feeling like you're
[1:48:19] overexposed and been stripped down
[1:48:20] it's not you that stripped down we're
[1:48:22] stripping the white horse the antichrist
[1:48:24] spirit
[1:48:24] that is trying to run in your life
[1:48:27] that's who's being stripped down
[1:48:28] let him get stripped down don't you get
[1:48:30] stripped down strip him down
[1:48:32] expose him in your life call him out for
[1:48:34] what he is say this is the influence of
[1:48:36] the white horse
[1:48:37] i taught this in my family we had a
[1:48:39] family devotion
[1:48:40] and and we did the devotion and
[1:48:43] everybody went to bed and i go up
[1:48:45] and my little boys nine and 11 years old
[1:48:47] had a stack of books
[1:48:49] and we had we had little books it was a
[1:48:52] abridged children's versions of classics
[1:48:56] they had a stack here of abridged
[1:48:58] children's version of old
[1:49:00] classic novels and my boy said dad
[1:49:02] that's the white horse rider we got to
[1:49:04] throw it away
[1:49:07] what was it wizard of oz full of magic
[1:49:11] and nonsense books like that
[1:49:15] full of things love stories things that
[1:49:18] shouldn't be in there
[1:49:19] i never noticed it i overlooked it but i
[1:49:22] taught it to my family
[1:49:23] my little boys rooted it out they had a
[1:49:25] stack laying there and i carried it out
[1:49:27] to the garbage and threw it away
[1:49:29] i was ever so happy i would have left it
[1:49:31] right there because i didn't i wasn't
[1:49:32] even thinking about it
[1:49:33] but they saw it they exposed it
[1:49:37] they kicked it out you can teach this to
[1:49:39] your children they want to know
[1:49:42] they're not hungry to live like the rest
[1:49:44] of the world you tell them their
[1:49:45] position in christ you tell them they're
[1:49:47] born into your family for a reason
[1:49:48] they've heard this message for a reason
[1:49:50] if they can accept it and believe it
[1:49:52] with all of their heart
[1:49:53] then they're going to go on a rapture
[1:49:54] because they're children of god's seed
[1:49:56] of god planted here for an end time
[1:49:57] victory to defeat the devil
[1:49:59] you tell me those kids won't get
[1:50:00] inspired by that they don't want the
[1:50:02] world
[1:50:02] they want to be overcomers they want
[1:50:05] something different than the false and
[1:50:07] the phony and the charades that go on in
[1:50:09] life
[1:50:09] they want a reality give them a reality
[1:50:13] don't give them the white horse
[1:50:16] we're stripping him down by the
[1:50:17] scriptures letting you see who he is
[1:50:19] what's supposed to be done and you
[1:50:21] remember he's not trying to go in to be
[1:50:23] a communist satan hasn't he's an
[1:50:25] antichrist so close that jesus said
[1:50:26] would deceive
[1:50:28] the very elected remember
[1:50:31] this white horse is not trying to
[1:50:33] deceive the pentecostal church
[1:50:35] they're already deceived this antichrist
[1:50:38] spirit is trying to deceive
[1:50:40] you trying to deceive me
[1:50:46] firstly it says that's the white horse
[1:50:48] rider the way of white
[1:50:50] righteousness church but an antichrist
[1:50:52] it got to look
[1:50:54] like on a horse even just like christ
[1:50:57] coming on a horse
[1:50:58] see friends has got to look good it
[1:51:00] can't look bad to be deceptive it's got
[1:51:02] to look good
[1:51:03] it's got to look okay and it's got to
[1:51:06] look christian
[1:51:09] but christian by title does not mean it
[1:51:11] doesn't come from the false vine
[1:51:13] it doesn't mean it's not polluted with
[1:51:15] hybrid seed and hybrid thought
[1:51:17] it has to be christian we don't want
[1:51:19] christian by appearance
[1:51:22] we want christian by birth by pure word
[1:51:24] by pure life
[1:51:27] christ is coming on a horse and close so
[1:51:30] close to see the very left
[1:51:31] here he is he's the antichrist he
[1:51:33] started writing in the first age
[1:51:34] now he rides on down on down through
[1:51:36] every age watch him
[1:51:39] but there was another anointing that was
[1:51:42] sent
[1:51:43] different from the antichrist anointing
[1:51:45] and this was the anointing from christ
[1:51:47] yes
[1:51:48] and the physio says now as the
[1:51:49] antichrist went forth on a beast of
[1:51:51] ministry there
[1:51:52] god went forth a beast to combat it
[1:51:55] oh who wants to combat the white horse
[1:51:57] this morning
[1:51:58] we realize i've let him in i want him
[1:52:00] out i i've been deceived i don't want to
[1:52:02] be deceived anymore
[1:52:04] he's been knocking at my door he's been
[1:52:06] inching his way in
[1:52:07] but i'm finished with him then what you
[1:52:10] need is a good dose of the lion
[1:52:11] anointing
[1:52:13] when every time the beast rode on a
[1:52:14] horse the antichrist rode his horse on
[1:52:16] this beast
[1:52:17] to announce his ministry god sent his
[1:52:19] beast also in his own mass to announce
[1:52:21] his combat to it
[1:52:23] now the scripture says when the enemy
[1:52:25] comes in like a flood the spirit of god
[1:52:26] raises a standard against it and so
[1:52:28] when the enemy went out as an antichrist
[1:52:30] god sent a certain type of power out to
[1:52:32] meet him
[1:52:34] when he went out again as a red horse
[1:52:35] rider another color another power
[1:52:37] another ministry
[1:52:38] god sent another one after him to combat
[1:52:40] it to hold his church
[1:52:42] sent the third one again god sent his
[1:52:44] third beast to come and announce it
[1:52:46] he sent the fourth one remember now when
[1:52:48] the enemy comes in like a flood god
[1:52:50] raises up a standard
[1:52:51] that doesn't mean that the enemy will
[1:52:53] never come to you like a flood
[1:52:55] it doesn't mean that you will never be
[1:52:56] tempted by the white horse again
[1:52:58] but god will raise a standard against
[1:53:00] the white horse
[1:53:03] hallelujah that's the one i like
[1:53:07] i'm tired of talking about that white
[1:53:08] horse let's talk about the lion
[1:53:12] question and answers on the seals in the
[1:53:13] days of paul the angel the church of
[1:53:15] ephesus paul founded the church
[1:53:17] being the messenger to it remember paul
[1:53:20] founded the church at ephesus
[1:53:22] become the messenger to that church and
[1:53:24] the spirit was in the land at that time
[1:53:25] was a lion spirit
[1:53:27] and the lion is the lion of the tribe of
[1:53:29] judah which is christ and christ is the
[1:53:31] word
[1:53:32] paul with the word of that age so what
[1:53:35] is the lion anointing it's christ
[1:53:37] the word
[1:53:40] what has returned in this day the word
[1:53:44] in measure or in fullness and fullness
[1:53:47] so do we have a line anointing oh we can
[1:53:50] combat the white horse rider with the
[1:53:51] lion anointing
[1:53:52] because we have thus saith the lord on
[1:53:54] the scriptures
[1:53:55] we have the what was in the back part of
[1:53:57] the mind of god has been revealed
[1:53:59] through a prophet
[1:54:00] we know what the word means we know how
[1:54:01] he wants us to line up to it
[1:54:03] we know what the holiness standard is by
[1:54:04] the scripture not because we figured it
[1:54:06] out or reasoned it but because we've had
[1:54:08] a divine
[1:54:09] interpreter of the word on the scene who
[1:54:11] will point us back to the pure meaning
[1:54:13] of the pure word the same as paul taught
[1:54:15] it
[1:54:17] and we can take that same pure word and
[1:54:20] we can roar like a lion and remember the
[1:54:22] white horse has no
[1:54:24] crown he has no arrows
[1:54:27] he can't do anything to you
[1:54:31] until you let him in and put a crown on
[1:54:33] his head
[1:54:35] so what do you do when the white horse
[1:54:36] knocks on your door
[1:54:38] you roar like a lion
[1:54:42] what is the roar of the lion the pure
[1:54:45] word
[1:54:47] christ the word
[1:54:50] doth not the word say see jesus was
[1:54:54] tempted in the wilderness and the
[1:54:56] antichrist spirit came to him too
[1:54:59] he was led of the holy ghost into the
[1:55:00] wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[1:55:02] and he left us an example and every time
[1:55:06] that the devil would come in temptation
[1:55:08] he was bringing the word
[1:55:11] the devil came with reasoning on the
[1:55:14] word
[1:55:16] doth not the scripture say that you dash
[1:55:18] thy foot against the stool he'll lift
[1:55:19] thee up
[1:55:19] cast thyself down he's quoting the
[1:55:22] scriptures
[1:55:23] but he's adding reasoning to it
[1:55:26] he says then and jesus said doth not the
[1:55:30] scriptures say
[1:55:33] what did he do he took the revelation of
[1:55:35] the word in its proper place
[1:55:38] the devil brought the word but he
[1:55:40] misplaced it
[1:55:41] somebody might bring you a quote that
[1:55:43] shows you certain activities are okay
[1:55:45] they can misplace it the white horse
[1:55:48] uses quotes
[1:55:50] if you use the word with jesus would he
[1:55:52] not use the message against you
[1:55:55] absolutely but you've got to catch his
[1:55:57] cunning deception
[1:55:59] he's trying to get a quote and he's
[1:56:01] pulling it out i mean
[1:56:02] there may be a hundred quotes that say
[1:56:04] it straight one way and one quote that
[1:56:06] kind of could mean this way
[1:56:07] which quote do you think he's going to
[1:56:08] show you
[1:56:12] oh he's a deceiver but we're not going
[1:56:15] to be the seed because we're going to
[1:56:17] take the word
[1:56:18] the whole word we're going to be
[1:56:20] listening to tapes reading books
[1:56:22] being in fellowship we're going to be so
[1:56:24] full of the pure word
[1:56:25] that when the devil comes anything
[1:56:27] contrary to that will roar like a lion
[1:56:28] and say
[1:56:29] that's not what the prophet said that's
[1:56:31] not what the scriptures say
[1:56:33] hallelujah if you come to jesus with the
[1:56:36] word he'll try to come to you with the
[1:56:37] word
[1:56:39] if he tried to misrepresent the
[1:56:40] scriptures and use reasoning
[1:56:42] he'll do the same thing with the
[1:56:43] scriptures he'll do the same thing with
[1:56:44] the quotes
[1:56:46] don't think that he won't he absolutely
[1:56:49] will
[1:56:52] the lion of spirit in the sixth seal he
[1:56:55] says now
[1:56:56] see if you can get back here under the
[1:56:58] seals it
[1:56:59] when they're opened you can see exactly
[1:57:01] what god is doing what he has done
[1:57:03] what he is going to do here it is
[1:57:04] exactly and that's the reason men
[1:57:06] acts that way because that spirit that's
[1:57:08] predicted for that age to be on them
[1:57:11] they couldn't do nothing else john paul
[1:57:13] in them the lion spirit
[1:57:15] the word itself the word itself is a
[1:57:19] lion spirit
[1:57:20] and when the enemy comes in as a white
[1:57:22] horse you can take the pure word
[1:57:26] and you can cast him out
[1:57:30] the lion is the pure word which is
[1:57:32] christ which is paul's teaching
[1:57:35] brother branham brought us back to the
[1:57:37] original faith of the pentecostal
[1:57:39] fathers
[1:57:41] amen brother branham told us that the
[1:57:44] book of acts
[1:57:45] was not the framework for the christian
[1:57:48] church
[1:57:49] the book of acts was the measure by
[1:57:51] which
[1:57:52] every church should attain to
[1:57:55] it wasn't it was the example church it
[1:57:59] was not the framework
[1:58:01] and that's why we had to be restored
[1:58:03] back to that truth
[1:58:04] and back to that faith you know what
[1:58:06] will corrupt that faith
[1:58:08] compromise deviation from the truth
[1:58:12] accepting the white horse will
[1:58:14] absolutely
[1:58:15] destroy what god has tried to do in this
[1:58:17] age
[1:58:18] so in the battle plan when lucifer comes
[1:58:20] in with compromise
[1:58:22] deviation from the word we go right back
[1:58:25] to the pure word we do exactly what
[1:58:26] jesus did
[1:58:27] when he was tempted in the wilderness
[1:58:29] he'll come in and he'll say well what
[1:58:30] about this
[1:58:31] or what about that or don't you think or
[1:58:33] you know this isn't the same kind of
[1:58:35] time
[1:58:35] things have changed you go right back
[1:58:37] with god said
[1:58:38] the prophet said god vindicated it he
[1:58:41] backed it up
[1:58:43] i believe it and i'm going to measure up
[1:58:45] to the message of the hour
[1:58:48] i'm gonna measure up to the word that's
[1:58:50] been restored
[1:58:51] and if you do that he'll never have a
[1:58:53] crown and he'll never have no arrows and
[1:58:55] he has no authority whatsoever over you
[1:58:58] he can't hurt you he's an absolute bluff
[1:59:01] and he has zero
[1:59:02] authority don't let him in
[1:59:05] and don't put a crown on his head you
[1:59:07] take the word that god has restored
[1:59:10] and you throw the word back in his face
[1:59:12] and if you resist the devil the devil
[1:59:13] will
[1:59:15] flee let's all stand
[1:59:18] musicians if you could come
[1:59:22] there's a lot that i didn't read
[1:59:26] and we might get to it maybe on
[1:59:28] wednesday i don't know
[1:59:29] just pray we want to see the devil's
[1:59:33] full tactics exposed all the way through
[1:59:36] and we want to find out how god combats
[1:59:39] it we want to find out what anointing
[1:59:42] you find out today that you've allowed a
[1:59:43] white horse you say god
[1:59:45] give me more of your word put it in my
[1:59:48] mind
[1:59:49] put it in my heart wash me by the water
[1:59:52] of the word
[1:59:52] and give me the power to resist
[1:59:55] compromise
[1:59:56] brother branham says in the church age
[1:59:58] book when he's speaking in the ephesian
[1:59:59] church age
[2:00:00] he said the very name ephesus has a
[2:00:03] strange compound meaning
[2:00:05] it means aimed at and relaxed
[2:00:10] remember your first love remember your
[2:00:13] legalistic face how many of us
[2:00:16] aimed at and then relaxed
[2:00:20] how many of us went through ephesus i'd
[2:00:23] venture to say all of us have went
[2:00:24] through ephesus
[2:00:26] i've been through ephesus you've been
[2:00:27] through ephesus aim that
[2:00:30] and relaxed but god hasn't called us to
[2:00:34] aim at and relaxed
[2:00:35] he's called us to press towards the mark
[2:00:37] of the high calling in christ jesus
[2:00:40] he's told us to grow into the head in
[2:00:42] all things which is christ
[2:00:43] he's supposed to grow in the knowledge
[2:00:45] and understanding of our lord jesus
[2:00:46] christ he's told us to keep
[2:00:48] going forward we've never been told to
[2:00:51] relax
[2:00:52] yes aimed at and relaxed
[2:00:55] the high aspirations of this age that
[2:00:57] had begun with the fullness of the
[2:00:58] spirit the depth of god
[2:01:00] whereby they were aiming at the high
[2:01:02] calling of god began to give way to a
[2:01:04] less
[2:01:04] watchful attitude i say oh god
[2:01:08] that was me i went through ephesus
[2:01:13] a less watchful attitude a less ardent
[2:01:16] following of jesus christ
[2:01:17] began to manifest manifest itself as an
[2:01:20] omen that in the future ages the
[2:01:22] physical vehicle called the church
[2:01:24] would sink to the awfulness of the depth
[2:01:27] of satan
[2:01:28] it had become relaxed and was now
[2:01:31] drifting
[2:01:33] he says further in the church age book
[2:01:35] about ephesus he says the fervent desire
[2:01:37] to please god the passion to know his
[2:01:40] word
[2:01:41] the cry for reaching out in the spirit
[2:01:44] all begins to fade
[2:01:46] oh brothers and sisters that washes me
[2:01:48] right out
[2:01:50] that strips me down and says god i'm
[2:01:53] sorry
[2:01:55] this is why i've been repenting this is
[2:01:57] why i've been crying out to the lord
[2:01:58] this is why i've been rising early this
[2:02:01] is why i'm reading my
[2:02:02] the message around the clock because i
[2:02:04] found that ephesus came to me
[2:02:08] aimed at and relaxed i allowed somebody
[2:02:11] to convince
[2:02:12] me that i should grow out of my
[2:02:13] legalistic face
[2:02:16] remember legalism is not obeying the
[2:02:19] word
[2:02:21] fully obeying the word is not legalism
[2:02:24] legalism is believing that somehow by
[2:02:27] obeying the word god will accept you
[2:02:29] and save you and fill you with the
[2:02:31] spirit
[2:02:34] even though he gives the spirit to them
[2:02:35] that obey him
[2:02:38] see obedience is required it is mandated
[2:02:41] and disobedience has never been accepted
[2:02:43] in the bible ever
[2:02:45] he has always expected full obedience
[2:02:49] any time there was not full obedience
[2:02:51] and god doesn't call obedience legalism
[2:02:54] legalism is believing that you can do
[2:02:56] something to put yourself into grace
[2:02:58] that's legalism are doing something to
[2:03:01] gain extra favor with god
[2:03:03] outside of his grace that's legalism
[2:03:06] fully obeying the word
[2:03:08] is not legalism and i failed when i let
[2:03:11] somebody convince me that i needed to
[2:03:13] mature out of my legalistic
[2:03:15] phase oh my goodness i should have
[2:03:17] matured in my legalistic phase
[2:03:19] not legalism but full obedience
[2:03:23] a desire a passionate desire to keep his
[2:03:25] word
[2:03:26] a passionate desire to reach out in the
[2:03:28] spirit and keep reaching out and keep
[2:03:30] getting hold
[2:03:31] and getting rapturing revelation after
[2:03:33] rapturing revelation after rapturing
[2:03:35] revelation
[2:03:36] but somebody convinced me to relax
[2:03:39] and that's where i made my mistake
[2:03:46] that cry for reaching out in the spirit
[2:03:48] all begins to fade
[2:03:49] instead of the church being on fire with
[2:03:52] the fire of god it has cooled off and
[2:03:54] become a bit formal
[2:03:56] that is what has happened back there in
[2:03:58] the ephesians
[2:03:59] they were getting a bit formal the
[2:04:01] abandonment to god was dying out and the
[2:04:03] people weren't too careful about what
[2:04:05] god thought of them
[2:04:06] as they began to be careful about what
[2:04:08] the world thought of them
[2:04:10] you know what we might as well forget
[2:04:12] that now because we're getting ready to
[2:04:13] leave the world
[2:04:14] i don't care what they think anymore if
[2:04:16] i care about what they think i'll stay
[2:04:17] with them and i don't want to stay with
[2:04:18] them i want to leave
[2:04:20] it's time we forget about what the world
[2:04:22] thinks and start caring what god thinks
[2:04:25] that is the history of the church when
[2:04:27] it thinks more of conforming to the
[2:04:28] world instead of conforming to god
[2:04:30] it isn't long until you see them stop
[2:04:32] doing things they used to do
[2:04:34] and start doing things they wouldn't do
[2:04:36] initially
[2:04:38] they changed their manner of dress their
[2:04:40] attitudes their behavior
[2:04:41] they got lacks that is what ephesus
[2:04:43] means relaxed
[2:04:45] drifting it's time to come back
[2:04:50] by the anointing of the pure word with
[2:04:53] christ
[2:04:54] and say god i want that burning hot
[2:04:56] desire
[2:04:57] i want to come back to my first love
[2:05:00] when everything else
[2:05:01] would hit the garbage can and i was a
[2:05:03] joy to see it go
[2:05:05] i wasn't going oh
[2:05:09] my favorite movie oh oh
[2:05:12] brothers and sisters remember the day
[2:05:14] when it was
[2:05:15] get it out of my life i want something
[2:05:18] different than what i've had
[2:05:19] i want something different than the way
[2:05:20] i've grown up i wanted something
[2:05:22] different in this world
[2:05:23] i want a real genuine god i want a real
[2:05:26] genuine faith and i want a real genuine
[2:05:28] holy ghost
[2:05:32] hallelujah
[2:05:34] it says in ephesians now it does not
[2:05:36] mean that she could not have repented
[2:05:38] it does not mean that we cannot repent
[2:05:41] we can
[2:05:42] but we must be quickly it must be a true
[2:05:45] heart to cry out to god in sorrow
[2:05:46] and then god will restore
[2:05:50] the glory shall come again
[2:05:54] how many wants the glory to come again
[2:05:58] praying because you loved him not
[2:05:59] because you had to
[2:06:01] praying because you were connecting with
[2:06:03] a supernatural being
[2:06:04] not because to be a good christian you
[2:06:06] have to pray and read your bible every
[2:06:07] day
[2:06:08] reading the word because it was feeding
[2:06:10] your soul not because it was a chore
[2:06:11] that christians must do
[2:06:13] listening to the message because you
[2:06:14] have a fervent desire what took on all
[2:06:17] the way
[2:06:17] it wasn't that the message changed it
[2:06:19] wasn't that the bible changed
[2:06:21] amen it wasn't like we get lied to all
[2:06:23] the time amen and say that just was what
[2:06:25] happens it doesn't have to happen
[2:06:27] what happens is compromise comes in and
[2:06:30] compromise comes in
[2:06:31] and when compromise comes in it breaks
[2:06:33] your fellowship with god
[2:06:35] to deviate on one word brother brahm
[2:06:37] said we'll break your fellowship with
[2:06:39] god
[2:06:40] and what happened to us we thought that
[2:06:42] it just kind of got to a dry period
[2:06:44] go check your life and see if you
[2:06:45] haven't done something to break your
[2:06:46] fellowship with god
[2:06:49] come back to our first love a fervent
[2:06:52] desire for everything godly
[2:06:55] a fervent fire a need to have more of a
[2:06:58] spirit
[2:06:59] more of his fellowship more of his word
[2:07:01] a burning
[2:07:02] hot desire for more of god less of me
[2:07:05] less of the world and more of him that's
[2:07:07] how we overcome the antichrist spirit
[2:07:10] come back to the pureness of the word
[2:07:12] come back to the full restoration of the
[2:07:14] word which is christ
[2:07:15] and have nothing but that oh brothers
[2:07:18] and sisters
[2:07:19] we never matured when we moved away from
[2:07:22] our first love
[2:07:23] we began to die but maturity
[2:07:27] is coming back to our first love
[2:07:30] let's all bow our heads
[2:07:33] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[2:07:35] for this day
[2:07:37] god when you when you preached the seals
[2:07:40] you opened up
[2:07:41] the plan of lucifer not just what he
[2:07:45] would do for church ages but what he's
[2:07:46] trying to do today
[2:07:49] in god he has been exposed in this place
[2:07:51] today
[2:07:53] his tactics have been exposed he has
[2:07:55] been unfolded and uncovered
[2:07:58] and satan as a body we want to tell you
[2:08:00] we deny you now in the name of jesus
[2:08:02] christ
[2:08:03] you may have attempted to deceive you
[2:08:05] may have brought in distractions
[2:08:07] but we're serving you notice right now
[2:08:08] that you must go
[2:08:10] we're pleading the pure word that's been
[2:08:12] restored to us through the message of
[2:08:14] the hour
[2:08:15] we believe that we're lining up to it
[2:08:17] it's true everything else you say is a
[2:08:19] lie
[2:08:19] we deny you we resist you in the name of
[2:08:21] jesus christ now be gone from us

[2:08:26] these people

[2:08:32] repent they go back to their first love

[2:10:00] where we were fed our souls were so
[2:10:02] enlightened by your word

[2:13:00] change my heart oh god
[2:13:06] may i be like
[2:13:09] [Music]
[2:13:14] praise the lord you know
[2:13:19] jesus demonstrated how to overcome
[2:13:22] he lived a life and he did only that
[2:13:26] which his father showed him only that
[2:13:30] david was a man after god's own heart
[2:13:31] that would do all
[2:13:33] my will the scripture says
[2:13:36] that's the heart i want to do all his
[2:13:38] will not my will his will
[2:13:40] i want to die and jesus demonstrated
[2:13:43] death to us like nobody else ever has
[2:13:46] sacrificing himself sacrificing his will
[2:13:50] you know it came to me one time i was
[2:13:52] studying and i realized
[2:13:54] jesus never died at calvary
[2:13:58] jesus died at gethsemane
[2:14:00] [Music]
[2:14:02] the only reason he could go to calvary
[2:14:04] is because he first died at gethsemane
[2:14:07] he asked lord if it be possible
[2:14:10] let this cup pass from me jesus wasn't
[2:14:14] running to the cross because he thought
[2:14:16] it was a neat idea he didn't run there
[2:14:18] because he thought it sounded like
[2:14:19] fun he was wrestling within his own
[2:14:22] humanity
[2:14:24] asking if there was any way let this cup
[2:14:26] pass from me
[2:14:28] and when it came back that it was no
[2:14:29] other way
[2:14:31] he went right back to be it unto me
[2:14:33] according to thy will
[2:14:36] jesus died at gethsemane
[2:14:39] and he could go to calvary when he was
[2:14:42] being beaten
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:44] they were beating a dead man
[2:14:48] when they were questioning him before
[2:14:49] pilate they were questioning a dead man
[2:14:52] when they were nailing him to the cross
[2:14:54] they were nailing a dead man to the
[2:14:56] cross
[2:14:56] because he had already died at
[2:14:58] gethsemane
[2:15:00] and i say god let this be my gethsemane
[2:15:04] let me die right now lord
[2:15:07] let me die every day lord let every
[2:15:09] morning be gethsemane for me
[2:15:11] that i will quit with the world and i
[2:15:13] will quit with with hobbies and i will
[2:15:16] quit with other passions
[2:15:17] but there'll be no passion like this
[2:15:19] passion there'll be no desire like this
[2:15:22] desire
[2:15:23] let me die to let this be my gethsemane
[2:15:26] lord
[2:15:27] and let me go as a sacrifice vessel to
[2:15:30] you
[2:15:31] completely surrendered not my life but
[2:15:34] your life the believer has to come to
[2:15:37] gethsemane friends
[2:15:38] we've got to continually come back to
[2:15:40] gethsemane
[2:15:42] say purge me lord let me die
[2:15:45] our lord was our example he showed us
[2:15:47] what to do
[2:15:48] and we have to do likewise god bless you
[2:15:51] we love you
[2:15:53] we're going to let you be dismissed

[2:16:41] horse becomes the red horse becomes the
[2:16:43] black horse he won't let you go that way

[2:16:51] senses and realize i'm not doing right
[2:16:55] why that's love brothers and sisters
