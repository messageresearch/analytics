and have your as we [Music] we pray speak your word into our hearts and have your ways [Music] have your way [Music] as we wait as we pray speak your [Music] [Music] amen is that what we want to have his way above all that's what we desire israel to have his way to push away the human side to push away that side that's still flawed and take control amen that's the desire of our hearts while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn into revelation chapter 10. we're going to pick up there again while you're standing before we get to the scripture reading i have another exciting announcement to make we've got a picture to put up on the overhead here but peter and sarah kusukika just had another little baby girl she was born yesterday june 30th at 12 30 and her name is nazarene kusukica praise the lord we want to thank god for her for a safe and healthy delivery they're doing well mr sarah should be home in a day or two and then they'll heal up there and who knows how long before they're able to make it over here but hopefully we get to see her pretty soon so god has been good amen also i want to make an announcement real quick that this sunday is the first sunday in july and we're going to have a communion service there'll be a second service for communion and that the fellowship hall and the pavilion will be open if you want to bring something to eat and stay here on the grounds and eat in between and then we'll come back for the second service this coming sunday also i just heard i just got an update that brother ron peterson was released from the hospital he's home recovering so thank god for that amen thank you lord we appreciate the lord he's so good and he's so faithful to keep and honor his word amen amen let's just read while we're standing now revelation 10 verse 7 but in the day in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god in the altar and them that worshiped therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months amen let's just bow our heads the heavenly father we ask you lord jesus the lord just bless the reading of your word not just this scripture but all the scriptures and the quotes included lord that it would be more than just a service just a man reading scripture and exhorting upon it lord but there would be something supernatural taking place for this is the method that you chose to preach the gospel and we come to honor that and submit ourselves to it lord we pray lord that you would take absolute control and speak your words we pray god that you would hear lord through our hearts that we would receive your word lord and we can grow to the image of what you want from us in this day that we might be pleasing unto you in all things take your word lord and help us to grow lord by it in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all take your seats amen i want to continue on with the thought that i've been on for several services on do not fear his voice this will be part four i really believed when i started doing this that i was just going to do a little bit of review and go back to a bit of a foundation that we've had over the last couple years and i really believe that i would hit this in one service kind of hit a few of these types and move on and it didn't work out that way amen and so god is just he keeps opening things up and we like it that way and he's had control and and then this uh past sunday was just such a unique service all that were here aware of that and god just took absolute control and and did things that we never anticipated and spoke things that we never thought about and i just want to say i thank him for that amen and so we're going to get back i feel comfortable going in the same direction and so we're going to continue on with do not fear his voice this will be part four and we're going to just keep in the same vein of thought and if the lord will allow us just keep going back to that those points that we've talked about these are these are not brand new things these are not things we've never heard or never discussed but we want to just touch on those points i just feel to touch them again through the old testament and show you know what's taking place here in revelations 10 verse eight this transition that's taking place from the seventh church age messenger now to john taking the book and eating the book and prophesying again this is a transition that's been foreshadowed all through the old testament amen there's so many types that'll bring us to our day and show us that his voice is in her and we know that we live in the day when his voice will be in her and that she will be him this is the day when the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word so so we live in the day where the the bride will be the final voice to the final age and his voice will be in her and all of these things that we've talked about but we can see this isn't just a concept that brother branham god or something he just thought of it's been laying in the old testament it's been all through the bible amen and once once god opens our eyes to see when a prophet brings it to the surface and and you see that concept and you see it here in the scriptures in revelation chapter 10 then all of a sudden when you go back with your eyes open you see it here and here and here and here and it's and it's all over the place so we would like to go by the grace of god and touch a few of those points and just bring them in to this to just reinforce the foundation the lord's given us to keep moving higher i want to go back and read the quote that i tried to get through on sunday but i only read through half of this quote it's amazing brother franco takes my notes and he puts them on the um uh the archives because people like going through the notes and and and he said you have any notes for sunday i said no notes i just don't have any i mean i come with eight pages of notes and i use none i read the first scripture which is the one we just read and i got halfway through this first quote and then we were gone from there and there was there was no notes so praise god there's no notes and that's the way we like it because god is we want god to operate his gift the way he chooses to operate it not the way we're accustomed to or even what we would consider traditional we want god to take control but let's go to this quote and things that are to be from 1965 brother brahms in the last couple of weeks of his ministry here in december he says now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride now brother brahma is saying we said sunday he's saying a mouthful here we cannot live by denominationalism that won't work my creed that's not going to work but there's only one thing that we can live by is because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband so the the the going all the way back to the beginning with adam the son of god in the garden of eden amen his wife was part of him and so that's always the pattern once the pattern starts that's the pattern that's the original that's what god wants because out of god came the word amen and when that word came out of god in the beginning if you go all the way back to the proverbs that word is referred to in the feminist and the feminist expression because that which comes out of the mail is the feminist the female amen and so the word is in the feminist form all the way back in proverbs and the word is called wisdom and wisdom is her name and wisdom is a female amen and and and and the way it's denoted there so you have male and female and then you go to the garden of eden you have male and female and adam's wife was part of him and the bride is part of christ brother brown goes all the way back to calvary and says he was he was they struck that blow in his side and out come the ingredients for the bride and all of these things because she was in him there on calvary she's come out of him she is part of him forever was part forever will be part of him so because she's part of him and he's the word that makes her word also and now she can't live by anything else but the original word with the true revelation and true intent of the word that's what she must live on because that's her origin that's what she is and i would say this way that is the the preaching of that word by revelation to her individually is what is awakening her to why are she where she was before the foundation of the world who she actually is amen spiritual amnesia is stripping away by the revelation of the word in this hour and brother ben says therefore we must be that word bride there's no other options there's a there's another option to be the bride in this day you must be that word bride amen it's going to be a full expression of the word again and he says now and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour see when we come to this hour we're not worried about any other hours it doesn't matter we can pass the test on the manifestation of another hour it doesn't matter that we can write phd papers on the manifestation of other hours amen that won't do us any good we have to understand and be the manifestation in this hour the hour that we're living the junction in time that we're at and we have to know where we are amen and the great sequence of events and the placing in god's mind we have to know our position and know our place amen because we can never have a proper identity and a proper position if we don't know the hour that we're living in because we were born for an hour and this hour was designed for us and they matched together and there's been a word unfolded to unlock the mystery that's inside the children of god that are born for the manifestation of this hour so so we must we must have the word for this hour and we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living amen you know what that means if i could just put it a bluntly but but as kind as i know how it has to be a living oracle of god a living attribute of god alive in this dimension in this time realm amen in this date on the calendar a living oracle of god not a previous living oracle of god but a present day living oracle god living attribute of god so that's why hanging our hat on a previous living oracle is not going to do any good because now we have to be the living oracle the living attributes that's why stopping amen stopping in the prophet's ministry and hanging out just in the prophet's ministry amen and saying he was a living oracle of god he was the living attribute of god and that is an absolute true statement for the hour in which he was alive upon this earth but but god has used that manifestation and he's taken that vessel onto a reward and now there's vessels on the earth that have to be the living manifestation the living oracles the living attributes of god amen and what what will wake up that bride it's the ministry that god brought through that prophet god i mean it was the ministry of jesus christ but the ministry of jesus christ came through a vessel and that vessel was william branham who was the seventh church age messenger prophesied to come he was here he did his part and his part was to be play the role of eleazar amen to bring bride to isaac and see the two connected together and he faithfully fulfilled his role to be the living word for his day and now we have to be faithful to our part to be the living word for our day amen so so it's the living oracle of god that's what the word bride is a living oracle of god living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living so we have moved from church to bride we made that transition and brother bennett made sure it was clear in the first seal he said i no longer call you church i call you bride so that you understand so that you know that during this seals there's a transition taking place we're moving from church to bride and if we move from church to bride then the bride must move from church ages to bride age they go together those transitions and so now i want to go back and i want to pick up a story in the old testament if we can go to first kings together first kings 18 and just look at a few things together we've been through this thoroughly so we're just going to touch on it and and draw some pieces out and then move on but let's go to the elijah ministry in first kings 18 because the elijah ministry laid a pattern set a foundation which every elijah ministry after that's gonna gonna gonna show forth so first kings 18 and verse 30. this is on mount carmel it says and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down so when we see the elijah ministry coming to mount the mount carmel showdown he is now going to be beginning to deal with hybrid religion because he's not just dealing with jews who have turned their back on jehovah he's dealing on people that are mixing their worship because he says if baal be god serve him if jehovah begot serve him that you're going to have to pick you can no longer blend paganism with christianity you can no longer blend amen a three god worship with the worship of the god of the bible now on mount carmel elijah's coming to to say you've got we've got to separate these two things out you either choose baal or you choose jehovah but you can't have it both ways anymore so we see the elijah ministry in order to do that he has to repair the altar he's not bringing in a new one he's repairing the one that's there amen and brother ben he didn't bring a new word amen he was to restore the word that was lost through paul and then reveal the mysteries that laid under the seven thunders all right so first he repairs the altar he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice i just want to draw a little truth out of there at the time of the evening sacrifice you know when when moses instituted the temple worship to the children of israel they were told every day to offer two lambs one in the morning and one in the evening showing that there's going to be a lamb in the morning and a lamb in the evening because when you come to the church ages now jesus christ was the lamb that was offered in the morning and jesus christ the word is the lamb that's offered in the evening so now it comes to the time of the evening sacrifice showing that elijah is going to come to the showdown amen to separate paganism and christianity amen win at the time of the evening sacrifice at the setting of the sun and will be light at the evening time at the end of the church ages at the end of the later season church age all these things are telling us the same story over and over and over again that's why when we read through the bible when we separate out little stories and and we don't make them tell one story we begin to miss so much of what's going on in the bible but actually all the scripture is pointing to this day all the scripture is pointing to this day and when we read the word we just say god open it to me amen you can't we can't force anything neither do we want to cram pieces in places that they don't fit but once we have our eyes open and we realize what we're going what's going on all around us amen what is happening then we go back to the word and it's laying there it's just laying there you don't put it there it's just there so now he comes at the time of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said to the lord to the said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again does anybody remember malachi 4 what's he supposed to do turn their heart back so now we have elijah amen he's setting the stage for what will come in the future and now he comes at the time of the evening sacrifice he comes to a showdown between mixed hybrid religion and he's going to restore him he's going to restore the people of god back to the original worship to the original altar he's going to build it back with 12 stones he's repairing the altar what's he doing he's bringing them back to the original at the time of the evening sacrifice and he's saying lord you're turning their hearts back showing that this is the elijah ministry that's going to come again to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers it's beautiful so we see elijah very much this is the same ministry of malachi 4 very much the same spirit so we can see that very easy brother branham is going to do the same thing amen he's going to repair the proper place of worship the only provided place of worship he's going to bring it back and then he's going to repair the altar that was torn down he's going to bring back the gospel of paul that was lost through the church ages he's going to come at the time of the evening sacrifice amen he's even going to preach indictment showing that the lamb had been slain in the evening time amen and he's doing that to turn the hearts back but we know in his ministry that he's also commissioned to do three things before he leaves one of them is to anoint elisha to be prophet in his place anoint jehu to be king and an anoint hezel to be king of syria he's supposed to do these three things but we know in his lifetime that he only accomplishes one and that's when he anoints elisha a meant to be to be prophet in his place by throwing the mantle over him and all of those things so i'm just going through this quickly because we've been through it before but in the message trying to do god a service without it being god's will the prophet of god says now he promised that so that sets the bible just exactly to this day and the sodom and gomorrah elijah was not that wasn't elijah that was the spirit of god on elijah elijah was just a man now we've had elijahs and elijah's coats and elijah's mantles and elijah's everything but the elijah of this day is the lord jesus christ i say that for a reason so that we know what was that spirit working in brother branham it was a son of man revealing the son of man that spirit of elijah in our day was none other than the lord jesus christ right and he was working through the form of elijah amen through a prophet amen but it was none other than the lord jesus christ so he said but the elijah of this day is the lord jesus christ he is to come according to matthew the luke 17 30 it says the son of man is to reveal himself among his people not a man but god but it'll come through a prophet so now brother man is really he's really separating things out he's removing his flesh from the equation and he's saying the real elijah that's to come this luke 17 30 all these prophecies amen and he's even tying it to malachi 4 because he says the elijah that's to come amen he says really it's the lord jesus christ but it'll come through a prophet so he's going to use a vessel so we know that the the elijah spirit in our day is the lord jesus christ that's important to note then we get into it is the rising of the sun from 65 he says the same quickening power of god presented in both these prophets look at their names are almost the same elisha elijah see the bride and the groom one of them is mr jesus the other one is mrs jesus you see almost the same just between the he and she so brother branham is showing us he's using this type to show that there's a resurrection and a rapture but he's taking us and showing us elijah and elisha are almost the same name just the difference between he and she he and she bride and bridegroom and i'm going to ask if the elijah spirit of this day was none other than the lord jesus christ then what is the elisha spirit of this day it's the lord jesus christ only difference is between he and she he and she amen so let's turn to second kings second kings chapter two now when we get into when we get into second kings oh i don't know how i want to do this i think brother frank if you could get this white board up i want to write something on the white board here in just a second but when we go into second kings chapter two uh it's time for elijah is going to leave and he and he keeps trying to get elisha to stay where he's at so he's going to move from gilgal and he's going to move to bethel then down to jericho and then the jordan and each time he tests elisha and he tells elisha you know you stay here and elijah said as the lord lives and my soul lives i'll not leave thee and so elijah's refusing and he's traveling he's traveling this road with elijah step and step and he won't leave elijah anywhere if elijah's moving on elisha's moving on and he's discouraged in every way he's discouraged by elijah himself he's discouraged by the school of the prophets amen everybody's speaking to him discouragement but there's something in elijah that says if elijah goes there i go there too this is really good friends this is really good so we're up so he's going to move through four stages he's going to go from gilgal to bethel to jericho and to jordan and now these four stages are important because brother banham shows us four stages in the wheat plant coming up and he shows us four stages amen to the new birth he shows us justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost but brother brahm doesn't stop at the baptism of holy ghost he said justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made it away for the baptism holy ghost and the baptism holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost himself because brother benham starts showing us that you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell because if he says it's a genuine the genuine holy ghost he's not talking about a fake holy ghost or an imposter spirit but the genuine holy ghost because there's three realms to you your flesh your spirit and then your there's your soul that has the life of god in the inside amen if that baptism holy spirit only falls down low enough to hit your spirit realm then you'll get excited you'll dance you'll shout you'll say amen but if that spirit doesn't go deep enough to quicken to life the sieging of god that's laying there waiting for this word to come and hit it amen then then then he says you can be you can have the baptism holy ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell what's he talking about it's the baptism holy ghost that only hits the spirit realm of a man but not the life in the soul because if there's no life there the holy ghost can come down it can hit the flesh it can hit your spirit but when it hits the soul there's nothing there to quicken there has to be something just like that spirit down in that soul and those two like parts have to make a connection to spring and forth to life so if there's nothing there amen then it doesn't go to the fourth stage so we have justification and so now elijah is leading him elisha through these four stages and in every stage he's saying stop because the lutherans were content to stop the wesleyans were content to stop and the pentecostals were content to stop but god is looking for one that won't stop no matter how many times they're told to stop you stay here stop you stay here amen and then and then all the school of the prophets don't go any further amen do you know elijah's going to be taken away amen you can't walk that road he's walking amen you stay here you stay here you stay here amen but god was testing elisha to see if elijah would go all the way with elijah right and so you the the plant has to go through stalk through tossing through shuck to get back to wheat seed the holy ghost himself the person of the word alive in you so now uh elisha is elijah's making this journey and uh elijah is saying stay here elisha says no if you're going i'm going. if you preach it i believe it if you say it i believe it if you preach it i'll preach it to you amen he's going all the way if elijah went there elisha goes there amen and and now and now elijah's going to come down to jordan and jordan is like a veil amen and the veil has to be rent for him to move across this four stage amen to go and to go into the holy of holies he's got to rent the veil so he takes his mantle which is prophet's office and he takes that mantle and he smacks the water and when he hits the water the veil the it's the word the water of the word there's water over jordan but that the word is veiling is hiding a mystery that's under the water because all the way back in the exodus journey when joshua was leading them through the ex leading them across jordan amen when they went across jordan the waters parted when the priest entered in with the word on their shoulders the waters parted the vale ran and when the veil was rent they walked across on dry land into the into the promised land and he told 12 princes of the tribes of the 12 tribes to gather a stone and each of them took a stone and they piled the stone in in the middle of jordan in the midst of jordan they piled 12 stones and then they piled 12 stones in gilgal the camp of gilgal on the outside of jordan and when they finally got across all the stones are piled they moved across when they moved across the waters covered back over showing that there's some mystery stone stones is a revelation there's mystery stones laying in jordan and it's covered over by the word amen it's there amen but you can't see it but the elijah ministry will come down with a prophetic mantle from the prophetic office take it off and smack that water and rent the veil and walk across because where did joshua place those stones they were hard against jericho they crossed at jericho amen where does elijah come back down and hit the water at jericho the same crossing amen and opens the water amen and and the scripture doesn't say this i'm just they're at the same place there's a mystery laying in the water and i i thought it often in my mind i thought this way elijah's is walking along and elijah's walking along and all of a sudden they see this pyramid of 12 stones what's that do you see that and elijah just keeps walking goes to the other side and gets caught up in a whirlwind of cherry to fire and that mantle falls back on elisha and he says what would you have what would you have i do for you and he says give me a double portion of thy spirit he says you've asked a hard thing but if you see me go if you see me go then you can have that and he stayed with him all the way through the journey crossed the veil all the way through amen the opening of the water the the revelations that were laying in the word all the way through saw him go amen and it's important this is just brother chad but to me it's important that he sees elijah go and knows that elijah's gone because now elisha is not going amen elisha is not going to be waiting for elijah to do something elijah's done all that elijah's going to do so in this transition it's important that elisha sees elijah go and now elisha knows and we're going to read it in the scripture elisha knows that elijah is gone and now god did with elijah what god's going to do with elijah but that mantle fell and brother brahma said elisha picked up that mantle and we know the scripture tells the same thing he goes back to jordan now jordan is in the same condition it was before he crossed it the first time it's there it's covered over water's covering it amen he he's not able to get across in any human way or see the stones that they're laying under the water but he takes the same mantle that elijah was wearing because you realize elisha does not get his own mantle because the bride of jesus christ she does not get her own mantle she has to take elijah's mantle he was the prophet he brought the word he he gave the perfect interpretation the word with divine vindication not her him so she has to take that same mantle not a new mantle that's why the bride can't be preaching something different than what the prophet preached she can't she can't have more she can't have more revelation or different revelation on the scriptures amen because he's the one who broke open the scriptures but she saw him go and now elisha saw elijah go and now it wasn't just a mantle that came back but that spirit came back and with that spirit now in a new vessel now elisha can take that mantle and now elisha can strike the word the word can part amen elisha can go across and now elisha can uncover the 12 mystery stones that are laying there in pyramid form under jordan amen so so now we're seeing amen it's just like he and she just like the elijah of this day is the lord jesus christ amen and that spirit has come back upon the elisha of this day which is the bride and the bride can take that same mantle that the prophet was wearing that prophetic ministry that prophetic ministry on the word and smite that word and open it up and reveal the stones that are laying there you see it wasn't it wasn't that elijah could catch the same spirit and go sit down with the school of the prophets and drink tea and just tell all the stories about when i was with elijah i saw him do this and i saw him do that and i saw him do that right that's what everybody else did with every other prophetic ministry they would sit down and reminisce about did you remember this and you remember that i heard this story and i met a lady one time who's had this encounter and this and that and that and we just drink tea and just talk about what happened but there was something different with elisha he didn't have to just talk about what happened because that spirit came back on him amen and now he had the spirit of elijah was now in him because the the spirit that was in elijah was the lord jesus christ and the lord jesus christ is here and his bride so let's look at second kings chapter 2 verse 9 now and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me brother says in the message the uncertain sound he says when elijah the old prophet represented christ elisha the young prophet followed him across jordan when he come back he had a double portion and the church followed christ at calvary and the mantle of christ fell down with the baptism of the holy ghost and jesus said these things that i do shall you do also and even greater than this shall you do because i go to my father and so brother bram's using the same thing between elijah christ and now christ come back into his church and that's elijah and elisha so he's using that same type in the same way now let's go down to verse 16. [Music] no i'm sorry let's go to verse 14. and he took the mantle of elijah elijah went up in a chariot a fire he took the amanda elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah when he also had smitten in the waters they parted hither and there and elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah does rest on elisha and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him now when what did they see him do that caused them to recognize where that spirit is it wasn't a healing miracle it wasn't i should say it this way it wasn't anything a pentecostal can do because that could just be the pentecostal spirit but where do you ensure that it's the same lord jesus christ that was in elijah is now an elisha how do you know it's the same spirit and not just a pentecostal spirit because he did the thing with the mantle that elijah did he took elijah's mantle and hit the water so he took the tape say man he took the books amen and he took that and he hit the water and when he hit the water amen the water parted amen and all the sudden he could expose those mystery stones that were laying under the water and had been laying there all the way back when they first crossed into israel amen and all the way back when the bible was written they meant when they were crossing in to the first church age amen there were stones that were placed in the book of revelation called seven thunders and you could see that they were placed there but then the water covered them over and nobody could tell what those seven thunders were they were mysteries they men sealed up to the time of the end amen and they were laying there but an elijah ministry in our day was able to take his office of a prophet and take his mantle and strike the water and part it and show us those seven mysteries that have been in the word the whole time just like these 12 stones that have been laying there in the water the whole time and now when when the school of prophets when they saw elisha come down to jordan and hit it with the men on opening up and expose those stones they said the the the spirit of elijah now rests upon elisha so if you want to know where the spirit of the lord jesus christ is in this day it's not i got to be super careful the way i say this it's not just in those that can do what pentecostals can do because you can't take pentecostal babies supernatural things but pentecostals do a lot of supernatural things so this third pool because this vision is the third pull of the baby shoe you can't lace up the baby shoe with the big cord you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things meaning meaning when you come to the third pool this is the true supernatural things and the third pull is the opening of the word the revealing of the mysteries and you can't teach that to pentecostal babies because pentecostal babies can't catch the revelation of the word but they can catch the manifestation of spiritual gifts so i say that not to diminish spiritual gifts spiritual gifts go with it and spiritual gifts should be in the true church of the living god amen all kinds of spiritual gifts they should be there and should be operating but that is not what the prophet the school of the prophet saw to declare that spirit that was in elijah is now on elisha it's when elisha could take that mantle and strike the word and open it up and reveal those stones and himself and so now the bride and the elijah ministries she's got that same spirit amen and now she can take that prophet some man on take those books amen take those quotes and hit the water and the water can open here and open there and open there and show us those mystery stones that are laying in the water that's why it's so important to be preaching the revelation of the word not just manifestations of the spirit but the greatest manifestation of the spirit in this day is being able to take the sword of the king which is the word of the lord and open up the word and see the great mystery that's been in the back part of god's mind for all this time waiting to be revealed at the end time amen so now let's look over here at verse 16. and they said unto him behold now there be thy there be with thy servant fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest per venture the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or unto some valley and he said you shall not send they said now with the school of prophets the same one who said that spirit was in him is now in you but we want to go find him why do you need him when his spirit is in elisha see it's just human thinking human understanding now they want to go get that flesh body again because the flesh body amen it was the vessel that was being used and now they have an affinity an attachment to the flesh body now the spirit that was in that flesh body has now moved into elisha and in elisha they declare by seeing that what he did that that spirit is now in you proving they didn't want the spirit they wanted the flesh body something they could see and hold because if all they wanted was the same spirit of the lord jesus christ that same spirit was now in elisha but they wanted what was previous and so now he says don't go verse 17 and when they urged him until he was ashamed he said sin they sent there for fifty men and they sought three days but found him not and when they came again to him for he tarried at jericho he said unto them did i not say unto you go not i could have saved you guys a lot of time i said don't go you're not going to find anything you're not going to find anything looking through relics you're not going to find anything going back to famous places you're not going to you're not going to find anything amen looking or waiting amen for that vessel for that for that physical body amen because why because elisha knew that that spirit now fell in him and listen remember it's the difference between he and she christ and the bride bridegroom and bride so where are we at today amen that same spirit of the lord jesus christ that was working in the elijah ministry through a prophet to fulfill malachi 4 luke 17 30 amen revelation 10 1-7 it was all fulfilled there amen but that life is still here amen that spirit is still here but where is the spirit i'll tell you where it's at it's in the place it's in the vessel that can take the mantle strike the word part the waters and show the mystery stones laying underneath that's where that spirit is it's in a mini-membered bride globally around the world so now let's go back and look at revelation 22. revelation 22 very very familiar but i just want to lay all these in take our time revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely so so the bride now and the spirit are speaking the same thing so what spirit is this how many spirits do you want one spirit the same spirit that amen the same spirit that was here in flesh of the nazarene the same spirit that was poured out on the day of pentecost the same spirit that was here in the prophet the seventh church age messenger it's the same spirit and now the spirit and the bride say come because the spirit is now speaking through the bride they're in harmony so if we want to hear from the spirit amen brother bam says in the later scene church age right out of the church age book he said once more god will reveal the truth as he did to paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefit beneficent effect of that prophet's ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of the bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come the corn of wheat the bride we that fell into the ground and nicea has come back to original word grain again praise god forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he says from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among her now and be separate so now she's she's now making the same declaration that elijah did on mount carmel in the mount carmel showdown if baal be god serve him if what was what was elijah doing elijah was saying leave separate come back to the original come back to jehovah come back to the repaired altar turn the hearts of the children back amen and now amen the spirit and the prophet and the bride are saying the same thing come amen in order to come you have to leave amen leave and come amen i'm not where you are but you come to where i am because where i am is where the water of life is flowing freely she is with the water of life the water of life is flowing out of her belly isn't that what jesus christ said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water amen the living water is flowing freely amen from her belly because she has the word and as she proclaims the word the fountain of living water is open in this day and she's saying come come come from where you are to here you can't have both it's one or the other we can't have denominationalism and creed and drink from this fountain but we've got to leave all denominationalism and creed and come to the fountain and at the end of the book who is making the call the spirit and the bride where are we in this book are we at the end of the book if we're at the end of the book and this world is going to want to hear hear direct from heaven amen what vessel is he going to use i'm volunteering right now god i'm not fit i'm not worthy but by your blood by the washing of your spirit you can clean this vessel sanctify it by the washing of water the word to make it something fit for you to use but if you've got to have a mouthpiece if you've got that vocal cords if you've got to have a flesh body to manifest the life of jesus christ i'm volunteering this one right now and i'm surrendering myself on the altar and saying consume me god burn up everything that's not like you because there's nobody else on earth that's volunteering for the job but there still has to be a fountain of living water flowing there still has to be a source there still has to be a place there still has to be vocal cords on this earth declaring the word of the lord there's got to be a place for the people of this world and if it's got to be wherever the bride and the spirit are speaking praise be to god let's go to luke chapter one i feel like i'm going off like a scatter gun but i like it i like it i just want to grab several things here if you just hang with me a little bit longer luke chapter one we started into this a few weeks ago but i want to keep going here luke chapter 1 verse 12. when zechariah saw him zechariah we know is performing as priest offices he's he's in the tabernacle and he sees an angel we know that angel's gabriel and gabriel begins to he sees him and he's scared he says when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before them in the spirit and power of elias to turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife while stricken in years and the angel answered and said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believeth not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season so here comes zechariah zacharias is a priest under the priest order he's serving in the temple he knows the word he meets an angel of the lord the angel lord tells him of the ministry of the forerunner that's coming through him and his wife they're old amen then this is typing the old church in the old order he's a righteous man his wife is righteous amen in in the angel speaks to him and he begins to doubt he questions the word of the angel said how shall this be because i'm old my wife is old and and brother branham said he should have never done that being a priest he should have known that god did this before when he brought a child through an elderly couple of abraham and sarah and because god had done it in the word before when it comes and he can tell zechariah you're going to have it now zechariah questioned it and because he questioned it he was smitten dumb and could not speak see this is very symbolic because there's been an angel come in our day and all the old ministry of all the old church ages questioned and when they questioned they were smitten dumb you're not speaking anymore because you questioned the word of the lord coming through the angel of the lord through the messenger and all that messenger was doing was telling you it's time for the prophecies to be fulfilled and in our day an angel come to tell us it's time for the prophecy be fulfilled and those that questioned it and those that doubted it god smitten dumb oh they keep talking they keep talking in microphones but they're not saying nothing smitten dumb but there's a transition that takes place let's look at verse 39. now mary in the meantime she gets a visitation from the same angel gabriel tells her that thou are highly favored you're going to have a child it'll be of the most holy of the most high god son of the most high god and also your cousin elizabeth is is pregnant so verse 39 it says and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into the city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou are among women and blessed is thy fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord shall come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord now this is an amazing amazing scriptures because of where it's placed where right here at the beginning of the new testament the new testament is just beginning these are the one of the first happenings in the sequence of events not in the writing and order because you have matthew marked and look but in the sequence of events this is one of the first things happening and what happens is the old priesthood they doubt smitten dumb but now his wife begins to prophesy and declare the word now zachariah is dumb because of his doubt but elizabeth now is speaking the word and elizabeth is saying what the angel told mary in a private interview how did she know it she caught it by inspiration and by inspiration and revelation the woman is now speaking amen when zechariah is dumb and she said and then she said in verse 45 and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord how does she say that how does she authority to say that how does she know mary believed and how can she guarantee that god will do it this isn't just human she's under inspiration she's filled with the holy ghost speaking by the anointing of the spirit and god is using a woman to declare truths right here in the beginning of the new testament it's foreshadowing friends it's foreshadowing and then mary begins to speak out so my soul does magnify the lord the spirit has rejoiced in god my savior for he he hath regarded my lowest state in his handmaid for behold from henceforth all generation shall call me blessed what's mary now speaking mary now is speaking god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same god has taken the lowly and exalted and he's fed the hungry and the rich go hungry and he's fed me she's saying god's used nothing to do something wonderful god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same and she speaks with boldness so all of this is is to me foreshadowing what's coming so let's go back to genesis 21. i want to grab another part and tie it in here genesis 21 verse 9. in genesis we know there's a prophecy coming for uh the seed of abraham and god had promised abraham that he'll have a seed and sarah began to question this prophecy whether or not she could bring forth she said god has kept it from me so obviously you should take my handmaid and sarah is the one who comes up with the idea of hybriding the word because it's the church that hybrids the word the female not the male amen it was it was eve's idea amen it was sarah's idea because we've got to keep this theme consistent all the way through the scriptures so she said god's withholding for me and so now you're supposed to take hagar and and abraham does produces ishmael and brother memphis said which was a wild which was a wild man amen so now sarah with her plan with her reasonings with her ideas she convinces abraham to hybrid the word she's guilty for hybridization but then god comes down and and he and he meets with abraham he comes to the plains of memory confirms the time of the promise he tells him that you're going to conceive there's a change she conceives she brings forth the promised son and then she weans him and now they're having a celebration they're having a feast for the weaning of of isaac and in verse 9 it says in sarah saul the son of hagar the egyptian which she had borne unto abraham mocking [Music] therefore she said unto abram cast out this bondwoman with her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac and the thing was very grievous in abraham's sight because of his son and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of the bondwoman and all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken under her voice for an isaac shall thy seed be called now abraham abraham is looking at the same woman the same woman who caused who reasoned the word and caused hybridization the same church the same do you understand the same woman now something happens amen when jehovah when god comes down in flesh and after god comes down in flesh and reveals his plan amen something changes in sarah and now you have a change sarah who has conceived on the word and has brought forth the promised son and something now has changed from the reasoning and hybridization now she's conceived on the word and brought forth the promised son and now she says to abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for that son shall not be heir with my child with what has come forth from me with the purity of the promise that's coming forth from me that mixed thing will not be joint heir with this and abraham amen as a man is taken back and he's saying because you know it was your idea to begin with and all of this but there's been a transition that takes place on the plains of mammary and after the transition takes place and she's conceived and produced and brought forth the promised son now when she speaks to abraham god says don't worry listen to the words of your wife hearken to the voice of sarah so let's read it i want to read it and i want to be careful that we read it verse 12 and god said to abram let not it be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of the bond woman and all that sarah has said unto thee hearken unto her voice for an isaac shall thy seed be called hearken under her voice now turn with me to galatians 4. galatians chapter 4. in verse 30. nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman the apostle paul says nevertheless what saith the scripture not what saith sarah what saith the scripture what sarah said was the word of god and became the scriptures and the apostle paul picks up and doesn't say now remember what sarah says he says doth not the scripture say cast out the bondwoman and and now paul is using it in a different application he's bringing into a spiritual application to deal with idolatry and where did he get that scripture he got it from sarah the same one that before her change before god coming in flesh before conceiving on the word she was the very one who hybrid the word amen now something changed in sarah amen and now sarah was turned back young again what do you mean by turning back young again oh praise god let's let's write something i don't know what i'm going to do here nope not that all right sarah had grown old through time [Music] hybrid the word couldn't produce but in order to produce she had to be turned back young again and brother branham comes to the end of the latest ian church age with a church that had hybrid the word that had grown old and can no longer produce and what does that church have to do it has to be turned back young again like it was at pentecost so see the type that church the church at the end has to be turned back amen and go back to what that church was before the church ages started there was 20 years amen from from the day of pentecost until the church age started in a.d 53 and in that time you had a church amen where individuals were baptized in the holy ghost they were born again they lived by the spirit amen they didn't have strict order strict rule they didn't have they didn't have necessarily church buildings and denominations and bishops and hierarchies amen they had men called of god people who recognized the call of god amen the preaching going forward knowing inside that that's true amen what was it it was all the spirit working in the speaker and they hear the spirit moving and the spirit putting in position and moving in position it wasn't an order it wasn't a ritual it wasn't a form it wasn't nicholatinism it wasn't hybrid yet it wasn't man-ordered it was spirit-led church and now in order for sarah to bring forth the promised son she's got to be turned back young again and for this church to receive the promised son it's got to be turned back young again what it was at pentecost before the church ages before the falling away amen what what was that cloud representing when you see that cloud that's him what's him it's the fullness of the holy ghost that had been bound amen from the these denominational rivers bound by chains of creeds and dogmas and doctrines of men but loosed in the evening time by the evening time message amen the holy ghost back in the church again to do what coming back to bring it back to its original condition at pentecost so that that church can do what so that church can conceive the word and bring forth the promised son that's where we're at friends that's the transition sarah made and when sarah made that transition now she recognized i will not tolerate hybridization what do you mean you're the one who's guilty i may have been guilty of it before but i'm changed now i'm not the same sir i was sarah i did that sarah is here now she went through a change she got a name change amen and this bride got a name change from church to bride amen she was turned back amen to what she was when she first married abraham when they were young and capable of producing but it had fallen through seven church ages and grown old and now now infertile and all of those things but now there's a change coming comes with a name change comes a body change where the body of christ is changed back to what it was when it was first supposed to be married to christ i love the word amen i love the word where was individuals catching revelation and being born again by the spirit of god and when she sarah went through that transition she now could recognize that that child cannot be a joint heir with this child that old denominational thinking cast it out that way i used to think cast it out that thing i used to think was a good idea cast it out that that thing my father's dead and my uncles and my aunts and my grand cast it out cast it out she had come to the place when she was turned back and brought forth the son she could recognize the detrimental devastating act of hybridizing the word and she said get it out she could recognize what reasoning would produce she said get it out because what did reasoning produce reasoning produced a mocker of the seed a mocker of the seed that'll mock and make fun of somebody that believes what the prophet said that believes amen that he went beyond the the the and we went beyond the curtain of time and when he went beyond the curtain of time he saw bodies up there that he could touch and handle and he said i saw all of you over there and you say i believe that's true for me too and the hybridization will produce mockers of that hybridization will produce mockers amen who mock at the truths that we hold dear but she had the promised son she had went through the chain she had conceived on the word she was producing the word and she could say we're not going to tolerate hybridization one time i thought that was right but now i know it's wrong at one time that was my idea but it's not my idea no more that was the old me not the new me oh praise god she had a transition in her life we got to have a transition in our life and this bride has gone through a transition back to what it was and now when sarah what caused sarah to say that she said cast out the bondwoman and her child for the child of the bombing shall not be heir with my child the apostle paul tells us that was scripture and when abraham when god comes to abraham because abraham's troubled about it god tells abraham hearken to the voice of thy wife because she's speaking scriptures why because the old testament is foreshadowing our day amen this is not the time for new scriptures this is the time for recognizing the mystery under the water god literally told abraham to listen to her listen to her and paul picks it up see it's interesting to me that it's laying there in shadow form because god had come to abraham how many times and spoke to him directly spoke to him in dream met him in person come to him in flesh god could have said cast out the bondwoman but in the dispensation they were in god's voice was going to come through a woman and that woman said cast out the bondwoman and her child and abraham said i better get it straight from god and god said you done got it listen to her hey amen why because the mantle has fallen from elijah elisha has picked it up amen there's been a double portion given out amen there was a portion of the word that was given out amen and tying together the loose ends there was seals on the front side of the book and seals on the back side of the book there was the tying together of all the loose ends and the latter rain or the former rain the teaching rain teaching the bible restoring the truth that were lost through paul's time but there was going to come a ladder rain and the latter rain was going to come at the third pool at the opening of the word at the revealing of those mystery thunders and so that you would have not one portion but a double portion former reign and ladder reign together and the prophet was the first partaker of that because he wasn't just malachi 4 he was also bride he fulfilled both roles he was also part of the bride i mean he like john also took the book and ate it and prophesied again but we're going to take that same journey and now now we find out that we've got to come take the book and eat the book and get the double portion of the word that was written on the outside of the pyramid and what was on the white stone on the inside that light never shown on this with no writing it was going to be a mystery that was revealed at the end there's a double portion in this pyramid there's the portion on the outside and there's a portion on the inside and we've come to the day where the bride gets the double portion because the spirit that was in elijah which is the lord jesus christ is now in the bride and the bride has the double portion the former and the former and latter reign together and now she is taking the word the sword of the word the mantle of the prophet and she is opening the word and saying see it here and see it here and see it here and see it here can you see the stones here do you see the stones here do you see the stones there can you see the stone how is she doing it she can't do it without a mantle why do you read so many quotes brother chad because that's the mantle you've got to take the mantle and strike the word with the mantle amen because elisha has no mantle elisha has no ability it's got to come from elijah's mantle but elijah's mantle striking the word will open the word at the same spirit as in elisha that was in elijah and now when she starts to say do you see it there do you see it there do you see it there do you see it there you can say wait a minute i want to get it from god [Applause] you're getting it from god amen if god's going to speak in this generation how's he going to do it the spirit and the bride are saying come well i don't trust that i don't want any man injected i don't want any human beings involved in this then throw your bible out the door because it all came through human beings god is still using human beings he's still using flesh vessels tabernacles of flesh he used elijah he used elisha he used john the baptist he used william branham he's using his bride now and the spirit and the bride are saying come and you say i want to get it from the spirit the spirit and the bride are saying come he has a mouthpiece on the earth today and that mouthpiece is in the bride she's the final voice to the final age amen no more sitting by myself refusing to be part of the bride refusing to be part of the body getting it for myself i just want myself just me me me me that's nothing but stinking pride praise god why because god told us how he's going to speak in this day he showed it in the old testament he's brought it through the prophet's ministry he's typed it all over the place he's wrote it in the book of revelation you realize the whole bible's telling the same story let's turn to judges chapter four i want to close right here i think i just want to lay this in judges chapter four i'm telling you years ago this bothered me so bad a few years ago the portion of scripture i want to read to you now i wished wasn't in the bible and now i'm so thankful that it's in the bible because god has opened my eyes to why it's in the bible you look at the book of judges god is raising up judges men men to rule over people men to be prophets to bring forth the word to give instructions from jehovah to the people and they become a mouthpiece for god and a ruler over the people and of all of these judges that are in the book of judges there's 12 of them listed there's one that's a woman and early in the message when i would begin to talk to people about women preachers and they say what about deborah i'm like i wish that ever wasn't in the bible because i had no understanding everything's there for a reason it's placed where it's placed it's there for a reason god had to have one of them judges to be a woman because he's showing at the end time he's going to be speaking through a woman it's going to be the feminine of jesus christ that's speaking in this day so if you were going to come to our day which chapter and judges would you put deborah lion ox man or eagle stalk tassel shuck or wheat amen justification saying the gates baptist or the holy ghost himself i'm just giving you tips hence if you were going to put deborah in there declaring the day we lived in the stage we are in the restoration of the bride tree back to fruit again where the seed is which chapter would you put this woman who's going to judge israel chapter 4 what verse would you mention her name first 4 judges chapter 4 verse 4. and deborah a prophetess the wife of lipidoth she judged israel at that time and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between rhema and bethel and mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment do you know how many lovers of women preachers love this scripture they've totally misplaced it said deborah could never be a priest she was a prophetess she could never be a priest or be a preacher she was a prophetess because when john takes the book in revelations 10 8 and eats it in revelation 10 11 he is to prophesy again elizabeth could not become the priest her husband's mouth was shot but under inspiration she could give forth prophetic words so he got it so look in verse four she's there in verse five she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between rhema and bethel and mount ephraim now if you notice ephraim was the second son of joseph joseph is a perfect type of christ and out of out of joseph comes to manassen ephraim and when when israel goes to bless them he crosses his hands brother iran said signifying the cross where at the cross he goes from jew to gentile amen and he puts the blessing of the right hand on ephraim the gentile because he will be before manasseh because at the cross god will turn from the jews to the gentiles so ephraim always depicts the gentiles so where is deborah living on mount ephraim on gentile mountain and she's living between rhema and bethel she's not in bethel and she's not in rhema she's in between rhema and bethel and bethel means the house of god and the house of god bethel is on the border of ephraim where ephraim which is gentile ephraim house of god borders benjamin benjamin represents the 144th 000 and rhema is a city in the northernmost part of benjamin and bethel is a city in the southernmost part of ephraim you have gentiles and 144 000 and deborah the prophetess in the fourth chapter in the first voice the fourth stage is in between the church age dispensation and the 144 thousand which is exactly where she shows up in revelations 10 10 1-7 the 7th church aged messenger closing out the laodicean church age moving into verse 8 8-11 then chapter 11 verse 1 and 2 is the ministry of prophesying again and then verse 3 and chapter 11 goes to the two witnesses to go to benjamin so in between the gentile dispensation and benjamin in between the ephraim and bethel and rhema and benjamin comes this prophetess named deborah who is the bee because the bee labors to bring forth honey because the word is sweet in thy mouth and bitter in thy belly who's laboring to bring forth the honey from the word today it's the bride of jesus christ that has taken the book and ate the book and prophesying again what is she she's the bee she's the prophetess she's under the palm tree of deborah the poem always signifies righteousness the righteous line and the righteous line under the palm between the church ages and 144 000 the bible has been foreshadowing our day all the way through sarah now giving the scriptures deborah now judging israel all these things that seemed odd zechariah having his mouth shut and elizabeth prophesying under the anointing of the holy ghost [Music] what is it it's the bride age it's the bride age and in the bright age there's gonna have to be a bride who takes the book and eats the book sees that elijah is gone his ministry is complete he's gone but his mantle is here elijah himself left but he left his mantle his prophetic ministry and the spirit that was in elijah come back on elisha on the bride and a double portion of grace grace not just grace to be saved in this day but grace for a body change double grace resurrection and rapturing grace where are we standing revelation 10 between 10-7 and 11-3 between the seventh church age messenger and the two witnesses where are you standing between bethel and rhema who's between bethel and rhema deborah the fourth judge and the fourth chapter in the fourth verse it's almost like god wanted somebody to catch it it's almost like he hit it in a certain way that he'd make sure that somebody catched it and everybody else missed it brother bam says would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture question to brother branham and questions and answers 1963 questions and answers on the seals said sure that's what's going on right now the bride of christ certainly it's the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she's consisted of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble and the resume of the age he says i sincerely believe that the spirit of god has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truths of the ages but he has been faithfully dealing with the hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all the preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of god and follow him it's in listen it's in the preaching and teaching of the word that they hear the voice of god and follow him so you cannot be speaking the voice of god without preaching teaching the word in 1965 the seed is not there with the shuck he says jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that my father hath given me they will come my sheep my doves hear my voice a stranger they will not follow and what is the voice of god is the word of god what's any man's voice but his word it's the word of god they'll hear the word of god how will they hear the word of god because that's god's voice is his word amen and his word is being preached and taught amen by the bride of jesus christ it's a great ministry it's a great ministry in this hour let's go i want to read two scriptures and then we'll close first corinthians 14. first corinthians 14. first corinthians 14 1 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him how be it in the spirit he speaketh mysteries but he that prophesies speaketh unto men to edification and to exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesied edifieth the church i would that you all spake with tongues but rather yes rather paul's saying i wish you had all the gifts i wish everyone and death but rather rather than any of the others rather than that i would rather that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except ye interpret that the church may receive edifying this word prophet prophesy it's used in the traditional way of a prophet to be a prophet to speak forth by divine inspiration to predict the idea of foretelling future events but then there's another usage and definition to utter forth declare a thing which can only be known by divine revelation i would do you all speak with tongues but rather that you prophesy because if you prophesy you speak to the edifying of the whole body amen prophesying is not just amen a traditional prophet comes and tells you something will happen next week but prophesying is to declare something from the word by divine inspiration and revelation and paul said i would that you all speak with jones but rather that you all prophesy because when you come down to the end amen it's john who takes the little book and prophesies again it's deborah in the fourth stage the fourth the fourth judge who is prophesying to israel and in revelation 19 it says the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy what is the spirit of prophecy the testimony of jesus how do you testify of jesus jesus christ is the word he is the word for this day and the testimony of the word for your day i'm not trying to add to the scriptures i'm just the testimony of the word for your day is the spirit of prophecy eat the book and prophesy again testify about him who is he he's the word that's been revealed in our day that's him how do you see him we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest if you can't see the revealed word you can't see him he is the word revealed in this day praise be to god let's all stand musicians if you'd like to come you may have been guilty in the past of hybridizing the word i was you may be guilty of taking reasoning to the word i was but the same one who was guilty of reasoning the promise and hybridizing the word the same one after an encounter on the planes of memory in a change and a conception could look at that thing and says cast that out cast it out but you said cast it out but it was your idea cast it out but you were fine with it last week cast it out something in me has changed why because sarah was now speaking the word of god sarah was now speaking what paul would call scriptures oh praise god i love the word of god amen showing us foreshadowing our day showing us where we're at the mantle has fallen friends have you seen elijah go did you see him go i want to tell you it's a good thing if he goes i mean those prophets they thought it was a bad thing those 50 prophets those school of the prophets they thought it was a bad thing that elijah was going but if elijah didn't go that spirit wouldn't come upon elisha and elisha wouldn't take that mantle himself until elijah was gone elisha was following around elijah doing nothing there was nothing written about what elisha did other than later it says he poured hands on he poured water on the hands of elijah but elisha saw elijah go and i think it's important it's noted for a reason have you seen elijah go then where did that spirit go where did that spirit of the lord jesus christ that was in that vessel where did it go it's in his bride and he left the mantle 1200 tapes he left the mantle and the spirit is here that can take that mantle and strike the word and open it up and when you see that you know where the spirit of elijah is when you see that you know where the spirit of the lord jesus christ is don't be fooled by trickery and things you see with your eyes and big flashes and exciting things watch for the opening of the word amen because christ is always declaring his presence by the opening of the word by the breaking of bread and their eyes were opened when he broke the bread and they saw who he was when he opened the word they recognized it was he when the seals came open only the lamb can open the seals when the seals came open it recognized who was the one that was breaking the seals christ is revealed by the opening of the word find out find the place where the opening of the word is and that's where that spirit is resting god i say it this way i would you all speak with tongues but rather i would rather that we all eat the book and prophesy again amen let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this word and god when we look at it we know it's true it's in too much detail it's in too much perfection it's in it's in so many places and in every jot and tittle and names of cities and places of scriptures and numerology it's everywhere it's overwhelming lord but you're all you're trying to show us who we are the day that we live what our role is on this earth so that we're not distracted by chasing careers and distracted by chasing after things of the world that we would stay focused on what you've called us for lord god i pray that you would put your spirit lord within us lord if there's any here lord who has not taken that journey with elijah all the way across jordan i pray god that you would take him now and god i pray that they could see elijah go and they could receive that spirit and take that mantle and cross back to the other side and share the word with everyone let us live the life let us share what's on our hearts let us declare openly through our mouth and through our actions lord the life that is here on the inside give us your word lord reveal it to us open our eyes to see it we love you god we ask that you would take your children from here let them be lights bright and shining lights in this dark world lighthouses lord places of rescue where people can come and find their way to you may our voice lord as your bride be speaking what we're supposed to where the spirit and the bride say come come come drink of the water of life freely god we love you and we thank you for this word we ask that you would guide us through life in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may take one by side
