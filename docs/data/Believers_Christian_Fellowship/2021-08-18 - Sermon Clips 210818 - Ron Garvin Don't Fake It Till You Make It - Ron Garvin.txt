TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there's these ties that take take that hay as it comes up and they slide it over into the bale chamber and they go over everything's keeping time with the flywheel well also on that gearbox there's a big plunger 14 inches tall 18 inches wide the same size as the bale that's the size of the of the bale chamber the hate comes in there and that plunger punches it and it's just a steady rhythm so i've spent many an hour standing on that wagon the wagon's rocking and the baler is rocking as that plunger big old heavy thing it's a plunging and it's making a it's going at 540 rpm that plunger's making oh 70 or 80 strokes per minute one stroke in less than a second i can hear it now and that plunger is just plunging away cutting it and plunging it and everything looks like making a lot of noise and a lot of dust and a lot of things going on but in the back there's a fascinating mechanism to me it's called the knotter it's a little unit there sets up there and it ties the knots in the haystream it's not doing anything it's just sitting there not doing a single thing all this work going on tines are working cross speed going flywheels are spinning the plungers are plunging tractors are groaning grunting and the guy on the wagon he's a he's a working and the knotters just sit there not doing a single thing there's not much happening on the back of that baler except for one little wheel it's a little star-shaped wheel about that big and it as the hay comes into the chamber that little wheel touches it and it just turns ever so slowly and as that turns slowly it drives a shaft there's a lever on that shaft and as that shaft turns it slowly goes it'll only go up about two inches slowly raises and when it gets to the top it releases snaps a clutch as the plunger comes back out of the chamber two two needles with strings attached to them come up through the bottom the plunger comes back and it's getting ready to come right back in there and snap those needles off that comes up there the knotters flip in a split second tie the knots cut the strings the needles come back out back going at it again and then nothing's happened in the back just that little wheel slowly turning nodders just sitting there needles just sitting there nothing's happening but that metering wheel is slowly turning marking out the time marking out the length of that bale it knows when to tie the bale the guy on the tractor he doesn't determine that the guy on the wagon he doesn't determine that they can adjust it and as they need to but when everything's set properly they just need to wait maybe that tractor not wagon go a quarter mile down the road because because maybe there's not much hay just a little bit and there's not enough to make a bale don't get up there and try to tie the bale the metering wheel knows when it's time to tie the tie the bale just rest and we think you know in our lives nothing's happening i said lord nothing's happening i pray for something nothing happens it's just that same old grind of every day go to work clock in clock out go to church sunday wednesday nothing's happened lord what are you doing what's happening nothing's happening in my life but his wheel is turning measuring knowing the right time to trigger everything and then when it does everything's got to work instantly within less than a second because that plunger is coming right back in less than a second everything's got to get up there tie the knots get get out of the way and go right back to the same old mundane monday through friday wash the kids face feed them their breakfast clean up after them go to church come home clock in clock out nothing's happening god knows he's got a metering wheel on your life in my life
