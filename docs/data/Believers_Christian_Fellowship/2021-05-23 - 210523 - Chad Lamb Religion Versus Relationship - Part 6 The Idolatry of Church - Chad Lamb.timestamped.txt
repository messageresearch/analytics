[3:45] away
[3:47] and this peace that i had the world

[3:52] oh this peace that i had the world
[3:56] didn't give it to me
[3:58] yes this peace that i had oh the world
[4:01] didn't give it to me
[4:03] the world didn't give it so the world
[4:05] can't take it away
[4:06] this long and this love that i had
[4:11] the world didn't give it to me
[4:25] so it can't take it away
[4:28] and it's joy
[4:32] the world did give it to me
[4:53] the world

[5:22] lord we lift our hands in worship
[5:28] as we lift your holy name
[5:32] you deserve the glory
[5:40] [Music]
[5:42] lord we lift our hands in worship
[5:48] as we lift your holy name
[5:52] for you are great you do miracles
[5:59] so great there is no one else
[6:04] like you
[6:08] there is no one else like you
[6:13] you are
[6:19] so great there is
[6:39] praise the lord
[6:42] it's good to know that you serve a great
[6:46] god he said to us
[6:49] jesus said to the disciples he said i am
[6:51] the vine
[6:52] and you are the branches without me you
[6:55] can do nothing
[6:57] when you realize without him you can do
[6:59] nothing
[7:00] and then having a great god becomes more
[7:02] important amen
[7:04] having an all-sufficient one having a
[7:06] mighty god an all-knowing one
[7:08] one who is not ever limited in this
[7:10] power ability becomes everything to us
[7:13] because without him we are nothing amen
[7:17] god is good we sure appreciate him this
[7:19] morning i appreciate the worship
[7:21] amen let's turn to the word let's turn
[7:23] to
[7:25] john chapter 3
[7:28] as we continue on with the subject of
[7:30] religion versus relationship
[7:32] i believe we're on part six if i have
[7:34] that correct
[7:36] and i'd like to take a subject for a
[7:39] subtitle here the idolatry of church
[7:43] and i just pray that you bear with me
[7:45] don't jump to any conclusions but just
[7:47] bear with me and let me share what's on
[7:49] my heart
[7:50] as we move forward and see what the
[7:52] prophet has to say on these things
[7:54] let's look at john chapter 3 verse 19.
[8:02] john chapter 3 verse 19 and this is
[8:05] condemnation that light has come into
[8:07] the world
[8:08] and men love darkness rather than light
[8:11] because their deeds were evil
[8:13] for everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[8:15] light neither cometh to the light
[8:17] lest his deeds should be reproved
[8:21] let's just bow our heads and pray dear
[8:24] lord jesus we thank you father for this
[8:26] goodness that you've given to us
[8:28] for your mercy and your grace lord that
[8:31] in this day of great deception lord you
[8:33] brought a message lord
[8:35] god you brought your seal of approval
[8:37] and your vindication so that we would
[8:39] know
[8:40] god that this word is you and that
[8:42] you've showed us through your word to
[8:44] the opening of the word
[8:45] all that we have need of in this day god
[8:48] you've given us everything
[8:50] your spirit is here lord to quicken the
[8:52] word in your bride
[8:54] to prevent the cycle of failure that's
[8:56] been
[8:57] in the past for you've determined that
[8:59] this is the day
[9:01] that there will be a bride without spot
[9:02] or wrinkle by the washing of the water
[9:05] of your word god you sent your word
[9:08] you're washing your bride now
[9:10] help us to stay under that flow lord
[9:12] that cleansing flow
[9:14] of your revealed word that's washing all
[9:16] the spots of the prostitute spirits away
[9:18] from us
[9:19] god may we stay here and be cleansed
[9:22] unto your word
[9:23] and may you get glory in us lord and god
[9:26] may your strength
[9:27] lord be sufficient for us may your
[9:29] strength undergird us
[9:31] and guide us and lead us and direct us
[9:34] for we're trusting in you and you alone
[9:36] we ask you bless us now this morning
[9:39] that you would take control and have
[9:40] preeminence over this vessel
[9:42] and speak your eternal word lord may you
[9:44] be glorified
[9:46] and may we be equipped in jesus christ's
[9:48] name we pray amen
[9:51] you can all have your seat
[9:57] but i want to read a quote that i've
[9:59] been reading all along
[10:01] out of god hiding himself in simplicity
[10:04] said in the beginning when man sinned it
[10:05] showed the nature of man he
[10:07] always trying to hide from god and make
[10:10] himself a way that he can
[10:12] feel justified a religion that's been a
[10:15] religion means a covering
[10:17] so he tried to make his own religion
[10:20] so we find all the way back in the time
[10:22] in the fall in the garden of eden
[10:24] adam he went to sew fig leaves together
[10:26] because he wanted to make himself a
[10:28] covering
[10:29] and brother bam says this is the nature
[10:31] of man that he's always hiding from god
[10:33] but trying
[10:34] to make himself a way that he can
[10:38] feel justified not necessarily be
[10:41] justified but feel justified
[10:45] and and i said before it doesn't matter
[10:47] how much you feel
[10:48] justified it only matters if you are
[10:51] justified
[10:52] you can feel justified and be wrong but
[10:55] we have to be justified
[10:57] amen and god has given us a way that we
[10:59] can be justified
[11:01] amen and that justification comes by
[11:03] faith and by
[11:04] faith and his word brings the bring us
[11:06] into contact with the atonement
[11:08] and the atonement brings us back into
[11:10] fellowship with god
[11:12] and the message the super sign he says
[11:14] adam he tried to make a super religion
[11:16] without an atonement
[11:18] they're still trying to do it a super
[11:20] religion make a religion so he could
[11:22] live any way he wanted to without an
[11:24] atonement
[11:25] and still have a covering he tried to do
[11:27] it in the beginning and he is still
[11:28] trying to do it but god's provided way
[11:31] was an atonement and it'll never work no
[11:33] other way
[11:34] it has to come back to an atonement
[11:37] this is this is so important and so
[11:40] crucial we've been talking about this
[11:41] but i
[11:42] i hope that it doesn't become redundant
[11:44] to you that i'm reviewing some of these
[11:46] things as we move forward
[11:47] but it becomes so important to realize
[11:50] that that everything god
[11:53] everything god did for his children the
[11:56] devil would come along and try to
[11:57] pervert that very thing
[12:00] and bring deception by the very thing
[12:02] god brought
[12:04] so god god brought them a prophet moses
[12:07] he brought them a law
[12:08] he brought them a structure he brought
[12:09] them in order by which they could
[12:11] approach unto him
[12:12] i mean through the tabernacle through
[12:14] the temple and through the the rituals
[12:16] through the feast through all of that
[12:18] and all of these things were to to be a
[12:20] school master to bring them unto christ
[12:22] to teach them
[12:23] about the plan of redemption and the
[12:25] cycle of redemption and atonement and
[12:27] all of these things
[12:28] until it would bring them unto christ
[12:30] but the devil got into the very thing
[12:32] that god provided
[12:33] and he perverted the thing that god
[12:35] provided so that when the
[12:38] so that when god deemed it was time for
[12:40] the school masters completed his work
[12:42] it's time now for christ to come
[12:44] when christ came they rejected the very
[12:47] thing that the word of god was to bring
[12:49] them to
[12:51] because the very mechanism that god put
[12:53] in place to bring them
[12:54] unto christ was the very thing that the
[12:56] devil perverted and used to
[12:58] to prevent them from coming in contact
[13:01] with christ
[13:02] and eventually would be the reason by
[13:04] which they rejected christ
[13:08] and and it would become the the reason
[13:11] why they
[13:11] killed christ
[13:15] so you see the very thing that god used
[13:19] what would use to bring them as a
[13:20] schoolmaster to bring them unto christ
[13:22] is the very thing that the devil used in
[13:25] a perverted way
[13:27] amen to to move them away from christ
[13:30] until when christ would come in the
[13:32] scene in full manifestation
[13:34] that they wouldn't just reject him that
[13:36] they would murder him
[13:39] and so we have to be very very careful
[13:43] that we take the right approach
[13:47] an attitude to the things of god
[13:52] because the devil is not just say like
[13:55] we've been saying the devil is not
[13:57] trying to use the prostitute in the
[14:00] alcoholic
[14:01] amen to trip up the elect
[14:05] he's using religion he's using the very
[14:07] the very place god is working is the
[14:09] very place the antichrist spirit is
[14:11] working
[14:13] and so we've got to be very diligent and
[14:16] be very careful
[14:17] that that man is always wanting a
[14:20] covering
[14:21] in the beginning he tried to make
[14:23] himself a covering so he could feel
[14:25] righteous
[14:26] so he could feel justified that is and
[14:28] so now
[14:30] uh the devil knows the nature of man
[14:35] so what's the devil going to try to do
[14:37] if that's in the nature of man
[14:39] for a man to try to build himself a fig
[14:42] leaf covering a something of his own
[14:43] hands of his own making
[14:45] that he can use as a covering to hide
[14:47] from god amen and to feel justified
[14:50] then all the devil has to do amen is
[14:52] provide
[14:54] amen by reasoning a way for men to have
[14:57] a covering so that he can feel justified
[14:59] and the nature of man will jump on it
[15:01] every time
[15:03] because that's what man wants man is so
[15:06] desperately
[15:07] man so desperately wants to find
[15:10] security
[15:10] a place where he can feel comfortable
[15:13] and fine and everything is all right
[15:16] that's what we're always seeking that's
[15:18] what that's what retirement accounts are
[15:20] for that that's why the institute of
[15:22] social security that's
[15:23] why we help health insurance and that's
[15:25] what what is all of that
[15:27] it's man desperately seeking security
[15:30] he wants to be secure he wants to be
[15:32] safe that's why he builds
[15:34] hurricane proof houses and
[15:38] you know it's the nature of man he wants
[15:41] to secure himself
[15:42] he wants to know that he's safe and
[15:44] that's why nimrod was so successful
[15:46] amen and and joining the world together
[15:49] because
[15:50] man wants to be secure and nimrod was
[15:53] was telling
[15:54] them that the only way to be safe and
[15:56] secure was to come into a unity
[15:59] agreement of purpose and unified purpose
[16:01] amen to build a city
[16:03] and a tower amen the unification of
[16:05] church and state
[16:07] amen the ecclesiastical horn and the
[16:09] civil horn bring it together
[16:11] that they can build themselves a tower
[16:13] that would withstand the judgment of god
[16:16] lest then also unify them lest they be
[16:18] scattered upon the earth
[16:21] and god desired for them to be scattered
[16:23] upon the earth
[16:24] but they nimrod convinced them that
[16:26] being scattered about the earth would
[16:28] make them
[16:29] insecure or unsafe
[16:32] amen so now the devil is playing on the
[16:36] need of man to have security
[16:38] amen so he provides a way for man to
[16:41] feel secure
[16:42] to have his own security to provide for
[16:45] himself a security
[16:46] when there's nothing that you can do
[16:48] yourself to secure yourself
[16:52] there there every security that you have
[16:56] is a false security
[17:00] i just saw a news article the other day
[17:02] that either 5 000 or 50
[17:04] 000 i don't remember the number
[17:08] insurance policies were canceled
[17:11] ahead of a hurricane season people have
[17:15] been paying in the
[17:16] and the insurance house insurance for
[17:19] their home
[17:20] homeowners insurance and they live in a
[17:22] hurricane area
[17:23] and the insurance companies have been so
[17:24] devastated lately because of hurricanes
[17:27] they've lost so much money
[17:28] and because the insurance company is not
[17:31] there
[17:31] for you to prosper they're there for
[17:33] themselves to prosper
[17:35] they exist to have profits and to
[17:37] prosper they're not in it for you
[17:42] because the devil is not in it for you
[17:44] the securities offers is not really for
[17:46] you it only looks like it's for you
[17:48] so ahead of hurricane season when it
[17:50] looks like it's potentially another
[17:51] season like we had last year
[17:53] as the science is saying they meant just
[17:55] ahead just this month
[17:57] amen they canceled either 5 000 or 50
[17:59] 000. i don't remember
[18:00] policies for homeowners
[18:03] and now homeowners have to scramble and
[18:05] find another policy
[18:07] what are they looking for they're
[18:08] looking for security
[18:11] but the security that that man often
[18:14] looks for is a false
[18:15] security because your insurance company
[18:18] cannot
[18:19] pay the claim they can find
[18:22] something down in the teeny writing on
[18:24] page 27
[18:26] of the document that you scrolled to the
[18:28] bottom of and said i accept
[18:33] why because the because the insurance
[18:35] company is trying to secure themselves
[18:38] that's what that document's for not for
[18:40] your security it's for their security
[18:42] and you buy the insurance claim for your
[18:44] security and i'm not saying don't buy
[18:45] insurance don't this has nothing to do
[18:47] with insurance
[18:49] this is everything to do with the devil
[18:50] playing on the nature
[18:52] of man who wants
[18:55] to feel justified and he wants to be
[18:59] secure and he's willing man is willing
[19:02] to
[19:02] leave the word of god like in nimrod's
[19:05] day
[19:06] leave the word of god to multiply and
[19:08] replenish and replenish abundantly upon
[19:10] the earth
[19:11] they they were willing to leave the word
[19:13] of god and unify themselves to have
[19:15] security
[19:17] and man today is still willing to
[19:20] leave the word of god to find security
[19:25] and jesus says he will who will find his
[19:27] life will lose it
[19:29] but he who will lose his life for my
[19:31] sake shall find it
[19:33] why is it like that because god is
[19:35] requiring that we operate by faith
[19:39] and god god's mechanism for separating
[19:43] amen his righteous seed from the false
[19:45] vine is
[19:46] faith that is the requirement amen so
[19:48] we're saved by grace through faith amen
[19:50] and that not of ourselves it is a gift
[19:51] of god
[19:52] so the mechanism that would cause
[19:54] imputed righteousness
[19:56] amen would it would would be an
[19:58] indication of the grace that's in your
[20:00] life
[20:00] would be the the very thing that god has
[20:03] given to you that is placed within you
[20:05] before the foundation of the world
[20:06] which is the seed of god which is the
[20:08] capacity to believe the word of god
[20:10] and not just any word of god but the
[20:12] word of god for your day
[20:14] and when you believe the word of god for
[20:16] your day for the moment in time in which
[20:18] you're traveling this earth
[20:19] amen it's a signal amen that you're part
[20:22] of that grace
[20:25] and that you're an elect child of god
[20:27] and so god
[20:28] made the mechanism faith not a false
[20:31] security
[20:33] but faith is security
[20:37] but it's not a human mental security
[20:39] it's a different kind of security
[20:41] because faith is the evidence of things
[20:44] hoped for
[20:44] faith is the substance i'm sorry of
[20:46] things hoped for
[20:48] so faith is substance faith is
[20:52] evidence but man
[20:55] cannot without the seeding of god cannot
[20:58] rely on
[20:59] faith so he's looking for security
[21:04] and so now he's
[21:08] like brother brenham said he's trying to
[21:10] find a a super religion which is a super
[21:13] covering or a great covering or powerful
[21:16] covering or whatever kind of covering a
[21:18] super covering
[21:19] a super religion that he could
[21:23] he could be justified without coming to
[21:26] the atonement
[21:28] now we know that the atonement the
[21:31] atonement
[21:33] uh was the substitute or the covering
[21:37] amen the the the blood of an innocent
[21:39] substitute that would cover for you
[21:42] so in order to come to an atonement you
[21:44] have to first come to a
[21:45] judgment and this is the thing that's
[21:48] being avoided by mankind
[21:52] you have to come to a judgment and when
[21:55] you come to the
[21:56] judgment amend then god will
[21:59] pass judgment through his word that you
[22:02] are wrong and you are condemned and
[22:04] your actions are contrary to the word
[22:07] and you
[22:07] your fig leaves are not a good enough
[22:09] covering you're naked before the lord
[22:11] you're exposed
[22:12] and you're guilty amen and for most
[22:15] people
[22:15] that that traumatic experience is
[22:18] something they're not willing to go
[22:19] through
[22:20] but for the children of god god will
[22:22] bring them into
[22:23] judgment so that he can restore
[22:25] fellowship
[22:26] through the atonement so when father god
[22:30] come down in the garden of eden
[22:32] he came down to bring a judgment upon
[22:35] his children and as he brought a
[22:37] judgment upon the children
[22:39] he immediately slayed a lamb to give
[22:41] them a covering to cover their sins
[22:43] so that he could restore back fellowship
[22:46] because he's not just a judge
[22:48] he's a judge to all the world but he's a
[22:50] judge and a father to the elect
[22:54] and the father will bring us to
[22:55] atonement so the devil can
[22:57] easily make a religion appealing
[23:00] because you don't have to come to a
[23:02] judgment and you don't have to come
[23:04] to an atonement amen because it's not
[23:06] about
[23:07] restoring fellowship and unity with god
[23:10] it's about
[23:11] feeling justified
[23:15] and so the psychology of man the nature
[23:18] of man
[23:19] is comfortable with this and we'll go
[23:21] along with it
[23:24] but let's turn to first john chapter 1.
[23:45] first john chapter 1 and verse 5.
[23:54] this then is the message which we have
[23:56] heard of him and declare unto you
[23:58] that god is light and in him has no
[24:00] darkness at all
[24:02] remember we read out of the book of john
[24:04] when we opened up here that john was
[24:06] jesus was saying this is the
[24:08] condemnation that light has come into
[24:10] the world
[24:11] and men loved darkness rather than light
[24:13] for their deeds were evil
[24:15] what does that mean that means they did
[24:17] not want to come into the light because
[24:18] the light would have exposed their deeds
[24:23] they didn't want their deeds exposed
[24:25] because they were fine with their deeds
[24:27] as long as they could feel justified
[24:31] that's what happened with the jewish
[24:32] religion amen when jesus came
[24:35] as he spoke he was uncovering the fig
[24:37] leaves
[24:40] they're fig leaves that they had taken
[24:42] the law of moses and they had
[24:43] added to and they had altered and they'd
[24:46] fit in they'd sown
[24:48] they had taken the word and sown
[24:50] themselves a
[24:51] pattern of fig leaves that now was their
[24:54] covering
[24:54] but as jesus came and did the works
[24:56] which no man had done before and began
[24:58] to expound upon the word
[25:00] of god and answer their questions and
[25:01] not answer their questions and
[25:04] all the things he did all of a sudden
[25:06] their fig loose was turning translucent
[25:10] and then became transparent
[25:15] and then instead of saying oh judge me
[25:17] oh god and give me a covering
[25:19] they said let's get rid of this guy
[25:23] he's taking away our security
[25:27] he's making us uncomfortable
[25:32] praise god now they won't kill him
[25:35] they'll just change churches
[25:38] [Music]
[25:39] because it's it's beginning to make the
[25:42] fig leaf covering translucent and it's
[25:44] becoming transparent
[25:46] and i feel a spiritual pressure
[25:49] and i've got to get rid of that
[25:50] spiritual pressure
[25:52] and so and so many times a changing
[25:55] church there's righteous reasons for
[25:56] changing a church and god will have
[25:58] people change churches all the time
[25:59] and there's nothing wrong with changing
[26:01] a church
[26:02] depending on the motivation why the
[26:05] reason why if god leads and it's perfect
[26:08] amen
[26:09] but if all we're trying to do is find a
[26:12] church order
[26:14] that i can keep and remain comfortable
[26:19] and still be in the message
[26:25] see we're all susceptible to this
[26:28] there's no finger pointing here we're
[26:30] everyone's susceptible to this
[26:33] amen and all of a sudden a spiritual
[26:35] pressure will come
[26:36] and the question is is that the word or
[26:39] not the word amen
[26:40] not how do i feel and i don't like this
[26:43] pressure and i don't like feeling
[26:44] uncomfortable when i come to church
[26:45] but the question is is this the word of
[26:47] god amen is this the
[26:49] judging word of god amen trying to judge
[26:52] my
[26:52] deeds that are in darkness trying to
[26:56] bring me to the light amen
[26:58] are am i am i changing churches by the
[27:01] leadership of god
[27:02] and following the word or am i trying to
[27:05] get away
[27:06] from light so that a part of me can
[27:07] remain in darkness
[27:11] so that i can remain i can dress the way
[27:14] i want to dress and listen to the music
[27:15] i want to listen to and participate in
[27:17] the entertainment
[27:18] and have a little bit of the world
[27:20] without the exposing pressure of that
[27:22] light
[27:23] that's making me uncomfortable because
[27:24] what i'm looking for is comfort
[27:27] not judgment not atonement i'm looking
[27:29] for
[27:32] comfort
[27:34] and so you know churches are different
[27:37] and every church has its own
[27:38] kind of order amen and so sometimes what
[27:42] we do is we shop for an order
[27:45] that we feel comfortable keeping
[27:51] and we've got to the place in the
[27:53] message where we're changing our ladder
[27:55] like the baptist
[27:58] i'm moving my letter from this church to
[28:02] this church
[28:06] but i'm still baptist
[28:14] i'm moving from this church to this
[28:17] church so i can still be in the message
[28:24] but that the word won't make me
[28:25] uncomfortable anymore
[28:31] now it's not true for everybody it's
[28:34] only true for some
[28:36] and i have no idea who it's true for and
[28:38] not true for
[28:39] because it's an individual affair
[28:42] but we're all susceptible to this kind
[28:45] of
[28:46] thinking this nature of man
[28:49] and we have to get away from that
[28:51] denominational thinking that thinks
[28:53] i can just move my letter or move my
[28:56] membership
[28:57] from one assembly to another at my own
[28:59] will for my own comfort and my own peace
[29:01] and my own this and that and
[29:03] everything's okay because i'm still in
[29:04] the message
[29:05] you may have never been in the message
[29:07] to start with
[29:09] because the message is christ it's not a
[29:11] group of people it's not a building
[29:13] it's not a church it's not a it's not a
[29:16] common understanding it's not a set of
[29:18] doctrines even
[29:19] amen the message is christ it's a living
[29:21] breathing jesus christ
[29:23] present today that is the message
[29:26] and so many people want to get free from
[29:29] an uncomfortable feeling
[29:30] and stay in the message and the question
[29:32] is were you ever in the message
[29:36] because you can't join into the message
[29:39] you can't become part of the church and
[29:40] be in the message amen
[29:42] only way you're in the message is by a
[29:44] new birth you have to be born into
[29:46] christ
[29:47] [Music]
[29:52] amen and then
[29:55] when the preaching makes you
[29:56] uncomfortable then there's a question to
[29:59] say is that the word or not the word
[30:01] not how comfortable i am is is it the
[30:03] word or is it not the word
[30:07] if it's the word we say god judge me
[30:11] if it's not the word we say god help my
[30:13] brother
[30:15] that still doesn't mean that you have to
[30:17] leave until that's god leads you away
[30:19] but you definitely don't have to swallow
[30:21] down what's not the word
[30:24] and say god help my brother
[30:29] so let's go back to first john
[30:33] chapter 1 verse 5.
[30:37] i read the first verse 5 but i'll read
[30:39] it again this then is the message which
[30:41] we have heard of him
[30:42] and declare unto you that god is light
[30:44] and in him is no darkness
[30:46] at all if we say that we have fellowship
[30:48] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[30:50] do not the truth
[30:51] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[30:54] the light
[30:56] present tense light
[31:00] walk in the light as he is in the light
[31:02] not where the light was shining
[31:04] but where the light is shining
[31:07] we walk in the light as he is in the
[31:09] light we have fellowship one with
[31:11] another
[31:12] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[31:15] cleanses us from all sin
[31:20] walking in the light will bring us into
[31:23] the atonement that's why brother branham
[31:25] said they believe they're getting people
[31:26] to the blood but they've rejected the
[31:28] very plan to get to the blood the word
[31:31] what word the word for your day amen is
[31:34] the walking in the light as he is in the
[31:36] light and if you walk in the light as he
[31:38] is in the light
[31:39] that's the only way he had to have
[31:40] fellowship with one another
[31:42] amen having a fellowship meeting doesn't
[31:44] equal fellowship
[31:47] having something labeled fellowship is
[31:48] not fellowship the only way to have
[31:50] fellowship one with another is to walk
[31:52] in the light as he is in the light
[31:53] and then we have fellowship with one
[31:54] another and the blood of jesus christ
[31:57] cleanses us from all sin but if we
[32:01] choose to remain in darkness
[32:02] how are we going to get to the blood
[32:04] amen that brings an atonement and at one
[32:06] that with god that brings us back into
[32:08] fellowship with god
[32:11] see we have to walk in the light and
[32:13] there's no darkness
[32:15] in him at all so the light will expose
[32:18] all the dark cracks of us
[32:24] the it'll the light will shine down and
[32:26] believe you me
[32:28] amen the light of this gospel will find
[32:29] a way to find the crack that you didn't
[32:31] know was there
[32:34] and it will find the dark spot that you
[32:36] had no clue that you had
[32:39] and it will begin to shine the light in
[32:40] that amen so that it can be purged so
[32:43] that we can be clean
[32:45] now in the message satan's eden the
[32:47] prophet of god says dear dear god
[32:50] he's in prayer now dear god on this
[32:51] platform there's this desk
[32:54] tonight where the gospel has been laid
[32:55] lord here lays handkerchiefs and
[32:57] little parcels that go into sick and
[32:59] afflicted let the prayer of faith lord
[33:02] fall from our hearts now in our sight
[33:04] and your sight
[33:05] then lord if there be any unclean thing
[33:07] in us lord take
[33:09] take us to judgment now
[33:12] what's brother brandon praying for make
[33:15] me feel okay
[33:16] i want to be all right he says he's
[33:18] coming amen he's coming in prayer and he
[33:20] says
[33:20] take us to judgment now
[33:25] and we plead for mercy
[33:29] if you're going to ask god to judge you
[33:30] you better plead for mercy
[33:33] reveal to us what we're doing wrong lord
[33:36] so we can
[33:36] ask to take the blood and cleanse us
[33:45] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[33:48] brother says notice in this last day
[33:50] lucifer is doing the same thing
[33:52] can you see it the devil doing the same
[33:54] thing
[33:55] building a hybrid church a hybrid by
[33:57] hybrid members
[33:58] hybrid by knowledge instead of the word
[34:00] by intellectual men instead of born
[34:02] again men
[34:03] building an intellectual kingdom that
[34:04] will outshine christ's little bitty
[34:06] flock
[34:07] see what is it that did that fallen
[34:10] angels
[34:12] the bible said it was fallen angels who
[34:13] listened to lucifer instead of christ
[34:15] who they once belonged to is that right
[34:18] now listen close fallen angels what kind
[34:20] of angels
[34:20] luther wesley catholic pentecostals who
[34:23] kept not their first estate like the
[34:25] angels did and has fell into
[34:27] organization
[34:28] like lucifer's main hold at nicaea and
[34:31] what have they done
[34:32] organized the great ecumenical
[34:34] association of ministers to make an
[34:36] image unto the beast as the bible said
[34:39] and
[34:39] and building a christian economy that
[34:41] will close the doors of this church and
[34:43] others like it
[34:44] see lucifer at his work i'm trying to
[34:47] bring you
[34:48] the threefold revelation or mystery of
[34:51] god what did they do
[34:53] sold out to reasonings of wisdom and
[34:55] education like eve did
[34:56] fallen angels did wesley was a man of
[34:59] god but what followed him
[35:00] fallen angels got into him what was the
[35:03] angel's first
[35:03] creative beings of god but fell for
[35:05] lucifer's wisdom
[35:06] fell for lucifer's wisdom and you see
[35:09] what they become
[35:10] fallen angels and organizations from men
[35:12] of god who has went forth to establish
[35:14] truths in the earth
[35:15] before that truth could go on and
[35:17] proclamate and get on to the real
[35:19] revelation of christ
[35:20] fallen angels came in and took it over
[35:23] and made a denomination
[35:24] made denominations out of it that's the
[35:27] reason the revelation of the seven seal
[35:30] mystery had to be unfolded
[35:34] what did he just say he said the reason
[35:38] the mystery of the seventh seal the
[35:41] reason the revelation of the seventh
[35:42] field mystery had to be unfolded
[35:44] is because fallen angels are out there
[35:49] constantly getting into every move of
[35:52] god
[35:54] what are the fallen angels getting into
[35:56] the bar room and the prostitute and the
[35:59] sports arena no the fallen angels were
[36:02] getting into
[36:03] every move of god and the fallen angels
[36:06] were now coming
[36:07] and they were convincing the people to
[36:10] stop
[36:10] moving with the light and to take this
[36:14] truth of god
[36:15] and fashion it by your own fashioning
[36:18] into a covering
[36:22] that's what the fallen angels have done
[36:24] and they've done it all the way through
[36:26] and they keep doing it all the way
[36:28] through but
[36:29] that's why brother branham said the
[36:31] revelation of the seventh
[36:32] mystery had to come why why would it
[36:35] come now
[36:36] because he prophesied that he would have
[36:39] a bride without spot or wrinkle
[36:42] the prophecy oh get this friends
[36:45] the prophecy of having a bride without
[36:47] sprout or wrinkle
[36:48] is the reason there had to be a prophecy
[36:51] of malachi 4. the reason there had to be
[36:55] a prophecy
[36:56] of luke uh of luke 7 uh elected luke 17
[36:59] 30.
[37:00] the reason had to be a prophecy of
[37:01] revelations 10 7
[37:03] amen is because all the way back in the
[37:05] beginning adam was presented a bride
[37:08] fresh from his side
[37:11] and that bride fell in god's original
[37:13] plan
[37:14] amen went into ruin and he's been
[37:16] rebuilding the masterpiece
[37:17] amen so he's got to come to a time when
[37:19] he has a bride that won't fall
[37:21] the same way the bride has always fallen
[37:26] how has it fallen because the two vines
[37:29] intertwine and come together and the
[37:31] false vine begins to build a system
[37:33] around every truth of god
[37:34] and the elect of god get trapped into
[37:36] that system
[37:39] but god at the end time they brought the
[37:41] revelation of the seven seal mystery
[37:44] and peeled back amen that veil
[37:47] of denominationalism amen he peeled back
[37:50] he took the sword of the word and he
[37:51] ripped that veil from top to bottom
[37:53] amen so that you could see christ and
[37:55] you could see the mercy seat
[37:58] which is christ and he unwound those two
[38:02] vines
[38:04] why did the seven seal mystery have to
[38:06] be revealed in this day
[38:07] because of what happened all the way
[38:10] down through the bible
[38:12] fallen angels got in
[38:15] but praise god after the opening of the
[38:17] seals he killed all the fallen angels
[38:19] and they're not on earth anymore and
[38:22] they're not trying to influence where
[38:24] god's working no more
[38:26] they quit all their tactics they
[38:28] surrendered and said i give up that
[38:30] revelation was too much for me and i'm
[38:31] not even going to try anymore
[38:36] praise god
[38:43] brother brahm says in the message going
[38:44] beyond the camp
[38:47] more and more i'm made to believe that
[38:48] people are not getting to christ
[38:52] now i'm here to try to help in every way
[38:54] that i can and make my statement as
[38:56] clear as i know how to make them
[38:58] and you suffer with me if you will as i
[39:01] look and i preach across the nation and
[39:02] watch people i am fully persuaded that
[39:04] people are not getting to christ
[39:06] and i believe that it's the enemy that's
[39:08] throwed this hindrance because the
[39:10] reason i believe this
[39:11] he's not the object that they have been
[39:13] pointed to
[39:15] they have either been pointed to a dogma
[39:17] or a doctrine or a party or experience
[39:20] or a sensation
[39:21] or something like that instead of being
[39:23] pointed to christ
[39:24] the word if we're
[39:28] pointing people to anything but the word
[39:31] we're not pointing them to christ
[39:36] and i'd like to be careful and that we
[39:39] we make sure that we understand
[39:42] that we also know that pointing them to
[39:46] the word
[39:47] is pointing them to the light as he is
[39:49] in the light
[39:52] not where the light was but where the
[39:53] light is
[39:55] so as time progresses through a day and
[39:58] the sun
[39:59] moves through the sky if i want to point
[40:01] people to the light i must point to
[40:03] where
[40:04] that sun is in the sky so at nine
[40:07] o'clock
[40:08] in the morning i would say right there's
[40:10] the sun do you see it
[40:12] but if we get to noon time and i keep
[40:15] saying back there's the sun
[40:16] it was there i know it was there just
[40:19] keep looking there
[40:23] then you're no longer pointing them to
[40:25] the sun
[40:28] then you might catch up and say oh it's
[40:30] right there oh i i'm sorry
[40:33] but then six o'clock in the evening amen
[40:36] you can't point there anymore and you
[40:38] can't point there anymore but you've got
[40:40] to point over here
[40:41] and say this is where the sun is that's
[40:43] he's right there
[40:46] you see too many people are being
[40:48] pointed to the glare of a previous age
[40:50] and thinking that's light and not
[40:53] finding an atonement and not finding a
[40:56] restoration of fellowship with god
[40:59] so because they're not finding a
[41:01] restoration of fellowship with god
[41:03] satan is always the perverter who moves
[41:05] in and he's trying to take
[41:07] god's proper place of worship amen
[41:11] and so now when you point somebody to
[41:14] the glare of a previous age and you
[41:15] point them to a place where the sun's
[41:16] not shining
[41:17] amen because the sun was there and the
[41:19] sun's still shining there's some light
[41:21] left there
[41:25] so there could be a deception there
[41:26] could be a reflection there could be
[41:28] i mean there's still some light there
[41:30] somebody may not understand and they
[41:31] they go to walk in that light
[41:33] amen but because christ has moved on
[41:37] and you must come to him in present
[41:39] light to find atonement
[41:41] amen in restoration of fellowship with
[41:43] your father
[41:44] now you go back and you'll be brought
[41:47] into fellowship
[41:48] with the church
[41:57] and if it's the wrong kind of church
[41:59] you'll be brought into fellowship with
[42:01] satan himself
[42:03] because he's the head of the false
[42:05] church
[42:10] he said how can this be it's the way
[42:12] it's always been
[42:15] it is today like it's always been
[42:22] he said i'm still in going beyond the
[42:24] camp
[42:26] that's why i think that people are
[42:27] resting their eternal destination upon
[42:29] some dogma
[42:31] or some sensation like said i danced in
[42:33] the spirit i spoke with tongues
[42:34] i felt fire run over me and do you know
[42:37] all those things can be impersonated by
[42:39] the devil
[42:40] there's just one thing that he cannot
[42:42] impersonate that's the word
[42:45] in the debate between he and jesus each
[42:47] time jesus defeated him it is written
[42:49] the word and i believe today that the
[42:51] reason the people are not coming to
[42:52] christ is because they're pete
[42:54] pointed many of them to a denomination
[42:57] you come join our
[42:58] church or you read our catechism or
[43:00] believe our doctrine or some
[43:02] system of some sort they're appointed in
[43:04] the wrong way and their action and the
[43:06] life that they live without christ
[43:08] proves in their own life is vindicated
[43:10] by that very thing
[43:12] for instance i don't want to hurt
[43:13] anyone's feelings but back and forth
[43:15] across the nation i have condemned women
[43:17] wearing short hair
[43:18] that's the bible i've condemned women
[43:20] wearing shorts using makeups
[43:22] and every year it gets worse it shows
[43:24] that there is another finger pointing
[43:26] somewhere pointing them some other way
[43:29] and they're not getting through to
[43:30] christ
[43:33] and they say we belong to a church our
[43:35] church don't
[43:36] don't make no any difference what your
[43:39] church believes
[43:43] and i say whether right or wrong it
[43:45] don't make any difference what makes the
[43:47] difference is what you believe
[43:51] now you want to go to a church that
[43:52] believes right
[43:54] but the real question is what do you
[43:55] believe
[43:59] you can believe wrong in a right church
[44:02] you can believe right in the wrong
[44:03] church
[44:07] but a right church doesn't make you the
[44:09] right believer and the wrong church
[44:10] doesn't make you the wrong believer
[44:11] necessarily
[44:13] this is about the individual now
[44:16] let's go to mark 16
[44:20] and take a look at a few scriptures
[44:29] mark chapter 16
[44:33] and verse 15.
[44:36] mark 16 and 15.
[44:46] and he said unto them go you into all
[44:48] the world and preach the gospel
[44:50] to every creature he that believeth and
[44:52] is baptized shall be saved but he that
[44:54] believeth not
[44:56] shall be damned and these signs shall
[44:58] follow them that believe in my name they
[45:00] shall cast out devils they shall speak
[45:01] with new tongues
[45:02] they shall take up serpents and if they
[45:04] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[45:06] thee
[45:06] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[45:08] they shall recover them
[45:09] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[45:11] them he was received up into heaven
[45:13] and sat on the right hand of god and
[45:15] they went forth and preached everywhere
[45:17] the lord working with them
[45:19] and confirming the word with signs
[45:21] following
[45:23] the reason that i read this a very
[45:25] specific reason is this is
[45:27] jesus's commission to his church and
[45:29] when he commissions them the believers
[45:31] there
[45:31] he tells him to go preach the gospel and
[45:33] he promises that he'll back up the
[45:34] gospel with signs following
[45:36] as a vindication that what they're
[45:38] preaching is the truth
[45:40] but jesus did not set
[45:43] up the order of the church first
[45:46] what he told him was to go preach the
[45:48] gospel
[45:50] he would send paul along later
[45:53] to set the order of the church
[45:56] so the bible pattern has laid out a very
[46:00] specific pattern amen the first thing
[46:03] that you do
[46:04] is preach the gospel not get somebody to
[46:06] church
[46:09] because there's an order and a structure
[46:11] to church paul set it up if paul set it
[46:13] up it's correct
[46:16] so what paul god sent paul along and
[46:18] paul was there to establish the church
[46:20] and set the order of the church amen but
[46:23] when when christ first sent out the
[46:25] disciples
[46:26] he didn't start by setting up the order
[46:28] of the church
[46:29] and inviting people to come into the
[46:31] order of the church
[46:33] he told them to go and preach the good
[46:35] news preach the gospel preach the
[46:37] present day truth and as many as believe
[46:38] they would be baptized and that didn't
[46:40] believe they would be damned
[46:42] and after the message after the message
[46:45] was getting out and getting spread
[46:46] the apostle paul would come along and
[46:48] establish the church so we make sure
[46:50] that we have to get the right
[46:52] order and they have to get the right
[46:53] thing in the right
[46:55] order the first thing to do is preach
[46:57] the gospel of jesus christ
[47:01] and then plant and establish the church
[47:04] in the order of the church
[47:06] but many times we get things backwards
[47:10] and we tried to bring people or even
[47:12] ourselves
[47:13] tried to get into the order of the
[47:15] church
[47:17] in order to receive the gospel
[47:21] but you can come to the order of the
[47:23] church
[47:24] and never receive the gospel you can be
[47:27] raised in the order and structure of the
[47:30] church and it can be a correct order and
[47:32] a correct structure
[47:33] amen but unless you've heard the gospel
[47:36] and repented and be baptized
[47:40] the order of the church does it come
[47:42] first amen the gospel comes first
[47:47] that's why if we invite somebody to
[47:50] church we invite them to hear the word
[47:51] we don't invite him to become part of
[47:52] the church
[47:56] amen because
[48:00] it's it's ingrained in the nature of man
[48:06] to want to find security and if now
[48:09] a man or a woman has confidence in
[48:11] another man or a woman
[48:12] and they have confidence in spiritual
[48:14] and they have confidence when they tell
[48:15] them
[48:16] that this church is right this is right
[48:19] doctor in the right order the right
[48:21] truth we've had a prophet
[48:22] it's all right come to our church you
[48:25] can convince somebody to join the church
[48:29] that hasn't even received the gospel yet
[48:34] because of their confidence in you
[48:38] and that where you're at it's correct
[48:41] and so they're
[48:42] taking your experience and then when
[48:44] they become part of the church
[48:46] now they get ingrained into the church
[48:48] become part of the worship come every
[48:50] sunday
[48:50] pay their tithes amen start even helping
[48:53] out in the church and participating in
[48:54] fellowships
[48:55] and they become part of the church life
[49:00] and never yet have come to the gospel
[49:05] that's what brother brown's talking
[49:06] about and so when jesus sent them out he
[49:09] established
[49:10] preach the present day truth first
[49:15] and then he'll send paul along to
[49:17] establish the church
[49:21] i i'm going to try to be careful today
[49:26] because the truth of god is a razor's
[49:29] edge
[49:31] one step to the right is the same as a
[49:34] mile
[49:35] million miles away one step to the left
[49:37] and brother bam said god can get you off
[49:39] on the left or to the right
[49:41] you can decide that you know churches
[49:43] are problems and ministries are a
[49:44] problem and people mess up the message
[49:46] so i'm going to stay home and listen to
[49:47] tapes all by myself
[49:49] but that's contrary to what the prophet
[49:51] is contrary to what paul established
[49:55] so that would be wrong but then to think
[49:58] well well you know you know i know that
[50:01] god is now manifesting his bride
[50:03] amen this is a church where the bride is
[50:05] i'm going to go join myself to the
[50:06] church to be part of the bride
[50:10] and that's just as wrong
[50:14] although you're all you're performing
[50:17] the commandments of the apostle paul and
[50:20] you're
[50:20] gathering together for church and and
[50:22] your all the order and structure of the
[50:24] church
[50:25] and submitting yourself to the elder
[50:27] although you're you're performing the
[50:29] commandments of paul
[50:30] amen you haven't even come the right way
[50:33] amen you're not even walking in the
[50:35] light as he is in the light
[50:36] because you want to be joined to it amen
[50:39] but you can't be joined to it you have
[50:41] to be birthed
[50:41] in it
[50:44] and so men can get the wrong concept so
[50:47] when i
[50:48] start to talk about church i i i'm
[50:51] i'm referring to the wrong approach to
[50:54] church
[50:55] and when i say the adult thy idolatry of
[50:58] church
[50:59] i know there's a true church but brother
[51:01] branham many times in his language at
[51:03] the end
[51:04] he's trying to separate church and bride
[51:06] the bride is a church
[51:08] a called out people that's absolutely
[51:09] right but then the rest of the church
[51:11] brother branham is painting in a very
[51:13] negative light
[51:15] because he's trying to bring the bride
[51:16] out of the church amen and there is a
[51:19] bride church the bride is a church
[51:22] but the whole church let's say a local
[51:25] assembly
[51:25] that believes the message the whole
[51:27] church is not bright
[51:31] is that fair that's not nice to say but
[51:34] brother branham said it
[51:36] in every group you have believers make
[51:38] believers and unbelievers and you cannot
[51:41] attend the right assembly and to be
[51:43] bright and then
[51:44] right the right attendance in the right
[51:46] assembly does not guarantee brideship
[51:50] even the even though the bride should
[51:53] gather to a local assembly
[51:56] see the fine line you can't do away with
[51:59] it
[51:59] but neither can you overemphasize it
[52:10] i'm still
[52:13] wanting to read here and going beyond
[52:16] the camp
[52:18] he said now i know there's some reason
[52:21] that people are not getting through to
[52:23] christ
[52:24] if they would they wouldn't act like
[52:25] that jesus suffered without the gates
[52:28] that he might sanctify his people with
[52:30] his own blood
[52:30] sanctification comes from a greek word
[52:32] compound which means
[52:34] cleaned and set aside for service and
[52:36] when god cleans his people with the
[52:37] blood of jesus he cleans them from the
[52:39] filth of the world and sets them aside
[52:41] for service
[52:42] wherever jesus also that he might
[52:44] sanctify the people with his own blood
[52:45] suffered without the gate even to the
[52:48] full gospel people has come right
[52:50] back into the rut that they come out of
[52:53] what was the pentecostal church 40 or 50
[52:55] years ago
[52:56] they cursed and damned and ridiculed the
[52:58] churches they come out of them
[53:00] denominations
[53:01] what did they do just like a dog to its
[53:03] vomit and a sow to its wallow
[53:05] they turned right back in the same place
[53:07] that they were hewed from
[53:08] from now and now their churches is just
[53:11] as filthy as the rest of them brother
[53:14] bannon is standing here
[53:15] and he's in 1960 whatever is preaching
[53:18] this
[53:19] and he's looking back at the revival of
[53:21] 1906
[53:23] and now he's just a little over 50 years
[53:25] after that and he says they
[53:27] they curse the very thing they come out
[53:29] of and they've come right back
[53:30] why fallen angels got in and brought
[53:32] them right back to what they were
[53:36] and they're just as filthy he says
[53:42] it was something as i said this morning
[53:44] like the people are like peter said in
[53:46] in saint matthew 17 4-8 where he said it
[53:49] is good to be here let's build three
[53:50] tabernacles
[53:52] but the spirit bade the spirit made them
[53:55] not to do it said this is my beloved son
[53:57] hear ye
[53:58] him and he is the word that's who we're
[54:01] to look to the word
[54:02] not our enthusiasm or something else he
[54:05] is
[54:06] my word hear ye him and what did they
[54:09] see after his voice spoke to them
[54:11] even moses and elijah wasn't present
[54:14] neither was there a creed neither was
[54:15] there anything left but jesus only and
[54:17] he is the word
[54:19] that's all they seen now going without
[54:22] the camp so now
[54:24] when they were up on mount
[54:25] transfiguration and they they saw on a
[54:28] vision moses and elijah speaking with
[54:29] jesus
[54:30] and moses and elijah represented the the
[54:33] old testament represented the law and
[54:35] the prophets
[54:36] and when they saw this that peter says
[54:39] let's build three
[54:40] temples and he's saying no you don't
[54:42] understand all that was to bring you to
[54:45] this
[54:48] let's not go back and build a temple to
[54:50] moses moses was pointing you to christ
[54:52] let's not go back and build a temple to
[54:54] the prophets the prophets were pointing
[54:56] you to christ
[54:56] let's not go back and erect any edifice
[54:59] or build anything
[55:01] amen to show glory for a former life all
[55:03] the former light was trying to bring you
[55:05] to
[55:06] present tense light and he said this is
[55:09] my beloved son
[55:10] hear ye him what is that
[55:14] the word what word the revealed word for
[55:16] your day
[55:17] hear ye him
[55:21] and satan's eden he says now let us look
[55:23] now to this great
[55:24] for a few minutes this great sinful day
[55:26] that we're now living in
[55:28] i don't believe there was ever a day
[55:30] that i've
[55:31] ever read in history there's been
[55:34] greater days of persecution when the
[55:35] children of god was put to death on
[55:37] every hand
[55:38] but to see the deceitfulness of the
[55:40] enemy we've never had a day like this
[55:42] we're now
[55:43] living what's the most deceitful age
[55:47] this is the most deceitful age and why
[55:50] did the revelation the seven seals
[55:52] mystery have to come open
[55:53] because of what happened to the church
[55:55] ages and down through history
[55:56] amen it had to come open because this is
[55:58] the most deceitful age amen but this is
[56:00] the age that he's going
[56:02] to have victory and he's going to rise a
[56:04] bride out of this egg
[56:06] and lift her up by his word and she's
[56:08] not going to fall in the same trap of
[56:10] the devil she's fell in before
[56:13] that's what the opening of the seals did
[56:15] for us
[56:16] it took the veil away so this thing
[56:19] could be exposed
[56:23] he said there's been greater days of
[56:24] persecution when the children of god was
[56:26] put to death on every hand
[56:28] but to see the deceitfulness of the
[56:30] enemy we've never had a day like this
[56:32] we're now living
[56:33] it's the most cunning deceitful day and
[56:36] when i see that it brings this that the
[56:38] christian has to be more on his toes
[56:40] today
[56:41] than he ever was in any age
[56:46] so don't get comfortable
[56:50] because i've got a good church and we've
[56:53] got
[56:54] we know we've got a message we've got a
[56:56] good church and we've got all that
[56:57] this is not the time to relax and get
[56:59] comfortable and say all is well with me
[57:01] everything is fine this is the time for
[57:04] the christian to be more on his toes
[57:06] than ever before
[57:12] now back in the days of the persecution
[57:14] of rome to the church a christian make a
[57:16] mistake
[57:17] he went into the arena and was fed to
[57:18] the lions or something like that
[57:20] when they found him of being a christian
[57:21] for his testimony but his soul was saved
[57:24] because he was a purely unadulterated
[57:25] believer in god
[57:26] and gladly sealed his testimony with his
[57:29] blood as the veins let loose through the
[57:31] holes in his body and
[57:32] the blood bled out he would scream up
[57:34] with real royal faith and say receive my
[57:36] spirit lord jesus
[57:38] but now the cunningness of the devil now
[57:41] makes the people believe that they are
[57:42] christians when they're
[57:44] not
[57:47] there is the thing you don't have to see
[57:49] oh it's more cunning day than it would
[57:51] be
[57:52] than when you had to seal your life away
[57:54] with your testimony
[57:55] the devil has said every cunning trap
[57:57] that he can he's a deceiver
[57:58] and jesus told us in matthew 24 how
[58:01] this day would be that we're living in
[58:04] the most deceitful day that ever lived
[58:06] so close that it would deceive the very
[58:08] elected of god
[58:09] of god if it were possible for him to
[58:11] deceive
[58:13] again in satan's in he says the god of
[58:16] this world today
[58:18] the worshiped person of this world today
[58:21] is satan
[58:22] and the people are ignorant of
[58:24] worshiping satan
[58:25] but it's satan impersonating himself as
[58:27] the church
[58:33] satan impersonating himself as the
[58:35] church see
[58:36] as the church they worship satan
[58:38] thinking they are worshiping god through
[58:40] the church
[58:41] but it's the way satan has done it
[58:44] oh you say but wait a minute we preached
[58:46] the word look back here at my text satan
[58:48] was the one that preached the word to
[58:49] eve first
[58:50] god has said see it's that misconstruing
[58:53] the part of the scripture that applies
[58:54] to the day
[58:55] he'll let you know all jesus did was
[58:57] perfectly well he'll let you know all
[58:59] that moses did was perfectly well
[59:00] but when you take the promises that they
[59:02] give for this day then that was applied
[59:04] to another age
[59:09] let's turn to numbers 21.
[59:38] numbers 21
[59:42] and verse 6. and the lord sent
[59:46] fiery serpents among the people and they
[59:48] bit the people and much people of israel
[59:50] died
[59:51] therefore the people said to moses and
[59:53] said we have sinned for we have spoken
[59:55] against the lord and against thee
[59:57] pray on pray unto the lord that he take
[59:59] away the serpents from us
[1:00:00] and moses prayed for the people and the
[1:00:03] lord said unto moses make thee a fiery
[1:00:05] serpent
[1:00:06] and set it upon a pole and it shall come
[1:00:08] to pass that every one that is bitten
[1:00:10] when he look
[1:00:10] looketh upon it shall live and moses
[1:00:13] made a serpent of brass and put it upon
[1:00:15] a pole
[1:00:16] and it came to pass that if a serpent
[1:00:17] had bitten any man
[1:00:19] then when he lit when he believe beheld
[1:00:21] the serpent of brass
[1:00:23] he lived let's go to second kings
[1:00:28] chapter 18.
[1:00:31] we're all very familiar with the brazen
[1:00:33] serpent it's
[1:00:35] it's actually a foreshadow of jesus
[1:00:37] christ
[1:00:38] paying the price of atonement for our
[1:00:40] fiery bite that we received to the
[1:00:42] serpent
[1:00:43] in the garden of eden and so it's a
[1:00:46] foreshadow of jesus christ it's a good
[1:00:48] sign
[1:00:50] it was a it was a good serpent on a good
[1:00:52] pole
[1:00:53] and it brought real healing it brought
[1:00:55] an actual atonement for that day
[1:00:57] it was the word of god manifest in that
[1:00:59] day and the word of god manifest in that
[1:01:01] day was bringing life
[1:01:03] from the bite of the fiery serpent is
[1:01:06] that right
[1:01:07] so it was the light it was the life it
[1:01:09] was the word the prophet had brought it
[1:01:11] amen according to what god's word was
[1:01:13] that he made the serpent on a pole and
[1:01:15] and he and they lifted it up and and
[1:01:17] it's just it's pointing to christ being
[1:01:19] lifted up and
[1:01:20] and dying on a cross to pay the price
[1:01:22] for the fiery bite of the serpent
[1:01:24] or the bite of the fiery serpent so it
[1:01:26] was a good sign it was
[1:01:27] it was a it was a good um
[1:01:31] it was a good piece it was the word of
[1:01:34] the lord for that day
[1:01:36] and it was correct but let's look at
[1:01:39] second kings 18
[1:01:41] when we come into the kingdom of
[1:01:43] hezekiah hezekiah becomes king and he
[1:01:45] starts to do many things
[1:01:46] and in verse 4 it says he removed the
[1:01:49] high places
[1:01:50] and break the images and cut down the
[1:01:51] groves and break in pieces the brazen
[1:01:54] serpent that moses had made
[1:01:56] same brazen serpent why did moses make
[1:01:59] it because god told him to
[1:02:00] what was the purpose to save life
[1:02:04] so the servant that moses had made for
[1:02:06] unto those
[1:02:07] those days the children of israel did
[1:02:09] burn incense to it and he
[1:02:11] called it nahushtan
[1:02:15] they began to worship the brazen serpent
[1:02:21] and god never wanted them to worship the
[1:02:23] brazen serpent
[1:02:27] god wanted them to worship him
[1:02:30] god gave the commandment to have a
[1:02:33] brazen serpent
[1:02:36] and that was the manifested word for
[1:02:38] that day
[1:02:41] the the the bite of the fiery serpents
[1:02:44] was because of the murmuring and
[1:02:45] complaining it was a judgment of god
[1:02:47] but when god brought a judgment he also
[1:02:49] brought an atonement
[1:02:51] to save their life and that was the
[1:02:53] brazen serpent and so now
[1:02:55] when they would get bit if they would
[1:02:56] look to that they would live
[1:02:59] and it was a great thing that was done
[1:03:01] in that day and if you were bitten in
[1:03:02] that day and you looked and you lived
[1:03:04] you would have admiration for god and
[1:03:06] thanksgiving for god and for a moses who
[1:03:08] would listen to god and for whoever it
[1:03:10] was that crafted that pole and set it up
[1:03:11] there you would be thankful for the
[1:03:12] whole lot
[1:03:14] but that you would know it wasn't the
[1:03:16] man who made the poll wasn't the man who
[1:03:17] set it up there
[1:03:18] it wasn't moses but it was god
[1:03:21] but a few generations later they get to
[1:03:24] the place
[1:03:25] where they make an idol
[1:03:29] out of the very thing that god commanded
[1:03:31] to be built
[1:03:34] and they they begin to burn incense and
[1:03:36] they begin to worship
[1:03:38] the idol and now the thing that god had
[1:03:42] put in place to save them
[1:03:44] becomes the thing that diverts their
[1:03:46] worship from god
[1:03:47] and diverts their worship to idolatry
[1:03:51] which under idolatry satan is always the
[1:03:53] one being worshipped
[1:03:55] because he's the father of idolatry what
[1:03:58] is idolatry idolatry is worth
[1:04:00] worshiping something you make with your
[1:04:02] own hands
[1:04:04] that you believe represents god
[1:04:07] so what is idolatry idolatry is
[1:04:09] something that you make you craft
[1:04:11] amen that you believe represents
[1:04:14] god and you worship it
[1:04:18] so now they crafted this according to
[1:04:20] the word of the lord but it was crafted
[1:04:21] by a man
[1:04:23] or men put up and then they had saved it
[1:04:26] afterwards like
[1:04:27] because who wants to destroy it i mean
[1:04:29] it was wonderful
[1:04:32] so it was the problem was never the
[1:04:34] brazen serpent
[1:04:37] the problem was their approach to the
[1:04:39] brazen serpent
[1:04:42] the brazen serpent was never evil
[1:04:47] oh i hope you catch this it's going to
[1:04:49] mean so much to you
[1:04:52] you can't fault the brazen serpent
[1:04:56] the problem wasn't the brazen serpent
[1:04:59] the problem was the heart of the people
[1:05:05] who wanted to worship the brazen serpent
[1:05:11] brother bam says and the god who is rich
[1:05:14] in mercy
[1:05:16] first i'd like to make this note it just
[1:05:17] comes to my heart
[1:05:20] there was a group of people that were
[1:05:22] beginning to worship brother branham
[1:05:23] as jesus christ baptizing in his name
[1:05:27] praying in his name
[1:05:28] worshiping him it was never brother
[1:05:31] branham's fault
[1:05:36] he was commissioned by god his gifts
[1:05:39] were
[1:05:39] ordained by god the works in his life
[1:05:42] were the vindication of god
[1:05:44] amen he was in his place in his supposed
[1:05:46] duty doing what god was supposed to do
[1:05:47] he struck out against that he condemned
[1:05:49] it but it continued going on
[1:05:52] it was not his fault it was the
[1:05:55] fault of the worshiper
[1:05:59] just like it wasn't moses's fault
[1:06:02] for making the brazen serpent it wasn't
[1:06:06] uh uh the brazen serpent's fault and it
[1:06:08] wasn't god's fault
[1:06:11] it was the worshiper's fault because
[1:06:14] they approached it with the wrong
[1:06:16] attitude with the wrong amount of
[1:06:19] reverence with the
[1:06:22] wrong approach and the wrong mental
[1:06:24] thinking
[1:06:26] they were deceived into worshiping the
[1:06:28] brazen serpent
[1:06:30] in in in this generation they were
[1:06:32] deceived into worshiping brother branham
[1:06:36] and that spirit continues on because
[1:06:38] spirits don't die
[1:06:42] spirits don't die so there's still those
[1:06:44] out there that worship william branham
[1:06:49] and so i also like to say this
[1:06:54] because it just comes to me if you
[1:06:56] listen to dawson reilly's testimony
[1:06:58] dawson reilly it says that one day
[1:07:01] brother branham was talking to him and
[1:07:02] explaining that there was people that
[1:07:03] were baptizing in his name
[1:07:06] and and brother branham was coming
[1:07:07] against that he was just sharing that
[1:07:08] with dawson reilly and this isn't
[1:07:10] dawson's testimony
[1:07:11] and dawson said he says you know i
[1:07:14] thought oh wow how could they do that
[1:07:16] and brother branham looked at him and
[1:07:17] says dawson they're not as far off as
[1:07:19] you think.
[1:07:21] and dawson said well i thought they was
[1:07:23] pretty far off
[1:07:26] see it's a razor's edge because it was
[1:07:28] jesus christ the son of man
[1:07:30] in that son of man but it wasn't the son
[1:07:34] of man the flesh of that son of man
[1:07:36] amen it was jesus christ himself in
[1:07:39] that son of man so i believe to me
[1:07:42] that's why brother abraham could say
[1:07:43] they're not as far off as you think
[1:07:45] amen they found the place of jesus
[1:07:48] christ
[1:07:49] but they've mistook the vessel that he's
[1:07:51] using for him
[1:07:54] they got it confused and what they did
[1:07:56] is they entered into idolatry
[1:08:01] and they began using the vessel that god
[1:08:03] they began worshiping the vessel that
[1:08:05] god was using
[1:08:06] instead of worshiping the god that was
[1:08:08] using the vessel
[1:08:12] and so that's the spirit of idolatry and
[1:08:15] like i said
[1:08:16] satan is behind all idolatry he's the
[1:08:18] one who's actually being worshipped
[1:08:20] because jesus christ cannot receive that
[1:08:22] kind of worship
[1:08:24] worshipping a man the devil's the only
[1:08:26] one who can receive that
[1:08:30] so let me keep reading here and the god
[1:08:33] who is rich in mercy
[1:08:36] now that's just the same thing i think
[1:08:37] that's happened to our church ages god
[1:08:39] sent us a message of martin luther
[1:08:41] with his message john wesley the
[1:08:43] pentecostal message
[1:08:44] but what did we do with it the very same
[1:08:47] thing that they did with the brass
[1:08:48] serpent we idolized it
[1:08:51] i belong to this and i belong to that
[1:08:56] listen we made it an idol
[1:08:59] by membership
[1:09:03] you see you belong to something without
[1:09:06] the sincerity that's connected with
[1:09:07] genuine godly worship
[1:09:09] of the word i'm going to repeat that
[1:09:12] phrase because it's god that's the
[1:09:14] phrase that's got to sink in
[1:09:16] you belong to this i belong to that you
[1:09:18] see you belong to something without the
[1:09:20] sincerity that's connected with
[1:09:22] genuine godly worship of
[1:09:25] the word
[1:09:29] what happened the bible we are told in
[1:09:30] the bible that the prophet took that
[1:09:32] idol and destroyed it hallelujah
[1:09:35] what we need on the scene today is a
[1:09:36] prophet that will destroy the idol of
[1:09:38] denominations
[1:09:40] that thinks they're going into heaven
[1:09:41] upon belonging to some creed
[1:09:43] or denomination needs to be destroyed
[1:09:45] and burn up
[1:09:46] throw it away god is full of mercy he is
[1:09:48] rich in mercy
[1:09:50] in the day that when we would have all
[1:09:52] been in that chaos of darkness out there
[1:09:54] but god
[1:09:55] rich in mercy has sent us the real
[1:09:57] genuine holy ghost with his own
[1:09:59] interpretation to it
[1:10:00] right here in the building every night
[1:10:02] god rich in his mercy
[1:10:04] how wonderful we find him to be yes sir
[1:10:07] now all they thought they could do was
[1:10:09] just to go to the snake
[1:10:11] or this little thing that god had made
[1:10:13] out there and moses to make and
[1:10:15] hang on a pole and they could be healed
[1:10:17] without any sincerity
[1:10:20] they stood and looked at it and they got
[1:10:21] to idolizing it
[1:10:23] and god sent a prophet along and
[1:10:24] destroyed it now all that refused to
[1:10:27] look at that serpent in the wilderness
[1:10:28] they perished
[1:10:30] now god makes a way but if you refuse to
[1:10:32] look at it if you will
[1:10:33] sit across the street if you hold on to
[1:10:35] some creed or refuse to look straight
[1:10:37] into the word and see whether it's right
[1:10:38] or not
[1:10:39] all that refuses to look they perished
[1:10:41] and god is never
[1:10:42] changing a never-changing god and all
[1:10:45] who refuse to look perished
[1:10:46] so is it today the same thing then the
[1:10:50] people
[1:10:50] sinned later and as they always did and
[1:10:53] made the idol
[1:10:54] out of it making it trying to get
[1:10:57] healing without sincerity
[1:10:59] and they belong to something and the way
[1:11:01] we do it today
[1:11:02] and now we see then the difference of it
[1:11:04] was see
[1:11:05] it was a good atonement and a good sign
[1:11:08] for that time
[1:11:10] that time it was all right but it was
[1:11:12] just to be for that time for that
[1:11:14] journey
[1:11:15] that's all it would work for that
[1:11:16] journey and the message
[1:11:18] that martin luther brought of
[1:11:19] justification was all right for luther's
[1:11:21] age
[1:11:22] that's as far as it went sanctification
[1:11:25] was fine in wesley's age that's as far
[1:11:26] as it went
[1:11:27] then we come into the pentecostal age
[1:11:29] and the restoration of the gifts is a
[1:11:30] very fine thing
[1:11:32] it was fine in the age but we are going
[1:11:34] beyond that now
[1:11:35] we are beyond that just as sure as
[1:11:37] there's a world we've got to become
[1:11:39] beyond
[1:11:40] this thing because we have done the same
[1:11:42] thing with it that they did before
[1:11:44] make an idol out of it i belong to this
[1:11:47] order of it
[1:11:48] i belong to that order of it i don't
[1:11:50] want you to think denominations now i
[1:11:52] want you to think what's gone
[1:11:54] on in the deception all around us when
[1:11:57] people take the wrong approach
[1:12:01] the wrong approach to the things of god
[1:12:06] i belong to this order of it i belong to
[1:12:08] that order of it
[1:12:09] god will send somebody that will smash
[1:12:11] the thing and tear it to pieces and
[1:12:12] confirm his word the full word
[1:12:15] praise be to god now we see that's the
[1:12:17] true god rich
[1:12:19] in his mercy this is the thing we have
[1:12:22] to guard against in ourselves
[1:12:25] taking what god set up and what god's
[1:12:27] structuring what god gave
[1:12:28] and make an idol out of it
[1:12:34] in satan's eid in 1965 and that's why
[1:12:36] satan has done this
[1:12:38] and he has worked through the ministry
[1:12:40] to do it as god promised he would do
[1:12:42] now he began by a religious deceit in
[1:12:44] eden and has continued ever since
[1:12:47] not by setting up a bunch of communist
[1:12:49] communists has nothing to do with this
[1:12:51] it's the church that's where you have to
[1:12:53] watch see
[1:12:54] it's not the communists that would
[1:12:56] deceive the very elect it's the church
[1:12:58] that'll deceive the very elect
[1:13:01] see it isn't communist we know they deny
[1:13:04] god and their antichrist sure they are
[1:13:05] in principle but they're not the
[1:13:07] antichrist
[1:13:08] the antichrist is religious very
[1:13:09] religious and can quote the scripture
[1:13:11] and make it look so plain
[1:13:19] let's go to second corinthians together
[1:13:42] god in this day has spared us
[1:13:45] from denominationalism
[1:13:48] and he is he has exposed
[1:13:50] denominationalism and he has separated
[1:13:52] us from denominational spirits
[1:13:55] but we have to be wary that those
[1:13:57] spiritual influences don't creep back in
[1:13:59] on us
[1:14:00] that we allow the word to keep them at
[1:14:02] bay
[1:14:03] and don't let those attitudes and
[1:14:05] approaches brother chad we would never
[1:14:07] start a denomination
[1:14:08] we wouldn't start a denomination with a
[1:14:09] headquarters and a title and a charter
[1:14:11] and
[1:14:11] all of this but that same approach that
[1:14:14] same
[1:14:15] attitude that same spirit that would
[1:14:17] cause us to
[1:14:18] look upon the things that god has done
[1:14:20] and the things that god has said in
[1:14:21] order
[1:14:22] and look upon them wrong
[1:14:25] and we could fall by the same trap
[1:14:31] in second corinthians chapter 4
[1:14:35] verse 3 paul says but if our gospel be
[1:14:38] hid it is hid to them that are lost
[1:14:41] in whom the god of this world hath
[1:14:42] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:14:44] not
[1:14:45] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[1:14:47] christ who is the image of god
[1:14:49] should shine unto them this
[1:14:53] this is where brother ben takes his text
[1:14:55] for the god of this evil age
[1:14:58] in whom the god of this world hath
[1:15:00] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:15:02] lot
[1:15:02] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[1:15:04] christ who is the image of god should
[1:15:05] shine unto them
[1:15:06] for we preach not ourselves but christ
[1:15:08] jesus the lord and ourselves your
[1:15:10] servants
[1:15:11] for jesus saying for god who commanded
[1:15:13] the light to shine out of darkness has
[1:15:15] shined in our hearts
[1:15:16] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:15:17] the glory of god
[1:15:19] in the face of jesus christ but we have
[1:15:22] this treasure
[1:15:23] in earthen vessels that the excellency
[1:15:25] of the power may be of god
[1:15:27] and not of us this is a religious day
[1:15:31] and in this religious day satan is the
[1:15:33] worship person of this age
[1:15:36] and he is blinded the mind the god of
[1:15:39] this world has blinded the minds of the
[1:15:41] people
[1:15:41] so that the light of the gospel won't
[1:15:43] penetrate and how has he done it
[1:15:46] he has done it through religion
[1:15:49] that's how he's done it that's the
[1:15:51] tactic
[1:15:53] brother there says and satan's eaten
[1:15:54] again now by
[1:15:56] unbelief in no taking all the word of
[1:15:58] god has brought a seed of unbelief
[1:16:01] unholy sinful hatred and eternal death
[1:16:03] in this sinful
[1:16:04] intellectual church age now you got it
[1:16:08] in this day
[1:16:09] what when the world is religious do you
[1:16:11] know the whole world is religious
[1:16:13] and in this religious age big churches
[1:16:15] on every corner everything the whole
[1:16:17] thing winds up in satan
[1:16:19] being worshipped and all the religion
[1:16:25] it winds up in satan being worshiped
[1:16:30] i don't want that kind of religion
[1:16:34] i want to come through the judgment of
[1:16:35] the word through the atonement of the
[1:16:38] blood
[1:16:39] into a restored relationship and
[1:16:40] fellowship with my god
[1:16:43] i don't want religion i don't want
[1:16:46] formalism i don't want all the traps of
[1:16:49] the denomination
[1:16:50] i want all of that stripped away by the
[1:16:52] word of the word of god that he's
[1:16:53] brought to us in this hour
[1:16:54] to strip it all away so see it doesn't
[1:16:58] matter
[1:16:59] i'd say it this way i don't know how to
[1:17:02] say it without saying it
[1:17:03] but try to get what i mean because i'm
[1:17:05] going to say things
[1:17:06] that are wrong if you take it the wrong
[1:17:08] way but it doesn't matter what church
[1:17:10] you sit
[1:17:11] in now you say that brother chad it
[1:17:14] doesn't matter
[1:17:15] it doesn't matter what church you said
[1:17:16] in i mean you got to go to a good church
[1:17:19] you've got to go where they believe the
[1:17:20] truth i mean
[1:17:21] you know what i mean but you
[1:17:24] you'd say you got the best church with
[1:17:26] the perfect doctor and everything's
[1:17:27] right which none of that exists but i
[1:17:28] mean
[1:17:30] but let's just say we have it somewhere
[1:17:32] we all go to that church
[1:17:35] it's it doesn't matter what church you
[1:17:37] go to
[1:17:39] if your approach to that church is wrong
[1:17:43] you can make that church your idol and
[1:17:46] you can begin to worship the church
[1:17:48] and not the truth
[1:17:52] just like their approach to william
[1:17:54] branham he was the right messenger for
[1:17:56] the age he was correct
[1:17:58] but sitting there didn't do them any
[1:18:00] good because they had a wrong spirit
[1:18:02] and the wrong spirit gave him the wrong
[1:18:03] approach to that man and his gift
[1:18:07] and it pushed him into idolatry
[1:18:12] and so that's why i want to say the
[1:18:13] idolatry of the church
[1:18:15] i don't want you to think i'm talking
[1:18:16] about i mean the truth there's a true
[1:18:19] church the bride the called out ones
[1:18:20] amen but i'm talking about the whole
[1:18:23] structure
[1:18:24] amen that paul set up
[1:18:28] and that brother branham confirmed
[1:18:32] attending church having a song service
[1:18:34] having preacher closing songs
[1:18:37] there's a structure right gathering on
[1:18:40] the first day of the week
[1:18:41] even a midweek service
[1:18:46] reading the prayer requests from the
[1:18:47] platform so
[1:18:49] all of that's fine paul was the one who
[1:18:51] was first established at church brother
[1:18:52] branham came in and confirmed it
[1:18:54] amen and we want to be correct to that
[1:18:56] but if you come to that with the wrong
[1:18:58] approach
[1:18:58] amen because the devil used the brazen
[1:19:01] serpent that he told moses to build
[1:19:03] amen to bring a deception and idolatry
[1:19:05] in the hearts of the people
[1:19:08] and this devil got into the law of moses
[1:19:10] and he got into the priesthood that god
[1:19:12] established with the law that god had
[1:19:13] brought
[1:19:14] and he turned it into idolatry where
[1:19:16] they began to worship
[1:19:17] the religion and not worship the god who
[1:19:21] gave the
[1:19:22] the form and structure and order they
[1:19:25] began to worship the temple
[1:19:27] and not the god in the temple
[1:19:30] because when god left the temple at the
[1:19:33] crucifixion or at the baptism i believe
[1:19:35] at the baptism of jesus christ there was
[1:19:36] no longer a shekinah glory back there
[1:19:38] because
[1:19:38] because john the baptist saw it come
[1:19:40] upon jesus
[1:19:42] so when he finally ripped that apart
[1:19:44] when jesus christ was on the cross it
[1:19:46] showed that there was no shekinah glory
[1:19:48] there but they weren't interested in
[1:19:49] worshiping the shankara glory they had
[1:19:51] so
[1:19:52] idolized the temple in the jewish
[1:19:54] religion that the priests could go
[1:19:56] secretly
[1:19:57] and stitch up that curtain knowing god's
[1:20:00] not there
[1:20:00] and continue worshiping
[1:20:05] that's the power of idolatry
[1:20:10] that so formed a structure and a system
[1:20:13] that
[1:20:13] god had said god set the feast days
[1:20:17] god set the calendar god set the proper
[1:20:19] sacrifices god sent the priesthood
[1:20:21] god instituted all of these things god
[1:20:23] gave the word god brought moses god
[1:20:25] vindicated moses
[1:20:26] god did all of these things he anointed
[1:20:29] the priesthood
[1:20:30] he did all of that but then the devil
[1:20:32] got in where god was working
[1:20:35] and began to bring a perversion that
[1:20:38] doesn't mean there wasn't still truth
[1:20:39] there that doesn't mean there wasn't
[1:20:40] still
[1:20:40] elect there but again to bring a
[1:20:44] perversion because these vines are
[1:20:45] intertwined
[1:20:48] and when he brings a perversion in then
[1:20:51] he diverts worship from god
[1:20:54] to the thing that god ordered
[1:20:59] see how deceptive see how close
[1:21:03] they begin to worship the tabernacle
[1:21:07] but the tabernacle was a reflection of
[1:21:08] one in heaven
[1:21:11] and they were to worship the god who was
[1:21:13] making his presence known among them
[1:21:15] through the existence of a tabernacle he
[1:21:18] was trying to bring himself into their
[1:21:20] midst
[1:21:20] so that they would look at that
[1:21:22] tabernacle and they would recognize
[1:21:24] god is in our midst and they would
[1:21:25] worship the god in their midst
[1:21:27] but they the satan under idolatry
[1:21:29] convinced them to stop worshiping the
[1:21:31] god in her midst and start worshiping
[1:21:34] the temple
[1:21:37] to where god can remove his presence
[1:21:41] and it doesn't stop the worship
[1:21:46] because the worship wasn't about any
[1:21:48] more worshipping the present god
[1:21:51] it was about worshiping the thing that
[1:21:52] god ordered
[1:21:57] see if you look at our whole structure
[1:21:58] of church which is nothing
[1:22:00] don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong
[1:22:01] we're not doing anything wrong
[1:22:04] but you even look at we have a
[1:22:07] consecrated place
[1:22:09] that we don't allow anything to take
[1:22:11] place in this sanctuary there's no
[1:22:12] running around
[1:22:13] no frolicking not even loud talking
[1:22:15] between services we keep the doors shut
[1:22:17] and
[1:22:17] keep it keep it reverent reverence
[1:22:19] secretary brother graham taught us to do
[1:22:20] that there's nothing wrong with that
[1:22:23] referencing the secretary because this
[1:22:25] is the place we come together to worship
[1:22:27] god
[1:22:27] and we want to keep the atmosphere
[1:22:29] correct
[1:22:30] but we can move from referencing the
[1:22:33] sanctuary to almost
[1:22:34] idolizing the sanctuary like this then
[1:22:38] becomes the only place to talk to god
[1:22:41] or the best place to talk to god
[1:22:45] you understand what i'm saying we can
[1:22:47] begin to take the wrong approach
[1:22:49] amen to even you know we'd lower our
[1:22:52] voice we don't talk when we're in here
[1:22:53] we stay focused
[1:22:55] even the way the seats are arranged
[1:22:58] look at where the seats are arranged
[1:23:00] there's a central
[1:23:01] focal point and that the central focal
[1:23:04] point is an elevated platform
[1:23:07] that's not wrong brother branham had it
[1:23:08] said the same way so i'm
[1:23:10] it's not i'm not saying it's wrong but
[1:23:12] our approach to it can be wrong
[1:23:13] we can come with the wrong attitude in
[1:23:15] the wrong spirit and come down
[1:23:17] and quiet and reverent and we see
[1:23:19] require then we start the worship
[1:23:20] we raise our hands and we're all focused
[1:23:22] to the elevated platform
[1:23:24] then all of a sudden the man with the
[1:23:26] message the
[1:23:27] man god's called anointing for that day
[1:23:29] he's not he's off site
[1:23:30] and we're in and we're we're building
[1:23:32] and worshiping but now it's time for the
[1:23:33] word to come
[1:23:34] and the man emerges from around behind
[1:23:36] the curtain and comes
[1:23:37] to the focal point and you can see
[1:23:40] without the right spirit
[1:23:42] amen you can begin by the nature of man
[1:23:45] to
[1:23:45] elevate those on the platform
[1:23:51] it's why when you you're sometimes when
[1:23:53] you're raised in truth and you're raised
[1:23:54] around all this and you don't have
[1:23:56] any other uh um thinking or anything to
[1:23:59] break up that thing
[1:24:00] it's become so normal and so routine
[1:24:02] that then we begin to
[1:24:06] we begin to take the wrong approach even
[1:24:08] to the ministry
[1:24:11] or the wrong approach even to the pastor
[1:24:16] not that we're not supposed to have a
[1:24:17] pastor and not that we're not supposed
[1:24:18] to stay in the back room until we come
[1:24:20] out brother bam told us to do that
[1:24:23] so it's not wrong but you can come down
[1:24:25] and you can see how the devil can
[1:24:26] pervert that
[1:24:27] to where you begin to where you begin
[1:24:30] to over value that human being standing
[1:24:34] behind that desk
[1:24:37] not the gift of god not the
[1:24:40] presence of god operating through a gift
[1:24:42] but you begin to overvalue
[1:24:44] that human being
[1:24:47] it's a dangerous place for the minister
[1:24:50] and the congregation
[1:24:54] i can tell you as i've started preaching
[1:24:56] this amen i start realizing
[1:24:58] that that i don't want to do this
[1:25:06] it's put the fear of god in me
[1:25:10] because somebody could take the wrong
[1:25:13] approach
[1:25:14] to you and it's not even your fault like
[1:25:15] they did brother branham
[1:25:17] or you could present yourself in such a
[1:25:19] way to encourage them
[1:25:22] to take the wrong approach and have the
[1:25:25] wrong estimation in the wrong value
[1:25:28] it's such a dangerous place to be that
[1:25:31] we're utterly dependent on the spirit of
[1:25:33] god because as human beings we will fail
[1:25:37] we will ruin everything and what is this
[1:25:40] this is what god established this is
[1:25:42] what
[1:25:43] paul set in place what brother branham
[1:25:44] confirmed amen we're doing the best that
[1:25:46] we know how to do what what has been
[1:25:48] brought to us through the message of the
[1:25:49] hour and through the scriptures so we're
[1:25:51] trying to follow the order that god gave
[1:25:53] but but very quickly you can begin
[1:25:56] worshiping the order and the structure
[1:25:59] and not the god who ordained it
[1:26:04] because the worship person of this age
[1:26:06] is satan and how is he being worshipped
[1:26:09] as the church
[1:26:13] and we're going to say well that's
[1:26:14] baptist that could be somebody who's
[1:26:17] raised in the message has never had an
[1:26:18] experience and views coming to church is
[1:26:20] worshiping god
[1:26:24] now do we worship god we come to church
[1:26:25] yes but coming to church isn't
[1:26:27] automatically worshiping god
[1:26:29] they're not the same thing but we
[1:26:32] worship god when we come to church at
[1:26:34] least that's our desire
[1:26:36] but coming to church is not worshiping
[1:26:38] god singing the songs is not worshiping
[1:26:40] god
[1:26:41] sitting quietly following along in our
[1:26:43] bible reading the scriptures
[1:26:44] is not necessarily worshiping god we
[1:26:46] could do all of that
[1:26:47] and just be worshiping the structure and
[1:26:50] form of the church
[1:26:52] and finding our security
[1:26:55] in the church
[1:26:59] why because it's a message church
[1:27:04] and the wrong approach towards that
[1:27:08] could be completely wrong
[1:27:13] we have to keep christ in focus
[1:27:17] all the time through our songs
[1:27:21] through the way we worship the way we
[1:27:23] approach and the way we come in and the
[1:27:25] way we go out the way we treat one
[1:27:26] another
[1:27:27] the way that we view the gifts the way
[1:27:29] that we even view the elevated platform
[1:27:32] there's an elevated platform so you can
[1:27:34] see me i can see you and you can hear me
[1:27:35] and i
[1:27:36] i can hear your feedback
[1:27:40] it serves a function and there's nothing
[1:27:43] wrong with the function
[1:27:46] but you realize the devil can pervert
[1:27:49] the function
[1:27:52] and bring the wrong approach and the
[1:27:54] wrong approach will start to bring
[1:27:56] spiritual death not life
[1:28:00] because we can start depending on the
[1:28:02] great man who hides in the back and
[1:28:04] comes out with the perfect word
[1:28:07] and because at that man he's my ticket
[1:28:10] to salvation
[1:28:11] i believe everything he says
[1:28:16] we've got to be careful friends you've
[1:28:19] got to be careful and i've got to be
[1:28:20] careful
[1:28:22] we have to be dependent upon god
[1:28:26] the devil can make everything god makes
[1:28:28] for right and he can turn it for evil
[1:28:30] he's a perverter not a creator
[1:28:34] he perverts he doesn't create god
[1:28:36] creates god orders and he perverts god's
[1:28:38] order
[1:28:41] we have to make sure that our mental
[1:28:44] approach is right
[1:28:45] that our worship is directed in the
[1:28:48] right place
[1:28:49] that our confidence is placed in the
[1:28:51] correct thing
[1:28:54] now we should have confidence in one
[1:28:58] another
[1:29:02] but not over confidence
[1:29:05] in one another we should respect and
[1:29:08] honor one another
[1:29:10] but that respect and honor for one
[1:29:12] another should never supersede the word
[1:29:13] of god
[1:29:15] never at any time our respect and
[1:29:19] reverence for the ministry for the gifts
[1:29:20] for the office of pastor and every other
[1:29:22] ministry gift
[1:29:23] song leader musicians and all that there
[1:29:25] should be a respect and a reverence and
[1:29:27] a thanksgiving for those gifts that god
[1:29:28] has sent to the church
[1:29:30] but never over the word of god
[1:29:35] all of our devotion all of our worship
[1:29:37] all of our praise
[1:29:39] is to christ and christ is the word
[1:29:42] the word takes preeminence over
[1:29:43] everything
[1:29:45] and we have to make sure that those old
[1:29:48] denominational spirits don't try to slip
[1:29:51] back in
[1:29:53] in the right order the right structure
[1:29:57] the right place done the right way
[1:30:00] and bring the wrong results
[1:30:09] brother ben says in the revelation of
[1:30:11] jesus christ out of the church age book
[1:30:13] he says now remember this
[1:30:14] christ in the true church is a
[1:30:16] continuation of the book of acts
[1:30:18] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:30:20] that the antichrist spirit would come
[1:30:21] into the church and defile it
[1:30:23] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:30:26] it exposes satan revealing his works
[1:30:28] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:30:31] and the discrediting of god's word right
[1:30:34] down to the time he is cast into the
[1:30:36] lake of fire he fights them
[1:30:37] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:30:39] people get the true revelation of the
[1:30:41] true church
[1:30:42] and what she is what she stands for and
[1:30:45] that she can do the greater works
[1:30:47] she will be an invincible army if they
[1:30:49] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[1:30:52] within the framework of the christian
[1:30:53] church
[1:30:55] there it is friends that's what god has
[1:30:58] given us through the opening of the
[1:30:59] seals
[1:31:01] a revelation of the two spirits within
[1:31:03] the framework of the christian church
[1:31:04] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:31:06] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:31:08] satan will be powerless before her he
[1:31:11] will be as thor
[1:31:12] definitely thwarted today is when christ
[1:31:14] withstood his every effort to gain power
[1:31:16] over him in the desert
[1:31:17] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[1:31:20] it
[1:31:21] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:31:23] gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:31:25] us but we will prevail over them
[1:31:37] praise god i want to read a quote out of
[1:31:42] a message from 1960 the 10 virgins and
[1:31:44] 144 000 jews
[1:31:46] it says all right now during this church
[1:31:48] age oh there's something so beautiful i
[1:31:50] like this so well
[1:31:52] during these church ages there is two
[1:31:53] spirits working almost alike right down
[1:31:55] through here
[1:31:56] one is the denomination the other is the
[1:31:58] holy ghost
[1:32:00] and jesus said they were so close that
[1:32:01] they would deceive the very elect if
[1:32:02] possible
[1:32:04] these two spirits are marking their
[1:32:05] people for future judgment
[1:32:09] satan promises that that he would have
[1:32:11] more than christ and he has
[1:32:13] now watch this real real close now as we
[1:32:16] get to this
[1:32:16] more than it we would we would be
[1:32:18] marking the people many are like eve
[1:32:20] eve just stopped long enough to be
[1:32:22] deceived
[1:32:24] if she hadn't stopped there'd have never
[1:32:26] been no deceiving
[1:32:28] i want you to catch what he's saying now
[1:32:30] she stopped long enough
[1:32:31] to listen to the serpent she stopped
[1:32:34] amen and whatever she was doing
[1:32:36] whatever progress she was making in the
[1:32:37] garden whatever life god had called her
[1:32:39] to she
[1:32:40] stopped long enough just to listen and
[1:32:42] he said she stopped
[1:32:44] if she hadn't stopped there'd never been
[1:32:46] no receiving
[1:32:47] but eve stopped and when she stopped
[1:32:49] that's where she got her deceiving
[1:32:52] instead of pressing on do you follow
[1:32:54] follow me close now
[1:32:56] now listen what he's saying he's not
[1:32:59] just talking about
[1:33:00] just stopping
[1:33:03] to stop moving long enough to hear but
[1:33:06] he said if she would have been pressing
[1:33:08] on pressing
[1:33:11] on in the word pressing on in the
[1:33:12] commandment pressing on in the place she
[1:33:14] was
[1:33:15] amen because pressing on into the real
[1:33:18] revelation of the word
[1:33:22] she didn't press on to the real
[1:33:23] revelation come from god amen she was
[1:33:26] there was a commandment to multiply and
[1:33:27] replenish and before the real revelation
[1:33:29] come from god
[1:33:30] on what to do the serpent came in and he
[1:33:33] began to give her
[1:33:34] his own interpretation
[1:33:38] and instead of pressing on she stopped
[1:33:43] that's what he says and instead of
[1:33:45] pressing on do you follow me follow me
[1:33:46] close now
[1:33:48] the reason that eve was deceived let's
[1:33:50] say it together so i'll be sure you get
[1:33:51] it
[1:33:52] the reason he was deceived she never
[1:33:54] kept the full word of god
[1:33:57] satan quoted it to her but he never told
[1:33:59] her all the truth neither does
[1:34:01] his denomination see but she stayed long
[1:34:04] enough to get part of the word
[1:34:05] and didn't take all the word and that's
[1:34:08] what's the matter today the sleeping
[1:34:09] virgin stayed long enough to get part of
[1:34:11] the word
[1:34:12] but not all the word the deceived church
[1:34:14] stays long enough to get part of the
[1:34:16] word but not all the word
[1:34:17] and they were sincere and honest about
[1:34:19] it eve was deceived the bible said she
[1:34:21] was deceived
[1:34:24] see the sleeping virgin stayed long
[1:34:27] enough to get part of the word
[1:34:29] but not all of the word they didn't
[1:34:31] press on to the full revelation
[1:34:34] that god was going to bring in this day
[1:34:36] and gone through a prophet
[1:34:37] brought the full revelation of the full
[1:34:39] word
[1:34:41] and and i'd like to um
[1:34:44] i'd like to just share from my heart my
[1:34:47] concern
[1:34:48] my concern is that that today
[1:34:52] some are not somewhere stopping with
[1:34:55] part of the word
[1:34:56] but not pressing to the full revelation
[1:34:58] of the full forward
[1:35:01] because we're very versed
[1:35:05] in the fact that god sent a prophet
[1:35:07] according to malachi 4 in revelation 17
[1:35:09] 30 and that the seals were open remember
[1:35:13] we realized
[1:35:14] that that was the forerunner ministry
[1:35:17] and the forerunner ministry has
[1:35:19] something that follows the forerunner
[1:35:21] ministry
[1:35:25] and and brother branham came in a four
[1:35:28] month ministry and he was four running
[1:35:30] and he was forerunning the bride coming
[1:35:32] of christ
[1:35:35] he was forerunning the bride age amen
[1:35:38] the calling out of laodicea in the bride
[1:35:40] age
[1:35:40] and he was bringing us into an eagle age
[1:35:42] into a bright age
[1:35:43] and he was forerunning the bride coming
[1:35:45] of christ
[1:35:47] but if we don't push all the way into
[1:35:49] the full revelation
[1:35:50] we can stop part way into the revelation
[1:35:53] and come to the forerunner ministry and
[1:35:55] be like the disciples of john
[1:36:00] now there was two disciples of john and
[1:36:03] it was andrew and john
[1:36:04] who when they saw john say this is him
[1:36:09] this is the lamb they left john and they
[1:36:11] begin to follow christ
[1:36:14] just like in our day there was some
[1:36:15] people who when brother branham
[1:36:17] when he says the the angel of the lord
[1:36:19] told me turn it to the right
[1:36:20] and i turned it and said what is it
[1:36:22] that's our lord it's our lord up there
[1:36:24] there was some people who would leave
[1:36:25] the forerunner ministry and come to the
[1:36:27] lord
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:30] i'm not talking about leaving behind
[1:36:31] brother banham but but we didn't come to
[1:36:33] mary brother branham he was the friend
[1:36:35] of the bridegroom
[1:36:37] he was eleazar who was going to bring us
[1:36:39] to meet isaac amen
[1:36:40] and he began to show us that in the air
[1:36:42] between heaven and earth because isaac
[1:36:44] where did isaac meet rebecca
[1:36:46] between heaven and earth so in the air
[1:36:48] between heaven and earth amen there's a
[1:36:50] cloud
[1:36:50] amen that represents the coming of the
[1:36:52] son of man and in that cloud
[1:36:54] is the face of jesus christ and and you
[1:36:56] could look and say
[1:36:57] who is that what is that but eliezer
[1:37:00] said
[1:37:00] that's my master
[1:37:04] and she slid down off of the camel and
[1:37:06] she went running to isaac
[1:37:10] but if we're not careful we can get
[1:37:12] inoculated by enough truth
[1:37:16] that we don't look for the rest of it
[1:37:19] that we don't keep pressing for god to
[1:37:22] continually be unveiling himself to us
[1:37:24] so that we can seem clearer and clearer
[1:37:26] and clearer
[1:37:28] we can come to the ministry of john
[1:37:30] because because
[1:37:31] john was here to point us amen to christ
[1:37:35] but after christ had come and he had
[1:37:37] left and now he was working in and
[1:37:38] through his disciples
[1:37:40] amen paul met some disciples of john who
[1:37:42] were going around and talking about
[1:37:45] jesus christ coming talking about christ
[1:37:50] and see they were still clinging to the
[1:37:52] gospel of john
[1:37:53] because they had they they had missed
[1:37:56] his coming
[1:37:58] and they had to get re-acquainted with
[1:38:00] him in the apostle
[1:38:02] paul because that's where he was then
[1:38:05] he was working in and through the
[1:38:08] apostles in his church
[1:38:11] and see you can see how deception can
[1:38:14] come all around
[1:38:16] us when we can we can mentally
[1:38:19] acknowledge that god's improvement we
[1:38:21] can see those works and we can testify
[1:38:22] that no man can do that
[1:38:24] and he must have been malachi 4 and he
[1:38:26] must have been the fulfillment of
[1:38:27] scripture and that must be right because
[1:38:29] nobody can do that
[1:38:30] and we like the order and the structure
[1:38:31] of the church and we can come
[1:38:33] in under that truth that's absolutely
[1:38:36] truth
[1:38:36] amen that we can sit down and we begin
[1:38:39] we can we can begin to worship under
[1:38:42] that truth
[1:38:44] but reject the rest of the word
[1:38:51] and i don't mean not understand it
[1:38:52] because there's many days the rest of us
[1:38:54] we didn't understand it they mean there
[1:38:56] was more to it that we didn't understand
[1:38:57] and there's still more there
[1:38:59] i believe there's more that god's
[1:39:01] revealing all the time
[1:39:03] but i'm talking about rejecting i'm
[1:39:06] going to hold this and reject that
[1:39:08] and all it is is a further unveiling of
[1:39:10] the same thing
[1:39:13] the message that was given to us and we
[1:39:16] can
[1:39:17] we can turn our church and our worship
[1:39:20] into idolatry
[1:39:25] because we refuse to move on with christ
[1:39:29] and we refuse to walk in the light as he
[1:39:31] is in the light
[1:39:38] and what we can do under that status
[1:39:42] is we can become religious
[1:39:47] i don't want to be religious
[1:39:51] i don't want to church walk
[1:39:54] i want him
[1:39:57] i want him unveiled and i want him more
[1:40:00] unveiled tomorrow than he was today
[1:40:03] and i want to see more of him and more
[1:40:04] of him and more of him and all that he
[1:40:06] wants to show me i want to see
[1:40:08] i'm not satisfied already amen if
[1:40:10] there's more to be had
[1:40:12] is there's more to know if there's more
[1:40:14] he wants to reveal then there's more
[1:40:15] that i want
[1:40:18] it's as if god says there's more i want
[1:40:20] to show you and you say i'm satisfied
[1:40:22] with the portion that i have
[1:40:26] like you get married and after the
[1:40:27] honeymoon amen you sit down and you
[1:40:29] start to talk to your wife and you start
[1:40:31] to say oh man i remember
[1:40:33] back when i was five years old me and my
[1:40:34] dad said uh i don't want to hear that
[1:40:38] why don't i want to reveal myself to you
[1:40:40] no we're already married i don't need to
[1:40:41] know anything else
[1:40:50] you know this flesh is so deceptive you
[1:40:54] know what your flesh wants to do
[1:40:56] find a place to settle down
[1:40:59] quit reaching forth in the spirit
[1:41:01] because it takes a lot of spiritual
[1:41:03] energy
[1:41:04] that's where the first church age failed
[1:41:06] they stopped reaching forth in the
[1:41:07] spirit
[1:41:09] your flesh i'll just say not your flesh
[1:41:12] i'll tell you what my flesh wants
[1:41:16] i want a good pastor and a good church
[1:41:19] and i want a good job
[1:41:20] and i want to play with my kids every
[1:41:22] evening in the backyard and have prayer
[1:41:23] at bedtime and come to church on sunday
[1:41:26] and go back home and that's what i want
[1:41:30] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:41:33] because i want to
[1:41:34] rest under somebody else's
[1:41:36] responsibility
[1:41:42] that's a temptation of the devil
[1:41:46] to come to a place of rest
[1:41:49] under the banner of the church
[1:41:52] because the church is in order we've got
[1:41:54] all the officers we've got a pastor
[1:41:56] i'm coming under rest under the order of
[1:41:59] the church
[1:42:00] we're never to come under rest we're
[1:42:02] walking with him we have to walk with
[1:42:03] him as he's in the light
[1:42:06] we have to daily walk with him we have
[1:42:08] to seek after him like
[1:42:10] like i was preaching on wednesday amen
[1:42:12] we have to pursue after him
[1:42:13] if there's more to be found i want to
[1:42:15] see more
[1:42:17] if there's no more to show i certainly
[1:42:19] don't want to make up more
[1:42:22] you can overreach the wrong way i mean
[1:42:24] you can go over on one side you can the
[1:42:25] other
[1:42:26] but if there's more to be revealed and i
[1:42:28] know there's more to be revealed because
[1:42:29] there's an eternity of discovering god
[1:42:31] so how have we come to the end of it
[1:42:33] friends how we even come to the end of
[1:42:35] the message because the message is
[1:42:37] christ
[1:42:37] how have we come to the end of christ
[1:42:43] i want to keep reaching forth in the
[1:42:45] spirit and not what my flesh wants what
[1:42:47] the outer man wants to find
[1:42:48] a comfortable place to pitch my tent
[1:42:54] and start raising my crops
[1:42:59] that was what that's how the israelites
[1:43:01] failed they drove enough
[1:43:03] demons out to get security
[1:43:08] but they didn't drive them all out just
[1:43:11] enough
[1:43:11] to feel secure
[1:43:15] and then those demons that were left
[1:43:17] those religious spirits that remained
[1:43:18] around them
[1:43:20] they put them under tribute and made a
[1:43:22] deal with them and put them under
[1:43:23] subjection
[1:43:26] and said you religious spirits you can
[1:43:28] only go so far you can't raise up
[1:43:29] anymore
[1:43:32] but the very thing they put in a tribute
[1:43:34] tribute became a prick in their flesh
[1:43:36] and a thorn in their eye
[1:43:37] amen it came back to be the very thing
[1:43:39] that destroyed them
[1:43:41] they should have never stopped until
[1:43:43] every
[1:43:44] thing that god told them to do was done
[1:43:46] until every enemy force was gone
[1:43:50] but what did they wanted they wanted to
[1:43:51] get down to the business of finding
[1:43:53] rest and they wanted to raise their
[1:43:56] crops they wanted to go ahead and plant
[1:43:57] because they wanted to get a big crop
[1:43:58] next year
[1:43:59] i'm going to go ahead and get my sheep
[1:44:01] established i'm going to get my barn
[1:44:02] built i want to secure this
[1:44:03] i'm going to start raising my family and
[1:44:05] i just want
[1:44:07] a place to settle down
[1:44:11] many times that's what a fellowship of
[1:44:13] believers has become just a place where
[1:44:15] somebody just wants to settle
[1:44:23] settle down under a good pastor and we
[1:44:27] have good
[1:44:28] deacons and the church is in order and
[1:44:30] everything is
[1:44:32] everything is just the way i'm
[1:44:34] comfortable with it
[1:44:37] i feel secure and i just want to settle
[1:44:41] down
[1:44:42] and just start going to church
[1:44:45] you don't even realize it but that's the
[1:44:48] very day you stop gaining ground
[1:44:52] it's not wrong to not like your church
[1:44:55] and not enjoy the fellowship
[1:44:56] but if it causes us to stop pressing
[1:44:58] forth
[1:45:00] stop seeking him stop wanting to know
[1:45:02] him more
[1:45:04] the very thing that god uses and god
[1:45:07] is using today for his glory can be the
[1:45:09] very thing that becomes an
[1:45:11] idol we can start worshiping the
[1:45:14] fellowship of the believers we start
[1:45:16] worshipping the church
[1:45:18] and now we're not worshiping the word
[1:45:27] let's turn to matthew 24 24.
[1:45:31] just a couple more scriptures and we'll
[1:45:33] close
[1:45:43] matthew 24 24
[1:45:47] for there shall arise false christ and
[1:45:49] false prophets
[1:45:51] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:45:53] in so much that if it were
[1:45:55] possible say it should deceive the very
[1:45:57] elect
[1:45:59] so these false christs and false
[1:46:03] prophets
[1:46:04] they can show great signs and wonders so
[1:46:07] the great signs and wonders
[1:46:09] great signs and wonders come from god
[1:46:10] and they're part of the experience of
[1:46:12] christianity and part of the true church
[1:46:15] but they can also be used to deceive
[1:46:18] they're right but they can be used for
[1:46:21] wrong
[1:46:23] and it says if it was possible
[1:46:26] they shall deceive the very elect so
[1:46:29] what is it that we're supposed to be
[1:46:31] looking for
[1:46:33] what is it that god's given us to
[1:46:36] protect us what is it to keep us from
[1:46:38] deception what is it
[1:46:39] that god's given us and brother brown
[1:46:42] begins to speak of this
[1:46:43] in the message see the seed is not there
[1:46:45] with the shuck he says no to see how
[1:46:46] close it looks
[1:46:47] matthew said saint matthew 24 24 said
[1:46:49] the two spirits in the last days
[1:46:51] the church spirit of the church people
[1:46:54] and the bride spirit of the bride people
[1:46:59] i'd like to say this you could have
[1:47:02] church people
[1:47:02] and bride people sitting on the same
[1:47:06] road
[1:47:08] make sure we're careful about that
[1:47:12] the the spirit of the church people the
[1:47:15] spirit of
[1:47:16] the church spirit of the church people
[1:47:18] and the bride spirit of the bride people
[1:47:20] would be so close together until it
[1:47:22] would deceive the very elect if it was
[1:47:24] possible
[1:47:25] that's how close
[1:47:33] read this one more scripture with me
[1:47:35] first john i don't know if it'll be the
[1:47:36] last one or not probably not but let's
[1:47:38] read one more
[1:47:40] i didn't mean to be deceptive that was
[1:47:43] an accident
[1:47:45] first john
[1:47:53] first john 4
[1:47:56] and verse 1.
[1:48:01] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[1:48:03] the spirits
[1:48:04] whether they are of god because many
[1:48:06] false prophets are gone out into the
[1:48:08] world
[1:48:09] hereby know you the spirit of god every
[1:48:11] spirit that confesses
[1:48:13] that jesus christ is present tense
[1:48:16] today is come in the flesh is
[1:48:19] of god and every spirit that confesses
[1:48:23] not that jesus christ is come in the
[1:48:24] flesh is not of god
[1:48:26] and this is the spirit of antichrist
[1:48:28] wherever you have heard that it should
[1:48:29] come
[1:48:30] and even now already is it in the world
[1:48:36] the anointed ones at the end time
[1:48:38] brother ben says these trees the true
[1:48:40] vine and the false vine
[1:48:41] you've heard me preach on that since
[1:48:43] from years ago how they've grown up
[1:48:45] together
[1:48:46] brought them in individuals and showed
[1:48:48] that from cain and abel the two vines
[1:48:49] that met at an altar both of them
[1:48:51] religious
[1:48:52] both of them anointed both of them
[1:48:54] desiring life
[1:48:55] catch this both religious both
[1:48:59] anointed
[1:49:02] both desiring life it wasn't like cain's
[1:49:05] worship was dry and dead
[1:49:08] he was anointed like abel was anointed
[1:49:12] and brother branham even said they had
[1:49:14] the same anointing
[1:49:20] anointed both of them desiring life and
[1:49:22] worshipping the same god
[1:49:24] and one was rejected and the other
[1:49:27] received
[1:49:29] and the only way that the one was
[1:49:31] received could have done anything
[1:49:32] different from his brother
[1:49:33] it was revealed to him for the bible
[1:49:36] said by faith hebrews 11 chapter by
[1:49:38] faith abel offered unto god a more
[1:49:40] excellent sacrifice than that of cain
[1:49:42] which god testified that he was
[1:49:44] righteous jesus said the spiritual
[1:49:46] revelation of who
[1:49:48] he was who does man say
[1:49:51] i the son of man am so peter said thou
[1:49:54] art the christ the son of the living god
[1:49:56] blessed art thou simon son of jonas
[1:49:58] flesh and blood never revealed this to
[1:50:00] you
[1:50:00] my father which is in heaven has
[1:50:02] revealed it upon this rock i'll build my
[1:50:04] church
[1:50:05] what the true revelation of the word
[1:50:08] there is the true vine again abled by
[1:50:11] faith
[1:50:12] further down in the same message he says
[1:50:13] the true vine and the false vine
[1:50:15] both had the same anointing
[1:50:20] so you can't go by feeling or anointing
[1:50:27] so the true vine and the false vine both
[1:50:29] had the same anointing
[1:50:30] the water fell on both of them no wonder
[1:50:33] he warned us
[1:50:34] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:50:36] was possible brother branham
[1:50:38] said that the the wheat and the tares
[1:50:40] grew up together and he saw
[1:50:42] the rain coming and then they were both
[1:50:43] in a drought and they needed the word
[1:50:45] amen and their heads were drooped over
[1:50:48] and when the rain
[1:50:49] came the water of the word came he said
[1:50:52] the wheat raised up their head
[1:50:53] and said praise god and the tares raised
[1:50:56] up their heads and said praise god
[1:51:01] they both went home that day and said
[1:51:03] that was a good service
[1:51:10] amen notice they look the same
[1:51:14] they're anointed the same but notice by
[1:51:16] the fruit how do you know it
[1:51:18] how you know that isn't an orange
[1:51:19] because it's bearing grapefruit that
[1:51:21] vine is all right it's living in the
[1:51:22] tree but it's bearing a grapefruit
[1:51:24] it isn't like the first one and if a
[1:51:27] church says they believe jesus christ is
[1:51:28] saying yesterday today and forever and
[1:51:30] deny his power
[1:51:31] deny his works deny his word the church
[1:51:34] that believes in jesus christ will do
[1:51:36] the works of jesus christ
[1:51:37] it'll have the life of jesus christ and
[1:51:39] if it isn't no matter if the life is
[1:51:41] pouring
[1:51:42] into it if it isn't predestinated from
[1:51:44] the roots it'll bear grapefruit every
[1:51:46] time or something different
[1:51:48] but if it's the predestinated life and
[1:51:50] the roots it'll bear
[1:51:51] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:51:54] and forever
[1:51:55] if it's the word coming up through the
[1:51:57] root which he is the root the beginning
[1:51:59] of time
[1:52:00] notice but it's what they produce that
[1:52:04] tells you the difference by the fruit
[1:52:05] jesus said you shall know them
[1:52:07] man does not gather grapes off of a
[1:52:09] thistle even though the thistle be right
[1:52:12] in the grapevine
[1:52:13] they could be possible but the fruit
[1:52:14] will tell it what is the fruit
[1:52:17] the word for the fruit for the season
[1:52:21] what is the fruit remember
[1:52:24] the false anointed ones can do mighty
[1:52:26] signs and wonders
[1:52:30] now is it true that the church will have
[1:52:32] the same work same spirit of christ yes
[1:52:34] same work same spirit same life of jesus
[1:52:36] christ
[1:52:38] but the false vine can do signs and
[1:52:40] wonders but brother branson said what is
[1:52:41] the fruit
[1:52:42] the word for the fruit for the season
[1:52:46] that's what it is their teaching
[1:52:49] the teaching of what the teaching of the
[1:52:52] season
[1:52:53] what time it is
[1:52:58] man's doctrine denominational doctrine
[1:53:00] but or god's word
[1:53:02] for the season where can you tell the
[1:53:06] difference
[1:53:07] the word for the season the teaching
[1:53:10] the anointing's the same the worship can
[1:53:13] be the same
[1:53:14] the desire to worship god worshipping
[1:53:16] the same god
[1:53:17] can all be the same but abel had the
[1:53:19] revelation of the word for his season
[1:53:23] cain couldn't catch that and when abel
[1:53:27] expressed it
[1:53:28] cain became angry and began to persecute
[1:53:30] abel and even killed him because he had
[1:53:32] to stop the voice that exposed his
[1:53:34] nakedness
[1:53:37] because abel had caught the revelation
[1:53:39] of the word for his day
[1:53:41] cain couldn't catch it but but
[1:53:44] cain neither could he conform to it
[1:53:48] so he had to kill it
[1:53:54] let's look at matthew 16.
[1:54:13] matthew 16.
[1:54:23] and 13 matthew 16-13
[1:54:27] when jesus came into the coast of
[1:54:29] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[1:54:31] saying
[1:54:32] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[1:54:35] and
[1:54:36] they said some say thou art john the
[1:54:38] baptist some elias others jeremiah
[1:54:40] are one of the prophets he saith in them
[1:54:43] but whom say ye that i am
[1:54:45] simon peter answered and said thou art
[1:54:47] the christ the son of the living god
[1:54:50] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:54:52] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[1:54:54] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[1:54:56] but my father which is in heaven and i
[1:54:59] say also unto thee
[1:55:00] that thou art peter and upon this rock i
[1:55:03] will build my church
[1:55:04] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:55:07] against it
[1:55:09] what was the revelation the revelation
[1:55:12] of who the present tense christ
[1:55:15] is that's what he built his church upon
[1:55:19] that revelation which didn't come from
[1:55:22] flesh and blood
[1:55:24] but came from the father who's in heaven
[1:55:28] brother ben said christ the mystery of
[1:55:29] god revealed he's not saying my church
[1:55:32] now my church has nothing to do with it
[1:55:36] he said it brother branham said it my
[1:55:39] church has nothing to do with it
[1:55:41] it's an individual one person
[1:55:45] all hell is against this
[1:55:48] teaching what's it against
[1:55:52] it's against the teaching of an
[1:55:54] individual
[1:55:55] one person individually connected to
[1:55:57] christ
[1:55:58] by a revelation of the word for their
[1:56:00] day all hell is against that teaching
[1:56:05] what does hell want another system
[1:56:09] i'm going to say it and i hope that you
[1:56:12] i just
[1:56:13] pray you understand my heart but the
[1:56:17] devil
[1:56:17] can turn your church here
[1:56:22] into a system in your mind
[1:56:28] and it's no longer me in christ but it's
[1:56:30] us in christ
[1:56:33] and the revelation of this hour is not
[1:56:35] us in christ the revelation this hour is
[1:56:37] you in christ and if the devil comes and
[1:56:41] starts to bring
[1:56:42] comfort in the group and brings
[1:56:45] comfort into conformity of the church
[1:56:47] order
[1:56:49] i can act like everybody look back
[1:56:51] everybody attend all the services
[1:56:53] participate in all the functions
[1:56:58] that can be an idol to you
[1:57:04] but the real revelation of this hour
[1:57:08] is the revelation of jesus christ to you
[1:57:10] as an individual
[1:57:12] you and christ as the self-same persons
[1:57:15] together as one
[1:57:18] not us but him and i
[1:57:24] the devil is constantly trying to bring
[1:57:26] it back into us bring security in
[1:57:28] us bring us back into form so that we
[1:57:30] feel secure and everything's okay
[1:57:31] because of all of us
[1:57:33] but god does not want it to be in us he
[1:57:35] wants it to be a
[1:57:36] me i've met christ i know him as my
[1:57:39] savior he's revealed the message to me
[1:57:43] i know who he is i know where he is i
[1:57:45] know the proper place of worship i know
[1:57:46] how to
[1:57:47] i know how to come to the atonement how
[1:57:49] not because some man explained it to me
[1:57:51] but god quickened it in my heart
[1:57:53] i know it's the truth i'm not just going
[1:57:56] along because i'm afraid if i don't i'll
[1:57:57] be lost amen
[1:57:58] amen that is formalism that is
[1:58:00] denominationalism
[1:58:02] i'm not just coming to the message
[1:58:03] because i don't know what else is right
[1:58:04] that's the same problem
[1:58:07] i'm not just going along with the
[1:58:08] message because i can't find something
[1:58:09] better
[1:58:11] because it can't be topped because it's
[1:58:12] the best
[1:58:16] all of that is back to denominational
[1:58:18] thinking
[1:58:20] and i'm not going along with what's said
[1:58:22] and what's taught because
[1:58:23] i'm afraid if i don't i'll be wrong
[1:58:26] that's not it either
[1:58:30] i'm doing what god wants me to do
[1:58:31] because i know this is what he wants me
[1:58:33] to do
[1:58:35] not just because the man in the pulpit
[1:58:37] said it when the man in the pulpit said
[1:58:39] it
[1:58:39] god in my heart quickened it like that i
[1:58:41] saw him in the word and said that's the
[1:58:43] truth
[1:58:43] that's why i do it not just because he
[1:58:46] said it
[1:58:48] if i do it just because he said it i
[1:58:50] could be making an
[1:58:51] idol out of the minister
[1:58:57] but i do it because it's the word of god
[1:58:59] and god's given me a revelation that
[1:59:01] it's the word of god
[1:59:02] and i know this is the message for the
[1:59:04] hour and i know what he's called me to
[1:59:06] and i know who he is
[1:59:08] not because i figured anything out or
[1:59:10] was taught unto me but god
[1:59:12] amen because god when he looked at peter
[1:59:15] peter
[1:59:16] the rest of the disciples their first
[1:59:18] response was well you know
[1:59:20] we think
[1:59:23] some experts say this and some experts
[1:59:25] say that and i heard a preacher say this
[1:59:28] and i heard a brother over here say that
[1:59:29] and sister so-and-so says this
[1:59:33] my mom and dad always said and i've
[1:59:35] always believed and we
[1:59:36] teach in our church
[1:59:43] let that language leave your vocabulary
[1:59:48] it's got to come down
[1:59:52] to this is christ i know this is him
[1:59:57] and i'm joining to him in an invisible
[2:00:00] union because he came to me
[2:00:04] and he can look at you and say blessed
[2:00:06] art thou
[2:00:08] insert your name for flesh and blood has
[2:00:11] not revealed this to you
[2:00:13] but my father which is in heaven has
[2:00:15] revealed it to you
[2:00:16] and upon this rock i will build
[2:00:19] my church the revelation personally
[2:00:23] to you the devil would
[2:00:27] love to take the message and move it
[2:00:28] back into a group
[2:00:32] but the message is christ you can't
[2:00:35] denominate
[2:00:36] christ that doesn't mean people around
[2:00:39] the message can't take it the
[2:00:40] nominational spirit
[2:00:42] absolutely without a doubt but you can't
[2:00:45] denominate
[2:00:46] christ and this message is christ
[2:00:52] you can denominate some man's idea of
[2:00:53] the message
[2:00:56] you can denominate a group's idea of the
[2:00:58] message but you cannot denominate the
[2:01:00] message because the message is christ
[2:01:03] it's the full revelation of the full
[2:01:05] word
[2:01:06] even the parts you don't yet understand
[2:01:09] it's still true
[2:01:16] i'm going to read this again of christ
[2:01:17] is the mystery of god revealed
[2:01:19] my church has nothing to do with it it's
[2:01:21] an individual one person
[2:01:23] all hell is against this teaching all
[2:01:25] hell is against this truth
[2:01:27] but it is the truth jesus never said now
[2:01:30] peter you and john and all the rest of
[2:01:31] the people you've got the revelation
[2:01:33] now the whole church is saved no it was
[2:01:36] to him
[2:01:37] personally i say unto thee thee not them
[2:01:40] to thee thou art peter upon this rock
[2:01:43] i'll build my church
[2:01:45] and the word peter means a stone stone
[2:01:47] means the confessed one or the separated
[2:01:49] one
[2:01:50] upon a certain stone upon a certain
[2:01:52] thing see it called out
[2:01:53] the church called out upon this stone
[2:01:56] upon this revelation
[2:01:57] flesh and blood never revealed it to you
[2:01:59] but upon this revelation
[2:02:01] called out group i'll build my church in
[2:02:03] them and all the gates of hell
[2:02:05] will never be able to withstand it
[2:02:10] why will the gates of hell not withstand
[2:02:12] it because you're super special
[2:02:15] and you're really bright you got a
[2:02:17] strong willpower
[2:02:20] no the gates of hell will never be able
[2:02:21] to withstand the revelation
[2:02:23] because you've got a capacity a
[2:02:26] god-given predestinated capacity to
[2:02:28] catch the revelation of the word
[2:02:30] and the devil can't interrupt that he
[2:02:32] can't stop it amen he can't block the
[2:02:34] transmission amen
[2:02:35] it comes in a frequency he can't stop
[2:02:39] and the word goes forth and revelation
[2:02:40] clicks and revelation clicks and you
[2:02:42] hear the message you read your bible and
[2:02:43] click click click click click and the
[2:02:45] revelation is leading you and guiding
[2:02:47] you into all truth
[2:02:49] and the gates of hell cannot withstand
[2:02:51] that because the gates and hell try to
[2:02:53] infiltrate
[2:02:54] amen try to move in systemize shut down
[2:02:57] and stop the progress of revelation
[2:03:01] but now the gates of heaven cannot
[2:03:03] prevail not because of your strength
[2:03:04] your brightness your
[2:03:05] your education your ability or whatever
[2:03:08] that's no match i mean you are no match
[2:03:11] for the devil and any of the
[2:03:13] the gifts or abilities that you have
[2:03:15] yourself
[2:03:18] but the ability to receive revelation
[2:03:21] is the secret key
[2:03:24] that the devil cannot stop
[2:03:29] and be with revelation in our lives
[2:03:32] the gates of hell will never prevail
[2:03:34] against us
[2:03:36] but we will prevail over them
[2:03:39] because it will be god one step at a
[2:03:42] time
[2:03:43] revelation upon revelation not we
[2:03:46] but me
[2:03:50] you as an individual me as an individual
[2:03:54] god leading us by his word
[2:03:57] and what's going to be amazing is you as
[2:04:00] an individual
[2:04:00] me as an individual and others as
[2:04:02] individuals are going to wind up in the
[2:04:04] same plot
[2:04:05] spot someday not because we did it
[2:04:08] together not because we relied on
[2:04:10] one another not because we got
[2:04:11] comfortable in the group or we all went
[2:04:13] together
[2:04:14] but because individually he led us all
[2:04:17] and we all went to the same place
[2:04:22] i don't want religion
[2:04:26] i don't want a comfort that comes from
[2:04:27] participation
[2:04:30] is participation required if you believe
[2:04:32] the word
[2:04:36] can you forsake the assembling and
[2:04:38] together yourselves
[2:04:40] no that's the word
[2:04:44] can you assemble for the wrong comfort
[2:04:47] and make an idol out of your assembly
[2:04:54] participation if you believe the word
[2:04:56] you participate
[2:04:57] you believe the word you pay your tithes
[2:04:58] if you participate you come to church
[2:05:00] and show your support what brother ben
[2:05:02] said you respond to the word you
[2:05:06] we do all the things that we're told to
[2:05:07] do
[2:05:09] but the deception of the devil will try
[2:05:10] to come in and make participation
[2:05:13] equal to an experience
[2:05:17] and make participation in the order of
[2:05:19] the church equal to salvation
[2:05:23] and you can't draw that equal sign
[2:05:27] because by grace you're saved through
[2:05:30] faith
[2:05:32] and that not of yourselves it is the
[2:05:34] gift of god
[2:05:36] and works is faith expressed
[2:05:42] works can't produce faith
[2:05:46] you can't get it backwards jesus didn't
[2:05:49] say go build a church and invite
[2:05:50] everybody into the church he said go
[2:05:52] preach the gospel
[2:05:52] those that believe will be baptized and
[2:05:54] i'll send paul later to set up the
[2:05:55] church
[2:05:58] you've got to come to christ first and
[2:06:01] repent
[2:06:02] you've got to come by faith and then the
[2:06:05] order of the church
[2:06:06] you begin to express your faith by
[2:06:09] obedience
[2:06:10] to the word of god but your obedience to
[2:06:14] the word of god will never
[2:06:16] produce faith faith produces
[2:06:19] your obedience you can obey but that
[2:06:22] won't guarantee faith
[2:06:24] works is faith expressed
[2:06:28] grace is what god did for me works is
[2:06:32] what i do to show my love
[2:06:33] for him amen let's all stand
[2:06:37] musicians if you come brother john if
[2:06:38] you make your way up
[2:06:44] i pray that god will place into your
[2:06:47] heart
[2:06:48] what he was dealing with me on and that
[2:06:51] you won't misunderstand what i'm saying
[2:06:53] because it's a razor's edge friends
[2:06:56] you could find yourself saying things
[2:06:58] too harshly and being against the very
[2:07:00] thing that god established
[2:07:02] and that god wants to use he wants us to
[2:07:05] gather in fellowship he wants us to have
[2:07:06] a church he wants an order and structure
[2:07:08] to service
[2:07:08] he wants everything to be done decently
[2:07:10] and in order
[2:07:12] so you can strike too hard against
[2:07:13] something and be absolutely against the
[2:07:15] word of god
[2:07:16] but you can take it the other way and
[2:07:18] you can have all the order without
[2:07:20] christ and you can be absolutely on the
[2:07:21] wrong road there
[2:07:24] we've got to come to an individual
[2:07:27] revelation
[2:07:29] jesus christ revealed personally to you
[2:07:33] a relationship that nobody else can
[2:07:36] share with you
[2:07:37] you have to have a relationship your
[2:07:39] spouse can't share with you
[2:07:43] it sounds horrible but it's the truth
[2:07:45] you have to have a relationship with
[2:07:46] christ
[2:07:47] your spouse can't share that
[2:07:49] relationship with you
[2:07:50] because it's an individual you can
[2:07:52] worship together you can serve god
[2:07:54] together
[2:07:55] but that spouse can't share that
[2:07:57] personal intimate
[2:07:58] in your soul relationship with you and
[2:08:00] god
[2:08:02] that's what god wants he wants the
[2:08:04] relationship he's not after the religion
[2:08:08] he created angels to worship him he
[2:08:10] doesn't need your religious service
[2:08:13] what he wants is your fellowship
[2:08:16] what he wants is the relationship of his
[2:08:18] attributes
[2:08:19] back together again the seals came open
[2:08:24] to strip the nominational spirits away
[2:08:27] to reveal
[2:08:28] the error so that this bride won't fall
[2:08:30] into the same trap
[2:08:32] and i say thank you god thank you
[2:08:36] god and it's going to be his strength
[2:08:39] and his word and his revelation that
[2:08:42] keeps us
[2:08:43] we won't keep ourselves
[2:08:46] stay under the washing of the water of
[2:08:48] the word and let the washing of the
[2:08:50] water of the word
[2:08:51] wash all of the stain of the prostitute
[2:08:53] spirits away
[2:08:55] and all that's been picked up through
[2:08:57] carnality and life and
[2:08:59] 2000 years of christianity let it all be
[2:09:01] washed away
[2:09:03] to all that's left is you and him
[2:09:07] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[2:09:10] we thank you for this day
[2:09:12] father i pray and i trust lord that you
[2:09:15] know my heart
[2:09:17] you know the desire and the things that
[2:09:19] you laid on my heart to say
[2:09:22] god if i've said any of them wrong
[2:09:23] forgive me lord you know my heart and i
[2:09:25] don't want to
[2:09:27] i don't want to be too strong one way or
[2:09:29] too strong the other i don't
[2:09:31] i don't want to trouble anybody in their
[2:09:33] mind lord but i want to present your
[2:09:35] word
[2:09:36] the way you presented it to me i want to
[2:09:38] be faithful to the calling wherewith you
[2:09:40] called me
[2:09:41] and i want to speak the truth and love
[2:09:45] god i pray you take these words no
[2:09:47] matter how they were said i pray that
[2:09:49] you plant them correctly in the hearts
[2:09:50] of your people
[2:09:52] that you would keep us from religious
[2:09:54] spirits
[2:09:55] that you would keep us free from
[2:09:57] idolatry lord
[2:09:58] that we would never be guilty of taking
[2:10:00] something you've given for our benefit
[2:10:03] and allow it to be perverted to
[2:10:05] something else
[2:10:06] god keep us our focus centered on you
[2:10:10] god may we find our satisfaction
[2:10:14] in that quiet time in our relationship
[2:10:17] with you and the revelation you give to
[2:10:19] us personally
[2:10:21] may we be satisfied with the portion
[2:10:23] you've given us may we look forward
[2:10:26] to more of you may every other
[2:10:28] distraction be laid aside and every
[2:10:30] perversion of the devil be exposed
[2:10:33] may we come to a reality lord
[2:10:37] past all the fake past the
[2:10:41] pass the religiousness past everything
[2:10:45] and may we get to the reality lord
[2:10:48] the truth that you're trying to give to
[2:10:50] us in this day
[2:10:52] the restoration of a relationship
[2:10:54] between a bride and a bridegroom
[2:10:56] an invisible union a marriage a
[2:10:58] conception on the word
[2:10:59] and a bringing forth of the son of man
[2:11:03] may it all lord take place in us as
[2:11:06] individuals may we lay ourselves bare
[2:11:08] may we come to you in a real genuine way
[2:11:11] may we find you when we seek you with
[2:11:13] all of our hearts
[2:11:15] god i pray that you would touch your
[2:11:17] children should bring
[2:11:18] personal individual revelation to each
[2:11:22] one

[2:11:25] this church or raised in the message
[2:11:27] i pray you come to them in an individual
[2:11:29] way lord
[2:11:30] that they would have an experience where
[2:11:32] they've connected with you and they know
[2:11:33] it lord
[2:11:34] that something inside of them would
[2:11:36] change in a way
[2:11:37] that they would know it lord that they
[2:11:39] would know that this is not mom and
[2:11:40] dad's religion anymore

[2:11:55] a new birth lord
[2:11:57] that you would quicken them to life that
