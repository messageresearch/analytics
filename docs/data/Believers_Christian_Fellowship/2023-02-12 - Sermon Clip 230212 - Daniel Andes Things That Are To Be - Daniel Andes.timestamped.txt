[0:00] and as a Christian you have to keep life
[0:02] inside of you and I was thinking about
[0:03] this because this sister
[0:05] tells us she was from Siberia
[0:08] and it gets really cold up there Moldova
[0:10] in there and they'd gone to Russia I
[0:12] think she was born there sister Kia she
[0:14] was telling me the story one day she was
[0:15] coming home from school and she got
[0:16] really tired
[0:17] and it's so cold up there we were up
[0:19] there in Saskatchewan it was minus 36
[0:23] degrees I don't know how people do it
[0:26] I tell I told him I said you know the
[0:28] first thing I'm going to tell Eve when I
[0:30] see Eve I say Eve whatever they tell you
[0:32] do it you don't know what 30 negative 36
[0:35] degrees is you broke the rules now it's
[0:38] the curse it's just so it was so cold
[0:40] and so now this Kia she's talking about
[0:42] living in in Siberia and it was so cold
[0:44] and she she one day she she was coming
[0:46] home from school and she just sat down
[0:47] by the road and she got tired she sat
[0:49] down and just rested and she was just
[0:51] resting she got home she told her mom
[0:53] said Mom I was so tired and so cold
[0:55] coming I just sat down by the side and
[0:57] her mother looked at her said don't you
[0:58] ever
[0:59] don't you ever sit down by the side of
[1:03] the road in that cold weather because
[1:04] that's the first sign of freezing to
[1:07] death and dying and I'm here to tell you
[1:09] we live in a generation where it's
[1:11] becoming cold
[1:12] amen and we see the Revival and it's
[1:15] getting cold don't ever ever sit down
[1:18] along the road somewhere and say I'm
[1:20] just going to rest right here because
[1:22] it's death it's the signs of death you
[1:25] keep going to church you keep lifting up
[1:27] your hands amen and Mary when you when
[1:29] you get cold really say you start
[1:31] rubbing your hand I mean you create your
[1:33] own heat amen you start rubbing and I
[1:35] might have to clap my hands I might have
[1:36] I might even have to shout a little bit
[1:38] what are you doing I'm keeping life in
[1:41] me I refuse to get cold and Lady you'll
[1:44] see a hot or cold
[1:46] amen hot or cold say Lord I want to be
[1:49] hot for you I don't care what people
[1:51] think I don't care if they think I'm a
[1:52] fanatic I'm alive
[1:55] I'm alive
[1:56] I don't know they feel like well I don't
[1:58] know I'm alive being my birthday I'll be
[2:01] 55 years now I'm alive I've been married
[2:04] 35 years you know ups and down like I'm
[2:06] married

[2:10] some mistakes along the way but this
[2:11] message works and it's the Gospel of
[2:13] Jesus Christ and I'm not ashamed of the
[2:15] Gospel it works

[2:18] going to keep pressing on maybe there's
[2:20] somebody streaming here this morning
