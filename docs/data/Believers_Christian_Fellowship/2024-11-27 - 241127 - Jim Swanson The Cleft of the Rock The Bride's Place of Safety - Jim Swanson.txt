Brother JD I got a chance to meet him on Sunday we had never met before but he's originally from the Congo and he's now a student in Tulsa Oklahoma he's also a fifth grade science teacher and a student and so he's been without Fellowship since he's come from Congo for 22 months and he drove all the way out here just to have some fellowship and so we met with him and talked with him Sunday and he's been visiting different ones and so it's been good to have you God bless you thank you for being here with us amen also we sent out um information today you should have all received it also on the bulletin boards concerning the funeral for sister Jen golden next week also there'll be a funeral dinner after the graveside service and if anybody if any of the ladies would like to make desserts or anybody would like to contribute desserts for that it'd be appreciated and you can do so and uh just bring them you can even bring them to Sunday or bring them uh the day of the funeral as well also I've decided to cancel next Wednesday service because we're going to have the funeral here we're going to have then go to the gravide and come back and I'd like to just instead of rushing instead of being in a hurry I'd like for all those who want to be here to be here and I'd like to focus our attention on the golden family they've been a part of this church from the foundation from the very beginning and they're very foundational to all of us and so we want to just uh give them our love and our attention and not be in a hurry amen I'm excited to have brother Jim Swanson Minister for us this evening Amen brother Jim had been ministering since long before I was born amen he actually heard the message in 1964 and he was a Ministry student in the Seminary and gave all of that up when he heard the truth and so that part of the testimony just Thrills me I know he's been preaching this message for 60 years and we just respect and honor those who have gone before us and appreciate so much the work that they've done and the constant seeing God's life and his dedication to the word so we're excited to have him come and we want him just to be able to relax brother Jim's been fellowshipping with us now for about a year so it's been a pleasure we've gotten to know him better and better and we really appreciate the character of our brother amen so we want him to come at this time and just uh relax and share what's on his heart amen amen God bless you brother Ben oh Wonder ful savior is Jesus my Lord a wonderful savior to [Music] me he hideth my soul in the glare of The Rock where rivers of pleasure I see oh he hideth my soul in the C of the rock that Shadows of dry [Music] thirsty oh he is my life in the depth of his love with his oh his good evening friends good to be in the house of the Lord tonight isn't it amen amen well I want to just say at the outset outset that I deem it a a wonderful great privilege to be standing here with the man that I have put such confidence and Trust in that he would open the pulpit for an old old Warrior and sometimes I think you know I guess I'm really young when you consider that Moses was 80 and Caleb and all of so I'm not too too old but I guess character is built on Victory not a gift anyway way and so that means I've been through some battles and uh I have to say this because the Lord has delivered me but yesterday I couldn't raise both of my arms like this don't know what it was pinched nerves or whatever I couldn't sleep I was like this all day this morning I got up and I said it's the day Lord so I'm just telling you tonight God's fixing to do something and that brother that's saying the Haven of Rest my message tonight is dealing with the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus through one thing and you know what that is the Clift of the rocken prise Lord God bless you as you take your Bibles tonight and this is a lead to the day what we call Thanksgiving am and I did some research before I came here tonight and brother Brandon preached in streetport Louisiana 1965 11:25 on the invisible Union and my friend's father Lyall Palmer was the song leader there at had passed just passed away when brother Brandon was there and I I think I put in a prayer request for his son which is brother Neil's wife had passed away sister kenlan so I have a real connection with him he happens to be a very very close friend of mine and uh brother Bram talked about brother Lyle his dad and so this is a special time for me and I'm thinking about Thanksgiving the word is give in the in that phrase Thanksgiving and it's really our duty and privilege to give thanks to the Lord for not just saving us and healing us but he's our sooncoming King and we are not we're not in a position probably naturally to understand everything but spiritually we know that we're the children and the invisible bride of Jesus Christ and we are expecting something miraculous to happen in our lives how many expect something we don't come to church for just an exercise and futility we come for one reason that's to hear from the Lord and if he can use me and use you together we're going to accomplish something for the kingdom wonderful wonderful so if you'll take your Bibles and turn to Hebrews Hebrews the first chapter and I have to say this to brother Chad that Sunday he took all my scriptures and I thought no he's not yep no he's not going to read yeah he did that one too four of them and it's not a humorous thing it's a very deep serious thing to me the reason I say deeply serious is God obviously wanted something to set us and and establish Us in the word so that we can receive a thought that he has wanted to give to us and then we'll have our seats Hebrews 1 God who at Sury times and in diverse manners spake in the time time pass under the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds amen who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and uphold All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high amen let's pray Lord when we think this evening of the sacrifice you made sending your representative the very Son of God in the likeness of sinful flesh for brother Swanson tonight for everyone that's here we can claim that you died and you suffered for ourselves each one of us we thank you for that but Lord we want to go into your word and see the beautiful things that you have done in the prophet's lives and the Believers lives and how the Apostle Paul has in his writings has spoke so deeply to my heart because I know Lord It's Your word that is going forth help us tonight Lord to receive the revelation of what he is saying and may we understand by your grace and mercy that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word Grant it Lord we pray in jesus' name amen God bless you you may take your seats it's a wonderful thing to be able to preach the gospel the gospel is the good news so there's nothing sad or depressing about the gospel and I remember years ago and dad would wait my stepfather would wait at the door for the morning paper that was back then probably better good news than it is today and he'd look at the things that had been going on in the world and he would take his cup of coffee and and read the the events and by doing that he kind of got a hand on the pulse of what was going on in the world but today is totally different very very few people get a newspaper very few people even understand what is actually happening in the world if you don't keep up with it you don't know really what's going on and because it's the good news and because God through his word has declared the news of the Gospel it's our privilege and Duty as Believers to declare the truth of the Gospel now I I'm going to go into something a little bit deep and I hope you're awake remember no work tomorrow it's Thanksgiving can I just say this when brother Chad would come back from overseas he he made the statement and I never forgot it he really went there for Fellowship you remember him saying that that's what we go when we my wife and I have gone overseas or the brothers have gone overseas it's it's not just to preach the gospel it's to Fellowship you want to know what the other believer is thinking and how they are responding and how they're living well I was thinking about that while I was still in sier Vista and uh the Electrical Company sent a little brochure out about what was happening in the in the area we're living in and you know that the elevation determines what kind of grapes should be grown whether it's in certain area of California or Idaho or Arizona or whatever and that elevation whatever it is 3,000 ft 4,000 whatever it is they plant a particular grape and when Those Grapes mature remember every single grape has a seed in it and the seed is producing the very nature of what that grape is supposed to be and the vine is not getting much credit other than producing the grape they don't eat or drink the vine it is the grape that's produced well when I began to read that article I got pretty excited because the grapes when they are plucked off the vine years and years and years ago they were put in a vat and in the vat they would lay there until several men would come in and start stepping on them what was the purpose to get the flavor of the wine grape juice out of those grapes and so the article stated if you want to know what the the aroma the texture and the uh type of wine they have to go in with the skins on and rub shoulders in fellowship with one another and lose their identity so they can become the stimulated wine of Revelation so that's why we come together and we share one another's gospel together because we want to rub shoulders with it you see god with skin on it just like a grape it's got to have skin but that affects the flavor and the value and the aroma of that particular style of wine and that's true Fellowship so when we hear the word we're not josling with one another we're actually fellowshipping together and so we're thankful that there is a time of refreshing in the presence of the Lord aren't we I want to go into this just a little thought here that the Lord I'd like to entitle this message the Clift of The Rock and the subject the bride's place of safety I want you to turn if you would with me to the Song of Solomon Song of Solomon and uh see if we can get our basis here for what the lord has laid on my heart and you know you've got the bridegroom and the bride speaking but we're going to go in the first chapter verse 8 Song of Solomon chapter 2: 8 the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a row or a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall he lookth forth at the windows showing himself through the lattice my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one come away for Lo the winter is pass the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle dove that's what turtle is there turtle dove is heard in our land the Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with a tender grape give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away and here's our scripture oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs of the rock why is a scripture talking about the Cliffs of the rock it's because when there's any large cataclysmic event the earthquakes or whatever and the Rocks split or get divided that makes a cliff there and if in the mountainous country that I'm from you can go up into the mountains where brother brandham talked and you can see the cleavage there at all the times something happened either an earthquake or a movement of the mountains and it opened up a cliff and that can be a a a result of a terrible blow or it can just be relaxing the Earth or it can be an earthquake and they'll split like that and that's what the scripture is talking about a Clift in the Rock I want you to notice something here in Hebrews the first chapter when I read Express image of his person now the exact meaning of that expressed image of his person it means exact expression of his substance so if there's a substance that God says faith faith is the substance there's something in that word substance that's connected to Faith and faith is is not something you can explain or Define faith is a revelation and so when faith in the scripture is being used it is being used for a reason to declare something that's in the Unseen World and because we believe that God comes by faith to the believer and you're saved by faith it says in the scripture for by grace are you saved through something through faith you can't go through those doors unless you to pass through them to get to the foyer you have to go through something in order to get saved you got to go through faith it's a real simple thing but it's a it's a part of of life it's part of the scriptures that's why the door is so in important in in in the scripture where Jesus said I am the door and so the door then becomes a passageway and because there is a through faith that not of yourself is a gift of God so faith is the gift of God not of works if it was works all the people in the denominations would be would be just full of faith and could believe or anything but it's not by works it's only by the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally that's how you're saved and it's the gift of faith and it's operating in this building right tonight if we can just latch on to it and with all of our hearts believe that what God has said will come to pass God is not willing that any should perish but it takes the faith of Jehovah to come on the scene through the preaching of the word to save them that believe and to heal those that have a need I want you to go with me if you would to Mark the 11th chapter we won't keep you long tonight as and I don't ever say that I I was telling I think brother Chad one time I was asked to give a testimony when I got got back from Africa and this brother in the church there out west said uh brother Jim you you I'll give you 10 minutes and I thought what's 10 minutes what can you do in 10 minutes when you when youve traveled Halfway Around the World long ways around the world and so I got up and I honored it and I got down at 10 minutes and he come he said that's the first preacher that's ever kept his word I'm not going to do 10 minutes tonight but I might add a few tens on one 10 minute or whatever and not trying to be humorous I'm just saying when God has got something to deliver to the people you just might as well relax and say it's just old brother Jim but I've got a heart that's bursting inside I'm trying to hold down just a little bit here all right Mark 11th chapter we know the story and I want you to notice something that I never knew before and maybe maybe you have so just bear with me in Mark the 11th chapter after Jesus had cursed the fig tree verse 19 when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curs is withered away you think the Lord already knew that of course he did because he believed his own word amen and Jesus answering saith unto them now the King James version says have faith in God but the original Greek says have the faith which God gives it's a big difference the denominations can say we have faith in God but what about the faith that God gives there's your gift that's the gift of God it's not just a common state have faith in God have faith there's even songs wrote like that but if you have the faith that God gives it's Revelation now watch what our precious savior said for right after this statement have the faith that God gives for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall be believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatever he saith the word say is several times there brother Brandon you said you wanted three squirrels and you had to you said it I like what brother Ben said because God put it back on the man that said it if you want three squirrels it expect Three Squirrels if you want Divine Healing expect divine healing God's going to hold you to the word if you say you believe the word that's the cliff in the Rock folks that's your safety the word is your safety it doesn't matter what people say you know that you know that you know when God says something and you latch on to it and say by faith I believe what he said in his word doesn't have anything to do with somebody else believing or whatever it's you the Revelation has to come to you the prophet had it I don't care if the prophet had it the prophet can't save you or heal you God is the only one that could do it through the preaching of the Gospel the word of faith which we preach Paul said right isn't that a beautiful thing Paul actually called The Word of Faith which we preach did you know what the word of faith is it's Jesus Christ you can't be saved or healed by any other brother Brown said I didn't touch that sister she was in the in the congregation I never touched her Jesus touched her and she was healed and did you know there's also a power in the name amen and we'll read this in just a little bit if you have to go through the doors to get to another room that through is a passageway of Faith we'll read it in in in Acts the second and third chapter but here we've got something that Jesus is saying and brother Bram and I've got the quotes brother brandham said I puzzled about that for a long time I couldn't pre yet because the atonement hadn't been the calvary hadn't come yet and it's Jesus saying if which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith in other words here is a little indication that the third poll is going to come in our day what is the third pole it's saying what you believe in your heart it's not something great that's only going to apply to the prophet it's every believer has got that ability when God reveals it to him you can say what you will you can believe what you must because God has ordained a Believer to receive the word and speak the word and it will come to pass why the word says it will the word says it will now verse 25 and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any and that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses and brother Bram said in the message perfect faith faith is based on forgiveness you cannot receive revelation of Faith until you have experienced forgiveness sometimes it's experience that you have to forgive yourself amen yeah we we have a hard time sometime forgiving ourselves we kick ourselves all around the block but we have to forgive you can't receive anything if there isn't forgiveness there you've got to forgive in order for God to come on the scene and Grant you perfect Faith Hallelujah now here we've got a word called image we read it in Hebrews exact image that word image is actually a Greek word that means character you look it up image one of the definitions for image is character but the character is speaking of there isn't the character that brother BR said is a victory this character the scripture is talking about is a tool of Engraving and it takes this is the definition of of image it takes this tool in the hands of an artisan to carve an image whether it's on a signate ring of a king so that he can plunge that into a wax seal there and they know there's only one Signet that has that image of the king and once it's sealed there they recognize that's Authority but this little tool called character is used to do an image so he is the expressed image of his person why did this scripture call Jesus the expressed image of his person because the image and the receiver the one that made the image and the one that received it are the same one when God stamps his faith in your soul you are God's you are God speaking it's not just a a figment of your imagination or maybe may maybe this maybe that it's actually life of Jesus Christ himself because God stamped his identity ification on your life and that image is called a character so I began to think about this character Hebrews 11:1 says faith is a substance so substance is something so real and it's actually another word for substance is confidence faith is the confidence do you think how God has faith in his word does God have faith in his own word to bring it to pass of course he does because he wrote the word he knows what it is he knows how to perform whatever is behind it if he says I am he that heals you then you can go to the bank on that he is the one to do it because he has faith in his own word he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast he wasn't like a lot of so-called Believers wishy-washy and well I don't know today if I'm going to be the one to heal anybody it's God himself is you can you can absolutely without a Shadow of Doubt believe what his word said because God said it and God is the author and finisher of our faith now if we're if we're expecting to have faith in Hebrews it says and and and I really appreciated what brother Chad had brought up and I'm going to make mention of this before but in the 11th chapter let me turn real quickly to that to Hebrews 11 again so here is here is the essence of the message I say that because in denomination we we did the best we could and I I brother Chad had mentioned that I was in the University there and studied and believed that I was going to be ministering in that denomination and it never worked out although I did for several years it never panned out because the message of this hour came my way now I'm going to get excited because what he said Sunday I Heard a Voice the voice was a tape now how in the world can a voice change a destiny of a of a brother that I was already in in the faith in denominational faith I never knew of a prophet all I knew was God was in his word and right now I want to give credit to my father-in-law which which uh I I've never done this publicly he uh he had some issues but I want to tell you one thing he was a Bible scholar and a Bible teacher in the denomination traveled all over the nation teaching the word the word of faith and it was my wife's father and and I in denomination i' never heard this before and so when when we'd have Bible studies in the basement of a little church there he kept teaching it and I I said my wife I said honey there's there's something about the word of faith what is that and being raised like she was and believing in what faith was she kept and we'd sit out now I got to confess something I had to sit out with her in front of the double doors of the university all night long talking the word and they take the flashlight and flash out there to see there they are sitting from each other in the front seat of this old 59 Chevy hard toop and all we could do is converse and I was getting so excited about what she was saying God Was preparing us no profit yet didn't know anything about William brandham and I was in my last year in ' 64 last year to graduate and when the voice came it completely changed my life and I got a new understanding and a love for this right here that never had before brother Chad when you said you you have to smell I I go further than that I kiss my Bible all the time please don't misunderstand that but it's my life I can't even put anything on top of the Bible when it sits on the nightst or in my office it's real to me folks the word is real Hallelujah so if you thought that was that's a lot for a minister to say he has to smell but you know what that's really what a Believer does he gets so taken away with the beauty of the scriptures that he doesn't even hardly want to lay it down Hallelujah so I want you to go with me to the scriptures in the book of Acts after I'll come back to Hebrews here I want to try to hurry here and get some thoughts out good thing there's no clock I can't see it's in the dark here acts the second chapter first verse now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain I love the when the scripture says a certain man a specific individual didn't even have to give him his name but he was a certain brother Brian preached M he be certain of God if you're certain you're special be certain of God and here a certain man laying from his mother's womb 40 years was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered the temp temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple of course did what he did every day he asked for all s and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us and now ask I'm going to ask you something how did this happen how did Peter and John just came from the day of Pentecost in the upper room and he they come down and they they had to be charged with something is that right they were charged with something they they didn't go preach a long sermon they did I would they as far as We Know we don't even know if he said anything other than what's written right here what about the woman with the issue of blood she said in her heart if I can but touch the how did that come Faith came to her to do that might as well just say this faith is a revelation and the Centurion Jesus said I've not found so great a faith in all Israel when the son of man cometh will he find faith on the earth he found it right there is he finding it tonight in your soul in your heart do you know what real faith is to where you can lay everything aside and say I believe your word Lord Jesus reveal it more and more every day until there's nothing that'll stand in the way your your whole life will be cleansed you'll be a different person once you operate in the realm of Faith so here's Peter and John here they come and he said look on us then Peter said silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto thee here's the key in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk 40 years this man had never had enough energy and strength in his legs or he wouldn't have been laying at the gate for 40 years now think of this now so just the words in the name of Jesus rise up and walk now there's a change coming amen there is a procedure that God uses through the mouth of a of a minister Little John and Peter the one that had failed Jesus so many times and the one that couldn't do this and couldn't do that now he's got the power to speak the word and a man he never even knew before who did he didn't have to preach a sermon to he takes him by the hand and lifts him up that is revelation from God alone man couldn't do that brother brah said I can't heal you Peter couldn't heal that man but he could believe the the the inward working of the Holy Ghost in his life had such power that whatever he touched in the name of Jesus motive and objective there you are whatever it is it would come to pass okay now let's look at this a minute and he leaping and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength now where did that come from God himself Peter didn't give him strength in his ankle bones Peter didn't have the power to do that but he had the power to believe that Jesus could do that so what he did is he he introduced the king of kings and Lord of lords the only one that could heal he introduced him and saying I in the name of Jesus rise up and walk and because there was so much Faith there he just left the day of Pentecost he he actually could take the man by the right hand and lift him up and what happens God honors the Act of Faith something happened to that man now I'm going to ask you if you were that man at the gate Callis and unable to move and atrophied muscles and couldn't even move your joints or whatever and somebody comes along a stranger and says I don't have any money to give you I guess maybe if you wait a little bit longer you'll get some more money but I don't even have any money I don't plan on getting any money but I do have something and you won't need any money you don't need any money because what I got will Ser Eed anything you could ever plan on well I need money for my bills what why don't you trust Jesus well I got I got to get another car trust the Lord I'm just thought now brother Franco his daddy was baptized by a friend of mine in Italy brother Franco's father was baptized by Brother Mariano how many know or heard ever heard of brother Mariano where's Sister Amy she's probably up there I don't know where she is yep she's all right I was in his home God don't tell me that God can't come on the scene for you especially in in a realm of Faith like we have tonight so I was talking to brother Mariano oh I said brother Jim with my children my family it's so hard to make against me and he said I just went before the Lord remember now when you pray in faith God hears any prayer you pray you don't have to keep going back to him and saying I'm going to come over again in front and have them pray for me you've done it once and you believe you don't keep coming brother BR said don't do that the only thing that brings you up the second or third time is unbelief God can't honor unbelief he can only honor faith and so brother Mario say I just bariano said I just prayed it wasn't very long he knew exactly what he needed there was a knock at the door and this this knock turned into to be a priest now he had left the Catholic church so now he opened the door to this priest I don't know how I could tell you this sir but he said I was in prayer and the Lord told me to come here and give you $1,200 that's from his lips to my ear $1,200 now what would you do if somebody walked up and said I'm going to give you 1,200 well think of this man at the gate beautiful somebody said I've got something for you you weren't even expecting especially from a Catholic priest how in the world could he be letter of the Lord let me tell you folks you got I ever out guess God you're going to try to say it's all impossible it's never impossible and that's why we have to be it's impossible to please him if we're not walking by faith there's a impossibility and so it was just a few months later he said brother Jim there we were the church is real small we couldn't make it and I got on my knees again I said Lord you know our need you know what's going to happen there was a knock at the door again and a little sister Catholic from the church said I don't even understand it or explain it but he needed $1,800 she said the Lord told me to come and give you this thank you Lord you better hold on cuz I'm fixing to tell you something better than that even it's about me I don't this is not a joking time this is reality folks amen I had a little I'm I'm looking at Brother David down there the diesel mechanic and so he he can smile if he wants but he knows what what Chevrolet Diesel with a Allison Transmission is you you know all that so and it had not a whole lot of miles on it and I was meetings up in Flagstaff and so to save a little money I had a little camp trailer and I hooked on and I'd go up the mountain it's about 6 hours from where we lived and I couldn't get up the mountain they just pull off P kept pulling off and you know whizzing all the traffic going there and finally a highway patrolman bless his heart he come by he saids sir can I help you and I said not really I said unless there's a tow truck somewhere he said oh you're way up in no man's land there's no truck here you take him an hour and a half or two hours to get here can I help you and I said well I just don't want to be hit by the traffic he said well I'll watch well watching can't provide any security or safety he all he could do is just see so he went way up I never did see him again but I thanked him and I limped along and i' sit at the side and i' limp and go another few miles some sometimes it only 200 ft and I thought oh my I finally got up there and I said the first thing I'm going to do is make sure that I have this checked out cuz it happened before so I found a General Motors diesel mechanic that knew those Motors inside out and so I took it in to him and he went through the whole thing he said I've never been stumped but he said I'm stumped I don't know what's wrong and of course I paid handsomely to get it to get that answer can't do anything and he lived about maybe a block from the highway so I said well Dave I said um I've got to get back to see our Vista so uh thank you he said I'm sorry I he had it for days and days he tried everything I was in the shop with him and because I did some mechanicing I was helping and we were trying to figure out now I'm laying a groundwork for something here how many remember what brother Chris Steak said is there anybody that disbelieves what he said it actually happened folks so I'm getting ready hope I don't cry but I'm getting ready to go home and being alone and not having my precious wife with me it gets kind of lonely you know when you're traveling yourself and I I get Melancholy it's all right that's the way we're we're made and so uh that's why I want to thank you all for being so lovely to my family and embracing us and we're here I can't I thought Thanksgiving I got to tell everybody I love him and I can't I've never been treated like this in my life never ever ever and Fa and deric will agree with that also back to the story so I leave his shop and I don't even get to the road a walk away and she dies it dies so I said well I called him on the phone he said how far did you get I said look out your window there I'm sitting on the side of the road again without the trailer hooked up just the pickup and I said I said Dave I I don't really know what to do I don't think I can get 6 hours through mountains and that getting home and he said I'm sorry there's not a thing I can do you could take it to a dealer and he he'll find the same thing because I was a a mechanic for the dealership so I limp back to the RV place where I had the trailer parked and I hooked on Services were over it was time to go home and you know sometimes you quiet yourself and you say Lord why do these things happen what what's the purpose of this I mean I I took care of everything it wasn't like I it was rough or anything and uh while I'm sitting there in the truck hooked up ready to go I said well if I fail to do it I'll probably just have to park it on the side and get some kind of a tow truck to pull all these miles up the mountain so I sat in the truck and I looked out the windshield I said you know every component that's in this truck every component that's in this tree this evergreen tree I see out here everything that's in this shed that's with wood it all came from the Creator there isn't one thing that man has created he might have brought the elements together but he didn't create it and I laid my hands on that steering wheel and I said Lord Jesus give me the faith cuz it's a gift to believe all things are possible to him that believeth and folks I'm going to tell you I laid my hands on it it started I never had a bobble all the way home and I pulled it in there and that was to me an answer to prayer but Faith does that to a Believer if you really want to know what faith does just ask somebody that's had it happened to them they know beyond shadow of a doubt that Faith answers questions that the devil throws at you all the time why why faith is a substance of things H for it's not that we hope hope is excitement that we're going to come into something that's what substance is things hope for we want we expect something now brother BR said hope can be the worst what enemy that face God but when it says faith is a substance of things hoped for that means the substance is putting you in a position to expect expect something that kind of Hope brother Chad is expectation and the word is expecting you to expect something in your life oh help us Lord see this to the Centurion I have not found so great a faith in all Israel what did he have that nobody else had he had the revealed word that he could say Lord just speak the word that's right just speak the word Amen Let me just try to I haven't even got in my message yet but I Lord impressed me to say this and I want to just finish this so you know what happened with all then he walked around praising the Lord and felt so wonderful getting his new legs you know the time the policeman saw this man running out and he chasing him and chasing him and chasing him and the man was just out running and finally he caught him he says sir what's the matter oh not a thing I'm just trying out my new legs because God had just healed him he didn't have to check with a with a constable and say is it all right if I run let me tell you when that woman brought her shoes up she knew that she was going to put those new shoes on because Jesus Christ made her well and how about the woman that had the bad knees Hallelujah brother B can I bow down and on my knees certainly sister you can she believed what the word said and she was healed right there am now it goes on just a little bit verse 16 and his name this is Peter first he said Peter saw it he answer the people why you Israel Marvel at this verse 12 why you look so earnestly on us is it through our own prayer or Holiness we made this man walk it wasn't us and yet it was them they didn't have the power to do it without God giving them the power and but they recognize it wasn't them doing it because they didn't have any power to do it but God did it to of vessel when brother Chad preaches a word there ought to be something happened inside of every believer he said that ain't nothing but the truth and it'll change lives absolutely change lives and verse 16 and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know yay the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all perfect soundness he didn't have anything as far as a sound body at all so what happened creative Power by the very word of God changed that to a man had perfect soundness he didn't have to worry about going to the gate and asking for alms anymore he didn't have to worry what people said or looked at him he had something more real than any OLS could ever buy but we're not not done yet now we go over to chapter 4 verse 10 verse 8 I'm sorry then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by and that also word means in by the name of Jesus of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by or in him does make this man stand here before you oh he was whole so there had to be something that happens oh help me Lord help me Hallelujah now there's a song I asked brother Ben to to sing before I came out and that was written by Fanny Crosby many many years ago a wonderful savior is Jesus my Lord he hideth my soul in the Clift of the rock now if you go with me we're going to see speaking the word does Peter did it now we're going to see it happen and and and fenny Crosby is doing it through her music and we're going to see that in Exodus the 30 so if you'll if you'll go to Exodus the 33rd chapter and also numbers 20 let's let's get onto my message this evening numbers 20 and yes let's do numbers 21 please verse one then came the children of Israel even the whole congregation into the desert of Zen in the first month and the people Abode in Kadesh and Miriam died there who was buried there and there was no water verse Two for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and the people chowed with Moses and spake saying would God that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord and why have you brought us up the congregation of the Lord into this Wilderness that we and our cattle should die here murmurers unbelievers all right and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place it is no place of seed or figs of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly onto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod now remember the rod was a rod rod of judgment and the Bible says spare the rod and spoil the child that means the Judgment must start in the home and God is going to hold the parents responsible if they don't do judgment in a right kind loving way but it still has to be done because brother brandom said that's the Judgment Rod of God all right I'm we finish and Moses went in and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses and said take the rod gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron th brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink and mo Moses took the rod from before the Lord and Moses gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels rebellious ones must we fetch you water out of this rock you notice he took it on himself God never said you're going to do it he said you just take the rod and speak to the Rock but he interpreted you see how influences affect a person he called him Reb re because they were Rebels rebellious but they actually affected his Revelation it they affected his faith because he was in a no way shape or form able to do that but look watch now what happened and the Lord and Moses lifted up his hand verse 11 and with his Rod he smokee The Rock twice brother Bram said he did it once and nothing happened so he did it again he should have realized when they did it the first time that nothing happened he was wrong and the water and he lifted up with his Rod smoked the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because ye believed me not look at this this unbelief what have caused Moses because thou believe me not to sanctify me not in your eyes but in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them in other words he died before he went to the land just because he listened and was influenced by doubt he didn't obey the Lord he didn't speak to him he struck the rock what does it mean it means that he was crucifying the Lord again even though God had never even put Christ on the cross it was a type that the second time he did it he was crucifying the Lord of glory amen I want to show you something here it's very very beautiful now let's go to to Exodus 33 and verse 20 and he said thou cast not see my face for there shall no man see me and live but Moses wanted to see him all right and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt shall stand upon upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen and brother Bram said he took on an image of Flesh just like MDC and that is what Moses saw because no man has seen God at any time the only begotten has declared him so I have to add that real quick because that's what what Thomas said I won't believe unless I put my hands in he said blessed are th but it's better to believe without seeing than seeing so if you see the word and nobody agrees with you that's better you see it anyway because that's what God is wanting you believe without seeing think of this now just for a moment you can believe the word by the Revelation that Jesus Christ is real just like Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said upon the rock Revelation I'm going to build my church so this rock is important All Through the Bible and there's a Clift in the Rock there I just read it here the Clift in the Rock so now I want to read what the prophet said and we're going to try to get into a few thoughts here but before I do I want to say this remember in Book of Genesis it said God said let there be light how many know that let there be light in other words allow it to happen whatever it takes whatever is going on in that other realm of faith and God believing his own word and he said let there be allow it to happen take any restrictions away or whatever let there be light amen do you believe there was light yes sir watch what the prophet said God said they know okay they read it they can see the glory of God and things like that it's just a word to them but to us let there be light is a manifestation that's right see it is no more a word it's a reality oh get this tonight when he said let there be life it didn't matter if there's no way anybody could prove it but the manifestation was light and once he said let there be light there was light here's what he said this is the veiling of God he said God said let there be light that was the word but now there is light it ain't the word anymore it's light yes oh I got to say that again once he establish the fact that there's going to be light he doesn't have to keep saying saying it once he says you're healed in Jesus name he doesn't have to keep saying it you're going to accept the light or you're not going to accept it it doesn't matter if you accept it it's still true and he doesn't have to keep saying let there be let let there be let there be healing let there he already did it it's up to you to receive it if you can receive the word like you can the sunlight and the and the stars and whatever you can surely believe that when God said you are healed in Jesus name you are going to be healed Hallelujah I had to say that I was just waiting for that now he said but what if I would say it just in myself nothing will happen let there be this let be that he said if I was doing it myself nothing would happen but he said I would but what if I would say it like that but they say it's a you're a hypocrite but if I ever tell you to get up out of that wheelchair for you're going to get up there's one thing sure if you don't you wouldn't mind me you might never leave the spot where you're at but you can only do what God shows you to do but I can declare get up out of that wheelchair you know the you know the testimony of my wife when she's just a young girl and she worked in the fields with the Mexicans and picking potatoes and whatever and she got got real sick and she was a straight A student in school and she couldn't she had no strength to go to school and her dad my father-in-law an Assembly of God teacher believed the word and he said Jean I'm going to pray for you amen and I'm going to ask the Lord to heal you cuz he's already done it 2,000 years ago but I want you to receive it by faith sure Dad sure you know she's miserable sick so he went in and prayed for her left the room come back 5 minutes he says what are you doing and she said all snuggle up in her her Afghan or whatever it is she says I prayed for you what are you doing in bed and this this is way the way my wife was raised lying vanities can take away all the faith that God might have shown you because you're going to believe you're still sick but if you follow the word and act on the word faith is an action it's an active verb so she said well well I I I said you believe when Dad prayed for you you were going to be healed well yes but Dad I don't I don't care how you feel you're either going to stand in the word or stay sick that's my wife don't you see why we I was thinking about elaser he didn't know I know when I looked at my little Rebeca she wasn't Rebecca it was Jean but when I looked at her I had such love for her I said when you are ready I'm going to take you home elaser said the same thing to Rebecca and he took her home to Isaac that was my love for that little girl I had that love why because it was the word that was manifest in her I saw that and together we enjoyed the blessing of the Prophet hearing that little tape in our apartment in Minneapolis I said no I didn't know anything about William brandom I didn't know all the tapes but we got a hold of 1 7in re to reel and I just said there's nothing I've ever heard like the voice of that man and bald and sat there and cried you've heard it I know and cried and cried and cried and said Lord Jesus so this is what I've been asking for so this is the truth that's why denominations are wrong whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and it shall be given you is that right verily verily I say unto you if you say now that's here's the spoken word now if you say to this mountain in your heart be cast plucked up and Cast Away and don't doubt it but believing that those things will come to pass you'll have whatsoever brother Braham said whatever I say oh it must be wrong it must be what Jesus said no Jesus said whatever you say amen God so brother Brandon you said you wanted Three Squirrels isn't God precious and and just so willing to to do whatever we want not to people that don't like squirrel meat or don't like shooting animals that's one thing but the prophet said i' let there be one over there and live and the farmers over there and then and we be there and then then he got two and that was good enough and he went how many appreciate what brother Bren said about that you know what it comes down to thus sayith the Lord he actually spoke those squirrels in existence because God gave him that ability to he didn't create the squirrels brother brand didn't create them God did but he used a human vessel called a voice it spoke the word and squirrels came into existence don't you think he can heal my body or your body if he could do that for a prophet he's one wanting to see there's the third pole speaking the word back you have to prove his word in your life oh help us Lord here a little story brother Bram talks about Smith Wigglesworth and I I love some of the things that he said but one thing there's a little story he read he had a little granddaughter named April and little April helped her Grandpa brother Wigglesworth in meetings and getting things ready and everything and he thought a lot about her and he thought well I've saved enough money now I want to give her a gift how many heard this story maybe maybe you have give her a little gift so he took her to a beautiful jewelry store and he he didn't want to choose it for her but he noticed that she didn't have a watch and she looked at these watches these gorgeous beautiful diamond encrusted watches and she he could he was standing at his side and he could just see that oh little girls like shiny things they like little things like that and here she's looking at that and then just kind of sagged a little bit and kept going down the line until she got to the cheapest ugliest little watch there in the jewelry store and brother Smith was looking at her and he thought oh and so she went up there and he paid for it and he said honey you really sadden me why Grandpa it's just like when God gives you a gift he gives you the best he's got amen and you took you thought well grandpa I thought because I said he said that's the problem God will bankrupt heaven for you so when you ask of God ask believing and he's going to give you the best that you've ever had before I was telling a brother the other day I said if you are invited to a house and you know behind that door is a million dollars in gold bullion sitting there and all you have to do is open the door I said the exite the excitement starts before you ever enter that room but you got to go through something to reach that gift and the gift of faith is like that it isn't up to you whether you're good bad or indiffer it's whether the preaching of the word of faith which we preached Paul said enables you to believe God and then God grants that gift and whatever you have I don't care if it's heart trouble or whatever God is able to deliver you even as you're sitting and brother Bosworth Would S just start preaching or just teaching the word sitting in a stool and the people were healed right there he said I never touched them but he built the word of faith in their hearts to where they could receive what they had need of Hallelujah now let me go into something that that I hope helps you should I look at the clock oh my I might have to just wait on the rest of it brother Chad it's getting late and I I've got something on my heart I want to say so I want to get in the the Clift of the rock so bad but you know the reason there was a cliff brother Bram said is because when Moses struck the rock it took a divot or a piece of that rock out and that is why there was a cliff of The Rock and the Cliff of the rock Fanny Crosby wrote this song There was Honey in the Rock that's where the bees would make their honey was in that cliff and that Cliff of the rock became more than just an impression or a depression in the rock it actually it actually occurred because of unbelief and when Jesus bore your sins and your sorrows and your wounds you were in him when he did that amen and the only way that you can get revelation of that listen to me tonight is that you are actually part of the wound that he suffered for your sake and and then I read out of this this uh song of salmon you actually have to crawl back up into that womb for for safety don't look at me like this now I want you to listen to what I'm saying the wound was your fault you caused the wound in the savior he didn't do it it was your sin that did it and you've got to crawl back up in there and that is your only place of safety is the wor of the word praise God and when the brother BR said when they forced that spear in his side the bride was released but she was already in him she was in him already when he was crucified on the cross you crucified him yes you made him go through the pain and so now the Cliff of the rock is your only safe place it's the only place you could be safe because you caused the pain I caused the pain we caused the pain he was he was wounded for our transgressions the chastisement of our pieces upon him and by his stripes we were healed so we were there weren't we amen no let me let me just I'm going to stop at 9:00 but I have to read something that the Lord showed me forgive me for not getting into my whole message but I this is the end of the message and I hope you could understand I've been devouring the book The Masterpiece and in the Masterpiece brother Brenham said it was not only Christ that was crucified and clefted but it was also the bride or the church the bride was also and so let me start this by saying in the message the Masterpiece brother Branham said something that really triggered a thought so I did some research and I began to see some things i' never seen when he brought that up you see I've been to Italy several times I've been to the Peter's Church of the chains and that's that's chains that are on display that they believe were on Peter when he was in prison and they made a big deal over and they've got the chains and they said miraculously they came and they joined together up there on this pedestal that's not why I went I wanted to see Michelangelo's Moses I've seen it twice about as close as this is for me brother Bram saw a copy at at Fort or whatever lawn there is in California but I was actually in front of the now they won't let you get close and they won't let you take pictures because they say the flash bulbs affect the marble I don't know if that's true or not but maybe the millions of people that have seen it but I want to just give you some back background Michelangelo means Michael the angel and if you'll notice in the book I believe it's Jude where where the devil was contending with Michael for the body of Moses you remember that okay maybe that is what caused Michelangelo because of that maybe that's what caused him to do what he did let me read some things here Michelangelo was given a damaged piece of marble and I'm going to say another preacher started on it to use it as a as a statue and he broke it wrong and he threw it out and I think of my savior the rock that was rejected and so Michael Angelo found this massive piece of marble that was damaged and he he took it to his shop there let me read they called him a Mystic because when he would look brother R called him the great sculpture he would look at that piece of marble and they called him a Mystic because he could actually in the vision of his mind see the subject that he was fixing to make out of that marble actually reposing sleeping in that marble now you think about the very God that we serve he knew you before you were ever born you were in him and here's a man called Michelangelo that saw this rock and knew exactly what he was going to make out of it so in the back part of his mind this is proven by the way back part of his mind he saw an image and so when he approached that marble he looked at the Fishers that's cracks and veins in it and he looked at it and he knew that that subject that he's fixing to make is is caught in a prison of rock I've got to release him that's the way we were we were in a prison of our own thinking and denomination and he said I have to release you he saw the potential in you right because he's the rock and you're the rock you're part of the rock you know how long it takes for a a three-pointed little chisel and a hammer for Michelangelo takes years years to do it let me read he believed the figures he formed were already in the blocks of stone needing to be released by The sculpt by studying the marble that's us its Fishers in veins he could determine where the subject slept inside that rock then layer by layer test and trial by test and trial Blow by blow he would liberate his is subject from its Rocky prison I just I think that's poetic the art was suffering Michelangelo suffered this whole time because his one of objective was to free the subject from The Rock and make it alive amen now do you see why after he polished and finished it and sat B and looked at it and took turned it around three-dimensional I've looked at it I've seen the the blow on his right knee I know what it looks like I'm not just talking about something I don't know I know cuz I sculpted when I was young I didn't have marble to do like him but I did in wood and different other pottery and that but I know when I had a vision of something I wanted I was never satisfied until it was done and here this man finally produced brother BR said all the years of suffering and in travail he wanted to make that image come to life so bad because he knew it was restricted inside that rock and he he had the authority by his own nature to release that from that rock and God did the same thing to you and me when he reached down with his power and released us from the denominational thinking or men's ideas do you realize you breathe better you got you got happier your whole system was changed because you were birthed by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah no wonder after seeing this imprisoned Moses one that interesting thing about this statue it has two bumps on its head well in case you're wondering it's because a sculpture can't sculpt or fashion Glory and because the glory was on Moses Michelangelo had to make two big it looked like horns of the devil but it wasn't it was actually the glory of God on that vessel it was so real it he it came into such perfect harmony with the vision with the image the character of that image was Michelangelo's Moses that he had to Smite it and say speak because he released it from the other way that the man was that that that U uh Vision was bringing him out of the other life that he had he had no freedom in that life so by doing that he was now released and he had to say speak until we understand what really means speak to that mountain speak to that rock Moses failed the Lord and didn't get to the promised land but we don't need to we've got the Cliff of the rock to hide in we can go in there and it isn't made by our own ideas God himself made that Clift by the crucifixion and that's where we crawl in that's where we're hidden that's where we're safe that's why Fanny Crosby had to write that song prise God Amen God bless you tonight amen and I guess I don't feel so bad but he died when he was 89 years old Michelangelo did but he produced a lot of great great works because he had a desire in his heart but it even goes deeper than that how many know that the main thrust of the news has been through several years what is your DNA what is your DNA that's the real you and they can find it and scrape it and do this or whatever from the saliva whatever and it proves who you were in your background you know that's true but God has his own DNA that's right are you ready yeah DNA deity now abides let's stand you are deity today you are deity you've been cut out of the Rock and you are living breathing absolute product of his resurrection and you aren't you don't have to worry anymore whether it's going to happen or not it already has happened you were already healed before you ever came on this Earth You were healed but you got to accept it you got to accept it by faith and God grant the gift to everyone here tonight may the Lord bless you richly I tried to make it by 9:00 and we're pretty close but someday I'll finish the message I don't know when but I'll finish it but we love you and appreciate and when I say Happy Thanksgiving I don't mean the the world way I just said Thanksgiving it's giving thanks to our Heavenly Father you want to raise your hand and say thank you Lord for saving me thank you Lord for delivering me thank you Lord for healing God bless you brother Chad come musicians I forgot to say you may come amen don't you love to see the Zeal of the word all through life it hasn't Abad over 60 years and this word is more real you can tell more real to him than it's ever been I say oh God let that power Rest in Me amen what a lesson on faith amen from somebody who's lived it had the experience who feels encouraged he wants to go believing for all the promises that we have I love it was so beautiful that he taught us just to receive the promised word don't argue with it don't fuss with just receive it say Lord that's for me you said that for me amen amen before we sing I just wanted to say something that struck me while our brother was talking about the cleft in the Rock and how Jesus was smitten and brother bam said and we came out the ingredients for his bride we came from the word that was the word made flesh we came from the word and what he was teaching was so profound that the only place of safety is back in the Clift back where we came from Back to the word where is the safety back from where we came we came from the word we must come back to the side of Christ back in Union with the word and that's our safety that's where there's Honey in the Rock from a wound that's turned to the sweetness of our Redemption amen
