God bless them today and thank my wife for coming and being aart for helping support me and as brother Chad said we've been a part of the church in Louisville Kentucky there for 35 years helping brother Brad Burgess there and before that we were 17 years at the brandham Tabernacle helping uh we moved there when I was 2 years old so that's kind of my history so I was yesterday I was talking to my wife I said I need to be more like brother Chad he's just so calm and you know just nice and and you know it's this we Billy Graham visited Louisville so Jeffersonville right across the Rivers Louisville Kentucky and we go to church in Louisville but I live in Jeffersonville area all of my life pretty much much and so Billy Graham visited Louisville and he said it was brother Ram quotes him he said it was the most demon powerered place in the whole world so that's just where I live so it's a I mean like I need to be like this brother this brother but you know the battle is intense but God has us all right where he wants us as a little saying you says you got to grow where God's planted you and let's just grow today is that your desire Lord let me grow a little bit amen let's go to the Lord in prayer and as we bow our heads this morning I wonder who would raise their hand and say Lord I have a need this morning I amen I have a need maybe a sickness in my body or something in my family a child or something that's on your heart you just lift your hand to the Lord Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads to you Lord we we need you father Lord as we never want to be self-sufficient but we want to always be mindful of our littleness Lord and how much we need you Lord we raise our hands to you and cry Abba Father Heavenly Father may you help us today and speak to the needs of the people Lord I know I'm not adequate to do that but Lord You're the great physician you're the Mighty God you're the counselor you're the prince of peace and I come to you today and we each one come to your throne and surrender ourselves to you and pray that you would help us Lord as we open the Bible I pray God that you would reveal yourself to us in a special way we pray and ask it in Jesus name amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles go to St John chapter 14 amen it's good to have the freedom to open our Bibles isn't it you know that's a freedom amen and freedom is not free somebody gave their life that we could publicly stand and read our Bibles we should always honor the veterans and those that have gone before us I know we have some of the law enforcement people with us today and God bless our policemen I know they're trying to do away with those things and we have lawlessness that's happened but amen may God Amen help us to remember the freedoms that we have St John chapter 14 I just want to read three verses as we launch we got to launch from somewhere right we get up in orbit we don't know where we're going to land but we're going to be up there amen it was at Revelation chapter 4 come up higher man I want to come up higher I I I don't know about you I didn't come to this place to waste my time I said Lord I want to achieve something I want to draw close to God there's a verse in the Bible says draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you the Bible says res resist the devil and he'll flee from you and so let's draw nigh to God we're going to open his word this is God in letter form St John chapter 14 verse1 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you this is such a powerful promise from Jesus Christ is it in red in your Bible amen Jesus didn't speak in red letter somebody was kind enough to say hey let's make this red so it's when Jesus spoke but this is when the big man spoke okay he said I go to prepare a place for you I mean that's God's word to each one of us as Christians and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know and the way you know Thomas saith un him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen may God add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning for a little portion of time I want to speak on the thought things that are to be things that are to be brother Brandon preached a message um entitled things that are to be and he in 1965 December of 1965 and if if you if you listen to the sermon it was December the the 5th and it was 19 days before the Lord would call him and take him home and if you listen to the sermons it's almost as if he's and he says this he said this was as a funeral text and it's like he's actually preaching his funeral and he knows he's coming to this place brother Charlie Cox is my wife's um uh father's Uncle uh down in Kentucky and so the last time brother random was there he he brother ROM was in the car and brother random brother Charlie was standing there and brother am takes his hat off and hands it to brother Charlie said here brother Charlie I want you to take my hat he said no brother am I don't need your hat he said no brother Charlie he said I won't need it anymore and he handed it to him and gave it to him so he knew he was going to cross over if you listen to that message it's as if he's he's preaching his own F funeral and telling us the hope that is in Jesus Christ and so that sermon kind of goes in that direction but as I was listening to it the other day the Holy Spirit began to lead me and show me that you know there there the word is so power powerful and there's so many facets to the word of God you can never exhaust the inspiration amen it's life as Jesus said there my in another place my words are spirit and they're life so they're inspired the word of God is inspired that's why you should read the Bible every day you should start the day reading the Bible and praying and before you go to bed at night you should read the Bible and pray because it's the inspired word of G God it's life and as I begin to study this thing I begin to study things that are to be that you know as we go through life's Journeys there there's things that are to be there's things that are going to happen to us good to see you brother Jonathan and your family amen there's things that are going to happen to us through life just as if we were going to leave this building you know we're going to go out and we're going to go to the road and it tees and we make a right and those are things that are to be you'll go down a little bit farther I'm going to go down i71 in a few hours and you'll get to the next Road you'll make a right and you go down a little bit and I'll get on I75 south I'll take that road and along that Journey I'll come to the Big Town of Dayton and then Cincinnati and then I'll head towards Louisville and those are things that are to be are you with me that that's just life if I plan to go on that Journey that way it's just a way of life and there's things that are to be in our life as we make this journey there's just things that happen that as we go through it and the Bible says in 1 Corinthians chap 10:1 that the scripture this is our road map it's a it's a map of people who have traveled before you and so when you are going through life things that are to be we look back at the Bible I believe it says there in the scripture all things happened under them for amples they are written for our admonition so people before us that went down this road they wrote down what they saw the same as you go out here and you'll make a right if you're going 65 south and things that are to be you'll get up there and you'll make another right to to go to get on the enters say how many are with me today those are things that are to be so I can tell you that because I've been there and I've done done that already and the people that went through the Bible they wrote it down holy men of God were moved by the Holy Spirit and so we see things and so as we go through life and and when you encounter something you go back to the Bible and say where is that in the Bible that'll really help you as you go through life say I don't know I've never encountered sickness before I wonder if anybody else on the road ever encountered sickness oh praise God Amen Jesus knew 2,000 years ago you were going to SI be sick amen that's why it says in Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities we might as well stop right there he for your transgressions he 2,000 years ago were already bruised for those for your iniquities what is Iniquity knowing to do good and not doing it he already took it 2,000 years ago amen and by the Bible says by his stripes you can be healed so the great almighty God knew you would be coming down that road he went down that road and he bore your sickness he bore your pain can you say Amen you might be sitting here in pain but he bore my pain amen I don't have to bear pain and in another place the Bible says a wounded Spirit the Bible says who can bear it maybe you've got a wounded Spirit and the Bible says who can bear it you can't bear it amen but he said the Bible says he came to bind up the Brokenhearted oh it's wonderful to be a Christian it's wonderful to be in the house of God and come to the great physician and no matter what need you have you can come to the great physician and say Here I Am here's my symptoms but I'm not telling you how to make me better you're the doctor you tell me how to be better A lot of times we come to God and say well I got this problem this problem this problem and this is how you should fix it there's a pastor you have people do like and this is how we're going to fix it like no no no wait let's just stop right let's let God fix it let's let God fix the problem amen sometimes we encounter things in life and we don't know how to to to to get through it we live in a fastpaced society it's become faster and faster with the internet and technology and hey Siri do this and Alexa do this and we're just like and if it doesn't then we're just kind of move it on but God doesn't move like that and sometimes God gives you a little sickness in your knee and you're just like and pretty soon you're like I just want and we want a magic W God that we can just wave a wand over you know wave a wand over the problem and it goes away but God's not like that sometimes sometimes he puts a little Affliction in our life to draw Us close to God David said before I was afflicted I went astray is everybody with me today I'm one of those preachers where if it doesn't work through the week what good is it if we all go to church and it's all good on Sunday and Wednesday but what about when I need God on Tuesday and what about the hour of Temptation amen what about Affliction and it's a real world that we're living in we're not in a I'm getting ahead of myself but we're on this journey you know going through life and you know something that's always stayed with me brother R says in the message power of transformation he had gone through life and it's one of the few times in the world that we have a prophet that we're able to live through through his life as brother Chad and we have 1,200 messages by a prophet telling us his failures his down settings his Uprising the high mountains the low valleys and we actually see the life of Elijah the spirit of Elijah and William Brandon and his life portrayed out and he madees this statement he said your jobs will fail you might be a young young man getting your first job and like this is my forever job Propet says hey your jobs are going to fail he goes on to say your health will fail even your life here on Earth will fail but then that won't fail talking about Christ he is the center of all things then let's keep our minds on the center post I say let's keep our minds on Jesus Christ he's everything as a little song he said he's everything to me he's the counselor to us he's the Prince of Peace he's the Mighty God I love Isaiah there I love to quote the Bible I love to quote the scriptures can you say Amen to that amen it's the word of God and if you have the Holy Spirit something inside of you says say Amen now you might have had a bad day you might have fought on the way to church you might have kids and your you know I had three raised three boys and it was just real life you know we got to the place we just like get in the car get in the car are we going to church Sunday did the sun come up we're going to church I like what my pastor said what do people do when they don't go to church what what do they do you just sleep till 10: and then get up and go watch the G but no this is this is Jesus day this is Sunday this is a day that's dedicated to the Lord that we come together to honor the Lord's Resurrection amen honor as a one man was blind he couldn't see or here and he went to church I said why do you go to church he said I go to church to show God and the devil whose side I'm on Amen I say I want to show God whose side him on today I don't want the devil to know I'm on God's side today can you say Amen to that how many been baptized in jesus' name raise your hand say I've been baptized in Jesus name I took on the name of Jesus Christ can you go back to that place this morning and go back to that old cold grave when you walk down I remember I got baptized at the brandom Tabernacle the Holy Spirit moved in a powerful powerful way and there was many of the people that got baptized that night was but I was like they only had so many robes and so I got the wet cold robe and I remember standing in the back and I I don't like cold and I was shaking like this but I was going the grave because I wanted my sins buried amen down in that watery grave as a symbol I think brother Ram says that in the future home he said you chop off your sins he said repent and be baptized for the remission for the getting rid of your sins aren't you glad you got rid of your sins brother said you chopped them off oh praise be to God I'm so glad amen I went down in that watery grave of water baptism and raised in a newness of life to be a Christian blessed be the name of the Lord I was thinking about that as we as Christians go through this life we encounter many things maybe you think about the first time you maybe encountered Christianity or or Christ because many people like we we get in these when did you come to the message well the message is Christ when did you come to Christ that's the main thing Christ I've been around I'm not a dinosaur but I've been around a long time people encounter what we call the message and then they leave like you never met Christ Jesus Christ he is Christ the word of God remember he asked Peter thou are he said Thou Art the Christ Thou Art the anointed one the son of the Living God he said Flesh and Blood didn't revealed this to but my Father which is in heaven revealed it to you and Jesus said Upon This Rock I'm going to build a church on a church is going to be built on Revelation we need to be built on Revelation of the word of God are you built on Revelation or you just come to this church because the carpet's nice no there was no one baptized in the Bible but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or they had to go back and be re-baptized to receive the holy spirit is that the Bible Acts 19 are you built on Revelation do you know you come to this church because of a revelation of the word of God Amen we as men especially men should know what we believe and know what we believe comes from the Bible you sisters ought to say Amen what my husband you young men that's why you pay attention in church because we want to be built on a rock of Revelation so you ask you know we just got one service this morning so I'm trying to do this a little concentrated brother said you just preach he said we'll do the two in one he said they like a long service all right we'll just let's just stay together amen so you start this journey of your life and many times the first thing you encounter is a Christian you encounter a Christian you meet somebody and something they have that you want and they they and then they begin to point you to the word of God maybe you can point you to the Bible why do you dress like that because the Bible says it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair is that what your Bible says if I die does that change the no no it's the word of God Amen so you encounter the word of God and then maybe you as you begin to read the word of God and and the Bible tells us to be baptized and so maybe you were baptized well first we got to repent we've seen a lot of people go in the water and go down wet centers and come up you know go down dry centers and come up wet centers we don't want to do that we want to repent go down and make a change say God I'm tired of this and repent and be baptized and then receive the holy spirit in our journey of life and then there's healing along the way and there's encouragement and there's deliverance and there's joy and there's shouting and there's Praises of God and it all starts somewhere in our journey and I was thinking of some scriptures as we go through this journey and in Acts the second in the third acts the third chapter I didn't know how you all did he brother said that you all have your Bibles I love the people have their Bibles their sword you know and you should you know Mark these scriptures in your Bibles and Mark your road map up this is the road map when I go through something in life I go back in the Bible and say did somebody else go through this they tell me there's a stoplight up there what do I do when I get the stoplight well you wait till it gets green and then you make a right or you make it and so that we reading the Bible and so the Bible tells us and we're just going to go through Acts 3: 19 so I want to look at a couple times as this journey of life there's going to be times of refreshing in your life Acts 3: 19 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of God the times of refreshing from the presence of God Amen is that what your Bible says now the Bible wouldn't say that there's times of refreshing from the presence of God if there wasn't times that you weren't refreshed so the Bible is telling us there's going to be times of refreshing but that also means there's going to be times where you don't feel fresh where you don't feel like going to church and you feel like God's a million miles away but that's okay Somebody went before us and said that the times of refreshing will come but they come from the presence of God they don't come from just sitting at home and taking oh we need to yeah we need to go to the Bahamas that's all good and I understand that but the times of refreshing come from the presence of God Amen David said I was glad when they said let us go into the house of the Lord amen to go into the house of the Lord he said lift up your hands in the sanctuary oh praise the Lord and this journeys of life I thought about this as he began to study it he said when the times of refreshing shall come I'm thankful for those times of refreshing go back to the Book of Psalms we're going to just look at a couple of things you'll encounter along the way so thankful for David that went before us amen these things are written for our admonition can you say Amen to that as we read the word of God there should be something down inside of you that says amen that's the the holy spirit it's like some my son is a songwriter see he writes songs and then when maybe he's sitting there and somebody else is singing his song and he says that's good because he wrote that amen so you're just we're just man was God took up some dirt he picked up Adam from the dust of the Earth right so we're just a a product of the Earth but inside of us should be a seed of God that the Holy Spirit has quickened and you might have a bad day as the pot and you might have a lot of things with that's holding the seed of God but when the word of God is spoken some down inside of you says I wrote that yes sir amen amen you could sit there and have your bad day but God is an eternal spirit of God that dwells inside of the believer and he says amen my dad says don't try to sing a a great Holy Ghost filled song with your mouth closed because you'll blow the side of your head out that's the way it was on the day of Pentecost brother said they came out of the windows and the doors amen they said these people are drunk stagging around the holy spirit said no they just got that new wine they've been Intoxicated by the holy spirit amen sometimes we just need to let the Holy Spirit go amen and let him be God and let him amen say amen glory to God I wrote that I'm giving you a road mapap that when you get to this place you when you get to that Junction you remember back remember Jesus said this my wife's a Sunday school teacher I'm a Sunday school teacher we're kind of skipping out today you know text my brother my boy William today said hey uh praying for you he's teaching Sunday school somebody else following for her but David said Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against God Jesus said take no thought what you would say for I will bring to your remembrance the things that I have spoken unto you listen to me but he can't bring them to your remembrance until you put them in your heart till you put them in your mind God has nothing to bring to the remembrance remember the Bible says what is Ephesians chapter 6 The Sword of the spirit which is the word of God so the spirit is the great powerful eternal spirit of God but he has nothing to work with but the word of God and as my wife saying the song the word of God will defeat the Devil any place anywhere any time amen so as I tell people in our message don't let go of your Bible whatever you do don't let go of your Bible I fear sometimes we got 12200 messages of the Prophet that reveal the Bible but somewhere we forgotten that all of it came from the Bible and sometimes we try to separate say that's the Bible and this is the message no you they're Inseparable this is a great mystery but every message brother Baron preached he'll say turn in your Bible and out of the Bible came this great revelation of the word of God oh praise be to God I'm going to get us all back to the Bible get us back in the Bible in fact after the seals they came to brother B brother B you could write Revelations 23 you could write brother B said no no no because the Bible says if you add to or take away your part will be taken out of the Book of Life we got to remember what we believe comes from the Bible oh I love my Bible I love my Bible sometimes when people come to dedicate their heart to the Lord I said bring your Bible amen we're not dedicating ourselves to an idea or even to a church or brother Daniel you're dedicating yourself to Jesus Christ and I know Christ by the word of God Amen here's Psalms chapter 34 praise the Lord you are listening so good and so intently amen Psalms chapter 34: 19 these are powerful powerful verses of somebody that went before us and he says many are the afflictions of the righteous is that what your Bible says many it doesn't say one you'll get one Affliction in your life doesn't say occasionally you'll get an Affliction the Bible says many are the afflictions so if you go down the road say Hey you go up here and make it right but there's a bunch of potholes in the road when I get there and I see potholes I don't like a no I was told there's going to be potholes so as I read the Bible Somebody went before me said be careful many are the afflictions of the righteous there's many potholes along the road but that's not the end of the verse Oh praise be to God but the Lord can you say that the Lord will deliver him out of them all amen he'll take you around the potholes and the pitfalls of life amen oh praise God and Jesus said in another place I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you oh we ought to take that verse and just tuck it right close to our heart he said he would never leave me he would never forsake me he would be a guide to me oh praise be to God there's such comfort in the word of God hey this will cure anxiety this will cure depression I'm not against those medicines and God bless those men that they're helping people along the way but I tell you go in the presence of God it'll certainly help too amen it'll the word of God say God the Creator said he would never leave you me he would never forsake me I got a brother they took him we was going to throw him in the Lions then because he was praying and the Bible says when Daniel heard this amen he he opened the windows and he prayed to God and they threw him in but the pillar of fire was there amen he had some brothers Shadrach Meshach and abedo and they said look we're going to play this music again I want you to stay right here me I'm way away from my notes right and he said there is a culture and this culture plays to a certain beat and you will play to this certain beat or you're not a part of us in fact you're going to die you ever have people that you you'll march to this beat or this music or you're going to die you're going to die spiritually like well wait a minute wait a minute I don't know you know it's really amazing they had to bow to that image and the and the young men said look we don't they said we're going to give you another chance they said we don't need another chance isn't that good brother Kyle we don't need another chance why listen to me close why did they why could they say before the king we don't need another chance because they hid the word of God in their heart the Bible says El should not make into the any grave and EV Shall Not Bow before image they didn't need another chance because the word wasn't going to change oh praise God the word of God is forever settled in heaven may it be settled in our heart do you think you'll ever see your pastor allow a woman to come out with the Bible and open it and say now I'm going to take a text that I'm going to preach to you today now you all are laughing as if it's humorous but there's only one listen to me there's only one thing that you have an assurance and you can laugh because you know your pastor is tied to the word of God 2 Timothy 2:12 I suffer not a woman to teach or Ser authority over a man so it's the word of God that is keeping us where we should be the things how's the Bible say by him all things consist our churches held together the the the deacons ships and every positioner is held together by the word of God so you see when they take the word of God out of our culture out of our society it how's it say in the Old Testament it's confusion people become confused and they don't even know which bathroom they should go into and these movements of our culture changing it'll change the whole uh it'll change the whole building industry and you'll have male female and then undecided or un confused I don't know may God help to come to the house of God and know the things of God Amen many are the afflictions we're going to encounter some things but the Lord will deliver us out of them all praise the Lord Psalms chapter 61 praise be to God I like this one Psalms 61 I don't know how to preach we'll just let the Holy Spirit take us where we need to go amen Psalm 61 David said Hear My Cry Oh God and attend to my prayer for from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee this is so powerful when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I is that what your Bible says I want you to notice sometimes we read over this and we say Amen but I want you to really stop here because David said when my heart is overwhelmed he doesn't say if my heart is overwhelmed he says when when I get up here and make that turn in all those potholes when I get to that spot and David is saying when your heart gets overwhelmed because it's going to happen if you stay on the road I can go out here and say I'm going to change my direction and go here and head down that way and many people do that you pull up to a light and you got your window down you got their window line their their GPS says make a left when possible your GPS says make a right when possible sometimes you in Christianity you get around people and like well they're saying make a left I want you to listen to me they might not be going where you're going they might not be going where you're going they may not have heard the voice of God for our generation but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of how to get there amen will be revealed and he puts us on the right Road amen elaser is bringing someone Amen to meet Isaac the bridegroom can you say Amen to that and I want to hear that voice and other people I don't doubt that they you know um I just we went to to I'm trying to slow down here we just came from Utah on a vacation I said I got to go see Joseph Smith's thing the Mormon church and all like he so we went he heard an angel met an angel I went and heard the story I went back and heard brother said he said I I don't dispute that this man met an Angel and the angel spoke to him many things they have a huge M movement I think 13 million members but brother amam said what the angel said to him was contrary to the scripture and there's many people on that road but I heard another voice the voice of the seventh angel and he said it's got to be written in the Bible now they had to go write another Bible to support what that angel said they came to William Braham said you should write another Bible he said no I can't write another Bible it's the revelation of the already written word I say Lord just reveal it to me amen but somewhere you got to stop and slow down and read the word of God and not run past it we got to slow down a little bit and that's why God brings Affliction sometimes sometimes he brings trouble in a family sometimes he brings trouble in a church so we all slow down and we begin to pray we begin to pray prayer amen sometimes we the afflictions is what causes us to pray and draw close to God I have so many things on my heart but when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the Rock can you say that lead me lead me you might be in a place this morning you say brother Daniel you're I know this is for me I'm overwhelmed I'm just completely overwhelmed when you get there say Lord lead me to the Rock lead me to the Rock Jesus my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the Rock and that rock is Christ 1 Corinthians chapter 10 that rock that they that gave water that rock is Christ amen praise the Lord you know talking about being overwhelmed brother Chad he said he likes the fish I don't like the f I don't have the patience to fish I like 20 minutes blow up the damn catch them all you know I just this whole thing of lurs and sunlight no sunlight color I I just it overwhelms me I'm it just creates anxiety but so this one day it was really nice and I was out I come by this place I like to fish I got my fishing pole I was fishing with the Rapala two treble hooks and I was fishing along beautiful day the birds the little Ripple and I was just fishing just enjoying myself sometimes I'll listen to God's Prophet I caught this little bass about that long I was catching several I caught this one and so just as you begin to you know you hold the rod you begin to pull it up and these little bash just as you get them by the mouth and it kind of kind of paralyze them when you hold their mouth a certain way and just as I got him he thrashed like that and it buried the trouble hook in my finger the trouble Hook is means it's three hooks on the and they put two trouble hooks on every lur so the the the front one got him and the back one got me and so it it buried it in my finger and so I I caught him I H held him like this and every time he thrashed it would just um is this okay if I just share some personal things preachers go through things too Burley Williams was telling about his eye and everything he told the doctor all right so i' now I got this fish and I got the hook in my finger and I'm picking him up like this but every time he thrashed it just like ah so I'm holding my pole so then I'm like okay so I stuck my pole under my arm and I had to hold the fish with this hand and so I'm walking like this and I'm like how did I get here how did I get here I got this pole this fish thing in my finger and and I'm holding the bass like this and I I'm like I can't do anything this it was a pretty day I was having a good time you ever been there in your life and you're like how did I get here how did we get here I was trying to tell her a compliment on her food and and she just like this whole thing is a mess and then it went to social media and how how did I get here we live in a rural world and if God doesn't help us through the real world what good is he he's not way out there somewhere the word of God is not you even in your mouth Lord I need you I need you when I'm stuck and so I like all right I got to unravel all of this that happen in just a moment so I carry all this to my truck and I'm trying to get my tailgate open and I can't get my tailgate open I'm like okay so somehow I got my rod and I bit the line and I set my pole down so now I just have the fish and my finger like this and I'm like okay so I open the tailgate get in there get my tacle box pull it out get a knife or plier and I get it out and you know they have the split ring that holds the treble if you're fishing the split ring holds to so I get the split ring cuz I don't want to waste the the the other lur and damage it so I try to get this split ring off and finally get the lur separated now I just have this treble hook in my finger you know and when you get to there you ever been things like in life you're like I just like well I'll just forget about it I maybe it'll go away maybe it'll go away but there's just some things in life that aren't going to go away that you have to deal with with and God sometimes gets us in places where we realize God we need a God we need somebody that's bigger than us maybe a sickness maybe a problem in your marriage maybe a a problem with your children amen and then we're praying and maybe a problem in the church and you're praying I'm like Lord what do what do I I've got this hook and you know you think about your options I'll just cut the hook off and just leave a because it's buried all the way down to the curve I'll just leave that in there and I'll just leave it well you can it's you got to get that out like well maybe I'll go the hospital and they'll charge me $3 or $4,000 to get this out like well what are they going to do you know they're going to so I got me some pliers I'm trying to pull it and pull it and there was a barb you know what barbs are if you fish trout I think they make you take the Barb off it so it has a Barb and I'm trying to pull the Barb and it won't because it's hooked down in my finger and I'm pulling and like this isn't going to work you know so I realized you know what I'm going to have to take this thing through I can't pull it out so I got to pull it all the way through my fer and brother said he said that's right so I'm like if I go to the hospital they're just going to do this too and so I try to pull it through and it the the the fatty part of your flesh it wouldn't go through so I had to get another knife you know it's just like life some things you just got to go through you just got to go through it I mean all parents like I wish my kids would hit 10 and then they'd go right to 20 and they just like just jump right over there but no you're going to have to go through that they going to have to go through those years where they're trying to figure out and you know what you went through them I saw brother Les coli and sister Kelly and you know growing up and we all you know I was young and 15 years old when I first came to this area and 14 years old and brother Jeff and man such a pointed me to the message of the hour I'm so thankful for his influence to point me to the message of the hour we'd have altar calls at the camps and brother Jeff would come up right behind him said now everyone of you had an experience with God but you need to get into this message and feed on Christ the word of God to keep your experience of life I'm so thankful for his influence in my life and direct me to the message and so I here I am stuck with this thing in my finger and I realize I got to go through this so I got a knife and cut it on the other end and pushed it all the way through and got a pair of pliers and pulled it through and then I was through it I was through it and you know you know five minutes later I just rub it a little bit boom I'll fishing again it's and I was through it and that's the same with life maybe it's a sickness or a trouble that you go through but amen this this came to pass it says in the Bible someone this came to pass it didn't come to stay it came to pass can you say Amen to that you'll get through those teenage years you'll get through that sickness God's going to bring us through he's not going to forsake us so thankful for that in our lives in this journey of life I was thinking of this 2 Timothy 3:12 says all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution all that live Godly will suffer persecution so if you're not suffering persecution the Bible says all that live Godly will suffer persecution amen there's another place Jesus said Beware when all men speak well of you now this is the other side of the Gospel okay I I we we we I try to earn a living for a family we have a little company we're in sales and I understand the whole positive uh you know thinking and corporate seminars and motivational speeches and and things like that and then then people try to bring that right into the church and get religious jargon and and positive mental attitude I understand all of that that's the world I live in but we got to realize you know they try to bring it in the church I'm too blessed to be depressed I'm too anointed to be disappointed and as my wife said the other day I'm too I'm too inspired to be tired and that's all good but sometimes you go through an Affliction in your body or something in your mind and God is wanting to deal with you like job or maybe there's a conversation in heaven between God and Satan it said have you considered my servant job and Satan says yeah yeah but um you know he's just serving you for the Loaves and the fishes and all and so in one day he loses all of his family all of his possessions have you ever prayed God don't let me ever go through what job would go through until I have the character that job had and one day he loses everything Satan comes back to God and says you know yeah yeah you got a hedge around him oh I love that verse God has a hedge around a Believer amen the Bible says the angels are encamped around about those that fear Him Do you believe it I believe it because it's the word of God and I've learned that I believe the word of God when I don't feel like it I take the word of God and when he says the angels of God are encamped around about those that fear Him I believe it brother vham said they never leave they're always there he said they know your thoughts listen to me I heard the ver voice of God's Prophet it changed my life it changed my thinking I can't think like that because all the Angels know what I'm thinking hey we're having a good day aren't we to the angels yes we are Daniel be encouraged oh praise God we get down in the devils and start talking negative brother R said you're talking the devil's language when you do that I don't know a foreign language I'm still trying to conquer English but some people know German or French or whatever you know Opa I think is Romanian is water I think the OPA is is water and Romanian and and so and so these these words but now the prophet talks about the devil's language you start talking negative I guess I'll never make it a Son of God a daughter of God never make it wake up who are you if we're Sons and Daughters of God Jesus told his disciples he said I send you out a Among Wolves Heen see to be harmless as a dove but wise as a serpent and he said nothing shall by any means ever hurt you oh praise be to God we must realize who's in the ship we need need to go wake Jesus I hope this is encouraging us today man who called you to this why are you we need to go back to basics why are you in this church why why why why would just no no no why are you here God put a desire inside of you man as one man said I'm not going to church the holy spirit said I'm going he said okay just a minute let me get my coat and hat and I'll go with you and when he the Holy Spirit has come he will lead you and guide you into all truth we need to get away from our flesh and start yielding to the Holy Spirit say God lead me lead me to the house of God lead me to the word of God he'll never lead you away from the Bible he'll never lead you away from the word of God oh I love God he has characteristics God Is Knowing by his characteristics so many different things I was thinking about that it's just not religious jargon amen but this is how how can I say it um we we are lumps of clay in the hand of the Potter I was reading that no doubt your pro Pastor has going through it Jeremiah chapter 18 the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying arise go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words he said I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the Potter to make it I don't know if you've ever studied the Eastern style how they make the vessels and they have a little wheel and it spins like this and so as it begins to spin the master the Potter just touches it and it begins to shakee are you with me the master touches the lump of clay and it begins to shape it maybe as it spins and they touch it and then it it comes up and he pushes it and spinning and it grows taller and taller and then the Bible says that the lump fell off the potter's wheel you ever feel like you fell off the potter's wheel you just feel like ah and the Potter doesn't leave it there the pot the Bible says the Potter picked it up again and put it back on the Wheel you know what we need you know all this is written for our admonition when you fall off the potter's wheel don't lay there say Lord put me back on the potter's wheel put me back now you can get back on the potter's wheel but you have to listen to me you have to have the Potter to touch you to touch you that's right say Lord will you touch me this morning Lord feel like I've fallen off and my my testimon is mared my life is mared but that's not the end Lord I'm coming to your house put me back on The Potter's will and touch me Lord Jesus because every time God touches a lump of clay it shapes it and molds it to the image that is in the Master's The Potter's mind oh don't you love the Lord don't you feel like when you just talk about the Holy Spirit and now he just comes and he's just real close and how Paul said the the love of God constrains me man when I start to do it's not the the the ideology brother say said he had this idea too the Trinity he said the old man with the stick every time I do wrong the man old man with the stick like whack me and then Jesus loved me and he was a different I'm going to preach the Trinity Doctrine then there was another one the Trinity and Jesus loved me and then there was a little holy spirit that floated around to try to help me I'm going to I'm going to preach the Trinity okay so God the Father come up with this idea for an earth and then Adam and Eve messed it all up and he looked at his son and said Son go fix that go go give your life for this mess that created and holy spirit you go down there with him and and help comfort him that's the trinitarian idea but that's not what the Bible says the Bible says great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh God said I'll go down and fix it I'll go down and fix it he created a body and came down and lived inside of that body that which is conceived in you is of the Holy Ghost is this Matthew The Book of Matthew there and now God came down and created a body and wanted to know what it was like to be angry he wanted to know what it was like to be tempted he was tempted in all manner like as you are yet without sin I said was somebody here the other day and they're like well you don't know what I'm going through and Jesus and Living Single like he's not asking you to do anything he didn't do he's not asking you to do anything he didn't do when he came right down to the end and and he said if thou be tell us who hit you and they smoted him and he the Bible says he opened not his mouth listen to me really close why didn't he open his mouth and tell him your name is this and this and last week you committed adultery unless you repent of it you're going to hell why didn't he do that because there was a verse in the Bible over in Isaiah chapter 53 his Bible says and he opened not his mouth and he was so bound and constricted by the word of God it controlled his mouth oh brothers and sisters may God help us today we talk about the token we talk about the Holy Spirit I say Lord will you fill me today till I have that kind of character Lord it might we we think it's the opposite I get anointed and I open my mouth but now Jesus is Anointed and he keeps his mouth closed sometimes God's ways are not our ways some way we just need to say I don't know what to say so I'm not going to say anything there's great there's great wisdom in that there's great power in that a lot sometimes you get around people they get nervous and they just got to say something say something something say but there's great wisdom how's the Bible how's of Proverbs say it's better to remain silent and thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt so sometimes I tell people if you're just quiet people p perceive you as intelligent as just really analyzing and you understand and you're just trying to you know so may God help us to come to that place that God is controlling us controlling us Jesus knew when to make a whip and drive them out of the temple and he knew when to take a little baby up and hold him in his in his hand and he blessed the little children may God help us and give us wisdom but we're in the right place what is it uh James first chapter If any man lack wisdom let him ask God Lord help me I don't know how to do this I don't know how to raise children great wisdom I had the very honor and privilege of being raised in a Christian home and one day my dad sat me down as I think I was a teenager H he sat me down and said Son I've I've never done this before and I don't have a manual I'm trying to figure this out just like you're trying to figure this out let's figure it out together and when we don't figure it out let's go to God and say God help us we don't understand what this teenager is going through and Dad Mom you live some brother you got to think 18-year-old thoughts you got to think of their fears and their anxieties and what they're going through and then when we get later in life and we start going through things are do you understand I'm not going to preach that listen to the message indictment the first little bit brother R said you go through a change every seven years he said you got to bear with one another when you go through those years uh it's a whole another sermon but may God help us Amen brother random says this he's talking about Mary and Martha and Lazarus when Jesus went away from them when the sickness came to Lazarus he says this and when Jesus goes away from your home trouble will come in just remember when Jesus leaves your home look out for trouble that's right that's right this is somebody that's went down the road before us the other day I was going to church and one of the deacons text me said hey be careful and I65 it's all backed up you might try a different route so now here's a prophet he's telling us he's been down this road we see it in Lazarus now the prophet is saying when God leaves your house trouble happens this is Christ the word when the word of God leaves your house trouble happens I'm not going to leave the word of God he said trouble happens just remember that he said you better treat him right pray love him and keep him there cuz he's the best companion and friend you ever have or ever will so keep him there make him welcome live the kind of life that he would like to be associated with you this is great wisdom isn't it don't let him leave your house say you know have you been there before in your life maybe you've been away from the Lord you're like I know what it was before I had the Lord and now we've invited the Lord Jesus to come into our house and we're you know if something's got to go it's not going to be the Lord Jesus it's not going to be the presence of the Lord whatever that is it's to go remember brother bam said in the token message he said he said apply the token and kick the shorts and the and the television and the the cards and all those things out and you know what most people forget that because the next little party says because the token won't stand for it the Holy Spirit won't stand for those kind of evil things and the Holy Spirit is like hey it's me or them me or that and say hey all right that it's got to go do you believe that lord it's got to go cuz I want you it happened the other day I was watching a little something I was uh I don't remember it was YouTube or something I was watching something and and and a person cussed on the thing and I felt the Holy Spirit move away like Lord no no Lord no you stay here we'll get rid of that we'll move the other stuff are you with me today we'll move that away Lord you just stay here because we have to have you the family that prays together stays together amen and when Christ leave Trouble Comes brother Ram says this in the message things that are to be he said you were all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight he said did you know that he goes on to say you at one time was in your father and the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see when you were in put in the bedding ground in the womb of your mother through holy W wedlock and then you became a person expressed in the image like your father then there's Fellowship he goes on to say now the only way that you can be a son the daughter of God because you have to be the have have to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and he says you are nothing can you Jesus said that without me you can do nothing right so you have you realized that a lot of times people come to Christ like hey I got this I'm and God's like no I got to let you go through all that self-righteous self accomplishment I Until you realize you know lord I can't do this without you he said brother Daniel I can't be a Christian I can't live this you're at the perfect place for God to say but I can I'm not going to ask you something that I don't give you the power to do and if you're at that place today say Lord fill me with the Holy Spirit God give me your power Lord Give Me Your strength we're going to get into that in a little bit brother bam goes on to say you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light of this age you are the expressing God's life in you because you are a son and daughter of God you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation to the people to the neighborhood where you are associated oh I I thought I just came to God and and and the the Holy Spirit came to me to dodge hell no no that's not what God had in mind his mind was that you would be a Son of God a reflection of Christ on the earth the bride Christ in the bride form now being an expression to to the world to your neighborhood to your nation I say Lord help me help me to be the right kind of expression amen I tell you this will cure road rage little car cut you off like image of Christ reflection of Christ if we get a revelation it'll cure that brother bandam I've got a temper how do I get rid of my temper sweeten your temper with prayer sweeten your temper with prayer daddy daddy you need to go pray Lord help us today oh I thought I was coming to church we getting Starbucks and Crispy Cream Donuts and it was was all going to be no isn't feel good we're coming to be purged for anything that's not like Christ that's our desire when we go out Lord I want to be more like you I was thinking about this man he made a a sculptor he he had this image of of of Christ and he had this image and he made this of of Christ and it was just a big rock and he made this it was a beautiful reflection the the face of Jesus Christ and his hair and his nose and his ears and it was beautiful and people were admiring it said how how did you do that how did you do that he said it was really easy I had this big rock and he said I could see Christ in that rock and all I did was cut away everything that wasn't Christ it wasn't like he had to go create Christ he just cut away everything that wasn't Christ if you're a son and daughter of God God has in you I'm going to preach God's power of transformation he said inside of you is a seed and in that seed is the potentials to grow up and be what God wanted it to we just got to get everything that's not like Christ away from us I mean I think you just listen to it Masterpiece he said he the composer he pulled it up and and watered away many pieces of paper and he threw them away he said but out of that came a masterpiece of songs that were written you listened to the message right I think you were on part three masterpieces and God is as a masterpiece he had it in his mind before the foundation of the world you know is this okay here's the Here's the the the denominational idea of Salvation Jesus Christ comes down dies on the cross goes up to heaven 2,000 years people just hear about Christ and feel sorry for the man that hung on the cross and at the end he comes back and whoever stand and believe the story is is saved but that's not the Bible the Bible says the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost and you might not have been raised in a Christian home you might have your dad might have been an alcoholic oh brother Daniel don't bring it down home well we're talking about brother brandom's family right his daddy said most of our family died with their on they were just Fighters and killers and all that what made the difference it was the new birth in the brandom family and without the new birth in whatever family you go back to what your old old man was so there is none righteous know not one we've all got a nature of sin but the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost I'm going to preach the communion ready he said I was sitting on a log with my dog he said the snow he said a few months ago I was sitting here built a fire and there was flowers now there's snow and then the spring the the flower will come back he said what what was that he said I realized I wasn't the son of Charles and Ella brandom I was the son of God I was a Son of God I tell you what this will cure the old pity devil like well you don't understand my family and I was back there I I understand I understand all that but maybe you're not the son of those people maybe you're a son and daughter of almighty God and say Lord will you just cut away everything that's not like you just cut away everything that's not like you we to the great physician say Lord I here here I am that's right I'm going to preach my testimony all right I was a I was not a good person I was raised in a Christian home I was raised in the brandom Tabernacle went to Sunday school and the Sunday school brother R had the meetings with the questions and answers has them all back in there and talking to the brothers he's in my Sunday school room with brother Jackson and brother Neville and brother Collins and they're recording the message I think uh Church order in my Sunday school room I came through that went to the other Sunday school room and but I got a got and got a drifted away from the Lord and just little things come in and and so I remember there my dad made great sacrifices sent me to a Christian School and one day I was in the school and and some things happened and I said something and the the my art teacher looked at me she said Daniel you have the filthiest mouth in this school like oh God oh God what a mess I've made of my life my testimony of everything I've just made made a mess you know it's like Moses he knew he was the deliverer he was the seat of God and you're going to be the deliver and he went out and all he had was a stinking testimony two dead men it was a stinking testimony so somewhere he went away and sometimes people do that they just like I'm out of here I'm going away he went married somebody had a baby started a new career but God came looking for him he came looking for him and there was something Supernatural that happened as brother Ram said what Abraham what Moses lacked was in the burning bush amen what I lacked was in Christ one day they had the youth camp and I was a 14-year-old boy I was sitting about where a brother is in the blue shirt I was sitting there brother Hilton brand he didn't even give an altar call at the end of they just got up and they would sing some songs at the end but God was dealing with my heart God he will he will find you he will find you I don't know why I'm saying this today am man you remember Peter after he denied Christ and Christ he rose and now he's not there they couldn't see him and Peter said I go fishing I'm just going back to what I used to do how many people do that something happens they fall off the powder's will I say I I'm go I go fishing and he started influencing others remember the other disciple says we go with you we go back to our old life too well they just needed Christ but Christ came and he found them wherever they were Christ came and found them they're fishing and they said oh it's Christ and then he came and did the supernatural that's what we need is the supernatural God to somewhere get our attention brother Chad giving me his testimony he didn't have the privilege that I had and raised and all the things and right and you know and and so here I'm sitting there but God's dealing with my heart and I got up and I walked to an altar and I knelt down and said Lord this is all I got it's a mess but it's all I got and somewhere God came and he touched my heart he changed my heart and every individual needs that time with god brother said I doubt a DED dyed confession I'm talking about it many years later and it brings tears to my eyes because something happened I can't explain it I don't know all about it I've had ministers meetings and the debates and all that I can't explain it all I know is it's real amen it's real it's not a myth it's not a theory it's something you experience Jesus Christ and he comes to you wherever you are now he loves you too much to leave you that way you know the Bible says he shall save men from their sins that's why we see a lot of this charismatic them they come to Christ and they go on with the same dress the same music and but that's not what the Bible says the Bible says and he shall save his people from their sins they that are in Christ are a new creature old things have passed away I don't doubt you might dance because David danced before the Lord and maram danced but it won't be the way that the old dance in the world with the music and all that stuff of the world are you with me today I won't down I I don't doubt that you'll shout but it'll be about the things of God and not about the things of the world I don't doubt you'll drink but you won't stop drinking you just drink the right kind of stuff the Bible says be not drunk with wine but be filled with the Holy Spirit that's just a perversion of what the Holy Ghost ought to do in our life we become overwhelmed we become filled with the Holy Ghost and we love the Lord with all of our heart with all of our soul with all of our might it's a reality in Jesus Christ then I went back and told the girl said hey we can't do this relationship anymore because I met Jesus Christ and I can't listen to that music and I went from not caring about the things of God to being on the front row of the church because something happened in my life there will be a change that will happen to you how many know what I'm talking about things that are to be amen stay with me we keep getting off I don't know whe that's for somebody today none of that's in my notes so God is going down he he's a great physician he goes down every Pew to touch every one of us all right I might preach loud I might even misquote a scripture and you know but but if we might have a Critic Among Us you know I found brother Chad you can preach a perfect sermon have all the scriptures illustrations the quotes all in order and the critic gets nothing so I always try to do a little something a little mistake in there so when the critic goes out like yep you misquoted that verse you were a little loud tonight deacons know what I'm talking about they go man it was cold in church I'm glad you got something out of the service we want everybody to go away with something today it's good to laugh a little bit Jesus said go tell Herod that fox up there you know and you know the Bible says that that that uh that laughter is good it's like a medicine am me it does good brother maram told Rebecca that he told her whenever they'd lose their temper he'd make them laugh at themselves he'd make them laugh they just it's ridiculous but you know he' just make them laugh laughter is good it's like a medicine it'll heal you praise the Lord things that ought to be is this okay maybe you're journeying through life here's a couple things let me throw this out there Malachi 4:5 the Bible says that behold I send you El elah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so the Bible says before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he's going to send Elijah the prophet and he'll turn their hearts back to the Faith of Our Fathers in the seals my wife and I are going through the seals it's almost invariably brother B says he's turned the the faith their faith back to the their hearts back to the faith of our original fathers it's the faith the word of God and another thing I want you to understand he said he didn't wasn't going to turn our heads back he's going to turn our hearts back good heartfelt religion it's more than something with your head you know all the doctrines but now it becomes a revelation to you brother B didn't bring a bunch of head knowledge he brought a revelation you take every one of those take the message he that is in you brother brandom comes and he tells he gives the five identifications of the third pool and the storm turning back and Hatty right I mean and then and and all these things I mean these people the squirrels being created his wife with the tumor all of those things I want you to understand this was not William brandom doing it it was God telling him to do it so we need to get this out of our head we're going to become this great no brother brandom's he tells all the people when the storm comes run out of the storm because you're going to die and he does the same thing he's running out of the storm and God stops him says hey go back into the storm he said I knew it was sure death and he started going back into the storm and then God spoke to him and said now tell that storm to go back where it came from he's hunting squirrels people think brother went out like hey I'm going to create some squirrels no he's hunting the angel of the Lord comes says what do you have need of he said he was thinking of that scripture what's other things you desire and speak from your heart he said what do you desire brother Ram said I don't need anything he said well what are you doing he said I'm hunting he said well don't you need squirrels well you should ask and he tells him and he says well just say there and and God used William randam to create a squirrel and God is in his people too and whatsoever things you desire amen whatsoever things you have need of when you when you pray believe it and you shall have what you ask for even today maybe you desire something Jesus said you have not because you ask not somewhere we need to ask Lord I have need of this Lord will you change this situation I know the doctor told you you're going to have it the rest of your life but what about God what about the supernatural what about all things are possible what about they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what about they shall anoint with oil and pray the prayer of faith and the Lord shall raise them up is that the word of God and the Lord shall raise them up and I like this part too brother Chad and the Bible says if they have committed sins it will be forgiven them oh the word of God is so powerful as I Journey this life I've learned not to worry about what's around me but just keep following the road amen keep following the road map of God's word and don't worry about whatever I know we got those people what are they um rubber neckers like something somebody's tire and they like and you get this backup why people are rubber necking a guy has a flat tire we got too many rubberneckers we just need to take the word of God and just believe the word of God and and follow the word of God here here some Year back some man living in adultery and they had him up and was preaching and like man has everybody forgot their Bibles that there's qualifications to be in a minister it be the husband of one wife has our message people actually just laid their Bible down and we've created a movement brother said that was AR rising in the sun he said I'm afraid a pat Prophet is afraid he said I'm afraid we're getting people to a theory we're getting people to a church but we're not getting them to Jesus Christ I say Lord I want to get to Jesus Christ I want to know him in the power of his resurrection is that your desire Lord I want to know you in the power of your Resurrection but that's not all that verse and in The Fellowship of his sufferings oh we all like the power but what about the sufferings and now you're suffering and groaning through things that the prophet had to go through I I know he had a Ministry Angel of the Lord come no man will stand before you all the days of your life oh some of us if we had that invest in us we'd just walk around with the big head and now the Lord takes him through trials allow his baby to be taken his wife to be taken because he disobeyed and wouldn't go to the Pentecostal people went to Africa the ministers they got him there they had him trapped he gives in Africa and he said we're going to go to the city he said the angel of the Lord told me to go to this city he said well you can't go you don't have a car you don't have anything so he they start going to the other city and he gets him out I don't know if you know the testimony brother B Billy Paul he was 16-year-old boy brother B stops the pade gets them all out lines them up on the road he takes dirt throws it up on their feet every one of the brothers feet he said the angel the Lord told me to go to this city you're making me go to this city he said I don't have money I don't have a car I have no way out you have me trapped he said we're going to go there and God will bless it but we're all going to pay for it brother ROM comes back to America for a month he's sick with the amoeba and brother brandom said I learned no matter what anybody tells me I always obey the angel of the Lord and the word of God you as a Christian have you got that far in your life maybe you made a mistake and Jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered and have you learned obedience by the things that you've suffered well I'll just go do that anyway it doesn't matter nobody's watching and all of a sudden God though if he is your father as many as I love I chasen and I rebuke are you with me and all of a sudden you go through some type of mental maybe an oppression or something and you get down and pray like well what about back here when you got away from me yes what about you driving 100 miles an hour through that Road had all those pothos on it and now you got to sit over there and change your struts in your car why because you RAC through the the road that had the poose and sometimes we get racing through life and young people you start being disrespectful and I got it and I like but the Bible says honor your father and mother submit yourself one to another oh may God help us none of that's in my notes but I pray that it would help us now a prophet is learning obedience and we learn obedience think about this in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished come out of her my people Revelations 18 do you realize that you're fulfilling those scriptures today by sitting in this church Min and denominations I I got so much in my heart brother CH we have forgotten where we came from I think I was here nine years ago and we said look we can't pull the rug out from underneath this church has been built on the foundation of the Supernatural and William brandom coming to Sister Yanks and the prayer line and and the brother Dow and his heart attack and brother Brandon praying for him and the supernatural that this we can't pull the rug out from under underneath those things how many understand what I'm saying I mean we're built and we're built up in the Most Holy Faith and God has sent a message in this day so we're sitting here fulfilling Revelation 18 come out of her my people back in the 60s people were in denominations you know brother Perry green I just was in Arizona Tucson they're all in denominations they hear a voice and they come out of the denominations and now there's this thing called the message and people are listening listening to The Prophet's messages and so many times now the the prophet has gone on and and then people are getting away from listening to the messages of William brandom we think it's about a big church or a website or it's about a good preacher as my one friend was in Pentecost he said you know whichever preacher had the prettiest wife and she sang the best and he sweated the most and could quote the most scriptures and have a good memory that's who he followed but then God sent a prophet in our day that's right and he was a Divine interpreter of the word and God came and Vindicated a message with thousands and thousands would line up and he would tell them their names and their address oh well that doesn't mean anything sure meant a lot to the woman at the well go get your husband I don't have a husband you've had five and the one that you live with now is not sure she said I know when Messiah comes he'll do what you just did he said I'm he Philip found Nathaniel behold an Israelite in whom there is no G how did you know he said before Philip called you I saw you under the tree praying he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God predestinated seeds identify the sign of the Messiah in the Bible now unbelievers it meant nothing to them whenever they got to something except you eat my flesh and drink my blood they couldn't explain it they just walked away this is a hard saying I don't understand it and Jesus looked at Peter said you going to go too he said Lord where would I go thou alone has the words of eternal life praise be to God God is so good thinking about this go move quickly here I can't see that clock in the back but some of the things here that will happen in the last days you don't have to turn it second Timothy you might just write those Down 2 Timothy 3:1 the Bible says in the last days perilous times shall come we're living in those days perilous means exposed to imminent risk of disaster or ruin you feel like Lord perilous times I'm exposed to imminent danger and ruin you mean you could take 30 years to build your testimony and your child see you in front of a computer looking at certain things and your whole testimony of 30 years could be wiped out are you with me you know the Bible talks about Powers coming out of the out of the Revelation a beast was a power it came out there was a beast that came up the Roman Catholic Church came out of the people out of the waters there was another one that came out of land Revelations chapter 13 that was America she spoke she she came up as a lamb but she began to speak as a dragon America will begin to speak as a dragon but I wonder about the Beast of Google what about the Beast of apple and it raised and covers the whole earth and there's such a power even a president they ban a president change a presidency over these Powers amen the Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but about against principalities and Powers wickedness in high places I say Lord give me the holy spirit because the Bible says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world perilous times they're here this is the last days he goes on to say men shall wax worse and worse we're seeing this day the these scriptures are being fulfilled it shouldn't surprise us we should say no my road map is exactly right road map said that scoffers would come in the last days that second Tim 2 Peter 3:3 in the last days scoffers should come they would scul at you in your faith in just as they did Noah in Noah's day there's no rain up there I can prove to you we Shot Rock ups there's no and then God and the door shut we're getting close to that time yes sir brother R said when the gospel is not as effective as it used to be let me just stop right here and say we moved to a new church here a few years ago in in downtown Louisville it was a bad area town we put a speaker outside and a deacon had to stay outside and and watch over the cars and things like that I was out there for two years and let me say this preaching just like this we would just pipe the audio video we just pipe it out put the speaker on the street there wasn't one person that ever came inside the church hearing the gospel being preached on the street not one we're entering into a time brother R said the gospel will become ineffective it doesn't move people there's too many they got that you know we we're just going through the seals the the four horse riders and the last one was The Pale Horse it was all mixed up together and death followed it and you see people you talk and talking to them and their eyes kind of get that glazed over look it's that pale horse rider spiritual death be you know what I'm talking about you see people once go to church on fire for God love God and then you talk to him like well I don't know today's the Super Bowl I don't know if I'm going to church or or not the God of this evil age and they'll go there and they'll worship and they'll shout and they'll praise their God now you know people ball games whatever you you have a pastor he'll lead and guide you I'll just say this your first emotion should go to Jesus Christ you might cheer for Johnny hitting a home run but when you get in church you better really cheer for Jesus that hit it out of the park one day when there was no man worthy and he came and took the book out of him that sat on the and there was praise and honor and Glory went up for the great one Jesus Christ amen that's where I want my praise and my glory and my honor go to Jesus Christ because no man was worthy but one Jesus Christ he looked he said I heard a a lion speak fear not for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed he said I looked to see a lion he saw a bleeding lamb that's right he was bleeding he was Bloody why for your sins for my sins he is interceding for me when that teacher said you have the filthiest mouth in the school it was because I had a a lamb amen it wasn't Chad lam it was the Lamb of God and I believe brother Chad Lam is trying to point you like John the Baptist said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world Amen because blood of bulls and goats I mean we're in Hebrews now the blood of bulls and goats would never take it away it would just cover it up amen but what there was coming a lamb that would take away the sins of the world aren't you glad today the lamb has come and taking away your sins we're made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ Christ The Mystery of God revealed what is the new birth brother random Jesus Christ personally revealed to you listen to me this is not group therapy you know we have brothers and we love one another but this is an individual thing where you hear the gospel amen we're all all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and the wages of sin are death and go right down the Roman Road but the gift of God is eternal ET life through Jesus Christ Our Lord whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord he's going to be saved I'm not calling you to a church Theory or a church doctrine I'm not even calling you to the message cliche I'm calling you to Jesus Christ to Christ and that Christ will lead you and begin to guide you so I knelt there at the altar I was back here a few years ago and took a picture of it printed I got it hanging in my office it wasn't everything but it was a starting place somewhere you got to start somewhere you got to meet Christ and be done with the world and the things of the world hey this thing works man I'm not here telling you a theory this thing works it'll cure teenage rebellion Rebellion it'll cure drugs and alcohol it'll cure DUIs the other day my son came to me and said Dad what's a DUI I like oh blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord he didn't learn that in a prison somewhere so being drugg in there after drinking or what whatever and hey this is your DUI you're drinking well under the influence of something oh brothers and sisters this thing is good amen David said oh taste and see that the Lord is good amen this is not a bunch of dos and don'ts this is not that's what the Devil Comes remember he came to Eve he said you know God doesn't want you to partake of that CU he knows if you're on this side you'll be wise as Gods God's depriving you that's what the devil said God's depriving you you should cut your hair you'll be more popular in school everybody if you wear those clothes a little tighter man more guys will look at you and your chances of getting married will be way way they'll go way up and you're single because you're no no that's the devil amen that the the holy spirit is creating a protection around you that only the boy that has the Holy Spirit would say that's the kind of girl I'm looking for she has modest apparel that's what I want because that is a reflection of what's inside of me you watch these boys cuz the boys is you know hey let's just go there all right we're not doing a youth thing but we'll do a youth thing right we see these boys and you know maybe the trends of the ladies change but the boy maybe they're cutting out it's not the all long hair and and they look like what but what's inside I'm going to preach choosing a bride right here watch what a boy chooses and it shows what's down inside of him and he goes and chooses that girls because he's not right with God Amen may God help us praise be to God we better move right along okay let's go to Romans the first chapter is this okay this is the word of God as long as I stay in my Bible I'm good that's why I believe this message it's in the Bible you you say I don't believe the message well you're throwing out the Bible to tell me who is restoring our hearts back to the Faith of Our Fathers amen praise the Lord Romans the first chapter this is a lot going on here but I this is what we you say the one man said I don't know what I want to do in life but I know what I don't want to do I'm going to show you something you don't want to do okay Romans the 1st chapter verse 24 don't have time to read the whole thing but the Bible says they stting to worship the creation more than the Creator they start worshiping the the the football players more than they worship the god that created the football players is that all right I tell you those people aren't worshippers they love but they love the God of this evil age and so the Bible says right here verse 24 Romans 1:24 wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness oh I was born like this don't doubt you were born like that oh we had these genes in our family and because they believe that and they create a culture is everybody with me and they pass laws and all this God gave them up to uncleanness is that what your Bible says I want I say Lord don't give me up to uncleanness I was sitting with somebody the other day and say you know I know I'm doing wrong and I'm living like that but what at least my conscience isn't seared I'm like if you're continuing sin how was it it says in it was it Galatians there shall we continue in grace that shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound no God came to save us from our sins God gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts the dishonoring of their bodies between themselves I know we're going to talk to the young people in a few hours but this is good for all of us right here we see a culture that's changing I want you to see what the Bible talks about this same-sex marriage and homosexuality and lgbqt question mark whatever it is there's I think there's 16 genders now they they have there it's confusion it's what the Bible says it's confusion but look at these words the Bible calls it uncleanness it calls it lust he calls it dishonor is that what your Bible says it doesn't change can't change our opinions with the changing of times if we believe the Bible now if we throw the way the Bible then we can change our culture and change our churches but as long as it's in the Bible oh there's such power in the word of God Amen the word of God is quick and it's powerful amen verse 25 who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up you know I don't know what I want to do in life but I know what I don't want to do and I never want to get to the place where God gives you up like aren't you glad God didn't give up on you God did we shouldn't give up on each other either but the Bible says there comes a place where God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature so the Bible calls it vile affections verse 26 verse 27 likewise also the men leaving the the natural use of the woman burned in their F in their lust one towards another men with men working that which is unseemly so look what the Bible is saying it's vile affections it's not natural it's a lust it's unseemly working in themselves that recompense of their he which is met and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge think about that we did not like to retain the word of God we did not like to retain the word of God in our minds what happened to those people God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient then he goes through a whole list of things that happen after God gives you up all of these things happen but down in the last verse of verse 32 who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them brother Daniel I don't like you I was just reading the road map just reading the road map you can shoot the messenger and you can Stone Steven but you can't change the truth amen I'm just pointing you to the road map this is what the word of God says as as as long as I stay behind that amen I'm good and the Bible says in another place I think it's Ephesians chapter you and such were some of you but you've been washed but you've been Sanctified he goes on here chapter 2 it's really interesting uh it goes down in verse number four of chapter 2 or despises thou The Riches of his goodness and the forbearance of his longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God God leadth thee to repentance is that what your Bible says and somewhere we might have even been in the same place and the goodness of God begin to lead you hey this isn't natural this is vile affections and something inside you you you you believe in being led of the Holy Spirit the Bible says as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God not that they can explain it remember those two little God needed two zebras in the ark and these men built this big thing it's not natural right you some of you do we have hunters in here anybody a hunter and they build this big Ark and they have this dark wait the ark is just a few things down the road if you've been to the ark and they B the replica and now it's this big up on a hill and there's a just big this big black hole with the ramp going up and two zebras are in a herd of zebras and something moves over zebra like I don't know what noise zebras make my little grandbaby probably know but something began to move in this one zebra to go into that thing up on the hill right and there was just one other person in their herd that felt the same thing but nobody else did and over with the turkeys and over with the donkeys something just too like I'm not going to worry about who's around me I feel led by the Holy Spirit to go in that we have an Ark of Safety it's the word of God Amen I feel led to dedicate my life to the word of God I feel led to shun the very appearance of evil I I feel led to to to resist the devil and he'll flee from me is somebody with me I feel led to draw nigh unto God I feel led to lift my hands and Worship the Lord how do he say in Timothy I would that men lift up holy hands I feel led to dress in modest apparel as a woman and if a woman's got to do it wouldn't it be good for us men too run around naked in a basketball and a little brother I'll preach God's power of transformation right here a little going out people like oh that's brother Brandon's Pion I like that well wait a minute wait a minute the prophet of God is looking at Spirits he's not looking at your shorts he's looking at a spirit and identifying that's a manifestation of your that that the shorts are a manifestation of your spirit oh brother Daniel let me give you a little illustration you come home from work and that little guys out there with this mower like little short brother said you're identifying a right there so I ask any of them go up and ask them hey let me ask you something you go to church yeah hey I'm a Christian I love God let me ask ask a question are you a man enough to go tell your wife that she needs to to dress modestly and not to cut her hair and are you a man enough to go to a church that baptizes in the name of Jesus Christ and not in the Trinity of Father Son and Holy Spirit which is not a part of the Bible Well I could never do that well why can't you cuz my wife won't lay at me and their family you stand up and be a man say we're going to dress right in this house and we're going to go to a church that believes in baptism in Jesus is this okay prophet of God is identifying a spirit I'd like to see a real man he may not make a lot of money he may not be real smart but he says I believe the word of God and I'm going to be a man and we're going to go to the house of God I'm going to lift my hands and worship God and I'm not perfect is it all right to say that that takes a real man to say I'm not perfect and when I make a mistake I'm going to go down to the Altar and kneel tell my family look I made a mistake daddy did wrong daddy did wrong I don't think there's any shame in that we're in uncharted waters we see things all around us in the virtual world the internets and the house and all these things virtually just coming like and there's no virtue say there's no shame and say I started down the wrong road but the holy spirit is leading me to come back to the path and I'm lead my family in the paths of righteousness is that okay and I you know I tell you what sometimes you Lo this just comes from 35 years of marriage right here okay sometimes you lose the trust to your wife or your family but there's nothing that brings that trust back like seeing in an Open Bible in a man kneeling down with his face in his Bible saying God help me God let me lead my family right let me be a godly man let me lead my children Lord when I make a mistake God forgive me let me lead them right Lord their souls are in my hand I've got to answer for them we'll stop right here right remember brother Ram said the woman will never answer for the husband but the husband will answer for the wife and for the children he says children we need to listen to Daddy because he's got to answer for us at the day of judgment we just need to stand behind daddy whatever he feels if it's going in the right direction is this okay may God help us and may the fear of God come back in our homes come back in our families May the pillar of fire amen Jesus amen the word became flesh remember in the beginning was the word with word was with God the Word was God that's St John 1:1 ver14 and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us you know some people have to make a silhouette of Jesus and let him sit in your house it would change the way we talked and the thing but if we by Revelation realize Christ is here he's with us as one brother he preached a sermon and brother asked him later he said would you have preached that if William Brandon was sitting on the front row of the church like no I don't think I would have said that well what about Christ being here today what about me putting a guard I think it was he put a guard over his mouth my we're covering a lot of things today aren't we may the Lord help us have you heard of the influencers on social media yall are smiling some of you some you don't know what I'm talking about some of you do so they have in influencers on Instagram and Facebook and YouTube and those those things and people millions of followers and then somebody pays them money to point people to a corporation or to point people to a product or to lead Society in a certain way because they have gain and I thought about that because they have such power the power of the internet or the power of social media and the these people become very powerful and I thought about that because Jesus wants influencers too amen but these these people he said without me you can't do anything so they have to have Jesus to be an influencer so Jesus said in Acts the first chapter remember Peter he gave him the Keys of the Kingdom he turned it up to be nothing but a cussing preacher and denied Christ and so he told him acts 1 18 He said I want you to go to the city of Jerusalem and I want you to T there and you'll be endued with a power from on high it'll be the holy spirit that will come and give you a power and me Acts 2 after Peter got it he said repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you shall receive this power inside of you and he said after you get this power then you'll be my Witnesses then you'll be my influencers you know if we get if we read our Bible and let the Holy Spirit speak to us we won't be drawn away to be like the world we say I don't need to be an influencer for the devil because God has already employed me to be an influencer for Jesus Christ I say God Endo me again this morning with the power from on high Lord I want to be an influencer maybe I've got away from the power and my influence Jesus said about the salt if the salt has lost its savior it is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and and we lose our influence as a Christian that's why they said I could never be on social media they said you can't get on there and be preachy you can't be preachy you can't this is just like everybody's good like you can't like and and so you know hey I don't know it's in the Bible so I think it's James right there in James whosoever is a friend of the world has become an enemy of God so when those people are dressed immoral and doing immoral things and you click like and you become a friend you have just become a an enemy of almighty God and you've lost your influence as an influence in the kingdom of God remember brother Brandon he went to that little garage tell them about Christ the owner come out and said William brandom you're welcome here anytime as a man but you your Jesus Christ isn't welcome he made these amazing statements he said wherever Jesus Christ is not welcome I'm not welcome and brother Brandon Walks out of the garage a few minutes later the man is walking around the curb and it's icy he slips off and a truck runs over top of him and mashes his body brother Ram said I wonder if he would want Jesus Christ in that time there's coming a Time this the the the the the scripture says that the mountain the the rocks and the mountains will will the the people will cry is it right if we just talk about reality here I don't like people to scare me but I do like to know the truth okay I do like to know the truth so I was reading over there in in in in the book of of in The Sixth Seal my wife and I are going through the Sixth Seal and the Bible says that the that the uh that the the the rich man and all the Great Men they'll cry for the rocks and the mountains say fall on us and hide from the face of him that sth on the throne from the Wrath of the Lamb this is what the road map says is coming I don't like to be scared I don't like people scaring me and putting the fear tactics and some of you all maybe that's what you do for a living like hey you buy by tonight it's 20% off if you don't do it tomorrow and the Dinger you're not getting it I don't like that I just wait till tomorrow and pay the extra 20% because I want to make a decision my mind is just will you bear will you give me a few more minutes and sometimes brother that's why brother BR he wasn't against altar calls people coming because in the Bible all great Patriarchs built an altar you go through every time they met God they built an altar and we should be building altars continually it's not I'm going up to get saved again I'm going to build an altar and rededicate my heart to Jesus Christ brother Brandon wasn't against alter Calla he was against the emotion of you don't you'll never see Granny if you don't get up here don't you want to see gran and it's an emotion I don't like that just tell me the facts you're going there's only two places to go heaven or hell those are the facts it's appointed under man wants to die that's the easy part after that's the Judgment Lord help me I'm coming to that judgment Lord let me make brother M said we come with all sanness and soberness I had I have so many experiences one time I was at a youth camp and they preached a message called God will burn your barley fields have you ever heard and they did that back in the day they would preach on God will burn your barleyfields talking about Samson and when they didn't come he went he lit the foxes and he burned God and God's going to burn your barley fields and you're not you're going to have a car wreck and you're going to this and this Minister you know you go through things in life and it leaves like a little scar on you I was at a youth camp and this man started doing the countdown 10 if you're lost and you're not at this altar when I get to one you're lost and God's going to burn your barley fields and you're going to hell nine it and I was like sitting like right you know where you're in a service and something happens and you're scarred for life and I was sitting there and I was in like Lord Jesus this isn't happening this man is taking 10year olds and bringing the fear of hell and they got to do it in 10 seconds I've got to make a d a a destination for my soul in 10 seconds Lord God and then I hear a prophet said no it's not based on an emotion it's based on come sanely and soberly to the word of God and realize you're a sinner and there's only one place to go and it's appointed unto man want to die and the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lorden I don't need 10 seconds on that I just need his holy spirit to say Daniel I'm the way I'm the truth I'm life come to me all you that are weary and heavy laden and I got up from my chair and walked to the Altar and I knelt down it was between me and him and I can't explain everything that happened there but something changed in my life it changed the course of my life forever and God I keep going back to that maybe there's somebody here that you need to make that decision for Christ not under fear but the Holy Spirit dealing with you and dealing with amen as many as the father loves he chastens and rebukes I love that Jesus said and I won't lose one of them there was a group of names that written on the Lamb's Book of Life and you can run but you can't hide Samson tried to run he gave his he gave his heart to God but he gave his strength to Delilah how'd that work out for him and one day when he was grinding at the meal and going around and around he realized you know what there's a better life prodical Sons out there he had it all and he threw it all way there's a better life he said I'll arise and go back to my father's house you know what I'll go back to the Potter will and let God touch my life amen it might cause tears to come out of your eyes that's not a bad thing God said a broken and a contrite heart I'll never despise I'll never turn it away and when you look at the the road map it says in Revelations chap 6 that the rocks and the mountains are going to fall this is reality they're going to follow they'll cry let them fall on us and hide us from the Wrath of the Lamb this is Revelation 6 verse 17 for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand brother random says this in a message uh in the message former and latter rain I was listening to the other day he said you don't have to be drunk upon wine the only thing you have to be drunk on tonight is the things of the world he's talking about Nebuchadnezzar and they were had their drunken party he was talking about Pearl Harbor they're having the drunken party and the Japanese come up now he's talking about America and the destruction that lays ahead you know brother B tells us that he said Russia has a bomb with your name on it you see all these prophecies are laying oh there never was a prophecy no look at these prophecies there's Russia has a bomb with your name on it I don't have it printed here the seven visions of brother brandom in 1933 that he begins to tell about miscellany invading he tells about the the cars driving this is 1933 just the square Model A and he says there's going to be cars coming they'll drive there won't even be somebody and now the Google car yeah it's a Google car it drivve no no no wait you're going back 90 years and a prophet is telling you this is coming in the midst of a spiritual Revival we were talking about the other day spiritual Revival and Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and AA Allen and and and and Jack Cole and all those tent revivals everywhere and brother R has the vision said the moral plot of women will go to filthy and he said I almost see him as naked just a little fig leaf and we see that all around us today it's everywhere and and then he has a vision he said I see a woman rising in power it may be the Roman Catholic Church he said rising to power let me stop right there because I think it's um rejected King right there in 1960 when they elected John F Kennedy there never was a Catholic President and then John F Kennedy was elected right then brother R said he won't have much effect now but as Watch What Happens later down the road and now we see our Senate and Congress the the Catholics influences has he said it may be the Catholic church or their influence or he said a a president or vice president that is a woman in that day was like we're just letting them vote back and now we see a vice president these prophecies have been fulfilled if the six of them were fulfilled the seventh Vision was America was in ashes I American ashes are we sound people today we're listening to a Vindicated message and we must keep that in mind we've had unprecedented listen to me we talk to the businessmen and you young men we've had unprecedented prosperity in America inflation what 2 3% and now it's starting like oh inflation interest rate six or no it used to be 18 way back in Jimmy Carter way back there we've had unprecedented prosperian and so when you come along and say the prophet of God saw an like oh you're crazy you're just an old fogy I'm no I've been reading the road map I've been reading the road map the rocks and the mountains they'll cry for them to fall on us is this okay I'll never be popular money women popularity I'll never have a problem with popularity as long as I preach like this but it's reality if there's if there's potholes in the road up there I want to know it so when I get there I I I I gauge my life accordingly and so when I know that America is going to be in ashes I don't lay up Treasures on Earth where moss and rust do corrupt but I lay up Treasures in Heaven where moth and rust do not corrupt and where thieves do not break through and steal that's what we're doing this morning we're laying up Treasures in Heaven the other day we're we lease a building we're in the building and the wind was blowing it was like 50 mph winds and the wind was blowing we had some Le pieces of metal that aren't screwed in all the way down and they were thrashing bad and somebody come in said hey that other building the the the the winds the metal could fly off and hit our cars and I'm sitting there and it's blowing blowing and I all of a sudden this scripture begins to come to my mind and I was thinking about those things and then you start mixing you know an earthquake like oh we just had a little trimmer but now an earthquake for 2 minutes you can't stand up and you're laying on the ground and now the wind's maybe 150 M an hour and now volcanoes are coming up out of the earth and now Thunder have you heard lightning oh that was that was that was neat lightning I see the lightning and then I wait count the seconds it's that's how many miles away it is right oh that's really neat but now unending lightning and thunder and if you read in the Bible it says the the the the the clouds roll like a scroll I don't know if that's nuclear Powers dropping in the like you see the mushroom and the and the clouds I don't know but the Bible tells it's coming and the rich men the the Elon Musk and the Trump and the gates and all those people are crying let the Rocks fall on us for the Wrath of the Lamb is coming brother B says in another place it's a total Interruption of nature everything that's that's not natural no it's the Wrath of the Lamb that's why the Bible says I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord there's a great and Dreadful day of the Lord I'm not here to scare people but I I am here to bury you the tidings that when you get up on that road there's there there's potholes there there is a great and Dreadful day of the Lord that's coming and I don't want to be a part of that but I have a promise you shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you'll be caught up to meet the Lord himself amen the Bible says and the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout which is a message I'm going to preach the Rapture message right here in 30 seconds or less she'll descend from heaven with the shout which is a message brother Ram said it was the bread of life going over the Earth to gather the bride of Christ together are you with me today amen we're trying to escape the great Wrath of the Lamb that's coming that's promised that God sent a prophet and now there was a shout there was a message that people were feeding on the bread of life are you feeding on it amen we should be feeding on it Church age book I doubt that there's one Ministry that has the ability to turn the hearts back to the Faith of Our Fathers but the ministry of of of Malachi 4 which was the ministry of William random we should be listening don't let people tell you oh those preachers they're trying to get people away from the message no you're listening to one that's telling you you need to go listen to The Prophet's message remember the first Forerunner he was the one that said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world but there were other people saying hey there's John there's John we have an Elijah Minister comes our day but we've got a lamb here today brother Chad Lamb say listen to The Prophet's message amen you should value a preacher that's not ashamed to say listen to them there's 1,200 of them and he doesn't go through like don't listen to this one don't listen to this no there they are they were spoken public places you should be able to listen to them oh praise the Lord amen I say God bless brother Joseph brand that made the table app available that I could listen to him wherever I am that's a blessing right it's a blessing brother Brandon when he dedicated him five times in his dedication he said God let him be a blessing let him be a blessing I say this day that prophecy is fulfilled when I listen to the table Apper have the thing that Brother Joseph brandham is a blessing to the Bride of Jesus Christ is that fair is that having respect unto giving honor to whom honor is due sometimes we there's a big problem that we have even in our marriages when we disagree with somebody we can't say I love you because there's this one thing that we disagree on we need to be bigger than that one thing we need to be bigger than that that's good for the church maybe a deacon a trustee we disagree and everything in whole life is just about this I just preached I was a deacon for 13 years been at the same church for 35 years this is just stuff right when you drive into the church and you drive into the parking lot all you can hear is the problem with the Pew or the problem with this or the Sunday school or that Sunday it's just human nature right and after a while you have to be bigger than whatever that is say Lord really takes the dads to be the men of like we're going to drive in we're going to park between the lines we're going to get out we're going to go into that place we're going to lift our hands and worship God we're going to confess our sins we're going to draw nigh into God and we're going to love the Lord because our relationship with Christ is bigger than the problem at the church let's not skim milk it takes a real man or a woman to be mature sure so little kids that get down to start scrapping and clawing about this they they did a movie a few years back called the day after I never watched the movie but there's a principle out there the day after and you think about it this will help in the church when you get done running the pastor down and you get done running the Deacon down and those trustees and those musicians I'd run them down and pretty soon all of them just go home and you come Church isn't open lights are still off nobody leads the songs nobody plays the instruments Pastor he doesn't come out preach because you just criticized them and they all went home amen somewhere we got to build up the Bible says being built up in the Most Holy Faith Lord let me be a builder let me come together and build and Lord you sent gifts into the church to make the church stronger Lord I want to be supporting those gifts and those things of God because God uses flawed people look through the Bible he picks up flawed people and begins to use a Moses begins to use a Paul well God could never use a murderer he used Moses and he Ed Paul and a blasphemer hey Blas well Paul said I was blasphemed but I blasphemed ignorantly amen may God help us today praise the Lord I'm just going to come to a close so many things will you just give me a couple more minutes this is so the other day our sister there was a sister in our church she's from Siberia and she was telling me this and it kind of came to mind because brother preaches a message called is it right to say brother brandom sir I mean if I was in Noah's day I would be telling like Noah heard from God and he said go into the ark I lived in Moses day I'd say Moses and so many people like they want to tell you a story well well let's just give glory to God let's no no glory to I'll tell you I'm just going to say this okay there was this old man who went down to this Egypt and he got all those people and he did 10 moral notable Miracles and he came out and he and he brought them all out and that that that old man said something to the and open the Red Sea and they brought them all the way out and they got them over there and they were dancing cuz all of them were destroyed and we don't need that man the old man anymore like why are you ashamed to say Moses why why you'd still be in the denominations you still believe be believ in the eve aen Apple you know and baptizing Father Son and Holy Spirit and believing the evidence was of the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues but God sent a prophet in our generation his name was William brandham I'm not ashamed of the name William brandham because God wasn't ashamed to come up and have his picture taken with him and if God's not ashamed of him I'm not ashamed of him that's what Paul said be not ashamed of me his his messenger he preached a message called how can I overcome listen to the message it's powerful brother man makes it real simple he said you got to keep life in you you have to keep life inside of you and as a Christian you have to keep life inside of you and I was thinking about this because this sister tells us she was from Siberia and it gets really cold up there mdova and there and they'd gone to Russia I think she was born there sister Kia she was telling me the story one day she was coming home from school and she got really tired and it's so cold up there we were up there in in Saskatchewan it was - 36 degrees I don't know how people do it I tell I told I said you know the first thing I'm going to tell Eve when I see Eve I said eve whatever they tell you do it you don't know what 30ga 36 deg is you broke the rules and now it's the curse it's just so it was so cold and so now this Kia she's talking about living in in Siberia and it was so cold and she she one day she she was coming home from school and she just sat down by the road and she got tired she sat down and just rested and she was just resting she got home she told her mom said Mom I was so tired and so cold coming I just sat down by the side and her mother looked at her said don't you ever don't you ever sit down by the side of the road in that cold weather because that's the first sign of freezing to death and dying and I'm here to tell you we live in a generation where it's becoming cold amen and we see the Revival and it's getting cold don't ever ever sit down along the road somewhere and say I'm just going to rest right here and I because it's death it's the signs of death you keep going to church you keep lifting up your hands amen amen when you when you get cold when they say you start rubbing your hand am mean you create your own heat amen you start rubbing and I might have to clap my hands I might have I might even have to shout a little bit what are you doing I'm keeping life in me I refuse to get cold in lady OA hot or cold cold amen hot or cold say Lord I want to be hot for you I don't care what people think I don't care if they think I'm a fanatic I'm alive I'm alive I don't know they people I don't going to the I'm alive be my birthday I'll be 55 years that I'm alive I've been married 35 years you know ups and down like I'm married still have a desire to go to God I I made some mistakes along the way but this message works and it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I'm not ashamed of the Gospel it works amen I'm going to keep going on I'm going to keep pressing on maybe there's somebody streaming here this morning amen and you like to hear that keep pressing on don't get cold along the way somewhere pick up your Bible get down on your knees say God help me God strengthen me Lord I want to renew myself this morning things that are to be things that are to be you know I was thinking we just skip over a lot of these things back to our text he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe it also in me he said I'm going to go and prepare a place for you as we get older these words become more precious to us when you're young you're like I'm Invincible you get older Jesus told me he was going to prepare a place for me he would come and get me he would bring me unto himself is that what Jesus Christ told you as a Believer if you're not a Believer you're not subject or the recipient of those those promises but as a Believer you are go down a little road with me think about these two little babies in the womb two little twins are in the womb they're talking together like hey it's really warm in here isn't it yeah yeah you hear that Thump Thump that's our Mama's heartbeat it's so nice it's so nice we've never had a problem we're just floating around in this ambic fluid it's so I reach over and take your hand it's so wonderful it's so cozy in here I never want to leave this place it's so nice but there comes a time and they may even have discussions I don't know how babies and they play what play music to your baby and they pick it up and whatever and they maybe even have talk like is there life after the womb is life after the womb probably write books if you gave them we could write books is there life after the womb I don't want life after the womb I just want to live here but there Comes A Time usually about nine months like it or not you're going to be delivered you're coming out of the womb and you may have been comfortable in the place that you were in this is more than just a parable you're coming out and although you may fight and scream coming through it you're coming out to a new world where you can grow and Run and Jump and read and sing and talk and have a career and all these things like do you ever want to go back to the womb do you ever want to read that book is their life after no because it's a new life stay with me here as we grow older I don't know if any we're going to live to be 150 years old right the road map says is appointed unto man once to die so if you're in the womb you say I want to be here but about 9 months it comes time and in our life somewhere along there and it might be after knee Replacements or hips or whatever and the pain and the agony or whatever like yeah I think I'm ready I think I'm ready and you see the sometimes we get the and we don't know if we but there was a man that said because I live you can live also he that liveth and believeth on me shall never die there's a whole another world that's what the prophet of God he goes on he's talking about this I've got something here he's talking about uh times he said we might not be alive in 5 minutes he said we don't know when we're going this is things that are to be 19 days before he passes he said it's in God's hands he said he didn't know himself and when that time would be but it's in the hands of God only now he's telling them that after death there is life because I go and prepare a place that is to receive them shows that there he is speaking to them that there is a life after this life is ended and what a constellation that ought to be to all of us to know that after this life is over there is a life that we go into 19 days before he passes he's preaching his own funeral there is a life there is life beyond the womb with a little two twins now the prophet of God is looking to that other life 19 days ler he's walking through that door he said it's a constellation and as you get older it becomes more of a reality to you and as you begin to see the days of your life drying close then it begins to you begin to pack up a little closer getting ready for that great event it's a continuing of this same life in another world in another place so thankful for a prophet showing me the road map and furthermore I think he tells going beyond the curtain of time time he went and hugged those people you know he even had a fear himself he didn't want to die is this okay he thought he'd be a cloud his mother told him look we're just going to float on on on clouds and play Harps he said I didn't want to be a spirit he said I was afraid to die he said not that I had a fear I just didn't want to be a spirit I see brother Neville I want to talk to him he's a little Cloud floating p and that was his mother thing think he said the seals have come and revealed that to us opened it up in a revelation he said he went beyond the curtain time and he hugged those people he hugged those people and they were real they were real people people I like that over in Corinthians last scripture 2 Corinthians CH 5 is this all right it's all scripture right second Corinthians chapter 5 brother random says that our faith is not based on the shifting Sands of man's theology but it's based on the word of God as we get older some of us get some miles on us we want to know our faith is based in the word of God not in cliches not in men but it's based in the word of God and the road map says in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens and in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven amen do you have that desire today say Lord there's something groaning inside of me Lord there has to be a new body there's a deep calling to the Deep Lord there has to be a place where there's no more aches there's no more pains there's no more suffering I believe in the Book of Revelation the Bible says he came and he wiped the tears from their eyes and there was no more pain there was no more sorrow there was no more fear it was all passed away former things have passed away and all things have become new it's in the road map when you take the road map and you have you know people write books life after death well Jesus Christ was one that went beyond and he came back and he tells us what happens there this is the book this is the one you need to read and let your faith rest in the word of God the Bible says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I already have one waiting I just step over into that new body oh blessed be the name of the Lord things that are to be I don't know why the Lord put this on my heart this message we're going through things as individuals we're going through things as a church maybe you're getting a little older in life things that are to be and when I get to that gate I don't want to back up in fear I want to be wrapped in the Robes of his righteousness not in my own righteousness but I want to know for sure Paul told it was a Peter there work out your own salvation I know it wasn't God when I sat on that Pew that gave me that I know it was God that gave me that desire to walk to that Altar and give my heart to Christ it was Christ that changed me old things passed away and All Things become new what is it Romans chapter 8 if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your moral mortal body do you believe that today say Lord Quicken me things that are to be I tell you one we're going to close right on this Mark 16 these are things that ought to be Jesus said in my name they'll cast out Devils those are things that will be Christians that believe in Christ they'll Cast Away evil spirits that try to influence their life you you feel them every day I do every I war with the evil spirits they're all around us he said in my name you'll cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues they take up any serpent it shall not harm them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover those are things that will happen the Believers they'll lay hands and they do you believe that you believe it if you're a Believer it's the Bible I was just thinking about that there was a sister in our church she had three heart attacks three separate ones and she was in the hospital and uh and she died three times and she they died and they were able to revive her and she pass passed again and they were able to revive her and bring her back with CPR the shock however it was and the third time she passed and they were able to bring her back but there was 18 minutes as she was as she was gone with no heartbeat and so they brought her back but they had to do medically and induced the coma because they had to put a breathing tube down her um her throat and so she could breathe and because her natural body would fight it so they had her in a a medically induced aoma so she's there she couldn't move or anything there was no response and so it was at some time I don't remember if it was a couple days or whatever it was and the doctors became very concerned because if you're 18 days without 18 minutes without oxygen it causes brain damage so they said you know what we need to weer off the medication so that we can see the extent of the brain damage but there's a sister at a church that was helping her she said she called me she was so concerned she said you don't understand when people go into this and they take them all the medicine your eyes the dilation maybe we have nurses here that your eyes should dilate when you put a light in it should dilate even if you have no expression of your other um SE taste feel SM here your eyes should die and we have none of that she said it's the it has to be extensive but we begin to pray because God answers prayer he's the same yesterday today and forever they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover ask and it shall be anoint with oil and pray the prayer of faith and the Lord shall raise them up and the church began to pray and her husband is a prayer Warrior and and we just began to pray and and God did a miracle it was a miracle and slowly she started coming out of this aoma and every day she would get better and better and then she could move and I was in there she could just squeeze your hand and then she could hear and she could move and and slowly she began to come back and come back and we began to pray for her then they took her out and they moved her to a rehab and began to take her and then she just got better and better and they took her home the other day and pastor called her said hey how's she doing she she screamed from the background I'm doing wonderful Goden because God brings people back from the dead and he sustains their life why because these signs shall follow them that believe amen they shall cast out Devils evil spirits that's the god that we serve these things amen things that are to be that's are things that should happen to Believers how many Believers we have in the house today say I'm a Believer Lord Jesus amen let's just bow our heads of the musicians will come praise be to God Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads I've spoke Lord a Time Lord as brother chatt had directed Lord and having a little longer service but Lord you love us today Lord and you're you're dealing in so many different facets of our life father and your children are here and each one going through different things in our life and we raised our hands that we were needy and I pray God that the Holy Spirit would just be close to us right now father Lord you would speak to us Lord in a way that only you can speak Lord you spoke to me as a young man when I was back in my Pew Lord and I got up and went up front and knelt down and Lord Jesus I dedicated and gave my life to you and you changed my life Lord I want to thank you for that and now my brothers and sisters Lord going through things in each one of our Lives father we're going through life life is not a fairy tale land or Wonderland it's life father there's many are the afflictions of the righteous but you promis to deliver us out of them all father Lord It's appointed unto man once to die Lord there's a Time an appointment just as a little children in the womb Lord there's a time that we come Lord to exit this world and to this
