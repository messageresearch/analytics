communion service that sunday on on january 2nd and also because of the friday night service we're going to cancel the wednesday before that so wednesday december 29th we won't have service we'll be having the watch night service on friday and then the regular service on sunday so god bless you no more announcements i think revelation chapter 3 verse 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also am overcome and set down with my father and his throne amen you can have your seats may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word and bless us tonight we pray so i want to take for a subject as a title the contrast in queens the contrast in queens and it's going to be kind of a continuation of what we were looking at on sunday because on sunday we were looking down through the bible and you can see that we talked about the mystery in plain view and when we come to the end time the prophet of god comes and and through his ministry the lord takes the seals off and unseals the bible for us so that we can look back down through and we can see that the bible's been christ amen it's been the revelation of jesus christ which christ is the mystery of god revealed but through that revelation of christ down through there there's been a revealing of male and female all the way down through and so we want to look into the scripture again and take the subject the contrast in queens because we know that christ is a king but that king will have a queen and in the message modern events are made clear by prophecy brother venom says rebecca didn't wait to get the second order they asked her said will you go let her say let her say she said i'll go she was firmly inspired of god she became one of the queens of the bible for acting upon the pulsation of the spirit of god that moved upon her to receive what was absolutely the truth and she believed it so brother branham calls her one of the queens of the bible so when i start talking about the contrast in queens i'm not talking about and maybe just necessarily queen sitting on the throne but these characters in the bible these ladies in the bible that brother ben calls a queen he calls sarah a queen of the bible he calls rebecca a queen but we know there was the bible is so good at at it's it's so perfect in displaying the very mind of god but it's so hidden in the stories and hidden in the details but when the seals come off you look back down through and you see the very nature and very plan of god because when you look down through the bible you see these queens of the old testament that were coming through in sarah and in rebecca and and all these ones that were coming through all the way up to literal queens amen in the kingdom of david but you'll also see evil queens as well and you see a contrast between the two natures and when you look at these queens in the old testament amen you're looking at the false and the true vine the false woman and the true woman the false church and the true church and it's coming all the way down through from genesis all the way through the bible amen this is not a new testament concept or just an end time concept this has been playing itself out all the way through the bible god has been showing and revealing amen the path the two vines the the two types of women amen the king he's been showing all of this all through the bible and now when the seals are taken off our bible is constantly becoming a new book so let's turn to esther this is an obvious one where we can easily get the contrast we know this really well but i just want to spend a few minutes in esther and then move on esther chapter one verse 9 esther chapter 1 verse 9 also vasti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belongeth the king ahyseras so we know the king is now having a feast to show off his splendor and the greatness of his kingdom he's invited everybody to this feast and vashti now is having a feast for the women and so now she's she's separated out the women to herself and vashti is very much a type of the catholic church and now she's got a feast of the women which is the ecumenical move the the catholic church with all the other churches over here together and so she has her own thing going and then in chapter 10 it says on the seventh day seventh day seventh age on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded the all these guys with these names i don't know if i can pronounce them all but there's seven of them so on the seventh day we have seven princes amen we have seven men uh the chamberlain's which are typing the seven church age messengers and these seven chamberlains that served in the presence of azaris the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlain's therefore was the king very roth and his anger burned in him amen so now we find out in the seventh day of this great feast amen vashti and vashti means beautiful the name the meaning of her name is beautiful so this beautiful queen and the feast of women amen is doing her own thing while the king is having his his feast and after seven days he sends the seven chamberlains or the seven angels after to gather the woman unto himself into this great feast and she refuses to come because here in the seventh day in the seventh age god amen has sent a message of all seven church ages all the revelation wrapped up in one and he brought that message to all the church and they refused it they refused to come amen and so she she refused the commandment of the king she refused the word of the seven chamberlains amen to come and she stayed with her feast of women so she was refused brother branham says in the message god hiding himself in simplicity now i think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of god to be so grateful to god this will just not only be a beautiful building he's talking about the dedication of the of the tabernacle after the expansion and remodel this will just not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of jesus christ in every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place to our lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people i trust it'll always be a house of god of beauty so here vashti's name was beautiful she had a beautiful exterior amen but she had an ugly interior because she was beautiful to look upon her name means beautiful she was told that she was fair he wanted her to come for all to see because she was fair to look upon amen but but she didn't have the beautiful character of christ amen so she refused the king but brother branham was saying what we want is the beautiful characteristic of jesus christ and every person that comes in in the message the marriage of the lamb he says esther purged her heart before god walked up with a meek and humble spirit the church that's going to be the bride of christ now remember so brother branham is now typing esther with the bride of christ and he says esther walked up with a meek and humble spirit she had a completely different nature than what vashtihan now remember esther refused the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king and the women today the church that thinks she's going to get in because she's got more numbers she's the best dressed crowd she's got the biggest organization the biggest church in the city and things like that you'll miss it a million miles if you're depending on that it's a sweet kind reverent spirit to the word of god washed by the water of the word and the word in you it's a washing so brother brahms typing esther's nature amen with that of the bride of christ and esther come with meekness and sweetness amen before the king and she didn't take any of the worldly adornment according to the prophet of god and we know we've been through this many times so we're just going to hit these points and move but but we know that she was under the care of haggai the keeper of the women the chamberlain to prepare them for their for their meeting with the king and in that preparation she went through a purification and and she was she was washed she was clean she was purified under the ministry of haggai and the ministry of haggai very much types the ministry of brother phantom in our day and under that ministry she was purified amen she was washed she was clean she was purified then she received the ointments and and the haggai appointed unto her certain things that she needed amen when she went before the king amen and that says in esther that when the women when it was their turn to come to the king amen they could take anything that they desired amen it's it and we've talked about this many times don't know this is new but we live in we live in a laodicean world in a laodicean condition amen and we've got everything we desire at our fingertips and we can bring any of it into our worship that we want to god we're not in the age where i mean we travel by horseback or foot and we come to church and we we have a limited exposure to limited things and no no opportunity to expose ourselves we can be exposed to anything we want to be exposed to at any time and we can take part in any pleasure that we desire to take part in amen and we can bring that in to our worship bring it into our lives if we want to but it says of esther esther when it was her turn she only took what haggai required amen what he had appointed and nothing more amen so she went to the king amen fully prepared by haggai not with her own mind her own thinking or anything of the world or the influence of any of the other virgins she didn't take the influence you know obviously some probably got to go before her and some were planning to go after her and she would see what they would take and then they would choose this adornment and this perfume and this and whatever they they chose amen but she didn't let any of that influence her she was only influenced by the ministry of haggai and it was showing listen when we look at esther we look at how she submitted to the ministry of haggai amen and she only took what he required and he had appointed it shows that she has the very character of humility and submission the king had vashti who was beautiful and fair to look upon but she was self-willed and so because of her self-will amen she was refused and she was rejected amen but now esther is going to be brought on the scene and esther is brought in and accepted and esther's acceptance amen is based on how she presented herself to the king and she presented herself solely based on the influence of hackie eye so it was showing listen it was showing and depicting her character when she come to the king she had the character of gentleness meekness and submission the king didn't want just another beautiful woman that didn't work we come to the end time god doesn't want just another nice church another good system another beautiful organization that hasn't worked god wants character amen he's looking for character that will reflect his own nature he's looking for somebody amen that'll stay submissive to the ministry of haggai in our day and surrender their own thinking and when everybody else thinks amen and just listen to what haggai is saying and present themselves to the king the way haggai says you ought to be presented to the king amen so let's turn to esther chapter seven we're not going to go deep into this i just want to hit a couple points and then move on esther chapter 7 and we all know the story we're very very familiar with the story of how how esther his life is now in jeopardy and all the lives of the jews is in jeopardy because of because of haman and his scheme and the deception that he's brought and now it is it is up to her amen to try to bring salvation to her people amen and now she is the queen she has been chosen and then she's taken vashti's place amen but she she's taken vashti's place but she's never taken vashti's attitude she takes vashti's place but she never mimics vashti's character she always stays meek and submissive and humble remember when it was time for her to go in first to the king amen she hadn't been summoned she hadn't been called amen and she was going to go try to talk to the king and she was going to invite him to the banquet of wine because she wants to talk to him about this need that she has amen and look how she presents herself and then she asks mordecai and all the people outside to pray and fast with her she will pray and fast amen all of her mains will pray and fast then she'll put on all the royal garment that was appointed by the king and put on all the royal garment and then she will enter in and when she enters in she comes in neatly she comes in submissive she comes in humbly she doesn't put on the royal garment comes stomping in and say you know what's going on and you know what what haman's doing and you know this and you know that but look at esther's approach to the king she approaches the king submissively she approaches the king humbly she honors and reverences the king and because of her approach to the king the king receives esther's advance and and puts forth the scepter and she comes and touches the scepter she's received and when she comes she doesn't just start start staking her needs and making demands and you must do this and you must do that so when she comes to the king and the king accept her he says what is it you want and she says i want you to come to my place and i want to entertain you i want to treat you amen i want to entertain you amen and there's such an approach and esther there's such a something that we can learn amen that we we approach god and i think sometimes uh to me this is just me this is just brother chan i think sometimes we talk about god into god in too familiar away like he's a buddy and forget that he's the creator of all heavens and earth and almost make demands like like he's our genie in a bottle god fix this for me and fix that for me and fix it of course he wants us to come and of course he wants us amen to to cry out to him in need and pray to him but i i what if we can mimic esther's approach and come with humility and reverence and understand who it is we're speaking to at all times amen that's why i say so many of these new songs that that you hear sung in in christian circles there's so much like a boyfriend girlfriend love song and it's putting me in christ on equal levels and and he's my boyfriend and my best bud and him and i are chumming around and maybe they don't use those words but that's the attitude of the song and i don't like that i think worship should always be up amen it should always be directed to one that's higher than i now there's always should be a bowing before the greater one than i and humility and a reverence and our worship should always be directed up not lateral but higher and some of these you know this ultra familiarity hey it to me it just doesn't set well amen i think we should worship a god a mighty god a savior amen and our worship should be in humility and reverence and respect for this god so esther really shows us amen the approach and shows us the right character in in esther chapter 7 verse 1 so so the king and haman came to to banquet with esther the queen and the queen said again and to esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to half of the kingdom now look at what this woman has the opportunity to ask for he said what's your petition what's your request i'll give you everything up to half the kingdom now esther does not have a greedy nature she's not coming to him to get a bunch of things or half the kingdom she comes because she wants life verse 3 then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favor in thy sido king and if it pleased the king let my life be given me at my petition in my people at my request for you were sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bond men and bond women i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage then king azaris answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman then haman was afraid before the king and the queen so esther i just wanna if i can use this to start to paint a picture esther is coming in reverence and submission and humility to the king and she's making her request i want my life and she's saying if we had even been sold just into slavery as bond women and bomb i wouldn't have even said anything although you know whoever did it would have you to deal with that's what she's saying but i'm just saying it because it's serious and we need your help and and he says who is this and she says it's this wicked haman and i i like to see that i use this terminology and use this as an example because esther is not weak esther is strong esther is bold esther is able to conquer her fears esther is able to move when others can't move amen esther was the one who went into the king unbidden because it was needful and she saw the need esther is brave esther is bold esther is strong when you read the story you find this is not meek is not weak humble amen is not weakness amen it's a display of respect and honor and understanding of who you are and who you're in the presence with because when the when when as arias ask her amen who is this she says there's this wicked haman she wasn't afraid of haman she was bold enough to call him out amen but when she spoke to the king she was respectful and gave honor to the king so this esther is not weak vashti was not strong and esther weak but rather reversed vashti was weak and esther was strong i hope we'll see that as we go on so let's jump over to first kings and we're going to spend some time in a little bit of a bible study keep your bibles handy we'll flip to a few scriptures here because i want to see some things together first kings 16. first kings 16 and 29 and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him and it came and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk on the sins of jeroboam the son of nebot that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbale king of the zedonians and went and served baal and worshiped him and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria and they have made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him we're going to start speaking about jezebel now as one of these queens in the bible and and we all know she's not our good example of a queen like esther was but she's been used throughout the bible as a as a as a something that's atrocious or loathsome in a woman amen and so she's the wrong type of woman she's the wrong type of queen but but i just want to brother frank if you could pull up the white board for me i just want to take a look at a few scriptures and i want to show where jezebel comes from amen and this is a little bit of a rabbit trail but if you'll let me take just a short rabbit trail i think it'll help us amen because aham the the lord became so angry with ahab uh because of ahab he says as if it was a light thing that he walked in the sins of of jeroboam what jeroboam did was set up the two golden calves amen to keep the 10 tribes of israel from going back into jerusalem and worshipping at the temple so he set up the two golden calves one and dan and one in ephraim and set up an idolatry and a false worship to keep the ten tribes to himself to keep them from returning back to jerusalem so they wouldn't go back amen to the house of david and so he said that ahab was continuing this and it says as if it was a light thing and it came to pass verse 31 as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of neba that he took to wife jezebel so now this he's first offended that he stays in this in this idolatry but on top of that worse than that as if this was a light thing he took jezebel to be a wife and god was so angry with this and then he begins to worship baal and brother banh tells us ahab was not that bad of a guy but it was the influence of his wife that corrupted him and moved him amen into the worship of baal so i want to take a minute and look at and look at this so we have ahab ahab and jezebel now jezebel comes from ethbale oh not right jezebel comes from i'll just write it over here fbale right do i got that right is that his name let me see it yeah ethbale king of the zedonians so he is the king of the zidonians so the zedonians are from zidane or sidon it's both ways in the bible it's the same city it's a city-state and he's the king of that and ahab is is now marrying jezebel this is very much a political alliance amen so he's marrying a princess her father is the king of the zidonians the zidonians are just north amen of the of the land of of ahab and omri uh ahab's dad started to make alliances with these people and as he was starting making alliances and agreements and treat treaties with them now ahab becomes king and he goes up and takes the the king of the zidonian's uh daughter and brings her down and marries her and she she is a phoenician and they are caught in baal worship and he comes and he joins together with her for political gain amen and this becomes a corruption that sets in so jezebel came from zidane or sidon let's turn to joshua if you with me joshua 19. and let's find out where all this comes from joshua 19 and 24. joshua is now dividing up by lot to the children of israel their portion of the land that they're to go and conquer amen and they will become their inheritance their land and in verse 24 says and the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of asher according to their families and their border was hellcath and haley and bitten and akshath and alamelek and reaches to carmel westward in the shoreline and turn it toward this uh sun rising and beth dagon and reaches zebulun into the valley of jephthah l toward the north side of bethemek and neil and goethe out to kabul and on to the left hand and hebron and rehab and haman and cana even unto great zidane okay so asher is supposed to take possession of zidane that's their lot that's their portion and then the coast turneth to rhema and to the strong city of tyre and the coast turneth to hesa and the outgoings thereof are from the sea from the coast to akzib uma also in apec and rehab 20 and two cities with their villages this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of asher according to their families these cities with their villages so when they first come into the land under the promise that they're given moses brings them in exodus and then moses is taken away now joshua is taking them into the land amen and in the land they're dividing up the land to the tribes and the tribes are supposed to go in by the commandment of god and they're supposed to drive out the inhabitants and take possession of the land and asher's job is to take this lot this portion on the northern end of israel and drive out the habitants and take possession of the land amen let's go to judges chapter 1. verse 31 and judges 131 neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of octjo nor the inhabitants nor the inhabitants of zidane nor of elab nor of exhib nor of helba nor of afic nor of rehab but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out see one generation's compromise and fail to keep the word always leads to something bad and the bible includes all of these things so we can go back and look at this and realize asher could not drive out on the inhabitants so what asher did is begin to put the canaanites under tribute and then they begin to dwell with the canaanites now they had the canaanites subdued they had the canaanites amen they were under pressure they were under tribute they were subdued but they were not driven out amen and if asher had done what god told asher to do there would be no king of the zedonians there would be no jezebel there would be no wicked evil witch of a queen in in israel so you can see how partial obedience compromise and disobedience is the thing that's been the affliction all through the bible it starts all the way back in the garden of eden and it continues all the way through and god has written it so clear and left it there so that we can always go back and recognize amen brother benham said one word one word caused the ruin and a fall of all of humanity and the ruination of the earth one word how will we get back doubting one word amen this is the age where we come back to the full revelation of the full truth of god and there must be a people on the earth that will say not again amen not this time but if god will help me i'll give my whole self to this word because compromise partial obedience amen is always been the ruination so if asher had done what they were commissioned to do there would be no jezebel now where did sidon come from let's go to genesis chapter 10. let's see why this is so still so terrible genesis chapter 10 verse 6. we're talking after the flood the genealogies of noah we came to 10 6 and the sons of ham cush and mizrahim and foot and canaan and out of canaan comes all the canaanites all right so let's go down to verse 15. and caden begot sidon sidon that's where zidan sidon the zedonians come from they come from the accursed canaan because canaan was cursed by noah so the the curse was on canaan one of caden's children his side and sidon is the the the the son of canaan the inhabitants of zion become the zidonians amen so jezebel comes from the accursed canaan everything is linked friends that's why there's got to be a people that can be washed by the word in this day and stay under that word to wash all of this stuff away because man has proved he cannot do it so now that curse on canaan comes down to side and sidon and zidane are the same thing become the zidonians now there's a king there when asher comes in he's supposed to drive them all out and get that cursed nation those cursed people out of god's land and they failed to do it and when they failed to do it he said they'll become a prick in thy eyes and a thorn in thy flesh and that's exactly what happens when jezebel comes and unites with ahab amen now let's look at jezebel in first kings chapter 21. now first kings 21 and 1. first kings 21-1 let's just look at the character and nature of jezebel and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria and they have spoken to nabath saying give me thy thy vineyard that i make have it for a garden of herbs because it is near into my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seemed good to thee i will give it the the worth of it and money and nabath said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee what is naboth doing is naboth greedy is navastinji no naboth is sticking with the word because the word was this is the inheritance for the you and for your children hereafter he was staying in the line of the word because he was staying in the inheritance of his father here somebody wanted him to sell out for gain for better vineyard or for more money wants him to leave the word the portion of the word for his day his allotted portion and go something for something better or for money but here he is wanting to stay with the word the inheritance of my father amen and so naboth is a righteous man in verse four and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite has spoke to him for had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my father's and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eat us no bread and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and he said unto me to him and i said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered and will not give i will not give thee my vineyard and jezebel's wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of nabath the jezreelite so she wrote letters in ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters into the elders into the nobles that were in his in a city dwelling with naboth and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set nabath on high among the people and set two men sons of below before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die and the men of the city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants of the city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them they proclaimed the fast and set neboth on high among the people and there came in two men of children of belial and sat before him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth and the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard and naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead this has been jezebel's tactic ever since and the jezebel religion has done the same thing spiritually to anyone who wanted to stay with the word see we're looking at a contrast in characters jezebel is self-willed jezebel is conniving manipulating politically motivated this is not the nature we know she's not got the right nature anybody in the world knows jezebel's not the right nature but she she's displaying the nature of the false church amen amen and god has other women like esther displaying the nature of the true church and bride of jesus christ and when we look at these things it's more than just stories because we want to look at that and say if i ever start to need to manipulate a situation i'm already moving the wrong way if i have to become dishonest amen to push an agenda forward if i have to become politically motivated in the church amen instantly when i begin to do those things i'm now i'm now replicating the false vine and the false woman amen because all i need to do is humble myself under the word and approach my god with humility and sincerity and reverence to him and tell him my need and let him decide what needs to be done not go and tell him you need to do this and you need to do this and you need to do that esther never come and said do this do this do that she said i'm just asking for my life it was up the king and we know later as she progressed amen through there the king would say now what do you want esther never said i want this i want this i want this she never says doing and shush on the palace today as we did yesterday and hang the ten sons of haman she didn't do that of her own accord amen when the king looked at her and gave the report and says now what more would you want and she answered esther is always under headship esther is always submissive to the king the king she will not just demand but the king will ask and then she'll tell but jezebel's not under any headships she's taking headship she's taking dominion she's become dominating esther's never becoming dominating but esther is not weak you can see esther is not passive amen because when he says what do you want done do today like we did yesterday and hang the tents on she's not weak she's not passive amen she knows what needs to be done amen and she knows amen where the evil is and how to correct it but she's not making demands and she's not making it happen see you can say these are stories in the bible but it comes down to our personal lives amen when we're trying to get something done in a workplace in a church environment and a family and we have to become manipulative and deceiving and political amen you're emulating the wrong character that's the nature of lucifer that has come down through canaan amen that has come down to jezebel but when we can go to god with reverence and humility and sincerity and say lord i know you're god and you construct all things and you ordain all things and i'm happy but lord there's a need that i have here there's a conflict there's a something going on i'm asking you lord just to help me i'm asking you to take care of it and then let god work it out amen let god do the thing you can see the two different natures and in christ amen this is the time of of of of the nature of christ being displayed in his blind bride she is becoming the actual reflection of the character of christ on this earth so it matters how she reflects that character in every conversation and every day of her life praise be to god brother benham says in the church age book on the th and the thyatiran church age he said it is most worthy of note that the very name thyatira means dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that ruthlessly invades all conquers all and despotically controls now a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world so the prophet said why he's going all the way back in the bible brother bran is not just making a statement based off his opinion he's looking all the way back to characters like jezebel like vashti like like all the others amen it's a curse that dominating female spirit is a curse let's go to to revelation chapter three or maybe two let me look and see yeah i think it's revelation chapter 2. yeah revelation chapter 2 verse 18 and unto the angel of the church and thyatira write these things saith the son of god who hath his eye like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass i know thy works and thy charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and at last to be more than the first notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffers that woman jezebel brother ben says the name thyatira means dominating female and under the under the the the the speech he gives to the thyatiran church age he says you suffered that woman jezebel which call of herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed in the idols so brother brahms he goes so clear and tells us this is the rise of the catholic church this is the wrong church coming into play in this age and he says verse 21 and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works so he's going to cast her and her children to death to a bed of tribulation and to death so hold on to that and we'll get back to that statement further on in the thiatian church age he says in this thiatar and church age she is she is a dominating female she is mystery babylon she is the great she is jezebel the false prophetess why because the true female is submissive to god christ is her head she has no word but his no thought but his no leadership but his but what about this church she has cast out the word destroyed the bibles and worthy essays of the godly she has slain those who would preach the truth she has taken over kings princes and nations controls armies and insists that she is the true body of christ and that her popes are the vicars of christ she is entirely seduced by the devil until she in turn has become the seducer of others she is the bride of satan and has produced his bastard child religions so satan has a bride and christ has a bride and these two are in contrast one to another and i don't ever want to be found emulating satan's bride but always emulating christ's bride let's go to revelation 17. revelation 17 and verse 1. and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will show unto thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of the abominations and filthiness of her fornication and a pointer forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus when i saw her i wandered with great admiration amen we see that this is a beautiful woman like vashti beautiful but evil beautiful but self-willed beautiful but not having the character of christ and we know that she amen she is mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth so she is a and she's the mother of harlots because that system has brought harlot systems out amen let's go over to chapter 18 verse 4 and read just one more passage here and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached them to heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities remember her even as the rewarded you and double under her double according to her works and the cup which she hath filled to fill to her doubled how much she had glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord who judgeth her so this woman calls herself a queen she believes she's the queen of heaven amen so we have a queen but there's going to be a queen of heaven there's going to be one that sits with him in his throne as he has overcome and sit with his father in his throne there will be a queen she claims to be the queen but her character and nature prove she's not the queen but there will be a queen so there's going to be an image of two queens one exalts herself one comes humbly submissively reverently and becomes exalted amen esther never exalted herself esther came low to the king the king exalted esther the king gave put esther in vashti's place but then after haman was brought down the king gave haman's house unto esther exalting her again the vashti exalted herself amen jezebel exalted herself amen this great has exalted herself lucifer exalted himself but christ comes meek and lowly so when christ comes amen he's a tender plant out of dry ground amen there's no commonness that we should desire he's smitten and afflicted and rejected he comes humble his voice won't even be heard in the city he won't even quench a smoking flax he comes quiet and humble and submissive to the will of god amen not weak there's no weakness in him but there's submissive humility in him right lucifer amen wants to be strong he exalts himself amen he's self-willed he's self-exalting amen he's all of these things that christ is not amen he exalts himself and he will be ultimately a base jezebel exalted herself she was a base the dogs licked her blood and ate her and she became dung upon the field but esther came humbly and she was exalted christ comes to earth through humble submission and he is exalted so we have to have the nature of christ not the nature of lucifer so these women in the bible are showing which queen they are and which bride they are amen and the churches in the world today are showing what queen they are and what bride there are brother bam says in christ the mystery of god revealed he said what's the denomination trying to do exalt itself like lucifer they so call themselves the church the bride which they are in revelation 17 as it spoke of the false bride above christ's little flock the bride lucifer thinks and exalts himself above the humble word of god's truth by the knowledge of the revelation and has placed himself by a seminary education and theology and that they have got themselves they've got themselves up so darwin is exalting themselves the other one's constantly coming in humility and submission to the word but lucifer looks strong and acted strong but he was weak christ came looking weak but he was strong amen he had strength that they could not detect he had power that was not noticed amen because his power was masked in humility and surrender amen and esther had the same thing she had a strength vastly didn't have christ as a strength lucifer doesn't have so humility and submission is not weakness and furthermore i think lack of humility and submission is weakness because when when we must begin to dominate a situation and control it amen it shows that that we have no trust or faith that things will work out on their own we're trying to manipulate or control an outcome and that shows an inner weakness amen but christ never had to manipulate or control anything he knew god was taking control of everything esther never needed to manipulate a situation all she had to do and it was getting to the king's presence and with the right atmosphere she just told the king what was wrong and the king took care of the rest amen but jezebel had no confidence anything would work out unless she made it work out lucifer took it in his own hands amen jezebel took it in her own hands amen the church has taken it in their own hands they've used politics they've used armies they used everything to control amen because they had no real trust they had no strength of virtue no real virtue it looked like they were strong but they were weak but the humble little bride and the humble christ were the ones with the real strength because they didn't have to protect themselves they had a protector they didn't have to defend themselves they had a defender they didn't have to dominate because they knew the one who created and controlled everything there was no need for domination manipulation control or politics amen many of you who've worked in the workplace for quite a while you've seen people who manipulate and and then back by and use political schemes and try to get ahead amen and sometimes that may have even been targeted to you at times and they may have tried to get a promotion over you or work something out and but if you'll just hold steady and not react to any of that amen and just hold steady and prove that you trust god and you trust god placed you there and every promotion is given by god not by this company my position my place my income amen everything comes from god this guy amen it can do no more to me if i'm in god's place in god's will what he can do to me so you you know when when when one person starts manipulating and politicking and and doing spreading lies and and gathering sons of belial to bring false witness when you come over here and you try to find your own witnesses and and you tried to and then talk to people and and get things lined up and and get things squared away and get people on your side amen you're showing that you've got the same nature that that man over there has you may not be lying but you're showing a lack of strength and a lack of confidence in almighty god i say if god orders our steps we don't have to be afraid if god orders the the road we take and god knows the way that i take and the fosters of the righteous are ordered of the lord then i can say god i am in your hands amen and whatever you see fit is fine with me but i know you see my situation and i need your help and you watch oh i've seen it so many times myself i mean i've seen where i've reacted wrong in the wrong way and made a huge mess out of everything but i've also seen where i just held steady and trusted god and god will bring this house of hearts down amen it'll collapse it'll fall it'll go into ruin amen and all of a sudden you find yourself on top and you didn't mean to be on top you find yourself exalted amen man you didn't mean to you didn't ask for it you didn't want to be but it was god who done it because you you caught his nature and emulated his nature in the situation and god will take that and raise that up because that's what he once displayed is his nature amen this bible is not for sunday this bible's for every day amen let's go to second chronicles 21. i want to look at another queen and unfortunately we have to look at another evil one let's go to i want to go to second kings 11. ii kings chapter 11. i want to look at this woman athaliah when afterlife chapter 11 verse 1 when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal so the king is asai the king of judah his mother is is athaliah when athaliah saw that her son was dead she killed all the royal seeds her own grandchildren she killed all the royal seed but jehoshaba the daughter of of king jerome sister of azia took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in the bed chamber from athaliah so that he was not slain and he was with her in the house of the lord six years and athaliah did reign over the land and in the seventh year jehoiada sit and fetch the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guards and brought them to him and to the house of the lord johad is the high priest brought them to the house of the lord and made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of the lord and showed them the king's son so there's a story going on here where athaliah amen is mother to uh uh ahaziah and ahaziah is killed and then she kills all the royal seeds so there can be no successor and she absurds the throne and she takes control and she becomes queen as soul uh the soul queen no king over all of israel for six years amen so this this woman this false church is dominating for six church ages but in the seventh year amen the priest is going to show everybody no there's still a seed amen there's still a remnant that's come through there's still one here and when joash was seven years old amen in the house of the lord he presented joash as the king's son and joash was now one that could take the throne and this brings the demise of athaliah amen she's killed and and she's she's cast out and she's she's killed and joash becomes king so you see here another woman another evil queen and she does the same thing these evil queens do she takes it upon herself to give herself a position she exalts herself she was already the mother of the queen she would have been the grandmother of the next king she had a position but that position wasn't enough because lucifer had a great position but that position wasn't enough [Applause] you see amen whenever your position is not enough amen that's a problem so his problem his position wasn't enough she had to get just a little more power a little more authority being the mother of the king was all right but now that she lost that being the grandmother of the king that was not good enough so she kills her own grandchildren amen she kills all the royal seed so that she alone has all the power and all the authority this is the very tactics of lucifer and now she reigns amen and she's in control she's dominating she has a dominating female spirit she's running everything amen but there was a remnant that survived a seed that was coming down through and when he got to the seventh church age now it was time to show there is a son amen there is a king now there's a king in place amen he's been all along but now he's going to come to power and when he comes in the seventh year and then it brings her destruction and her demise beautiful now the question is where did athaliah come from let's go back to second chronicles i guess the second chronicles we're going to bounce between second chronicles and second kings second chronicles 21 second chronicles 21 and verse 1. now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david in jehovah his son reigned in a stead and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah jahil and zachariah and azariah and mikhail and sephitia all of these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel and their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom gave heed to jeham jehoram because he was the firstborn now when jehoram was risen up to to the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and diverse also of the princes of israel jerome was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife ahab's daughter became his wife who's ahab's daughter athaliah the same woman who killed all her own grandchildren and become king of judah she was the daughter of ahab and jezebel this mistake that was made all the way back when asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of zidane is still wreaking havoc and now you have jezebel as a type of the great false church but jezebel's going to have a daughter and that daughter is going to move down from that first false system of israel and move down into judah and to the house of david and she's going to slip in through marriage to the house of david and bring the same corruption her mother brought to the 10 tribes she's bringing now to the house of david god has wrote the church ages all the way back in second kings in second chronicles because that's exactly what happened jezebel had daughters and those daughters amen brought that false system and mingled it right down in with the true seed and brought it into protestantism and corrupted the whole thing because you had the ten tribes that separated from the house of david which was judah and benjamin amen and there were still righteous kings in the house of david and they still had jerusalem they still had true worship but that false system started to creep in and there's 10 nations because they made those golden calves to keep the people separated and in that system is when ahab goes and grabs jezebel out of the king of the zidonians and brings her down and she brings baal worship amen all the way down because they were already open into idolatry and begins to mingle this in but they have a daughter and that daughter amen becomes the wife amen of one of the king's sons in israel and that that daughter is athalil and she takes the same nature of her mother who took the same nature of kanan who took the same nature of lucifer and now when she saw an opportunity for power she wasn't content in the position she had she slew them all so that she could exalt herself this is always matching the false line so he had dog the daughter of ahab the wife and he wrought that which was evil in the sight of god now let's keep your place here in second chronicles and let's turn back to second kings verse eight second kings eight and sixteen and then the fifth year of jerome the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of josh jehoshaphat king of judah began to reign thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the lord there it is again go back to second chronicles 22 verse 1. and the inhabitants of jerusalem made a heziah his youngest son this is jehoram's who we were just talking about this is his son may jerome may i'm sorry and the inhabitants of jerusalem made a zio his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all of the eldest so aaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned forty and two years old was zeziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem his mother's name also was athaliah the daughter of omri and he walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab for they were in his they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction i want to tie this together because it gets a little complicated when you go through the geologies and go back and forth and there's a reason it's complicated when when ahab was on the scene he had a friend my pen is not working oh there it is he had a friend and that friend was jehoshaphat right jehoshaphat was king of judah and jehoshaphat was a righteous man they still had the true worship they still had uh uh jerusalem amen they still had the altar they still had everything ahab and jehoshaphat jehoshaphat made peace with ahab and became a friend to ahab and this sounds like a good thing because they're all israel and the ten tribes separated and jehoshaphat and let's just all come together and be brothers this is the start of the ecumenical movement and this is why the ecumenical movement is so dangerous amen because jehoshaphat remained righteous all of his life but jehoshaphat kept getting into trouble because he was a friend of ahab amen and they remember when they went up they were going to go against the syrians and they said have any prophets here and he said i got 400 and they brought the prophets up and they said go on up but he says have you got one more that's when mekiah comes on the scene because jehoshaphat knew something wasn't right with that and he asked for another prophet and that prophet come and prophesied the truth but ahab didn't like it and had him locked up amen and that was ahab's death so jehoshaphat's always getting in trouble with this ahab remember when they went down to fight against i think it was edom i don't remember now no they went to fight somebody the king of edom was with them but they went to go implore of elisha what they should do and elisha said i wouldn't even speak to you to a if it wasn't for the presence of jehoshaphat so this was not an alliance that god was pleased with it looked good like ecumenicism looks good it's good mentally but it's not good because ahab was already steeped in adultery and false worship and already aligned himself with jezebel so look at this ahab and jezebel have a son that son's name is jehoram guess what jehoshaphat and his wife have a son oh no i don't know how to get rid of that jehoram okay oh yeah i do know how to get rid of that go down here nope it doesn't work anyways so you can see this friendship and this ecumenicism is already bringing in influence one has a son named jehoram the other has a son named jehovah remember jehoshaphat kept going up to visit ahab is that right so they were visiting they become friends they become to make peace amen and now ahab and jezebel have a jehovah jehoshaphat has a jehovah room and when it comes time for jehoram to get married where does he get a wife from here and he gets athaliah to be his wife and now that corrupt thing from canaan comes right into judah through the children through the next generation ahab and jezebel have another son and his name is ahaziah so when athaliah and jehovah have a son they name him ahaziah huh you think you can join friendship with false system and not have it influence you we can jehoshaphat can stay righteous amen he did stay righteous but what happened to his son what happened to his son's sons amen and instead of ahaz when jehoram amen when he died ahaziah did evil amen like the house of ahab because he had his mother to his counselor so as i became his counselor so now she's influencing the sun the sun has become evil amen now when the son dies she wipes out the whole line and now she takes authority over the entire system what is she doing she's following in the footsteps of lucifer the anointing that's upon her you see now when you go down through the bible from this point on amen there's so many times these families have the same names that's why it's sometimes so hard to read amen second king are kings and chronicles amen because the king of judah and the king of israel will have the same name amen jehoram jehoram ahaziah ahaziah who are we talking about and then sometimes they change the name to make it simpler so sometimes it's joram sometimes i don't remember even what it is jehoram sometimes is joe room and so you know you find out that we jehoshaphat thought he could just join that ecumenical thing and just become a friend and maybe win a brother amen but what happened is that corruption moved right down into his house and the next generation and then the next generation was corrupt that's the wicked side but i want to turn and look at another one in ruth chapter 3. now i want to contrast this ruth chapter 3 verse 1. we know ruth now had married an israelite man in moab she's a moabitess her her story's one of disaster there's famine her husband dies her brother-in-law dies her father-in-law dies her and her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law are left alone and they come back into the land and her sister-in-law goes turns back and but she stays faithful to naomi and they come into the land and they're trying to make a living trying to to to gather some barley and some wheat to survive and and naomi's going to come up with a plan here in chapter 3 so let's read it chapter 3 verse 1. then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz of our kindred with those maidens thou wast behold the when behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down that he shall mark you shall mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayeth unto me i will do i want you to catch this character of ruth it's already showed up before in the book of ruth when she decided to stay with naomi and said i'll go where you go your people will be my people your god will be my god will you die live i'll live where you die i'll die but here naomi her mother-in-law begins to give her instructions and she doesn't argue she doesn't say no i don't want to wear that or i don't want to go tonight i want to no she says all that you said i will do there's a reason god writes his bible this way amen because he's trying to show us the character of the true queen amen the true bride verse six and she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bait her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid look at how she even addresses herself i'm thy handmaid not high but low she always comes low i'm thy handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art near kinsmen he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has shown more kindness in the latter and then at the beginning insomuch as thou followest not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requires for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman you know what virtuous means strength here comes ruth into the land and weakness and humility and destitute and afflicted she doesn't come in royal pageantry she doesn't come with strength she doesn't come with with goods and and servants she comes with nothing she comes destitute amen and then for a living she starts amen gathering amen just what little bit she can behind the reapers and it's just enough for her to name me to survive they have nothing amen but but when she comes at the at the commandment of naomi she is giving herself amen to an older man because he says thou has shown more kindness in thy ladder and then at that first because thou seekest not after young men whether rich or poor you're not here for lust you're not here for your own gain you're here for redemption for naomi amen and he says all the city does know that you're a strong woman see strength is not always what it looks like strength is inward and strength is character she had the character and they knew she had the character he knew she had the character and he was going to redeem her said oh all the city of my people does know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that i am thy near kinsmen albeit there is a kinsman nearer than i so he goes to do the work of the kinsmen redeemer and we know that she's redeemed and redemption comes in naomi and we know the whole story but i wanted to take this snapshot to show what was the character of ruth amen what was the being displayed in her approach how did she approach into boaz did she march up to him in the middle of the day did she come up and say i need this and i need that and don't you see and and why won't you do something for us but she comes with humility as a handmaid now she's surrendering self to the headship of an older man she's not doing it for any personal amen gain what we say is personal gain she's doing something for redemption purposes and because naomi told her to and she says throw thy skirt over me cover me for thou art in their kinsmen and the man is moved by her humility her surrender her sacrifice and because of that she becomes one of the queens of the bible not because she was like vashti or jezebel or athaliah but because she was like sarah and rebecca like esther and like ruth who do you want to be like i'll take the way with the lord's despise for you i want to look at one more lady here in first kings chapter 1. i want to look at bathsheba but not at the time of the fall i'm going to look at later in life in this part of the scriptures david is quite elderly he's about to pass off the scene and adani has come up with a plan to try to usurp himself or exalt himself to the throne in first kings chapter 1 verse 11 it says wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba so nathan the prophet comes to bathsheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that adonaija the son of haggath doth rain and david our lord knoweth it not now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon go and get thee into king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord o king swear unto thine handmaids saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon the throne why then doth adonai reign behold while thou yet talk us there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words and bathsheba went in unto the king and to the chamber and the king was very old and abyshak the shunammite ministered unto the king and bathsheba bowed and did obscenes unto the king and the king said what wouldest thou and she said unto him my lord thou swearest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaids saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest did not and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep and abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and abethar the priest and job the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou shouldst tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders and lo while she yet talked with him the king nathan the prophet also came in and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonai shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne and he has gone down this day and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep and abundance and hath called all the king's sons and the captains of the host and they be ether the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adenija but me even me thy servant and zodac the priest in bania the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not showed it unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came unto the king's presence and stood before the king and the king swear and said as the lord liveth that hath redeemed my soul of all distress even as i swear unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assurely solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence the king and said let my lord king david live forever bathsheba now has a situation that that's troubling because adonis is taking the throne but but the lord david had already told her i'm going to have solomon reign in my stead so she already has the word of david amen and now nathan the prophet comes into her and says here's what you want to do the king doesn't know it go in and remind him amen of what he told you and she goes in and says lord did you not say then nathan comes and confirms what she says and the king calls her back and says i will do what i said do listen bathsheba didn't need an army bathsheba didn't need soldiers bathsheba didn't need political allies all that bathsheba needed to do was get in the presence of the king and said king did not you say i still believe you and i believe what you said to be true amen sometimes we need to come into god's presence and not complain and not beg and not people say god did you not say i believe what you said to be true did you not say that by your stripes i'm healed i believe that to be true lord i remember i was talking to brother bernie sand martin about his testimony of god delivering him from from the neuropathy that it was left over from shingles and he says i didn't keep asking god to heal me but i kept telling god that i still believe oh praise god not demanding not telling god do this and do that and do that but coming in humility in reverence and say lord i still believe amen i'm having these symptoms but i still believe amen not saying god you've got to god you do and right now not anything like that but coming to the lord and saying lord i still believe your word i still believe and bathsheba come and said lord david did you not say am i mistaken or did you not say and the king upheld his word she didn't have to go call the egyptians she didn't have to go get another army she didn't have to do what adonijah did adonijah didn't go to the king adenija took it upon himself adenizer exalted himself and he made political allies and he got people together and he gave a bunch of gifts out to get the support of the people but bathsheba didn't need to do that all she needed to do was get in the presence of the king and say king i believe what you said and i remember what you said i'm just telling you i still believe i said i want to say god under every circumstance i still believe what you said i'm not going to panic i'm not going to go make my own way i'm not going to manipulate i'm not going to control but i'm going to come back into your presence and bow myself in ob essence before you and say lord your word said and i still believe your word you said you would and i still believe you will ruth didn't have to manipulate the situation all she had to do was do what naomi said bathsheba just did what the prophet of god said and reminded the lord she believed and i believe that's the same pattern the bride can take we can come in humility and reverence not demanding not controlling not manipulating not saying lord i trust you and then going to talk to everybody under the sun about our problems lord i trust you to take care of this but can you help me can you help me can you help me can you help me i'm not trying to get somebody to go talk to somebody who can talk to somebody who can but just say lord i trust you i believe you i want to show true virtue on the inside that there's a strength of character that says i don't need to control the situation all i need to go is stand before the one who controls the situation and say i still believe you would you cover your skirt over me lord would you take care of me i'm your handmaid i'm your servant i'm nothing but what you make me but i'm here showing you reverence and respect and honor and saying i still believe your word oh i believe that attitude would move the heart of god not like jezebel not like athaliah those things are all failures but like the humility of character of the ones who can't do anything jezebel had strength she was a princess before she knew how to manipulate how to do athleia had strength because she comes from a king's house she could manipulate she could do but sarah what could sarah do what strength did she have what could ruth do what could she do what could any of these women do they didn't have what the other women had and what can the humble little bride of christ really do compared with the great big conglomeration of the churches but she's got virtue that they can never have she's got the very nature and character of christ she has what was different between michael and the devil and then the bible says in jude when they were disputing over the body of moses michael did not even bring a railing accusation against the devil he just said the lord deal with thee tell me who had more character who had more strength christ didn't have to defend himself he didn't have to manipulate the situation he didn't have to go get people on his side because there was people against him all he had to do was stand still and let god work it out amen praise god i want to read one more quote here musicians if you could come brother remember said again the kind of woman that a man would choose would reflect his ambition and his character what kind of woman do they have jews [Music] what kind of woman did boaz choose i think christ is choosing the right kind of woman let's all stand esther when she entered into that when she entered into that palace esther had nothing going for her she didn't have a reputation she didn't have wealth she didn't she didn't come from the most likely source to be the next queen esther had nothing going for her but the predetermined will of god she didn't have connections she didn't she didn't have she had nothing going for her who knows what other women were gathered and what things they had going for but we know vashti was a great woman but esther entered into that situation with nothing and she may have come in the lowest but it wasn't long till the lowest was taken to the highest amen and and joseph when joseph entered into egypt he entered in the lowest amen but he entered in in humility as a slave and was sold into slavery amen and then from there he got a little bit of an exaltation that was cast into the prison now and he went as low as he could go in egypt down into the dungeon but from the dungeon when it was god's time and he remained faithful and had the right virtue and right character when it was time god brought him from the lowest to the highest and esther was brought from the lowest to the highest amen and ruth was brought from her low condition to a high condition amen and the bride of jesus christ is being brought through humility and subjection and reverence and she is going to be exalted and she will sit with him in his throne even as he is overcome and sit in his father's tongue and how is she going to do it through virtue the character of christ reflected in her i say god help us to reflect your character to have true virtue not false strength of alliances and human endeavors and reasoning and wisdom but true virtue that can stand still and say god knows and i'm in god's hands and when i am tried like gold when i am tried with fire i shall come forth like gold god is able now when we get in all these situations we get into our lives and we start when we start to react to the situation around us let's go back and say who am i reflecting in my reaction and say god help me i trust in you god i'm not telling you what to do i'm only telling you that i need you i'm not telling you what you need to do i'm only telling you that i need you and i'm telling you i'm telling you that i love you i reverence you i bow before you and i still believe what you said in your word that's a much better approach when brother bernie told me that something inside of me clicked and said that's it that's the right approach god i'm not telling you what to do i'm not telling you when to do it i'm not telling you how to do it you already have that figured out all i'm telling you is i love you with all my heart and i trust you with all my being and whatever you say is right but i want you to know i'm still believing your word did you not say that by your stripes you healed all my diseases oh what an approach friends i think it matters to god how we approach him the whole temple was structured for the right approach to god the whole worship that was given through moses and the tabernacle in the temple were always the right approach to god and i said god help me to have the right reproach and my approach to you will reflect the character that you're looking for inside of me man let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you for your word for your word is so beautiful and so perfect lord god every scripture every line the genealogies the the stories the histories lord it's all telling the same story over and over again god you've given us eyes to see but we're asking lord for more of that eye salve that we might see better than we've ever seen before you know when we see lord may we may we lord find that character that you're looking for and surrender ourselves to it god for without you we can do nothing but god tonight we want to lay ourselves at your feet again and say lord break all of that selfishness off of me lord all of my self-will all of my self-exaltation all of that whether it came genetically through history whatever it is lord break that all off of me lord so that i can reflect your character let your spirit live in me lord so that i can be a reflection of your life on this earth god how we love you how we thank you lord i pray lord that you would bless us as we move from here and tomorrow as i go to travel lord i go in your hands trusting in your leadership for i know you have a purpose and a plan i pray that you would take care of the assembly here and the services and the ministers who will minister let your word go forth in a mighty way god may we come together again as you will lord and share the testimonies of what you have done god we just trust ourselves into your hands and we love you lord we surrender our will into yours and thank god lord we thank you for all you've done and all that you've taken care of in the past and we trust that you'll do the same from here on out god make us more like you make us to reflect you lord take that word lord and carve away all that's not you and chip it all away lord so that that reflection is reflecting back the word that we're looking at we love your father and we ask that you would help us to serve you with all of our hearts lord and to walk lord the way you would walk in this world we ask your blessings in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you john [Music] [Music] jehovah god
