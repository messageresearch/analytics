[music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many of you know that in Nigeria there's a bitter persecution against many Christians here. And I had a brother that I know fairly well, brother Gideon Owen Kunlay. He sent me this prayer request for us to read. Says, "Dear saints, please kindly remember brother Maru Garba and four other brethren in pastor Gondu's church at Mat Makater Gibby state in prayers. The bandits, kidnappers, terrorists attacked their village in the early hours of today and took many people away in captivity, including these five brethren. Please kindly pray for divine intervention and that the good Lord will grant our brethren and a host of others total deliverance from the hands of these evil men. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's one thing when you hear something in the news, but when it comes home like this, so we just want to bow our heads together and pray, you just sit it here. Dear heavenly father, we thank you Lord so much for the blessing Lord you've given us of gathering here. But at the same time we're here in peace and safety Lord. There's been an attack and a village and our brethren along with many others have been taken captive Lord. And God I pray you who can control king's hearts. You can control destinies and nations and powers. You can rise up and you can tear down. You can open the Red Sea. You can stop the turning of the earth and the movement of the sun. you can certainly deliver our brethren. Lord, we pray, God, that you would supernaturally intervene in this need and deliver them and restore them back to their families and their homes. [music] Bring safety to them and the many others who are undergoing a bitter persecution. [music] May you, Lord, undertake for their behalf. May you come and bring changes, Lord. And God, I pray, Lord, that you would move on the scene and show your mighty hand. For God, you are mighty to deliver. God, I pray you'd bless us as we remember them, not just tonight, but from the in the future. God, may we pray until we see your hand move. And God, tonight as we look into your word, I [clears throat] pray, Father, that you would just move on us. Move on us mightily, Lord. Move away all the cloudiness of the day and all the stresses and pressures of life. And may we just have a time to relax in your presence, Lord. May we open our hearts and receive from you as you feed into our souls the precious words of life. May the light strike us, Lord, and bring us into a greater revelation. May we walk more pleasing to you in all ways. We love you. I pray you take care take this vessel under your control and [music] speak your words of eternal life to our hearts. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. And may God bless you. If you could turn to the book of First John. Thank you. Amen. 1 John chapter 4 and let's look at verse 14. First John chapter 4:14. [cough and clears throat] And we have seen and do testify that the Lord that the father sent the son to be savior of the world. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world. [clears throat] There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment. He that fearth is not made perfect in love. We love him because he first loved us. Amen. God bless you. As you have your seats, amen. Before we get into the PowerPoint to the slides, I just want to uh remind you that this Sunday, Brother Andreas Ringan from Germany will be here. So, be remembering him in prayer as he's traveling. And traveling's not been easy lately and it's getting more difficult. So, just pray that everything will work out perfect for our brother as he flies in. Um he'll [clears throat] be coming in on Friday, Lord willing. Uh also the next week, the following week after that, uh that brother Jason Demar will be preaching for us on November 16th. So be praying for that. And then he's going to be preaching at the youth meeting in the afternoon. So we'll take the Sunday morning service here and then the youth meeting. So remember both of those things in prayer if you will, please. Amen. So but for tonight, you got me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. So [cough] if you could pull up the PowerPoint, please. I want to preach on a love that produces works. And we when we read through this, we find out that if we dwell in love, we dwell in him. For God is love. And then what the last verse we read is we love him because he first loved us. &gt;&gt; And we find out, I've said this many times, but our love for God is reciprocal love. God loved us first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God didn't love us, we couldn't love him back. Amen. So if we find ourselves loving God, it's because he loved us first. We love him because he first loved us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as as we look at this here, uh we're going to look in Jeremiah. Jeremiah 31 says, "The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, "Yay, have I loved thee with an everlasting love." &gt;&gt; Therefore, with loving kindness have I drawn thee. Why was Jeremiah drawn to God? Because God already loved him with an everlasting love. &gt;&gt; Before he was born, God called him to be a prophet to the nations. So God knew him and God loved him and God called him. Amen. And so so I have loved thee with an everlasting love. I don't think that applies only to Jeremiah, but how many believe it applies to you, too? &gt;&gt; So the reason I'm getting into this and I want to look at this is we love God because he first loved us. So he loved us first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he loved Jeremiah with an everlasting love. So Jeremiah didn't have to do anything to earn this kind of love. This love came before Jeremiah was born and it's a love that can't change. &gt;&gt; So, it's a love that is not dependent on Jeremiah's behavior or conduct. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; Uh, we're in Malachi. We know this one really well, but I'm going to read Malachi and then Romans. Malachi 1. I have loved you, sayaeth the Lord. He's speaking to Israel that yet ye say, wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? Sayeth the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau. So, brother Ram goes to the scripture and shows that God's love is elective love. He loved us from before the foundation of the world. And and we we read the same thing in Romans 9 when Paul writes, "For this is the word of promise." At this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth. It was said unto her, "The elder shall serve the younger, as it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I love have I hated." So God according to election, according to his purpose, he had already determined, he had already declared that I loved Jacob and he hated Esau before. Uh I'm going to I'm going to highlight this as we go. For the children being not yet born, &gt;&gt; neither having done good or evil, that the purpose according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth. God wasn't waiting to find out if Jacob was going to do good and be a good boy and then he'll choose to love him. But God loved him before. And we know that when we look at the life of Jacob and Esau, Amen. Esau was the better man. Esau had the better characteristics, the better traits. Amen. He was more faithful to his father. Amen. And all of these other things. But it did that didn't matter because God had known him before. And he was in the mind of God before and in the plan of God before. So before he did any good or evil, one was chosen and one was not. &gt;&gt; That the purpose of God according to election might stand. And the reason we we get into this is because I'm talking about a amen a love that produces works. Because works is an outcropping of love, not of any desire or need to be accepted by God. We've already been accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; He loved us before with an everlasting love. So we don't do things to get God's approval. Well, we already have God's approval. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, that has to go that that has to be put to rest from the very beginning. We have to start with that foundation. Amen. Because if we start with the foundation that I'm working my way up into acceptance with God and I'm hoping someday to be accepted, that's a Catholic doctrine where you never are assured of your salvation, but you're always hoping to be good enough and to have a shorter stay in purgatory and maybe someday to pass from purgator. Listen, it's not that way at all. The purpose of God according to election stands. God knows whom he's chosen &gt;&gt; and he's loved them with an everlasting love. Amen. So there's no fear. Amen. We're not fearful of not making it. We're not fearful of not being uh uh uh good enough to be accepted by God. All of that has to be put to rest. &gt;&gt; Must be in Galatians. Now we're going to read two places out of Galatians. Paul writes, "I'm crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not frustrate the grace of God. For if righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. If I can become righteous by doing the deeds of the law, then Jesus died in vain. But he died because there was nothing I can do to become righteous by good deeds. Amen. So he has declared me righteous by faith. And he's paid the price of redemption and the price of sanctification to free me from the bondage of sin and from my old life. Amen. So that I can be declared righteous in Christ. &gt;&gt; So he lives. I now live in the flesh. I live by the faith of the son of God. &gt;&gt; That's not faith in the son of God, but the very faith of God has delivered him and he's living that life in the flesh. Now, by that faith who loved me and gave himself for me. This is Paul writing this and and it's amazing. Paul looks to this the Calvary and he can say the son of God loved me and gave himself for me. And Paul didn't know it till after the deed was done. That means Jesus Christ loved Paul and gave himself for Paul. Before Paul met the pillar of fire, before Paul could do good things, before Paul could submit to the word, for before Paul could agree with the word, Amen. Jesus Christ loved him and gave himself for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a consolation. That's why Paul was not going to frustrate the grace of God. Galatians 5, he says, "Stand fast, therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free." "And be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage." He's talking about the law. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law. Christ has become of no effect unto you. Whosoever of you are justified by the law, you are fallen from grace. For we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avaleth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which workketh by love. &gt;&gt; So how does faith work? By love. Because he loved me and gave himself for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And my faith workketh by love, not by the deeds of the law. Amen. So in adoption, Brother Ben says, "I don't live true to my wife because I think she'd divorce me. I live true to my wife because I love her." It's a legal position that we have taken that we love one another. First, before it could be there, it had to be a love. I love her. Although I believe if I done something wrong, she'd forgive me. Still, I wouldn't do it anyhow. I love her. That's the way it is with Christ. He said, "I'm 50. If I live to be 90 or 100, if I have another 50 years to preach and I never preach a time and I go down and set on the river, I'm saved anyhow. God saved me by his grace unmmerited of anything I could ever do, did do, or anything else. I preach because I love him and I love his people. &gt;&gt; But brother Benham was very clear. He wasn't serving God because he needed to serve God to to be saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; He He says, "If I live another 50 years and never preach another sermon, not another single time, and just go down sit on the river, I'm saved." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm saved anyhow. Because he's saved by grace. And we know that for for by grace are you saved through faith in that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. Amen. In grace, brother says, "Grace and love are twin sisters." Because God can't prefer you or give you a favor unless he loves you. He loves you and extended grace to you. And you apprehended that grace through faith. And that faith is not even your own. It is a gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The faith that you have to believe in what God has done for you and that he loved you first and that he gave himself for you and by faith you now live this life by the faith of the son of God. Amen. So, brother Ben's super clear and he goes through this and and Paul's very clear on this. Brother Ben is very clear on this that you don't have to do anything to earn his love. You had his love before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Your names are written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. He loved you before with an everlasting love. &gt;&gt; You were saved before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "You weren't saved on any certain day. You were always saved." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? We went through that. I believe uh on Sunday, you were always saved because in the mind of God, you were always saved. In the lamb's book of life, you were always in the book of redemption. You were sealed under the blood before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I don't need to do works to be saved. And I don't need to do works to find favor with God. Amen. I already have favor. That's what grace is, is favor to me &gt;&gt; and it's already there. But brother Ben said, "I don't just love my wife because I'm afraid she'll divorce me. I love her because I love her." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's simple. &gt;&gt; In the in the book of James here, it says, "Thou believest that there is one God. Thou doest well. The de the devils also believe and tremble. But willil thou know, oh vain man, that faith without works is dead?" Faith without works is dead. Amen. We can go in the reverse. We know works without faith will not produce any life. &gt;&gt; That's what trying to keep the law, Amen, and trying to do good works, Amen. to have faith, that won't work. Works without faith will not produce salvation. &gt;&gt; But James tells us that faith without works is dead, being alone. And he shows, he begins to tell us, amen, show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my works because what I believe, amen, the real genuine faith and the love of God will produce something in me and there'll be a life that will manifest behind that love. Behind that genuine faith will will bring about a life and you will see works. We've seen it all through the Bible because the Bible is full of good works that people did who met God and loved God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so faith without works is dead. Jesus says in John 14:15, "If you love me, keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; When we look at this, Christ's love for us is never in question. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Christ's love for us is not in question. It's our love for him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's our response to him. &gt;&gt; If you love me, keep my commandments. I'll say this also. Jesus never demanded anybody obey him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He never demanded He never demanded anybody obey him. He simply said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; It's your choice. Amen. You did not demanded. It wasn't commanded. Anybody who wanted to walk away could walk away any time. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't demand anybody obey him. He just gave his word. And he says, "If you love me, keep my commandments." So his love for us is not the question. And it's our love for him &gt;&gt; that's in question. So brother Bam is referring here in the Sardisian church age to the first age. He said the first church age was the Ephesian church age from AD55 to 170. Paul being the star and it was the first church age. Works without love was God's complaint. What was God's complaint in the first age? Works without love. Because the first stage in in Revelation chapter 2, it starts off, I know thy works and thy labor and thy patience. &gt;&gt; Starts off with works and labor and patience. Endurance. Amen. And he recognized that. But when he comes down a little further, he says, "But I have somewhat against thee. Thou has left thy first love." They kept the works. They kept the labor, but they lost the love. And his complaint against them was works without love. Amen. So God's not looking for a works program. God's looking for somebody that'll love him back. &gt;&gt; He's already loved us. We love him because he first loved us. He's looking for the reciprocal love. And Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commands." You don't have to. &gt;&gt; You don't have to, but if you love me, keep my commandments. It's voluntary. And it's an outcropping of love. What is the keeping of the commandments? It's not fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not it's not any of those things. The the keeping of Jesus' commandments is love. Because that's what Jesus told us to do. If we love him, keep his commandments. He didn't say, "Keep my commandments." He said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's it's an outflow of love. &gt;&gt; It's it's a reciprocation of his love to us. It's a recognition of all he's done for me. How could I not love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the complaint was works without love. So faith without works is dead, but works without love is not pleasing to God either. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look here at the rich young ruler. We've been through this scripture a lot. But he comes to Jesus said, "Master, good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus tells him to keep the commandments. He said, "I've done all this from my youth." And it says, "Then Jesus beholding him loved him." &gt;&gt; I This is so good. Jesus loved him first &gt;&gt; before he told him what he was going to tell him next. He loved him. &gt;&gt; He wasn't waiting to see if he would obey or not. &gt;&gt; Before he gave the commandment, he loved him. And because he loved him, he gave him the commandment. So the commandment was an outflow of Jesus's love for this rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; Because he loved him, he would tell him what he needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus told him what he needed, he says, "And he said unto them, one thing thou lackest. Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven. and come take up the cross and follow me. And he was sad at the saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions. Jesus was looking at this man [clears throat] and Jesus did not tell him to go sell all that he had because he disliked him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because he wanted to punish him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because he wanted to see whether or not he's worthy of my love. No, Jesus loved him. That's why he gave him the commandment. And the commandment was an expression of love &gt;&gt; because he knew that this man was bound by something. And he says, "You've done all the commandments. You've been to church. You've paid. You've done all of these things, but there's one thing you're lacking. And I love you enough to tell you where your problem is." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the man looked at the commandment that Jesus gave. Cuz listen, this is a commandment. Right. &gt;&gt; One thing thou lackest, go thy way, sell all thou hast, give to the poor. Thou shalt have treasures in heaven, and then take up thy cross, AND FOLLOW ME. HE'S INVITED NOW INTO FELLOWSHIP with Jesus. Amen. And the man looks at this and he doesn't see this as love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he looks at what Jesus told him, sell all of that I have, give it to the poor. Amen. Then take up my cross and follow him. And it SAYS HE WAS SAD AT THE SAYING, NOT REJOICING because Jesus loved him. He wasn't feeling loved. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we on the same page? HE HE DIDN'T SAY, "OH, he is so loving. &gt;&gt; That was the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me." No, he walked away sad &gt;&gt; and went away grieved &gt;&gt; for he had great possessions. See, it was this this is not an issue of whether or not Jesus loved this man. &gt;&gt; It's whether or not he loved Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; It he could have said all that he wanted to say. Oh rabbi, oh great master. He could have called him all kinds of wonderful titles of adearment and then he could he ran up and he bowed down before him and showed honor and respect and and it looked like he was loving this master and it looked like he was surrendering to the master. But when this when Jesus Christ looked at him and loved him, HIS LOVE CAUSED him to tell him the truth about his situation and give him a commandment that would not hinder him, bind him, hurt him. He gave him a word that would free him. &gt;&gt; And this man walked away from freedom because the freedom that Jesus offered looked like bondage. &gt;&gt; It looked like poverty. It looked like heartbreak. It looked like heartache. It looked unfair. It looked uh you could imagine he thought that's uh that that's irresponsible for him to say that. That's an EXTREME STATEMENT THAT NOBODY else has to do that. How could he say that to me? He he's over the top. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a bit legalistic. &gt;&gt; But Jesus told him because he loved him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, if we could look at every commandment of God that way and everything that he taught us and all that the word instruct us and then everything that HE TAUGHT US THROUGH A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How to live in this age, how to live in Leodysia, what to stay away from, what's what's acceptable God, what's not. Amen. There's it's a shame that some people look at that and they think that's hard preaching and that's bondage and that's legalism. Listen friends, that's freedom from Leodysian spirits. It's freedom from bondage. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE FASHIONS OF THE WORLD. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE TRAPPINGS OF THE DEVIL. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP WITH THE entertainments of Leodysia. AND A PROPHET CAME ALONG TO HE WAS THE VOICE OF GOD IN OUR AGE, IN OUR GENERATION. AMEN. TO FREE US from the things that bind us. And it's a shame that so many people look at the LOVE OF GOD EXPRESSED TO THEM AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE LOVE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY WALK AWAY FROM A CHURCH SERVICE OR LISTENING to a message UH READING A BOOK AND THEY WALK AWAY SAD. AND THEY WALK AWAY GRIEVED. AMEN. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP THINGS OF THE WORLD. THEY won't want to give up entertainments AND THINGS THAT BRING PLEASURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And it's NOT THE QUESTION OF uh who loves who. JESUS SPOKE IT BECAUSE HE LOVES US. &gt;&gt; He wants us to be free. THIS MAN WAS RICH. This man was religious. THIS MAN DID ARMS DEEDS. THIS MAN FOLLOWED THE COMMANDMENTS FROM HIS YOUTH. HE DID EVERYTHING that looked good TO HIM. EVERYTHING THAT MADE HIM FEEL LIKE he was worthy of eternal life. &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS BOUND BY HIS RICHES. &gt;&gt; RELIGIOUS GOING TO CHURCH, KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS IN BONDAGE TO RICHES. AND HOW, BROTHER CHAD, HOW DO YOU KNOW HE was in bondage to riches? Cuz when Jesus GAVE HIM A COMMANDMENT, HE COULDN'T FOLLOW JESUS CUZ JESUS INVITED HIM, "COME AND FOLLOW ME." BUT HE TURNED HIS BACK ON JESUS AND WALKED AWAY CUZ HE was bound by his riches. &gt;&gt; And he saw the commandment as a hardship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Instead of freedom and instead of love. [snorts] And so he was receiving the love of Jesus, but he couldn't respond in love &gt;&gt; because he loved himself &gt;&gt; and his riches more than he loved Jesus. &gt;&gt; And and it sounds like a hard statement to say, but it's nothing but the truth &gt;&gt; because Jesus says, "Sell all of that and come &gt;&gt; follow me." It's an invitation to fellowship. It's an invitation to be with him and be part of his program. Come and follow me. But what he wanted was his riches more than he wanted to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was bound by his riches and the word of God was his freedom. And it was love, but he couldn't receive it as love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because he didn't receive it as love, he didn't respond in love. because we love him. Because he first loved us. And when we see the commandments of God as his love, then when we love him, we keep his commandments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a response of love, not of fear, &gt;&gt; not of trying to gain acceptance. It's an absolute responding of love. Jesus Jesus says in John 15, "As the Father have loved me, so have I loved you. Continue ye in my love. If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at this statement. Uh, if you keep my commandments, if you shall abide in my love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we don't understand what Jesus is saying, it looks like he's saying, "If you don't keep my commandments, you won't have my love &gt;&gt; or I won't love you." That's not true. Jesus love for the rich young ruler never changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He still loved him. He loved him before he gave him the commandment. He loved him before the man chose right or wrong. He loved him first. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he loved him, he told him the truth. Now he says, "If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love." Look at this. Even as I've kept my father's commandments and abide in his love. &gt;&gt; So, could Jesus ever be beyond the love of God, the love of the father? No. He He wasn't in jeopardy of not being loved by the father. &gt;&gt; Right? You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, "If you keep my commandments, you'll abide in my love even as I have kept my father's commandment and abide in his love." &gt;&gt; So think about this, friends. The father's love is not changing for Jesus, for the son. &gt;&gt; But when the son keeps the commandments, he abides in the love that's already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't receive new love or more love or greater love or lose love. The love's already there. But when he keeps the commandment, WHICH IS LOVE, HE ABIDES IN THE LOVE. And Jesus tells us it's the same thing for us in him. If you keep my commandments, YOU ABIDE or live or dwell or remain in my love because my commandment is my love. &gt;&gt; IS MY LOVE EXPRESSED TO YOU BECAUSE I LOVE this young man. AMEN. I TOLD HIM the truth. So my commandment was my love and he walked away from my love. So he no longer could abide in my love. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean Jesus didn't love him. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MEAN JESUS LOVE FOR HIM CHANGED. BUT HE COULDN'T ABIDE IN HIS LOVE. TO ABIDE IN HIS LOVE, HE WOULD HAVE KEPT HIS COMMANDMENT, sold all he had, give to the poor, took up his cross, and followed Jesus. And he would BE ABIDING IN THE LOVE THAT WAS ALREADY THERE AND REMAINED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But he left the love of Jesus. The love Jesus had for him didn't leave. &gt;&gt; Does the scripture make sense? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is not saying, "I'm going to withhold love from you now cuz you didn't do what I said." &gt;&gt; He's not fickle like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But [clears throat] his commandment is love. &gt;&gt; And if you keep his commandment, you abide in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's never a problem with the Lord. The problem's always with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's never failed us. He's never failed to love us. He's never failed to tell us the truth. He's never failed to extend his love and mercy unto us. It's never his failure. It's always ours. Amen. When I think about just this statement, the worthiness of God to be obeyed. Just if we could just reflect on this for a minute. God who is the supreme being, the deity, the creator of all heavens and earth. We have no life without him. &gt;&gt; There is no creation without him. There is nothing without him. &gt;&gt; Just on that basis alone, he's worthy to be obeyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then on top of that, he's expressed such love towards us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that he chose us before the foundation. He loved us. He came down himself in a body of flesh and was brutally tortured and died and shed his own blood so that we could go free because he loved us that much. HOW COULD WE NOT LOVE HIM BACK? &gt;&gt; And I wrote this. I wrote this statement earlier today. I said, "Surrendering to the sheer wonder of his magnificence should be the natural response of a revelation of his awesomeness." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I read that again? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Surrendering to the sheer wonder of his magnificence should be the natural expression of a revelation of his awesomeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; NOT SO I CAN GET something out of him. Not so I can get treats because I'm a good boy and I I'm like a dog and I I DID THE TRICK AND I GET THE TREAT. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. I SHOULD GIVE HIM MY WHOLE LIFE JUST BECAUSE HE'S AMAZING. &gt;&gt; Just because how WONDERFUL HE IS, HOW AWESOME HE IS, HOW ARUCK I AM BY HIS MAJESTY. HE IS GOD. AMEN. HE HAS DONE ALL THIS ALONE. AMEN. NOT EVEN IF HE NEVER DID A THING FOR ME, I SHOULD PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO HIM BASED ON HIS CHARACTER ALONE, &gt;&gt; BASED ON HIS PERFECTION, BASED ON HIS HIS AWESOMENESS. YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. How did we get to be created BEINGS? AMEN. WHO WOULD SNUB their nose and turn THEIR BACK AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANTED TO OBEY GOD'S LAW? HOW FOOLISH. HOW TRIVIAL. I MEAN, YOU TALK ABOUT RIDICULOUS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He is awesome and worthy of our respect and obedience. If he never did a thing for us, &gt;&gt; he's worthy of respect and obedience. &gt;&gt; How do we get to the place where we decide what we want to listen to and what we don't want to listen to? What pride in the human race. &gt;&gt; What shameful pride. If you look at 1 John 5, it says, "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. And everyone that loveth him that begth loveth him also that is begotten of him. By this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievious." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Did the rich young ruler walked away grieved? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The commandment was grievious to him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If he only could weigh what he was exchanging. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It would not have been a grievous commandment. It would have been a glorious commandment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So his commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievious. So the question is not whether God loves us or not. The question is whether we love him or not. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. In the Thotyron church age, brother Bram says, "I know your love, service, faith, and patience. You will note that their love is placed between works and service." And that is the right place for it because without love, our works are not accepted before God, and neither is our service. Paul speaking to the Corinthians said, "Without love, I am nothing. And whatever I do is without profit, unless it is done in love." Now, you can see right here that these believers weren't in that nickelan class that did works as a means of salvation or to be admired by men. They did their works out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost. That's the way I want to do works. &gt;&gt; I want to serve God because I love him. Because he first loved me. And if I could give more of my life, I want to give more of my life to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Christ is revealed in his own word. The prophet was telling a story here. He says, "I've been this week down in the country staying with with some very dear friends. I asked some of them at the table yesterday when we was eating. We always sit around and have a like a little study on the Bible. We was talking about love and there was a certain person said to me, he said, "I believe you're an antichrist." I said, "If that would be pleasing to my Lord, that's what I want to be. I want to be whatever he wants me to be. I love him. [clears throat] And if he should cast me into hell, I still will love him. If I go with the same spirit I have now, he looked at me kind of strange. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But brother M showing us a genuine love for God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's not tied to a love of self, but just a love for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I seen four or five of them there. Young men, young wives, fine women. I know how them boys love their wives. So I said to them, I said, "Here's the way to test it. If your wife before you were married, now you go back, say this married life, you've been dreaming you were married. You really wasn't married, but you dreamed you were. And you woke up and you went and talked it over with your girlfriend and said, "You know, I dreamed that we were married and we had children. We were living happy, waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything." And then this girl would say to you, "You know, I love another man better than I love you. I could be happier with the other man. Could you from your heart love her well enough to say, "God's blessing rest upon you, my dear. Go with this other man." Now, now check that each of you men or you women. See, well, if your love is correct, you would do that for you are interested in her welfare. What you know you could have her, you can live with her. She she's your wife or she will be. She'll marry you, but she won't be happy. She would be happier. And then if you love her, then you want her to be happy. Therefore, whatever the will of God is, let God's will be done, whether I'm happy with it or not. &gt;&gt; I want to live so he will be pleased with what I do. Therefore, check your objective and your motive. By that, you know, whether you love God or not. What if he said, what what if he'd say, "You serve me if I'm going to cast you away. I love you anyhow." Brother showing us how we should love God. Whether I'm wh sorry I did it again. I crossed it out. Whether I'm happy with it or not, I want to live so he'll be pleased with what I do. &gt;&gt; I want his his command, his desire, his will to be supreme in my life because I love him. And I surely want to love him more than I love myself. &gt;&gt; But you realize, friends, that's the struggle we're struggling with. This old flesh wants demands attention and time and protection and all these things. We're struggling with the love of self versus the love of God. But I want him to have supreme authority in my life. I want him to be the one that I love. &gt;&gt; Let self take a backseat. &gt;&gt; John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that he gave." He demonstrated love to us. God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son. What did love compel him to do? Give. What does love compel me to do? Get or give? &gt;&gt; It compels me to give. &gt;&gt; Lord God left as a an example. He loved the world. Amen. So he gave. If I love, I'll give. Amen. It's not about what I can get. It's about what I can give. &gt;&gt; Says, we realize that in this in doing this, it pleased God so well to see that Abraham loved him above everything else on earth, even his only son. He loved him above what anybody could say, anybody could do. He still loved God enough to believe his word. All Abraham's seed believes God like that. I said, "Oh, God, help me believe you like that." And he's referring to Abraham taking his son, his only son Isaac, up to Mount Mariah and and and binding his hands and laying him on an altar and raising a knife to slay him because God said, "Take thy son, thy only son Isaac, and sacrifice him unto me." And and Abraham loved God so much. He was going to obey God whether he understood the commandment or not. Whether he liked it or not, he come to the place in his relationship with God that he was he learned to trust him. He learned to love him. He learned to obey him so much that if he got a request that seemed absolutely ridiculous, outlandish, impossible, but he knew it was God speaking to him. He was going to obey because he loved God more than anything else. more than his son, MORE THAN HIS WIFE, MORE THAN HIMSELF, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, HE LOVED GOD. AND BROTHER, AND GOD WAS SO PLEASED WITH THIS, HE PUT HIM TO THE TEST. He put him to the moment. He got him to brother Bam said, he raised his hand WITH A KNIFE ABOUT THE PLUNGING INTO ISAAC'S HEART. And the angel of the Lord said, "STAY THY HAND." SAID, "NOW I KNOWEST THAT THOU fear God." &gt;&gt; God was so pleased with his actions. Amen. And and brother said, "All Abraham's seed believes God like that." I tell you friends, I don't know that I always do, but I want to. And I believe I'm Abraham's seed. And I want to love him more than I love anything else. WHY? BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED ME. LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME. I'M A NOBODY FROM NOWHERE. AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE IN THIS WORLD. I was a I WAS A RENEGADE. I WAS EVERYTHING ELSE AND TOSSED ABOUT AND AND AND IGNORANT AND BLIND AS CAN BE. AND GOD BROUGHT THIS MESSAGE TO ME AND HE OPENED MY EYES. HE REDEEMED me and he DREW ME TO HIMSELF. AND HE WHISPERED LOVE SECRETS IN MY EAR. AND HE OPENED UP THE BACK PART OF HIS MIND. HE UNVEILED HIMSELF IN THE HIDDEN CHAMBER AND SHOWED ME WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING FOR 6,000 7,000 YEARS. EVEN BEFORE THAT, WHAT HIS PLAN WAS before the foundation OF THE WORLD. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN? I KNOW THE SECRET THAT THE WHOLE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW. [screaming] AMEN. HOW COULD I NOT LOVE HIM? HOW COULD I NOT SERVE HIM? HOW COULD I TURN MY NOSE UP BECAUSE THE PROPHET SAYS SOMETHING THAT I DOESN'T THINK SOUND RIGHT WHEN GOD HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME? AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S AN ARROGANT, SELFISH SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; I OWE HIM EVERYTHING. WHAT? WHO WAS I THAT HE SHOULD COME AND REVEAL THE WORD TO ME? WHAT WISDOM DID I HAVE? WHAT INTELLIGENCE DID I HAVE? WHAT FAMILY CONNECTIONS DID I HAVE? I MEAN, WHAT WHAT WAS I? I WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN A DOT ON THE MAP, NOT EVEN A NUMBER ON A TALLY sheet somewhere. &gt;&gt; ONE OF 8 BILLION PEOPLE ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. WHO COULD FIND ONE OUT of eight billion? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF I PILED UP 8 billion anything here, &gt;&gt; I don't even know if it'd fit here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; and you go pluck one out and tell that one. You're precious to me and I love you and I'm going to tell you all my secrets. and I'm going to draw you to myself and I'm going to I'm going to give you a glorified body and you're going to sit with me in my throne for a thousand years and you're going to be in the new heavens and new earth and you're going to have perfection and you're going to BE PART OF ME. YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN EXPRESSION of me and we're going to come into a unity like nobody's ever seen before and we're GOING TO LIVE TOGETHER FOREVER. OH, WHAT WOULD THAT ONE LITTLE ITEM THAT'S PLUCKED OUT OF 8 BILLION FEEL ABOUT THE ONE WHO PLUCKED THEM OUT? YEAH, that's right. &gt;&gt; OH, GOD, HELP US NOT TO BE PROUD AND ARROGANT AND GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE THINK WE DESERVED it or we were owed it or &gt;&gt; I was good enough or he liked me or I had beautiful eyes. &gt;&gt; We had nothing. This was purely based on his love and election, &gt;&gt; not only merit of our own. And it should put inside of us such a tremendous passionate love for him &gt;&gt; that if he ASKED ME TO DROP EVERYTHING and go to the other side of the planet tomorrow, I should be willing to do it though it cost me everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's love. And &gt;&gt; I remember years ago when we come to the message, it was quite a tumultuous time for our family, for my wife and I, and lots of up and down and back and forth and confusion and disturbances from outside the family. But yet God draw us through and and and it brought us into such a relationship. We went through a relationship strain because of the unknown and because of the family pressures. But then all of a sudden when God brought us the revelation of the word, it threw us together in a union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like we'd never experienced before. And I remember one time after we'd been in the message for a while and God had taught us how to love one another and and taught us how a husband should care for a wife and a wife should reverence her husband. My wife looked at me one time and she said, "I would follow you anywhere on this planet. If you told us tomorrow you're picking up and moving to Alaska, I would go without question. And I just stood there. I don't remember what even the conversation was about. But listen friends, what love is that? &gt;&gt; What how could somebody how could a human being put such love and trust and respect into another failed human being? And you know what that did to me? When she said that to me, all of a sudden, I got this sense of responsibility &gt;&gt; that I would never lead that woman astray. And if I if I had to give my life, I wouldn't hurt her &gt;&gt; if she'll love me like that. &gt;&gt; And if a wife can have respect and love and reverence and trust to an earthly husband, what should the bride of Christ, how should she trust her husband? &gt;&gt; How should we TRUST HIM? NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS, whether I understand it or don't understand it, whether I like it or don't like it, whether it feels good or don't FEEL GOOD, WHAT DOES THAT MATTER, FRIENDS? AMEN. He's been everything to me. He's worthy OF MY TRUST. HAS HE NOT HE PROVED HIMSELF FAITHFUL? &gt;&gt; HAS NOT IS HE NOT TRUSTWORTHY? HAS NOT HE PROVED HOW much he loves us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could we not just say, "God, whatever you ask, wherever you go, whatever you want, I'll go wherever you go. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll be wherever you want me to be. I'll do whatever you ask me to do. I love you that much. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; That's real love. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the revealed in his own word. He says God said if a man has caught was caught in adultery a woman, take them out there and stoned them to death. That settled it. He's even caught picking up a weight of stick on the Sabbath day. Take him out and stone him. They lived by it then. And now see, we don't have them kind of laws today. But the Christian, the church, what I'm talking to this morning, the law of God is in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. The law was done away with because Jesus Christ fulfilled the law. He met every requirement of the law. So, we don't have to meet the requirements of the law. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean the law was evil. Paul says the law was perfect. &gt;&gt; The problem was not the law of God. The law of God came from the mind of God. It was the way to treat people, way to treat your neighbor, way to redeem things, way to love God, way to serve, Amen, your neighbor, way to live in a community. All those things were perfect. The wisdom OF GOD, DON'T CALL IT BAD. DON'T CALL IT WRONG. Paul called it perfect. &gt;&gt; The problem wasn't with the law. The problem was with us. We could never live it. So, we could never attain to THE RIGHTEOUSNESS WE SOUGHT after &gt;&gt; under the law. So Jesus Christ came and fulfilled all the law so that he could be the perfect substitute, the lamb without spot or blemish. And he took our place and stood in ourstead and he died on our behalf so that we could go free. So now we're not bound to the law to keep the ordinance of the law. BUT LISTEN, GOD still has wisdom. There's still a law OF GOD. THERE'S STILL A RIGHT way and there's still a wrong way to do things. And that may not be a law that we have to obey, amen, to seek righteousness from God. BUT IT'S A LAW NOW THAT'S in our heart. And the obedience is obedience from the heart. &gt;&gt; The law of God is in your heart. See, you have no desire to do it. It's inside here. You want to keep God's law so perfect. No matter what it is, you want to be just what if God needs a doormat at the door. He wants you to be that doormat. You're so happy to be that. No matter what it would be, you want to be the doormat. See, whatever God wants you to do, that's what you want to do cuz it's God. Now, that's where you really find your real, genuine, true love for God. &gt;&gt; Is not when I want God to make me something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When God, I want this position or God, I want to do this for you, but when God tells you he wants you to do something, AND IF IT'S THE DOORMAT AT THE DOOR, you're just so happy to be that. Brother Benham said, that's where you get the real true love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's look at John 21 together. Gospel of John chapter 21 and let's begin at verse 15. In John 21:15 it says, "So when they had died, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, [snorts] Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?" He saith unto him, "Yay, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee?" He saith unto him, "Feed my lambs." &gt;&gt; Amen. He saith to him again the second time," Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?' He saith unto him, "Yay, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee?" He saith unto him, "Feed my sheep." He saith unto him a third time,"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, "Lovest thou me?" And he said unto him, "Lord, thou knowest all things. Thou knowest that I love thee." Jesus said unto him, "Feed my sheep." &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus looking at Peter. You know, Peter had denied him three times and had failed the Lord. And here he comes with three opportunities for him to express his love to the Lord. Says, "Does thou love me?" He says, "Yes, I know." And then he says, "Feed my sheep." Peter's declaring his love for God. Jesus is giving him a commandment. &gt;&gt; And his commandment is love. &gt;&gt; The question is, "Do you love me?" Peter says, "Yes." Jesus says, "Feed my sheep." &gt;&gt; So, how will Peter express his love to Jesus? Not saying, "I love you," &gt;&gt; but feeding his sheep. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus is looking for. He what's he asking Peter to do? He's saying, "Peter, will you serve my people? Will you sacrifice yourself?" Listen, what he's asking Peter to do is not a glorious thing, not an easy thing. He's asking him to sacrifice his life. Peter had run away because he didn't know what to do was after the resurrection and there was confusion all about and there was some fear of the authorities and he went back to fishing and this is where Jesus finds him going back to familiar ground. Amen. And and running out of Jerusalem having no idea what next to do. They know Jesus died. They know he resurrected. They've seen him. Amen. They know it was a fulfillment of the word. And here they are. Amen. Back fishing again, back in familiar territory. And Jesus comes to him. Amen. And he and he and he says, "Do you love me?" And Peter finally he SAYS, "LORD, YOU KNOW ALL THINGS." &gt;&gt; Why are you asking ME THIS? YOU KNOW MY HEART. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW I love you. And after THIS OUTBURST OF GOD, YOU'VE GOT A GUARANTEE OF MY LOVE. WITH YOUR WITH YOUR OMNISCIENCE, YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU. &gt;&gt; He says the third time, "Feed my sheep." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. How did Jesus want Peter to express his love? &gt;&gt; By feeding his sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Simple. &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading. Verse 18. Jesus says, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when thou was young, thou girdst thyself, and walkest wheither thou wouldest. But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldest not. This spakey signifying by what death he should glorify God. That was the word of the Lord. That was not a pleasant prophecy or commandment. He didn't say, "I'm going to give you some rewards and I'm going to give you a comfortable life and I'm going to take care of you and your family and you're going to have a big church and you're going to have all of this." No. He just told him, "You're going to sacrifice your life for me. I've asked you to serve my people, not yourself. Serve my sheep." That means, you know, Peter didn't know how to do that. Peter didn't know how he would do that. He hadn't been to Pentecost yet. He hadn't received the Holy Ghost. He didn't have that overcoming power. He just knows Jesus is asking him to go out to do something he doesn't know how to do. It's overwhelming at this stage in his life to go and feed his sheep and feed his lambs. But what about the authorities? What about the ones who arrested you and accused you and our life is in danger and we're running for our lives? Then you're asking me to feed your sheep. Listen, this wasn't a jump up and click your heels. Oh boy, guess what I get to do kind of a commandment. This was a commandment that was going to cost Peter his life. And he even even sealed it with a prophecy of his crucifixion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The commandment of the Lord was for Peter to give his life. But he said, "If you love me, feed my sheep." And this is what's going to happen in verse and I want to finish verse 19. And when he had spoken this, he said unto him, follow me. &gt;&gt; That's the same opportunity he gave to the rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He told the rich young ruler, "Sell everything you got and give to the poor. Take up your cross and follow me." Amen. That was to me an easier request than what he just told Peter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. I want you to feed my sheep. No matter, you don't have any idea how to do it. It's a dangerous situation, but feed my lambs. Feed my sheep. And you're going to give your life for it. You're going to be crucified. Now, follow me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God that Peter made the right choice. Peter loved the Lord. He truly loved the Lord. How do we know he loved the Lord? Because he fed HIS SHEEP. HE TOOK THE GOSPEL. AMEN. HE TOOK THE KEYS OF THE GOSPEL to the three people types of the world. to the Jews, to the Samaritans, to the Gentiles, and he opened it to them in the face of GREAT DANGER. AND HE SACRIFICED HIS WHOLE LIFE TO DO IT. AND HE DIED BY CRUCIFIXION upside down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT? THAT WAS PETER'S LOVE FOR THE LORD. AMEN. THERE WAS NO QUESTION WHETHER GOD LOVED HIM OR NOT. JESUS WASN'T SAYING, "DO you think I love you, Peter? Are you sure I love you? Do you have any questions about my love for you?" THAT WAS UNQUESTIONABLE. THE QUESTION WAS, "PETER, DO YOU LOVE ME? ARE YOU WILLING TO KEEP MY COMMANDMENT? ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF? ARE YOU WILLING TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE? ARE YOU WILLING TO DO WHAT I ASK AND GO FEED my sheep? &gt;&gt; Even if it cost you your life. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that Peter followed him. &gt;&gt; We're here today because Peter followed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 20. Then Peter turned about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said, "Lord, which is he that betrayeth you?" We know this is John. Peter's seeing him say saith to Jesus, "Lord, and what shall this man do?" Listen, Peter is [laughter] Peter just got a pretty difficult commandment. And he looks around, he looks at John, and John's always been the favorite. What What has he got to do? Jesus saith to him, "If I will that he tar till I come." What is that to thee? Follow thou me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What if he gets nothing but blessings? What if his life is easy? What if he tries till I come? What does that have to do with you? I asked you if you love me. &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with any other human being. This has to do with just you and I, Peter. I'm asking if you love me. It has my love, MY RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY relationship with you. &gt;&gt; WHAT IF I GIVE HIM NOTHING BUT BLESSINGS and he tries? till I come and his life is easy and there's no crucifixion. AND WE KNOW JOHN'S LIFE WASN'T EASY. God was going to require of him imprisonment ON PATMAS &gt;&gt; BOILING ALIVE IN oil and the oil couldn't burn him persecution and imprisonment and all kinds of hardship IN HIS LIFE. BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER. AMEN. Jesus was asking Peter, "Do you love me regardless of what I do for anybody ELSE OR REQUIRE OF ANYBODY ELSE? CAN I REQUIRE more of you than anybody else? And do you love me enough to give it to me? Amen. &gt;&gt; WHAT IF EVERYBODY ELSE HAS AN EASY LIFE, BUT GOD ASKED YOU TO HAVE A HARD LIFE? WHAT are you going to do? &gt;&gt; WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO SACRIFICE? WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO EXPERIENCE LONELINESS? WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO EXPERIENCE LOSS in your family and keep believing and keep serving? WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR JOB? WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO MOVE AWAY? WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO KEEP believing when your family doesn't believe? WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO STAND true when YOUR SPOUSE LEAVES, BUT NOBODY ELSE HAS TO? Their spouse CAN STAY. ALL THEIR children can believe. They can have an easy life. What will you say? &gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER GOD LOVES YOU AND I OR NOT. THE QUESTION IS, DO WE LOVE HIM? &gt;&gt; GOD, help me to love you more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love him with all my heart. I got to slay this flesh of mine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To stay in his love. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Grace is what God did for me. Works is what I do for God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, they'll make a doctrine out of it. They'll think that works is what wins your merits. If it is, it isn't a free gift. Grace is what God did for you. By grace, you're saved. And works is what you do in appreciation of the grace that he showed to you. And if you love him, you like to do the works of the Lord. Certainly, because then you love him. Accepting me to as my wife was what love done for her. what she does in appreciation. She's a nice woman, stays home, takes care of the children, and lives a good, true life. That's not because we're not married. We are married, but she does that in appreciations. If she run downtown every day and took in every 10- cent store and up and down the streets and never washed the dishes or anything else, we are still married. Absolutely. When I took my vow, that settles it. She's my wife. As long as there's life in us, she's my wife. That's her vow. But what appreciation she does for that. She stays home and takes care of the children and tries to be a real wife. I could run out and be gone all the time just gatting about over the country and let her have starve or anything. Let the children go without something to eat. We're still married. If she even divorces me, I'm still married long as there's life in my body. I took that vow till death we separate. That's right. We're still married. But yet I make a poor excuse of a husband. She'd make a poor excuse as a wife. So if we love one another, we stick together and pull the load together. That's the way God in his church is when you're born in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't throw us away just because we're being a lousy wife. &gt;&gt; He made a promise. He made a commitment. He put our name on the book before the foundation of the world. Amen. Brother Ben said she'd be make a poor excuse as a wife. He'd make a poor excuse as a husband. We can be a poor excuse as the BRIDE OF CHRIST. HE'S STILL NOT casting us away. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HIS PROMISE. THAT'S HIS VOW. THAT'S HIS WORD. IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE a sorry excuse for a wife. I don't want TO BE A SORRY EXCUSE for his child. Amen. I WANT TO SHOW HIM THAT I LOVE him and I want to give him love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to abide in his love. I want to keep his commandments. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." Then I WANT TO SHOW HIM THAT I LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He asked Peter, "Do you love me?" Peter says, "Yes." Jesus didn't leave it with yes. &gt;&gt; He said, ' Then feed my sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Peter can show his love for Jesus by feeding his sheep. I don't want to just come and sing a song. Oh, I love you. I love you. I love you. And go out and live any way I want to live and be a sorry excuse for a bride. It's easy to sing the song, but I want to come and show him that I love him and I want to sacrifice for him. Not because I have to. Not because I have to or I'll be lost or I have to so I'll be saved. Because I want to because of all that he's done for me. I want to please him and I want to honor him and I want to show him my respect to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to keep his word. I want to obey the voice for this generation. I want to surrender to his will and to his word. I want him to know that I love him. And when Peter went out feeding his sheep, he knew he was doing what God had asked him to do. And he was showing his love for his savior. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:1-7 says, "Furthermore, we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us, how you ought to walk to please God, so you would abound more and more. For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication, that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor, not in the lust of concupitions, even as the Gentiles, which know not God, that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter, because that the Lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testify. For God hath not called us untoan uncleanness, but unto holiness. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has called us to holiness, friends. [snorts] &gt;&gt; God and when we look at holiness, Amen. I'm going to skip ahead here just a little bit and skip over something. But when we look at Leviticus 20, he says, "Sanctify yourselves to therefore and be you holy for I am the Lord your God." He's looking at his children. He says, "Be holy." And this word holy means sacred, holy, a holy one, a saint set apart. Listen, there's a part of holiness we cannot do for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have no holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "It's not the holy church. It's the holy God in the church." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the Holy Ghost in us. Amen. There's a certain holy We can't We have no holiness of our own. We cannot be holy. We cannot give ourselves holy. We cannot make ourselves holy. That's something God has to do. &gt;&gt; He has to do it by a sanctifying power of his blood. He washes us and frees us and sets us aside for service and fills us by his Holy Ghost and he makes us holy. But there is a part of holiness we can do. We can't make ourselves holy, but we can stay in holiness. I'll show you. See this word set apart. God will choose us. God will call us. God will fill us. And he'll set us apart. But he never takes away free moral agency. The question is, will we stay set apart &gt;&gt; or will we choose the world? &gt;&gt; We can stay in his holiness. Let's look at first Peter together. Let's read this scripture together. 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 13. 1 Peter 1 and13. Wherefore g up the loins of your mind and be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance. But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation. That word conversation means manner of life. He's he's telling us to be holy. We can't make ourselves holy. He has to make us holy. Brother B's clear on this. But he's telling us to be holy. That means stay separated and set apart and consecrated for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, my wife is holy unto me and I'm holy unto her. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I am completely set apart from every other female on this planet. only for her and she is completely set apart for me. She is holy unto me and I am holy unto her and I want to be holy unto the Lord &gt;&gt; and I want he's holy and he's told me TO BE HOLY NOT MAKE MYSELF holy he has to make myself holy but I can stay in holiness &gt;&gt; meaning separated unto him let's read that again verse 15 but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation manner of life because it is written and be holy for I am holy. Why do I need to be holy? Because he's holy. &gt;&gt; Because I'm a reflection of him. I'm here to reflect him on the earth. And he's holy. So he's called me to be holy. What is he? HE'S SET APART from anything filthy, from anything wicked, from anything that's of the devil, from anything that's contrary to the word. HE'S SET APART. And because I'm his reflection on the earth, he says because I'm holy, you be holy. You stay separated, too. because you're my reflection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we stay separated unto him. Be ye holy, for I am holy. And if you call on the Father, who without respect to persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojouring here in fear. For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold from your vain conversation, received by the tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in the last times for you. Why are we holy? Why are we set aside? Because we weren't redeemed with trivial things of silver and gold, but by the precious blood of Jesus Christ who purchased us. And he made us holy. And I want to stay separated for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to stay in a loving relationship with him. Hebrews 12:14 says, "Following peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord." This word holiness is this word that means consecrated. Consecration, purification, sanctification of heart and life. Listen, God has to make us pure. &gt;&gt; We can't make us pure, but it's the blood of Jesus Christ that makes us pure. We can't make ourselves pure, but once he's made us pure, we can stay in his purity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This word hagiosmos comes from a word 37 in the concordance. And if I pull up that word, Amen. This word uh it means to be holy, to render acknowledge or to be venerable or hallow. That's what God did when he chose us and he filled us with his spirit. He hallowed us. He made us holy. &gt;&gt; But then this one says to separate from profane profane things and dedicate to God to consecrate. That's what he's asking us to do when he says be you holy like I'm holy. He's asking us to separate from everything else and deb dedicated to God. &gt;&gt; So holiness is something God he makes us holy. We don't make ourselves holy, but we are commanded by the word to be holy and to walk in holiness. &gt;&gt; Holiness is a doctrine of the church. &gt;&gt; Holiness is the truth. Amen. Holiness is not legalism. Holiness is separation and consecration to God alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That this body, my life, my mind, my eyes, my mouth, my hands, they are separated for God only. They are rendered holy for his use only. Amen. They're not for the world. They're not for the things of the world. They're not for the things of the enemy. &gt;&gt; But I'm consecrated to God and I'm to be holy unto him. Why? Because I'm his wife. Because he loves me. &gt;&gt; Amen. When brother talked about his wife, he talked about me. Ma, you know, I've accepted her, chose her. We're bound by love till death do his part. So, she wasn't serving brother Brandham and serving the home because she had to to stay married. She was going to stay married anyways, but she wanted to out of appreciation, love, and respect for her husband. And he wanted to be a good husband to her because he loved her. And they were serving one another. I want to be a good wife to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In appreciation of all he's done for me. I don't want to serve myself. I want to serve him. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 John 3 1:3 says, "Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God." Friends, I'm going to stop right there. That statement alone should produce something inside of us. &gt;&gt; What manner of love the father's bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. What should that do to us? &gt;&gt; What should the revelation of that produce in us? What manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore, the world knoweth us not because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God. And it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are called to walk in holiness. We're called to be holy. We're called to love the Lord and keep his commandments. We're we're we're called to purify ourselves. We can't purify ourselves in the way Jesus purify ourselves. But we can stay separated from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I have to. No, we've already established that because I want to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because I'm trying to find favor. I've already found favor. I have I'm a recipient of his grace. &gt;&gt; Not so I can be redeemed. I'm already redeemed. I was redeemed before the foundation of the world. But oh, what gratitude should be in my heart. &gt;&gt; What appreciation for his love. What appreciation for his mercy. What love we should have together, him and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Corinthians 7:1, "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness and the fear of God." That perfecting means to bring to completion. This is what Paul's telling us to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a part that we can't do. God has to do it for us. But he there's a commandment for us to walk in holiness. There's a commandment for us to purify ourselves. There's a commandment for us to walk in sanctification. There's a commandment for us to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness and the fear of God. Why? Because we still have free moral agency. &gt;&gt; And we still get to choose. Listen, when brother Brandon went to work, Ma had free moral agency. &gt;&gt; She could choose what she would do with her day. He said she could run down to all the 10-centent stores. Well, he said, "I I something like that. Dollar Tree, &gt;&gt; Family Dollar, Dollar General, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; finding all the deals. Thrift store and blah blah blah blah blah." &gt;&gt; Or she could stay there in her post of duty and serve her husband and serve her children and make a home for him and make a nice meal for him and make it comfortable for when he comes home. Not because he's going to divorce her, but because she loves him and she appreciates him and she sanctifies herself to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; She makes herself holy unto him. Oh, that's the way I want to serve the Lord. I can run around. I can do some things. I can get away from with stuff. &gt;&gt; He loves me. He's not going to throw me away. I I by faith I believe that I'm one of his. He's not going to dump me in the trash can, friends. But his commandment is his love to me. &gt;&gt; And it's not grievious. Neither is it bondage. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The commandment he gives. Listen, when through a prophet in this age, he tells us about watching TV and Hollywood movies and he tells about the fashions of the world and he talks about smoking and drinking and all of these things. Listen, brother Ben's not coming and telling us, you know what, if you watch a movie, you're going to go to hell. He's telling us that's the trappings of Leodysia. That's bondage. The love of God will tell you, stay, keep your head out of them televisions. And he said, "Stay out of that Hollywood this and don't go to this and don't do that and don't be partakers of that." WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S THE LOVE OF GOD EXPRESSED TO YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; IF IT FEELS LIKE BONDAGE, WE NEED TO CHECK UP ON OURSELVES AND FIND OUT WHO GOD IS and who this messenger is and who the voice is and who's speaking to us in this age and what he's trying TO TELL US. SELL ALL YOU HAVE. GIVE TO THE POOR. TAKE UP YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME. THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE THAT MAN SAD. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE HAPPIEST THING HE EVER HEARD. YOU MEAN THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN DO? YOU MEAN I'M ALLOWED TO? YOU MEAN I CAN FOLLOW YOU? YOU MEAN YOU WANT ME? &gt;&gt; ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GIVE UP TEMPORAL THINGS AND NATURAL things and the THING THAT'S BINDING MY SOUL. AND IF I CAN GET RID OF THAT, YOU'RE INVITING ME TO FOLLOW YOU IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Easy choice, friends. &gt;&gt; THROW AWAY THE MONEY AS FAST AS YOU CAN. GIVE IT TO THE POOR AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND TAKE UP THAT cross and follow him. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET DIDN'T COME ALONG AND GOD HASN'T CAUSED HIM TO COME AND PREACH HARD MESSAGES UH CRYING OUT AGAINST SIN, CRYING OUT AGAINST THE FASHIONS OF THE WORLD and the way we dress. Listen, THOSE THINGS ARE BONDAGE. FASHION BRINGS SPIRITS, &gt;&gt; REAL SPIRITS, HOMOSEXUAL SPIRITS, LUSTFUL SPIRITS. AND if you're if you're surfing THE INTERNET, LOOKING ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR the latest fashion, the latest this, listen, YOU'RE OPENING YOURSELF UP TO SPIRITS, &gt;&gt; PLAYING AROUND WITH ENTERTAINMENTS, AND FINDING the latest this AND THE LATEST THAT. LISTEN, THE PROPHET TOLD US TO STAY AWAY FROM THOSE THINGS. WHY WAS IT BONDAGE? ABSOLUTELY NOT. IT'S FREEDOM, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Forget Hollywood. Forget the things of the world. forget what everybody else is saying and separate holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Look at this word and let it guide us &gt;&gt; like a marriage. Brother Brandham could go he could go to Shreport. His wife could stay home. [snorts] He's not worried about what she's going to do &gt;&gt; because he loves her. She loves him. &gt;&gt; She's not worried about being put away when he gets back if she didn't do a good job. She didn't measure up and she didn't get the house just right and the clothes just right and she didn't make sure the kids did all that they were supposed to do and she didn't get her checklist right and so she's nervous when brother Bam's coming home she's all upset worried I don't know if I'll be accepted she was already accepted &gt;&gt; she did that because she loved him &gt;&gt; that's the kind of relationship I want with the Lord &gt;&gt; you know in a home we can have a relationship that's based on all kinds of other things, but the relationship should be just between a man and a woman and that should be the primary relationship and everything else should be secondary. &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of emptiness syndrome? When couples divorce after they get an empty house, &gt;&gt; when the kids grow up and the kids move out, it's called emptiness nest syndrome. And they find out that when the kids move up and go to co go to college, get married and moved out and they're just there with each other. They find out that they have no relationship between the two of them. The basis for their love was a link between the children. And they both love the children. Because they love the children, it kept them bound. But when the children leave, they have no relationship. They have no love for one another. And although it looked like a good house and a good family and a good relationship and a good marriage, Amen. People are shocked sometimes that and the empty nest syndrome hits the most unlikely people. They look like a good family. They look like everything was going right. They look like they had it all together. &gt;&gt; But the basis for the relationship was not just the two of them. The basis for relationship was for the love for the children, the desire to raise them. &gt;&gt; Listen, that can happen to us in Christianity. It can get to the place where the basis of our relationship with God is through somebody else, &gt;&gt; through a spouse or through a church or through a preacher or through something else. And then we find out that when that preacher lets me down or when that church fails or when that spouse leaves or when something goes wrong, all of a sudden I'm in a crisis with faith of God. I have no relationship with God because my link to God was through the church. &gt;&gt; My link to God was through the preacher. The link to God was through a family member, through mom or dad or through my wife or through my husband. But I didn't have that relationship with him myself. Amen. And many times God will let something else get wrecked. He'll let somebody disappoint you. HE'LL LET THE CHURCH FAIL. He'll let your ministry fail. HE'LL LET YOUR SPOUSE FAIL. AMEN. SO THAT YOU HAVE TO COME back in contact with the relationship that matters. So you're NOT RELATED TO GOD AND LOVING GOD BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIS PEOPLE, because you love the ministry, because you love the preaching, BUT BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM. YOU AND HIM FIRST. YOU AND HIM ALWAYS. YOU AND HIM LAST. &gt;&gt; BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE, IT'S YOU AND HIM. AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE LEAVES, IT'S YOU and him. &gt;&gt; That's the way it should be with us and our spouses. Friends, we shouldn't put the kids first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It should be husband and wife first. You started together, you're going to finish together. The kids will come and the kids will go. You should stay in love with one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same thing WITH JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. I STARTED LOVING him because he reached out his hand to me. He redeemed ME OUT OF A PILE OF a mess. Amen. And he BROUGHT ME TO HIMSELF. AMEN. AND NO matter how many people I come in contact with and how much church members and friends and ministry and ALL KINDS OF STUFF. AMEN. I'M NOT GOING TO BASE MY relationship on HIM BY ANYBODY ELSE. BUT the one I started with is the one I'm going to walk with all THE WAY THROUGH. AND IT'S THE ONE I'M GOING TO FINISH WITH. CUZ WHEN I'm laying there taking my LAST BREATH, AMEN, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE CHURCH. IT'S not going to be anybody else. It's going to be me and God. AND WHEN I CROSS OVER, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HOLDING ANYBODY else's hand. It's going to be me and him. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP I WANT MORE than anything else. And I love him because he first loved me and his commandments are not grievious to me. If he through a prophet said, "STAY AWAY FROM THAT." MY HEART SAYS I WANT TO stay away from that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if there's SOMETHING IN THIS OLD COCKER BURNER NATURE OF ME THAT'S GETTING PULLED, AMEN, to Hollywood, TO MOVIES, TO FASHION THESE THINGS, I'M GOING TO SAY, GOD, AMEN, YOUR PROPHET TAUGHT US TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT. AND I believe that he was your voice FOR THAT DAY AND I DON'T WANT IT. GOD, COME AND TAKE THE DESIRE OUT OF ME BECAUSE I WANT NOTHING but you and I want to love you AND I WANT TO SHOW you that I love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE LIP SERVICE ON SUNDAY AND WEDNESDAY AND SING THE SONG AND GO AROUND AND VIOLATE ALL OF YOUR COMMANDMENTS THE REST OF THE WEEK and trample over everything you DESIRE OF ME. BUT I WANT TO LOVE YOU IN MY PRIVATE LIFE. I WANT TO LOVE YOU WHEN NOBODY'S LOOKING. I WANT TO LOVE YOU IN MY THOUGHT LIFE. I WANT TO LOVE YOU EVERY DAY, EVERYWHERE, UNDER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; CUZ IF YOU JUST LOVE HIM AT CHURCH AND YOU JUST LOVE HIM WITH you're with believers, BUT WHEN YOU GET OUTSIDE OF BELIEVERS, YOU CHANGE THE WAY YOU ACT. YOU CHANGE THE way you dress. YOU CHANGE the things you look at. You change the things you do, then your relationship to him is based on somebody else. &gt;&gt; But if you're all alone and nobody sees you, &gt;&gt; do you still do what he asks you to do in this agemen &gt;&gt; when it's just you and him? Do you still want to be holy? sanctified, purified to the word that's been given to us in this day. &gt;&gt; That word is our bridegroom, friends. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the thoughts of a man or the ideas of a man. That's our bridegroom speaking to us. &gt;&gt; All I want to do is love him. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want myself to be abased in him to be exalted. I want to sacrifice for him. If he said, "Feed my lambs," I want to feed the lambs. &gt;&gt; If he said, "Sell what you have good to the poor." I want to sell what I have. I truly with all my heart want to put him first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I find so many times that I've failed. And I find still so many days in which I still let some old desire creep up and trump what I know is right. And I find that I served myself and I didn't serve him. And I hate it every time I do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. In my relationship with my wife, I do the same thing. There's times I want to I want to put her first in everything. And I find myself I put my first myself first this time. And when it happens, I hate it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way it should be. We should hate ourselves for it. I hate that we did that, but I want to put myself first for him. &gt;&gt; Not that we've reached perfection, but oh, we're striving. &gt;&gt; Yes. that that holiness will be perfected or completed in me &gt;&gt; when I'm wholly completely set aside for him. &gt;&gt; When this vessel, doesn't that sound like the second fold of the three-fold purpose? &gt;&gt; Preeminence &gt;&gt; and a people. &gt;&gt; When I can be wholly set aside for my Lord, &gt;&gt; that's my love to [snorts] him. And you know what's so beautiful and so powerful is I don't have to do it. &gt;&gt; I don't have to do it to be saved. I don't have to do it to be born again. I don't have to do it &gt;&gt; to be in the lamb's book of life. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But something in me is responding to his love. &gt;&gt; And I have to do it. Not because I must in order to get something. But something in me is responding to his love. &gt;&gt; Something in me is reaching back to his love [clears throat and cough] and saying the commandment's not grievious. Holiness is not a scary word to me. &gt;&gt; Holiness is beautiful. &gt;&gt; It's me being set apart for him. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to do. Let's stand together. Musicians, if you'll come. Brother Josiah, if you'd please make your way up. Listen, I feel like I've fall short a thousand times. But you know what? I've fallen short at home before. Has any of you fallen short to your spouse? &gt;&gt; You can raise your hand. It's okay. I got both up because I've done it probably twice today. I don't know. &gt;&gt; But you don't give up. You don't throw in the towel. You don't say, "Well, it just ain't working. Amen. &gt;&gt; No, you wake up the next morning and start serving your spouse again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you got to repent, you repent. If you got to make it right, you make it right. But you go right back. What compels you to keep coming back in repentance? To keep coming back and serving, to keep surrendering your own ideas and keep doing what the other prefers. What is that? &gt;&gt; That's love. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not that you have to. They're not going to leave. They're not going to move out. You're not going to lose everything. &gt;&gt; No. But I keep I keep wanting to save the last piece of the pie for my wife. I keep wanting to make sure we find out what she wants to do, not what I want to do. And what what's better for her, not better. What is that? Does that have to? And she wants to make sure that he gets to go first and then he gets the best of this. And what is that? That's love, friends. &gt;&gt; Not because we have to, because we want to. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God's asked me to serve him, feed his sheep, live for him, surrender my life to him, stay away from the world, separate only unto him. Oh my goodness, everything in me wants to do that. &gt;&gt; And when I fail, I'm miserable and I'll repent and I'll make it right. But he didn't throw me away and I'm not throwing him away and I'm not running away. I'm not going anywhere because I started with him. I'm staying with him. We're going to finish with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to rise up and say, "God, help me &gt;&gt; one more time." Amen. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord, with all my heart. I'm sorry for putting myself first. I'm sorry for rejecting your commandment. I'm sorry for ignoring what you said. But oh God, I love you and give me another chance. I want to prove my love to you. I want to keep the word. &gt;&gt; I want to obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good, friends. &gt;&gt; God is good. And I'm so thankful I'm still alive. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful I'm still here &gt;&gt; because I messed up. in so many ways and done so many things wrong, but I still want to do something for him. And if he gives me another day, it's another chance to show him that I love him. &gt;&gt; When I get up and I talk to him first before I talk to anybody else, I'm showing him I love him. I mean, when I'm honest in my dealings through the day, when I do what he's asked me to do, when I when I turn my eyes from things I shouldn't see, when I surrender myself completely to him, I'm showing him that I love him. &gt;&gt; And oh, I thank God I'm still alive. And every day I'm alive, I want to show him that I love him more than anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together and pray. Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful, Lord, that you have called us in this hour. And God, you've not left us in darkness about what your desire is. God, it's not a mystery to us what you want from your bride in this end time. For God, you sent a voice in this hour and you laid it out. You told us what you like. You told us what you don't like. You showed us your preferences. You told us what to stay away from. You've told us the things to look at and the things not to look at. You've showed us your word. You've unveiled yourself to us. You've revealed your great mystery plan to us. You've showed us our part in it. And God, we love you so much. God, I feel like Peter sometimes, Lord, you know that I love you. But God, you gave him a chance to show it, to demonstrate it, to sacrifice himself, to feed your sheep. And God, you have given us your word in this generation like no generation has ever had it. You've placed it in our ears and in our hands and in our heart. We know what you want done. The bride knows what you want done with the word. You want it to be observed, obeyed, followed. And God, we stand like Peter. We failed you. We've messed up. We're grieved because you're asking us, "Do we love you?" But oh, the best thing you ever did for him was give him a commandment to say, "If you love me, feed my sheep." &gt;&gt; God, we love you. And we find that we've messed up so many times, but we stand in such a beautiful place because you have given us your word in this generation and you've asked us to live it. And oh God, I can go tomorrow and I can live it. Lord, if you'll give me your your strength and your anointing and your power, God, I'll exercise whatever choice I can to choose your word over myself. And I'm going to demonstrate how much I love you, Lord, because I get to I get the chance in this wicked world, in this Satan's Ed, in this blackness of darkness. You've allowed me to shine the light of your word by taking your word and putting it on. God, what a privilege we have. We love you. We want to walk in your word. Help us, Lord, to walk, Lord, like we've never walked before. Help us to forsake all the things of the world in ourselves and just to love you with all of our hearts, Lord. But I pray you bless your people as we go from here. May we go, Lord, walking with a clear vision, love in our hearts, with the opportunity to put our love into action. God bless us along the way. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. All [singing] to Jesus I surrender [music] all to [singing] him I freely [music] give. I will ever love [music] and trust in [singing] him.
