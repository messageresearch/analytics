[0:00] the devil hands us negative thoughts
[0:02] about the way somebody treated us or
[0:03] away a situation unfolded or a way
[0:05] somebody handled something amen and we
[0:07] begin to stick these things here and
[0:09] accomplish the next thing though we're
[0:10] walled off
[0:14] and we think the problems with everybody
[0:16] else
[0:17] that church that Ministry that family
[0:20] that family member that
[0:23] but they're not the ones who built the
[0:25] wall
[0:26] we are
[0:30] we sit inside our wall all bricked in
[0:33] and separated from fellowship and and
[0:35] licking our wounds and sucking our sores
[0:37] and blaming everybody else for this wall
[0:40] That's separating us
[0:46] and we think we're right
[0:52] say God forgive me
[0:55] amen knock down this wall that I built
[0:58] this thing that's separating me from
[0:59] fellowship this thing that's hurting me
[1:01] and we're the ones who hurt the most
[1:06] we suffer by our own efforts to save
[1:08] ourselves we destroy ourselves
[1:11] our own efforts to protect our heart
[1:13] from many more damage is the very thing
[1:14] that destroys our heart because we pull
[1:16] away from the fellowship that God wants
[1:18] to use to heal us
[1:21] I say God help me
[1:24] forgive me
[1:25] amen knock These Bricks out of the way
[1:28] all these negative lies of the devil all
[1:31] the wrong seed that was sown in my mind
[1:33] and I allowed it to stay God forgive me
[1:35] of that and knock it all away and help
[1:37] me to have a softer feeling in my heart
[1:39] towards others
[1:42] this is what he says
[1:44] I will repeat that last phrase until I
[1:47] feel different in my heart about it no
[1:48] matter if God did tell me but that is
[1:50] the change brother Roy that scene coming
[1:53] something's got to change me
[1:56] because I in my heart if I go out there
[1:58] feeling the way I do now I still feel
[2:01] that they ought to have heard the
[2:02] message they ought to have done it and I
[2:04] don't have the feeling for the people
[2:06] that I should have until I get that
[2:08] feeling there is no need in me going
[2:10] because I'd be a hypocrite
[2:13] my goodness brother Branham when he's
[2:16] coming with a perfect interpretation of
[2:18] the word a perfect Revelation and
[2:20] brother Branham at this point had
[2:21] Revelation he hadn't even shared yet he
[2:24] had things God told him he felt to stop
[2:25] not say anymore he understood what the
[2:28] third pull was he knew what the seventh
[2:31] seal was he knew what all the seals were
[2:33] he knew the day and hour he knew all of
[2:35] this he had this great Revelation and
[2:37] what he needed was not was not more
[2:39] Revelation what he needed was for him to
[2:41] change so that he can Manifest this
[2:42] revelation
[2:44] so he can move into this final stage of
[2:46] the ministry he was going to take a
[2:47] change in him and the change in him was
[2:49] not going to be Pride it wasn't going to
[2:51] be arrogancy it was going to be a
[2:52] haughty Spirit it wasn't going to be a
[2:54] know-it-all the change in him was going
[2:56] to be a greater feeling for the people
[2:57] he was moving into the Capstone of
[2:59] perfect love that's the change that he
[3:01] needed
[3:04] and what change do we need we don't need
[3:06] to have the answers for everything we
[3:07] don't need to cut everybody's legs out
[3:09] from under them when they don't
[3:10] understand the message or they disagree
[3:12] we don't need debate we don't need all
[3:14] of this nonsense what we need is a more
[3:16] Divine love perfect love working in us
[3:18] we need something to change us
[3:21] so that we can move into this final
[3:23] stage of the ministry
[3:25] it's not going to be head and knowledge
[3:27] that does it is not going to be we
[3:29] understand it all and nobody can stand
[3:31] against the Bible Understanding that we
[3:33] have my goodness
[3:34] what we need is to project love
[3:39] because when love projects Sovereign
[3:41] Grace takes its place
