TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and abel now is attracted to the sheep amen and you see that god had made garments for his children but you think about the boys as they come out amen they become infants and and now amen we know that clothing had originated and they start to wear clothes and and they start to grow up and now you wonder uh cane what what would adam and eve have made their garments out of they already tried the vegetation and that was curved that didn't work so so this is just brother chad but i would think that they would repeat what god did [Applause] and adam knew what the covering was and he would cover his boys one was his one was just living in the house and so abel abel year after year he was experiencing this covering amen and mom and dad have to be covered and all of a sudden it's important that we're covered and it's necessary that a lamb is covering us and and all of a sudden abel i mean there's something attractive in this to abel and abel's attracted to the sheep he's not attracted to the cursed ground he's not looking to build a bigger kingdom he's not looking to gain or possess he's not all he's doing is taking care of what god has provided for his covering he may not understand it all yet but he's experiencing it he's covered in it it's covering for him amen is his dad sees that it's important that you're covered in this lamb and now he's going to take care of the thing that's covering him the thing he's interested is the thing that's covering him because we're clothed in the word amen the spotless word and the righteous word of god and now the able nature amen is a shepherd nature who's caring for the very thing that's covering him the the the thing that covers him was the lamb so now he's going to take care of the lamb because the thing that covers us and washes us and purifies us and removes sin from us is the blood of the lamb it's the lamb it's the life of the lamb it's the word of the lamb the lamb is the word and now we become shepherds of the word we love the word amen not the cursed world not the cursed earth but we love this thing that's covering us we love this thing that is a substitute for me the thing that covered for me paid my price covered my sin is the thing that i'm going to give all my life to and i'm not going to change it manipulate it force it all i'm going to do is care for it
