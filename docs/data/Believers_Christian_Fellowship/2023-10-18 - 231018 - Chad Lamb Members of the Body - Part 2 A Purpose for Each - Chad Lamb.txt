Comfort God will move God will help let's just bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord that no matter what we face in life we have a strong tower that the righteous run into and they are safe Lord you are everything Lord you are our strength you're our comfort Lord You're our joy you're our comforter when we mourn and God we just want to lift up Lord the family of sister

Lord but I pray you'd care for him and for his family at this time God as we take this time and set it aside to look into your word Lord I pray you would take your word and that you would shape us Lord that you would carve us Lord into the very predestinated image you had of us before the foundation of the world that you would take your word and shape us into what you envisioned Lord not what we've envisioned but what you envision what your purpose is for us being here I pray God that you would take my lips and that you would use them for your purpose and For Your Glory as I Surrender myself to you Lord may you come and Minister through the gift you placed in this vessel and bless your children Lord Feed Us Lord by your own hand we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and while we're standing let's take our bibles if we could together and turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we're going to continue on from last Wednesday's service we we preached on members of the body the purpose of the fivefold ministry and now we're going to take part two members of the body a purpose for each and so I really I was going to cram a whole bunch into today like I typically do and I just made myself stop amen today while I was meditating and praying I said you know what we're not going to cram it all in this Wednesday night we're going to take our time we're going to have a good oldfashioned Bible study amen so I I I I tend to bite off more than I can Che but we ask God to just direct us now but let's look at 1 Corinthians chap 12 verse 27 says now ye are the body of Christ and me members in particular may may God bless us as we look at his word as you're seated amen I want to say I appreciate it the Special appreciate the Abbott family for for doing that appreciate brother John for helping them get out of their comfort zone everybody has to do their part amen uh I want to say too that brother Danny dundo left this morning he had to extend his trip by a little bit so we drove him down to the airport this morning he got on a plane and headed down to Charlotte he's got a few stops to make he'll be preaching for brother Homer Longoria this weekend then he'll be flying out a week from today so just remember him in his travels and as he goes back home and I just want to say how much I appreciated that service loose for the Master's use amen and I appreciate how it tied in with Wednesday and and hopefully we can build off of that by the grace of God and we just love to see the continuity of the spirit and how encouraging that was that we've been loosed for a purpose amen we've been loosed for the Master's use and mean we know that God redeemed us we know that God saved us we know in this generation he he opened up the mystery that was in his mind so that we could see amen who we really are amen that he took away the veil that had been even over the seven Church ages so that we can finally see further than they've ever been able to see all the way back to the hidden Mystery that was in the back part of God's mind amen and God had such a display in this generation and and in this age to show us and to vindicate amen the ministry of brother brandham but then we come down to it and it's all going to be why what for what was the purpose what did God want to do amen it all has to do with something about us here today God wants to show himself through a many membered body he wants to express himself and reflect himself on the earth through the body amen so we want to find each of us our place in that body and that's what we want to spend time on this evening and the me and the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother B says and his church stands alone she is is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last day and she and she alone stands by it amen she is his body which is what the manifested truth of his promised word for the last day this is the day we live in amen this is the purpose amen the message come to unveil this and then in the message Christ again Christ is revealed in his own word he says and he's govern the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam's was rather at the beginning amen so what's it come down to it's come down to the complete body of Jesus Christ amen revealed in the form of a bride amen that's the part you and I are fleshing out in this day amen amen amen and that's we want to be faithful to them if we can go back to Ephesians chapter 4 we'll come back to 1 Corinthians 12 but let's go to Ephesians uh 4 and I want to review this from last time last time we talked about the purpose of the fful ministry and we start off by saying we we have had such a defense of the fful ministry uh in the end time because it's come under attack and so we're very familiar with the fact that God has a fful Ministry that that God has a purpose for the fful ministry that they are the the dress Weare of Christ the inside dress of Christ and we know that that's the ministry of Christ through those five offices and and we believe all that but we wanted to look at what is the fivefold ministry for what's the purpose of the fful ministry so when we look at this let's go to verse 11 and say and read here chapter 4: 11 of Ephesians and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for this is where we get into the purpose for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ amen so we find out that the fful ministry is for the perfecting or the this word perfecting means equipping for the equipping of the Saints so the fivefold ministry is supposed to equip the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying or building up of the body of Christ a amen so we find that the fful ministry is here Amen to equip the Saints and to build up the body right amen verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man this word perfect now means a full age complete amen or mature until we come into a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the light of men and the cunning craftiness but whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him and all things which is the head even Christ from whom from the head from Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and love amen we come down to verse 16 and and as we mentioned last time 16 becomes the conclusion of the matter what was the fivefold ministry given for amen it lists all these things for the perfecting of the Saints the work of the ministry edifying of the body of Christ until we all come into the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect or fully mature man to the stature of a perfect man amen but when we get down to verse 16 says who the whole body now we're talking about the body again fitly that means tightly joined together and compacted that means knit together or coales compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen all of a sudden we realized the fold Ministry was here to get each of us to do our job for the equip us to to to build up the body to keep us from being tossed about by every wind of Doctrine but that we speak the truth in love and that we would be edified till we become till every joint fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint every connection supplieth and to the measure of every part amen can you say every part part okay who is every part raise your hand amen this is every part now the scripture is talking about me amen the purpose of the fful ministry is to get to where every joint suppli till every part to the measure of every part making increase of the body or building the body unto the edifying of itself in love then all of a sudden we realize that now we are all responsible for the building of the body of Christ to the edifying of the body of Christ building itself together in love now the responsibility is shifted it's not just the five offices that are responsible for making the whole body it's every joint every member every part so now we all have one goal one purpose one thing that we're working on and we're all working to build the body of Jesus Christ on Earth to manifest and display him in Bride form amen and we're not here to do to be a solo act amen I'm not here to do it all on my own and be everything myself amen because we're here to coales to cohese to knit together to be every joint that's Supply it amen to be every part the measure of every part amen building itself amen so we we learn that the fful ministry is not here to become celebrities to become showman amen the fful ministry is here to perfect the Saints to equip the Saints to build up the body to give the tools to give the correct teaching to speak the truth in love amen so that every member can take their place and every member can work towards one goal and and that's building the body of Christ now every single one of us are responsible to build the body of Jesus Christ we can't just sit idly by and say well they'll do it the ministry will do it and this one will do it and the officers of the church will do it that's not what the scripture is telling us amen the purpose of the fivefold ministry was to get me to do it to equip me to empower me Amen to to to bring me into maturity so that I can do that Amen in my measure and in my part amen praise God so so that's that's what we spoke about last time praise God now I want to go back into the gifts because I touched on it but we Bree through it but I don't want to Breeze through it I want to spend a little bit of time so if you'll turn with me uh to um let's go to uh 1 Corinthians chapter 12 actually I'm sorry I'm sorry go back to Ephesians we'll come back to this but I wanted to do like I did last time and pick up the beginning part of Ephesians so we can set the context and as we're going there I want to read this quote from 1957 when he says and then Jesus came so but God has set in the church five different gifts Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors those are for the perfecting of the church that is his proof his ministering spirits to the church to bring the body of Christ together so what's the purpose to bring the body of Christ together now we read from Ephesians 11 on to 16 but let's go back amen and set the context before we read this in verse one chapter 4:1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body one SP and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ amen wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men so all of a sudden the precursor to what we just read if we back up amen Paul is telling us let us with all loneliness and meekness forebear one another let's work together and with to one another in love amen endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace for there's one body one what's he doing he's showing Unity he's showing Oneness he's showing what the body should be and what we all should be endeavoring to be amen we should all be laboring and working and endeavoring amen for one body amen and that that works in a local body but it's the global Body of Christ too we should be endeavoring to keep the unity and the bond of Peace amen amen amen we should be working for that amen laboring for that not just waiting until somehow it magically happens but but we should be endeavoring to do that amen and he shows that there's a Unity there's one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who's above all through all and in you all but unto every one of us now we come to the members in particular but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity and gave gifts unto men so now each of us have a deposit there's a Unity there's a one body but each member has a deposit a deposit of the gift of Grace yeah now what are we supposed to do with that amen that's the question we've been all given amen a deposit of the gift of Grace what should we do with it keep it to ourselves be happy that we got it or is this is this deposit for me nope it's for the body amen that's why it's been given to me amen we're going to see that as we go on let's jump over now to First Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and brother Frank if you could pull up the Whiteboard I'm going to use the whiteboards again tonight in in verse 12 or chapter 12:4 now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but is the same God which worketh all and in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so the manifestation of spirit is given to each one what's it given to each one for to profit everybody amen this isn't just for me this is for everybody now when we look at verse four it says there's diversity of gifts then verse 5 difference of administrations then verse six diversity of operations this word diversity difference and divers ities is all the same Greek word and this Greek word if we go to the dictionary to the um strong concordance it says a distinction arising from a different distribution to different persons so what's he saying there's a distribution given different distributions to different per persons it means it's not all the same let's just put in Layman Stern it's not cookie cutter it's not Stamped Out in like a production line you get this you get this you get this but it's diverse amen it's it's a different distribution to different purp persons so there's a there there is let's go back and say there's a diversity of gifts there's differences of administration and there's diversity of operations amen amen so if we could look at at this word administrations it means service or the way it's ministered ministered to others so there's a diversity or differences or a different distribution to different per persons of the gifts but it's one Spirit there's differences of ministry the way that it's ministered way that it serves the body is different and there's diversity of operations this word operations means working or the way it works or the effect that it has so this means you can have one gift called evangelist and that evangelist you can have 10 different evangelists and they can can all operate differently it can all be ministered differently it can operated differently they're not cookie cutter it's not the same you can say it's the same office amen but it operates differently the same way with pastors you can say there's a pastor and when you say Pastor you may get in your mind an image of what a pastor should be amen but don't forget there's differences of administration and there's diversities of operations amen it's not all Cookie Cutter the same and I've had people tell me before amen they said I don't believe that man's called to be a pastor he's really an evangelist or he's really this and I'm saying God placed him over that church that church voted him in as a pastor how can you and your arrogance say that what God has allowed is wrong it's because your own preconceived idea I believe a pastor should be this I believe an evangelist should be this I believe this amen that's wrong amen what God places God places these are elect offices predestinated by almighty God and he knows who to fill each office with and we need to get our own thinking out of the way and let God Express himself the any way that God wants to express himself and quit quit using our own carnal our own history our own Traditions to say well he's a pastor he's not a pastor Hey listen if God called him to be a pastor and that local congregation voted him in place that's the voice of the Holy Ghost in that place he's a pastor and if he's been a pastor for 30 some years how are you going to come along and say he's not really Pastor he's really an evangelist m goodness what an arrogant spirit amen what I mean those people are happy they're growing under that Ministry why would we say something like that right I'll tell you why we'd say something like that because we're too proud and too amen but we need to realize that the spirit divideth severly as he willth amen there are diversities of gifts and differences in operation and differences in administration amen this should help all of us because I don't have to be like anybody else you don't have to be like anybody else the moment we can relax and just be what God gave us to be we're going to be the best help we can ever be to the body amen amen but as soon as we start getting uncomfortable and trying to match something else or somebody's idea of what we should be all of a sudden we're going to be hindering the moving of the spirit in our Liv amen because God worked a long time to get you fashioned a certain way brother Brenham said he bred this one to this one and this one to this one to get the Chim to have a certain tting and we think I need to be like this brother over here and God's been working for generations to get you a certain way so that he can get a certain ring out of our lives and we think because of this idea or this traditional teaching or because I was told this by somebody that listen we need to learn to relax and say God you called me amen you filled me with your spirit I'm born again by your spirit there's a purpose that I'm here and I need to relax amen amen what did Brother Bram say was the key to operating any gift to relax amen and I tell you it's the hardest thing to do brother B said in the voice of the sign he said Moses no one else could take his place no one else could do the job he was ordained to do it I love this God knew Moses would be the one Moses was born under a sign Moses was predestinated to take that position Moses tried in his own strength and he failed and he ran out into the Wilderness and for 40 years Amen brother B said God was beating Moses out of Moses amen so when God comes back to call Moses back to the commission back to what he formed him for back to why he was born amen Moses had gotten so humbled by his failure and so beat down with a hot-tempered wife on the back side of a desert that when God comes to Moses Moses I'm calling he says I can't do it Moses they won't listen to me Moses but I'm I'm I'm slow of speech until God became angry with Moses because Moses was I can't do it they won't hear me I don't send somebody else Moses is all worked up and and you and I you and I Amen in our human thinking we think well just forget about Moses go find someone else there's no plan B there's nobody else Moses was predestinated to have that position God cannot do away with him there's a predestined ated seed that before the foundation of the world when God said amen when God knew in his mind there would be a deliverer and that he would bring him out with a mighty hand he foresaw Moses when he said a virgin shall conceive he foresaw Mary there's not another option there's no plan be right so that's why he talks to Moses and Moses resist and mo he asked him again Moses resist and there's this dialogue back and forth until God is getting angry with Moses and I would be like forget it get somebody else that send out applications there's got to be somebody that can do this there was nobody God had to keep working with Moses until Moses went because Moses was the only one what does that say about you and I that God can just get another one not if I was the one he foresaw before the foundation of the world there's no plan B right there just NE there's just you amen we've got to take our place no one else could take his place no one else could do the job he was ordained to do it and brother and sister if you've got eternal life you were ordained to do a certain thing and listen closely what the prophet says do you believe you've got eternal life by the grace of God the faith in your heart says I I have eternal life then you were ordained to do a certain thing you're you're not just here to be here right maybe a good housewife look at what he says maybe a good housewife maybe something else but nobody can take your place God has made you a place don't try to take somebody else's place that's carnal impersonations see shows there is something wrong with you be what you are just exactly don't be nothing else amen thank God every time I tried to be something else I failed and embarrass I embarrassed myself being me but anyways at least it's at least it's honest and true again in the voice of the son he says when God has called a person for a job to do there is no one can take its place there is no one can take your place your peculiarity and all of us can say Amen about everybody else everybody's got peculiar arities there's individual I mean we know it am mean we don't have to go around the room and ask people to stand up and give description we all know that we all have peculiarities there's a uniqueness to each one of us like our fingerprint amen there's no two that are exactly like you'll find some people that similar but no two are exactly like why did God do it that way amen because he's got a certain thing for you and I to do amen he said how often I wondered how I would like to take oral Robert's Place how I would like to take Billy Graham's place somebody like that like Billy Graham go speak to an audience of people call Sinners to the altar forget it and go home and not have to stand there and wrestle again I cannot be Billy Graham but neither can Billy Graham be me I cannot be or Roberts or Roberts cannot be me you're each one set in God's economy just for its place one fast all the time and communes with God while another one cast out Devils because this one is fasting amen but it's the whole body of Christ working together the unity the whole body of Christ working together one will Fast and pray the other one will cast out Devils because the one fasting and praying is helping the one that's casting out devils and the whole body is working together in unity that's why we can't all do the same thing we all have to fill a role amen let's go uh back to uh chapter 12 here 1 Corinthians 12 and verse 8 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these work at that one and self-same spirit dividing to every man severly as he will I want to write these down so you can have them and you can write them down with me I want to write down these gifts that we just read about wisdom knowledge Faith healing Miracles prophecy Discerning of spirits tongues and interpretation of tongues all right brother brandham calls these the the nine gifts of the Spirit he takes out of 1 Corinthians 12 and he often calls them the nine spiritual gifts said all these gifts are in the body and they're always to be in the body and they're there to keep the church clean man I want to write them down because because many times when we look at the gifts of the Spirit amen when we talk about gifts of the Spirit often times we just think of a couple of them we think of the ones that are maybe more dynamic or they're more prevalent but if you look at them wisdom is a gift of the spirit wisdom is the use and placing of knowledge and understanding knowledge amen that's that word in in uh in the Greek means science Amen brother BR said it's Holy Ghost knowledge amen an understanding of God and the things of God wisdom knowledge Faith healing Miracles prophecy Discerning of spirits tongues and interpretation of tongues amen so I wanted to write them down so we can see these are all gifts of the Spirit amen and God has placed them in the body amen I set at the vantage point where I I told you before where I get to know that there's these gifts in the body amen because I know I know who prays in tongues I may not know everybody but I know several who pray in tongues I know Gifts of inter prayer that are in the body amen I know that we have a sister here who God will wake up in the middle of the night amen with a burden on her heart she'll go to pray and break into tongues and praying until it releases those gifts are in the body brother Bram said they're in the body they remain in the body they need to be in the body and they're here to keep the body clean to keep the church clean so those gifts are here but we all don't seek the same gift we all don't want the same gift we're all not after Chasing After the same thing we're here to be we're here to to receive what God has given us amen and to express what God has given us amen sometimes it's easy to know if you have to give a tongues but do you how do you know if you have the gift of wisdom you see what I'm saying or the gift of knowledge or the gift of faith Every Man's been given a Measure of Faith amen that's his faith to believe but this is something different this is a gift of faith there's some people that just have that gift of bulldog faith and when they really go to seek something from from God they get answers amen healing Miracles prophecy amen some of these things are already working in our life and other people recognize it in us and we may fail to recognize it ourself but these gifts are here we're going to go into some others as well as we move on we're not going to stop there but let's keep reading let's keep reading for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ amen Christ is now expressed in a many membered body for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not of the not I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath God set in set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him you got that amen you say I want to be this or that no he has set you in the body as it pleased him amen amen as it has pleased him verse 19 and if there were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and uncomely Parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely Parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked that there should be no Schism division no Schism in the body amen but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all members suffer with it or one member be honored all members Rejoice with it now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular amen what what's Paul telling us the Apostle Paul is taking our natural bodies that we have and he's typing it to the body of Christ to the spiritual body and he's showing you have many members and there's different operations and there's diversity of operations and and they operate differently but you can't do without any Amen in fact you you put more abundant Honor on the part that's lacking if you were missing a part amen all of a sudden you would realize how bad that you needed it amen I mean you think there's there's so many of us here tonight there's probably 150 to 200 of us here tonight amen but brother emanuel's not here and how many you notice brother emanuel's not here there's a part that's lacking and we notice it amen how many are encouraged when you hear Brother emanuel's big amen amen so you can see when the part's lacking then all of a sudden like a I wish brother Emanuel was here that goes for each one of us we all have something to contribute something to do amen amen we think oh there's so many of us we won't notice if I'm gone amen somebody will notice if you're gone in fact if half of us were gone how discouraged would the other half be you'd come to church you'd be discouraged where's everybody at why aren't they here you don't realize that sometimes our very presence is making a difference creating an atmosphere bringing the bringing the right atmosphere maybe not just for myself maybe to help the person next to me but my very presence can change everything amen that I'm not just showing up to be there I'm not just a tagalong I'm not an extra part there are no extra parts there are no tagalong and there are no free riters everybody's contributing right and when we envision ourselves as contributing we won't we won't any longer just come along and Slough down and sit there and hope something happens that's not why you're here you're here to make something happen you're here to edify the body to build it up you're here to be a joint that supplies you're not here to see if something will happen you're here to make something happen is that what the scripture tells us I hope something happens tonight I hope somebody I hope everybody else is pulling it's not the way it works amen oh I'm going to get back to this list but I I I want to do something else but I'm going to come back to our list I was thinking about our body after reading through uh 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and how every part and how we know that we're fearfully and wonderfully made and this is a a picture or a type of the body of Christ it's a many-membered body not everybody doing the same thing not everybody with the same role not everybody with the same function amen but we all got a part to play and I was thinking about I was just in my mind thinking about oh what's parts of the body that we take for granted you know what what this and that and the other and I was thinking what about my pinky toe is my little toe important and then I begin to realize when you think about it you it goes unnoticed you don't really pay much attention to it amen it's just a part that's there but if you're if you're in a in an activity or you're working or you're playing a sport and you take a hard step far to the right amen and you have to go quickly to the right and stop instantly amen if you didn't have a pinky to the one next to it to catch you there you could topple over you may not use it every step it may not be the most important part but there are times when you need it and when you need it you're glad it's there yeah and sometimes you don't even notice the function that it has yeah because it just happens that's the same thing true with all of us sometimes we don't even notice the function that each one's serving because it's just coming naturally It's Just Happening that's right I was thinking about skin nobody gets excited about skin but skin is the largest organ in your body the largest organ in your body is your skin and your Skin's made up of a ton of little cells compacted together and fitted together to make an impermeable water type barrier and that skin is protecting your entire body yeah detecting it from protecting from chemicals protecting it from abrasion protecting your capillaries and your blood vessels and and also holding in the moisture so you don't dehydrate instantly that skin is is doing something really important but we don't ever think about it unless we cut it you know and then when we cut it you got to watch for infection because that was the barrier to guard us against infection now can come in and so all of a sudden every part of it important you can't have a part just bail out one day and then all of a sudden all the water vapor leaving your body and infections coming in you understand it may go unnoticed it may not have a a grand title it may not do something that super important it may not be the part that pulls the trigger it may not be the part that speaks the word it may not be the part that sees amen but it's a part there that if it wasn't there there would be a gap and some something bad would happen amen amen so all of these things you know sometimes because we've lived in a society based on Pride we part putting statuses to things this role is more important in this office and and this is an important part and that's not an important part we got to get rid of that tell me which is not an important part in the body of Christ right tell me which part that God predestinated ordained to be here is not needed or not necessary are not as important as another part we got to get that thinking clear out of our minds and that's the part that has us come and sit in our seats and do nothing amen because we think I don't have a title I don't have an office nobody's asked me to do nothing Hey listen God's asked you to do something from before the foundation of the world he placed you there for a reason amen you say what do I do I don't know just do what comes natural right amen I was going to I was going to take a look at one other part just to drive the drive the message home it was quite funny I was thinking about eyebrows some people care so much about the eyebrows and you know they pluck them and they do all kinds of funny stuff with them they're part of our face and you know I think ah they're not really people that overemphasize eyebrows you know it becomes a beauty thing and all that nonsense but I went to look at it and I said well yeah I can see they're important you know cuz the shape when you're sweating it takes the water whether it's raining or you're sweating and it moves the water to the outside and drops around your eyes so that you don't get that sweat in your eyes and when you're in strenuous activity and working or or running and and if it was getting your eyes it would blur your vision you could fall you could hurt yourself eyebrows are important right so I go looking at that yeah even eyebrows are important but then I I actually went and looked at it and I found out some part that we think would be insignificant has way more significance than I ever dreamed of and that's what stunned me that's why I wanted to uh draw this out cu it's just it's a funny little silly thing but I hope it gets the point gets the point home now you know how good I draw so you guys just have to forgive me why on Earth are you laughing all right these are three of my friends and these three friends of mine have no eyebrows but who cares CU eyebrows aren't important right why I mean if you want to keep sweat out of your eyes so you don't get blurred vision you don't run into a tree running from a grizzly bear but then when I actually went and looked at it it it struck me funny that eyebrows are way more important than I thought you get the point I thought it was of no value but most of our non-verbal communication comes through our eyebrows I didn't even realize this till I looked it up when you find somebody that you say is more expressive than the others usually they have more range of motion in their eyebrows and that person's super expressive it's because they can really get those eyebrows going and I didn't even realize that I've I've lived lived in this all my life and didn't even realize that that's the part that I was feeding on that's the part that was singly me that was part that was taking the words and I was matching the words with the expression to get the right understanding of the communication so much of what's being communicated is coming through the facial expression so we would say in communication the mouth is the most important part or this is the most important part but all of a sudden if you do away from the eyebrows you can have all kinds of misunderstandings and miscues amen and all goes together because the body is fashioned and knit together where every part is necessary amen and it works together so communication listen I never would have dreamed until yeah yesterday and today when I looked at it that communication that eyebrows are necessary for communication so then all of a sudden I want to take that silly little lesson and I want to bring it home and you may sit there and think you know what I do goes unnoticed I don't know that I have a part I I just come to church and I just do my thing you may not put value on it but not realize how much value is actually there amen because church is not just about coming and having a church service amen church is 24/7 church is not the building church is the body of Christ we are the church amen and we are interconnected and we're depending on one another and we're caring for one another we're encouraging one another we're admonishing one another we're provoking one another our whole spiritual growth is based on our connections to one another amen it's not just Sunday it's not just Wednesday it's not just during the preaching but we are absolutely intricately involved with one another and linked together and we are depending on each other for these links and so we've got to get the whole notion of well that's an important part and that's not an important part amen I didn't realize that eyebrows were an important part but now I know that eyebrows were an important part and we may not realize how just the simple fact of caring for one another is maybe the most important part heart of all amen the simple things amen the things that happen all the time that go unnoticed like when you communicate with somebody and watching their eyebrows move all your life and never notice that that was the part that was actually speaking to me amen there's Parts in this body that is making the body of Christ fit together and we may not even be able to put our finger on it amen but it's working together so we got to get past this notion of this is a that's a this is a p in the body that's an important part that's not an important parten let it all fade away and say God help me to take my part help me to take my part and I'll tell you when it comes down to it you say brother Chad what do you want us to do I mean more than anything what I want all of us to do is I want us all to surrender to the plan of God and be engaged and be connected and be knit together and serve one another in any capacity we have to serve and Love One Another Not Just just here but in the bride worldwide amen we each have a part to fill here for in a local assembly but I want as an assembly to fill a part in the global body of of Jesus Christ I want us Amen to be a joint that supplieth amen I want to be a member that gives to the measure of the edifying together of itself in love whether it's called important or not important it's all important whether we call it big or little it doesn't matter to me I just want to do my part 1 Corinthians chap 12 let's keep reading now verse 28 and God has set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all inter interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way what is the more excellent way he's going to get to that in Chapter 13 the more excellent way is the way of Love charity and it should override everything but I want to look he added two more positions in the body or or our parts in the body he added in this in verse 28 helps and governments so I want to add them to our list here helps in governments so helps I look this word up and helps means to Aid or support God has placed this in the body help he's placed in the body governments this governments means to steer it comes from the word of a captain of a ship to guide the ship so his governments is to steer or you could say to direct to direct God placed that in the body you know I'm hoping that our understanding can expand Beyond whatever our tradition is say you know what God has diversity of gifts diversity of administrations diversity of operations and God has placed in the body helps those to Aid or to support and governments those who will take charge of something and direct something God placed that in the body brother BM says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says don't never Clan among or talk and make yourself clannish we are are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're my not my right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open Yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to pray God wants us to stay right with one another connected as a body he says in the message three kind of Believers he said Joseph another believer he couldn't help being what he was he was a prophet you know Joseph didn't try to be a prophet brother bam didn't try to be a prophet they were born that way they didn't aspire to become that they weren't trying to be that and I'll tell you the same thing's true if you're in the fivefold ministry you're not trying to be a preacher amen that's a that's the elect office of God God chose that we're not trying to be this we're not trying to be that don't try to be anything amen just be what God made you to be and all of it will just start to come out amen amen he was a prophet God made him a prophet he didn't want to be different from his brothers but he was different God made him what he was nobody else could take his place nobody can take your place no matter how little you say I'm just a housewife nobody can take your place God in his great economy has set it so the body of Christ in order till there's no one can take your place how I would like to take Billy Grant's place any of us ministers but we can't do it but just remember Billy can't take our place so we all have a place some of us are are evangelist some prophets some teachers some pastors whatever we are some Housewives some mechanics some Farmers Whatever It Is God has set you in your place if God has set you in your place and set me in my place I don't think we should belittle our place I don't think we should ever belittle it on how much it's noticed or not noticed how much it's recognized or not recognized if God has set us in our place I don't think we should belittle that place I think we should give our whole Hearts to it Romans CH 12 let's turn there together I going to look at another portion of scripture and we'll start to wind it up with this here Romans chapter 12 verse 3 for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith our ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation abore that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another so I want to add a few more things that the Apostle Paul put in here amen out of Romans 12 and in Romans 12 he adds these things these positions in the body he adds Ministry now immediately when we look at the word ministry we often think pull pit Ministry but that's not necessarily what this means this word ministry means to minister to or to serve it comes from the same uh Bas Greek word as Deacon and the Deacon is the waiter on tables are those that serve the body amen so this word ministry is not necessarily pull pit Ministry it's actually serving and ministering to one another so many of us do that then he added this one exhortation or he that exhorteth I'll write it down this way exhorteth this word exhorteth is interesting it means to console or to encourage or to strengthen to console or to encourage or to strengthen he added a part in the body of giving or he that ruleth so there's ruling this word ruling means to set in order like a superintendent and then he added Mercy it's what Paul said I looked at Mercy we all have mercy we have mercy on one another another but this word mercy means to help The Afflicted and the Apostle Paul makes this also parts of the body man I hope that we can see there's a lot more to this than maybe our traditional teaching had us thinking that God is building a body and he set the members in the body to accomplish Lish many things and I said God I just want to accomplish the part you gave me to accomplish amen I want to be there to do what you've called me to do in the identified Masterpiece of God the prophet says he has a purpose in your life each individual that no one else on the face of the Earth can take your place God has got something for you you're made like that you was did that way for a purpose God is Sovereign in his work amen we different one from another we notice in the animal life we find out in the animal life there's one animal God made a beast of burden like the horse he has to work and a cows a sacrifice and the lion and the tiger roams the force without any labor or anything he made a great big animal like an elephant he made a little bitty fellow like a mouse now who is there to tell God what to do and how to do it he does it his own way and he makes the mountains he makes the deserts he makes the Seas he makes the plains he makes one kind of tree hardwood palm and so forth he does he makes men different he gives us each one a different place and a palm tree can never be a hickory a hickory tree can never be a palm nobody can take your place and you shouldn't try to take anyone else's place because you're an individual to God and God has a purpose for you he made you thus you say why did he do it he's Sovereign he's got a reason for it being that way amen God's got a reason for it being that way brother Venom was made a certain way he had certain peculiarities he had certain trademarks of his personality but God made him that way he said I'm a Melancholy God made him that way amen there's so many things about us amen God made us that way he's Sovereign in it but he says but we find out that we're all guarded by the word in heaven we look at the celestial bodies the Bible says that even one star differs from the other there is Sirius and the different ones and Mars and Jupiter and all these different ones they different one from the other the sun difference from the Moon and the moon from the stars and there is Angels such as there are seraphim and cherubims and angels and great angels in degrees and even in the new world to come the kings of the earth bring their honor into the city we're always going to be that way I want you to understand that he's talking about in the new heavens and the new Earth amen we're always going to be different we're never going to come to the place where all of a sudden we're exactly the same no we're always going to be that way because God is not a Sears and robu Harmony House he's a god of variety he makes one one way and one another but we must serve him in the way that God made us and be glad and stay behind his word amen how am I supposed to serve him in the way that he has made me amen and the purpose that he has for me and the place that he has placed me in the body and the decision he had before the foundation world that's how I'm to serve God Amen praise God I want you to pay attention to this quote in the greatest battle ever fought he he says I thought of the order of the Heavenly hosts not one of them is out of place everyone keeps his time perfectly it's God's Great Army I thought of the soldiers how that if that Moon would happen to get out of order the Earth would be covered again with water just in a few minutes the Earth would be just like it was when God decided to use it for to have us here on it it was without form and void and darkness and water was upon the breath of the earth and if that Moon would ever move it would do the same thing again when the moon rocks back a little bit away from the earth the tides come up when it goes down just follows the tides it's God's Great Army and when I thought about that being God's Great Army there now now we went to bed and then I began to think that not one of those got out of their place they all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them it's for a cause and will affect this Earth we just see the results of it now from some of them moving into other spots it's effective it affects everything and I thought then if that great Heavenly Host like that has to keep its place to to make everything in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit and I would to God this morning that we would bring this to a real healing service now listen pay close attention he's talking about everybody staying in their position and everybody staying in their place yeah now he says I would to God this morning that we bring this to a real healing service that we could keep this part group that which we have gathered under the roof this morning in such a Harmony that the Holy Spirit would place every member of the body that's here this morning in such Harmony till there would be such a spontaneous healing of the soul and body it'll if we'll just hold our positions amen amen my goodness when I read that it just stunned me said oh I'd like to bring that into a healing service what's he talking about the Heavenly Host all fitting their place and nothing gets out of order If It Moves it has an effect on the earth if it if the moon would move the Earth would be covered with water it's got to stay in God's position and move according to God's decree and now he said what about the Earthly host what if it gets out of order and I want to bring that into a healing service now till each one of us here that's under this roof would get in Harmony and get into our position and read and let me read it again and every member of the body that's here this morning in such Harmony till there would be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body if we'll just hold our position there's power in being what he called us to be there's power in staying where he called us to stay there's power in yielding to his spirit and surrendering and washing all of ourselves out of the way and let the Spirit come and do whatever he wants in our Liv lives whatever he's fashioned me for whatever he's placed me here for whatever position he wants I just want to surrender to him cuz I want to bring such a Unity such a Harmony in this place I don't want to be a part that's out of order I don't want to be trying to take somebody else's place I don't want to have the wrong idea about why he made me this I just want to get into the Harmony and the unity amen till there can be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body if we'll just hold our position so simple but so profound and you know when it comes to human beings so incredibly hard because we have so many self-doubts and we have so much Pride and Prejudice and jocking for position and pooling it's going to take a real death to self we've got to get rid of that nasty Pride that causes us wanted to rate things and move in positions and I need this spot and they shouldn't be in that spot and I should be this and they should do that and they could do that better we got to stop all of that nonsense and come come into a Harmony and say God positionally Place each one of us Place us God and work through US Lord and help me to support the one that's running with the ball help me to love the one that you're using amen and me to stay in my place and want him to stay in his place and I want it to move in harmony so that there can be such a spontaneous healing of the soul and body it will just hold our positions so much crying and so much praying and so much begging for healing and deliverance and then brother Bren is bringing it right down to if we'll just get in our position and just bring the right atmosphere and move in Harmony and in our position it'll bring that healing and deliverance that we want it'll bring the right atmosphere it'll bring the right word it'll change everything if we can each Just Surrender amen forget our ideas surrender our thinking give up on all of our this is wrong and that's right and this Just Surrender it all and say God whatever is wrong you make it right amen help me hold hold fast to my place because I don't want to be the one that gets out of Harmony and brings A disruption right help me humble myself surrender in a greater way forget everything help me to be fully connected fully plugged in fully committed to the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not going to get there holding back halfway I'm here a few Services I'm gone a couple Services I'm connected I'm not connected I'm not sure if I fit I don't fit listen we need God to show us where we're supposed to be and stay there amen and get fully connected fully engaged fully plugged in and ask God to use us for his glory or else we could be hindering the work of God for somebody else so God I want to be fully connected fully surrendered fully yielded so you can do through me whatever you want it doesn't even have to be noticed it doesn't even have to have a label that's right just do it god let's go to First Peter I want to end with this verse read this one last 1 Peter chapter 4 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 7 1 Peter 4 and 7 for the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch into prayer do you believe we're here do you believe we're living in verse 7 I believe we are verse 8 and above all things have fervent charity it's love agape love perfect love among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins use Hospitality one to another without grudging that means take care of each other without secretly wishing you didn't have to like really fervently desire to care for one another use Hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God if any man Minister let him do it as the ability which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and Dominion forever and ever amen let's all stand let us endeavor to keep the bond of love and the unity of Faith let us love you know the Bible says God so loved he gave it's an expression of God's love God so loved he gave and if we love let's give of ourselves to one another whatever whatever you know you say what should I do tomorrow just be connected be engaged be committed to the body where God has placed you and then just let it flow amen whatever comes natural whatever happens whatever comes I mean you would you'd be surprised at how just a handshake and I love you and how are you doing and God bless you will do something for somebody on a Wednesday night amen we think it has to be grandiose things and things with labels and things with titles but sometimes it's the most common of things that actually have absolute impact on our lives and you know sometimes the things that encourage us on a Wednesday or Sunday and is not necessarily all the words that we heard over the pull pit but it was the love that was expressed to one another as we came and went in this place it was the atmosphere that we created around us that brought us out of the carnal out of the world and brought us into a different level and we walk out of here somehow healed on the inside because of the atmosphere we created amen amen and that's something we're all contributing to amen let's be engaged plugged in Connected committed and giving one to another you know why I want such an atmosphere that there'll be a spontaneous healing of the soul and the body that's what I want with all my heart Deliverance healing the things we've struggled with for years the problems the families the lost loved ones I wanted to be taken care of and if it can come by us being in unity and Harmony and everyone in their position then I say let's get in our position and let's let's Endeavor to keep the bond of peace and the unity of love

you Lord for your word God we're so grateful that you sent a voice in this day God that would take and peel away so much misunderstanding and years of wrong teaching and bring us back into the light
