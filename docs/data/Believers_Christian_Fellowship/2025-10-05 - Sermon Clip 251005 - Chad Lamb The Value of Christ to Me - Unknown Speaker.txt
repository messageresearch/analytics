========================================

Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven. This man, no matter what he said, he called Jesus good and master, but no matter what he says to Jesus, he shows how much he values the word. &gt;&gt; His actions declare the value he has on Jesus Christ, the word made flesh. Because when Jesus says this, you ask me what to do, this is what you need to do. Sell all that you have, give to the poor, and you'll have treasure in heaven. Listen, if this man loved God, loved the word, loved heaven, he would sell everything for heaven &gt;&gt; because heaven's more valuable than anything on the earth. BUT HE VALUED the earth more than heaven. &gt;&gt; And then ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, TAKE up your cross, bear a reproach &gt;&gt; and follow me. And he was sad at the saying and went away grieved because he had great possessions. This is a sad story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the man has come to God in flesh. &gt;&gt; He's come to the fresh mana, to the word for his day, through the through the rock where water can flow out. come to this point &gt;&gt; and he says, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus tells him exactly what he must do. He has the ticket. He has the answer. There's no question mark. If he does what God tells him to do, he will have the results Jesus promised him. Amen. And so this man, he left sad. OH MY GOODNESS. HOW COULD HE LEAVE SAD? I WOULD LEAVE SO HAPPY. AMEN. I NOW KNOW WHAT I GOT TO DO. AND ALL I GOT TO DO IS GIVE UP THE WORLD AND HAVE HIM. ALL I GOT TO DO IS GIVE UP MY LIFE AND SACRIFICE MYSELF. AND IF I'LL DO THAT, I CAN HAVE HIM AND I CAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE AND I CAN BE WHERE HE IS. WHY WAS HE SAD? HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RUNNING AWAY, CLICKING HIS HEELS, CALLING AN AUCTIONEER ON THE WAY. WILL YOU COME AND HELP ME SELL EVERYTHING I'VE GOT? CALL THE SALVATION ARMY AND SAY, "I NEED YOU TO HELP ME DISTRIBUTE THESE GOODS BECAUSE I FOUND THE WAY TO HAVE WHAT MY HEART'S CRAVING." AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WENT AWAY SAD BECAUSE HE GAVE LIP SERVICE TO LOVING GOD. LIP SERVICE TO WANTING HEAVEN. BUT WHAT HE REALLY WANTED MORE, he valued more his fleshly carnal life than eternal life. &gt;&gt; GOD HELP ME NEVER TO FIND MYSELF IN THIS PLACE WHERE I VALUE SOMETHING OF THIS WORLD MORE THAN I VALUE ETERNAL LIFE, MORE THAN I VALUE Christ himself. &gt;&gt; CUZ REMEMBER, ETERNAL LIFE IS NOT A REWARD. Eternal life is a person. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PERSON OF GOD HIMSELF BECAUSE ONLY GOD HAS eternal life. Zoe life. &gt;&gt; Amen.
