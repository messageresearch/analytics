[11:51] be glorified amongst us we pray
[11:54] in jesus christ's name amen
[11:58] amen god bless you while we're standing
[12:00] let's turn to genesis chapter
[12:02] 17 together
[12:05] genesis chapter 17
[12:07] and we'll begin by reading a portion of
[12:10] scripture there
[12:17] i'm in genesis chapter
[12:20] 17
[12:23] verse
[12:24] 1
[12:26] and when abraham was 90 years old and
[12:28] nine the lord appeared to abram and said
[12:30] unto him
[12:31] i am the almighty god walk before me and
[12:35] be thou perfect
[12:36] and i will make my covenant between me
[12:38] and thee and will multiply thee
[12:40] exceedingly
[12:41] and abram fell on his face and god
[12:43] talked with him saying
[12:45] as for me behold my covenant is with
[12:47] thee and thou shalt be a father of many
[12:49] nations neither shall thy name any more
[12:52] be called abram but thou thy name shall
[12:54] be called abraham for a father of many
[12:56] nations have i made thee
[12:58] and i will make thee exceedingly
[13:00] fruitful and i will make nations of thee
[13:02] and king shall come out of thee and i
[13:04] will establish my covenant between me
[13:06] and thee and thy seed after thee in
[13:09] their generations for an everlasting
[13:11] covenant to be a god unto thee and to
[13:13] thy seed after thee and i will give unto
[13:16] thee unto thy seed after thee the land
[13:18] wherewith wherein thou art a stranger
[13:20] all the land of canaan for an
[13:22] everlasting possession and i will be
[13:25] their god amen god bless you as you
[13:27] seated
[13:28] may lord bless his word
[13:32] amen i want to look at verse 1 and take
[13:35] from there
[13:36] our subject tonight
[13:38] when he says i am the almighty god
[13:42] this is a term that's used for the first
[13:44] time in our bible when he says almighty
[13:46] god and that term is actually el shaddai
[13:50] and i'd like to minister tonight on el
[13:52] shaddai
[13:53] for a little while but when he says i am
[13:57] the almighty god the el shaddai
[14:00] he says
[14:01] walk before me and be thou perfect and
[14:04] he says i will make
[14:06] my covenant between me and thee and i
[14:08] will multiply thee exceedingly now god
[14:11] begins to declare what he's going to do
[14:15] this is what i'm going to do i'm going
[14:17] to keep my covenant between thee and me
[14:19] i am going to multiply thy sea
[14:22] i have
[14:23] out of you are going to come many
[14:25] nations i will bring you to the land i
[14:27] will establish your seed and my promise
[14:29] with thee and i see that i will do this
[14:32] i will do this i will do this praise
[14:34] almighty god so when god uses this new
[14:37] term uh and and
[14:39] expressing himself to abraham he uses
[14:42] this term that's in our bible almighty
[14:44] god but the term is el shaddai after he
[14:47] uses this term el shaddai he begins to
[14:49] say i'm going to do this i'm going to do
[14:52] this i'm going to do this i'm going to
[14:54] do this amen so he wasn't depending on
[14:57] abraham and abraham's strength he wasn't
[14:59] depending on abraham's ability he was
[15:02] telling abraham i am el shaddai and this
[15:05] is what i'm going to do
[15:06] so i'd like to look at what brother
[15:08] better says about this term el shaddai
[15:11] it's very interesting
[15:13] in the in the message god of the
[15:14] provided way from 1956 said if you break
[15:18] those words down sometimes maybe i'd
[15:20] like to have a revival at the tabernacle
[15:22] here in jeffersonville when we can get
[15:24] our tent and things set up somewhere
[15:26] where we could take those words and
[15:28] break them down and see what they mean
[15:30] just the meaning of those words
[15:32] the almighty in hebrew is el shaddai
[15:34] which means the breast like a woman
[15:38] abraham i'm coming to you in the name of
[15:40] the breasted one the nurse the
[15:42] life-giver
[15:44] this is so interesting the the word
[15:46] picture that the bible's painting and
[15:48] what brother bannon picks up on amen is
[15:50] going to it means so much to me amen and
[15:53] i hope to share that the way it's come
[15:55] to me
[15:56] he says like a little baby when it's
[15:57] sick you know the mother holds it to her
[16:00] breast and she nurses it and the little
[16:02] baby is fretting and crying and skinny
[16:04] but it just lays there and nurses and
[16:06] gets strong where is it nursing its life
[16:09] from from the mother and god appears to
[16:12] us today as el shaddai the breasted one
[16:14] both of them the new and old testament
[16:17] just as full of promises as they can be
[16:20] not a breast but the breast excuse me
[16:23] but the breast did too amen and he's
[16:25] showing that's it's it's not it comes
[16:28] from the
[16:29] root word shad which is breast for a
[16:31] woman amen but it should die and he says
[16:33] it's brother bremtel says it's plural
[16:35] the breasted god and he types it right
[16:38] back with the new and old testament amen
[16:40] it's the word of god amen that's giving
[16:42] his children strength amen brother
[16:44] branham also types it with salvation and
[16:47] healing amen the the the two places that
[16:50] draw strength for salvation and for
[16:53] healing amen
[16:55] he also says in the message the approach
[16:57] to god from 1955 he says
[17:00] the word in hebrew l almighty means el
[17:02] shaddai which means the almighty one or
[17:05] el means god and shadow means breath
[17:07] should die is in the plural
[17:10] i am the almighty the strong one the
[17:12] all-sufficient one you see it now
[17:14] abraham watched what that name was that
[17:17] he appeared i am the el shaddai in other
[17:19] words i am the breasted one abraham the
[17:22] god really the word shad comes from in
[17:24] the bible it means like the woman the
[17:26] place the nursing place of the baby in
[17:28] other words abraham i am the strong one
[17:31] i am the life-giver not only a
[17:33] life-giver like a baby fretting i am the
[17:35] satisfier
[17:36] the little baby if he's fretting sick
[17:38] still got the tummy ache as long as he's
[17:41] laying on his mother's arms nursing it
[17:43] satisfies him oh my you get it he may be
[17:46] sick and this little head is swimming
[17:48] around everything else but if he's
[17:50] laying on his mother's arms his mother's
[17:52] breast nursing it pacifies him no matter
[17:55] how sick you are what takes place how
[17:58] long the lord is answering as long as
[17:59] you're laying on his breast pulling from
[18:01] the word it satisfies the believer
[18:05] amen i think it's interesting this this
[18:08] word picture amen because if you if you
[18:11] take it some of the
[18:13] newer translations of the bible don't
[18:15] write almighty god and if you look in
[18:18] the strong's um not in strong's but here
[18:20] in the scofield bible amen scofield
[18:23] makes a note very similar to what
[18:24] brother brampton taught us amen so i'm
[18:26] sure he read these notes and he tells us
[18:28] the same thing but he says it's a shame
[18:30] that this term has been translated
[18:33] almighty god because the name el already
[18:36] means the mighty one he as l and elohim
[18:39] he is already the mighty one he is
[18:41] already the almighty he's already the
[18:43] strong one amen so it's it's it's like a
[18:46] redundant term the almighty god el
[18:49] already covers the fact that he's the
[18:51] mighty one and he's god
[18:53] but shaddai brings another expression of
[18:57] the nature of god and it shows that god
[19:00] is the one who can supply amen like a
[19:03] mother can supply for her baby and if
[19:05] you catch the word picture here when an
[19:07] infant is born to a mother amen that
[19:10] infant needs nothing else but what comes
[19:13] from mother amen so mother in order to
[19:16] sustain the life of this infant amen
[19:18] mother becomes the all-sufficient one
[19:21] for life mother becomes the
[19:23] all-sufficient one for comfort she
[19:25] becomes the all-sufficient one for
[19:27] strength amen you take a fretting infant
[19:29] you know you take one that's a few weeks
[19:31] old amen and fretting and upset and and
[19:34] and maybe not feeling well or whatever
[19:36] amen there's no nothing that dad can do
[19:39] amen
[19:41] amen your dad you love this baby this
[19:43] baby is part of you 23 of its
[19:46] chromosomes have come from you
[19:48] you you're part of making this life amen
[19:51] but you don't have what the baby needs
[19:54] amen what mother has is what the baby
[19:56] needs and she becomes the all-sufficient
[19:59] source of life and comfort in everything
[20:01] this baby needs so when god comes to
[20:04] abraham he is saying i am the
[20:06] all-sufficient one i am everything you
[20:09] need i will keep my covenant i will
[20:12] raise you up a nation i will restore
[20:14] your sin i will i will i will all you
[20:17] have to do is come to me and draw
[20:19] strength and draw life and draw
[20:21] satisfaction
[20:23] amen and god is still today el shaddai
[20:25] amen he is all i need he has everything
[20:28] i need we don't need anything else we
[20:31] need the almighty god el shaddai amen
[20:33] the all-sufficient one who's the creator
[20:36] of life and the sustainer of life and
[20:38] the great comforter at the same time
[20:43] amen
[20:44] that little infant you know when it gets
[20:46] to feeling bad and needs something amen
[20:49] there's nobody that can satisfy it like
[20:52] mother
[20:54] when it lays against mother and all is
[20:56] well amen all is well and it begins the
[21:00] the el shaddai becomes the great
[21:02] comforter and becomes the great
[21:04] satisfier now the baby is satisfied but
[21:08] but the the comfort and satisfaction
[21:10] aren't the only thing being gained amen
[21:13] at mother's bosom because it is
[21:15] satisfied the baby is comforted and when
[21:18] we come to the word of god and receive
[21:20] the promises of god it satisfies us it
[21:23] comforts our heart amen but it does
[21:25] something else it puts strength into the
[21:27] baby amen it puts strength it puts life
[21:30] that brings strength that will actually
[21:33] bring growth and bring the word to pass
[21:35] it's coming amen as the child of god
[21:38] connects to god and begins to draw from
[21:41] god the word the promises that are made
[21:43] amen it not just satisfies but it gives
[21:46] strength amen the strength to bring the
[21:48] word to pass
[21:50] that's what god was coming to abraham he
[21:52] had already given abraham a promise
[21:56] is that right
[21:57] abraham already had a promise he already
[21:59] had the word he was already told amen
[22:02] that he'll be a father amen but now
[22:04] comes el shaddai who says now i'm i'm
[22:08] the strength of that word amen i'm the
[22:11] life source for that word if you come to
[22:14] me i'll provide the strength to bring
[22:16] that word to pass
[22:19] praise god
[22:22] this morning i'd like to or this evening
[22:24] it's not morning god help us
[22:26] we're going to read quite a few
[22:28] scriptures so if you can turn with me to

[25:48] in the message i have heard but now i
[25:49] see he says now just like abraham when
[25:52] he was 90 and 9 years old
[25:54] i believe in genesis 17 god appeared to
[25:56] this old man now 99 years old when he
[25:59] was almost 100 years old and they had
[26:01] been waiting upon that promise all these
[26:03] years he appeared to him in the name of
[26:05] el shaddai
[26:06] the breasted one and what an
[26:08] encouragement it was yet the promise
[26:10] wasn't fulfilled then but abraham i am
[26:12] the almighty god el shaddai the strength
[26:14] giver the breasted god like i've told
[26:17] you before like the little baby that's
[26:19] fretting and sick and crying and it lays
[26:21] upon its mother's breast and nurses his
[26:23] strength back from her because it's
[26:25] satisfied while it's a nursing
[26:27] because the only access it has and knows
[26:30] of
[26:31] is the mother's breast it knows no dose
[26:33] of medicine you might give him a dose of
[26:35] medicine he'd squeal and cry give him a
[26:37] shot in the arm he'd carry on but the
[26:40] only access to satisfy him is the
[26:42] mother's breast
[26:43] and he said abraham you're old your
[26:46] strength is gone your arms are withered
[26:48] up your manhood's gone but i am your
[26:50] mother that's what the prophet of god
[26:53] said i am your mother just take a hold
[26:56] of my promise and be satisfied while
[26:58] you're waiting be rested amen
[27:01] oh praise be to god he says i
[27:04] brother branham says i'm your mother
[27:06] amen i'm going to care for you i'm going
[27:09] to nurture you
[27:11] in the message thirst from 65 he says
[27:13] notice jerusalem the word jerusalem is
[27:16] from above the bible said which is the
[27:19] mother of us all and christ is our
[27:21] mother we realize that god is our mother
[27:23] for we are born of him amen so we know
[27:26] that god amen is represented in both
[27:29] male and female god has male attributes
[27:31] and female attributes amen so god is our
[27:34] father and our mother
[27:36] and then he takes on both attributes as
[27:38] he relates himself to mankind amen and
[27:41] and there's an attribute of mother where
[27:44] he will give of himself he'll give of
[27:47] his own life he'll give of his own
[27:49] strength and he'll give it amen to his
[27:51] waiting child amen who can nurse from
[27:53] him from drawing from him that life
[27:56] stream that word amen that that stream
[27:59] that they need to live and to grow amen
[28:01] and take courage and take strength he'll
[28:03] give of himself because the mother gives
[28:06] of herself to her child amen when the
[28:09] when the baby needs something it needs
[28:11] its mother it needs strength it needs
[28:13] nourishment it needs comfort it needs
[28:15] all of those things she'll take that
[28:16] little infant amen and take that infant
[28:18] to herself and she will give of herself
[28:21] of her strength to the baby
[28:24] even sometimes when mom is weak and
[28:26] tired and up in the night amen and not
[28:29] feeling well it doesn't change anything
[28:32] she'll still give her strength to that
[28:34] child amen she'll give her strength in
[28:36] the middle of the night in the morning
[28:38] all day long amen she'll give her
[28:40] strength to that child because that's
[28:42] the only source the child has it has no
[28:45] other option but to come back to mama
[28:47] and get comfort get strength and find
[28:50] rest in the arms of mother
[28:54] amen
[28:55] we need the we need to we need to have
[28:58] that same approach unto god sometimes i
[29:01] have no other place to go i have no
[29:03] other option amen there's no nothing
[29:05] else that's going to give me strength
[29:07] for life there's nothing else that'll
[29:09] make this word come to pass i've got to
[29:11] get a hold of this live stream from god
[29:14] and i've got to draw and draw and draw
[29:17] and rest in his arms will i draw from
[29:19] him the strength i need and then he will
[29:22] perform his word he will bring it to
[29:24] pass
[29:26] praise god almighty
[29:30] we need god to be our mother and our
[29:33] father
[29:36] what care
[29:37] what love
[29:39] what what an ability
[29:41] to provide all that we need
[29:44] so the word picture for the word picture
[29:47] for us that the bible's painting that
[29:49] brother brenham opens up for us in
[29:52] understanding is there is a there is a
[29:55] people who have no other option
[29:58] there are people who don't have a plan b
[30:01] there are people who who who don't find
[30:04] their own way they can't get their own
[30:06] anything amen there is a people on this
[30:08] earth that know no better than to come
[30:10] back to the source of life come back to
[30:13] the one that brought them forth and keep
[30:15] drawing strength and nursing amen from
[30:18] the word of god and pulling down
[30:20] everything we have need of because
[30:22] there's a people on the earth that don't
[30:24] have anywhere else to go amen god's not
[30:26] giving us denominational bottles and
[30:28] denominational formula but he's giving
[30:30] of himself amen his word is himself the
[30:34] life of the word is his very own life
[30:36] and he's giving us life as we draw from
[30:39] his word
[30:41] there's a there's a people who can't get
[30:44] satisfied anyplace else amen
[30:46] you can't give me an imposter pacifier
[30:49] it might work for a few minutes amen but
[30:51] when no life comes from it i'm gonna
[30:54] spit the pacifier out and call for the
[30:56] real thing amen
[30:57] there's so many pacifiers in life and
[31:00] entertainments and religious societies
[31:02] and religious notions amen they're
[31:04] little pacifiers amen just giving a
[31:07] sucking motion to satisfy and quiet down
[31:10] the nerves of some people but there's no
[31:12] life coming from that pacifier there's
[31:15] no word stream life coming amen and that
[31:18] baby will only be pacified for so long
[31:21] amen because it's got to have strength
[31:23] and it can't get it anywhere else from
[31:26] god but from god almighty
[31:29] so we need to spit all the religious
[31:31] pacifiers out
[31:32] and forget all the man-made formula
[31:35] and come back to the one that gave us
[31:38] life come back to the one that birthed
[31:40] us in the word and draw from them life
[31:44] praise god
[31:45] let's look at isaiah together
[31:48] isaiah 49.
[31:59] isaiah 49 and verse 15.
[32:01] [Music]
[32:08] isaiah 49 15 can a woman forget her
[32:10] suckling child
[32:12] that she should not have compassion on
[32:14] the son of her womb
[32:15] yea they may forget
[32:18] yet will i not forget thee
[32:22] we have a better spiritual mother than
[32:25] that
[32:26] they may forget and look what he goes he
[32:28] goes to the strongest human bond that
[32:30] you can find between a mother and her
[32:33] suckling child
[32:35] it is one of the strikes the strongest
[32:37] human bond that there is is between a
[32:39] mother and a suckling child and he says
[32:42] is it even possible for a mother to
[32:44] forget her child if it is even possible
[32:46] yea though she may
[32:48] i will never forget thee my bond with
[32:51] you will never be broken
[32:53] even if it's possible for the strongest
[32:55] attachment on earth maybe in some wicked
[32:58] form a woman amen can become detached
[33:01] from her suckling child but god never
[33:03] will detach from you
[33:05] he will never put you away amen he will
[33:08] never detach from his child he'll never
[33:10] forget his child
[33:14] let me go and read this next verse
[33:18] behold i have graven thee upon the palms
[33:20] of my hands thy walls are continually
[33:23] before me
[33:24] this is the god who's watching for your
[33:26] foot not to slip because he never sleeps
[33:31] amen when
[33:32] when this el shaddai
[33:35] come to abraham
[33:36] abraham had no strength
[33:38] to perform the word
[33:40] physically his body was finished
[33:43] his stream of life was dried up
[33:45] there was no possibility for him to
[33:48] bring forth to perform the word of god
[33:50] but he didn't need to perform the word
[33:52] of god all he had to do was lay in the
[33:54] arms of el shaddai
[33:56] all he had to do was trust in the
[33:58] promise that was given to him and if
[34:00] he'll trust in the promise and draw life
[34:02] from the promise the word of god will
[34:04] produce its own life in him amen and
[34:07] change his very body
[34:08] [Music]
[34:10] in the message
[34:11] jehovah jireh from 1964 the prophet of
[34:14] god says he is still el shaddai
[34:17] you believe that
[34:19] i i don't just believe that i need that
[34:22] to be true
[34:24] it's not just i believe that he still
[34:26] should die i need him to remain el
[34:28] shaddai
[34:29] amen when i'm all tore up and i and i'm
[34:32] in a mess and i don't know what's
[34:34] happening and i get nervous and i get
[34:35] upset i need el shaddai amen and when i
[34:38] get to where i get weak and i need some
[34:40] strength i need el shaddai i need him to
[34:43] remain el shaddai i need him to always
[34:46] remain the faithful one who will not
[34:48] forget me even if a woman can forget her
[34:50] suckling child he'll not forget me and
[34:53] there's a source that i can go to in
[34:55] times of need for comfort and for
[34:58] strength
[35:00] he is still el shaddai he is still the
[35:02] breasted god new and old testament just
[35:05] draw your strength from it oh everything
[35:07] you have need of
[35:09] the baby he is helpless
[35:11] he has to pull his strength from his
[35:13] mother that's the only way he can get
[35:15] his strength that's the only way a
[35:17] believer can get his strength is to pull
[35:19] it from the word of god that is his
[35:21] strength god's promise to him stand by
[35:24] it and believe it
[35:26] listen nothing else will produce
[35:30] everything else is a weak substitute
[35:35] there's nothing there's no form of
[35:36] entertainment there's no form of man's
[35:38] wisdom there's no form of man's religion
[35:40] there's no form of psychology there's
[35:43] nothing else that will produce what we
[35:45] have need of amen only el shaddai giving
[35:50] us his strength and us nursing from him
[35:52] from his word the strength we need it's
[35:54] the only thing and we need
[35:56] we need to recognize
[35:59] that we as children of god
[36:01] are just as helpless as a newborn baby
[36:04] without its mother
[36:06] we as children of god without el shaddai
[36:09] are just as helpless and doomed to
[36:12] failure and death is it an infant is
[36:14] without its mother we without without el
[36:17] shaddai are in the same place
[36:19] [Music]
[36:21] and if we would realize that we would be
[36:23] ten times better off than we are today
[36:27] all of our problems all of our failures
[36:29] all of our mistakes is because we
[36:31] thought we had a little strength and we
[36:32] thought we knew what to do we thought we
[36:34] could overcome and we thought we could
[36:36] do a few things and we tried some other
[36:38] techniques or we tried some other ways
[36:40] instead of just sticking with the word
[36:42] and coming to the word and drawing from
[36:44] the word we tried a little reasoning and
[36:46] we tried a little tradition and we tried
[36:48] a little of somebody else's ideas and
[36:50] somebody else's suggestions and i'll
[36:52] tell you i don't know where it got you
[36:54] but i knew where it got me it's gotten
[36:55] me into heaps of trouble amen i need to
[36:58] realize that there's only one source for
[37:00] my strength is to come back to el
[37:02] shaddai and say oh god i'm laying here
[37:05] for satisfaction for comfort and for
[37:07] strength
[37:10] we need to pull from the word of god and
[37:12] the word of god only
[37:18] amen
[37:20] i think this is why i this me person
[37:23] just a personal preference i hate to see
[37:26] a baby with a propped bottle sitting all
[37:28] by itself
[37:32] and
[37:33] bottle propped over against the thing
[37:35] and mom off doing something else
[37:37] i'm like that's not the picture god
[37:39] painted
[37:40] amen that baby needs to be held
[37:44] needs to be comforted needs to be
[37:46] nurtured needs to needs a mother it
[37:49] needs more than just food it needs
[37:51] comfort it needs to be satisfied by mom
[37:55] that's why
[37:56] god is so gracious to us that he makes
[37:58] his presence known and he promised to be
[38:01] a friend that sticketh closer than a
[38:02] brother amen because he didn't just give
[38:05] us his word and move off somewhere else
[38:07] and treat it like a prop bottle amen but
[38:10] god says come unto me you that are laid
[38:12] in heavy heavy laden weary i will give
[38:14] you rest amen come unto me amen he's not
[38:18] just that i sent my word and now you go
[38:20] deal with it no he sent his word but he
[38:22] says come to me and draw strength amen
[38:24] come to me for comfort come to me for
[38:26] your satisfaction amen he has all that
[38:29] we need and he is all that we need
[38:34] let's go back to psalm 91.
[38:53] psalm 91 verse 1
[38:54] [Music]
[38:56] he that dwelleth
[38:57] in the secret place of the most high
[39:00] shall abide under the shadow of the
[39:02] almighty this a word almighty should die
[39:06] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[39:08] the most high shall abide under the
[39:10] shadow of the shaddai
[39:12] the breasted god
[39:15] i will say of the lord he is my refuge
[39:17] and my fortress my god and him will i
[39:20] trust
[39:21] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[39:23] snare of the fowler and from the noise
[39:25] and pestilence he shall cover thee with
[39:27] his feathers and under his wings shalt
[39:29] thou trust his truth shall be thy shield
[39:32] and buckler thou shall not be afraid for
[39:34] the terror by night for the arrow that
[39:36] flyeth by day nor for the pestilence
[39:38] that walketh in darkness nor for the
[39:40] destruction that wasteth at noonday
[39:44] why will we not be afraid because i'm
[39:46] under the shadow of el shaddai
[39:49] why will i not be afraid because he's
[39:51] covered me with his feathers i'm
[39:53] underneath his wings what's it mean to
[39:54] be under his wings like a mother
[39:56] brooding over her chicks pulling them to
[39:58] her side and sheltering under her wings
[40:01] she becomes their protection she becomes
[40:03] their safety she becomes their wall of
[40:05] defense that's what god is to us amen he
[40:08] is our security he is our safety he is
[40:11] our satisfier he is our wall of defense
[40:13] he is our fortress he's our shield and
[40:15] buckler he is our strong tower
[40:19] we got the picture amen i think we need
[40:21] to stop being afraid to run to him amen
[40:24] we got to stop being afraid to run to
[40:26] him and say god i need you amen i need
[40:29] you this moment i need you every moment
[40:31] amen i if there's one thing that i wish
[40:34] that i could completely erase from my
[40:35] existence is that it's any form of pride
[40:39] amen it was sewn into humanity at the
[40:42] fall because you see it rise up in cain
[40:44] and when you see it in lucifer and
[40:46] lucifer's nature entered in through the
[40:47] serpent because that was the spirit he
[40:49] was anointed and comes into cain and
[40:51] cain rises up in pride and defiance
[40:53] against god and since that time humanity
[40:56] has been suffering with this curse of
[40:58] pride amen somehow we feel like we can
[41:01] do something or we're strong enough or
[41:03] we have something figured out i said god
[41:05] erase that from me that thing has
[41:07] destroyed my life
[41:10] everything that i have suffered from
[41:12] i've suffered with from human pride
[41:15] but let me be
[41:17] as
[41:18] weak
[41:19] and pitiful
[41:20] as an infant
[41:22] let me consider myself incapable of
[41:25] taking care of myself
[41:27] help me god to see myself as helpless
[41:30] without you help me to see myself as
[41:32] completely dependent upon you amen and
[41:35] then i think we'll get the right picture
[41:37] because when we come to him completely
[41:39] helpless and completely dependent then
[41:41] he pours his strength into us and then
[41:43] the strength that we have to live the
[41:45] life and do the works of god it's not us
[41:48] anymore even jesus says it's not me that
[41:51] doeth the works it's the father that
[41:52] dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[41:56] so then when we draw strength amen now
[41:59] it's not our strength it's his strength
[42:01] that's come through his word amen and
[42:03] now it's his word living out through us
[42:05] because it's his strength
[42:09] help us god to recognize
[42:11] that we are helpless without you
[42:16] let's go to matthew 23.
[42:28] matthew 23
[42:30] and verse 37
[42:36] matthew 23 and verse 20
[42:40] i'm sorry matthew 23 and verse 37 o
[42:44] jerusalem
[42:45] jerusalem thou that killeth the prophets
[42:47] and stonethem which are sent unto thee
[42:50] how oft how often would i have gathered
[42:53] thy children together even as a hen
[42:55] gather their chickens under her wings
[42:58] and he would not
[43:00] and you would not
[43:02] same kind of picture
[43:04] jerusalem how oft would i have gathered
[43:06] you
[43:08] as a hen gathers her chicks underneath
[43:11] their wings just like he said in the
[43:13] psalms he covers us with feathers
[43:15] he would have done this for jerusalem
[43:17] but they wouldn't
[43:18] they had their own idea they had their
[43:20] own strength they had their own way of
[43:22] doing things but he was there willing to
[43:25] cover them
[43:26] i say today he's here willing to cover
[43:29] us but we've got to recognize we need to
[43:32] be covered under his wings we need to be
[43:34] under his feathers amen
[43:37] i mean there's so much that we just feel
[43:40] like in the routine of life that we've
[43:42] got covered and we can take care of but
[43:44] i say there's not a day that we can make
[43:46] it without him
[43:47] there's not a moment that we could
[43:49] survive without him we need to be if
[43:52] there's an offer to come under his wings
[43:54] i want to be under his wings if he's
[43:56] present spreading his wings and there's
[43:58] a place of shelter and refuge i want to
[44:00] be under those wings covered with
[44:02] feathers because i don't want to take on
[44:04] the world outside of that shelter
[44:06] outside of that fortress
[44:08] and thank god he's here he gave
[44:11] jerusalem the opportunities that how
[44:13] often would i have done this but you
[44:16] would not it wasn't god's lack it wasn't
[44:18] god's unwillingness it was the people's
[44:20] unwillingness to come under his wings he
[44:22] was there he provided he had the shelter
[44:25] he gave the word he sent the prophets he
[44:28] had everything in place they're the ones
[44:30] who refused
[44:34] and i believe with all my heart el
[44:35] shaddai is still present
[44:38] he's here
[44:40] he's the mighty one he's the breasted
[44:42] god he's got more than enough for
[44:45] comfort for strength for rest but we've
[44:48] got to go to him and draw
[44:51] the message there's a message brother
[44:52] ben preached from that time in 1960 and
[44:55] he says what does the baby have to do
[44:58] he says we are god's babies
[45:02] i don't feel so bad now
[45:04] we are god's babies i want you to get
[45:06] this sisters you all there we're god's
[45:09] babies and what does the baby do when
[45:11] it's sick
[45:12] and freddie it's real freddy and sick
[45:15] now the only thing you have to do the
[45:17] only thing that will pacify it is for
[45:19] the mother to pick it up hold it to her
[45:21] bosom and nurse it
[45:22] now what does the mother do the mother
[45:25] produces the milk and the baby nurses
[45:27] the strength from the mother to the baby
[45:30] then the baby is strengthened by the
[45:31] mother's strength and when we take hold
[45:34] of god's promise into our heart we are
[45:36] nursing god's strength the strong one so
[45:39] when we take god's promise into our
[45:41] heart we're nursing his strength into

[47:18] themselves the golden oil the life amen
[47:21] the holy spirit and pouring it into the
[47:23] candlestick which is the type of the
[47:25] church and when

[47:29] meant amen the angel said this is the
[47:31] word of the lord and the cerebral not by
[47:33] my not by power not by strength but by

[48:32] shaddai amen from the promised word
[48:36] praise be to god
[48:39] let's go to first kings
[48:42] 19.
[48:56] first kings 19.
[49:03] i love this story
[49:06] because it's elijah
[49:10] and i love this because it shows the
[49:11] tenderness of god with his children
[49:16] first kings 19 verse 1
[49:20] and ahab told jezebel all that elijah
[49:23] had done this is after the mount carmel
[49:24] showdown when elijah challenged the
[49:27] prophets of baal the priest had baal and
[49:29] he had slew them all
[49:32] and ahab goes and tells jezebel
[49:34] and with all how he had slain all the
[49:36] prophets with the sword
[49:39] excuse me then jezebel sent a messenger
[49:42] unto elijah saying let
[49:44] so let the gods do to me and more also
[49:47] if i make not thy life as the life of
[49:49] one of them by tomorrow about this time
[49:52] and when he saw that he arose and went
[49:54] for his life and came to beersheba which
[49:56] belonged to judah and left his servant
[49:58] there but he himself went a day's
[50:01] journey into the wilderness and came and
[50:02] sat down under a juniper tree and he
[50:05] requested for himself that he might die
[50:07] and said it is enough now oh lord take
[50:10] away my life for i am not better than my
[50:12] father's
[50:14] and as he lay and slept under a juniper
[50:16] tree behold then an angel touched him
[50:19] and suddenly him arise and eat
[50:22] and he looked and behold there was a
[50:23] cake baked on the coals in a cruise of
[50:26] water at his head and he did eat and
[50:28] drink and laid him down again
[50:31] and the angel of the lord came again the
[50:32] second time and touched him and said
[50:34] arise and eat because the journey is too
[50:37] great for thee
[50:40] we get a picture here of elijah
[50:42] after the mount carmel showdown he had
[50:44] had a tremendous success
[50:47] in the meetings doing what god had said
[50:49] just obeying the vision that the lord
[50:51] had given him
[50:52] it was tremendously successful it was a
[50:54] showdown amen between uh the the
[50:56] prophets and priests of baal and the
[50:58] prophet of god and god showed up and god
[51:01] performed a miracle amen and was to turn
[51:04] the hearts of the children back to the
[51:05] fathers and slew the priest and prophets
[51:08] of baal and had a great victory but then
[51:11] now jezebel
[51:12] puts a threat on his life and he runs
[51:14] away he runs away into the wilderness
[51:17] amen and he climbs under a juniper tree
[51:20] and he asks god to take his life
[51:24] and you know god doesn't rebuke him
[51:27] god doesn't chastise him
[51:30] god doesn't call him names god doesn't
[51:32] belittle him
[51:34] god sends an angel to feed him
[51:37] brother brahma says in 1959 the message
[51:40] what hearst thou elijah he he gives us
[51:43] some background to this story he fills
[51:45] in some of the blanks for us
[51:47] he's the poor little fella skinny laying
[51:49] there in his gray hair hanging over his
[51:51] shoulders
[51:52] god said my servant needs some rest
[51:55] god's mercy to a servant he just laid
[51:57] him down on the bunch of weeds and he
[51:59] went to sleep
[52:01] i'd imagine there was ten thousand
[52:02] angels watching him sleep there's one
[52:04] assurance the believer has though the
[52:06] world turned him down yet god loves him
[52:11] it's one assurance the believer has if
[52:13] the whole world turns you down god still
[52:15] loves
[52:18] the world may call you holy roller they
[52:20] may call you fanatic but if you're true
[52:22] to god there's one sure thing god loves
[52:24] you and his angels are encamped about
[52:27] those who fear him
[52:29] i'd imagine on every limb all around
[52:31] through the place was swarms of angels
[52:33] and god came down and he said my poor
[52:36] little tired servant now i want you to
[52:39] we can think about elijah and brother
[52:41] dramatizing for elijah but you for a
[52:44] moment go to your worst day
[52:47] go to the worst day you've had
[52:51] when you had no more strength to go on
[52:53] when you wished you despaired of life
[52:55] when you wished that you could just go
[52:57] on to the sixth dimension
[53:00] when you wish that you could just you
[53:02] wished it could all be over you wish
[53:03] that that you could just god could just
[53:05] take you on or that we could all go
[53:07] together
[53:09] and the great catching away
[53:11] and under trouble and under stress and
[53:15] and and tired and weak and feeling like
[53:18] a completely worthless as a child of god
[53:22] running away
[53:23] too tired to fight too tired to stand
[53:26] too wore out to even you know stand for
[53:30] truth anymore you're just under a
[53:31] juniper bush you're you're you're
[53:33] finished
[53:35] put yourself there
[53:37] and he said i imagine there's ten
[53:38] thousand angels
[53:40] around those limbs
[53:42] do you think elijah thought so
[53:44] you think he felt like god was watching
[53:47] over him
[53:48] you felt like you think he felt like he
[53:51] was he was the apple of god's eye that
[53:53] god was watching him unless his foot
[53:54] should slip and he was the god that
[53:56] doesn't slumber
[53:58] he was saying god
[53:59] what what good is it i'm no better than
[54:01] my father's just take me now let me die
[54:05] little did he know all around were 10
[54:08] 000 angels
[54:10] watching over him
[54:12] and your worst day never changed god's
[54:15] opinion of you
[54:18] the worst day for a child of god amen is
[54:21] when it comes to the affection of god
[54:23] and god's desire for you and god's plan
[54:25] for you your worst day was no different
[54:27] than your best day because god's
[54:29] thoughts of you doesn't change
[54:31] their eternal
[54:32] god's desire for you doesn't change he
[54:34] had a desire for you before the
[54:36] foundation of the world
[54:38] will god spank a child he'll spank a
[54:40] child and he'll spank you good sometimes

[54:59] were camped about him and god was going
[55:01] to take care of him
[55:04] he says i'll read that again he he i'd
[55:08] imagine on every limb all around through
[55:10] the place with swarms of angels
[55:12] and god came down and he said my poor
[55:15] little tired servant

[58:47] this
[58:48] the lord your god who loves you
[58:50] you've done your best elijah i only sent
[58:53] those signs for a witness that in the

[59:15] angelic choir come out formed a little
[59:17] panoramic around him like that and began
[59:19] to sing the songs like no mother could
[59:22] coo her baby to sleep

[59:26] around and said you know i love him so
[59:28] much the journey's great he's got a lot
[59:31] to go through with yet i'm not through
[59:33] with him yet so i must feed him again

[59:38] another big bundle of vitamins and
[59:40] cooked up another corn cake and sent him
[59:42] a cruise of water and stroked his brow
[59:44] and fed him again
[59:46] i'm so glad that there is a juniper tree
[59:49] when we get all worn and tore up we can
[59:51] go under that juniper tree and find
[59:53] spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of
[59:56] a trip
[59:57] there he laid
[59:58] woke up feeling a little better and went

[1:00:05] you like to know what kind of vitamins
[1:00:06] he used that'll keep a man on corn cake
[1:00:09] and a glass of water for 40 days and 40
[1:00:11] nights
[1:00:12] that's the power of our god
[1:00:17] see
[1:00:18] the angel brought down
[1:00:20] a little corn cake
[1:00:23] full of vitamins
[1:00:26] but today god keeps dropping us manna
[1:00:29] from heaven
[1:00:30] keeps bringing us portions of his word
[1:00:32] amen full of vitamins for the journey
[1:00:36] amen and then he brings it down to us
[1:00:38] and it's his mercy it's his love it's
[1:00:40] his grace to his children that he keeps
[1:00:43] bringing when we're all war out and
[1:00:44] tired he'll bring another corn cake amen
[1:00:46] he'll bring another man up he'll bring
[1:00:48] something down he'll send an angel from
[1:00:51] heaven amen to come at the right season
[1:00:53] the time and bring some bread from
[1:00:55] heaven amen and bring it to you amen and
[1:00:58] bring some water so that you can get
[1:01:00] strength for that to finish the
[1:01:01] commission that god has and it was god
[1:01:04] in his tender mercies it was god and his
[1:01:06] love for elijah amen he wasn't pushing
[1:01:09] elijah kicking elijah yelling at elijah
[1:01:12] but there's a tender side to god when it
[1:01:14] comes to his children god understands
[1:01:17] that doesn't mean god won't correct you
[1:01:18] get out of line he has a rod he has a
[1:01:21] staff amen but when you've done the best
[1:01:23] you can and you get all wore out don't
[1:01:26] worry there's a loving heavenly father
[1:01:28] that'll send an angel with a corn cake
[1:01:30] that's got vitamins that'll get you
[1:01:32] going the next part of the journey
[1:01:34] why is it we keep playing the tapes amen
[1:01:37] because it's manna from heaven why is it
[1:01:39] we keep coming to church amen it's to
[1:01:41] get the baked corn cakes from our father
[1:01:43] who's caring for us in the journey
[1:01:45] there's still more journey left we're
[1:01:47] not finished here yet there's more to do
[1:01:49] there's more of god's plan in our lives
[1:01:51] but oh we need him to come and sustain
[1:01:54] us we need him when we're at the end of
[1:01:56] our rope he's got to give some more rope
[1:01:58] when we have nothing left he's got to
[1:02:00] give us something to keep us going
[1:02:03] he's got to be the god who gives
[1:02:06] nourishment and strength and comfort to
[1:02:09] the weary
[1:02:11] we can't give it to ourselves
[1:02:14] let's go to jeremiah chapter 17.
[1:02:22] praise god
[1:02:26] jeremiah chapter 17.
[1:02:37] jeremiah 17 and verse 7
[1:02:42] blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[1:02:44] lord
[1:02:44] and whose hope
[1:02:46] is
[1:02:47] whose hope the lord is
[1:02:50] read that again blessed is the man that
[1:02:52] trusteth in the lord
[1:02:54] and whose hope the lord is
[1:02:57] that means if you put all your trust in
[1:02:59] him you're blessed
[1:03:02] if the lord is your hope you're blessed
[1:03:06] if you have no other hope you're blessed
[1:03:09] if you have no other source you're
[1:03:11] blessed if you have no place else to
[1:03:13] turn you're blessed if your hope is in
[1:03:16] the lord and the lord is your hope
[1:03:18] you're a blessed person
[1:03:20] amen those those who have options will
[1:03:23] keep taking options amen but when you
[1:03:25] come down to no more options then you
[1:03:27] come back to the source of life and
[1:03:29] receive the strength that we need for
[1:03:31] the journey
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:35] the prophet of god says in 1955 he says
[1:03:38] abraham was an old man
[1:03:40] a hundred years old when god appeared to
[1:03:41] him in the name of almighty god the
[1:03:43] almighty
[1:03:45] there comes from the hebrew word of el
[1:03:47] shaddai which means the bosom abreast of
[1:03:49] a woman now he was old his strength was
[1:03:52] gone but el shaddai is the almighty the
[1:03:54] strength giver and all abraham had to do
[1:03:57] to obtain this promise was lay right on
[1:04:00] that promise other words like the baby
[1:04:02] to its mother and nurse from the mother
[1:04:04] strength for the baby
[1:04:06] and we do the same thing when we come to
[1:04:07] god and see his promise we just lay
[1:04:10] right to him and draw from his word the
[1:04:12] strength of god
[1:04:13] given in its course not taking our own
[1:04:15] mind just believing in after he had
[1:04:18] endured he obtained the promise
[1:04:21] what's the secret
[1:04:23] just lay right to him when you see the
[1:04:25] promise in the word lay right to him and
[1:04:28] draw from his word the strength of god
[1:04:31] how do i get the strength to overcome it
[1:04:33] comes from the word friends
[1:04:35] it's the word that's been given to us
[1:04:36] amen the word has been unveiled amen
[1:04:39] there's life in that word and that word
[1:04:41] amen if you draw from that word and
[1:04:44] nurse from almighty god from the
[1:04:46] promised word you will draw strength
[1:04:48] from almighty god and that strength will
[1:04:51] be the performance of that word it's not
[1:04:54] what you and i do it's what he does
[1:04:56] through us amen but not through us as we
[1:04:59] run all over the place trying to find
[1:05:00] options but through us as we stay
[1:05:03] connected to him and draw from him alone
[1:05:06] then when our strength comes from him
[1:05:08] that strength performs its own word
[1:05:12] how does the baby grow tall how does the
[1:05:14] baby grow along how does the baby grow
[1:05:15] up how does the baby grow hair how does
[1:05:17] the baby grow teeth it just nurses
[1:05:19] that's all it does it just comes back to
[1:05:21] the one that birthed it and lays upon
[1:05:23] the bosom of mother and then comfort and
[1:05:26] satisfaction begins to draw life from
[1:05:28] mom and that life that comes from the
[1:05:30] one who gave it life that life is going
[1:05:33] to bring it into a fuller measure of
[1:05:35] life
[1:05:36] and the same thing's happening for us
[1:05:38] the one that birthed us the one that
[1:05:40] brought us here amen if we connect back
[1:05:42] to him his life is going to bring us
[1:05:44] into a fuller life amen
[1:05:47] to manifest his word
[1:05:50] so i want to look at some of these
[1:05:51] promises i want to send you home with a
[1:05:54] little list of promises
[1:05:56] because if you're looking for a place to
[1:05:58] draw life
[1:05:59] then the life comes from the word
[1:06:03] let's go to psalms 103.
[1:06:13] we're just going to flip through the
[1:06:14] bible a little bit
[1:06:16] psalms 103. you can jot these down and
[1:06:19] go over them and you can add to them
[1:06:21] because this is certainly not an
[1:06:22] exhaustive list this is a tiny list
[1:06:26] but psalms 103
[1:06:27] 2
[1:06:30] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[1:06:32] all his benefits

[1:06:37] healeth all thy diseases
[1:06:39] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:06:42] who crowneth thee with lovingkindness
[1:06:44] and tender mercies who satisfy us thy
[1:06:47] mouth with good things so that thy youth
[1:06:49] is renewed like the eagles that's what
[1:06:52] you get from el shaddai
[1:06:54] this is what comes to you nursing from
[1:06:56] el shaddai amen
[1:06:59] write this promise down and read this if
[1:07:01] you need it amen he's the one that
[1:07:04] forgives he's the one that uh forgiveth
[1:07:06] all thine iniquities he healeth all thy
[1:07:08] diseases amen he gives us life he fills
[1:07:12] our mouth with goodness he renews our
[1:07:14] strength like the eagles

[1:07:33] isaiah 53 5 but he was wounded for our
[1:07:36] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:07:38] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[1:07:41] peace is upon him and with his stripes
[1:07:43] we
[1:07:44] are healed
[1:07:46] that is still true and still worth
[1:07:48] quoting
[1:07:50] there is still life in this scripture
[1:07:52] there's still a promise of god laying
[1:07:54] here and we can still draw strength from
[1:07:57] this word strength for what strength for
[1:08:00] that word to come into manifestation

[1:14:15] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[1:14:18] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:14:21] casting all your care upon him
[1:14:23] for he
[1:14:24] careth for you
[1:14:26] this word casting means to throw upon
[1:14:30] to throw upon our place upon and he's
[1:14:33] actually telling us to throw
[1:14:35] all of your cares and this word care
[1:14:38] means care or anxiety
[1:14:41] whatever you're worried about
[1:14:43] whatever stressing you whatever is
[1:14:46] giving you anxiety he's telling you to
[1:14:48] throw or place upon him all of your
[1:14:51] anxieties and cares
[1:14:55] and it says
[1:14:56] casting throwing all of your anxiety
[1:14:58] upon him
[1:15:00] for he
[1:15:01] careth for you this word care is is to
[1:15:05] care about or to take care
[1:15:08] so cast all of your anxieties on him for
[1:15:12] he takes care for you
[1:15:15] you don't have to take care of it he'll
[1:15:17] take care of it you don't have to worry
[1:15:19] about it he's got it under control if we
[1:15:22] could learn to throw all of our cares
[1:15:24] and anxieties upon him because he takes
[1:15:27] care or cares for us amen he's made
[1:15:30] promises that this thing that you're
[1:15:32] going through will not destroy you he's
[1:15:34] made promises that this thing that
[1:15:35] you're going through will not finish you
[1:15:37] that he's with you in the midst of it
[1:15:39] that he'll not forsake you that you'll
[1:15:41] not be plucked out of his hand that your
[1:15:43] foot shall not slip that he won't go to
[1:15:45] sleep that he'll never forget about you
[1:15:47] and he'll be with you all the way to the
[1:15:49] end of the world amen he is actually
[1:15:51] caring for your cares if you'll just
[1:15:54] throw them on him

[1:15:58] your stresses throw it on him there's
[1:16:00] nothing in the world you can do about it
[1:16:02] anyways if there was something you can
[1:16:04] do about it you wouldn't be anxious for
[1:16:06] it amen if you could have fixed it you
[1:16:07] would no longer be under stress because
[1:16:09] you would have fixed it so the very fact
[1:16:11] that it's causing you stress and anxiety
[1:16:13] proves that you can't do anything about
[1:16:15] it you might as well cast it on him and
[1:16:18] let him do it and throw it upon him and
[1:16:20] go back to nursing from his promises and
[1:16:22] drawing strength from his word amen and

[1:16:54] fretting
[1:16:56] and nervous and anxious and worried and
