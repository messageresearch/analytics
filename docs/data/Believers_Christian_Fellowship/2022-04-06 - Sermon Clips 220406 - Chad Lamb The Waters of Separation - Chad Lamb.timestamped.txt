[0:00] so what is a filter used for a filter is
[0:04] used for purification
[0:06] so if you have a water filter amen a
[0:09] water filter is used to purify the water
[0:12] so if water passes through the filter
[0:14] the filter is there to collect anything
[0:16] that you don't want in the water so if
[0:18] you have a water filtration system at
[0:20] home or any kind of filtration system
[0:22] it's used for purification purification
[0:24] of air purification of water
[0:26] purification of any other
[0:28] fluid or whatever you have a filters for
[0:30] purification
[0:32] what was the waters of separation for
[0:34] purification
[0:36] so what is this all about that god has
[0:38] provided something that would purify his
[0:40] people amen and it's a water of
[0:43] separation to separate us from the world
[0:47] god has given us his word amen and we
[0:50] live in a day when it's not partial word
[0:52] partial understanding but it's the full
[0:54] revelation of the full word so there's
[0:56] been a pure filter restored to the
[0:58] people again a waters of separation that
[1:00] has come back to the church where we
[1:03] know that we can be clean
[1:05] it's no longer guessing there's no
[1:07] longer hoping i know i can be clean how
[1:09] can i be clean by surrendering to that
[1:12] word amen by just submitting to it and
[1:14] obeying it amen
[1:16] we make things so complicated sometimes
[1:19] that that i i how do i know i right i
[1:21] want to be right oh i wish i was right
[1:23] amen the devil can get us on i wish i
[1:25] was right merry-go-round and i hope that
[1:27] i'm right amen but there's one way that
[1:29] we know that we're right
[1:31] it's when we surrender to this word
[1:35] there are things that that that we may
[1:37] not know decisions that we have to make
[1:39] and and we labor over those we want to
[1:41] be in the will of god and we want to do
[1:43] right and we make the decision the best
[1:45] way we know how to make the decision
[1:47] but if we filtered it through the word
[1:51] if there's no word hindering us from
[1:54] stepping right or left we just have to
[1:56] go by the leading of the lord the way we
[1:57] feel is right to go and trust that god
[1:59] will help us if we're wrong
[2:02] but we ought not to have so much anxiety
[2:05] over those things because there's been a
[2:06] water of purification and as long as
[2:09] we're surrendering to the word with all
[2:11] that we know god will take care of the
[2:13] rest
[2:14] where we can be nervous where we should
[2:16] have anxiety and fear is when we know
[2:19] we're not right with the word when we
[2:21] know the prophet of god has taught the
[2:23] scriptures in a way taught the conduct
[2:25] of a believer in a way and we knowingly
[2:27] refuse to walk in them
[2:29] that's where we can be nervous that's
[2:31] where we can have anxiety
[2:33] but if we're doing all that we know to
[2:35] do trust the word to be the filter and
[2:37] trust it to be the waters of separation
