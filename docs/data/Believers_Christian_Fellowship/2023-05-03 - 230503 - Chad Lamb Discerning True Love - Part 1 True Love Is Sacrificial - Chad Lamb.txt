impartation of Life greater life more life more Abundant Life Lord is word by word comes forth may it Sprout bring forth a harvest in our lives may we be like you Lord God we're yielding ourselves to your hand we pray you take preeminence now Among Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and while you're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to First John chapter 4. are you doing that I'd like to welcome my friend brother Jiva rotner Marla Puti from India he's sitting right down here he came in for a few days to visit he should come in Monday and he's leaving unfortunately he's leaving tomorrow morning but we've had a good time of fellowship at the end of the service I'm going to ask him to come up and close an award of prayer just so he can greet you and then pray and pray at the dismissal and also want to remind you that this weekend will be the meetings with brother Abraham Myra Saturday and Sunday also there'll be a communion service with a fellowship dinner in between I just want to remind you of that I'm looking forward to that please remember to be praying for that amen and come with expectation amen well we're standing let's look at first John 4 verse 7. first John 4 and 7. beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love amen God bless you as you have your seeds I mean this is quite a scripture so it says beloved let's love one another for love is of God and then he ends up by saying God is love so God and love are one and the same everyone that loveth is born of God Amen so if you're able to love the way God loves then you're born of God Amen uh everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God so you're born of God and know God if you love like God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love so that really that really says a lot just in that one verse let's read Romans 5 5 together and then I'll start sharing with you my thought here uh Romans 5 chapter 5 chapter 5 verse 5. he says and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so he says if you're able to love then you're born of God and we know that this this love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost so the new birth brings us the love of God and God is love amen so so to to love like God is to be like God Amen and we know in this day in the stature of a perfect man that God has been building his church and bringing this church unto adoption into the statue of a perfect man and the capping off of that is charity is love amen is perfect love amen because God is love so what is God doing by showing the building of a statue of a perfect man and heading it up in love that is God himself amen bringing the church into the very likeness and image of God yeah to where when it's sealed and capped off and in full display amen it'll be displaying the very attributes in life of God that's why love is at the top amen and and for a title I'd like to title this Discerning true love Discerning true love and for a subtitle I like to put true love is sacrificial I don't know how far we'll we'll get into this as I started looking into this and meditating on it I've been meditating on it for several weeks now amen it just keeps blossoming so we might preach on this a little while but Discerning true love so we want to be able to serve true love we want to be able to discern it in ourselves and in others Discerning true love true love is sacrificial so it's the first part we want to look at and the message adore to the heart brother bear says what is God God is love he that loveth is of God now that isn't what we call free love that's agape love there's two different kinds of love one of them is the Greek word filio filio means friendship the kind you have for your wife love that kind of love that kind of love is not a true love oh boy that's amazing isn't it that kind of love is not a true love brother but I'm saying the kind of love that you have amen the emotional passionate kind of love is not a true love it's a human love it's an emotional love the kind that you have for your wife amen it that's that kind of love is not a true love oh I know you little teenagers want to believe that but it's wrong remember how many I I don't know how many of you experienced it but little teenage love and crushes and oh my goodness this person's the greatest this girl is it this guy is it amen and after a while you don't even like him anymore that wasn't love amen that was a feeling amen and the feeling faded but true love is not a feeling it's not based upon emotion it's something greater than that amen so that kind of love is not a true love the kind of that kind of love will make you jealous of your wife you'll take a pistol and blow a man's brains out because of her that ain't real love that's filio love but agape love will make you get down and pray for that man's lost soul that's agapio love that's the kind of love that the church needs what we all need is that kind of love God give me that love I'd rather have that experience of love than have all the gifts that God's got in his heaven because if you've got that kind of love you've got God because God Is This Love they're equal they're one and the same and so we want to talk about uh Discerning true love versus this false love or this that what brother said is not a true love and when we look up these two words there's a word study I've read this before to you several times out of uh the the concordance out of the Scofield uh not Schofield Strong's Concordance and there's a little write-up when you compare these two words and it's and it's a write-up from a German scholar a named Richard Linsky and he's in this is a statement I pulled out of that said the verb agapan that's where we get Agape or agapeon Love Is the Love of intelligence reason and comprehension coupled with the corresponding purpose in its content it is vastly outranks the other type of love and Fillion expresses the love of mere personal affection or liking including even the passions where the context requires and no intelligence or high purposes involved this is exactly what brother Ben is telling us in all in so many quotes he's telling us the difference between these two loves but it's articulated really well here he said he says so this filial love is mere personal affection or liking including even the passions where the context requires with no intelligence or high purpose involved it's just merely a reaction amen it's an emotional love and it goes on to say this content places the verb on a low level it could never be said of God that he Philly I the sinful word as far as Fillion is concerned he could only abominate the foul world Jesus never asked us to love our enemies in this sense of feeling he never asked us to love our enemies with a passionate loving feeling love for our enemies that wasn't the kind of love he wanted us to have a higher love to love the way he loves that's beyond emotion because my emotion can be all troubled about an enemy amen but there's a greater love than emotion that's higher than emotion that has intellect understanding that understands the plan of God that's the kind of love where Jesus could look nailed to a cross Upon A people who were wagging their heads and mocking him and saying father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's true love so God never said he loved the world with a with a great emotional feeling he loved the world with a higher love than that he didn't ask us to love our enemies with that kind of weak love but with God's love then it goes on to say yes with this love did God love the world and we can love our enemies comprehending all that is wrong sanctifying the world converting our enemies compare John 3 16 and every other passage in which either of the verbs is used in the gospel only in a few cases where either type of Love would apply either verb might be used but even then the great distinction would remain the two are never equal this is what brother Brown tells us over and over and over when he begins to explain amen how your your filio love your emotional love your human love for a spouse will create a jealousy that would make you angry at a man who desire to kill them or harm them and or I mean if if there's anybody you want to hit strike speak evil again then then that's not the love of God but then brother van said but this kind of love God's love the agape love will cause you to pray for that man's soul that he'll be converted forgiven so now we want to discern true love and we want to look that the subtitle true love is sacrificial this is how we'll begin to discern true love because true love is sacrificial in Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Ben says now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed and Brethren him in this message and in others he's telling us that God Amen knew there would be a fall amen and in knowing there would be a fall amen there was attributes within God that God wanted to express and he could only express a Healer if somebody was sick he could only express a savior if somebody was lost amen so God Amen he allowed this this plan he allowed the fall to take place amen because it would set the backdrop that he needed to display his fullness amen so the backdrop of the Fall the fall provides the backdrop for God to display What Love Is because of the Fall we can understand love men because of the Fall we can understand salvation because of the Fall we can understand Redemption because of the Fall we can understand Deliverance because of the Fall we can understand healing but because of the Fall we can understand love it's a it's the backdrop for God's Great art for the display of God's attributes amen is this fall so then we look at John 3 16. John 3 16 said for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so God when God loves he gives God's love was a sacrificial love when God loved he gave his only begotten son and we know that only begotten son was God himself dwelling in a body of Flesh to pay the price of redemption himself so God's love God the the the the the the true love was a sacrificial love of the one who was doing the loving who was sacrificed to love her in Galatians 2 20. he says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me how do you know he loved you because he gave himself for you that that's the evidence of his love amen because we're going to start seeing true love I mean how do we discern true love amen there's so many things people say they love you and they love this and they love that and they love all everything how are we going to discern what's true love how are we going to even judge ourselves what we're really loving remember the first step is true love is sacrificial let's look at Second Corinthians 8 together let's go there together I got several scriptures I want to turn to and there is so there's hundreds literally hundreds of scriptures we could read on this but I just pulled one here and there just to paint a picture and maybe we'll grab more of them as we go on and preaching this but for tonight we're just going to grab a few in second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 9. in verse 9 he says for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that he through his poverty might be rich This Is Love This Is Love that he came down so you could go up that he but he he he gave up richness for poverty so that you could have richness he gave up life he sacrificed his life to take death to taste death so that you don't have to live and under the curse of death so that you can taste life his love is sacrificial and and here we can begin to see the difference between the love true love versus false love true love is sacrificial false love is self-love false love always holds self at the center of love and even if there's an object of love I hope I can explain this true love versus this not true love I want to call it a false love but only the eyes of God's a false love it's a true human love to genuine emotional human love but it's not the true love of God amen but this this this human love always holds self at the center of love because even if there's an object that this love is directed towards that object that this love is being showered on it only is receiving the love because of the benefit to the lover yes yes because of a way that makes the lover feel the way that it makes the lover the enthusiasm the excitement the passion amen whatever amen whatever this love is directed towards it's directed that way because amen of a self-love so it looks like love is given amen but really amen it's a self-love but not so with true love with true love amen the the love is directed to the recipient of love amen and that's who the love is for amen brother Brown says in the thyatarian church age in the church age book he said I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last day that because of the of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the laodice in her last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God so what will take the place of the true love of God self-love this is the false love and the love of material things amen so God is setting for us an example and in this example now he because of the Fall it gives God the opportunity to come and demonstrate true love so that we now know what love is and now amen now we can go and repeat that and replicate love now we know how to act in love because this is how love Acts let's go to Ephesians chapter 5. Ephesians 5 and 25. Ephesians 5 25 says husbands love your wives even as Christ also love the church and gave himself for it so now he's telling husbands now you replicate This Love now you repeat now you love your wives now he's saying love your wife not just with merely a passion and an emotion and a feeling but you love your life the way Christ loved the church and gave himself forward the evidence of a true love for wife is a self-sacrificing love where the husband sacrifices himself for her that's love that's genuine true love amen that's why selfishness in marriage is a curse amen it's the destruction of marriage when you find divorce in marriage if you trace it back you will always find selfishness because true love is sacrificial and you have two people sacrificing for one another and preferring one another over themselves you're not going to have a broken home or a broken marriage if you're struggling in marriage somebody's being selfish amen so so it's the wrong kind of love now brother Franco if you could pull up the white board I want to write something down quickly before we move on because I want to write down two little phrases and I want to hold it on the Whiteboard and hold it in our minds and hopefully you'll be able to read my writing but I'll read to you what I write so that you know what I wrote and hopefully you get time to write it down yourselves so first I want to I want to contrast True Love with a perverted love now we know Humanity has been perverted the spirit we have is a carnal Spirit our flesh is hybrid amen our human love is a perverted love but God's love is a true love so I want to say like this true love hope I got this right true love will sacrifice the lover for the benefit of the loved amen that's genuine true Godly love that's the love that God demonstrated for us true love will sacrifice the lover the one who's giving the love will sacrifice the lover for the benefit of the loved so you can probably already guess what perverted love is perverted love will sacrifice who it'll sacrifice the loved for the benefit of the lover this is a perverted love this is the kind of love most of the world has a perverted love will sacrifice the loved the one I'm directing my love to for the benefit of the one who's giving life that's a perverted love but the world is full of this love and the genuine love of God is very rare amen which is a sacrificial love amen I want to look at just a couple examples in the Bible just I want to contrast this and then go forward let's go to second Samuel together there is example after example after example in the Bible but I just want to grab these two really quickly second Samuel chapter 13. second Samuel chapter 13 verse 1. it came to pass after this that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar and amnon the son of David loved her so amnon and Absalom have different mothers but same Father David amnon is in love with Tamar all right in verse two and amnon was very vexed that fell sick for his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her Ben amnon had a friend whose name was Jonah dab the son of shimmyi David's brother and Jonah dad was a very subtle man and he said unto him why art thou being the King's son lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him I love Tamar my brother absalom's sister and Jonah dab said unto him lay thee down on the bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee saying to him I pray that he let my sister Tamar come and give me Meep and dress the meat in my sight and I may see it and eat it at her hand so now this subtle friend amen who he comes up with a plan where he can lure Tamar into his into his Abode into his home and into his bed chamber amen because he says I love Tamar so he loves Tamar but we're going to find out whether he was a genuine true love or a false love but he claims that he loves her let's go over to verse 11. it says and when she had brought them into him to eat brought some cake she had baked into him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister and she answered him name my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in Israel do not thou this Folly and I wither shall I cause my shame to go how will the shame go away from me and as for thee Thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel now therefore I pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee albeit he would not hearken under her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her then amnon hated her exceedingly he just said he loved her now he got what he he got what he loved he said he loved her but who did he really love himself and as soon as himself got what he loved now he hated her so he never loved her he only loved himself now this is what he says that what goes on then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and amnon said unto her arise and be gone and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou did to me but he would not hearken unto her then he called his servant that ministered to him and said put now this woman out for me and Bolt the door after her this man never had one drop of true love for her he had a passionate lustful desire and he called it love and that's what the world operates on it amen am I not just sexual but lustful in all kinds of lustful ways amen lust for advancement lust for money Lust For popularity Lust For Whatever amen and and it's driving love but it's the false kind of love and this love doesn't love the recipient this love though it showered upon somebody this love is only for the lover not for the recipient and amnon he did something so wicked and so evil and and and Tamar said don't do this thing she begins to implore him and says speak to the king he will not withhold thee from me amen there was there's even a proper way to go about this but he didn't want it he was so impassioned that he forced his sister and immediately he now hated her and she she said don't send me away for that would be worse than what you did before but he wouldn't hear her because he didn't love her now this is a perfect example of what we wrote down here true love will sacrifice the lover for the benefit of the love but a perverted love will sacrifice the love for the benefit of the lover does this make sense so now we see this happens all the time amen young women fall prey to this over and over and over and over because a man will shower affection say he loves you write poetry about you and all of this amen and really what he loves is himself but what he wants is he wants to touch you he wants the feeling that he feels around you he's excited amen and any man any man who will take away your virginity loves himself more than he loves you because if he loved you with the true Godly love amen he would sacrifice his passions for you amen amen but when he sacrifices you for his passions it shows he's not come to the right level of love right and so we say God help us die to the false perverted love and have the true love this is God this comes from the Devil amen so we see this story in Tamar so this is I mean this plays out over and over and over and over again in the day and age we live in I'm not just talking sexual dishes plays out all the time amen you know how many times you you is anybody ever don't raise your hands but this is just is anybody here ever been manipulated by somebody yes and they'll act like your friend I guess you oh yes you don't have to raise your hand still follows instructions somebody will feign to be a friend and to love you because they want some information it's funny how often when a when a young girl or a young boy is interested in another one all of a sudden they become good friends with their brother or sister of the one they're interested in and also their best buds and then it all comes out you really like my sister you really like my brother and then we'll find out whether it's a true lover or not if it continues on after you get the brother after you get the sister I mean that's childish teenage things that happen but it happens to adults too where somebody will feign to love you Fame to be a friend and what they want is a piece of information or they want a position or they want to get closer to something or learn something or obtain something and then after a while when it works out or does it work out then they abandon the friendship and all the love and all the text and all the phone calls and all the attention that you got you don't get anymore because this person never really had a genuine love for you they had a perverted love because there was something they were looking to gain out of the relationship and when they gained it or failed to gain it they dumped the relationship because they never really loved you right so we have lived through this all of us have lived through this because we live in a fallen world but this is how we discern life no matter how often somebody says I love you I love you I love you amen if they never sacrifice for you they don't love you if there's no sacrifice for the object of their love it's not a true love amen if all they ever do is say I love you I love you I love you and they they sacrifice the one they're loving and continually Rob from them for themselves that is a perverted love and not God's love and you can discern it right off the bat but it's so confusing in the emotional Realms and you get so entangled emotionally into things amen when we just look at God's love and back up a little bit and say is this how God loves or is this how the devil manipulates people with emotion amen then we can begin to discern love let's look at First Kings chapter 3. we know the story well we're not going to read the whole thing we're just going to read a few verses here First Kings chapter 3. that's why I say I'm on timeout I'm not reading this yet don't read ahead please you'll you'll hurt my feelings all kinds of ways but young sisters if that young brother wants to court she wants to talk to you and he is constantly pushing the boundaries Beyond where you're comfortable and violating the Commandment of your father I would question whether he loves you or not because if he's got a Godly love for you he will be able to sacrifice himself regardless of how impassioned he is he will sacrifice himself for you if he's got a Godly love for you all right and so I would let that be a judge I mean I if if somebody's trying to constantly circumvent the boundary and constantly push the lines and and wants to touch you and you don't want to be touched and wants to have a private conversation when you're not ready to have a private conversation or whatever is happening amen and you ask him not to and they continue to do it or your father told them not that they continue to do it I would I would look at that and say this person says they love me they write nice poems about me they sung me a beautiful song but they don't love me and I'm telling you if they if they do that to you in courtship your marriage is not going to be pleasant because you're going to enter into a marriage with somebody that loves themselves more than they love you and you're going to have a horrible marriage amen amen so so we need to discern love we need to discern love so now we're in the First Kings chapter 3 verse 16. all right King Solomon the wisest King that Israel knew until Christ Jesus he says and then came there are two women that were harlots into the king and stood before him and the one woman said oh my Lord I and this woman dwell in one house and I was delivered of a child with her in the house and it came to pass the third day after I was delivered that this woman was delivered also we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save me we too in the house and This Woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thy handmaid slept and laid it in the bosom and later dead child in my bosom then in front of Sodom and he began to argue back and forth no it's my child no it's my child I know it's my child so Solomon with discernment he comes down here we'll drop down to verse 24. and the King said bring me a sword and they brought a sword before the king and the King said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other then speak the woman who the living child was and to the king for her bows yearned upon her son and she said oh my Lord give her the living child and in no I slay it but the other said Let It Be neither mine nor thine but divide it then the king answered and said give her the living child and know why slay it she is the mother thereof this this wise Solomon with discernment he recognized right off the one that was willing to sacrifice herself for the object of love was the True Mother had the natural affection the other didn't have the natural affection she says divide it let it be neither mind nor her amen so so so even in the natural realm Solomon was able to discern the natural affection of a mother amen because she was able to sacrifice amen I say God help us to have God's love and let it be demonstrated in my life that I have a love that will sacrifice that will well I will sacrifice myself for the object of my love amen that's why children get so messed up when they're not loved in this kind of love when they're constantly manipulated when they're constantly pressured to perform when a mother or a father amen when a mother or a father is pushing their child to make some sort of achievement or goal because the parents are now proud of my son's academic scholarship or prowess on the football field or they can hit a ball and we push them Beyond where they want to be push them I've seen kids pushed until because I grew up in Little League Men playing little league ball parents yelling at their kids at the car why didn't you get that why didn't you make that play we practiced that before and putting a ton of pressure on this kid you think why it's little league baseball because the Dad loved himself more than he loved this boy because the dad when the boy hit the Home Run That's my boy I taught him hey Manny chip off the old block just like his dad and now dad is living through the Sun and gaining some sort of notoriety some sort of something amen the dad amen has not sacrificed himself for the love of that boy he's sacrificing the object of his love for himself mom will do it too by dressing up her girl and making her the prettiest and posting stuff on social media amen why because Mom's living through the girl amen it sounds like it's far away but it creeps in pretty close amen I want the spirit of discernment to say that's not right amen that's not what I want amen I want to take all the hits for my kids I want to stand in the front and absorb it all and let them go like that's all right son you'll get them next time because I don't want to sacrifice the ones I love amen I want to sacrifice myself for the ones I love right so when kids grow up they're not able to put their finger on what the problem is that the children and spouses and the individuals and organizations and groups of people they're not able to discern it's so confusing because of the words and the emotions and it gets all tangled up amen they're not able to what is this that makes me feel so filthy when I'm when I'm encountered this person why do I feel so terrible after this they say they love me but I feel horrible when a when a mother or father gets up in age and they keep putting pressure on their kids you never call me you never come and see me you never you never you never Hey listen it's a that's a form of manipulation trying to get your kids to make you feel good about yourself and the kids want to stay away and don't know why because Mom's saying I love you so much and I miss you so bad and then laying guilt trips on you that's not true love true love gives first gives most gives when nothing's in return that's God's love God gave when when when when when nobody had to give back God gave when nobody can match what he gave he gave the most he gave the best he gave first and he gave without a guarantee of return that's true love anything else amen begins to manipulate is a perverted love and holds the lover as the center of their love so now we can begin to discern ourselves yes and discern the people around us and discern why they say they love me but I don't feel it all the words are good but the actions don't match the words and now we've suffered and struggled under these things for years and it gets all twisted up and then you've got a manipulated manipulative family member you know what it's like to be all twisted up emotionally and not able to discern what is this that's so ah I want to get away from them but I love them and they love me but I can't stand to be around them and every time they call I don't want to answer the call [Music] if we want people to love us then we need the love of God should have brought in our hearts and we need to give love when there's not a promise of it returning amen we need to give more than they're able to give back we need to give because when God gave that way what did God get God got a love slave and Paul Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ Bound by chains of love not by laws not by rules but but Paul by love because God loved him first God loved him most God loved him when he was unlovable now Paul loved God back and what God got from Paul was a devotion was was his whole life his whole heart he got what did God get God got back what he gave and if we want people to love us our children and other ones we have to give this kind of love then when we give that love amen it unlocks something in the recipient so that they can give that kind of Love Back God unlocked love for you and I so that we could receive his spirit and we could love him back the right way there's also an emotional kind of love for God where people say I love God I love God I love God Amen but they won't do the simple things that God said do and it shows that there's no love because although you say you love God Amen you love The God Who heals you you love The God Who blesses you you love The God Who Died For You amen that's a self-centered love and all of those things are true he loved me he died for me amen I love him so much but if I love him so much and I won't do what he asked me to do it shows that I am not offering to him a sacrificial love because my love to God must also be a sacrificial love not just asking God to sacrifice you die for me you deliver me you heal me you heal me but when God says do this and don't do that now I'm willing to die to myself because my love for him that I will sacrifice me for the object of my love I will sacrifice my idea my want my desire My Passion I'll lay it on the altar because I love him see it goes both ways people claim they love God write songs about love and God sing about loving God but their actions prove they love themselves let's go to first John 4 17. first John 4 17. verse 19. we love him because he first loved us If any man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love with his brother also so we see that we love God we love him because he first love up loved us let's back up to verse 17 and catch some of this ahead of this herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in the world amen there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love so perfect love takes away fear when God demonstrated this kind of love amen he gave us the ability to break free from Fear because God demonstrated his love while we were yet unlovable and then you see yourself as the objects of God's love and you see God he never asked you to sacrifice for his love he said because I love you I will sacrifice myself for for because I love you amen God's not saying I love you see if you can do it better I love you come and get my love I love you see if you can get up here and be worthy of my love that's not love but he proved that he loved us when he made himself a sacrifice to take our sin on him and all of our iniquities and sin and shame was placed on him and he became his own sacrifice and he sacrificed for his love all right so that we could go free so now what kind of love do I give him if I'm going to give him a true genuine love it must also be sacrificial love amen praise God not just asking God to sacrifice for me but me willing to sacrifice for him John 14 15 Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments Jesus is not saying if you keep my Commandments I'll love you Jesus already said he loved them he already proved that he loved them and God's love now is not in question God's just now showing you a discernment for your love if you love me keep my Commandments because why if you keep your Commandments it requires death to self if you live in the flesh and sacrificing yourself shows that you really do love God this is what this is what Saul could not do Saul was anointed to be king amen but Saul could not sacrifice himself to keep the Commandments he kept failing in the Commandments amen and there was a time that Samuel was going to come to him to offer a sacrifice and after seven days Samuel didn't show up amen and he had him bring a sacrifice and he slayed the sacrifice himself and immediately when he's done Samuel shows up and this is in the book of First Samuel 13. and he says what have you done he says I saw that you delayed in coming I saw that the people were far from me and I was afraid that the Philistines would come and listen all of that has to do with Saul the people were far from me I wanted to draw the people to me Philistines were coming after me I was afraid to lose the battle you hadn't come to me me me me me me me so I was forced to do this contrary to the Commandment to preserve myself that's when that's when Samuel said the kingdom will be rent from you given to a better God will choose a man after his own heart which is David what made David after his own heart it wasn't that David would never fail because David's failures would be equal sometimes to the failures of Saul terrible failures but there was a difference between David and Saul if you contrast these two Saul loved himself more than he loved God David loved God more than he loved himself and even in David's failures when when when the prophet would come and call him out he would say I sinned amen he would repent he would lay on his face amen he he would deny himself for the word of God and when he failed to deny himself he would repent Saul never really repented he was just sorry for the consequences so uh I want to look at this in in first Samuel 15 let's turn together and just look at this for just a second remember we're Discerning true love and we want the word to discern us and discern the situations around us brother Branham says in the message Christ is revealed on his own word but the Christian the church what I'm talking to this morning the law of God is in your heart you have no desire to do it inside here you want to keep God's law so perfect no matter what it is you want to be just what if God needs a doormat at the door he wants you to be that doorman Norman you're so happy to be that he's talking about genuine love the love of God in your heart if God wants you to be a doormat you're not going to ask him to make you a singer or make you a songwriter or make you a deacon or a preacher if God says I want you to be a doormat that's what you want to be that's true love he said whatever God wants you to do that's what you want to do because it's God now that's where you really find your real genuine true love for God now let's look at first Samuel 15 24. and Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice this looks like a repentance but it's not a repentance now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord and Samuel said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou has rejected the word of the Lord and the lord of the rejected thee from being King over Israel let's go down to verse 30. then he said I have sinned yet honor me now I pray thee before the Elders of my people and before Israel and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord thy God this is no genuine love of God and true repentance amen this is a man who wants to save face in front of the elders amen and still wants to look good and hold his position says Saul loves himself but David has a different nature this reminds me in Matthew 23 verse 5 Jesus is speaking now the Pharisees he says but all their Works they do for to be seen of men they make broader phylacteries they enlarge the borders of their garments they love the uppermost rooms that feast in the chief seats and the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called meant by of men Rabbi Rabbi these men look like they love God but they really love themselves and they go through all of these uh rituals and all of these laws and all of this stuff so that they can prove to the people that they love God but really Jesus is Discerning their love they don't love God they love themselves they love the position it puts them in the esteem that they get from people in the respect that's what they're loving and unfortunately and sadly this is what religion is really like people are religious for all kinds of reasons amen but the number one reason for religion is that people love themselves because it serves them somehow their religion is serving them somehow and whatever they get out of it amen either clear from a guilty conscience or respect from somebody or love from a family member whatever reason they'll dive into religion Amen in this religion amen looks like they love God but really they love themselves true yeah this is why no matter how much you show the truth of the word to people they won't leave their religion because the relief the religion would cause a personal sacrifice they would have to sacrifice themselves to leave their tradition and in leaving the tradition they would lose Association they would lose respect they would look bad in the eyes of people they would look like a heretic or you're following a false prophet or or you're mixed up with a cult you're you're this you're that you're the other and people won't leave the religion because the religion is serving self no matter how much you show baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right out of the word no matter how much you show them amen that the trinitarian idea is wrong no matter how much you show by the word they can see it amen they will agree with you and then when they go to their Pastor or go to their church and they're going to be rejected for that word they reject the word and stay with the religion perverted love and God was a perverted love but a pure love would say if that's the truth if that's the truth if that's what God Said Amen if that's what God wants and that's what God requires where can I get baptized amen all friends forsake you your church think you've gone off the deep end they no longer consider you a Christian they are no longer consider you in the way of Truth they've lost respect for co-workers lose respect but it doesn't matter because the recipient of my love is worth my personal sacrifice it's worth me losing my reputation losing my Association losing everything because the recipient of my love is worth My Sacrifice but if we're not willing to become the sacrifice then we don't love the object of our love we love ourselves it's Boomerang love I only give love because I want love praise God Amen so we see David had a different nature because of first Samuel 24 I just want to look at this quickly very briefly just pull out one nugget here first Samuel 24 and to set the stage David is running from place to place from stronghold to stronghold and hide out The Hideout because Saul is chasing after him to kill him because he knows God is with him David has done nothing against Saul but Saul hates David because Saul loves himself and David is a threat to himself and because he loves himself more than anybody in the world when David now is a threat to him he has to kill David to preserve his self-love Saul has no sacrificial love now David's in a cave Saul comes in lays himself down all of all of David's buddies are saying get him get him the Lord has delivered him into your hands but in first Samuel 24 verse 4 here's what it says and the men of David said unto him behold the day which the Lord said unto thee behold I will deliver thine enemy unto thine hand that thou mayest due to him as it shall seem good unto thee then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately and Saul was asleep he just went over there and he cut around the Hem of a skirt just a piece and it came to pass afterward that David's heart smote him because he had cut off Saul skirt and he said unto his men the Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master the Lord's anointed to stretch forth mine hand against him seeing he is Anointed of the Lord this man Saul was wrong he was wrong in every way he was trying to kill David David had done nothing wrong he had deceived David he had manipulated David he had tried to trick David he had done all kinds of things he was wrong in every way but but but David was not looking to the right and wrong of Saul he was looking above Saul to the god that had placed Saul there and that the anointing oil had poured over him and he said if God wants him there what right do I have to remove him right well right this should put fear in the hearts of people who want to split churches amen because if God will let it stand let it stand if God will let that Ministry stand no matter how wrong it is if God lets us stand let it stand don't go in there and break the thing up and split it up because if God's place it there to serve whatever purpose don't be found fighting against God no matter how wrong it is do you have to leave leave but don't break the thing up let God do it amen amen and this is what David David wasn't looking Saul hated him Saul became his enemy David had done nothing wrong to Saul when he when he cut the Hem of a skirt amen all of a sudden his heart smote him not because Saul was so sweet and loving and kind and he felt bad no he said how dare I touch the Lord's anointed amen this is what God has done now I'll be find myself against God and though he was mistreated he subjected himself to God's way when it came time for a change God made the change but David wasn't going to do it to save himself if he would have saw his life it seemingly would have been easier his troubles would have went away he was supposed to be King Saul was wrong he was right but he wouldn't go against God see that shows David had a another heart he was after God's Own Heart amen you know even listen even Michael when they were disputing over the body of Moses even the Archangel he told Satan he told Lucifer Satan he says he says the Lord deal with Thee he wouldn't even bring a railing accusation if God allowed this being to continue on not even Michael was going to make her bring a railing accusation it's amazing to me David's heart towards God and so so now the ability to sacrifice ourselves to the desire of God proves our love to God not not just works not legalism it's not just Pharisees they had that down and Jesus saw right through it all the works all the all the works all the great things they did they did it for show they did it to be seen they did it for some selfish reason some self-love reason and Jesus saw right through it not legalism but a real love of God that says if that's what God likes that's what I'll do brother Graham says in the thy entire church age I know your love service faith and patience you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service The Works are not accepted Without Love if we if we do the works with the wrong motive it's not accepted because we do it for ourselves to be seen of men or whatever reason amen but with love with genuine Godly love amen we serve God and sacrifice ourselves then our works are accepted so without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service Paul's speaking to Corinthians said with without love I am nothing and whatever I do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that nicolaitan class that did works as a means of Salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost that love in their hearts was God's love for his own Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have loved one for another the pagans who saw the lives of the early Christians says behold how they love each other listen the love that they had for each other was their love for God and it was God's love for his own it was the love of God she had abroad in their hearts this wasn't a human filial love the love of the Brethren isn't an emotional love it's got to go beyond an emotional love because your brother may not always be lovable it's got to be the love of God shed abroad in our hearts extended to our Brethren yes let's look at first John chapter 3 together first John chapter 3 verse 14. if I can find it first John chapter 3. verse 14. we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the brethren look at this we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we love the brethren not Ophelia love but a true love we know that we have passed from Death in life because we love the Brethren this is why when you get mad at everybody around you and refuse to talk to all the Brethren and pull yourself away and I wonder what kind of love that is what made you mad you know your feelings hurt is that the love of God that's self-love I mean it's raw this is raw but it's right down to where we live amen they hurt my feelings they mistreated me they spoke about me I can't even go to that church I pull myself away I'm all by myself that's not the love of God the love of God will sacrifice self for others amen so the love of the Brethren is the love of God shed abroad in our hearts amen all right let's keep reading verse 14 we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth and death whosoever hate is his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath in eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren lay down our lives lay down hurt feelings misunderstandings this is the Bible straightforward raw hitting us all between the eyes this is life this is the love of God brother Branham says and dear God I've just tried to speak of love that you gave to your church it seems like that they've got caught up in the Miracles of the Bible they've caught up in the membership and the evangelism and the missionaries but Lord let them catch up with love now that'll set the church a fire with a real Agape of love with a real sacred love that could turn the cheek or the one that would be willing to lay down his life it would if it would mean to save others God give us that love in our hearts as we wait on me the Apostle Paul says he says my heart Bears witness that I have a great yearning in my heart that I would be accursed from Christ for the sake of my brother and the Jews that was the love of God in the Apostle Paul that wasn't human that was gone um amen let's look at John the Gospel of John John chapter 15. he's got a couple more scriptures I want to lay in and then we'll leave this subject for tonight John 15 verse 12. he said John 15 12. this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you how did Jesus love them was it an emotional love or agape love was it a love of personal sacrifice was it a love he endured a lot of things Jesus had to put up with a lot of immaturity in his disciples but he loved them because he had a higher life all right let's keep reading where am I John 15 12. this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this than a man laid down his life for his friends Year my friends if you do whatsoever I command you amen no greater love has any man than this that he laid down his life for his friends why that's genuine love a sacrificial love Jesus said to the to the Pharisees in Luke 11 46 he says and he said woe unto you also you lawyers for you laid men with burdens Grievous to be born and ye yourselves touch not the burns with one of your fingers he says woe unto you you you you pack on extra traditions and extra rules and all of these things but you don't do anything to help your brethren amen that was the opposite of the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul says I become all things to all that I might win some to the weak I become weak to the Jew I become Jew to the Gentile amen Paul was willing to lower himself not to add Burns he was willing to bear under their burdens because he had genuine love amen though the law though the the word gave him a right to collect tithe he would forego that in a new place so that he would not disrupt their faith and he would work with his own hands to support himself he had a right to the tithe but he didn't exercise his right because he loved them that was genuine love he wasn't making the object of his love serve him he was sacrificing himself to serve the object of his love man and you know what happened those that he loved and Macedonia they would cover because he loved them with a sacrificial love they were now returning his love with a sacrificial love and he never demanded it they gave it willingly amen love genuine love reciprocates we love him because he first loved us and when he loved us with a pure love he unlocked something in Us by the new birth that we can love him back amen with the pure love and when we love our brother and they can love us back amen when we sacrifice ourselves they can sacrifice themselves and this comes all the way down to their home when Mom and Dad can sacrifice themselves for their children you can find children who can sacrifice themselves for Mommy praise God when Mom and Dad are always sacrificing their children for themselves always putting the children out putting the children last making the children away doing for themselves and not for others being inconsiderate when you have parents who don't sacrifice themselves for their kids later in life you'll have kids who won't sacrifice themselves for their parents and these are the people who die alone in nursing homes but if we will pour ourselves out God will see to it that somebody else will pour themselves you don't get by demand you get by love you don't receive by manipulation that'll never work you may threaten you may deceive it may work in a while but there's no genuine love there there's guilt there's shame and mixed in there's frustration and anger and bitterness who wants a family like that who wants a church like that who wants a marriage like that nobody amen so how do we beat that I die and the ones that I love receive a sacrificial love amen and maybe I can unlock something in them that they can love me back when when when what Mom and Dad want always take take away what the kids want when they see no sacrifice when they see no love when they see no that's why Mom will call up later and say you never see me you never call me you never she's still demanding that the one she loves serve her say God give us a genuine sacrificial love that will unlock love and the people around us the world needs this kind of love they've not they so seldom seen him Paul the Apostle Paul said for we are glad it's a second II Corinthians 13 9 we are glad when we are weak and you are strong in this also we wish even your perfection Paul says I'm glad when I'm weak and you're strong he was willing to sacrifice himself for them brother Ben said this isn't the message of man running from the presence of the Lord he said when John the Apostle John he got so old up into his 90s he was too old to preach anymore he begins to tell us I love this he says as John of old when he got too old to preach he would just sit and scream they tell me with all of his my little children love one another love one another don't let nothing come among you see what was John's last message the last of the apostles who had seen the Revelation he had seen amen the heavens opened he had went into the other dimension he had seen all the way through to the new heavens and new earth he'd seen the culmination of redemption amen and when he gets down there's only one message he's got left little children love one another brother bam said nothing will enter in there but pure love divine love because God is first John 4 20 says if any man says I love God and hated the brother he's a liar we have to if you love God we love our brothers but I want to finish with this verse Matthew chapter 5. Matthew chapter 5 verse 43. Matthew chapter 5 verse 43 you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans do the same if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect not just the brethren but to do good to love why I I want to read this one part of this verse again as we finish let's start back in verse 44. saying you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven why because this is how he loves this is how he loves and this is how he wants us to love and the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost I say God shed it more in my heart and More in my heart and let every other kind of love die inside of me so that this genuine sacrificial love will live there was a story I heard several years ago of a woman and this woman was had a little boy and this little boy was very very sick and the doctors could never find out what was wrong with it and the mother was posting on Facebook and posting on other social media forums and she was getting a lot of attention and a lot of people were posting back and giving support and she started a Blog and the blog was in the name of her son's journey so-and-so's journey and she was blogging this and doing videos and updates and and she was going around and and over the course of this child's life in the first five years she had taken it to 20 over 20 different medical facilities and finally the child died at five and they found out that this woman had been slowly poisoning her child to keep him sick because she loved the attention from his illness because she loved the feedback on social media she felt good when people cared it made her feel good when somebody responded when so many people watched her blog when they did this when they cared when they came to her that is a perverted love that's an extreme but we see mild forms of this all the time mild forms of that same extreme we see it all the time we see it in the Bible in Saul when Saul wanted a victory over the Philistines and when when the Philistines were routed because of the work that Jonathan and armored Bearer had done amen he then makes a decree he says nobody will touch food today we will fast because he was trying to ensure a victory and in doing though he troubled all of Israel because the soldiers were asked to go out and fight with no food they couldn't go up on the spoil they couldn't put anything to their mouth remember even Jonathan touched the end of his staff and honey and put it to his mouth because he didn't hear and they told him what happened he said my father has troubled all of Israel see how my eyes are lying if Saul would have loved the people more than he loved himself he would let the people eat but he wanted to ensure that God had to give him a victory and he would trouble all of the people for himself when fathers do that it's evil when ministers do that it's evil amen When anybody else when parents do that it's evil troubling people putting burdens on making requirements amen so that they can ensure for themselves victories or to look good or somehow have a status that's wickedness as perverted love but genuine love amen goes to the front of the battle and says amen what was it uh Van Winkle read amen there and Switzerland amen when he had all of his home and all of his family and everything that he loved behind him and there was an Army here that couldn't possibly be defeat he said he would become an example to encourage everybody and he said follow me boys and he ran into the thickest of the Spears and grabbed his many in his arms as he can and thrust him through him side and it so shocked the army of it is active sacrificial love so inspired amen all of his countrymen that they thwarted that army that day that's love but to sit at home smoke a cigar and send your 18 year old off the war that's not love it happens all around us all the time what's called love Isn't Love but what is true love sacrificial love that's true let's all stand it's not putting The Birds musicians please come it's not perting the burdens on others to make ourselves look good it's taking the burdens upon ourselves to ease the burden of another so that they can go free it's bearing their shame it's walking alongside them it's maybe even getting a little dirty with them to draw them out it's not calling them out of the pit it's going in the pit and pulling them out that's true sacrificial love not heaping demands but easing burdens not making more requirements but but coming alongside and helping you bear your burden that's genuine love I say God in this world that is so fallen and twisted give us genuine Godly love shed it abroad in our hearts by your Holy Ghost and let every other kind of love die and let this one live in me amen do you have a song brother looks like they're working on one right now sing this song and then we'll ask our brother jivaratnam to come and close us in a word of Prayer [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh think about his grace that is brought us through foreign [Music] love oh Grace [Music] what a great message I truly believe the whole Bible teaches the love of God
