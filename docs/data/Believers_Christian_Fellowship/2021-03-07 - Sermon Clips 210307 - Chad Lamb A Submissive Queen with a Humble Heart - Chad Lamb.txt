========================================

we believe in the manifestation of the spoken word we believe in a short quick where we believe in all of that amen but i wonder if now is not the time of character proving and testing our character amen remember esther brought deliverance listen esther brought down haman the second most powerful person in the kingdom brought him to ruin amen and all those that agreed with him were brought to ruin and his ten sons were killed and hung on the gallows we'll get to that in a minute amen and all because of esther but not in her might and not in her power and not in her taking a a position that wasn't hers but esther brought the destruction of the nemesis of the jews brought the destruction of all those that would harm the jews and brought deliverance for the nation by what by staying submissive as a as a humble submissive queen see the bride in this day we don't have to get bold and brash and burly and boastful and we don't have to be like other churches and we don't have to be like a queen who wants our own feasts and refuses the king this bride can stay submissive and humble and reverent amen and sweet and kind and what is she going to do she's going to bring down haman's kingdom and all that agree with him and bring deliverance to all god's people amen and then by her submission bring a resurrection out of the dead amen and there's going to be a rapture by the plan of god how because he's going to have a bride who's not going to act like vashti but he's going to have one who acts like esther
