[7:55] may all things be said and done for your

[7:58] amen amen i sure do appreciate the
[8:02] atmosphere
[8:04] i am always nice when he's here before i
[8:07] even get out here
[8:10] and i know he is and just want to uh
[8:14] tell you all i love you really really do
[8:17] i had a really nice day today
[8:19] it's beautiful and i i you couldn't have
[8:22] any better days than the day i had i
[8:23] just
[8:24] taken me by inspiration from one thing
[8:27] to the next just in his presence just
[8:29] walking with him
[8:30] and i find that's the greatest joy of my
[8:32] life
[8:33] always has been always will be the
[8:35] greatest joy of my life just let me walk
[8:37] with him
[8:38] i don't need anything i think brother
[8:40] branham tells the story of a black man
[8:42] he became a preacher and he was crossing
[8:44] over and he fell asleep and
[8:46] he said hey we went over there and
[8:48] someone was talking to him about a crown
[8:50] he said i don't talk to me about no
[8:51] crown
[8:52] just let me look at him for a thousand
[8:54] years and that's always been the
[8:55] greatest desire of a real believer
[8:58] is just seeing jesus just being with him
[9:01] and knowing you're with him and knowing
[9:03] he's with you
[9:04] it's an amazing amazing
[9:07] so i had a great great day
[9:11] and i just enjoyed it and i just want to
[9:13] come pour
[9:14] out and pour out what's been poured in
[9:17] over the last
[9:18] little while so if you will we'll just
[9:20] go right to the word
[9:22] jeremiah 29
[9:27] jeremiah 29 verse 10.
[9:44] jeremiah 29 verse 10
[9:48] for thus saith the lord that after
[9:50] seventy years be accomplished at babylon
[9:53] i will visit you and perform my good
[9:56] word toward you
[9:57] in causing you to return to this place
[10:00] for i know the thoughts that i think
[10:03] towards you
[10:04] saith the lord thoughts of peace and not
[10:06] evil
[10:07] to give you an expected end
[10:10] i like that he's already set it in
[10:14] motion
[10:15] he's bringing me somewhere he's had a
[10:17] vision and i'm in his vision i'm in his
[10:19] place and i'm just walking out
[10:21] a predetermined role that he already set
[10:23] for me
[10:25] and ye shall seek me
[10:29] then ye shall call upon me and ye shall
[10:32] go
[10:32] and pray unto me and i will hearken unto
[10:35] you
[10:36] and ye shall seek me and find me
[10:40] when ye shall search for me with
[10:43] all your heart and i will be found of
[10:46] you
[10:47] saith the lord and i will turn away your
[10:50] captivity
[10:51] and i will gather you from all the
[10:53] nations and from
[10:54] all the places whether i have driven you
[10:58] saith the lord and i will bring you
[11:00] again
[11:01] into the place where i caused you to be
[11:04] carried away
[11:06] captive one other portion of scripture
[11:10] i'd like you to turn to the song of
[11:11] solomon
[11:12] chapter 3.
[11:17] song of solomon chapter three verse one
[11:36] song of solomon chapter 3 verse 1 by
[11:38] night
[11:39] on my bed i sought him whom my
[11:42] soul loveth i sought him but i found him
[11:46] not
[11:47] i will rise now and go about the city in
[11:50] the streets and in the broad ways i will
[11:52] seek him
[11:53] whom my soul loveth i sought him but i
[11:56] found him not
[11:58] the watchmen that go about the city
[12:00] found me
[12:02] found me to him to whom i say
[12:05] saw ye him whom my soul loveth
[12:09] it was but a little that i passed from
[12:11] them but i found him whom my soul loveth
[12:14] i held him and would not let him go
[12:17] until i had brought him into my mother's
[12:20] house
[12:21] and into the chamber of her that
[12:24] conceived
[12:25] me may god add his blessings to the word
[12:28] you may be seated
[12:31] this may seem like strange portions of
[12:34] scripture but i have a thought
[12:36] that's been stirring in me and and i and
[12:38] i want to express
[12:39] it not so much in um human intellectual
[12:42] abilities but just
[12:44] my heart and i i
[12:47] i want to bring out this searching for
[12:50] god
[12:50] and my title tonight is in pursuit of my
[12:52] beloved
[12:53] and i you see here in jeremiah when you
[12:57] seek me with all of your heart you shall
[13:00] find me
[13:01] and the scripture here in solomon it's
[13:04] it's very
[13:05] clearly song of solomon is a strange
[13:07] book for me
[13:08] but it's an expression of a love story
[13:10] and it's extremely
[13:12] intimate and it's an expression of
[13:15] her heart's desire to find him even when
[13:18] she can't find him
[13:20] and i find that interesting because this
[13:22] happens multiple times in the book of
[13:24] solomon
[13:25] that her beloved hides himself you know
[13:28] he approaches he comes near and he hides
[13:31] he disappears and you start to wonder
[13:34] why
[13:36] you ever have those concepts you ever
[13:37] have those times in your life where it
[13:39] feels like god's withdrawn from me
[13:41] god has seemingly job said it looks like
[13:43] he's moved to my left hand
[13:45] i can't find him do you remember brother
[13:46] bannon talked about job he said he was a
[13:48] prophet
[13:49] and having that gift of prophet he could
[13:50] go up into those spiritual realms and he
[13:52] could get answers from god
[13:54] i believe it's a lot like brother
[13:55] branham when he said you know if i ever
[13:56] really wanted to know something
[13:58] i could get an answer he had a gift he
[14:00] had a prophetic gift if he wanted to see
[14:02] something in somebody he could get it if
[14:04] he wanted to know something about god
[14:06] he could go back and look at the story
[14:08] he could see the baptism of jesus and
[14:10] john
[14:10] he had the ability with a prophetic gift
[14:12] to go out and reach out and find the
[14:14] answers from god and in job he starts to
[14:17] talk about this
[14:18] this ability but job found him to be in
[14:21] hiding
[14:22] he found him to not be able to grab him
[14:24] and get a hold of him he had went to the
[14:26] left hand and it's interesting he says
[14:27] the left hand
[14:29] because the right hand is to whom the
[14:30] arm of the lord is revealed god is
[14:32] revealing himself
[14:33] with his right hand but in the left hand
[14:36] god job found god to be in hiding
[14:40] and the question then becomes why does
[14:42] god do that
[14:44] why does it look like sometimes he's so
[14:46] present
[14:47] and then sometimes he's so far
[14:51] i think it has a lot to do with the
[14:54] pursuit that he wants in you
[14:57] i um when i was in florida this question
[15:00] came my wife asked me a question she
[15:01] says kyle what do you deem as a treasure
[15:03] what's a treasure to you and i didn't
[15:06] answer her right away and she got upset
[15:07] at me but i was contemplating i was
[15:09] thinking about the answer
[15:10] i didn't want to just give a quick
[15:12] answer i wanted to think about it
[15:14] because to identify a treasure
[15:17] price is always determined by or yeah
[15:20] value
[15:21] is always determined by price paid if i
[15:23] say that is not worth a hundred thousand
[15:25] dollars but to you you're willing to pay
[15:27] a hundred thousand dollars for it
[15:28] guess what its value is the price you
[15:31] were willing to pay for it
[15:33] and this price that one is willing to
[15:35] pay determines its value to you as the
[15:38] individual
[15:39] not to everybody else and this question
[15:43] started coming in my mind
[15:44] and i started thinking it just going
[15:46] through my mind
[15:47] as a treasure i says you know if it's a
[15:49] treasure
[15:51] i'm willing to sacrifice a lot for it
[15:54] and when we think of a great treasure
[15:56] you would say now i know
[15:58] that jesus christ must value me because
[16:01] he paid a great price for me
[16:03] and that is never in question because
[16:05] you know the great price he paid for you
[16:08] but then the question becomes of what
[16:10] great price
[16:11] and a value is he to you
[16:14] you know because only what you're
[16:17] willing to pay
[16:18] to get him will determine his value to
[16:21] you
[16:22] your brother branham said if i had 100
[16:24] million dollars here or i had the
[16:25] opportunity to push a button and i could
[16:27] have 10 more minutes i think with my dad
[16:28] he said it wouldn't even be a question
[16:30] i'd pay the price
[16:32] and the truth of the matter is so many
[16:33] people just don't want to pay a price
[16:35] for him
[16:36] they don't they want somebody else to
[16:39] pay the price for them
[16:41] they want somebody else to do all their
[16:43] spiritual work
[16:44] for them they're looking to someone so
[16:47] they can stay spiritually lazy and not
[16:50] have to make an
[16:51] effort but i'm asking a question
[16:54] what type of bride is that what type of
[16:58] if i came home
[16:59] and my wife she served me she did things
[17:02] she took care of things
[17:04] but she never expressed the love for me
[17:06] you know the highlight of my day
[17:08] my absolute highlight of my day in this
[17:10] natural life when i come home
[17:12] is when i open the door and i hear daddy
[17:16] it's my highlight it's my highlight of
[17:19] my day no matter how bad the day was
[17:21] when i come home and i hear there's an
[17:23] expectation of my arrival
[17:25] man that gets me i see my little girl
[17:29] and my big girl i'm not gonna say my
[17:31] bigger girl
[17:34] older girl
[17:37] my wife when they're excited to see me
[17:40] it does something to me
[17:42] it does something to me and
[17:45] it's always the highlight it's always
[17:47] the place where i'm like oh man
[17:49] they do love me they're excited when i
[17:51] come around
[17:52] they're in anticipation of my arrival
[17:58] and we see in the song of solomon's that
[18:00] this beloved bride
[18:03] is an expectation she's anxiously
[18:06] awaiting him
[18:07] she's in constant pursuit of him
[18:10] she's not going to let anything stop her
[18:14] in getting to her beloved she's not
[18:17] going to let life circumstances
[18:19] she's not going to let disappointments
[18:21] she's not going to let difficulties
[18:23] she's not going to let anything stop her
[18:26] in her pursuit for him
[18:30] and i began to realize that
[18:34] over the last couple months now here's
[18:37] where i get personal
[18:38] because i want to be something that is
[18:40] difficult
[18:41] that's honest i don't want to be
[18:44] anything other than
[18:45] honest what is the point
[18:48] i don't want to be no pharisee no
[18:50] sadducee i want to be honest
[18:53] and i noticed something in my own life i
[18:56] noticed
[18:56] that my pursuit and my passion
[19:00] in my pursuit of the person jesus christ
[19:03] had cooled off it had cooled off
[19:07] and you know what snuck in that took
[19:08] over
[19:10] service
[19:13] now this will sound like a paradox but
[19:16] it's actually scriptural
[19:19] your service to him can sometimes get in
[19:22] the way
[19:24] of your love expressed to him i'll put
[19:27] it this way
[19:28] martha martha when jesus said martha
[19:31] martha
[19:33] mary chose the better thing he didn't
[19:36] say what she was doing was bad
[19:38] it wasn't wrong but there was a better
[19:40] thing martha
[19:42] there was a better thing at that moment
[19:44] the better thing at that moment was you
[19:45] to sit down
[19:47] sit down at my feet hear the word and
[19:50] believe the word
[19:52] you're so busy martha
[19:55] and he appreciated it no doubt he did
[19:57] but he was she was so busy
[19:59] entertaining him but she wasn't
[20:02] concerned enough
[20:03] to find out what was his desire
[20:08] she thought maybe he just wanted
[20:09] entertained wanted taken care of here's
[20:12] some more drinks here's some more
[20:13] this and here's that but she wasn't
[20:16] mindful of his desire
[20:17] his desire was sit down
[20:20] hear the word be quiet stop moving
[20:24] around so much
[20:25] stop going here and going there and i
[20:29] i i had this thought mainly because you
[20:32] know in
[20:32] covid 2020 there's not much missions
[20:36] work going on around the world
[20:38] like really honestly almost nothing
[20:42] seemed like the world stopped i think it
[20:44] needed to
[20:46] i think the i think life and the pace of
[20:49] life
[20:49] and our activities and all the things we
[20:51] were doing needed to
[20:53] stop so you could actually find out
[20:56] what is his desire
[20:59] there's no more searching lord what do
[21:02] you want
[21:03] there's no more asking there's go to
[21:06] church
[21:06] hear a wonderful sermon put some more
[21:08] pieces of the puzzle together
[21:10] but where's your pursuit of him
[21:14] now i'm not taking away from the
[21:15] ministry remember i'm just talking from
[21:16] my heart
[21:18] because god is clearly here and he's
[21:19] clearly putting the pieces of the puzzle
[21:21] together
[21:22] and in the same time he's revealing me
[21:24] to me
[21:25] and in the same time he's revealing his
[21:27] heart's desire to me
[21:28] amen because i don't want to i needed
[21:32] i wanted to return back to my first love
[21:36] i had to go back and brother branham
[21:39] says
[21:39] if you ever lose him along life's path
[21:42] you got to go right back
[21:44] where you left him nothing sinful
[21:47] just my passion my pursuit
[21:52] had cooled and i found
[21:56] i was hiding behind service
[21:59] i loved being a deacon i loved being
[22:02] youth
[22:03] loved traveling the word loved doing all
[22:05] that i could do
[22:06] but i was so busy i wasn't taking the
[22:09] time to have him whisper those love
[22:10] secrets to me directly
[22:12] and personally and you know we are
[22:15] all subject to it i'm not the only one
[22:19] i'm just the one being honest about it
[22:24] and what honestly honestly what is the
[22:27] point for an individual
[22:28] you know god didn't choose angels to
[22:30] preach the gospel
[22:31] he chose men men that make mistakes
[22:35] men that god can work with god can
[22:38] mold and he can shape and he can break
[22:42] he didn't choose angels
[22:45] he chose men that are weak
[22:49] frail subject to utter brokenness
[22:52] and i think that's what he wanted i'm
[22:55] actually convinced he is more
[22:58] interested in you being his greatest
[23:01] desire
[23:02] and in the pursuit you know i'm so
[23:04] convinced he creates the circumstances
[23:06] to create a desperation
[23:08] to have you to run after him again
[23:11] he does it like that he's done that like
[23:14] that for me many times
[23:18] so many times and so
[23:22] i i have to tell you this testimony and
[23:24] brother chad shared it
[23:26] but ten years ago when i first came to
[23:30] church here
[23:32] we're home folk right we're just family
[23:36] i came to church and it was i made
[23:38] friends with brother jeremy in about two
[23:40] weeks i don't know maybe three weeks
[23:41] after i was coming
[23:43] i was sitting right there in the middle
[23:45] back where i'm at
[23:47] and i had a really rough week and it was
[23:50] a tuesday because i remember it was
[23:51] right the day before the wednesday night
[23:52] service
[23:53] and brother jeremy called me said how
[23:54] you doing i said brother i'm having a
[23:56] horrible week
[23:57] i'm having a bad week really bad
[24:00] and he he talked me through and he
[24:03] helped me a lot
[24:04] and then the minister came and he
[24:05] preached and when he preached
[24:09] i was so utterly convinced that jeremy
[24:11] had snuck back into the back and told
[24:13] him
[24:15] my situation because it was too perfect
[24:20] and i was like well maybe that's what
[24:22] they do
[24:23] i like hmm that's pretty that's pretty
[24:27] direct guys
[24:29] and i remember i asked you i said you
[24:30] talked to the pastor didn't you
[24:32] he said no i'm like no you did
[24:35] no i didn't i'm like
[24:40] i mean this wasn't a good sermon this
[24:42] was lip to ear
[24:44] god knowing what i was doing god knowing
[24:47] intimately involved in my situation and
[24:51] it actually brought fear in me
[24:53] i'm like this ain't like any this is a
[24:55] this is a church where god speaks back
[24:58] it's when you talk and then god speaks
[25:00] back he's a
[25:02] risen god he's a living savior he's not
[25:04] an
[25:05] i was he's the i am the presence of the
[25:08] i am
[25:09] is here it scared me it really scared me
[25:13] i just it oh whoa
[25:16] praise the lord and god's done that over
[25:20] the years
[25:21] many times but he has never done it like
[25:24] he did it about a month ago
[25:28] and uh and you know how when
[25:31] jesus came to jesus or peter and them he
[25:34] came to them
[25:35] in their time of discouragement
[25:39] they were real down peter was down the
[25:42] disciples were down
[25:43] mary was down those on the road to
[25:45] emmaus they're all down they were
[25:47] depressed they were discouraged
[25:49] they had seen him they had walked with
[25:50] him they had known he was they were in
[25:52] his presence
[25:53] but then the whole chain chain scene
[25:56] changed
[25:57] now he wasn't there they didn't know
[25:59] what to do
[26:00] so you know what they did they went back
[26:03] to the last place they saw him
[26:06] peter went back to fishing same place
[26:08] that god had called him
[26:10] mary went back to the tomb last time she
[26:13] saw the body put behind
[26:15] that stone and this time he came back
[26:19] and did something the exact same way he
[26:21] had done it before
[26:23] cast your net on the other side of the
[26:24] boat peter
[26:27] what road to emmaus called him in
[26:30] and he did something just the way he had
[26:33] done it before
[26:35] and then their eyes were open and they
[26:37] saw
[26:38] him again and
[26:41] i was sitting there i was in florida
[26:45] and i went back to talking to him really
[26:48] talking to him
[26:49] you know there's a difference between
[26:50] just lay me down to sleep lord i pray my
[26:53] soul to take you know that's this yeah
[26:55] and then really lord i need to talk to
[26:57] you i need to talk to you
[26:59] i got a burden and a real burden is
[27:02] really bothering me
[27:03] it's bothering me and me it's bothering
[27:05] me everywhere i don't know what to do
[27:07] with it
[27:08] i came home brother jeremy and i have a
[27:12] conversation
[27:13] and i spilled my heart i mean i just
[27:17] gushed and just told him
[27:20] my concern and my concern was formalism
[27:24] my concern was religious tradition
[27:28] in me my concern was seeing
[27:32] myself being comfortable with my
[27:35] human ability and it was scaring me
[27:40] and then it was scaring me for people
[27:43] because i either i love the lord
[27:45] i really do i really love the lord and
[27:48] he knows that
[27:50] and i'm talking to him and uh and in the
[27:53] conversation we talk about
[27:55] the fig belief of religion and so many
[27:58] people are hiding behind it
[28:02] and then i get up that was saturday i
[28:04] had a youth meeting on sunday and i
[28:06] began
[28:06] with the kids and i i had talked i
[28:10] titled it seeing jesus again recognizing
[28:13] the presence of the i am
[28:15] and the whole thing was me and the kids
[28:17] could tell you
[28:18] the whole thing was me just absolutely
[28:20] almost in tears crying out
[28:22] saying if you value him what price will
[28:26] you pay for your relationship with him
[28:29] because your relationship to him is not
[28:31] determined
[28:32] by your proximity to the right church or
[28:36] your proximity to the right pastor or
[28:39] even knowing that you're in the right
[28:41] home
[28:42] that is not determining your
[28:45] relationship with god
[28:47] you actually have to be in pursuit and
[28:49] you actually have to value
[28:52] his relationship you notice that you can
[28:55] hide behind doctrine
[28:57] you can hide behind creeds and the
[28:59] correct religious
[29:00] statements you really can you can put
[29:04] that fig leaf on
[29:05] and i was talking to kids about this you
[29:07] can hide behind all those things
[29:09] and you know what it means to god
[29:11] nothing
[29:13] it means nothing in fact he says
[29:16] i will turn my eyes from your solemn
[29:19] feast and from your lifting up of hands
[29:22] it's isaiah 1. once you turn to it
[29:24] isaiah 1.
[29:30] isaiah 1 11 says to what purpose is the
[29:33] multitude of your sacrifices unto me
[29:36] saith the lord i am full of burnt
[29:38] offerings of rams and of the fat of
[29:41] fat of fed beasts and i delight not in
[29:43] the blood of bullocks or of lambs
[29:45] or of the he goats when he come to
[29:47] appear before me
[29:49] he hath required this at your hand to
[29:51] tread my courts
[29:53] bring me no more vain oblations and
[29:55] incenses and it
[29:56] is an abomination unto me the new moons
[29:58] and the sabbaths and the calling of
[30:00] assemblings i cannot away with it
[30:02] it is iniquity even the solemn
[30:04] assemblies
[30:05] your new moons and your appointed feasts
[30:07] my soul hateth
[30:09] they are a trouble unto me i am weary to
[30:12] bear them
[30:14] and when ye spread forth your hands i
[30:16] will hide my eyes from you
[30:18] yea when you make any prayers or many
[30:20] prayers
[30:21] i will not hear your hands are full of
[30:23] blood wash you make you clean and put
[30:25] away the evil
[30:26] doings from mine eyes and cease to do
[30:28] evil
[30:30] here's a people that's serving god and
[30:32] it's absolutely utterly in vain
[30:36] utterly in vain doing all the right
[30:38] things
[30:39] in vain it means nothing to him
[30:43] do you remember the story brother
[30:44] branham talks about that married couple
[30:47] i think it's paul rayder
[30:48] and paul rader said he had a situation
[30:51] wife they had a couple words and he
[30:53] walked out the door and he kissed her
[30:54] and left
[30:55] it came back he was walking down the
[30:57] street and he says you know what
[30:58] he says what if that's the last time i'm
[31:00] ever with my wife last time i get to
[31:02] kiss her
[31:03] he said oh it got to him he turned it
[31:04] back he walked back he found his wife
[31:06] sitting behind the door crying
[31:09] and he grabbed her picked her up kissed
[31:11] her again
[31:12] he walked away looked back and his wife
[31:14] was sitting there smiling
[31:16] he said what was the difference it was
[31:18] all the same act
[31:20] he said just one of them had meaning
[31:21] behind it
[31:23] one of them had meaning and that's what
[31:26] i'm thinking that this is getting to
[31:27] here with song of solomon and
[31:29] this beloved you're doing all the right
[31:31] things
[31:32] but why why do you do them
[31:36] why do you serve god why do you come
[31:37] here for what purpose and for what
[31:40] reason
[31:41] is it to express your love for him so i
[31:45] asked the kids i said
[31:46] i hope you're not just coming to youth
[31:48] meetings because your mom and dad's
[31:49] going to get mad at you
[31:51] i hope you don't just come to church
[31:52] because well what if they say something
[31:54] where are they at you know my goodness
[31:57] what would be the point in lifting up
[31:58] hands like that
[32:00] god knows your purpose in being here god
[32:03] knows you're not here because you love
[32:04] him
[32:05] you're probably just too afraid of
[32:06] standing the reproach of not being here
[32:09] maybe the family rejection things of
[32:11] that nature well that's a
[32:13] sad situation that's a bad motivator
[32:16] that's a horrible situation to find
[32:19] yourself in
[32:20] it means you've left your first love
[32:22] you've lost your reason you've lost your
[32:24] vision you lost your passion for
[32:26] christ that's the one thing i don't ever
[32:29] want
[32:30] and if i get that feeling i get
[32:33] desperate
[32:34] that's where i have to get and that's
[32:36] where we all have to get is we have to
[32:37] get
[32:38] desperate again we don't want to come to
[32:40] church and feel a false comfort
[32:43] because it's a false comfort just to be
[32:46] a part of the right church that's a
[32:47] wonderful thing
[32:48] but remember the whole desire and
[32:50] purpose of the ministry was to point you
[32:51] to christ
[32:52] not to draw themselves to draw you unto
[32:55] themselves
[32:56] and that i find this to be the most
[32:58] dangerous position is those that have
[32:59] proximity by gifts to the presence of
[33:01] god find themselves to be in the most
[33:03] dangerous of all positions
[33:05] because they can take the same thing
[33:06] with the gift and bring glory into
[33:07] themselves as opposed to the thing
[33:09] they're supposed to be doing
[33:10] and it's becoming the lowest among all
[33:11] as a servant to all and point them to
[33:13] christ
[33:14] and that became my biggest burden my
[33:16] biggest concern is i'm looking at the
[33:18] whole realm of things and i'm saying
[33:20] is this really what god wanted does he
[33:23] really want big conventions
[33:25] does he really want all the solemn
[33:27] feasts does he really want all the
[33:29] beauty
[33:30] because every time i look at him through
[33:31] the bible he's bruised
[33:33] he's wounded he's he's no beauty we
[33:36] should behold him he said it's not the
[33:38] beauty
[33:39] of physical characteristics it's a
[33:41] beauty of an
[33:42] inward character and he says you look
[33:45] with your eyes which you see with your
[33:46] heart
[33:47] and you notice here when song of
[33:49] solomon's beloved
[33:50] when she looks at him she says oh my
[33:52] beloved he's ruddy
[33:55] do you know what ruddy means not big and
[33:58] handsome
[33:59] but if you look at has she continues to
[34:01] describe him oh he's the fairest of ten
[34:04] thousand to my soul
[34:06] so i wonder what she saw when she looked
[34:08] at him
[34:10] i don't think it was the beauty of of a
[34:12] big form
[34:13] i think it was the attractiveness of
[34:15] character
[34:17] i think she was attracted to that
[34:18] character with everything in me i
[34:20] believe with all my heart
[34:22] that the bride is attracted to him in
[34:25] all of it she'll go through
[34:27] all of it to get to him and nothing will
[34:30] stop that pursuit
[34:32] even when they try and we'll get to that
[34:35] because in song of solomon there is
[34:36] literally
[34:37] that situation that happens
[34:40] in mark 8 it says and when he had called
[34:44] for the people
[34:45] unto him with his disciples also he said
[34:48] unto them
[34:48] whosoever will come after me let him
[34:51] deny himself
[34:52] take up his cross and follow me
[34:57] and this is interesting because
[35:00] you realize there always always a price
[35:03] to be paid to walk with him
[35:05] there's no there's no walking with him
[35:08] unless there's a cross for you to take
[35:09] up
[35:11] there's like a there has to be sacrifice
[35:12] right a treasure is something of value
[35:15] and
[35:16] what determines value is a price worth
[35:18] pain
[35:19] and if you pay no price for it what does
[35:21] it mean to you
[35:22] if you don't care about your closeness
[35:27] and proximity to the presence of god
[35:29] in your life everyday life not sunday
[35:31] and wednesday
[35:33] then you're not going to pay much of a
[35:35] price for it
[35:37] it's not precious to you if i give you a
[35:39] piece of gold
[35:41] are you just going to throw it in the
[35:42] front seat of your car and not lock your
[35:43] doors and park it outside
[35:46] no you would be afraid that anybody
[35:48] would tamper with this because it's a
[35:50] treasure to you
[35:52] but we also let we were so flippantly
[35:55] with our own personal life with our own
[35:58] consecration to god
[35:59] to our own proximity to hearing the
[36:01] whisper of his voice
[36:03] we treat that as if it's nothing we
[36:06] treat it as if
[36:07] who cares i want the pastor to do all
[36:10] the spiritual work for me
[36:13] i don't want to have to pay a price
[36:14] daily you mean i have to take up my
[36:16] cross
[36:17] daily you mean i need to do something i
[36:20] i seek you early in the morning like
[36:23] he's worth that
[36:26] he's worth it he's worth thinking about
[36:29] constantly
[36:30] he's worth being in his word not for the
[36:32] sake of being able to debate
[36:34] not for the sake of being able to show
[36:37] yourself to be something
[36:38] but you're in his word so you can know
[36:40] him you're in his word because you love
[36:43] him
[36:44] and you want to be in his presence see
[36:46] you can do all the right things
[36:49] for all the wrong reasons you can come
[36:51] to church
[36:52] it's the right thing to do and it could
[36:54] be the wrong thing
[36:56] you see i think god is looking for
[36:59] motive and objective
[37:00] in the bride of his desire he desires a
[37:03] certain kind of a bride he really does
[37:06] but he won't force you
[37:08] you make your own choice you have to
[37:10] make your own choice
[37:14] in hebrews it says by faith enoch was
[37:16] translated that she not
[37:17] he should not see death and was not
[37:19] found because god had translated him
[37:21] for before his translation he had this
[37:23] testimony that he pleased god
[37:25] but without faith it is impossible to
[37:27] please him
[37:29] for he that cometh the god must believe
[37:30] that he is and that he is a rewarder
[37:33] of who
[37:36] them that diligently seek him
[37:40] i think god wants you to pursue him
[37:43] i think this is why god went to the left
[37:46] hand in job's life
[37:48] i think this is like the beloved
[37:51] hid himself from his beloved
[37:56] it's the pursuit it's an expression
[37:59] it's a price being paid
[38:04] and we know that this whole story
[38:08] is a love story this whole story comes
[38:11] down to a husband and wife
[38:12] a man and a woman and
[38:15] for me if i came home and my
[38:19] wife never showed me affection she never
[38:23] like she took care of the house she
[38:24] swept the house she made dinner
[38:27] but she never expressed her love to me
[38:30] i would have a problem with that i would
[38:33] know that something isn't right in my
[38:35] home
[38:36] something has been left off something
[38:39] all the right things are being done but
[38:40] it's lost all of its meaning
[38:42] there's no more meaning behind these
[38:44] things remember brother branham said he
[38:46] talked about sister media she's so busy
[38:47] he said just come here
[38:48] sit down sit on my lap i want to talk to
[38:50] you for a little bit right
[38:52] that's just that's just an expression of
[38:54] love
[38:56] what man doesn't want his wife to sit
[38:57] and talk to him
[38:59] just have a cup of coffee talk about the
[39:01] day
[39:02] share secrets one with the other how
[39:04] things are going how things are not
[39:06] going
[39:06] it's a relationship right that's what
[39:09] god wants
[39:10] he didn't save you just so that you
[39:12] could you know do the right things
[39:14] say all the right things walk around say
[39:16] yep that's that's what i was looking for
[39:17] he wants a relationship he wants a
[39:20] loving relationship
[39:21] and that's what i believe he was looking
[39:23] for the whole time i want you to go to
[39:25] song of solomon's because
[39:27] i find in here there's a distraction
[39:32] and there's something that arises
[39:36] that becomes a very big situation
[39:43] in the first portion here of song of
[39:45] solomon's chapters 3
[39:48] it says by night on my bed i sought him
[39:51] whom my soul loveth i sought him but i
[39:54] found him not
[39:55] i will rise now and go about the city in
[39:57] the streets
[39:58] and in the broad ways i would seek him
[40:00] whom my soul loveth
[40:02] i sought him but i found him not
[40:05] the watchmen that go about the city
[40:08] found me
[40:09] to whom i said saw ye him whom i so
[40:11] loveth
[40:12] it was but a little that i passed from
[40:15] them but i found him whom my soul loveth
[40:18] i held him and i would not let him go
[40:20] until i had brought him into my mother's
[40:23] house
[40:23] and into the chamber of her that
[40:25] conceived me
[40:27] now this is the first pursuit of the
[40:29] beloved
[40:30] now in the second pursuit of the beloved
[40:33] we have a different reaction from the
[40:34] watchmen
[40:36] chapter 5 song of solomon
[40:44] chapter 5 verse 2
[40:47] i sleep but my heart waketh
[40:50] it is the voice of my beloved that
[40:53] knocketh
[40:54] saying open to me my sister my love
[40:57] my dove my undefiled for my head is
[41:00] filled with dew
[41:01] and my locks with drops of the night i
[41:03] have put off my coat
[41:05] how shall i put it on i have washed my
[41:07] feet how shall i defile it
[41:09] my beloved put in his hand by the whole
[41:12] of the door and my
[41:13] bowels were moved for him
[41:17] i think this is passionate
[41:20] i think this is really passionate this
[41:22] isn't cold and formal
[41:24] this is a love this is a real love and
[41:27] his very presence moving
[41:29] i rose up to open and my beloved and my
[41:31] hands dropped with mer in my fingers
[41:33] with sweet smelling myrrh
[41:35] upon the handles of the lock i opened to
[41:38] my beloved but my beloved hath withdrawn
[41:40] himself
[41:41] and was gone my soul failed
[41:45] when he spoke when he spake and i sought
[41:48] him
[41:48] but i could not find him i called him
[41:51] but he gave no
[41:52] answer the watchmen that
[41:55] went about the city found me they smote
[41:59] me they wounded me the keepers
[42:02] of the walls took away my veil
[42:06] from me what a different reaction from
[42:09] the watchmen
[42:12] the watchmen are preachers watchmen what
[42:14] of the night they stand
[42:16] guard they're there to be a protectant
[42:18] they're there to watch over
[42:20] and in this first pursuit there's no
[42:21] problem we'll help you
[42:23] in the second pursuit of the beloved to
[42:26] get to her beloved
[42:29] huh the watchmen are actually stopping
[42:32] this from happening
[42:33] the watchmen find themselves in a
[42:35] position as a
[42:36] barrier to getting to her beloved
[42:39] and they do something that is shocking
[42:42] they removed the veil
[42:44] now i don't know a lot about why we do
[42:46] the traditions we do but i believe it's
[42:48] the bride
[42:49] the husband of the gr the groom who
[42:52] takes the veil off
[42:53] of the bride what right does this
[42:56] watchman have to go to this position
[43:00] what role is he trying to play why is
[43:03] the watchman
[43:04] trying to do something that only he can
[43:07] do
[43:09] this is an interesting thing for me and
[43:12] then
[43:12] you sum this all together with this
[43:14] great big desire and heart concern that
[43:16] i have
[43:18] is religion over your relationship
[43:22] formalism cold formalism
[43:26] and even gifted men getting in the way
[43:30] of actually you connecting with christ
[43:32] again
[43:34] they're there to help you but every
[43:35] brother branham said i never did preach
[43:37] in such a way to draw people to myself
[43:39] he said i only pointed them to christ
[43:41] pointed them to christ
[43:42] pointed into christ and that was the
[43:44] goal and the objective all along the way
[43:46] was to connect you back to your beloved
[43:49] but we find
[43:51] in this last time it becomes an issue
[43:55] paul warned us of this if you turn in
[43:57] your bibles
[43:59] philippians chapters 3
[44:03] now paul i find this to be so
[44:05] interesting paul with the great
[44:06] revelation that he has
[44:08] paul being the first church age
[44:11] messenger and having the mystery of
[44:12] christ
[44:14] we see that paul never loses his desire
[44:18] and a pursuit of
[44:19] and he even warns the people of what
[44:22] could cause
[44:23] their lack of pursuit
[44:26] philippians 3 1
[44:30] finally my brethren rejoice in the lord
[44:32] to write
[44:33] the same things to you to me indeed
[44:36] is not grievous but for you it is safe
[44:40] beware of dogs beware of evil workers
[44:43] beware of the concession beware of the
[44:47] men
[44:48] beware of those that are the great men
[44:50] among you
[44:52] for we are the circumcision which
[44:55] worship god in spirit
[44:57] and rejoice in jesus in christ jesus and
[44:59] have no confidence in the flesh
[45:01] though i might also have confidence in
[45:03] flesh if any other man thinketh it
[45:06] he hath whereof he might trust in the
[45:09] flesh
[45:09] i more circumcise the eighth day the
[45:12] stock of israel and the tribe of
[45:13] benjamin
[45:14] and hebrew to the hebrews as touching
[45:16] the law of pharisee
[45:18] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[45:21] touching the righteousness which is of
[45:22] the law
[45:23] blameless but what things were gained to
[45:26] me
[45:26] those i counted lost for christ yea
[45:29] doubtless and i count
[45:30] all things but lost for the excellency
[45:33] of the knowledge of christ
[45:35] jesus my lord for whom i have suffered
[45:38] the loss
[45:39] of all things and i count them but done
[45:42] that i might win christ and be found in
[45:45] him not having my known righteousness
[45:46] which is of the law
[45:48] but that which is through the faith of
[45:49] christ the righteousness which is of god
[45:51] by faith that i may know him
[45:55] and the power of his resurrection and
[45:57] the fellowship
[45:58] of his sufferings being made conformable
[46:01] unto his death if by any means
[46:05] i might attain unto the resurrection of
[46:08] the dead
[46:09] now here's this not as though i already
[46:12] attained either were already perfect
[46:16] but i follow after that if i may
[46:18] apprehend
[46:20] that for which i am apprehended of
[46:23] christ jesus
[46:24] brethren i count not myself to have
[46:26] apprehended
[46:27] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[46:30] things which are behind
[46:31] i'm reaching forth into those things
[46:34] which
[46:34] are before i press
[46:37] toward the mark of the high calling of
[46:40] the prize of the pri
[46:41] of the high calling of god in christ
[46:43] jesus
[46:44] paul never stopped in his pursuit never
[46:48] did he get to a point where he says i
[46:49] have arrived
[46:51] i can let down the bar and i can relax
[46:54] because there's nothing more for me to
[46:56] do i see the plan of god and i know i'm
[46:57] a part in i have a part in the plan
[47:00] that revelation that that never the
[47:02] revelation of the mystery of christ
[47:04] never produced that in paul
[47:06] it never produced something inside of
[47:08] him where he wasn't constantly reaching
[47:10] out for something constantly reaching
[47:12] out to christ
[47:13] constantly pressing it's difficult
[47:17] it's a price to be paid it's constant
[47:20] now we know he paid the great price and
[47:22] you know what he did he put something on
[47:24] the inside of you that loves him so much
[47:26] you're willing to pay whatever price to
[47:27] get him
[47:28] it's really not him that will if they're
[47:29] him that runeth let me just assure you
[47:31] it's nothing to do with you it's
[47:33] something he put on the inside of you
[47:35] but don't let the devil come and try to
[47:36] cool you off with some type of religious
[47:38] work
[47:39] or some type of service or some type of
[47:40] system or some type of ministry
[47:42] that stops you from in your pursuit to
[47:44] him god puts something down on the side
[47:47] of you
[47:47] to set you free and it's only going to
[47:50] ever be set free as you connect with him
[47:52] the living word the present tense i am
[47:54] you know martha one day she got in a bad
[47:56] situation
[47:57] martha martha member service she was
[47:59] serving god she was entertaining god
[48:01] but she never was taking god at his word
[48:03] her his word
[48:04] she hadn't expressed fully her faith in
[48:07] god but brother branham said she
[48:08] redeemed herself one time
[48:10] death struck her home and in the very
[48:13] time she's calling out he goes farther
[48:15] away
[48:16] what he's hiding himself again
[48:19] why is he doing this all the time why
[48:21] does he go silent why does he go in
[48:23] darkness why does he go in hiding
[48:25] it's because he wants you to pursue him
[48:28] he wants an
[48:28] effort he wants to he shows you his
[48:30] great love
[48:31] what love will you show him what great
[48:35] price will you pay for him
[48:36] what does it mean to you it means
[48:39] whatever price you're willing to pay
[48:42] so here comes jesus now he comes
[48:45] and now martha's gonna put her faith
[48:48] into action
[48:49] he says oh your brother will rise oh i
[48:51] know in the future
[48:53] we know that you're a god of the future
[48:55] and you're a god of the
[48:56] the was no i am the resurrection
[49:02] i am the resurrection and she came in
[49:04] contact
[49:05] with the resurrection that i am
[49:09] and her recognition and faith that the
[49:11] presence of the i
[49:12] am is here brother brown said put the
[49:15] wheels of the resurrection into action
[49:18] and it called forth the dead and you
[49:20] know what does it in your life too
[49:22] because what a resurrection that was but
[49:24] what a resurrection that this
[49:26] is to be quick and to be made alive how
[49:29] by recognizing the presence of the i
[49:31] am is currently in my midst the presence
[49:34] of the i am knows where i am
[49:35] the presence of the i am knows where i
[49:37] was the presence of the i am knows what
[49:39] difficulty i find myself in
[49:41] and the presence of the i am is also
[49:43] recognizing or maybe even hiding seeing
[49:45] if i'm willing to
[49:46] knock and keep on knocking to seek and
[49:49] keep on seeking
[49:50] and not stopping in my pursuit of him
[49:53] not letting anything cool me off not
[49:55] letting anything
[49:56] stop me faith has muscles i think he
[49:59] said it's got some
[50:00] toughness to it it doesn't sit there and
[50:02] needs to be babied
[50:04] faith has something on the inside says
[50:06] get out of my way
[50:07] that is my beloved and i'm going after
[50:09] him
[50:10] is it just me or does it maybe i'm the
[50:12] only one that feels like
[50:14] i am not satisfied with cold formalism
[50:16] guys i'm not satisfied with church
[50:18] traditions
[50:19] i'm not satisfied with just say oh
[50:21] praise god we did our religious duty
[50:22] let's go home
[50:23] nonsense i was never looking for that i
[50:25] had that 10 15 years ago
[50:27] i was looking for the presence of the i
[50:28] am in the midst that i could talk to and
[50:30] he talks back
[50:31] i was looking for the presence of the
[50:32] ayah i'm in difficulty father deliver me
[50:34] and he comes and delivers me
[50:35] and all he was ever looking for was just
[50:37] somebody to believe
[50:39] to believe him someone that says i
[50:41] believe you lord
[50:43] when did the third full manifest when
[50:44] the little woman that probably didn't
[50:45] know her full abcs and couldn't say the
[50:47] right thing says
[50:48] that ain't nothing but the truth lord i
[50:51] believe it
[50:52] i believe it and when is the promise of
[50:54] god when does god come into reality
[50:56] when he actually has people on the scene
[50:58] that say that ain't nothing but the
[50:59] truth
[51:01] god you're the same yesterday today and
[51:03] forever
[51:04] god i have sickness but i know you're
[51:06] here the presence of the i
[51:08] am is here the resurrection is here
[51:10] there is nothing i have need of because
[51:12] he's here
[51:13] and if i have him i have everything
[51:16] there's nothing else that could ever
[51:17] satisfy because he's here
[51:20] but i think there's a pursuit i think
[51:23] there's some energy
[51:24] i think there's some passion behind that
[51:27] expression
[51:29] and and i love it
[51:33] i love the fact that god in his mercy
[51:35] can see us in whatever state we're in
[51:38] whatever state we find ourselves to be
[51:39] in he knows right where you are amen
[51:42] maybe even allowing it to happen maybe
[51:45] he's even allowing a darkness to come in
[51:49] just to see is he going to fight to come
[51:51] to me
[51:52] you ever notice that it's like there's a
[51:54] bad situation
[51:56] can't get out of it what do you do he
[51:59] could turn he could flip a switch
[52:01] there's a man here that can turn on the
[52:02] light he can flip the switch at any
[52:04] moment
[52:05] but there's something inside of you that
[52:07] he's looking for
[52:08] there's a looking away to see him i'm
[52:12] going to look away from everything until
[52:13] i find him and i'm not going to stop
[52:15] until i get a hold of him
[52:17] you know what i mean and so this is the
[52:19] things that i've been just
[52:20] chewing on and i've been so utterly
[52:22] shocked in my own self is
[52:24] here i am expressing these things to the
[52:26] youth and here comes god confirming
[52:28] himself and encouraging me at the same
[52:30] time
[52:31] encouraging me saying i'm still the god
[52:33] that speaks back
[52:35] i never changed i never left i'm still
[52:38] here
[52:39] the presence of the present tense
[52:40] resurrected i
[52:42] am still here and now i'm getting my own
[52:45] resurrection
[52:46] i'm being caught up out of the darkness
[52:48] that i was once in
[52:49] and saying he's here the presence of i
[52:52] am still here never changes
[52:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[52:59] that is awesome that's something you can
[53:03] say amen
[53:04] he's awesome never has changed
[53:09] in being an amazing god just was always
[53:11] looking to show his strength on behalf
[53:13] of his wife
[53:14] i've thought of this you imagine if i
[53:16] came home and my
[53:17] let's say i'm at home and my wife's
[53:19] sorry i'm just personal right so it's a
[53:21] marriage so i can find identification
[53:23] in these things if i came home and my
[53:26] wife was
[53:27] not thinking i was doing a very good job
[53:29] she's like i don't think you're doing a
[53:30] good job
[53:31] i don't think you're actually able to
[53:34] pay these bills i'm a little bit nervous
[53:36] i'm a little bit scared that you're not
[53:38] going to be able to come through next
[53:39] month
[53:40] so i'm going to get a job i'd be like
[53:44] no you're not no
[53:47] something inside of a man would say are
[53:50] you doubting my ability
[53:52] right what do you think god thinks when
[53:55] you never take your situation to him
[53:57] you always want to solve your own
[53:58] problems god did not create man to shift
[54:01] for himself
[54:03] brother branham said that he didn't make
[54:05] you to be that way so what is that
[54:07] maybe that's your human ability working
[54:08] through a fallen state of a fallen
[54:10] physical form that you're in that's
[54:12] trying to usurp your abilities over
[54:14] god's
[54:16] maybe you're trying to do things that
[54:17] god would like to show himself strong on
[54:19] your behalf
[54:20] but you won't let him you know you think
[54:23] of these things you get to thinking
[54:24] about what is the bride of his desire
[54:26] what kind of wife does he want
[54:28] choosing of a bride he's looking for a
[54:30] certain type of the character
[54:32] you know even worse if i came home and
[54:36] it's the middle of the night and there's
[54:38] somebody breaking in
[54:39] my wife says go hide in the closet i got
[54:41] this
[54:44] then i say woman i love you
[54:48] but you go to bed i die to defend
[54:52] my home right these are characteristics
[54:55] now why do i have that in me as a father
[54:56] and as a husband
[54:58] that's a characteristic of a husband he
[55:00] wants to show himself strong on your
[55:02] behalf
[55:03] just trust him just believing just
[55:05] believe that he's same yesterday
[55:07] today and forever he's here but put your
[55:10] faith into action and actually pursue
[55:12] him
[55:13] say lord that's your promise i believe
[55:15] you're going to fulfill your promise
[55:17] i'm sick lord that's your promise i know
[55:20] you want to show yourself strong on my
[55:21] behalf
[55:22] i believe it lord i'm going to put that
[55:24] the cogs of the resurrection
[55:26] the power of the resurrected jesus
[55:27] christ in my mind into action
[55:30] i'm sad i'm down i'm depressed but he's
[55:33] the prince of peace in the mighty god
[55:35] father that's your promise i'll never
[55:36] leave you nor forsake you i'll be with
[55:37] you and in you to the end of the world
[55:39] father i believe it and he'll get into
[55:41] action
[55:43] i believe he wants to get into action i
[55:45] know he wants to get into action because
[55:47] i
[55:47] i tasted it i tasted of that fruit and i
[55:50] know it's good
[55:52] i believe it with all my heart all i did
[55:55] down there in florida i got quiet and i
[55:57] said lord i gotta talk to you
[56:00] and he talked back
[56:03] means everything to me absolutely
[56:06] everything to me
[56:08] i wanted to play something for you but
[56:12] before we do that
[56:13] psalm 27.
[56:23] you know this by heart
[56:28] it's a rapture it's also a revelation
[56:43] the lord is the light of my life or my
[56:45] salvation whom shall i fear
[56:47] the lord is the strength of my life to
[56:49] whom shall i be afraid
[56:51] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[56:53] foes come up and eat my flesh they
[56:54] stumbled and fell
[56:55] though in host should encamp against me
[56:57] my heart
[56:59] shall not fear the war should rise
[57:01] against me and this will i be confident
[57:03] one thing one thing
[57:07] have i desired of the lord that i will
[57:09] seek after that i may dwell in the house
[57:11] of the lord all the days of my life
[57:13] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[57:15] inquire in his temple
[57:16] for in time of trouble he hide me in his
[57:18] pavilion
[57:19] in the secret of his tabernacle he'll
[57:21] hide me he shall set me
[57:23] upon a rock and now shall my head be
[57:26] lifted up above mine enemies round about
[57:28] me
[57:28] therefore i will offer in his tabernacle
[57:31] sacrifices of joy
[57:32] i will sing yea i will sing praises unto
[57:34] him when i
[57:36] when hear o lord when i cry unto with my
[57:40] voice
[57:41] have mercy upon me an answer when thou
[57:44] saidest seek ye my face my heart said
[57:47] within
[57:48] thee thy face i will seek
[57:52] never stopping in its pursuit the bride
[57:55] never stops to seek him
[57:58] and she finds him that's the promise
[58:02] in seeking you find in knocking he
[58:05] answers and asking you receive
[58:09] because that's my husband amen that's my
[58:12] beloved
[58:13] he called me unto himself and now he's
[58:16] ex
[58:17] he's found a wife he's found a bride
[58:20] that needs him that really needs him
[58:24] desperately needs him knows no human
[58:27] ability
[58:28] no human strength no great abilities
[58:31] of any sort and the little i had he's
[58:34] doing a very good job of busting that to
[58:36] pieces
[58:37] putting me back on that potter's wheel
[58:40] and that's a good place to be sometimes
[58:42] i want to play this for you it's on my
[58:44] mind
[58:45] something brother branham had said that
[58:47] paints this picture quite well
[58:50] brother franco if you have that cued up
[58:52] a little bit i know it's a little
[58:53] different but it fits
[58:56] and there's a boy who worked up there
[58:58] with him from indianapolis about
[59:00] all about 100 miles above jeffersonville
[59:03] where i
[59:03] i live or live and there was um
[59:08] he said that my brother one day he said
[59:10] doc
[59:11] he said i i'm gonna get married if i
[59:14] just had enough money to pay the
[59:16] preacher
[59:17] he said i got enough money to get my
[59:19] license but said i haven't got enough
[59:21] money
[59:21] to pay the preacher doc said well my
[59:23] brother's a preacher
[59:25] and and he he may marry you he said he
[59:28] never charges people for things like
[59:30] that
[59:31] he said when you asked him if he'll
[59:33] marry me
[59:34] well that night my brother asked me i
[59:36] said if he's never been married before
[59:38] either one of them and
[59:39] there everything's all right he said
[59:41] well he i asked him and i said if it is
[59:44] telling come on down so
[59:46] when saturday come along and the boy
[59:48] came down
[59:50] it's been a great thing for me to always
[59:52] look back upon this
[59:55] i had a rainy afternoon in an old
[1:00:00] chevrolet car with the headlights wired
[1:00:04] on with a
[1:00:04] baling wire a drill up out front
[1:00:08] just a while after i'd lost my wife and
[1:00:10] i was batching
[1:00:12] two little rooms and and doc was up
[1:00:15] there with me waiting for them and
[1:00:17] and a boy got out of the car and it
[1:00:19] certainly didn't look like a groom to me
[1:00:22] or would to anybody i guess yeah
[1:00:25] i could buy a pretty good pair of shoes
[1:00:27] for a dollar and a half
[1:00:29] and he had on a pair was run over
[1:00:32] and his trousers it was real baggy and
[1:00:36] it had on one of these old mole skin
[1:00:39] jackets i don't
[1:00:39] get some of you older people would
[1:00:41] remember it looked like i could run
[1:00:42] through a
[1:00:43] washing machine without being wrenched
[1:00:44] and it was streaking
[1:00:46] tied up like this the corner up
[1:00:50] and uh a little lady got out on the side
[1:00:53] with a little
[1:00:54] oh something little checky lip dress i
[1:00:56] don't know i made a
[1:00:57] mistake on calling that kind of goods
[1:00:59] one time game ham i believe it's called
[1:01:02] and um so uh it was uh i said it wrong
[1:01:05] again
[1:01:08] and i said uh she got out of the car and
[1:01:12] they come up the steps and and when they
[1:01:15] walked in the poor little thing
[1:01:17] she i guess just about all she had on

[1:03:20] little city blast
[1:03:21] and down on the river where i had some
[1:03:23] tin laying up where i went every day
[1:03:25] when i was as a lion so when the rest of
[1:03:27] fellows they all sit around told jokes
[1:03:29] and things
[1:03:30] i'd get in the truck and run down the
[1:03:31] river and pray during that minute
[1:03:33] and read my bible under a big piece of
[1:03:36] tin
[1:03:36] where an old iron works used to be
[1:03:39] there's a bunch of old box cars sitting
[1:03:40] down there and
[1:03:41] this fella had went down there and got
[1:03:43] one of them boxed cars and saw him a
[1:03:45] door in it
[1:03:46] and had taken a newspaper and tacky
[1:03:49] buttons
[1:03:51] how many knows what a tacky button is
[1:03:53] there's no kentuckians here

[1:03:57] thumbtack in a little
[1:03:58] spring and then push it in the that's a
[1:04:00] tacky button
[1:04:01] so they had put it all over and he went
[1:04:03] up there to arm works and got him
[1:04:06] uh some stuff and made a step to come up
[1:04:10] and got some old boxes and had him a
[1:04:11] table and i thought one day i'll go down
[1:04:14] and
[1:04:15] see how they're getting along about six
[1:04:18] months before that i married
[1:04:20] evie knight's daughter the e.t slider

[1:05:03] little couch and a folding bed but they
[1:05:06] both was married by the same ceremony

[1:05:29] every year and just
[1:05:30] only children and they had just
[1:05:33] everything they wanted

[1:05:36] acquainted with them one of their
[1:05:37] friends

[1:05:40] chummed together and that's how i got
[1:05:41] acquainted when they wanted me to marry
[1:05:43] him
[1:05:44] so um i went up to visit him and i got
[1:05:47] outside
[1:05:48] all forward outside walked up the steps
[1:05:51] and
[1:05:52] and i got up a little bit too close and
[1:05:55] i heard them
[1:05:56] and they were really fussing they were
[1:05:59] jealous
[1:06:00] of one another they had been to a dance
[1:06:02] she was a very
[1:06:03] pretty girl and she was
[1:06:07] kind of one of these beauty queens
[1:06:10] she took many prizes around there and
[1:06:12] won some cars and things for being
[1:06:14] beauty queen
[1:06:15] and i looked at him and one was sitting
[1:06:18] in one corner and one the other
[1:06:20] fussing about some boy she danced with
[1:06:23] her some girl or something
[1:06:24] when i come up they jumped up real quick
[1:06:27] and grabbed one other cross
[1:06:28] the floor in their their hands across
[1:06:30] the board come walk more towards your
[1:06:31] door say bye hello there brother brandon
[1:06:34] how are you getting along i said all

[1:06:47] see
[1:06:48] i see you're putting on something that
[1:06:50] isn't real
[1:06:52] now you can't get warm by a painted fire
[1:06:55] like some of these churches trying to
[1:06:57] paint pentecost or something happened a
[1:06:58] thousand years ago or two thousand years
[1:07:00] ago
[1:07:01] you can't get warmed by a painted fire
[1:07:04] a pentecost is just as real today as it
[1:07:06] was then
[1:07:07] the fire's still falling it ain't a
[1:07:09] painted part it's a real power
[1:07:12] so uh they've just there they were see i
[1:07:14] i wouldn't want to live like that
[1:07:17] well i thought you know just down over
[1:07:19] the cliff there and
[1:07:20] over on the river there's where this
[1:07:23] other couple
[1:07:24] wound up i thought one saturday
[1:07:27] afternoon i'd slip down
[1:07:28] there and see how this is getting along
[1:07:30] so i'm
[1:07:31] dirty on the face and the dirty overalls
[1:07:34] on my
[1:07:34] tools on i thought i'd slip up on them i
[1:07:37] slept along like i was watching for
[1:07:39] insulators being cracked by the
[1:07:40] lightning or something
[1:07:42] as i walked along side of the telephone
[1:07:44] wire the
[1:07:45] electric cables along the river and
[1:07:48] there's the old chevrolet was sitting
[1:07:50] out front
[1:07:51] it was about a year later after i'd
[1:07:53] married them and there was uh
[1:07:55] uh the door was open and i can hear him
[1:07:58] talking so this
[1:08:00] sounds like a hypocrite but i walked up
[1:08:02] close enough that i could listen see
[1:08:04] what they saying
[1:08:05] stay there and i just want to know for
[1:08:07] myself i like to find out
[1:08:09] be sure i know what i'm talking about
[1:08:11] that's what i do about god's word
[1:08:13] is it the truth or is it the truth will
[1:08:15] he keep his word or doesn't he keep his
[1:08:17] word
[1:08:17] if he doesn't keep his word then he's
[1:08:19] not god see he does keep his word he's
[1:08:21] god
[1:08:23] and so i wanted to see how they was
[1:08:25] getting long enough slipped along the
[1:08:26] side real easy
[1:08:28] i heard him say well honey i wanted
[1:08:31] to get that for you so bad she said i
[1:08:34] look sweetheart
[1:08:35] she said this dress is all right she
[1:08:38] said why
[1:08:39] ah this is just fine so now i appreciate
[1:08:41] that but you see
[1:08:42] i slipped around so i could look through
[1:08:44] the crack where the door
[1:08:46] been shoved open there in the box car
[1:08:48] and
[1:08:49] there he was sitting in there and her
[1:08:52] on his lap and
[1:08:56] his arm around her arm around him
[1:08:59] and he had a one of these old slouched
[1:09:02] hats and
[1:09:02] and put a little hole and mashed it down
[1:09:05] the top and poured out his
[1:09:07] paycheck and that he was laying it out
[1:09:09] on the table said so much for groceries
[1:09:11] so much for insurance and so much
[1:09:14] uh on the car and they couldn't make
[1:09:17] their ends meet
[1:09:18] come to find out he'd seen a little
[1:09:20] dress up there in a window been looking
[1:09:21] at it for a couple weeks
[1:09:23] that cost a dollar and something he
[1:09:25] wanted to get he said well honey it

[1:09:30] dress i don't really need it
[1:09:32] see and that little queen
[1:09:36] and i backed off and
[1:09:39] looked back i could see the steeple on
[1:09:41] top of the other house
[1:09:44] i stood there and looked a few minutes i
[1:09:48] thought who is the rich man
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:52] i thought if bill branham if you want to
[1:09:56] take which place
[1:09:56] where would you go for me
[1:10:00] i take not the that pretty thing up on
[1:10:02] top
[1:10:03] would i take this character down here as
[1:10:05] a real
[1:10:06] homemaker somebody that loved me and
[1:10:09] stayed with me
[1:10:11] somebody tried to make a home and not
[1:10:13] bleeding for everything for
[1:10:15] fine reasons somebody that was with you
[1:10:18] part of you that's always stuck with me
[1:10:22] of how that was one chose a beautiful
[1:10:25] girl the other
[1:10:26] chose character
[1:10:30] amen i want to be the one
[1:10:33] that he chooses that's character
[1:10:37] not looking for beauty there's really no
[1:10:40] beauty that he should behold us
[1:10:42] just character just the faith keep the
[1:10:45] dress
[1:10:46] keep the comfort keep the nice house i
[1:10:49] want you
[1:10:51] though i speak with tongues of men and
[1:10:53] angels and have not charity
[1:10:54] and become sinking brat sounding brass
[1:10:57] tinkling symbol
[1:10:58] though i have gifts of prophecy and
[1:11:00] understand all the mysteries and all
[1:11:02] knowledge and though i have all faith so
[1:11:03] that i could remove mountains
[1:11:05] have not charity i'm nothing though i
[1:11:07] bestow all my goods to feed the poor and
[1:11:09] give my body to be burned and have not
[1:11:11] charity it profiteth me nothing charity
[1:11:14] suffereth all in its kind
[1:11:15] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[1:11:18] of itself
[1:11:19] it is not puffed up it doth not behave
[1:11:21] itself unseemly
[1:11:22] and it seeketh not her own it is not
[1:11:25] easily provoked
[1:11:26] and it thinketh no evil rejoiceth and no
[1:11:29] evil and
[1:11:30] rejoiceth not in iniquity and rejoiceth
[1:11:33] in the truth
[1:11:34] beareth all things believeths all things
[1:11:37] and hopeths
[1:11:38] all things and endureth all things
[1:11:41] charity never faileth
[1:11:43] but when there's prophecies they'll fail
[1:11:45] if there's tongues
[1:11:46] they shall cease whether there be
[1:11:49] knowledge it shall all vanish away
[1:11:51] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:11:54] part but when that which is perfect is
[1:11:56] come
[1:11:57] then that which is in part is done away
[1:12:00] with
[1:12:01] and we have by god's grace
[1:12:04] knowing that that perfect has come
[1:12:07] he's here in the fullness of his word
[1:12:11] and that's what i wanted from the
[1:12:13] beginning that's what i wanted
[1:12:15] so don't talk to me about things that
[1:12:17] take me away from him
[1:12:18] don't talk to me about beautiful things
[1:12:21] i wanted him
[1:12:22] i've always wanted him i want to see
[1:12:24] that life
[1:12:25] not just see it at a distance i wanted
[1:12:26] to see it living in me
[1:12:28] expressing in me handling situations the
[1:12:30] right way and doing things the right way
[1:12:33] and when it isn't i go back to where i
[1:12:36] found him
[1:12:38] i go back where i once found him
[1:12:43] if he's in church age you know brother
[1:12:44] banham talks about this in that first
[1:12:46] church age how did the devil come in
[1:12:48] he came in by cooling them off and
[1:12:50] causing them to be formal
[1:12:52] the fervent desire to please god and a
[1:12:54] passion to know his word and the cry of
[1:12:55] the reaching out in the spirit all
[1:12:57] begins to fade and instead
[1:12:58] of that church being on fire with the
[1:13:00] fire of god it had cooled off and become
[1:13:02] a bit formal
[1:13:03] that is what was happening back there in
[1:13:05] ephesians they were getting formal
[1:13:06] the abandonment to god was dying out and
[1:13:09] the people weren't too careful about
[1:13:11] what god thought of them
[1:13:13] as they began to think about a careful
[1:13:15] about what the world was thinking of
[1:13:17] them
[1:13:17] that second generation coming on was
[1:13:20] just like
[1:13:20] israel they demanded a king to be like
[1:13:23] other nations
[1:13:24] when they did that they rejected god and
[1:13:27] they did it
[1:13:28] but they did it anyway that is the
[1:13:31] history of the church
[1:13:32] when it thinks more of conforming to the
[1:13:34] world instead of conforming to god
[1:13:37] it isn't long until you see them stop
[1:13:39] doing the things
[1:13:40] they used to start doing the things they
[1:13:42] wouldn't do initially
[1:13:44] they changed their manner of dress and
[1:13:46] their attitudes
[1:13:47] and their behaviors they get lacks
[1:13:50] because the word ephesus means
[1:13:52] relaxed and drifting israel chose a king
[1:13:56] a great man a false church wants to
[1:13:59] choose great men and put great men
[1:14:02] in their position to always do the
[1:14:05] spiritual work
[1:14:06] that they should be doing themselves
[1:14:08] always putting something between them
[1:14:10] and god
[1:14:11] that's what we don't want we want a
[1:14:14] spiritual man yeah we want
[1:14:16] godly men yup we want them constantly
[1:14:18] pointing us
[1:14:19] to christ all the time
[1:14:25] i delivered my heart i think i'm done
[1:14:28] musicians will you come
[1:14:31] i am
[1:14:34] if you left your first love go back
[1:14:37] where you left him
[1:14:39] remember the story asked an old soldier
[1:14:42] who was dying
[1:14:43] he said you better find the lord real
[1:14:44] quick
[1:14:46] he said i don't know where he's at he
[1:14:48] said will you go back where you left him
[1:14:50] and he says now i lay me down to sleep i
[1:14:53] pray the soul
[1:14:54] my lord my soul to keep and if i die
[1:14:56] before i wake i pray the lord my soul to
[1:14:58] take
[1:14:59] what brother bam said he said he found
[1:15:01] him right where he left him
[1:15:03] he found him right where he left him i
[1:15:06] believe it's real simple
[1:15:08] i honestly believe it's simpler than
[1:15:10] what sometimes we think it is
[1:15:12] i really do if he wants me to know
[1:15:14] something he'll reveal it to me
[1:15:16] it's not my ability i've got none
[1:15:20] and the sooner i came to that
[1:15:21] realization the better off i am and the
[1:15:23] better off we'll all be
[1:15:24] is realizing we can't do nothing right
[1:15:26] we never could do anything right
[1:15:28] all i know to do is love him and pursue
[1:15:30] him with everything that's in me
[1:15:32] seeking knock keep pressing
[1:15:35] having not yet apprehended i'm pressing
[1:15:37] toward that mark of the high calling in
[1:15:39] christ jesus
[1:15:40] i saw something you know you all did too
[1:15:42] when you heard brother branham's voice
[1:15:44] for the first time you heard those
[1:15:45] sermons
[1:15:45] you saw jesus you know you did you saw
[1:15:48] truth you saw honesty
[1:15:50] you saw something you had never seen
[1:15:52] before
[1:15:53] but life difficulties people situations
[1:15:57] oh how it can cause you to cool off
[1:15:59] sometimes but you know what you had to
[1:16:01] take your eyes off jesus for that to
[1:16:03] happen
[1:16:04] you had to take your eyes off of the
[1:16:05] presence of god in the in the midst of
[1:16:07] the people
[1:16:08] and take your eyes off of him to see the
[1:16:10] problems
[1:16:11] you had to but god in his mercy he comes
[1:16:14] to you
[1:16:15] like he did to me why don't you stand
[1:16:19] let's have a word of prayer
[1:16:24] i pray that the simplicity of it
[1:16:28] means something to you if anything i
[1:16:32] just
[1:16:33] you know and i know and the kids know
[1:16:35] because they know what i preached before
[1:16:36] brother chad preached
[1:16:38] if god is wanting anything he wants
[1:16:40] sincerity
[1:16:41] he wants honesty he wants to be loved
[1:16:44] he doesn't need your formal works i
[1:16:48] don't even know so much if he's so
[1:16:49] concerned with your
[1:16:51] service if in the right term you have to
[1:16:54] take me in the right way
[1:16:58] but in your pursuit and your desire to
[1:17:02] do what he wants him to do because you
[1:17:04] love him
[1:17:04] not because you're pressured to do the
[1:17:06] right things because hey
[1:17:08] we all believe it right that's a badass
[1:17:11] that's a bad motivation i don't believe
[1:17:13] a sister should wear a dress because she
[1:17:15] doesn't be ostracized
[1:17:16] by the people she associates with i
[1:17:18] believe a sister should wear a dress
[1:17:19] because
[1:17:20] she wants to please god i believe a man
[1:17:23] who hears water baptism name the lord
[1:17:24] jesus christ
[1:17:25] i don't believe he does that because he
[1:17:26] doesn't want to be thought of bad no i
[1:17:28] believe something inside of him says
[1:17:30] i want to please god i want to do what
[1:17:32] he wants me to do i want to be what he
[1:17:33] wants me to be
[1:17:34] i love him i love him
[1:17:37] and when you keep that in its right
[1:17:39] perspective everything else falls right
[1:17:41] in line
[1:17:42] why don't we just bow heavenly father
[1:17:46] lord we come before you so thankful for
[1:17:47] this evening
[1:17:48] lord i'm thankful for your word how i've
[1:17:51] just enjoyed the day basking in it
[1:17:53] i so enjoy the fact that i know i'm in
[1:17:55] the presence of the king
[1:17:57] i so enjoy how your tender hand corrects
[1:18:00] us

[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:16] first
[1:20:26] [Music]
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:58] me
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:26] yes
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:39] oh praise god how many of you just want
[1:21:42] to love him more amen
[1:21:44] just want to express it and want him to
[1:21:46] know by our pursuit amen
[1:21:50] i just want god knows what's in your
[1:21:52] heart
[1:21:53] god knows what who you are but i still
[1:21:56] want to demonstrate my love amen
[1:21:59] god knows it i know he knows it but i
[1:22:01] think he enjoys
[1:22:02] seeing it amen and i think everything
[1:22:05] brother kyle went through
[1:22:07] and all his struggle and his questions
[1:22:09] and his quiet time with the lord
[1:22:11] i believe it was for me you believe it
[1:22:13] was for you
[1:22:15] one thing i realized more and more as
[1:22:16] brother kyle was preaching
[1:22:19] as we use terms of we when we preach we
[1:22:22] we speak collectively because we believe
[1:22:24] as individuals we all have the same
[1:22:26] desire and
[1:22:27] in the the same goals and the same faith
[1:22:30] and so we speak in collective terms a
[1:22:32] lot of times
[1:22:33] but what i realize more and more is
[1:22:35] really what god wants is me
[1:22:38] not the collective term but i he wants
[1:22:41] me he wants
[1:22:42] to love me and he wants me to love him
[1:22:44] back he wants a relationship with me
[1:22:46] he wants a love affair with me and i
[1:22:49] want to love affair personally with him
[1:22:51] with nobody else involved and it's
[1:22:55] it's about the individual we believe
[1:22:58] that
[1:22:59] god is good god is merciful
[1:23:03] and i truly want to love him more i was
[1:23:06] blessed by the message tonight and
[1:23:08] i sat there and marveled as i watched
[1:23:10] god do it again
[1:23:12] god and so many conversations that i've
[1:23:15] had and today in the last few days
[1:23:18] god was speaking right back to things
[1:23:20] that i needed
[1:23:22] conversations i had and things i needed
[1:23:24] to hear
[1:23:25] and i watched him do it again and he
[1:23:28] made himself
[1:23:29] known by the breaking of bread to me
[1:23:32] and i thank him for that man god bless
[1:23:36] you
[1:23:36] we love you we're going to let you be
[1:23:38] dismissed
[1:23:40] but let's just thank him quickly before
[1:23:41] we go lord we thank you
[1:23:43] i want to bow my head and i want to say
[1:23:45] thank you lord
[1:23:47] thank you for the reminder lord thank
[1:23:49] you for the direction
[1:23:51] thank you lord for stirring up within us
[1:23:53] that love that we have for you
[1:23:55] we know it's impossible that we could
[1:23:57] ever love you unless you first loved us
[1:23:59] and that speaks of predestination and
[1:24:01] election
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:03] without predestination and election in
[1:24:05] us we would never be able to love you
[1:24:07] back but oh god
[1:24:09] how much we love you and how thankful we
[1:24:11] are that you've called us
[1:24:14] that you've chosen us before the
[1:24:15] foundation of the world help us lord to
[1:24:17] stay in touch with that
[1:24:19] that revelation lord that uniqueness and
[1:24:22] the specialness lord that we have with
[1:24:24] you because of what you've done
[1:24:27] god help us never to cool off forgive us
[1:24:29] lord
[1:24:30] forgive us for letting the world
[1:24:32] distract us forgive us
[1:24:34] for letting other people become a
[1:24:36] distraction
[1:24:37] forgive us for our laziness lord and
[1:24:40] maybe not even for our laziness forgive
[1:24:42] us for our works when our works become a
[1:24:45] substitute for relationship
[1:24:47] help us lord not to go that way we're
[1:24:49] thankful that you spoke to us in a very
[1:24:51] intimate way tonight
[1:24:53] to remind us of our first love to remind
[1:24:56] us of what it is that you're after lord
[1:24:59] for you weren't after works but you're
[1:25:01] after love
[1:25:03] you're after a bride that will love you
[1:25:04] back knowing that with the right
[1:25:06] relationship
[1:25:07] all the right works will be in place
[1:25:11] god i just want to say you're my
[1:25:12] treasure
[1:25:15] you're my treasure lord god i pray that
[1:25:18] you would help us
[1:25:20] to keep you first in our lives we pray
[1:25:23] to bless our brother kyle
[1:25:24] to strengthen him lord that you would
[1:25:26] continue to use him for your glory and
[1:25:28] that you would restore unto him
[1:25:30] all that's been given out now for each
[1:25:33] one of us when we get
[1:25:34] may we leave here lord with our hearts
[1:25:37] centered on you with our
[1:25:38] affection centered on you lord may you
[1:25:41] just be what our eye
[1:25:43] is learning focusing on being trained to
[1:25:45] at all times
[1:25:47] not to be distracted by anything else
[1:25:49] religion formalism
[1:25:51] troubles whatever may come our way may
[1:25:54] none of those things move us lord but
[1:25:56] may our eye
[1:25:56] be focused singularly on you and may we
[1:26:00] never lose sight of you
[1:26:03] while we praise you and we thank you for
[1:26:05] your goodness to us
[1:26:07] and your blessings upon us may they are
[1:26:09] behind as we go from here lord
[1:26:12] go with us let us walk with you every
[1:26:14] day
[1:26:15] we ask these things in jesus christ's
[1:26:17] name
[1:26:20] amen amen i was
[1:26:22] speaking to brother franco today and i
[1:26:25] use this analogy and it's amazing
[1:26:29] i said i feel with the things that the
[1:26:33] lord has opened up and the things we've
[1:26:34] been ministering on lately
[1:26:37] i feel like a little lamb a little sheep
[1:26:40] surrounded by wolves and these wolves
[1:26:42] are all these demon
[1:26:44] spirits religious spirits and all kinds
[1:26:46] of other spirits
[1:26:47] that want to devour this little lamb
[1:26:51] and we're walking through the valley of
[1:26:53] the shadow of death
[1:26:55] but he says fear not for i am with thee
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:26:59] and this is the analogy that i just
[1:27:01] explained to brother franco i feel like
[1:27:03] it's a razor's edge because
[1:27:05] you could be so focused on the wolves
[1:27:08] that you lose all your joy
[1:27:10] you lose all your peace you lose sight
[1:27:13] of him
[1:27:15] but on the other hand you can be so
[1:27:17] content
[1:27:18] that i have a shepherd and i'm safe and
[1:27:21] i'm protected and everything's okay
[1:27:23] that you stop looking at him
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:26] and you get you get to the point where
[1:27:28] you say well i'm a sheep of his fold i'm
[1:27:29] special
[1:27:30] he watches over me and everything's fine
[1:27:32] with me and you failed to stay close to
[1:27:34] the shepherd
[1:27:35] and the shepherd's always moving
[1:27:39] and we can get so content every
[1:27:41] denomination has got so content
[1:27:43] they stop moving with the shepherd and
[1:27:44] as soon as they stop moving with the
[1:27:46] shepherd the wolves closed in
[1:27:50] amen we can never get to the place where
[1:27:52] we're so content that we don't have to
[1:27:54] constantly watch the shepherd and move
[1:27:56] when he moves
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:57] but if our eyes are on the shepherd and
[1:27:59] we move with him then we have joy amen
[1:28:01] we have peace we have delivered
[1:28:03] there's nothing to be worried about
[1:28:04] there's nothing to be afraid of there's
[1:28:06] nothing to fret over
[1:28:07] because the wolves can't get to you in
[1:28:09] the presence of the shepherd
[1:28:12] and i don't want to be so worried about
[1:28:13] the wolves that i forget that i'm in the
[1:28:16] presence of the shepherd and i don't
[1:28:17] want to be so content
[1:28:18] am i calling that i forget to look at
[1:28:20] the shepherd because i can get off
[1:28:22] either way
[1:28:24] but i just want to be happy and serve
[1:28:26] him and keep my eye focused on him and
[1:28:28] when he moves i move
[1:28:30] when he stops i stop and wherever he is
[1:28:33] i'm
[1:28:33] safe from all these forces that are
[1:28:36] trying
[1:28:36] to devour his sheep
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:41] say god has us right where he wants us
[1:28:45] completely dependent upon him
[1:28:49] that's where i want to be god bless you
[1:28:51] as we go this evening
