TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when something happened that was bad or or challenging Joseph would say God what part of the vision are you wanting to express now you remember that I may have the words a little wrong but what part of the vision are you wanting to express now I said oh what a perspective amen what a perspective when we hit life's trials and difficulties if we could just say God what part of your nature are you trying to express now now what I think should be expressed I sometimes I think the lion should come on the scene when God wants the lamb I think the lion should be there when God wants a sacrificial Ox yeah amen I think it should be the eagle who screams out amen from from Revelation and calls but maybe God wants an ox expression maybe a lion maybe the man maybe instead of me determining what should be respon maybe we should just say God what part of your life do you want to express today why is all this happening he said say why is all this happening to me God don't you know what's happening to me well of course he knows what's happening to you of course he knows where you're at and of course he knows the circumstances and situations instead of looking at it why God why all of this what's going wrong why not just say God what is it you're trying to accomplish today here I am an empty vessel do through me what you want to do with this circumstance because God brought a condition so that the genes on the inside would have an expression part of his nature part of his life it may be absolutely amazing and Supernatural and blow you away it may be as simple as submitting yourself and allowing your flesh to be destroyed both of those are expressions of the Life of Christ to speak a word to speak to the storm or to surrender to the beating it's not us to decide which portion it's him if we could just say like Joseph said what part of the vision what part of the word are you trying to express to me now God help me to stay tuned in and not interject my own thinking but just let you express through me and Friends there's a reality to this that God will do in you what he wants to do if we'll just get our own thinking out of the way what gives us problems is our mind but there's already a solution on the inside the genes are already there to over come oh let the circumstance bring expression because that's the purpose anyways say oh God let me have Joseph's attitude not I was wrong my vision was wrong I thought I was bride I thought I was a Son of God I must have been wrong no what God what is it you're trying to express now have your expression here
