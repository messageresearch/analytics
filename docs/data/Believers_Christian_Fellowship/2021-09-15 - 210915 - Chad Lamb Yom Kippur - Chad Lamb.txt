that's to magnify your glory and sing our the praises of how wonderful you are and give our thanksgiving to you and to hear from you lord what you would speak back to us we pray god now as we turn to the the breaking of bread to the preaching of the word we pray that you would take over lord you would take control of this vessel that's standing here as i surrender myself to you that by the power of your holy spirit you would take this gift you would lift it up lord and you would use it for your glory may you shape your living stones may you feed your sheep may you accomplish all that you desire accomplish in this evening service lord we give ourselves holy and completely unto you may you take preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen and while you're standing let's take our bibles and go to the book of leviticus chapter 23. leviticus chapter 23 and we'll read one portion of scripture out of leviticus and then we'll let you have your seeds leviticus 23 and 27. let me get there myself also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement it shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the lord god bless you as you have your seats may the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word keep your finger here we're going to we're going to go back to this scripture but i just want to give you an update on the passing of our brother john matthews sunday afternoon brother john passed away and i don't recall exactly what time it was that he passed away but it was in the afternoon and i was quite shocked because i had been to seam on saturday and on saturday was stable every indication that he was going to recover i felt like he was going to recover and and the medical staff did too that he was going to have to wear that mask for a few days but later i learned that somewhere along midnight on saturday night that brother john pulled his iv pulled his mask off and threw it to the side and wouldn't wear it anymore and then sunday afternoon his son-in-law come in and spoke with him and tried to encourage him to wear the mask and saying you're only going to have to wear this for a couple days and you'll be better they put the mask on on brother john and brother john took it off and he laid it to the side he said i'll be okay and that was it and i i realized when i heard that testimony when i heard that shared that our brother just had no desire to fight anymore he just had no will to fight and since his wife wilma had passed away brother john had longed to go to his heavenly home it was his desire to pass over and god gave him the desire of his heart and it's hard to mourn for somebody that wasn't sad for himself amen it's hard to mourn for somebody who got the desire of their heart and so we thank god that he's had that blessed reunion with his wife and he's happy and our brother's free and so they made the arrangements for the visitation and funeral for this friday it's going to be down in urbana the the vernon funeral home but they've they've limited it they wanted to limit it they don't want to have too many people so they asked that it would just be very close friends and family because brother john died of coven and some of the family had different exposure to him they just don't feel like amassing a big crowd right now so it's just going to be for family and those that were close to him but they would like to have a celebration of life memorial service for him later on october 9th here at the church where they can invite everybody we've got room here and by then everything will be settled out and the family will know how the covet issue will settle out so we can have it here october 9th at 10 30 in the morning so we'll be announcing that we'll have it on a flyer already i think out on the bulletin board so keep that in mind so we'll be able to celebrate the life of our brother and share testimonies and preach the word amen and as his family told me we want to have a long service so you can preach because brother john would want to hear preaching i say praise god amen and we'll preach what brother john liked to hear amen he liked to hear the message of the hour the word of this day the present tense truth and so we appreciate the family wants to honor him in that way and that'll be a blessing for us uh i want to go back here to leviticus 23 and pick up here in the scripture we read and there's a reason and some of you might know the reason that i went to the scripture today but leviticus 23 27 says also in the tenth day of the seventh month there shall be a day of atonement it shall be a holy convocation unto you and ye shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire and to the lord so we know that this is in the seventh month and this is in the cycle of jewish feast and the feasts they're the not the jewish feasts i'm sorry they're the feast of the lord and the lord established these through moses these seven feasts that would span the first seven months of their calendar of the religious calendar and in the seventh month amen which would be the sixth feast on the tenth day of the seventh month would be the feast of atonement and and they have a name for that called yom kippur and yom kippur means day of atonement and today happens to be yom kippur amen so i thought that was unique and that was kind of amazing and so i was meditating on this and and god was just really dealing with me so the jews are are celebrating yom kippur today but they can't celebrate it in the way that moses told them because they have no temple they have no high priest they have no holy place and on the day of jan capur was the day that the high priest that was selected by god of the right family would approach god the appropriate way and he would make an atonement uh he would make a sacrifice and put blood on the altar on the holy of holies and he would make an atonement for the for the sins of the entire nation and it was a huge event amen in the year because the the israelites the jews were given ways in which they could approach under god and when they had failed and when they had committed transgressions and iniquities they had sacrifices that they could bring amen but the day of atonement wasn't necessarily for those the day of atonement was for the sins of error or the sins of ignorance to cover even the things that the children of israel didn't know they were doing wrong so that they could be right with god so they had a high priest to intercede on their behalf and that high priest would come god's appointed way and he would be the appointed person and he would come with blood on that day and that day only the the day of atonement and he would sprinkle the blood amen upon the mercy seat and when he did that he was he was uh covering that atonement means to cover he was a covering or offering a purification for all of israel for all their sins for the whole year for everything that they did that they weren't even aware that they did and then everybody would wait outside amen they would be all the way outside even the outer court outside the outer curtain amen watching the gate on the eastern side because he was in there atoning for them amen he was in there appeasing god for them he was in there purifying all of their sins and they would watch on that day and when the high priest would go and do the ceremony and do everything he did when he would come in when he would emerge out of that tabernacle and he would step out the people would be relieved for now they know that their sins were gone they knew that they were clean they were covered for they were purified in the eyes of god and this cycle would repeat year after year after year and it would keep the nation of israel covered and clean and purified before god and god would accept them and dwell with them that was the that was the whole premise for setting up the day of atonement in the feast and the sacrifices and all of that but we know it was showing forth something that would come in the future we know that it was a shadow amen showing us bringing us to another reality and so on the day of atonement being probably the the most important day in the year for the israelites as a nation amen they they had this ritual year after year until 70 a.d when the temple was was destroyed and tore down by titus and since then they've been longing to come back because they want to be right with god not realizing that they've missed the high priest that have come to make intercession for them brother graham says in the feast of trumpets he says now there is the calling out time at the sixth seal when it opened the persecution struck the jews in the literal standpoint and here comes the persecution to the church in the ecclesiastical standpoint because the bride is already called the sabbaths are over and ready for the jews to be called whereto the feast of atonement oh church don't you see that called to the feast of atonement to recognize the atonement not no more chickens and geese and what they they've been doing the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the world israel israel is going to know that so brother i'm saying that there's coming a time that they're coming to their feast of atonement they're coming to the true feast of atonement when they're going to recognize what it was all about amen what they had been doing for for centuries centuries and generations with a tradition that they've been upholding what it was pointing to they're going to come and realize that and friends they're going to realize it really soon now as they're over in israel celebrating a yom kippur we know that there's one coming amen and it may not come on the exact day but there's one coming and it's coming through the witness of two prophets amen if we could pull up the white board brother franco i'm going to try to draw squiggly lines and then i'll tell you what they mean i had somebody tell you but the chat when you draw on the right white board if you didn't tell me what you were writing i'd have no idea what you were writing i said well praise god maybe i just do it for myself so i will interpret the squiggly lines but i just want to write down seven numbers so those are going to represent seven months and in this seven month period and god never changes his numbers he's going to complete a cycle of redemption in seven months in these feasts and the feast of the lord there's going to be seven of them but in the first month i'll draw a line here in the first month we're going to have three and it's going to be the feast of passover the feast of unleavened bread how do you spell 11 and the feast of first fruits those will be the first three feasts the last three feast over here is going to be the feast of trumpets the feast of atonement and the feast of tabernacles we've been through this many times but i'm just jotting it down so you have a visual aid a memory now in between there's five months the second third fourth fifth and sixth month when you come into the third month here you're going to have another one that's called pentecost and pentecost is weeks pentecost means weeks it's the feast of weeks it takes seven weeks to complete or seven weeks to come to the feast of pentecost but brother branham he does something like this he tells us that in between this time is the feast of pentecost that fills up this gap there's a gap in this feast if you can look at that there's always a gap if you look in prophecy all through the book of revelation there's a gap but in the gap the first part of this he has passover jesus christ comes to be the passover lamb he becomes the unleavened word that will be measured out through seven church ages and he is the first fruits of the resurrection and he he dies on passover day he lays in the grave at the beginning of the feast of unleavened bread and he resurrects on the first day of the week on the feast of first fruits so god does everything according to the pattern that he's laid down and then we know that 50 days later or seven weeks later we come to the feast of pentecost when when the holy ghost descends the pillar of fire comes into the upper room and breaks itself up and they're all have licks of fire when they're all filled with the holy ghost and that feast of pentecost spans those five months or we could look at it this way those number five is grace a measure of grace that has been given to gentiles and then there is going to take the seven the dispensation of the seven church ages are going to take place in this gap amen but at the end of the seven church ages he's going to come back to the feast of trumpets through the feast of atonement and to the feast of tabernacles and brother branham teaches us all of this and he lays it down and he explains all of this to us but but these are the feast of the lord showing redemption and you know we have to come to the passover lamb we have to recognize the unleavened bread of the word that's measured out in each age and we have to recognize that he was the he was the first fruits of the resurrection so it's not it's not that the the gentiles are are banned from this the gentiles partake in these feasts spiritually we partake in all these feasts spiritually and then the feast of pentecost is the grace that's injected in when he turns from the gentiles for rejecting or returns from the jews from rejecting him and now there's been a dispensation of gentiles for seven church ages and then he at the end of that he's going to turn back he's going to turn back to the jews but when as he turns back to the jews he is going to spiritually complete trump its atonement and tabernacles for the bride because we're going to go through that spiritually and then the jews are going to go through that as well amen the church ages won't go through that but those who are called out of the church ages will go through that so brother branham's telling us that we're at this time when he's at feast the feast of the tabernacles he said the sabbaths are over and ready for the jews to be called brother bill i'm telling we've come to the end of the gentile dispensation he keeps telling us that that's what he's saying we're at the end time we're at the end of the denominational age we're we're at the end of the gentile dispensation so we've come to the end the sabbaths are over ready for the jews to be called where to the feast of atonement and what calls them to the feast of atonement amen there's two prophets and those two prophets show up at the feast of trumpets the trumpets are calling the trumpets have been working the trumpets have been working because it's the it's the feast of trumpets that have been gathering the jews in this end time back to the homeland it's been happening for the last 70 some years the feast of trumpets have been having their effect drawing the jews back because those 144 thousand have to be birthed in the homeland so god is now in under this feast of trumpets he's been gathering back his jews and now the jews are in the homeland and they're ready for those two prophets to appear and the two prophets will appear under the seventh trumpet because under the seventh trumpet they will explain the trumpets what god's been doing how god's been gathering why they were dispersed and why all the things happened to them and why they've been gathered back and he's going to show them the grace of god that god has given them grace because they have rejected amen the the rejected the messiah they've been dispersed but by grace they've been regathered and under the seventh trumpet they're going to reveal to them all the trumpets and bring them to the feast of atonement and brother branham said the seven sabbaths the sabbaths are over and ready for the jews to be called he said this in 1964. where to the feast of atonement so brother of them tells us the sabbaths are over the jews are ready to be called where to the feast of atonement and so hold that in your mind it's a church don't you see called to the feast of atonement to recognize the atonement so he's not calling them to a feast of atonement to build a taber a tabernacle or a temple and go back into a holy blaze they're calling them to the feast of atonement to show them that jesus christ was the atonement amen he is atoned for your sins amen and he's done the work of intercession he's immediated for your sins and he's come now so that you can be introduced to the atonement that's what they're coming to he says again in feast of trumpets think of it it's the end time folks hallelujah the great day of the lord is at hand gather yourselves together feast of the messiah they'll reject him and they'll find out that there is that there is their messiah the bible said them striking things like this would take place in revelations 11 call their ministry will be the ministry of moses and elias calling to israel out of the jewish traditions so when these two prophets show up they're going to be showing up under the seventh trumpet to explain to them everything just lying mother baby said the seventh trumpet to the jews is the same thing the seventh seal is to us and the seventh seal to us is explaining christ the mystery of god revealed the mystery that laid under those seven thunders for all that time the mystery of the entire bible and the seventh trumpets to them will be the same thing that the seventh seal was to us bringing them to the true atonement now their ministry will be that of moses and elias and we'll be bringing them out of the jewish traditions that's what they were doing today friends today over in israel and around the world they were celebrating the jewish traditions of yom kippur amen and they were going back and reciting prayers and going to the synagogues for for times of prayer and recitations and reading of scriptures but these two prophets are going to come and unveil to them the whole mystery so that they understand what's been going on for the last 2000 years and who the messiah really is and they're going to bring them out of that tradition and bring them to the reality because today they had the tradition but soon they're going to have the reality there's a reason we're going into this because what god does for them amen god has done for us amen we've got to look back and see what god has done for us for his bride he's done for us what he's going to do for the 144 000. he said now i'm going to continue on he's calling to israel out of the jewish traditions just as the seventh angel's message called the bride out of the pentecostal tradition remember moses and elijah is to call israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice to the word so what what is this feast of atonement going to be they're going to recognize the word amen not anymore a tradition not any more a symbol amen not something that symbolizes something or foreshadows something they're going to come to the end of all the symbolism and all of foreshadowing and they're going to come face to face to the reality of what every symbol was pointing to what every feast was pointing to and they're going to come face to face with the word which brother bam says is the real living sacrifice and the seventh angel's message brother ben is paralleling these two things together so i want you to catch the parallel because we can say oh there's going to be two prophets show up those two prophets show up is going to show up under the seventh trumpet to reveal to them the trumpets how god redeemed how god brought him out how god watched over him what god did how he got him to the land what god's doing amen the mystery of christ through the bible and you're going to bring him to the feast of atonement which is the real living word the real living sacrifice the word he's going to do that but brother branham is showing a parallel what we can see what's going to happen to them but let's open our eyes and see what's already happened to us this has already happened for us the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the pentecostal and world tradition to the genuine atonement the what did this prophet come to do in the end time the prophet come to explain to us the trumpets what were the trumpets the seven gospel trumpets amen that were gathering the elect through the church ages he comes and sounds them all and gives us the interpretation begins to show to us that god has been gathering his elect through trumpets and then what does he do after he reveals that he brings us to the real living sacrifice to the word amen no more a church tradition no more a repeating of a word or no more of a going through symbolisms no more going through rituals but he brings us face to face with the real atonement the one that atoned for us the living word amen not a word from long ago but the present tense living word and brings us in contact with the atonement this is why to miss this is to miss everything [Music] because you know we want to say that what worked in previous ages was good and what worked in previously what worked in previous ages was good in the age that it worked in and it was the way god was drawing his people and the way god was revealing himself and the way god was working amen but but now when when we go beyond that and to the next dispensation we cannot rest back in the in the revelation of a previous dispensation and saying all will be well with me all is not well with you because if you don't move into the real living sacrifice the word and then you stay back here you're rejecting the atonement and you're staying impartial and not moving to the fullness and the fullness has come amen we're not waiting it's here amen the real living sacrifices come is among us i mean we've been introduced to the atonement jesus christ the lamb of god alive amen and present and now we cannot rest in previous dispensation and we cannot tell other people you're fine in previous dispensation because god he laid out the plan in the feast amen and god when he laid out this plan was showing that i know exactly what i'm going to do i've already planned that this is my plan of redemption this is how i'm going to re redeem this is the plan this is the pattern so that when it happens you'll recognize that this is me because i've already foreshown the plan and so now we're standing in this day where we can look at the plan and say i've gone through here i've gone through here i've gone through here i've gone through here i've gone where am i i hope by the end of this service you're gonna know where you are in the feast of the lord because we're not jews and we're not pentecostals so where are we if you're not pentecostal then the sabbaths are over the feast of pentecost is over if you're not a jew then you're not in the feast of trumpets because that's where the jews are so what are you i'm bride where's the bride i hope as we go along the lord will reveal it through the prophet the seventh angel's message i'm continuing the same quote from the feast of trumpets the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seals to what to call the people the bride out of the pentecostal world tradition to the genuine atonement the word christ impersonating in his word here made flesh among us what are you looking for the real genuine atonement what is it the word christ impersonating his word here made flesh among us i'm looking for the atonement i'm looking for the atonement brother i've just told you where the atonement has come to now it's the ministry of jesus christ himself the son of man the word amen now a made flesh among us that the the atonement the person of the atonement the lamb of god the word of god amen has returned back into the church that's the real living sacrifice the word that's the genuine atonement the word christ impersonated his word made flesh among us science has proved it by pictures if brother branham says science has proved it by pictures what are you looking for because brother branham's saying it's past it's history amen it's already been proved by the pictures praise god i love the word it's been proved by pictures the church knows it the world around we firmly know it for he's never told us one thing and thus saith the lord but what's been the truth did he not say down there on the river as john the baptist was sent so will this message so he stops there what will this message do forerunner's second coming brother branham's saying the pictures have proved it the atonement has come the person of the word the real living sacrifice has come in the message the indictment the prophet of god says and that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice see i don't care if you're a methodist baptist presbyterian if you can forget your differences roman catholic whatever you might be and will come under the shed blood god will meet with both of us there that's where we can all meet and fellowship on the same grounds but otherwise he will not meet just because you're a methodist he will not meet just because you're a pentecostals he will meet with you under one condition that's under the shed blood when your sins has been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he only can see you through that shed blood and you're white as snow see when you've confessed your sins otherwise you're not there you cannot fellowship that's the reason that you don't see things happening in the churches they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word this is an important statement that brother ben's making he's saying you're seeing in this day why things aren't working amen because they confess we believe the blood we believe the blood you've got to be under the blood you must have the blood the blood of jesus saves us and purify we like all of christianity knows that so you can express to all of christian them and express to them how what's the means of salvation by the blood where's purification under the blood where are my sins washed away under the blood then ask the question how do i get under the blood that's when you'll start to hear a myriad of of answers but i'll tell you how to get under the blood the most simplest way to get under the blood is to believe the word amen to believe him amen to receive him as he is to receive the i am amen so everybody wants to be under the blood by saying i'm under the blood and is god obligated to your definition of under the blood when the churches have rejected the plan to get to the blood which is the word now we're going to find out what this means as we keep moving forward because brother branham is explaining himself through the message like you know sometimes when you're just reading the message and going along brother bennett says some things and they sound so odd especially when you first come to the message and like i don't understand what he means by that statement and i just tell you stay in the message he explains it amen he's got his own way of seeing it in his own way of explaining it and what is he doing he's explaining his revelation of what god has showed him how this word has come to pass what the word is in our day and he's using whatever means he has at his exposure his language and his terms to explain it just keep reading in the message the token he says today is the calling out of the bride out of the church the exodus for the rapture for the church truly goes through the tribulation period as you pentecostal brothers has preached i believe that the church goes through it but not the bride no sir someone discussing that with me not long ago said the church will have to go through for a purification i said that is the truth because she rejected the blood no she doesn't believe she rejected the blood if you go now we don't know who's foolish virgin and not foolish versus not like you can go up to somebody with a label foolish version and ask them a question but just in a way of an analogy if you would ask somebody who was foolish virgin are you under the blood yes i'm under the blood but if you're under the blood you don't wind up in tribulation so if you wind up in tribulation you're not under the blood if you wind up in tribulation you've rejected the blood now they didn't reject that jesus christ died 2 000 years ago for the sins of the world they didn't reject that they didn't reject his blood was the price of redemption that's not what they rejected so what was rejected amen i'll tell you what was rejected the i am was rejected the same one that was in moses's day for salvation the same one that was a noah's day for salvation the same one that was in paul's day for salvation it was always the same one for salvation always the same person always the same means always the same mechanism and is always believing the i am and now they've rejected the i am who is the word they rejected the path to the blood which is the word so she must go through tribulation for purification because he's rejected the blood because the blood is our purification but if the tribulation period catches the bride his own wife in the tribulation no sir the blood of jesus christ has cleansed us from all sin and there is no more purifying and the blood of jesus christ and that token as identification that it has been purified so brother branham is preaching the token and he's showing us that the token is the evidence of the purification we'll get into that too i want to read a quote here out of the invisible union of the bride of christ it says he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of water what what is the bride received by the blood purification what is the token evidence of that she's been purified how is she going to be purified she brother is telling us in the invisible union how the bride is purified and the difference why the foolish virgin must give their lives in tribulation because they have to give their they have to give their life for purification because they rejected the blood but the bride has been purified by the blood so she does not have to go to tribulation she spared from tribulation because she's been purified by the blood is that clear so let's look at what brother branham says and shows about purification of the bride and invisible union of the bride of christ see he put it in the sea of forgiveness by the washing of water of the word and the blood of life that's what the bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which forward daniel has washed you by the washing of the water by the church congregation says no that don't sound right does it no you might find that in the almanac but not in god's bible by the washing of water by the word in the word see you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning brother branham was talking about the purification that brings a true justification to the bride and he's talking about a washing of the water of the word and then you have to say but i thought the bride was purified by the blood he hasn't changed his mind amen stay with him i thought it was the blood that's what he's talking about but he's saying word [Music] he's a prophet of god he knows what he's talking about amen by the washing of the water by the word in the word see you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a minute are you standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen that every every jot every tittle that means the full word where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks and get out here in the weed where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah talk about a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect he drops down a couple paragraphs and he says you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it praise god that's how effective this washing is in this end time amen that's what's been given to the bride at the end time that can wash such a purification that a prophet of god can look at you and say this bride if you're standing with the word and you're standing on the word every jot every tittle what's he saying there's no more unbelief amen you're not i'm the an unbeliever of the word but the full word has come and you're standing with the full word you believe it you've received it you've submitted to it he says you're perfect amen and he's not talking about you know the little mistakes that you make and he's not talking about you've come to sinless perfection and you'll never make another blunder brother venom is not talking about that because he says otherwise later but what he's talking about is the condition of your soul your condition before god because you've come to the i am you've come to the atonement amen himself and when you come to that atonement the full word that is coming this day through a prophetic ministry you said that's nothing but the truth i believe it i give my whole life to it and that word washed you from all the sins of unbelief in your life and in your heart and he says you're sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ you never did it in the first place because this original word comes to awaken an original seed inside of you and under the washing of the original word it takes that seed to its original condition and brings it to life and that seed never did it in the first place that seed was part of god part of god's thinking it never was in sin to begin with and the washing of the water of the pure word washes everything away from that seed and springs it to life in an original form which is pure god washes away all the evil all the misconceptions all the wrong doctrines and wrong understandings it brings a purification he's not saying that your flesh is now pure no your flesh is redeemed he's not saying your mind is now pure that spirit will go and be no more someday but what he's saying is i've washed you back to the original this word has washed away all the hybrid this word has washed away all the unbelief and it's quick in that original scene you're perfect he says you never sinned at the first place it's in the sea of forgiveness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god when the devil comes and get in your mind it's time for you to get in god's vines [Applause] because in god's mind it's not there praise be to god you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with the pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood i thought he said he washed it in the water of the word he did now he washed it in the water of his own blood he did how many times you've been washed it's the same washing that become flesh the washing of the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was you catching that why is he doing this so he can come and gather you to himself you who were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was you were predestinated the same way he was he was that great attribute of god called love so if he was that great attribute of god called love then you're part of that love and that's why you're a recipient of grace john 1 14 we know it well it says and the word was made flesh that word that was made flesh is the word that became the sacrifice and that word that became sacrifice had the life of the word and it had blood and that that word when it was made flesh had blood had created blood of god in it and when that word was nailed to a cross when that word was beaten when that word was stabbed with the spirit that word bled was jesus christ the word made flesh was he for the full word made flesh what was it all the word at all dispensations in all time made flesh well then if all the word and all times and all dispensations is made flesh then that word bled so when moses begins to preach a portion of the word moses is preaching a portion of the word there's an elect seed that will believe what moses is preaching and by believing what moses is preaching they'll have righteousness imputed unto them and declared righteous not because they do everything perfect but because they believe the i am and so now as time moves on they go and they they lay in a grave amen and now you come to a next dispensation you know in jeremiah's day and in elijah's day you go through each of these dispensations and there was always an elected of god that would believe the present tense word the i am and they would believe that and then righteousness would be imputed unto them and then they would lay away in a grave and they were laying there waiting for something amen they were waiting for that word that they believed to bleed for them what what was bleeding on the cross the word that they believed in this day was made flesh in that vessel the thing that they they saw as god the thing they said that's the truth the thing they said i'll give my life for the thing that they stake their salvation on the very thing that they recognize is the i am the word of god amen my portion they grabbed a hold of that they believed it with all their heart amen and when they believed it with all their heart that word that they believed became flesh one day and was nailed it was a sacrifice and that word bled for them and because they believed that word when it bled for them they were atoned for and that's why when jesus resurrected all those saints who believed the i am resurrected with him because now the word that they believed now was shedding blood i hope you understand this i hope it's not too far too abstract to catch the word that they were believing was now paying a price of redemption was now becoming purification to cover for all of them amen and now because the word that they believed had been made flesh and died for them now when jesus resurrected they resurrected because everything was paid for in christ that's why oh i don't want to get into that right now i'll get that to a minute in the invisible union again he says what is sin sin is unbelief and what the word unbelief in god which is the word that's as simple a definition as we can get can't simplify it that's it pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you you understand that now now do you understand what brother branham's saying the word bled for you so the word of justification that luther's day would believe in was bleeding on the cross and that word was bleeding for them because come down the road there's going to be a dispensation of time when god is going to open a seal and break a revelation to a church age messenger and it's going to be the revelation of justification by faith and justification by faith already bled so when they come to the dispensation where god opens justification by faith that is the i am that is the word for their day that is the present tense word and when the elect of god see it they say that's nothing but the truth i'll sacrifice my whole life i'll stake everything i have on that truth and when they when they sacrificed everything they had on that truth that word had already bled for them already purified them and now they come into their purification by the blood by the washing of the water of this word that had already bled for them this is why brother brahm says what he says he says why he's using the terminology he's using that's why in luther's day you could not reject luther's message because it was the i am it was the fountain that was open in that day for washing and cleansing and purification in wesley's day there was a message of sanctification that broke open god had broken another seal of revelation and now the church age messenger was giving out another dispensation of truth and that was another part of the word that had held on calvary i hope we don't look at the word as black words on paper and say i gotta agree with this doctrine and agree that the word is a person amen the word is god amen god was the word the word was with god the word was god amen we're not talking about we're not talking about fragments of sentences and pronunciations and things that come off of human lips we're talking about the very thoughts of god when they're moving in the manifestation is the word and it is god amen and it you cannot reject god and now this word bled for us so that when the word was presented to us and whatever day that we live the portion of the word that was coming forth the part of the fountain that had sprung open and now was spurting out clean water for purification now the place to receive purification from stands is under that fountain well brother branham would call the fresh kill of the word where the blood is because if that word had already bled and now that word is coming into its manifestation and it sees it and it's opening up a fresh kill of the word with blood in it he says i want to read this again on an invisible union of the bride of christ so we can catch him washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed and bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you so the life of god was in the word and the word bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word we have to be washed we have to be washed of the filth of the prostitute spirits but we have to be washed by the bleeding word now let's turn to first john chapter one i hope all of these things that the prophet has said over the years become richer and richer and clearer and clearer as we keep moving on first john 1 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin so where does this washing and cleansing take place if we walk in the light as he is in the light so as he is in the light as present tense i am so wherever the light is we walk in the light as he is in the light amen the present tense word the present tense illumination the present tense revelation if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin why because the light is the word and the word bled for us and if we walk in the light as he's in the light there's a fountain of blood that's flowing for cleansing these aren't just odd statements it's all it's all leading to the same thing amen brother brahma says in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light and to you man that's listening to this across the world wherever you may be there is something wrong with your experience when you say that you love god and refuse his word there is something you refuse the very no wonder the things the church is in its condition and things cannot be done as god promised is because you won't even receive the word or walk in the light the bible says let us walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of jesus christ god's son cleanses us from all sin sin is unbelief brother branham he comes back to this and he's using this scripture and he's not talking about it's going to cleanse you from smoking and cleanse you from bad language and cleanse you from all of that those are all side effects of sin those are all things that are hanging on to sin but if we walk in the light as he is in the light so we walk in revelation as he is in present tense revelation walking in the presence of the i am amen then the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin sin is unbelief why are you cleansed from unbelief because you're receiving the word for your day you're not disbelieving god the i am when he's made manifest before you you now you are free from unbelief amen because you have believed god and it's imputed unto you for righteousness then continue on the same quote then if we are walking in the god-given light of the hour then god takes that word that's given for the hour and vindicates for walking in god-given light of the hour that's so key and the message the token he says as we see the great end time signs on the earth today we know that that's right that that's right now look i've waited for this for a long long time for this message to you what message the token brother branham's waited for a long long time to preach the token he could not preach the token until this time when's he preached a token he preaches it september 1st 1963. what happened in 1963 in 1963 you have the cloud appear you have brother brown get caught up in a constellation of angels you have the opening of the seven seals the preaching of the seven thunders you have christ as the mystery of god revealed you have the indictment and now he comes along after all this has transpired something has shifted dynamically in the first part of 1963 and after a dynamic dispensational shift he comes and he said i've waited a long long time to preach this but now i'm going to preach the token so what is the token it's the literal life of jesus christ in you he said i've had to wait to preach this to wait for this dynamic shift to take place i've waited this for a long long time for this message to you and you've seen the end time signs and i've preached it to you and showed it to you but everything that christ said is that right you'll admit that we're at the end time i don't see nothing left so this is the time that brother brenham can preach the token we've come to the end time i don't see nothing left now we can preach the token again in the token he preaches in 1964 a different token message he says there you are the blood the blood the token not the blood chemistry but the token the holy ghost the life out of the blood not the chemistry amen in in a token he's always typing with the passover amen when they took the passover lamb and they slayed and they took the blood and they painted on the on the lentil in the doorpost amen it was a sign that a lamb had died and there was an outward sign on the outside of this house that there's now an application of blood showing that the lamb has died for this house and we are inside feasting on the lamb that's what all of that represented so the token was the blood on the outside showing that a lamb had died for this house and they were eating the lamb that's what the token meant and brother branham's preaching a token that can only be preached at the end time when there's nothing else left and that token is going to be a display amen that in this house a lamb has died for this house and in this house they're feasting on the lamb and that house is you he said the token not the blood chemistry so now brother behind saying not the chemistry that came out of the blood that chemistry that came out of jesus veins brother branham said it dripped into the judean soil and went back to the elements it came from so when you talk in a denomination a way about an application of the blood what blood how is it applied where do you get it and how do you put it on yourself how do you strike it on the lenthil in the doorpost when that blood that was shed went into the judean soil and turned back into the minerals is made out of what blood are we talking about to have an application it's not the chemistry of the blood it was the life that was in that blood and that blood when it was broken and shed released the life which was the life of god and that life came back at pentecost and broke itself up in the tongues of fire and went into his body amen which is the church and now they have the literal life of jesus christ but the church would begin to fall amen and compromise on the word and we know that the holy ghost is the life of the word and the blood life is the life of the word the blood the word was made flesh and blood but the life in that blood was the life of the word so the life of the word when you begin to compromise on the word you begin to limit the life of the word brother brahm says this we're going to get into it so as the church ages begin to fall under nicholatenism and man began to rule over the church and begin to compromise on the word and change it what they were doing is they were limiting the life that was in the blood from the people brother benham tells us that the holy ghost has been bound by these denominational rivers but it's going to be loose what bound the holy ghost it was the denominational rivers so there had to be a time at the end time when there was nothing else left that brother branham could preach the token [Music] that life back in the house on the house not limited but in fullness the blood the chemistry but the token the holy ghost the life out of the blood that comes what does that life does comes and confirms what the token has been purchased for the token confirms the blood bought you bought for you the blood purchased your redemption the token is the evidence of it the blood he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed see all blood blood blood then when the token comes it shows that you've been identified with that sacrifice again in another token message 1964 he says now therefore the blood itself understand now the red chemistry chemicals of the blood had to stand out on the door as a token that the lamb had died now because the life of the lamb could not come back on the human worshiper but today see it was only a type today it isn't the chemical blood of the lord jesus our lamb but it's the life that was in that blood which is the holy ghost which is the life of the word it comes back and is the token that you have accepted and did exactly what god told us to do and then by having the token we are identified with our sacrifice perfectly i don't see how anything more could be any plainer then in the token and preached in september of 63 he says the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days and then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time you get it the token never come into existence until the evening time now brother branham is trying to show us this is the evening time amen it shall be light in the evening time this is the time of the setting of the sun on the gentile dispensation this is the time of the evening time amen for the for this world amen the evening time for the denominationalism the evening time but the token never come into existence until the evening time and this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me this is the evening time of my message i'm dying i'm going i'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel and we've come up through justification and so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied brother braham said it come into existence in the evening time what is the token the life of jesus christ in you manifesting out from you a sign that you've been a a recipient of that blood that you've been identified with your sacrifice that you've been purged and you've been cleaning he says again in the token it's been the lamb all the way through it was the lamb and luther's time it was the lamb in wesley's time but now is the token time that each house must be covered by the token brother man makes an interesting statement he said it was the lamb and luther's time and it was the lamb in wesley's time and and what's different about that than our time was it not the lamb now yes it's the lamb it's the life of the lamb they in luther's time was looking back to the lamb wesley's time was looking back to the lamb but now the life of the lamb has come not impartial but in fullness the full life of the lamb has come now it's token time it's not partial time it's the life that was released when that blood was shed now when the fullness has been unlocked and unleashed to come back upon the church again and he says this he says now now it's token time that each house must be covered by the token each house of god must be covered by the token all that's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of god is the body of jesus christ and by one spirit we're all baptized into this token and become part of it that god said when i see this token displayed i'll pass over you what an hour that we're now living so the token must cover your house my house let's go to leviticus 25. just have a couple more things i'd like to read as we wrap up leviticus 25. leviticus 25 and i'm going to read verse 9. then shall thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land every seven sabbaths or every 50 years there would be a special day of atonement and on this day of atonement they would blow the jubilee trumpet and when they blew the jubilee trumpet it was a sign of freedom everything that was bound or enslaved or all of your inheritance that had been sold now comes back to its rightful owner so not every atonement did that but after after 50 years then on the day of atonement when the high priest would go in and when he would pay the price and he would cover for the sins of air then there would be a blowing of a jubilee trumpet and now everybody that had been sold in slavery goes free and everybody that had sold their land and given up part of their inheritance they get it all back amen so there's a special atonement that comes every once in a while and that atonement comes with a jubilee this is what the jews are about ready to get they're about to come through the feast of trumpets through those two prophets those two prophets are going to bring them through the feast of trumpets and bring them to the feast of atonement and this is a feast of atonements going to be a special atonement friends it's going to be the feast of atonement with a jubilee trumpet and everything they lost given us been taken from them it's all going to be restored to them in this atonement but remember what we can see will happen for them has already happened to us friends there's already been a feast of atonement in this day there's been a trumpet blast that's went forth and that trumpet blast is restored to us all the denominations are taken away all of our inheritance that we're lost and all the slavery that we've been bound in under traditions of men and dogmas of men we have been set free under this atonement that has come in this day brother branham says in the feast of trumpets he said the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it listen when they were sitting there on yom kippur and today being yom kippur they would sit outside the tabernacle in the wilderness and they would watch the gate that was to the east and they were watching for that high priest to come out because he had to go in that high priest was not a perfect high priest so he had to go twice first to offer for himself so that he could be purified and then he would take the offering in for the people so he would go in once and they would watch him come out then they were relieved because now he's going to be an intercessor for us then he would go back in and that's when they would hold their breath because if he didn't if god did not accept it then they were not accepted if god did not accept the atonement then their sins weren't atoned they still were bearing their sins they were not free so they would watch for him to come and when when he would begin to come amen he was coming from the west to the east because they were standing on the east watching the gate there's to the east they were standing there watching him come from the west to the east and when he would come out then all of a sudden the relief we're free we're free we're free you can sound the jubilee our sins are covered for we are clean we are purified we are free in 1963 brother branham heard a blast that came out of the west coming to the east and he saw a constellation of seven angels and what appeared in the seven angels when he was told to turn the picture to the right he turned and he said it's jesus christ he said it's our lord up there amen everybody was back east he left all the brethren back east what were they watching for they were watching from melchizedek to come again from behind the veil and when melchizedek come from behind the veil you can say i'm free i'm free i'm free this is my atonement i am covered all the sins of ignorance all the sins of unbelief it's all been atoned for now and i'm free the atonement is coming to me amen brother banham preached to us the trumpets the seven gospel trumpets to bring us to the feast of atonement in 1963 when melchizedek would come back from behind the veil when the lord himself would come showing that our our sins of ignorance have been atoned for all the ignorance to the church ages and all the misconceptions and not even knowing where we were before the foundation of the world or what happened in the garden of eden or what where who we really are and the attribute of god and where we're really going all the misunderstanding he come out from behind there and said it's all been paid for it's all been covered now this is a jubilee atonement everything you're lost comes back to you amen and from that atonement he comes to feast the tabernacles because where did that high priest go did he go back that high priest now came into tabernacles of flesh he came into your booth in my booth our tabernacles of flesh to dwell on this earth in his body now many mini-membered body we go to levitt leviticus 23 and 34. read this speaking to the children of israel saying the fifteenth day of the seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the lord on the first day shall be a holy congregation you shall do no servile work therein seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord and on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein at the end of the seven days there's an extra day a great day it's called in john 7 the great day of the feast when jesus stood up in the midst in the temple and cried all who are thirsty come to me and drink and out of thy belly shall flow rivers of living water that was on this eighth day this great day brother ram says in the message the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride he says to an old man and an old woman don't you be discouraged if you are represented up here in this attribute of god this god if you have it if you're represented here you cannot you're in the eternal and you've crossed from the seventh day into the eighth are you in god is god in you have you crossed from the seventh day to the eighth oh praise god moved out of the card onto the supernatural moved out of time into eternity that's what's been made available at the end of this dispensation of time he says now if you cross from the seventh day into the eighth you got into the eternal by the baptism of the holy spirit you're included in this now if you're just trusting upon a sensation or jumping up and down or do this i keep my sabbath day i don't eat meat and things like that that's going to perish anyhow see but this is the eternal this is the eternal the feast after the feast of tabernacles what's the feast after the feast that eighth day feast the eighth day brings you into eternity or back to the first day again or back to original life the feast of tabernacles was the last feast the seventh feast we are worshiping now under the feast of tabernacles the seventh church james that's what the prophet said so where are we at at the end of the seven dispensations in the seventh church age the seventh month the seventh church age at the end of the sabbath you come to trumpets the seven gospel trumpets you come to atonement melchizedek coming out behind the veil and you come to tabernacles god dwelling in vessels and at the end of the seventh that great day jesus cries with a loud voice all that's thirsty come to me amen why did he cry it because he was there he was present in the seventh feast he said come unto me and drink and out of your belly shall flow lit rivers of living water and he was speaking of the holy ghost that would come brother said we're worshiping now under the feast of tabernacles the seventh church age in the millennium will be under the feast of tabernacles again now we're in it spiritually there will be in time in the seventh day but then after the seventh day we have a holy convocation go back into eternity how by the eternal one that came and redeemed us and taken us back letting us recognize that we are part of this now how do you know you're a part because the word of the hour the promise of the day what is it a restoration back to the first day the first and he shall restore the hearts of the children back to the fathers bringing a restoration again of the pentecostal genuine not sensations and will manifest the evening light the same sun that showed in the morning light as promised for the day amen amen where are we friends that's what i want to ask you at the end of the service where are we friends we are here in the last day of the great feast we're in the eighth day we've moved from time into eternity by the baptism of the holy ghost because the token has come in the evening time the full life come with the full word when the restraints of denominations were taken away when the rivers of denomination was breached and dried up amen and he come across amen and you saw you saw melchizedek come out from behind the veil showing that it's been paid for you're free this is your jubilee take it all you can have all your inheritance back and he's coming in full measure to live in tabernacles and we've come to the feast at the end of the feast of tabernacles because the dispensation of seven church ages is now over and now we who've received this life that's in this message the life of jesus christ have moved into that great day of the seventh feast and we're moving in one by one i hope you can understand this i say we've moved in god deals with the gentiles as individuals he deals with israel as a nation when they move into the feast of tabernacles they move in at once amen when they come to the feast of atonement they come in at once amen when they come through the the trumpets they come at once you come as an individual god revealed to you the trumpets amen when you heard the seven gospel trumpets in the end time god brought you to the feast of atonement when you recognize the word the living sacrifice the true atonement and when christ come to live in you the feast of tabernacles it was an individual and you individually moved into the eighth day so where are we we're in the last great feast the seventh church age waiting for all the elect of the gentiles to move into the eighth day the holy convocation and when the last one moves into that holy convocation in the eighth day then there's going to be another change brother sam's brother ben says where are we friends where are we just waiting now to get out of the way so revelations 11 can be made known to the jews that's right the rapture coming where are we we're down here in the great convocation we may not not all the elect has come yet because of all the elect come yet amen there would be a pressure that would come on that would squeeze us right out of here amen and bring the jew the two uh witnesses in revelations 11 to the 144 000 but we're moving one by one into the great day of the seventh feast we're moving one by one i mean we're coming through those seven trumpets amen revealing the seven church ages bringing us into the feast of atonement the living sacrifice of the living word amen brought back to us moving in the tabernacles as you become one with the token and the token is on you moving into that great holy convocation waiting for that last one to move into the holy convocation what are we waiting for to get out of the way what's happening you're standing in the way brother brim says and recognize your day and its message now 2700 years since that time and the third day will be gathered again after two days and the third day will be gathered again brother branham is getting this out of the book of hosea hosea chapter 6. i'm just going to turn there and read it you can turn if you like or i'll just read it to you but in hosea chapter 6 there's a prophecy that's laid and brother ben is referring to that right here hosea 6-1 come and let us return unto the lord this is about returning to the lord and this is for the jews come let us return for the lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he is smitten and he will bind he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his side brother bam gets to this and he says see it's been almost 3 000 years we're in that we're well into the third day from this prophecy this prophecy was 780 years before bc before christ and here we are 2000 now 2021 after so we're we're well into the third day of this prophecy he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth as prepared as the mourning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and the former rain unto the earth that's that's the prophecy brother ben is referring to here in recognizing your day and its message he said he said in the third day we'll be gathered again after two days and the third day we'll be gathered again and receive life in his sight do you see the promise the hour perfectly wrote on the wall we see where we are living now in the homeland waiting for the feast of trumpets or the recognition of the atonement who's he speaking of he's speaking of the jews that'll be birthed as a nation the 144 thousand now in the homeland waiting for the feast of trumpets they're waiting for the feast of trumpets but before the feast the trumpet starts everybody has to come every gentile elected predestined gentiles got to move into this eighth day and and when they all move into the eighth day they've got to get out of the way so that the feast of trumpets can break forth on 144 000. so where are we that's where we are friends in the homeland waiting for the feast of trumpets or the recognition of the atonement and to wait for the coming to mourn for the rejection of the first time that they rejected it they're in the homeland for that waiting what are they everything is positionally placed brother branham as a prophet of god he's telling you everything's in position he's saying we've come to the end time it's the evening time the evening live everything is here ready waiting everything's impositionally placed as a minister of the gospel i can see one i can't see one thing left but the going of the bride and the bride has got to be taken away before they can recognize what happened they cannot come to the feast of atonement till the bride is taken out of the way the bride has to be taken away before they can recognize what happened they were bound scattered i mean they were scattered blinded and now gathered what's left the bride to be taken out of the way waiting for the going of the bride so their prophets of revelation 11 can call them to the feast of trumpets to to make them to recognize what they have done where are we friends what are we waiting for what did the prophet tell us to wait for he said i can't see anything left but they're going away of the bride and she's going up word by word one by one moving into the rapture one by one moving into the great day at the end of the seventh feast into the holy convocation moving into eternity amen being raptured up and lifted up out of denominationalism and being connected back with god one by one until the last one comes in then they'll all be taken out of the way so that they can come to the recognition the jews can come into the recognition of what they've done it's all done it's finished the prophet did what he was supposed to do we're moving in one by one by revelation upon the word the message has been given to us we're here to preach it and it's truth we're here to we're here to preach it pure under the pure washing of the word amen to bring every predestinated seed into this position and when the last one comes into this position she's taken out of the way amen and the feast of atonement breaks open on the 144 thousand that's what we're supposed to be doing not sitting on our heels waiting for god to do something he's done everything friends this is where we're at where are we in prophecy this is where we're at where are we in redemption this is where we're at let's go find the last predestinated seed let's preach a pure word that opens people's eyes under the washing of a pure word amen not a polluted word you can't get clean under a polluted word amen to preach a pure word amen preach a real living sacrifice a real atonement and present a real atonement to the people so they can unite with their headship they can unite with their melchizedek they can come one with the atonement and they can move into the feast of tabernacles where that atonement now lives in them then they can get caught up into the eighth day and one by one we get out of the way one by one we get out of the way until the last one gets out of the way and then they're all out of the way and then god breaks forth on the 144 000 i hope you're as excited as i am you see the news you see what's going on all over you see you see the jews gathering in the persecution that's rising against them the pressure they're under oh we should get so absolutely excited amen because he cannot break forth the revelation to them till you and i get out of the way that's where we're at that's how close we are he's got to get us out of the way and we're not going to get out of the way till that last one moves into that great day of the seventh feast let's preach a word amen that somebody can grab a hold of and move and rapture out of their condition into a heavenly realm let's preach a word that brings somebody out of denominationalism brings them out of a pentecostal tradition and brings them to the atonement and brings the tabernacle of god on earth again in them let's preach that kind of word not a wishy-washy everybody's okay just love the lord let's preach a word amen that brings us into the eighth day brings them in through the feast of atonement into the feast of tabernacles into the holy convocation [Applause] let's get people out of the way let's preach the gospel that gets people out of the way caught up word by word one by one until the final one then we get out of the way and god can reveal himself like joseph did to his brethren through the ministry of two prophets moses and elijah then they can follow the same path that you've just been through they can come through feast of atonements through prophet two prophets a prophetic message that reveals to them what's been going on through the trumpets brings them in contact with the living sacrifice the word and brings them into union with that word and and takes care of the rest of the redemption story oh god is good friends let's all stand god is good the prophet come to tell us who we are and he also come to tell us where we are if you don't know where you are we get distracted with all kinds of things of the world we start playing games and playing around and getting distracted and running to and fro because we don't realize where we are and we won't realize what's waiting for the next step to transpire and we forget our commission and we forget our calling when you know where you are and you know who you are you know what you're supposed to be doing you're supposed to be preaching this word presenting a real living sacrifice a true atonement to the people so they can come in contact with that and it can live in them so we can get out of the way are you ready to get out of the way i'm ready to get out of the way let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word lord i think over and over what would we do if you haven't sent a prophet lord what kind of system will we be in what would we be believing lord we would still have a hunger in our heart to worship but how would we know the proper way to worship the proper place of worship how would we know where we are in redemption how would we know where to go and where to oh god if you hadn't come through that prophet we would be so lost we would be so blind so uncertain of what's going on but god you sent the eyes in this day through the prophet to open our eyes so that we could see where we're at so you could show us on the map of redemption where we are and what we're supposed to be doing god help us to be faithful in that calling help us lord to get out of the way oh god how we love you and thank you for your mercy and your kindness for your goodness and your grace lord i'm god was just a people lord just born in flesh but god inside is something you predestinated you foresaw and you knew would be here in this age and because of that you've opened our eyes you've given us i sav you've given us garments you've given us everything that we need you've worked your plan all the way to the end of the redemption of the gentiles and here we stand at the very end we stand at the precipice where we're as far as we can possibly go god let us be faithful in this position god we love you we thank you for open eyes help us to live this revelation help us to live in the reality of where we are gone may you get glory in our lives and may you use us to shine the light to others and accomplish your purpose and may you draw through the light that shines through each of us may you draw the last of your predestinated seed to this place so that we can get out of the way so that you can complete your work of redemption we thank you god we ask that you would do it now in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your friends blake well the sun is up now i can go free the chains that were holding me i can no longer see heard a long
