========================================

They say, "I don't know because I'm not an athlete." But they say that the roar of the crowd and the energy in the stadium can actually move the team. It can inspire them. Amen. It can get move them to greater feats. AMEN. LISTEN, WHY DON'T WE BECOME A TEAM? WHY DON'T we root for our team? WHY DON'T WE BECOME ENTHUSIASTIC? WHY DON'T WE CREATE A CHEER and an enthusiasm and an EXCITEMENT FOR WHOEVER'S RUNNING ON THE FIELD AND WHOEVER'S CATCHING THE BALL? WHY DON'T WE PICK UP THE INTENSITY A LITTLE BIT AND GET EXCITED ABOUT THE DAY THAT WE LIVE IN? LISTEN, WE'RE HERE TO MANIFEST ANOTHER SUPER SIGN. WHAT IS THE SUPER SIGN? JESUS in his day manifest the super SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION. DEATH HAS NO more hold on the children of God. He overcame death in himself. He said, "I have power to LAY MY LIFE DOWN. I HAVE THE POWER TO take it up." And when he took it up, he didn't take it UP FOR HIMSELF ONLY, BUT ALL THE SAINTS THAT HAD SLEPT in the Old Testament CAME WITH HIM. THAT WAS A SUPER SIGN. &gt;&gt; And listen, we're living in the hour OF ANOTHER SUPER SIGN. THERE'S going to be a resurrection of sleeping saints. Amen. The super sign is among us. IT'S TAKING PLACE. HE'S BRINGING IT TO PASS RIGHT NOW. ALMOST ANY MOMENT, ANY HOUR, ANY DAY. AMEN. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE saints arise. &gt;&gt; THAT WE SHOULD BE EXCITED ABOUT. WE SHOULD BE IN THE RHYTHM OF THE RESURRECTION. AMEN. LISTEN, THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ENTHUSIASTIC thing take place one of these days that's never happened before. Amen. There's going to be a people ON THIS EARTH THAT DON'T resurrect &gt;&gt; because they're not going to need a resurrection because they're GOING TO BE SO ONE WITH GOD THAT GOD IS GOING TO BE SO ALIVE IN THEIR FLESH THAT THEIR FLESH CANNOT DIE. BUT IT'LL CHANGE in a moment, IN THE TWINKLING of an eye. It'll become a brand new body. NO DEATH BUT LIFE. Let's get into the rhythm of the word. Let's get into the rhythm of the word, into the symphony that God's playing. Because we're living in the generation, friend, are you tired of SITTING ON THE SIDELINES WONDERING WHY EVERYBODY AROUND YOU IS EXCITED AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT? ARE YOU TIRED OF SITTING there saying, "All he's saying is confusion to me?" I'm telling YOU, GET INTO THE MESSAGE. READ, LISTEN, TALK ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN LIFE, &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AMEN. IF GOD'S NOT IN IT, IT'LL COME TO NOTHING. &gt;&gt; But if God anoints our day, if God ANOINTS OUR WORK, IF GOD ANOINTS OUR FAMILY, if God ANOINTS OUR HOBBY, THEN GOD IS MANIFESTING HIMSELF in us. &gt;&gt; This is the day we live in, friends. &gt;&gt; There's another super sign getting ready to manifest itself. The super sign of eternal life coming into flesh.
