[12:45] let's turn in our bibles to second
[12:46] corinthians chapter four
[12:51] i want to
[12:52] say that i very much enjoyed friday
[12:54] night it was really a wonderful time in
[12:57] the lord and wonderful time to be

[13:11] closer together as time continues on
[13:14] also thank you brother ron for the song
[13:16] this morning i can't hear that song
[13:18] without thinking of brother nestor amen
[13:20] i was just speaking with him i believe
[13:22] it was yesterday by whatsapp and i pray
[13:24] that god will just open the borders and
[13:26] make everything easy so he can come back
[13:28] and visit us how many would like to see
[13:30] brother nestor smile here at this pulpit
[13:33] again next year this coming year because
[13:35] when brother nestor smiles he's all
[13:37] smiling amen it warms my heart so we we
[13:40] hope that he can come
[13:42] i mean also i heard that sister deb
[13:44] johns is here sister john's back in the
[13:46] service
[13:47] amen god bless you sister deb it's good
[13:49] to see you again she's been really sick
[13:51] her and her husband with coven but god
[13:53] is faithful to his word amen it's good
[13:55] to see you in the service again
[13:57] amen let's look at this scripture here
[14:00] second corinthians chapter 4
[14:02] verse 3.
[14:06] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[14:09] them that are lost
[14:10] in whom the god of this world have
[14:12] blinded the minds of them which believe
[14:14] not lest the light of the glorious
[14:16] gospel of christ who is the image of god
[14:20] should shine unto them
[14:22] amen god bless you as you have your
[14:23] seats may the lord bless his word as we
[14:26] look into it tonight
[14:29] from out of this scripture i just want
[14:31] to focus mainly on the part that said
[14:33] the the gospel of christ who is the
[14:35] image of god
[14:37] so we know that christ is the image of
[14:39] god jesus christ was manifest on earth
[14:42] to reflect god to be the image of god
[14:45] and made flesh
[14:47] and we want to talk about that a little
[14:49] bit this this morning
[14:51] and as i've been preparing the service
[14:53] the lord's been dealing with me in a
[14:54] very specific direction and i i have a
[14:56] disclaimer before we start the service
[14:58] that there's nothing new amen there's
[15:00] we've been through all these quotes
[15:02] we've been through all these scriptures
[15:03] we've been talking and discussing these
[15:05] things for years but god just
[15:07] all of a sudden you know how it is
[15:09] there's a little greater clarity that
[15:11] comes all the time and things begin to
[15:13] just focus more and more and the picture
[15:15] you've been looking at all of a sudden
[15:17] comes into focus a little clearer and
[15:19] that's the way it is
[15:20] has been for me
[15:22] and there's a certain phrase that this
[15:24] title but i'm not going to give you the
[15:25] title now i'll give it to you in a
[15:26] minute and this title begins to focus my
[15:29] um
[15:30] uh my vision my revelation down a little
[15:33] bit
[15:34] and this came from a conversation i was
[15:36] having from brother jean he made a
[15:38] statement to me and it was about five or
[15:40] six weeks ago and i haven't been able to
[15:41] shake that statement and it just keeps
[15:43] working on me and working on me and it's
[15:46] the revelation of everything that we've
[15:47] been talking about and we'll get to that
[15:49] in a moment
[15:50] but tonight or not tonight this morning
[15:53] i'm going to read quite a few quotes
[15:55] because i want i want to read what the
[15:57] prophet said about these things so i'm
[15:59] going to read quite a few quotes but
[16:01] don't tune out or shut down on me say
[16:03] amen to the quote amen because the quote
[16:05] is preaching
[16:06] brother ben was preaching it we'll quote
[16:08] it like we're preaching it amen and you
[16:10] say amen just like it's being freshly
[16:12] preached because i am going to do quite
[16:14] a bit of reading so let's stay engaged
[16:15] through the reading because there's some
[16:17] magnificent things that the prophet says
[16:19] some wonderful things that this message
[16:21] has come to illuminate for us so that we
[16:23] understand where we are in the word
[16:25] where we are in the plan of god who we
[16:28] are in the plan of god and what is being
[16:30] manifest in this hour
[16:32] god has so worked his plan he does not
[16:35] want us confused about who we are
[16:38] where we are in time and what the
[16:40] manifestation of this hour is
[16:42] you know because if we don't listen to
[16:45] what the prophet has told us especially
[16:46] after the opening of the seals amen
[16:49] we'll be looking back or looking forward
[16:50] we'll be waiting for something amen and
[16:53] god does not want this bride waiting
[16:55] this is not the age of waiting this is
[16:56] the age of manifesting
[16:59] there is a word that has been laying
[17:02] in the thought of god and been hidden as
[17:04] a mystery through this bible amen for
[17:07] thousands and thousands of years it's
[17:09] been laying in the word and for
[17:12] more than years before years into
[17:14] eternity it was in the back part of
[17:15] god's mind and that thought which has
[17:18] become word is to be a manifested word
[17:20] today
[17:22] and so we have to catch that thought
[17:26] that word that is now to be made flesh
[17:28] and manifest in the day that we're
[17:30] living today because that is what god
[17:34] has ordained and called for in this day
[17:36] and if we're the people of the day of
[17:38] the manifestation of the day then we
[17:40] have to stop looking somewhere else for
[17:42] the word to be manifest or waiting
[17:44] somewhere or seeing it here seeing it
[17:46] there but we must come to the
[17:47] realization that the plan of god the
[17:50] word of god everything that god has done
[17:52] has come to this moment
[17:55] and we're a privileged people to be on
[17:57] this planet in this dimension at this
[17:59] moment
[18:00] and we don't want to miss that
[18:02] so
[18:03] as i'm reading
[18:05] amen just stay with me don't tune out
[18:07] stay engaged and i think we'll enjoy the
[18:10] word together
[18:14] i still have a little bit of a cough but
[18:16] i'm rebuking the devil every minute of
[18:18] the day
[18:19] i'm resisting the devil and he must flee
[18:21] so if i cough i hope it doesn't bother
[18:23] you but it surely does not bother me
[18:25] i've coughed so much in my life i'm used
[18:27] to it
[18:29] amen and the message works as faith
[18:31] expressed
[18:32] the prophet of god says the baptist
[18:33] minister told me not long ago i just
[18:35] can't accept revelation i said then you
[18:38] cannot accept the bible
[18:40] you cannot accept christ because he is
[18:42] the revelation of god
[18:45] he's god revealed in flesh
[18:49] therefore the whole church is built upon
[18:51] the divine revelation
[18:53] in the first seal the prophet says
[18:55] christ is the revelation of god so we
[18:57] want to lock that down christ is the
[18:59] revelation of god
[19:03] he came to reveal god because he and god
[19:05] were the same god was in christ
[19:07] reconciling the world to himself and
[19:10] otherwise you never know just what god
[19:13] was until he revealed himself through
[19:15] christ
[19:16] then you can see
[19:18] i want you to lock that statement down
[19:21] and i'm going to read it again but i
[19:22] want you to remember this statement out
[19:24] of the first seal and otherwise you
[19:26] never know just what god was until he
[19:29] revealed himself through christ
[19:32] then you can see
[19:34] so christ came to reveal god he came to
[19:39] manifest god he was god in flesh he was
[19:42] the revelation the manifestation of the
[19:44] invisible god now manifest in a body of
[19:47] flesh and a man named jesus christ
[19:51] and so and you never know just what god
[19:54] was until you revealed himself through
[19:56] christ
[19:57] then you can see i don't want you to
[20:00] forget that
[20:01] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[20:03] says now for a text i want to take out
[20:04] of there for a text basing it upon the
[20:07] entire bible but i want to use this
[20:09] i want us to title this christ is the
[20:12] mystery of god revealed christ being the
[20:16] mystery of god revealed so that's what
[20:19] brother branham's theme is when he
[20:20] begins to preach christ is the mystery
[20:23] god revealed he's telling you he's
[20:24] basing it on the entire bible
[20:27] but it's christ the mystery of god
[20:30] revealed there's been a mystery to god a
[20:32] mystery in his mind a mystery of how god
[20:35] will manifest himself reveal himself
[20:37] come tangible come flesh there's been a
[20:40] mystery to god but christ is the
[20:42] revelation of that mystery of god
[20:45] christ is the mystery of god revealed so
[20:48] if you want to see the mystery of god
[20:50] amen you you look to christ because
[20:53] christ is manifesting the mystery of god
[20:58] let's turn to the book of colossians
[21:00] together and read from chapter one
[21:11] colossians chapter one
[21:19] colossians 1
[21:20] and i'll begin with 12.
[21:24] we're going to read down to 18
[21:26] giving thanks unto the father which has
[21:28] made us meet to be partakers of the
[21:30] inheritance of the saints in light
[21:32] who hath delivered us from the
[21:34] who has delivered us from the power of
[21:36] darkness and hath translated us into the
[21:38] kingdom of his dear son
[21:40] in whom we have redemption through his
[21:42] blood even the forgiveness of sins
[21:44] who is the image of the invisible god
[21:47] the firstborn of every creature for by
[21:50] him were all things created that are in
[21:52] heaven that are in earth visible and
[21:54] invisible whether they be thrones or
[21:55] dominions or principalities or powers
[21:58] all things were created by him and for
[22:00] him and he is before all things and by
[22:02] him all things consist
[22:04] and he is the head of the body the
[22:06] church who is the beginning the
[22:08] firstborn from the dead that in all
[22:10] things he might have the preeminence
[22:13] so we see that verse 15 tells us that
[22:17] christ is the image of the invisible god
[22:21] and brother ben's going to reference
[22:23] this here in christ is the mystery of
[22:25] god revealed we're going down just a
[22:27] little further in christ as the mystery
[22:28] god revealed he says the first thing was
[22:30] that god wanted to reveal himself to the
[22:33] people
[22:34] you know no matter how much we desire
[22:37] that christ would come to save us from
[22:39] our sins god had a desire and coming as
[22:42] a son amen because he had a desire to
[22:45] reveal himself to the people
[22:47] so we when you think about what god has
[22:50] done in the plan of god and the plan of
[22:52] salvation and redemption and the
[22:53] manifestation of god and all the things
[22:55] we think about in this day you have to
[22:59] we we need to go back into the mind of
[23:01] god that's been revealed to us in this
[23:03] end time back before there was star
[23:05] molecule stardust before there was
[23:07] anything god was alone with his thoughts
[23:09] and god in his thoughts had a plan and
[23:12] that plan included you and i
[23:16] and and we know that we were our names
[23:18] were written in the lamb's book of life
[23:20] of the book of life of the lamb before
[23:22] the foundation of the world so that
[23:24] means you and i were included in the in
[23:26] the thought of god the plan of god that
[23:27] was sealed in the heavenlies before
[23:30] there was a foundation of the earth
[23:32] so
[23:33] so
[23:35] if i could say it this way
[23:37] no matter how much we want to love god
[23:39] we want to be redeemed we want to be
[23:41] saved god had to first want it before
[23:43] you would ever want it amen
[23:45] so which desire is greater your desire
[23:48] his desire his was the original desire
[23:51] so he had a desire unto you before you
[23:54] ever had a desire unto him
[23:57] amen and it shows we would never have a
[23:59] desire unto him if he didn't first have
[24:01] a desire unto us amen so all we're doing
[24:04] in this life is reflecting back a desire
[24:06] that god first had amen and his desire
[24:09] is the overriding desire that's moving
[24:12] everything into place so it's not it's
[24:14] not you know how much we love god it's
[24:17] how much god loves us
[24:20] this is grace that god loved us before
[24:23] before what before anything god loved us
[24:26] and chose us
[24:28] so all we're doing is just reflecting
[24:30] his choice his will and so from our
[24:32] perspective it feels like we're seeking
[24:35] after god and we're desiring god and we
[24:37] want so much to be saved and we want to
[24:39] be purified we want to be redeemed and
[24:42] we want to be one with him amen and
[24:44] that's such a strong desire to us but we
[24:46] have to realize that that desire
[24:49] originated in god first and that desire
[24:51] to for him towards us is is original to
[24:55] our desire towards him
[24:59] and if that's the truth how can we fail
[25:01] amen if that's the truth how could we
[25:03] not manifest what he desired before the
[25:05] foundation of the world when we realize
[25:07] that our greatest desire our longing all
[25:10] our loving all our need for him amen
[25:12] everything we desire is only reflecting
[25:15] back a desire he first had amen then you
[25:18] get so comfortable saying if i love him
[25:20] this much and want him this much amen he
[25:22] had to want me more and he had to want
[25:24] me first
[25:27] praise be to god this message listen i
[25:30] don't know how it's been preached in the
[25:32] past to people and what your experience
[25:34] has been but this message was not to
[25:36] bring condemnation this message was not
[25:38] to bring fear this message was never to
[25:40] put you on the fence but this message
[25:42] was always to take away fear anxiety
[25:45] doubt lies of the devil it was to take
[25:48] away denominational misunderstanding and
[25:50] it was to plant your feet on a solid
[25:52] ground that would be unmovable and
[25:54] unshakeable that you would have a
[25:56] confidence unfailing confidence and a
[25:58] god who had a plan before you ever
[26:00] showed up on this earth
[26:03] and this message maybe to you had been
[26:04] preached in a way that was condemning
[26:06] maybe to you it was preached in a way
[26:08] that caused fear like you wouldn't make
[26:10] the rapture if you weren't good enough
[26:11] or oh my goodness we were never good
[26:14] enough to make the rapture we'll never
[26:15] be good enough to make the rapture we
[26:17] already made the rapture
[26:20] that's the only way you'll make the
[26:21] rapture if you already made the rapture
[26:23] the only way you can be a son or
[26:25] daughter of god if you've always been a
[26:27] son and daughter of god this message
[26:29] came to take the fear away amen to take
[26:32] the control of man away it came to free
[26:36] a people to be what god has always
[26:39] ordained for us to be
[26:42] so all these truths in the message and
[26:44] the things that god has showed us out of
[26:46] his word and then it came to lift the
[26:49] bride up so that she could be what she's
[26:52] called to be in this day without this
[26:54] message we could never be what god has
[26:56] called for us to be in this day
[26:59] we had to have something that would take
[27:00] us above denominational thinking above
[27:03] the realms of humanity above this
[27:05] dimension and take us back to the mind
[27:07] of god so that we could peer into the
[27:09] thoughts of god from before the
[27:10] foundation of the world the part of his
[27:12] thinking that had been sealed
[27:15] and this day is unsealed
[27:18] and it came to establish us and build
[27:20] our faith how can you have rapturing
[27:22] faith without this message
[27:26] without the thunder sounding how would
[27:28] you ever have grace for a rapture
[27:31] how would you ever believe in a body
[27:33] change if you're still doubting who you
[27:35] are if you don't even know if you're
[27:37] saved how are you going to have faith
[27:38] for a change in the body
[27:43] but this message had to come to
[27:45] establish us and all those things to
[27:46] keep lifting us and lifting us and
[27:48] lifting to higher realms of faith all
[27:50] the time
[27:54] christ is the mystery of god revealed i
[27:56] told myself i'm not going to preach a
[27:57] bunch i'm just going to read quotes
[27:59] but i might do a little bit of both
[28:01] we'll see where we get amen
[28:05] god wanted to reveal himself to the
[28:07] people
[28:09] oh if that doesn't warm your heart
[28:10] nothing will
[28:13] god wants to reveal himself to you god
[28:17] wants you to see him
[28:19] he wants you to know him
[28:22] he wants you to fellowship with him
[28:26] he couldn't do it
[28:29] he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god
[28:32] who covered all space and time and
[28:33] eternity he could not he is too great to
[28:36] ever be revealed to people because it
[28:38] would be too mysterious
[28:40] how could that great being that never
[28:42] did begin that after you went beyond the
[28:44] cycle of hundreds of billions and
[28:46] trillions and trillions of years of life
[28:48] space
[28:49] and on out into the infinite into the
[28:51] eternity and a great creature that was
[28:54] all that and still is
[28:56] but what he wanted to do
[28:59] he loved fatherhood for he was a father
[29:02] and the only way that he could express
[29:04] it was to become a son of man
[29:07] i love this statement friends i love
[29:09] this statement because
[29:11] because once you realize a truth that
[29:13] the prophet is bringing us a true
[29:15] understanding of the nature of god you
[29:17] begin to understand so many more things
[29:19] amen
[29:21] he loved fatherhood
[29:23] because he was in himself a father
[29:27] so because he was a father he needed to
[29:30] express himself as a father but how
[29:32] could he express himself as a father
[29:34] unless he had a son
[29:37] amen
[29:38] in order to be the right kind of son to
[29:41] express the right kind of fatherhood
[29:43] amen he had to become a son of man and
[29:46] when he became a son of man he in that
[29:49] relationship could reflect back what a
[29:51] father was he was the father amen and he
[29:54] manifested and revealed that he was a
[29:56] father because he became a son of man
[29:58] and now when you see jesus christ on the
[30:00] earth jesus christ is not just
[30:03] manifesting the son he's also
[30:05] manifesting the father
[30:08] because in order to manifest the father
[30:10] you have to have a son and the son
[30:12] manifests the father
[30:14] right so god needed to play both parts
[30:19] so that he could reveal himself in
[30:21] fullness
[30:23] because if you don't understand if god
[30:25] doesn't reveal all of his
[30:26] characteristics all of his nature then
[30:29] what we have is a partial revelation of
[30:31] god not a full revelation of god and god
[30:33] wanted to reveal himself in fullness so
[30:35] he couldn't let fatherhood stay hidden
[30:37] he had to express it in order to express
[30:39] it he had to become a son of man amen so
[30:42] he could express himself as a son and
[30:45] express himself as a father
[30:49] all right that's wonderful
[30:51] but we know that he's also a husband
[30:56] and if he's going to express himself as
[30:58] a husband
[31:00] what expresses husband
[31:03] a wife
[31:05] you have to have a wife to express a
[31:07] husband just as you have to have a son
[31:09] to express a father
[31:11] so because god also amen was a husband
[31:16] he had to express himself as a wife amen
[31:20] so that he could have the right kind of
[31:22] expression because it takes the right
[31:23] kind of wife to express what a husband
[31:26] is
[31:29] amen
[31:31] so god still is playing both parts
[31:35] it's all him
[31:36] expressing himself revealing himself
[31:42] i'm going to read that sentence again
[31:44] and move on he loved fatherhood for he
[31:45] was a father and the only way that he
[31:47] could express it was to become a son of
[31:49] man
[31:50] that's the reason jesus kept saying the
[31:52] son of man see they didn't know what he
[31:54] was talking about many of them but now
[31:56] you get it see he wanted to express
[31:58] himself that was that was his one of his
[32:02] great threefold purposes was to express
[32:04] himself identify himself with human
[32:06] beings to reveal himself in christ
[32:11] secondly to have the preeminence in his
[32:13] body of believers that is his bride that
[32:15] he might live in people
[32:18] now he could listen carefully he could
[32:22] do that in adam and eve
[32:24] but sin separated
[32:27] so them
[32:27] an original plan he was going to bring
[32:30] forth his son and out of his son amen
[32:33] came a wife and he was bringing forth
[32:35] offspring upon the earth which he could
[32:38] have done this he could have manifested
[32:40] himself as husband and wife he could
[32:42] have manifest himself as son
[32:45] through his son through the sonship and
[32:46] fatherhood he could do this express
[32:49] himself through adam and eve amen but
[32:51] but as they begin to move on the earth
[32:54] sin began to separate them and now he
[32:56] could no longer manifest himself himself
[32:58] that way in their flesh
[33:02] so i read that again he could do that in
[33:04] adam and eve but sin separated them so
[33:06] there now there had to be some way to
[33:10] get it back again
[33:13] what's been his plan of redemption
[33:14] what's been the plan all through the
[33:16] bible to get that back again amen
[33:19] because what god does he does perfect
[33:22] amen everything he does is right and
[33:25] correct and perfect so when god first
[33:27] formed this earth we see in genesis
[33:30] beginning in genesis 1 2 when he was
[33:32] reforming the earth and he brought it to
[33:34] an eden and he put inside this eden his
[33:37] son and his son's wife to rule over it
[33:39] amen when he did that and he looked at
[33:42] all that he had made and all that he'd
[33:43] done and he said it is very good that
[33:46] was a picture of perfection and it was a
[33:49] picture of the perfect will of god
[33:52] and then that picture fell because of
[33:55] sin and separated god from the people so
[33:58] that he could not manifest himself in
[34:01] their flesh because sin separated but
[34:04] now he has to have a way to get that
[34:06] back because that picture was the
[34:07] correct picture
[34:10] that was not a wrong picture he didn't
[34:11] just do it in vain he just didn't do
[34:13] something and try it out when he fell he
[34:14] says now it didn't work i'll try
[34:16] something else no what he did was right
[34:18] and perfect amen and when it fell he had
[34:20] to work to bring it back to that because
[34:22] that was the original plan
[34:25] that's why brother ben says when i see
[34:27] this seventh seal it just he said i see
[34:29] the seven seal revealed all the way back
[34:31] in the beginning in genesis
[34:34] it was revealed all the way back amen
[34:36] and the way god revealed it is
[34:38] absolutely so beautiful that god upon
[34:41] this earth would bring forth a son and
[34:43] that son was adam amen and we would
[34:45] create adam and bring him into flesh and
[34:48] he was both male and female amen and god
[34:51] we know in the message masterpiece he
[34:53] was creating a masterpiece and he
[34:54] brought forth a masterpiece it was a son
[34:56] thou manifested in the flesh and he
[34:58] placed him in eden amen when god looked
[35:01] at this masterpiece he created he said
[35:03] it is not good
[35:06] that man should dwell alone
[35:08] the question is who made him that way
[35:11] who put him in the garden alone
[35:14] god did
[35:15] is god making mistake no he's not making
[35:17] a mistake he's revealing the back part
[35:19] of his mind
[35:21] when he says it's not good that man
[35:23] should be alone surely he knew that he
[35:25] made him alone and he put him in the
[35:26] garden alone but he already knew that
[35:29] there was something in adam that would
[35:32] meet the need that adam had he already
[35:34] knew the woman was in the man he put the
[35:37] woman in the man so he could bring the
[35:39] woman out of the man and back to the man
[35:41] amen because it was displaying what was
[35:43] in the back part of his mind
[35:46] this mystery of the seals and this
[35:48] mystery of the seventh seal has been
[35:50] laying wide open in our bibles for
[35:52] thousands of years amen but it was a
[35:54] mystery that was sealed until the seal
[35:57] came off and when the seal came off it
[35:59] unlocked our bible so that we could go
[36:01] back and see that this mystery that was
[36:04] in the back part of god's mind has been
[36:05] laying in plain sight
[36:07] for everybody to see
[36:09] and we've been stumbling over it for
[36:11] thousands of years
[36:14] so when he says it is not good god is
[36:16] not saying i made a mistake whoops i
[36:18] forgot something
[36:20] god doesn't forget anything
[36:22] what he's showing you is i'm not
[36:25] finished yet with my masterpiece
[36:29] when the artist is is working on a
[36:31] sculpture or a painting amen you know
[36:34] the artist isn't done because he comes
[36:36] back and he chisels some more if he
[36:38] chisels some more then the object he's
[36:40] making doesn't yet match the vision he
[36:42] has in his mind
[36:44] when he comes back to his drawing or his
[36:46] painting or a sculpture and he's putting
[36:48] more brush strokes and more color and
[36:49] more paint then you know assuredly that
[36:52] he's not finished
[36:54] and so when god was making in those six
[36:57] thousand years of creation when he come
[36:59] to make man and he said it's not good
[37:02] and he continues to work then you
[37:04] realize he has not yet finished the
[37:07] picture that he had in his mind
[37:09] the image of his masterpiece isn't done
[37:11] or else when the man was here he would
[37:14] have sealed it then and he would have
[37:15] went and taken his rest and he would
[37:16] have stopped his work that would have
[37:18] been it but that wasn't it that was not
[37:20] what he had in his mind he had more in
[37:23] his mind that had to be expressed and it
[37:25] was evident because the artist came back
[37:27] to the sculptor and kept chipping
[37:30] the painter came back and was adding
[37:32] brush strokes he's not done yet
[37:35] so then he took out of adam and laid him
[37:38] to sleep smote uh him in the side took
[37:40] out a rib amen and took this feminist
[37:43] spirit out of him and formed the woman
[37:45] and he formed the woman and woke up the
[37:47] man and united the two together and then
[37:49] when he looked
[37:51] and he seen all that he had made and all
[37:53] that was done he said behold
[37:55] it is very good
[37:58] and brother benham said then when he saw
[38:00] a son in his son's bride he turned over
[38:02] dominion the rulership of the of the
[38:05] creation to them and he went and took
[38:07] his rest
[38:08] that means the masterpiece is now done
[38:11] the artist is finished working
[38:15] so what is the picture of the bible that
[38:17] is the picture
[38:19] of the bible
[38:21] that's why we start so many times with
[38:23] that story because that story is the
[38:26] foreshadow of everything god would do
[38:29] from then on until he brings it back to
[38:31] that image
[38:36] i want to
[38:37] keep reading in this quote and i'll read
[38:39] this sentence over again
[38:41] now he could do that in adam and eve but
[38:44] sin separated them so now there had to
[38:47] be some way to get it back
[38:49] oh my
[38:51] this is rich to me just to even think of
[38:54] it see what god's purpose was
[38:57] what was he saying god's purpose was
[38:59] what he did in the garden
[39:01] that was his purpose now he's been
[39:02] working to bring it back to that and
[39:04] brother branham so rejoice he goes oh
[39:06] this is rich to me
[39:09] this is the prophet of god amen he's
[39:11] coming to preach christ is the mystery
[39:12] of god revealed which is going to be the
[39:13] revelation of the seventh seal something
[39:15] that he's known has been revealed to him
[39:17] that he hasn't went into great lengths
[39:18] to explain it to the people yet and now
[39:20] he's coming to explain what has been
[39:22] revealed to him and he's trying to show
[39:24] this great mystery under the seventh
[39:26] seal and he comes to adam and eve and he
[39:28] said oh this is so rich to me amen
[39:31] when i just think of it see what god's
[39:33] purpose was now why didn't he just keep
[39:36] adam and eve like that then he he would
[39:38] never be able to express his fullness
[39:42] his full attribute
[39:43] because he could have been a father
[39:45] there that's true but also he's a savior
[39:49] how do you know he was he is because
[39:50] i've had the experience see he is a
[39:52] savior and he had to express that and
[39:54] how could he do it only through christ
[39:57] how could he be a son only through
[39:58] christ how could he be a healer only
[40:00] through christ see all these things are
[40:02] wound up in that one person jesus christ
[40:05] oh my
[40:06] when i think of it i just see
[40:08] denominations pass off the scene and
[40:10] everything else just going see why i see
[40:13] god's great purpose revealing himself
[40:16] so what's god's great purpose revealing
[40:18] himself
[40:19] and having first to reveal himself in
[40:22] christ
[40:24] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[40:27] and then oh don't miss this statement
[40:29] hang with me
[40:31] i'm going to read it again
[40:33] i when i see the great purpose
[40:37] god's great purpose revealing himself
[40:39] and having first the first part of this
[40:41] great purpose to reveal himself in
[40:44] christ the fullness of the godhead
[40:45] bodily and then to bring that fullness
[40:49] of the godhead bodily into a people
[40:53] that he could have the preeminence the
[40:55] oversight the leading
[40:58] so when god wanted to express himself he
[40:59] first began to do that in jesus christ
[41:02] and jesus is jesus christ is the
[41:04] revelation of god
[41:06] he is the image of the invisible god
[41:10] but he wasn't done revealing himself yet
[41:14] he struck him in the side
[41:17] and he pulled out of him ingredients for
[41:19] a woman for a bride and he's been
[41:22] working for seven church ages to get
[41:24] this bride to the place that she's
[41:26] supposed to be because the masterpiece
[41:28] wasn't done yet
[41:31] the first part to reveal himself and
[41:33] reveal himself in christ
[41:34] fullness of the godhead bodily
[41:37] then to bring that fullness
[41:40] godhead bodily whatever was in christ to
[41:42] bring that fullness god had bodily into
[41:45] a people
[41:47] i want us to see that what god's doing
[41:49] now in his people
[41:50] it's not a secondary
[41:52] work or a second-rate work or a second
[41:55] class or an inferior way of revealing
[41:58] himself but that he brought first to
[42:00] reveal himself the fullness of the in
[42:02] christ the fullness of the godhead
[42:04] bodily that's how he revealed himself in
[42:06] christ and then to bring that fullness
[42:09] of the godhead bodily the revelation of
[42:11] christ into a people
[42:14] this is second class second rate this
[42:16] isn't a diminished work it's the same
[42:18] god continuing to manifest or reveal
[42:22] himself
[42:24] in the message the super sign the
[42:25] prophet says oh god if the world could
[42:28] only see that that god and man are one
[42:31] super sign was the first man that god
[42:33] could come into all that god was he
[42:35] poured into christ and all christ was he
[42:38] poured into the church
[42:40] super sign god and man together that was
[42:42] to be the super sign of the last day
[42:44] when the entire bible was to be
[42:46] fulfilled in the last days
[42:48] a super sign of virgin shall conceive
[42:50] and this conception when it's brought
[42:51] forth will be god manifested in the
[42:53] flesh a super sign they still don't
[42:56] believe it but it was anyhow it's still
[42:58] a super sign
[43:00] notice super sign they've got superman
[43:01] today they got fictions of superman all
[43:03] these other kind of super things but the
[43:05] church has got a super sign god back in
[43:09] the church manifested in human flesh god
[43:12] united with man his super his sure super
[43:15] sign notice the eternal sign on an
[43:18] unfailing sign it will never fail the
[43:20] word and man beca become one when god's
[43:23] word and man become one as saint john
[43:25] the first chapter says in the beginning
[43:27] was the word and the word was with god
[43:29] and the word was god and the word was
[43:31] made flesh and one among us that's the
[43:33] super sign
[43:34] oh if that was the super sign of that
[43:36] day
[43:38] when that same spirit that was in jesus
[43:40] christ comes into his church to manifest
[43:43] the written word for today that is still
[43:46] the super sign
[43:47] [Music]
[43:48] so you see what god's wanting to do all
[43:51] that he was he poured into christ
[43:53] all that christ was he poured into the
[43:55] church amen that bring the fullness of
[43:58] the godhead bodily and to bring that
[44:00] fullness of the godhead bodily into a
[44:02] people
[44:03] what's he doing he's restoring back what
[44:05] fell
[44:06] let's turn to colossians or we are we're
[44:08] in colossians i'm in colossians 1 are
[44:10] you in colossians 1
[44:12] all right let's go to verse 26.
[44:18] even the mystery which has been hid from
[44:20] ages and from generations but now is
[44:23] made manifest to a saints to whom god
[44:25] would make known what is the riches of
[44:27] the glory of this mystery among the
[44:28] gentiles which is christ in you
[44:32] the hope of glory
[44:35] i want you to remember who christ is
[44:38] christ is the image of the invisible god
[44:42] and now the revelation of this mystery
[44:44] among the gentiles is christ in you
[44:47] the hope of glory
[44:49] so that christ who was revealing and
[44:51] manifesting god is now the christ it is
[44:54] to come into you
[44:56] and what will he manifest then he will
[44:58] manifest god
[45:00] it won't be the same manifestation
[45:04] but it will be a manifestation of god
[45:07] it'll be the same thing
[45:09] in another form
[45:11] it'll be the same thing in another way
[45:13] in another expression the woman was a
[45:15] further expression of the man she wasn't
[45:18] different
[45:19] she wasn't something else she was adam
[45:23] we have to get this in our minds and
[45:25] understand that the woman was not
[45:27] something different than adam she was
[45:30] adam
[45:32] when he made them male and female and he
[45:34] called their name adam and the day that
[45:36] they were created they had one name one
[45:38] identity they were one flesh
[45:41] this is what this is what adam spoke
[45:43] when he prophesied when he saw the woman
[45:45] that a man shall leave his father and
[45:47] mother and cleveland to his wife and
[45:48] they too shall be one flesh when god
[45:51] when god made man and woman he called
[45:53] their name adam when god was going to
[45:56] make a woman he didn't do it like he did
[45:58] any other creature in creation amen he
[46:00] went back to the man because the woman
[46:02] was hiding in the man
[46:04] and when he pulled the woman out of the
[46:06] man she became a further expression of
[46:11] god
[46:14] is that right
[46:15] because god was expressing himself
[46:17] through a son and when that son now that
[46:20] son had another expression hidden inside
[46:22] of him and when that expression comes
[46:24] out into a manifestation and now it's a
[46:26] further expression of what was in the
[46:28] man and what was in the man the
[46:30] expression of god was in the man and
[46:32] there was another expression in the man
[46:34] of a woman
[46:36] so it's still god expressing himself
[46:41] so when the same spirit that was on
[46:42] jesus christ comes into his church
[46:45] to manifest the written word for today
[46:47] that is still the super sign
[46:52] how many is looking for a sign
[46:55] the sign is here
[46:57] it's christ and his bride
[46:59] the fullness of the word that has been
[47:00] restored to a bride the headship that
[47:02] has been connected to the body that is
[47:04] the super sign friends
[47:08] let's turn to john 14.
[47:20] john 14
[47:23] 23
[47:29] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[47:31] man loved me he will keep my words and
[47:34] my father will love him and we will come
[47:36] into him and make our abode with him
[47:42] my
[47:44] all that god was
[47:46] he poured into christ
[47:49] all that christ was
[47:50] he poured into the church
[47:55] all that god was he poured into christ
[47:59] so the fullness of the godhead was
[48:01] bodily in christ
[48:04] now all that christ is where did god go
[48:06] to believe
[48:09] all that christ is
[48:11] he pours into the church
[48:17] and he says
[48:19] if a man love me he will keep my words
[48:21] and my father will love him and we
[48:25] will come unto him
[48:27] and make our abode with him
[48:32] that's
[48:32] fullness
[48:36] and the message christ is the mystery of
[48:37] god revealed again he said god expressed
[48:39] in jesus christ who was both father son
[48:42] and holy ghost the fullness of the
[48:44] godhead bodily
[48:46] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[48:48] bodily dwells in his church
[48:51] the preeminence is all that god was he
[48:54] poured into christ all that christ was
[48:56] he poured into the church
[48:58] the believers
[49:00] praise god
[49:03] in the message
[49:05] the unveiling of god
[49:08] now when it said there here that he
[49:09] emptied himself or poured out now we
[49:12] would think like this that he vomited up
[49:14] the english word of emptied or poured
[49:16] out from him seeing something went out
[49:18] of him that was different from him but
[49:20] the word kinos in the greek does not
[49:22] mean that he vomited up or his arm went
[49:24] off or his eye went out another person
[49:27] that is he changed himself he poured
[49:29] himself into
[49:31] into another mask into another form not
[49:33] another person went out of him called
[49:35] the holy spirit but it was he himself
[49:37] you get it he himself poured himself
[49:40] into the people christ in you
[49:43] how beautiful how wonderful to think god
[49:45] pouring himself into the human being
[49:47] into the believer pouring out it was
[49:50] part of his drama to do so
[49:52] god all the fullness all the godhead
[49:54] bodily was in the person jesus christ he
[49:57] was god and god alone not a third person
[49:59] or a second person or a first person but
[50:02] the person god veiled in human flesh
[50:05] so the prophet saying when he poured out
[50:07] it wasn't as if god's here and he poured
[50:10] something out and out of him came
[50:11] something else and that is now something
[50:13] different but what he did is he poured
[50:15] himself into another form
[50:19] and jesus christ was the image of the
[50:21] invisible god because god poured himself
[50:24] into
[50:24] christ
[50:26] and then christ now what has christ done
[50:29] now christ has poured himself into the
[50:32] body of believers
[50:35] not
[50:35] poured something out
[50:38] but poured himself into
[50:42] i hope this starts clicking like it's
[50:44] never clicked before
[50:46] i hope it becomes more of a reality
[50:48] because we we understand by dimensions
[50:51] we understand by space matter time we we
[50:54] have these things these physics these
[50:57] physical properties that we understand
[50:59] things by we judge by distances we judge
[51:01] by by physical appearances amen and so
[51:04] we get so fixed in our mind that that
[51:07] when when the woman came out of adam we
[51:10] know we know in our minds that they are
[51:12] one flesh but we can't help ourselves
[51:14] from seeing two
[51:16] we see two we think two we think double
[51:20] we think in plural amen but when god
[51:22] made that creation god did not think in
[51:24] plural god did not see double god saw
[51:27] one he called it one he meant for it to
[51:29] be one to god it was always one amen to
[51:32] us in our finite minds we have such a
[51:34] hard time breaking ourselves from the
[51:37] physical world and you can see a man and
[51:39] you can see a woman and you can hardly
[51:40] stop from seeing two
[51:44] but god is not bound amen by the
[51:46] physical world when god looks down and
[51:48] sees what he made he sees one amen they
[51:51] were always one they were always
[51:53] destined to be one they started off as
[51:55] one they are still joined as one god saw
[51:59] one
[52:00] amen
[52:02] and so we have to understand that when
[52:05] god pours himself into another image you
[52:08] could say now now there's two now
[52:10] there's three now there's this and now
[52:12] there's that it's all god friends it's
[52:14] god in different ways of expressing
[52:16] himself in different manifestations amen
[52:19] in different administrations different
[52:21] ways of pouring himself into an image
[52:23] pouring himself into a manifestation
[52:25] it's still gone god in the word is the
[52:27] same
[52:29] so is this the word of god
[52:31] yes so i'm holding the written form of
[52:33] the word of god so dude i have all of
[52:36] god in my arms and my package and you
[52:37] have none
[52:41] we think so physical
[52:44] we think we have to have a spiritual
[52:46] mind to understand spiritual things
[52:51] god was before physics god created
[52:54] physics
[52:56] so he exists outside of physics
[52:59] and he exists within physics because he
[53:01] created physics
[53:02] he exists outside of gravity and he
[53:04] exists within gravity because he created
[53:06] it so he encompasses outside and inside
[53:09] he he he is manifest outside of time he
[53:11] dwells outside of time he dwells inside
[53:13] a time because he manifested he
[53:15] manufactured time
[53:17] he invented time he created time amen so
[53:20] he dwells in and out of time
[53:23] so is god in time yes is he out of time
[53:25] yes
[53:27] god created the unseen world god created
[53:29] the scene world is he in the same world
[53:31] yes is he in the unseen world yes which
[53:33] world is he in he's in both
[53:37] oh god help us to stop thinking like
[53:39] human beings and start thinking like god
[53:42] amen
[53:45] amen
[53:46] where am i
[53:48] praise god let's go to ephesians chapter
[53:51] 2.
[53:54] there's so many things in the bible
[53:56] we'll never understand if we stay locked
[53:58] into physical understanding
[54:00] they will never make sense we will
[54:02] always get them out of place and out of
[54:04] kilter if we don't think spiritually
[54:10] ephesians chapter 2 the apostle paul
[54:12] saying beginning in verse 19 now
[54:14] therefore you are no more strangers and
[54:16] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[54:17] saints and of the household of god
[54:20] and are built upon the foundation of the
[54:21] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[54:23] himself being the chief cornerstone
[54:26] in whom all
[54:27] the building fitly framed together
[54:29] groweth unto a holy temple in the lord
[54:32] in whom ye also are builded together for
[54:34] a habitation of god through the spirit
[54:39] this temple that's being built of these
[54:41] living stones
[54:43] these individual stones that god has
[54:46] ordained and shaped and brought to this
[54:48] temple he's been building it over seven
[54:50] church ages
[54:52] and this
[54:54] building this temple
[54:56] is to be built together
[54:58] to be a
[54:59] habitation of god where will god dwell
[55:03] he'll pour himself into this habitation
[55:07] this dwelling place this place where god
[55:10] will dwell
[55:12] in the temple
[55:13] what temple the temple of his bride
[55:20] in christ as the mystery of god revealed
[55:22] he says now peter
[55:24] when he called he said thou are christ
[55:25] the son of the living god now watch
[55:27] blessed art thou simon barjona
[55:30] says which means son of jonah blessed
[55:32] art thou for the flesh and blood never
[55:33] revealed this to you you never learned
[55:35] it from some school but my father which
[55:37] is in heaven has revealed it to you
[55:39] notice what he said to him upon this
[55:41] rock that's peter the predestinated seed
[55:44] of god that had received this light
[55:46] and given the keys to the kingdom upon
[55:49] this rock of revelation of who jesus
[55:52] christ is he is the full manifested god
[55:56] upon this rock not a father son holy
[55:59] ghost and him being the second person
[56:01] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[56:04] the gates of hell will never shake it
[56:06] down never prevail against him i'll
[56:08] build my church upon this rock a
[56:10] revelation of jesus christ
[56:12] look christ in you
[56:14] makes him the center of life of the
[56:16] revelation
[56:18] christ's life in you makes him the
[56:20] center of the revelation
[56:24] christ in the bible makes the bible the
[56:26] complete revelation of christ
[56:30] in you
[56:31] makes you the complete revelation of the
[56:34] whole thing
[56:36] see what god is trying to do
[56:39] what's he trying to do restore back what
[56:41] fell in eden
[56:44] what a statement friends
[56:47] i pray god will help us to understand
[56:48] that
[56:50] i pray that god will give us
[56:51] supernatural revelation because it's the
[56:52] only way we're going to understand what
[56:54] the prophet is saying
[56:56] christ in you makes you the complete
[56:58] revelation of the whole thing
[57:02] my
[57:03] do you believe he meant what he said
[57:06] i confess i don't understand it like i
[57:08] ought to but i pray god will help me
[57:10] understand this like i ought to
[57:13] in the ephesians church age from the
[57:15] church age book he says this
[57:17] seven golden candlesticks in exodus 25
[57:20] 31 it says and you shall make a candle
[57:22] stick of pure gold of beaten work shall
[57:24] the candlestick be made
[57:26] his shaft and his branches his bowls his
[57:28] knobs his flowers shall be of the same
[57:31] then brother goes on to say the true
[57:32] church of jesus christ the bride is
[57:35] likened to pure gold
[57:37] now gold is a type of
[57:38] deity her righteousness is his
[57:41] righteousness her attributes are his own
[57:43] glorious attributes her identity is
[57:46] found in him what he is she is to
[57:48] reflect
[57:49] what he has she is to manifest
[57:52] there is no fault in her she is all
[57:55] glorious within and without from
[57:57] beginning to ending she is the work of
[57:59] her lord and all his works are perfect
[58:02] can you say that
[58:04] all his works are perfect are you his
[58:06] work are you his workmanship created in
[58:09] christ he's in the good works then god
[58:10] is doing a perfect work
[58:13] you can say my flesh i can see failure i
[58:16] can see fault but god is looking at the
[58:18] word amen god is looking at who you
[58:20] really are and he's moving you into that
[58:22] manifestation and his work that he's
[58:24] doing in his bride is perfect she is
[58:27] perfect because she is his workmanship
[58:31] it's him working amen it's not us
[58:33] working it's him working so so in the
[58:36] beginning to the end she is the work of
[58:37] her lord and all his works are perfect
[58:39] listen to what he says here
[58:41] in fact in her
[58:44] is summed up and manifested the entire
[58:47] wisdom and purpose of
[58:48] god this is what the prophet of god says
[58:51] so before in in in the message that we
[58:54] were just reading
[58:55] in christ as the mystery of god revealed
[58:57] he says christ in you makes you the
[59:00] complete revelation of the whole
[59:02] thing see what god is trying to do
[59:05] and now in the church age book in the
[59:07] ephesians church age he said in fact in
[59:09] her is summed up and manifested the
[59:13] entire wisdom and purpose of god
[59:19] how can one fathom it
[59:21] how can one understand it though we
[59:23] cannot do that we can accept it by faith
[59:25] for god has spoken it
[59:28] god when he when he went to work in the
[59:31] masterpiece to restore back amen until
[59:33] god amen in the in the original
[59:36] masterpiece until god had brought forth
[59:38] the woman and brought the woman into
[59:40] manifestation and united her with her
[59:42] husband he could not rest from his works
[59:45] and go into his rest amen he had to
[59:47] finish the masterpiece before he could
[59:50] rest so the the the culmination or the
[59:53] capping or the finishing of the
[59:54] masterpiece was bringing forth the women
[59:57] woman and uniting her to her husband
[1:00:00] then after he finished that that was the
[1:00:02] period at the end of his work and he
[1:00:03] could take his rest
[1:00:05] so now
[1:00:06] god's work that he's rebuilding this
[1:00:09] masterpiece and bringing it back cannot
[1:00:11] stop cannot finish till he brings forth
[1:00:14] the woman once again and manifests the
[1:00:16] woman and unites her again with her
[1:00:18] headship with her husband then when he
[1:00:21] does that amen now he's coming to the
[1:00:23] completion of his work that's why
[1:00:25] brother branham said in her in this
[1:00:28] manifestation of a bride in the end time
[1:00:30] in her is the in fact in her is summed
[1:00:33] up and manifested the entire wisdom and
[1:00:36] purpose of god
[1:00:40] my what a statement that's why i love
[1:00:42] brother bram says who can fathom it
[1:00:45] how can we understand it
[1:00:48] we cannot do that
[1:00:50] but we accept it by faith for god has
[1:00:52] spoken
[1:00:55] you know
[1:00:56] sometimes
[1:00:58] people can start
[1:00:59] getting the impression or the
[1:01:00] understanding that we talk too much
[1:01:03] about the bride
[1:01:06] but
[1:01:07] if you have the proper understanding of
[1:01:09] revelation you're not talking about
[1:01:12] human beings in human flesh you're
[1:01:14] talking about a manifestation of jesus
[1:01:16] christ
[1:01:18] and the manifestation of jesus christ
[1:01:20] for today
[1:01:22] what god is doing today
[1:01:24] where god is at today where god is
[1:01:27] revealing himself today amen it's not
[1:01:30] talking about a person or a people and
[1:01:32] lifting up a bunch of human flesh and
[1:01:34] lumps of clay that's not what preaching
[1:01:36] on the bride is to do it's not to bring
[1:01:38] an arrogance it's not to bring a pride
[1:01:40] it's not to inflate human being amen
[1:01:43] it's to recognize the word for our day
[1:01:45] to recognize where jesus christ is
[1:01:48] manifest today what part of the book is
[1:01:50] being manifest what part of the word is
[1:01:52] coming into realization amen and it's
[1:01:55] christ it's jesus christ manifesting
[1:01:57] himself in his body his people
[1:02:00] that is the word for our day that is the
[1:02:03] revelation of this day that is the
[1:02:05] manifestation of christ today
[1:02:10] that's why christ in you
[1:02:12] makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:02:13] whole thing
[1:02:15] because what is christ in you in the end
[1:02:17] time
[1:02:18] it is god taking
[1:02:21] the man
[1:02:22] and the woman
[1:02:24] and putting them back together as one
[1:02:27] how can that not be the complete
[1:02:29] revelation of the whole thing
[1:02:32] it is the revelation of the whole thing
[1:02:36] it is his purpose
[1:02:37] and that's why brother man said in fact
[1:02:39] in her summed up and manifest the
[1:02:42] the eternal wisdom and purpose of god
[1:02:46] to manifest himself
[1:02:49] to make man in the image of god he made
[1:02:51] him male and female
[1:02:54] god manifesting himself
[1:02:58] let's turn to john 14.
[1:03:15] john 14 18
[1:03:18] i will not leave you comfortless
[1:03:20] i will come to you
[1:03:23] yet a little while in the world seeth me
[1:03:25] no more but ye see me because i live you
[1:03:28] shall live also
[1:03:29] at that day you shall know that i am in
[1:03:31] my father and ye and me
[1:03:33] and i
[1:03:35] in you
[1:03:36] there's coming a day that you're going
[1:03:38] to realize that he's the father
[1:03:43] and we're in him
[1:03:45] and he's in us
[1:03:48] if he's in the father
[1:03:51] and we're in him
[1:03:53] and he's in us
[1:03:56] where's the father
[1:03:58] where's the godhead
[1:04:00] where's the fullness of the godhead
[1:04:03] he said
[1:04:04] at that day
[1:04:06] you shall know
[1:04:07] that i
[1:04:09] am in the father
[1:04:10] so christ is in the father
[1:04:14] then you're in christ
[1:04:18] and christ who's in the father
[1:04:20] is now in you
[1:04:23] praise be to god
[1:04:25] are you secure
[1:04:27] are you safe
[1:04:28] are you in the plan of god
[1:04:30] are you in jeopardy of being lost
[1:04:33] are you in jeopardy of not making it are
[1:04:35] you in jeopardy of not being a son of
[1:04:37] god is are you on the fence are you are
[1:04:39] you
[1:04:40] one step away from total ruin and and
[1:04:43] going to hell
[1:04:45] not if you're a son of god born again by
[1:04:46] the spirit of god you're not
[1:04:50] and the message of christ is the mystery
[1:04:51] of god
[1:04:52] revealed he says now notice
[1:04:55] god making himself known not we're not
[1:04:57] supposed to make converse to
[1:04:58] christianity by our government but by
[1:05:00] the revelation the christ in you
[1:05:05] how we make conference to christ by
[1:05:08] christ being in you
[1:05:10] and you being a living epistle
[1:05:12] and them seeing christ in you
[1:05:15] we do not make congress to christianity
[1:05:16] by government but by the revelation the
[1:05:18] christ in you as god was in christ
[1:05:20] as god was in christ christ in you
[1:05:23] so as god was in christ christ is in you
[1:05:26] so as much as god was in christ christ
[1:05:28] is in you
[1:05:30] as much as they had that relationship of
[1:05:32] oneness christ and you have the
[1:05:34] relationship of oneness
[1:05:37] now christ and you as god was in crisis
[1:05:39] god was in christ christ in you
[1:05:41] when what god did in christ christ does
[1:05:43] in you what signs did god in christ
[1:05:45] christ does in you oh isn't that
[1:05:47] beautiful oh my i like that jesus said
[1:05:49] at that day that's this day so brother
[1:05:52] graham's taking this scripture and he's
[1:05:53] applying it for you that's this day
[1:05:56] she said at that day that's this day at
[1:05:58] that day when this revelation is made
[1:06:00] known you will know that i am in the
[1:06:02] father and the father and me i in you
[1:06:04] and you and me
[1:06:06] when the revelation is made manifest at
[1:06:08] that day you shall know that i and the
[1:06:11] father are one i am in the father and
[1:06:14] the father and me
[1:06:16] then when the revelation comes forth
[1:06:17] then it's i in you and you and me there
[1:06:20] you are
[1:06:22] how far away is christ
[1:06:25] where is he at
[1:06:27] praise god
[1:06:29] let's go to ephesians chapter one
[1:06:39] i said none of these things are new
[1:06:40] we've read these things we've talked
[1:06:42] about these things
[1:06:43] but they become so
[1:06:45] real and they ought to be becoming so
[1:06:47] much more real and relevant day by day
[1:06:52] ephesians chapter 1 verse 2
[1:06:56] it says
[1:06:57] and hath put all things under his feet
[1:07:00] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:07:01] things to the church
[1:07:03] which is his body
[1:07:05] the fullness of him
[1:07:07] that filleth all in all
[1:07:10] so what is his body
[1:07:12] his body is the fullness of him that
[1:07:14] filleth all in all
[1:07:17] let's read that again he hath put all
[1:07:18] things under his feet and give him to be
[1:07:20] the head over all things to the church
[1:07:23] which is his body so what is the church
[1:07:25] it is his body
[1:07:27] so where do you live in your body
[1:07:30] where do you live
[1:07:31] in your body
[1:07:33] so the church which is his body
[1:07:37] the fullness of him
[1:07:39] that filleth all in all christ will be
[1:07:42] expressed in fullness in his body
[1:07:46] because she
[1:07:47] is
[1:07:48] him
[1:07:49] is that what the prophet told us
[1:07:52] and the message christ is revealed in
[1:07:54] his own word he says see down through
[1:07:56] the age
[1:07:57] we start off from the foundation from
[1:07:59] the first church age when the seed went
[1:08:01] into the ground the complete seed then
[1:08:03] it come out through the feet luther come
[1:08:05] back out through wesley then to
[1:08:07] pentecostals the tongues and the lips
[1:08:08] see now it's in the eyes prophetic of
[1:08:11] malachi 4 and so forth and now there's
[1:08:13] nothing else left for it to come but him
[1:08:16] himself to step into that because that's
[1:08:19] the last thing there is
[1:08:21] he's talking about the church ages that
[1:08:23] body of the bride has been built up from
[1:08:25] the feet of luther through wesley amen
[1:08:27] and and then he says on up into the
[1:08:30] prophetic of malachi 4.
[1:08:33] and so forth and now there is nothing
[1:08:36] else left for it to come
[1:08:38] but for him himself to step into that
[1:08:42] so after the mystery of malachi 4
[1:08:44] there's nothing left there's only one
[1:08:46] thing it's for jesus christ himself in
[1:08:48] fullness to step into that
[1:08:51] so that the body will be the fullness of
[1:08:52] him that filleth all in all
[1:08:57] so now there's nothing else left for it
[1:08:58] become to come but for him himself to
[1:09:01] step into that because that's the last
[1:09:03] thing there is
[1:09:04] the next is the intelligence and we have
[1:09:06] no intelligence of our own it's his we
[1:09:08] have no side of our own how can a man
[1:09:10] foresee those things he can't do it it's
[1:09:13] god himself it's becoming to a place and
[1:09:15] he's governing the body all the way
[1:09:17] through
[1:09:18] then the complete body of christ is
[1:09:20] revealed in the form of a bride
[1:09:24] the complete body of christ
[1:09:27] is revealed
[1:09:28] in the form of a bride
[1:09:30] that was taken out of his side like adam
[1:09:33] did at the beginning
[1:09:34] like adam was rather at the beginning
[1:09:37] the complete body of christ
[1:09:39] is revealed in the form of a bride
[1:09:45] brother bram said in choosing of a bride
[1:09:47] he said the other is impregnated by the
[1:09:48] word of god and will bring forth the
[1:09:50] body the finished body of jesus christ
[1:09:53] which is the bride
[1:09:55] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[1:09:56] how many knows that a man and a woman is
[1:09:59] one and christ is one body the word
[1:10:03] so now we have to be careful when when
[1:10:06] we look at what brother branham is
[1:10:07] telling us that we don't fall back into
[1:10:09] natural ways of viewing things in the
[1:10:11] natural world because just as much as
[1:10:14] you cannot look at adam and his bride
[1:10:16] and call them two you can only with the
[1:10:19] revelation of god call them one
[1:10:23] now he's saying
[1:10:25] now brother branham is saying and christ
[1:10:28] is one body the word
[1:10:30] now you can't say
[1:10:32] christ one body in the church one body
[1:10:35] and now we have two bodies
[1:10:39] amen your human mind will see double
[1:10:42] your human mind will see a
[1:10:45] plurality amen but the mind of god does
[1:10:48] not see plurality the mind of god sees
[1:10:50] one
[1:10:52] because when christ when jesus christ
[1:10:54] was hear flesh when the word was made
[1:10:57] flesh and dwelt among us where were you
[1:11:00] what did the prophet tell you when the
[1:11:02] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:11:04] where were you amen you were in that
[1:11:07] body because you're part of that word
[1:11:10] so it was one body when jesus christ was
[1:11:13] here on earth you were in that body
[1:11:15] brother brenham said that we don't have
[1:11:17] to go to calvary and pray for our sins
[1:11:18] we've already paid for our sins on
[1:11:20] calvary because you were on calvary
[1:11:24] you were part of that body because that
[1:11:25] was the full measure of the word
[1:11:27] manifest into a body of flesh and if
[1:11:30] you're part of the word you had to be
[1:11:32] part of that manifestation part of that
[1:11:34] body amen so it was singular not plural
[1:11:41] from out of that body he takes part of
[1:11:44] that word
[1:11:47] not different word
[1:11:50] not not
[1:11:51] another thought the same thought amen
[1:11:54] when god brought forth his son upon the
[1:11:56] earth the woman was not a second thought
[1:11:59] she was not an afterthought she wasn't a
[1:12:02] secondary thought she was part of the
[1:12:04] original thought of god
[1:12:07] and when god laid adam down to pull the
[1:12:09] woman out of him he was expressing adam
[1:12:12] he was not expressing something else he
[1:12:14] was expressing adam he was not
[1:12:16] expressing eve because she did not get a
[1:12:18] name till she separated from her husband
[1:12:20] in adultery and her name is a name of
[1:12:22] adultery she didn't need a name she
[1:12:24] didn't need an identity she got another
[1:12:26] identity when she took another word
[1:12:30] but she was not supposed to have another
[1:12:32] identity she was not supposed to have
[1:12:34] another identification she was not
[1:12:36] supposed to have another name her name
[1:12:38] was adam she was part of adam she was a
[1:12:41] revelation and a manifestation of adam
[1:12:45] not another the same
[1:12:49] not adam part two adam
[1:12:52] singular adam
[1:12:54] adam male adam female adam won and
[1:12:58] christ in his body is one and you were
[1:13:00] one there on calvary and you're one here
[1:13:03] now
[1:13:04] in this world because christ has come
[1:13:06] down amen to manifest himself in his
[1:13:09] bride and it's one body manifesting the
[1:13:12] the life of jesus christ
[1:13:15] now god doesn't see plural
[1:13:18] god is looking singular
[1:13:28] i'll give you my title now
[1:13:32] i go back to remember i wrote it
[1:13:36] the bride
[1:13:37] is the manifestation of christ
[1:13:41] now that's simple
[1:13:43] we've known that
[1:13:45] but have we been saying that
[1:13:48] the bride is the manifestation of christ
[1:13:50] just as christ was the manifestation of
[1:13:52] god
[1:13:54] just as christ was the manifestation of
[1:13:56] god in this day the bride is the
[1:13:59] manifestation
[1:14:00] of christ
[1:14:03] i'm going to read some quotes to
[1:14:05] solidify that
[1:14:06] so you don't have to feel uncomfortable
[1:14:10] i'm reading out choosing my bride i'll
[1:14:12] continue to read this quote the other is
[1:14:14] pregnant by the word of god and will
[1:14:15] bring forth the body the finished body
[1:14:17] of jesus christ which is the bride
[1:14:20] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[1:14:25] listen
[1:14:26] this is so beautiful
[1:14:29] when you saw in the in the pictures and
[1:14:32] the pictures of our mind we see a body
[1:14:35] on calvary and that body was the
[1:14:38] fullness of the word manufactured it was
[1:14:39] everything it was a complete body
[1:14:42] but in the mind of god the body's not
[1:14:44] complete yet because it's going to take
[1:14:46] from this body to finish making the body
[1:14:51] not another body to finish this body
[1:14:54] that's what brother was telling us the
[1:14:56] body of christ isn't finished yet how
[1:14:58] many knows that a man
[1:15:00] a man and a woman is one
[1:15:03] and christ is one body the word the
[1:15:06] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:15:08] body and the two together makes the one
[1:15:11] body again
[1:15:13] you got that are you thinking plural or
[1:15:15] singular now
[1:15:17] amen christ is one body the word the
[1:15:19] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:15:22] body because that body is the word made
[1:15:25] flesh the bride is the word made flesh
[1:15:27] it's the same body
[1:15:30] don't think physical amen don't don't
[1:15:33] think plural don't go back to human
[1:15:35] thinking don't see a picture of one and
[1:15:37] then a picture of another think like god
[1:15:39] god is saying this came out of that and
[1:15:41] as a continuation of that this is the
[1:15:43] same body the body is expanding in
[1:15:45] manifestation
[1:15:47] when god laid adam down and took out of
[1:15:50] adam the ingredients to form the woman
[1:15:52] it wasn't a new body a many took from
[1:15:54] that body to expand the revelation of
[1:15:57] that body
[1:15:59] she was adam expanded
[1:16:03] she was the body of adam expanded
[1:16:07] manifested more fully more more vivid
[1:16:10] and more color with more brush strokes
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:14] and now the bride is part of that body
[1:16:16] and she is the finishing of that body
[1:16:21] the bride will have to be the rest of
[1:16:24] the body
[1:16:25] and the two together makes the one body
[1:16:29] again what body the body of the word
[1:16:33] made flesh
[1:16:39] like adam was at the beginning man his
[1:16:41] wife are one
[1:16:42] she the true bride so sold out to him
[1:16:45] that she uses no mind of her own his
[1:16:48] mind of course is his will and his will
[1:16:51] is his word
[1:16:53] let's look at ephesians chapter five
[1:17:00] ephesians chapter 5
[1:17:02] i'm going to read from verse 29
[1:17:06] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:17:09] but nourishes it and cherishes it even
[1:17:11] as the lord the church
[1:17:14] so the church is his own flesh
[1:17:17] not different flesh his own flesh
[1:17:20] is that right
[1:17:22] listen to what he says
[1:17:24] for we are members of his body of his
[1:17:27] flesh and of his bones
[1:17:31] are we part of the body of christ
[1:17:34] is this a continuation of his body this
[1:17:36] body has to come to a completion the
[1:17:38] completion of the body of christ
[1:17:40] and it has to come to a completion in
[1:17:42] this day
[1:17:43] let's look at first corinthians chapter
[1:17:45] 12.
[1:17:50] and verse 27.
[1:17:55] paul says
[1:17:57] now ye are the body of christ
[1:18:00] and members in particular
[1:18:03] see what brother branham is teaching us
[1:18:05] is nothing different than what paul the
[1:18:06] apostle taught us
[1:18:08] only the church stopped taking paul
[1:18:10] literally
[1:18:12] the church stopped believing what paul
[1:18:14] said
[1:18:16] and they started making it
[1:18:18] a mysterious somehow they started making
[1:18:20] it uh
[1:18:21] only spiritual you know nothing in this
[1:18:23] physical form they they they just
[1:18:26] started reading words with no meaning
[1:18:29] because they explained away all the
[1:18:30] meaning but what brother branham did is
[1:18:32] he brought us right back to what paul
[1:18:33] said and paul says he says paul meant
[1:18:35] what he wrote
[1:18:36] right that you are the body of christ
[1:18:39] and paul told us you are part of his
[1:18:41] flesh and of his bones
[1:18:44] a further expression of christ
[1:18:48] brother brahm says in the invisible
[1:18:50] union of the bride of christ but you
[1:18:53] remember when it went down the grain
[1:18:55] began to ripen that you find before that
[1:18:57] grain can ripen
[1:18:59] everything in that stalk has to be dead
[1:19:02] hallelujah can't you see where we're
[1:19:04] standing life is in the grain again what
[1:19:06] is it what is it just exactly like the
[1:19:08] same grain that went in the ground
[1:19:10] the same jesus in the bride form
[1:19:13] same power same church same thing same
[1:19:16] word the same word sucked up through
[1:19:18] these and come out here and come to a
[1:19:20] head here and all that life that come
[1:19:22] through here picked up its people now
[1:19:24] it's forming into a head for the rapture
[1:19:28] brother branham says something
[1:19:29] interesting uh elsewhere in the
[1:19:31] invisible
[1:19:32] union of the bride earlier
[1:19:34] earlier on in the message starting in
[1:19:36] paragraph 67 he says and so was god
[1:19:39] manifested in the beginning and finally
[1:19:41] he was he was appeared as jehovah god
[1:19:44] the father then he appeared as god the
[1:19:46] son and jesus christ now he's appearing
[1:19:48] as god the holy ghost the same god all
[1:19:51] the time three manifestations of the
[1:19:53] same god
[1:19:54] now we find in this that each generation
[1:19:57] god has allotted his word from the
[1:19:59] beginning
[1:20:00] just like evolution came
[1:20:03] listen to what the prophet's saying now
[1:20:05] he's not believing in darwinian
[1:20:06] evolution that's not what he's talking
[1:20:08] about but he's talking about when god
[1:20:10] created and we'll just let him say it
[1:20:12] just like evolution came just like the
[1:20:14] first thing god created probably let's
[1:20:16] say he created botany life first then he
[1:20:18] created animal life then he created
[1:20:20] human life next kind of an evolution
[1:20:23] rising higher that's what brother van's
[1:20:25] referring to then in creation god
[1:20:27] started simple and he began to work his
[1:20:29] way up to more complex until finally he
[1:20:32] worked his way up to a man that was made
[1:20:34] in his image
[1:20:36] until finally what he finished with was
[1:20:38] something that reflected him on earth
[1:20:41] that was in his image
[1:20:42] is that right is that what the scripture
[1:20:44] says let us make man in our image
[1:20:46] finally what he got was something on
[1:20:48] earth that was reflecting something from
[1:20:49] the heavenlies
[1:20:51] and it was like in an evolutionary kind
[1:20:53] of way and he began to build up build up
[1:20:56] build up build up coming to the capstone
[1:20:58] amen and the man and the woman united
[1:21:00] together became the capstone of this
[1:21:02] creation and when he was done with that
[1:21:04] he went to rest
[1:21:06] and so now what the the evolution
[1:21:09] brought it all the way up into something
[1:21:10] that would reflect the very life of god
[1:21:14] and he's saying that now he's referring
[1:21:17] to that and he says that as an example
[1:21:19] then he goes on to say so so has it been
[1:21:22] in god and his church
[1:21:24] this evolutionary way
[1:21:26] justification under luther now he's
[1:21:28] going back to the church ages
[1:21:30] justification under luther that's
[1:21:32] pulling his bride out now he's creating
[1:21:34] his bride justification under luther
[1:21:36] sanctification under wesley and so forth
[1:21:38] you see
[1:21:40] the evolution of the spirit
[1:21:42] being given more and more because the
[1:21:44] body is building
[1:21:46] coming to the head which is christ the
[1:21:50] body of christ
[1:21:52] all right i'm going to read that
[1:21:53] sentence again so you don't just file it
[1:21:55] away in different places in our mind
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:58] so you see the evolution of the spirit
[1:22:02] what's he talking about the church ages
[1:22:03] in the church ages there was an
[1:22:05] evolution of the spirit what was it
[1:22:07] doing it was building the body up what
[1:22:09] was it building it to it was building it
[1:22:11] to the head until it come to the very
[1:22:13] image of christ the husband
[1:22:16] so the the church ages was it bright all
[1:22:19] the way down through it was bright all
[1:22:20] the way down through amen mixed into the
[1:22:22] church was the bride amen there was two
[1:22:24] vines growing together we didn't
[1:22:26] understand the church ages brother ben
[1:22:28] went back and he ripped that apart and
[1:22:29] showed us not everything that was called
[1:22:31] church was church but there was a bride
[1:22:33] coming through that all along and they
[1:22:34] are part of the body they are bride just
[1:22:36] as much as you and i are bride
[1:22:38] but there's been an evolution of the
[1:22:40] spirit they didn't look like bride
[1:22:46] but through the evolution of the spirit
[1:22:49] from one age to the next age it's coming
[1:22:52] more and more into the likeness of the
[1:22:55] creator it's coming more and more into
[1:22:57] the likeness of christ himself christ
[1:23:00] brooding over the church through the
[1:23:01] church ages the holy spirit bringing
[1:23:03] them through and in the the evolution of
[1:23:06] the spirit what's it doing it's finally
[1:23:09] building the church into the headship
[1:23:11] amen when the headship and the body
[1:23:13] unite it's building it to the headship
[1:23:15] the body of christ so that at the end
[1:23:17] when the church when the bride is called
[1:23:19] out of the church ages that bride
[1:23:22] through an evolution of the spirit she
[1:23:24] the final bride that will be standing on
[1:23:26] earth at the end time will be brought
[1:23:28] into the very image of her husband
[1:23:31] it didn't look like it in martin's day
[1:23:33] didn't look like it in luther's day
[1:23:35] didn't look like it in wesley's day
[1:23:37] didn't necessarily look like it in
[1:23:38] pentecost day but there's been an
[1:23:40] evolution of the spirit amen we as bride
[1:23:43] are not different than the bride of the
[1:23:44] first stage or the second age we're all
[1:23:46] part of god all children of all god all
[1:23:48] see gene of god but god has been
[1:23:51] building an evolutionary way to where he
[1:23:54] finally gets this end time bride she
[1:23:56] will be the manifestation of the
[1:23:58] headship of christ she will be in the
[1:24:00] very image of jesus christ
[1:24:03] that's the evolution of the spirit
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:08] she will be
[1:24:09] reflecting christ
[1:24:12] on this earth
[1:24:14] she will be the manifestation of christ
[1:24:25] and things that are to be
[1:24:28] he says now if we are those attributes
[1:24:30] of god we cannot live by creeds
[1:24:32] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:24:34] must live by the word because the bride
[1:24:37] is part of the bridegroom so the
[1:24:39] bridegroom is word she must be word
[1:24:42] that's why the word has been restored so
[1:24:44] that we can come subject to the word and
[1:24:46] the word can come into us and manifest
[1:24:48] through us and we can become the
[1:24:49] fullness of the word manifest in the
[1:24:52] bride to reflect jesus christ because
[1:24:54] he's the fullness of the word
[1:24:57] because the bride is part of the
[1:24:58] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[1:25:00] husband therefore we must be that word
[1:25:02] bride and what is the word bride
[1:25:05] the manifestation of this hour
[1:25:09] that's why
[1:25:10] we're not looking anywhere else friends
[1:25:13] we're not looking for another
[1:25:14] manifestation
[1:25:16] amen we
[1:25:17] listen
[1:25:19] just listen to me and understand what
[1:25:21] i'm saying
[1:25:22] it's foolish to look for another
[1:25:24] manifestation we are the manifestation
[1:25:28] what manifestation the manifestation of
[1:25:30] christ for this day so we want to look
[1:25:33] for when this happens then we'll see
[1:25:35] something when this says listen you are
[1:25:37] what is happening
[1:25:40] god is building his headship the bride
[1:25:43] now word by word is beginning to reflect
[1:25:45] the very life of jesus christ in the
[1:25:48] formation of the bride amen it's the
[1:25:50] same life that was in adam is in the
[1:25:53] woman the same life that was in jesus
[1:25:55] christ is in the bride the same body an
[1:25:57] extension of the body the body of christ
[1:26:00] is still growing coming to the headship
[1:26:02] and now that headship has been capped by
[1:26:04] the word himself and that word has come
[1:26:06] into the bride to manifest out of the
[1:26:08] bride and she is the manifestation of
[1:26:11] this hour
[1:26:13] not the manifestation of human beings
[1:26:15] but the manifestation of christ
[1:26:18] the manifestation of the word
[1:26:21] what is the word bride the manifestation
[1:26:23] of this hour the bride not a creed or a
[1:26:25] denomination but a living oracle of god
[1:26:28] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:26:31] the world the attributes of god in the
[1:26:33] formation of the bride that's to be
[1:26:35] expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:26:38] living
[1:26:39] brother brennan preached this december
[1:26:41] 5th
[1:26:42] 1965.
[1:26:44] he preached this just you know just 20
[1:26:47] or 19 days before his accident just
[1:26:50] three four weeks before he passed away
[1:26:52] this was one of his final final set of
[1:26:54] messages that he preached and brother
[1:26:55] branham as he winds down coming to the
[1:26:57] end of his ministry he is making this
[1:26:59] point so clear amen he's driving this
[1:27:02] point home after the seals and he gets
[1:27:04] into 1965 and he's trying to show you
[1:27:07] there's not another manifestation the
[1:27:09] next manifestation will be two witnesses
[1:27:11] to the jews don't look for that you are
[1:27:13] the manifestation of christ christ is
[1:27:15] here in the formation of the bride he
[1:27:17] has returned in the fullness of the word
[1:27:19] the headship has united with the bride
[1:27:22] with the body this body is his body
[1:27:25] flesh and bones if you want to see
[1:27:27] christ you must look to the bride
[1:27:29] because she has to be manifesting christ
[1:27:33] just like if you wanted to see god you
[1:27:35] had to look to jesus christ if you want
[1:27:37] to see christ in this day you must find
[1:27:40] christ because christ is the anointed
[1:27:42] word for the day where is the anointed
[1:27:44] word for the day the anointed word for
[1:27:46] the day is the capping of the church the
[1:27:48] finishing of the bride
[1:27:51] that must be manifest in a people who
[1:27:53] are the body of jesus christ the
[1:27:56] habitation of god in the end time
[1:27:59] so what are we looking for
[1:28:01] what are we waiting for
[1:28:04] waiting for something what what's next
[1:28:06] there is no next friends this is it
[1:28:11] but i'm looking for the catching away at
[1:28:13] the change in the body this brings the
[1:28:15] change of the body amen don't sit and
[1:28:18] wait for something else this word that's
[1:28:20] been restored that's becoming alive
[1:28:22] inside of us is changing our bodies amen
[1:28:25] brother branham said the sid the same
[1:28:26] spirit was in jesus christ be in you
[1:28:28] it'll quicken your mortal body and we've
[1:28:30] looked at that scripture for years as
[1:28:32] the final quickening and changing of the
[1:28:34] body but brother benham takes that
[1:28:36] scripture and says you used to smoke and
[1:28:37] you don't smoke anymore
[1:28:40] you used to drink you used to run around
[1:28:42] you are changing by the same spirit that
[1:28:46] was in him is quickening your mortal
[1:28:48] body and it'll quicken and quicken and
[1:28:51] quicken and quicken until the final
[1:28:53] quickening amen and then you will be
[1:28:55] translated into another dimension and
[1:28:57] you will see him as he is
[1:29:03] so we're not waiting we can't be waiting
[1:29:06] if we're waiting we're missing
[1:29:09] we cannot sit on our hunches and wait
[1:29:11] for the next great thing to come this is
[1:29:13] why keep looking back to brother branham
[1:29:16] and what we have to look at brother babe
[1:29:17] there's no other source for the message
[1:29:18] the message came from him
[1:29:21] but when god finished the forerunner's
[1:29:24] ministry and he used him as a wave chief
[1:29:26] he did all that he was going to do
[1:29:28] through that vessel
[1:29:30] so he took the vessel back home because
[1:29:32] he had finished his purpose he was good
[1:29:34] and faithful to the end and god took him
[1:29:36] on to his reward because the
[1:29:38] manifestation has to move from the
[1:29:40] forerunner and the wave sheath and come
[1:29:42] down to the rest of the harvest to bring
[1:29:44] it to the same ripeness that that wave
[1:29:46] sheep was at
[1:29:48] so if we keep looking back to the wave
[1:29:50] shape we should look to the wave sheet
[1:29:52] for encouragement but if we look for the
[1:29:53] wave sheath to come back the wave she
[1:29:55] won't come back it's already been
[1:29:57] harvested
[1:30:00] remember once the wave chief is taken
[1:30:02] out of the field it's never taken back
[1:30:03] to the field
[1:30:07] it's taken a head
[1:30:08] wave before the lord is an offering and
[1:30:10] taking to the same place the rest of the
[1:30:12] harvest will go
[1:30:16] we can't look back
[1:30:19] we can't look forward
[1:30:21] the only thing we can do is
[1:30:24] realize
[1:30:25] where he's at
[1:30:29] brother ben said how can we fathom it
[1:30:31] how can we understand it
[1:30:34] i don't know that we'll ever completely
[1:30:36] understand it in these bodies
[1:30:39] i don't know that we'll ever completely
[1:30:40] fathom it with these minds
[1:30:43] but friends we're not going anywhere
[1:30:45] until we accept it
[1:30:49] we're not gaining any ground until we
[1:30:51] accept it amen
[1:30:53] we accept
[1:30:54] doctrines and we accept teachings and we
[1:30:56] accept this and that
[1:30:59] but what we must accept today is the
[1:31:02] manifestation of the hour
[1:31:04] and the manifestation of the hour is
[1:31:06] christ and the formation of his bride
[1:31:09] and we can believe everything that
[1:31:11] brother venom did and everything that he
[1:31:12] said and everything that he taught but
[1:31:14] if we're still doubting who we are
[1:31:18] we're still waiting for something to
[1:31:20] come and confirm something to come and
[1:31:22] bring evidence something to show me the
[1:31:24] next step if we're still sitting waiting
[1:31:26] we're missing the manifestation and
[1:31:28] we're missing who we are and we're
[1:31:29] living below our privileges and we're
[1:31:31] sitting on our haunches waiting for
[1:31:33] something to happen when we are the
[1:31:35] thing that is supposed to be happening
[1:31:40] i'm going to read that quote one more
[1:31:42] time
[1:31:44] we must live by the word because the
[1:31:45] bride is part of the bridegroom like any
[1:31:47] wife is part of her husband therefore we
[1:31:49] must be the word bride
[1:31:52] and what is the word bride the
[1:31:53] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[1:31:57] a creed or denomination but a living
[1:31:59] oracle of god a living attribute of god
[1:32:03] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:32:06] of god in the formation of the bride
[1:32:08] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:32:11] we're now living
[1:32:13] i don't know how you can miss it
[1:32:16] i don't know how we can believe it any
[1:32:18] other way the prophet made it so plain
[1:32:22] the manifestation of the hour is a
[1:32:24] people on the earth who are the living
[1:32:26] oracle of god
[1:32:27] who are the living attribute of god not
[1:32:30] waiting to live but living
[1:32:35] displaying to the world not waiting to
[1:32:38] display but displaying to the world
[1:32:40] the attributes of god in the formation
[1:32:42] of the bride do you believe you're part
[1:32:44] of the bride then you're part of this
[1:32:45] manifestation then the manifestation of
[1:32:48] christ is in you
[1:32:50] then you are the manifestation of this
[1:32:52] hour not you singularly but you as part
[1:32:55] of a body you are part of this
[1:32:57] manifestation of this hour there is
[1:32:59] nothing to wait for we're here to take
[1:33:01] this word and live it we're here to take
[1:33:03] this word and believe it we're here to
[1:33:05] say whatever you say i am i'll say amen
[1:33:07] to because i have to receive your word
[1:33:10] and if your prophet said this is what i
[1:33:12] am even though i can see faults i can
[1:33:15] see frailties i can see inabilities i
[1:33:18] can see my own stumblings amen i cannot
[1:33:20] look at the natural anymore and make it
[1:33:22] one step further i've got to look to
[1:33:24] what a prophet of god said in this day
[1:33:26] because he was vindicated to make the
[1:33:28] statements that he made and the
[1:33:30] statements that he made were exactly
[1:33:32] what the apostle paul taught us
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:35] and we have to get beyond ourselves and
[1:33:37] look to god amen that's why this message
[1:33:40] could carry us beyond our thinking
[1:33:43] beyond denominational thinking beyond
[1:33:45] thousands of years of church history and
[1:33:47] take us back to the original thought of
[1:33:49] god before the foundation of the world
[1:33:51] and if you by faith can find yourself in
[1:33:53] that thought then you are here to
[1:33:55] express what he thought there to express
[1:33:57] it here
[1:33:59] and that thought is an actual physical
[1:34:03] part of god
[1:34:05] because what about the thoughts of god
[1:34:07] they are literal
[1:34:09] are they not
[1:34:10] those thoughts are attributes those
[1:34:12] attributes are seed genes those thoughts
[1:34:14] are literal parts of god and god has
[1:34:17] sown that part of the earth that part of
[1:34:19] himself into a vessel of clay amen so
[1:34:23] that this vessel of clay by the
[1:34:24] anointing of his spirit can express that
[1:34:27] thought in this day
[1:34:30] you say but brother chad i haven't won
[1:34:32] souls i haven't preached in the corner
[1:34:34] he wants to express that thought in a
[1:34:36] janitor and he wants to express that
[1:34:38] thought and a preacher he wants to
[1:34:40] express that thought and a sunday school
[1:34:42] teacher he wants to express that thought
[1:34:43] and a mom that thought and a dad that
[1:34:46] thought in a teenager that thought in a
[1:34:48] child who will say i believe the word
[1:34:51] that thought and and a widow or a
[1:34:53] widower or a single amen this thoughts
[1:34:55] god knew where you would be god knew you
[1:34:58] would be in the condition you're in
[1:34:59] there's no reason to sit around and pow
[1:35:01] amen and puff and snort about how bad my
[1:35:04] condition is god before the foundation
[1:35:05] of the world knew you would be in this
[1:35:07] condition and he ordained one of his
[1:35:09] thoughts his attributes to express
[1:35:11] christ in your condition
[1:35:13] in your marriage situation and your
[1:35:16] problems from the past and you're
[1:35:17] difficult in finances and your and your
[1:35:20] inabilities and you're all of this he
[1:35:22] chose before the foundation of the world
[1:35:24] knowing what you would be in this hour
[1:35:27] you say how can god use me i'm in this
[1:35:29] situation how can god use thee me i'm
[1:35:31] all alone how can god use me i have no
[1:35:33] talents or abilities who gives talents
[1:35:36] or abilities
[1:35:38] how can you sin say i can't serve god he
[1:35:40] didn't give me what i needed what are
[1:35:42] you saying about the plan of god
[1:35:46] well if god will give me this then i'll
[1:35:47] do this
[1:35:50] god has given you exactly what you need
[1:35:54] march forward and believe that if he
[1:35:56] said that i'm part of the bride and the
[1:35:58] bride is the manifestation of this hour
[1:36:00] then i am the manifestation of christ
[1:36:03] for this hour god wants to manifest
[1:36:05] through me he wants to show his love he
[1:36:07] wants to show his character he wants to
[1:36:09] show his characteristics when i'm at
[1:36:11] work when i'm at the grocery store when
[1:36:13] i'm with my family when i'm with
[1:36:14] believers when i'm with unbelievers he
[1:36:17] wants to show himself in this vessel
[1:36:22] amen if we can really catch that every
[1:36:24] moment of every day it'll change the way
[1:36:26] you shop for groceries
[1:36:30] you will not be bumping your cart
[1:36:33] to get first in line anymore
[1:36:38] it'll change the way we live when we
[1:36:40] realize that this is the truth
[1:36:44] we want so many things in our lives to
[1:36:46] change but what needs to change is our
[1:36:48] revelation and our understanding
[1:36:51] because with the right revelation our
[1:36:52] actions automatically start changing
[1:36:58] we'll believe that the bride is the
[1:37:00] manifestation of the word for this hour
[1:37:02] we believe that
[1:37:04] but when it comes down to the personal
[1:37:08] every day the words coming out of the
[1:37:10] mouth the actions that
[1:37:12] we we begin to take that personal
[1:37:14] manifestation of christ and we begin to
[1:37:17] spread it globally over the bride
[1:37:20] because it's easy that revelation is
[1:37:23] easy
[1:37:25] that god has a body on the earth
[1:37:27] absolutely they are the body of christ
[1:37:29] they are manifesting christ that body
[1:37:31] globally and that's the truth that's a
[1:37:33] true revelation
[1:37:35] but it's so easy to hide an individual
[1:37:39] responsibility under the cloak of a
[1:37:41] global bride
[1:37:45] but the revelation brother benham said
[1:37:47] is to the individual one person all hell
[1:37:50] is against this revelation the
[1:37:52] revelation to the individual
[1:37:57] saying that the bride is the
[1:37:58] manifestation of this hour that's fine
[1:38:00] you can repeat that you can say that you
[1:38:02] can believe that
[1:38:05] but faith has to go deeper
[1:38:08] and say
[1:38:09] you know what
[1:38:11] say like apostle paul i'm not worthy to
[1:38:14] be called bride
[1:38:17] i'm not worthy paul said i'm not worthy
[1:38:19] to be called an apostle he said i'm
[1:38:21] least of the apostles and not worthy to
[1:38:23] be called an apostle
[1:38:24] because i've persecuted the church he's
[1:38:26] looking at his own human failures
[1:38:28] he said i'm least of the apostles and
[1:38:30] not worthy to be called an apostle
[1:38:33] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:38:39] you know what
[1:38:40] i may be least of his bride
[1:38:43] and i can assure you i'm not worthy to
[1:38:46] be called bride
[1:38:48] i can assure you and if you want a list
[1:38:50] of reasons why i'm not worthy come and
[1:38:52] see me afterwards i can give you i can
[1:38:54] fill tablets full of reasons why i'm not
[1:38:57] worthy to be bride
[1:38:59] a lot of stuff i did years ago stuff
[1:39:00] i've done in the last week or two
[1:39:04] but is there something in you that can
[1:39:06] say i'm least i'm not even worthy i
[1:39:09] shouldn't even take this title but by
[1:39:11] the grace of god i am what i am he's put
[1:39:14] a revelation in my heart that says
[1:39:15] whatever that brother's preaching
[1:39:17] whatever that brother's saying on that
[1:39:18] message tape and when i read this book
[1:39:20] that's me i know it's me when i look
[1:39:22] into the mirror of the word i know it's
[1:39:24] me i know i'm not worthy i know i
[1:39:26] shouldn't be i know i can't do it but
[1:39:28] it's me it's me mama it's me i'm looking
[1:39:31] at me
[1:39:33] when brother brahm takes us to the back
[1:39:35] part of god's mind and he begins to
[1:39:36] explain what god was thinking and doing
[1:39:39] something inside of us says that's
[1:39:40] familiar territory i was there i don't
[1:39:44] have any conscious memory of it but
[1:39:46] something down inside of me is jumping
[1:39:48] and leaping at the thought that i was
[1:39:50] there
[1:39:52] and now i am here because he has a
[1:39:54] purpose for my individual life for that
[1:39:57] thought that attribute amen is here to
[1:40:00] manifest christ in this hour and i
[1:40:03] refuse to wait another day for something
[1:40:06] else to happen everything that's
[1:40:07] supposed to happen to get me to manifest
[1:40:09] christ has already happened
[1:40:12] but i have to believe what he said about
[1:40:15] me
[1:40:17] and i have to move forward with faith
[1:40:19] saying if there's anybody on this earth
[1:40:22] that is supposed to be a living word a
[1:40:24] living epistle jesus christ in flesh
[1:40:26] it's got to be me because that's what my
[1:40:28] revelation tells me who i am
[1:40:31] and if nobody else can take that
[1:40:33] position i can take that position
[1:40:37] what does that mean what will we do next
[1:40:38] brother chad
[1:40:39] go do the same thing you did the day
[1:40:41] before
[1:40:44] stay where god planted you be where god
[1:40:46] put you be who he called you to be but
[1:40:48] be christ in that tabernacle
[1:40:52] let the word rule
[1:40:54] let his life
[1:40:56] let his spirit his life take dominion
[1:40:59] the second fold of his great threefold
[1:41:01] purpose would get three eminence in a
[1:41:02] people
[1:41:05] so what what are we to do you know we
[1:41:08] can't do much
[1:41:10] i'm talking humanly speaking
[1:41:12] what can you do what can you change
[1:41:15] can you change your circumstances can
[1:41:17] you change humanly speaking there's very
[1:41:19] little that you can do
[1:41:21] you can't do anything
[1:41:26] but i know
[1:41:28] that with him
[1:41:30] all things are possible
[1:41:33] it's not what i can do
[1:41:35] because that's not what god wants
[1:41:39] but it's what i can surrender myself to
[1:41:42] that he can come and do through me
[1:41:44] that's the works he wants to do
[1:41:47] he does not want you and i to do works
[1:41:51] because all of our works is his filthy
[1:41:53] rags
[1:41:55] so if we are doing our works that's
[1:41:57] filthy rags
[1:41:59] but if he comes in through us and does
[1:42:01] his works that's works of righteousness
[1:42:04] so it's not what we can do it's what we
[1:42:07] can surrender ourselves to
[1:42:09] brother brennan said i wasn't the one
[1:42:11] who said those things i wasn't the one
[1:42:13] who appeared on the river i wasn't the
[1:42:15] one
[1:42:16] who told those things that would happen
[1:42:18] i was only standing near when he did
[1:42:20] that
[1:42:22] because god did not want brother branham
[1:42:24] to do his own works he wanted brother
[1:42:26] branham amen to surrender to him so he
[1:42:29] could get preeminence in that man and
[1:42:30] through preeminence in that man that man
[1:42:32] could manifest christ
[1:42:35] did brother brenda manifest christ
[1:42:37] praise god
[1:42:39] how through surrender
[1:42:41] through giving preeminence
[1:42:43] that's our wrestling match that's our
[1:42:45] battle that's where we're fighting every
[1:42:46] day is to give him a greater preeminence
[1:42:51] brother braham goes on to say in the
[1:42:52] message god's provided place of worship
[1:42:55] now jesus himself
[1:42:57] excuse me at that day
[1:43:00] when the son of man is being revealed in
[1:43:02] other words the son of man
[1:43:04] the ministry of jesus christ himself
[1:43:07] so what is the son of man ministry the
[1:43:08] ministry of jesus christ himself
[1:43:12] the church will come through
[1:43:13] justification through luther through
[1:43:14] sanctification through wesley through
[1:43:16] the baptism of the holy ghost or the
[1:43:18] pentecostals and go right on into the
[1:43:21] perfection of the son of man when
[1:43:24] husband and wife will be the same
[1:43:26] self
[1:43:28] persons
[1:43:30] is it two or is it one
[1:43:33] what does god see
[1:43:35] christ in you
[1:43:37] the hope of glory
[1:43:39] christ
[1:43:40] in his body the headship
[1:43:42] has come to the body
[1:43:45] making
[1:43:46] one unit
[1:43:48] not two
[1:43:49] one
[1:43:53] god will be so manifested into his bride
[1:43:55] his church till they will both be the
[1:43:57] same they are one
[1:44:00] now you see where we're at
[1:44:06] where is he at
[1:44:08] where is he at i'm watching for him
[1:44:11] you've missed it
[1:44:14] because he's here in bride form
[1:44:17] and the message turned on the light he
[1:44:19] says and from the
[1:44:20] from the ripening of the grain from all
[1:44:22] the way back from luther all the way
[1:44:23] down through the age it ought to be the
[1:44:25] fullness of the gospel now the power of
[1:44:27] god ripen the light that's been shown
[1:44:29] through justification sanctification the
[1:44:31] pentecostal age ought to ripen the bride
[1:44:33] tree for the coming of the lord jesus
[1:44:35] christ
[1:44:36] that christ could be manifested in his
[1:44:39] church as one person
[1:44:42] so what is the coming of the lord jesus
[1:44:44] christ that christ could be manifested
[1:44:46] in his church as one person
[1:44:49] it's christ in you
[1:44:51] the hope of glory
[1:44:53] him and his wife him and his bride amen
[1:44:56] this is the hour we're living
[1:44:59] this is the light of the day walk in it
[1:45:03] be saved all the ends of the earth what
[1:45:05] is the life of the a jesus christ coming
[1:45:08] down into his body and being one person
[1:45:12] the message christ has revealed in his
[1:45:13] own word he says now the next thing
[1:45:15] happens is when it's all gathered up
[1:45:17] into that one person jesus christ bride
[1:45:20] and body at the physical return of the
[1:45:22] lord jesus making his three times when
[1:45:25] he was brought on earth killed crucified
[1:45:27] raised up
[1:45:28] manifesting himself in the form of his
[1:45:30] body which is his bride the woman you
[1:45:33] get it she is part of his body
[1:45:36] let's turn to romans chapter 8. i want
[1:45:38] to read two more scriptures
[1:45:41] romans chapter 8.
[1:45:44] and verse 28.
[1:45:55] romans 8 28 and we know that all things
[1:45:57] work together for good
[1:45:59] to them who love god to them who are the
[1:46:01] cult according to his purpose
[1:46:03] for whom he did for know he also did
[1:46:05] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:46:09] image of his son
[1:46:11] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:46:13] many brethren
[1:46:15] friends we have been predestinated to be
[1:46:17] conformed into the image of his son
[1:46:21] just as jesus christ was the image of
[1:46:23] the invisible god we've been
[1:46:26] predestinated to be conformed into the
[1:46:28] image of the sun
[1:46:30] so that now the image of the sun is
[1:46:32] reflected in the bride
[1:46:36] let's go to ii corinthians
[1:46:39] chapter 3
[1:46:44] and verse 17.
[1:46:52] ii corinthians 3 17.
[1:47:03] now
[1:47:04] the lord is that spirit and where the
[1:47:05] spirit of the lord is there is liberty
[1:47:08] but we all with open face behold as in a
[1:47:10] glass the glory of the lord are changed
[1:47:13] into the same
[1:47:14] image
[1:47:17] jesus became the image of the invisible
[1:47:19] god
[1:47:20] but we through an open face of
[1:47:22] revelation of the word on this last day
[1:47:24] are looking into a glass this word
[1:47:27] and as we look into the word
[1:47:29] in the glass the glory of the lord are
[1:47:31] changed into the same image from glory
[1:47:34] to glory
[1:47:35] even as by the spirit of the lord
[1:47:39] the bride
[1:47:40] is coming into the image of the
[1:47:42] bridegroom
[1:47:44] the bridegroom is reflected in the bride
[1:47:47] she is here to manifest him
[1:47:51] she is his body
[1:47:53] she is the habitation of god she is the
[1:47:56] abode of christ she is where his spirit
[1:47:59] is dwelling she is manifesting the word
[1:48:03] for this day
[1:48:05] in the message when their eyes were open
[1:48:07] they knew him lord let bible readers
[1:48:09] hear tonight see the truth let them see
[1:48:12] that malachi 4 that this anointing is
[1:48:14] supposed to come and to restore back
[1:48:15] again that faith that the father's once
[1:48:17] seen
[1:48:18] the revelation of god in christ now may
[1:48:21] they see the revelation of god in human
[1:48:23] beings
[1:48:24] christ manifested in the flesh of his
[1:48:26] church walking among us
[1:48:31] praise god i hope we're becoming
[1:48:33] convinced
[1:48:35] and the seed is not heir with the shuck
[1:48:36] he says
[1:48:40] yeah that's what the church is doing
[1:48:42] today for jesus is the word and he is
[1:48:44] the bridegroom and the bride is part of
[1:48:46] the groom
[1:48:47] therefore the word that is to be
[1:48:48] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[1:48:50] the word that was fulfilled in his day
[1:48:52] and it's the same word same experience
[1:48:54] same life
[1:48:55] for when god separated adam he was both
[1:48:58] we find out adam was spirit to begin
[1:49:00] with he made him in his own image
[1:49:02] created he male and female and then
[1:49:03] genesis 2 and on he created man out of
[1:49:06] the dust of the earth man was created in
[1:49:08] his image god is spirit so he's a spirit
[1:49:11] man then when he became flesh man animal
[1:49:13] flesh on the earth he is showing
[1:49:15] portraying here the bride he never taken
[1:49:18] and made another being
[1:49:22] oh that's good
[1:49:24] he never taken and made another being
[1:49:27] but he took part of adam the original
[1:49:29] creation took from him a rib from his
[1:49:31] side and took the feminist spirit out of
[1:49:33] adam left the masculine spirit in there
[1:49:36] and placed it in the feminist part
[1:49:37] therefore part of his spirit part of his
[1:49:40] body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:49:42] word of his word life of his life and
[1:49:45] that's the way the bride is to christ
[1:49:49] brother very clearly said he never taken
[1:49:51] and made another being the woman was not
[1:49:54] another being
[1:49:57] she was another part of the same being
[1:50:02] first corinthians chapter 11.
[1:50:06] we're coming to the finish but stay with
[1:50:08] me i want to read a few more
[1:50:12] first corinthians 11 verse 7.
[1:50:16] first corinthians 11 and 7 for a man
[1:50:19] indeed ought not to cover his head for
[1:50:20] as much as he is the image and glory of
[1:50:23] god
[1:50:25] beautiful
[1:50:27] but the woman
[1:50:28] is the glory of the man
[1:50:31] for the man is not of the woman but the
[1:50:34] woman of the man
[1:50:36] so the man was the image and glory of
[1:50:38] god when god created a man that man was
[1:50:40] reflecting god on the earth but the
[1:50:43] woman was the glory of the man she was
[1:50:45] reflecting the man and when jesus christ
[1:50:48] come he was the image of the invisible
[1:50:50] god he was reflecting god but out of
[1:50:52] christ would come his bride and his
[1:50:55] bride would be united back to him and
[1:50:57] now his bride is the glory of her
[1:50:59] husband she is the manifestation she is
[1:51:03] the revelation of christ in this hour
[1:51:08] and the message modern events may clear
[1:51:10] by prophecy he says and so
[1:51:13] will the church come through
[1:51:14] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:51:17] holy ghost restoration of the gifts
[1:51:19] right on into the formed image of christ
[1:51:24] christ the bridegroom the church is the
[1:51:26] bride and the bride is part of the
[1:51:28] bridegroom so from justification you go
[1:51:31] to sanctification from sanctification to
[1:51:33] the baptism holy ghost which brother
[1:51:35] branham calls the restoration of the
[1:51:36] gifts and from there where do you go
[1:51:39] next
[1:51:40] right on into the formed image of christ
[1:51:45] what is the end time bride the formed
[1:51:48] image of christ the evolution of the
[1:51:50] spirit has brought her all the way up to
[1:51:52] where now this bride on the earth in the
[1:51:55] end time is in the image of her
[1:51:57] bridegroom
[1:52:00] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:52:03] and his church stands alone she is not
[1:52:05] hooked with nothing
[1:52:07] but he was identified by god being the
[1:52:09] body that god dwelt in
[1:52:11] and the church is identified by his body
[1:52:15] doing the same thing
[1:52:17] oh
[1:52:18] let's read that again but he was
[1:52:19] identified by god being the body that
[1:52:22] god dwelled in so who was jesus christ
[1:52:25] he was identified by god being the body
[1:52:27] that god dwelt in and the church is
[1:52:29] identified by his body doing the same
[1:52:32] thing what is she she is the body that
[1:52:34] he's dwelling in
[1:52:37] she is his body the manifested truth of
[1:52:39] his promised word for the last days and
[1:52:42] she and she alone
[1:52:45] stands by it
[1:52:47] do you think you'll get anybody else to
[1:52:48] agree with you
[1:52:50] do you think we'll get any of the
[1:52:51] denominations to agree that christ is in
[1:52:54] his bride
[1:52:55] and his bride has been called out by the
[1:52:57] message of the hour you cannot be bride
[1:52:59] until you're called out by the message
[1:53:01] of the hour if your bride you will be
[1:53:03] called out of the nomination by the
[1:53:05] message of the hour you won't stay in
[1:53:06] denomination
[1:53:09] you will be called out by the message of
[1:53:11] the hour and you will be called out and
[1:53:13] united with your bridegroom which is the
[1:53:15] restored word amen
[1:53:17] and under that unification unite with
[1:53:19] the with the bridegroom the headship now
[1:53:21] comes to the body and now you are the
[1:53:24] manifestation of the hour you are the
[1:53:26] manifestation of the word for this hour
[1:53:29] and christ is the word the anointed word
[1:53:31] for the hour
[1:53:32] and you are his body the manifested
[1:53:34] truth of his promised word for the last
[1:53:37] days
[1:53:38] and you cannot find it anywhere else
[1:53:43] that stumbles people so bad but we know
[1:53:46] where christ is we know where the word
[1:53:48] has been restored and we should not be
[1:53:50] ashamed of that because when we're
[1:53:51] ashamed of that we're denying people
[1:53:53] access to christ
[1:53:56] because the word did not come amen to
[1:53:59] keep us all in our systems the word came
[1:54:01] to bring us to christ to unite with
[1:54:03] christ so that christ could dwell in us
[1:54:05] in fullness
[1:54:06] through the evolution of the spirit so
[1:54:08] that this end time bride can be formed
[1:54:10] into the very image of jesus christ
[1:54:14] and we cannot be afraid of that we
[1:54:16] cannot be ashamed of that because that
[1:54:19] is the message
[1:54:21] the message is not just restoring
[1:54:23] doctrines the restoration of the
[1:54:25] doctrines was to put the church back in
[1:54:26] order amen to bring her into an
[1:54:28] invisible union with christ her mate to
[1:54:31] the headship could unite with the body
[1:54:33] so that the body could reflect the very
[1:54:35] life of the bridegroom amen and be a
[1:54:37] manifestation of christ in full measure
[1:54:39] in this day that's the message so we
[1:54:41] can't just tell somebody about water
[1:54:43] baptism and say you stay in your system
[1:54:45] and just be baptized in water the right
[1:54:47] way no you come all the way into christ
[1:54:49] and christ will come all the way into
[1:54:51] you and in that day you'll know that
[1:54:53] he's in the father the father and him
[1:54:54] he's in you and you're in him and the
[1:54:56] very manifestation of this hour is
[1:54:58] living in you
[1:55:02] and she and she alone stands by it and
[1:55:04] that's what the devil's howling about
[1:55:06] the promise of this word being in her
[1:55:08] alone
[1:55:10] what does the devil hate what does
[1:55:11] systems hate why do even people who
[1:55:14] claim to believe the message they hate
[1:55:15] they hate the fact that this truth is in
[1:55:17] her only
[1:55:19] that the ark is the message that christ
[1:55:21] is the word and that word is formed into
[1:55:23] a bride in this last day and outside of
[1:55:26] that there's no way to be saved in this
[1:55:28] end time
[1:55:29] that it is the ark of safety that it is
[1:55:31] the rescue from the world that it is the
[1:55:33] escape from the tribulation
[1:55:36] it is found the word is found in her
[1:55:39] amen it's not her it's in her
[1:55:43] manifesting through her
[1:55:47] we either believe the message or we
[1:55:48] don't
[1:55:52] we can believe what happened
[1:55:55] but everybody has always been able to
[1:55:57] believe what happened
[1:56:00] and the further distance you get away
[1:56:03] from the event the easier it is to
[1:56:04] believe what happened
[1:56:07] that's the way it's always been
[1:56:10] it's always been confusing in the day
[1:56:12] when the word is manifest there's always
[1:56:13] been a turmoil of fight and always been
[1:56:15] a minority that would receive it but the
[1:56:17] further you get away from that
[1:56:18] manifestation the easier it is to
[1:56:20] receive
[1:56:22] just like they could not accept joan of
[1:56:24] arc being a prophetess that she couldn't
[1:56:26] accept her being spiritual so they
[1:56:27] killed her but years later they realized
[1:56:29] that she was spiritual so they dug up
[1:56:31] those priest bones that had her killed
[1:56:32] and they threw them in the river
[1:56:34] because now they're believers
[1:56:36] hundreds of years later
[1:56:39] so it's easy to believe what was
[1:56:42] but where's the challenge the challenge
[1:56:44] is always believing what is
[1:56:47] the present tense manifested word where
[1:56:50] is jesus christ he's on earth
[1:56:55] he is in a body of flesh right now what
[1:56:58] flesh your flesh my flesh the flesh of
[1:57:01] his body which is his church which is
[1:57:04] his bride that has been called out by a
[1:57:06] prophetic message in the end time and
[1:57:08] sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:57:10] when the word was released and come back
[1:57:12] upon a people the headship and the body
[1:57:14] has united signifying the capstone seals
[1:57:17] the building and says this is my place
[1:57:19] of abode
[1:57:22] and it's in her and her only and she
[1:57:25] stands alone upon this word
[1:57:29] but if you're ashamed of that you're
[1:57:31] denying people the truth
[1:57:35] because this is the truth
[1:57:38] it is the only truth for this day it is
[1:57:41] the manifestation of the word in this
[1:57:43] hour it is the place of salvation it is
[1:57:46] the ark of safety it is the place of the
[1:57:49] rapture
[1:57:51] it's in him
[1:57:53] and he's in her
[1:57:55] and the word has come to her again
[1:57:58] we shouldn't be afraid to tell people
[1:58:05] peter
[1:58:06] paul
[1:58:07] james and john
[1:58:10] they had a message of salvation
[1:58:13] and they preached it true
[1:58:16] because it was the only way for their
[1:58:17] day
[1:58:19] old paschal lamb had failed
[1:58:22] and now had become the lamb of god
[1:58:25] and they could not continue to say
[1:58:27] you're fine you're fine you're fine they
[1:58:28] said no you're no longer fine there
[1:58:31] you're no longer it's no longer okay to
[1:58:33] go back and do what we've done for now
[1:58:35] the lamb of god has come and he's been
[1:58:37] slain and when those priests lifted him
[1:58:39] up now it moved from the paschal lamb to
[1:58:41] the lamb of god
[1:58:44] but brother benham said it was it was
[1:58:47] the lamb and luther's day and it was the
[1:58:48] lamb and wesley's day what does he mean
[1:58:50] looking back
[1:58:52] to the slain lamb
[1:58:55] he said but now it's token time
[1:58:59] now it's not looking back but now it's
[1:59:01] looking to who has come
[1:59:04] it's token time the very life of jesus
[1:59:06] christ has entered into his bride
[1:59:09] he is here
[1:59:11] there is a place of safety
[1:59:13] that's in him
[1:59:16] in the message the identification of
[1:59:18] christ in all ages
[1:59:20] said heavenly father we are grateful to
[1:59:22] see the risen messiah 1900 years of all
[1:59:26] kinds of theology and movements but
[1:59:27] still in the darkness of all of it you
[1:59:30] promised that you would appear here in
[1:59:32] the last days in the sodom day
[1:59:34] and you would make yourself known to the
[1:59:36] children of abraham the called the
[1:59:38] elected
[1:59:39] and here you are tonight after 1900
[1:59:41] years you're just as much alive tonight
[1:59:43] as you was when you talked to the woman
[1:59:44] at the well
[1:59:46] it's god manifested in flesh now
[1:59:49] in the flesh of his bride for the bride
[1:59:52] and the husband is the same
[1:59:55] self
[1:59:56] flesh
[1:59:59] this is why i told you i was going to
[2:00:01] read a lot this morning
[2:00:03] because the prophet can say it he's got
[2:00:04] the authority and the vindication to say
[2:00:07] it
[2:00:09] but i have by grace that's given to me
[2:00:11] the faith to say that's nothing but the
[2:00:13] truth
[2:00:15] i didn't have the vindication to say it
[2:00:17] i didn't have the authority to make that
[2:00:19] statement but i by the grace that god
[2:00:21] has given to me by faith that's been
[2:00:23] planted deep in my heart i have the
[2:00:25] authority to say that's nothing but the
[2:00:26] truth i believe it exactly that way amen
[2:00:30] the bride and the husband is the
[2:00:31] self-same flesh
[2:00:34] these two are one and the church is
[2:00:35] becoming the bride listen to this
[2:00:38] the church is becoming the bride all the
[2:00:40] time
[2:00:41] by believing the word
[2:00:45] i want to be the bride make me bride the
[2:00:47] church is becoming the bride all the
[2:00:49] time by believing the word
[2:00:52] what word the restored word
[2:00:55] by believing
[2:00:57] the the sorry
[2:00:58] the church is becoming the bride all the
[2:01:00] time by believing the word so that the
[2:01:02] word in the church becomes the same
[2:01:05] the word in the church making it the
[2:01:08] bride
[2:01:09] the last
[2:01:10] sign
[2:01:14] the last sign
[2:01:17] god identifying himself the word
[2:01:20] in the church
[2:01:24] what are you looking for
[2:01:27] i can tell you
[2:01:28] don't look any farther
[2:01:31] if you want to find him
[2:01:32] he's here
[2:01:34] he's in bright form
[2:01:36] the word has come
[2:01:38] and the word is in her
[2:01:41] and there is a mouthpiece of god on the
[2:01:43] earth in the end time
[2:01:45] and the bride
[2:01:46] under her prophet
[2:01:48] is the final voice
[2:01:50] to the final age
[2:01:52] what is her voice crying
[2:01:54] come out from among them and be separate
[2:01:57] and he will receive you
[2:02:01] and the message of christ is the mystery
[2:02:03] of god revealed
[2:02:05] this is the i believe the last quote
[2:02:06] that i read
[2:02:08] he said oh if i could get the word to
[2:02:11] see that if i could get the world to see
[2:02:12] that
[2:02:13] why there you are there is the body of
[2:02:15] christ living standing redeemed redeemed
[2:02:19] oh my
[2:02:21] justified in his sight why are we
[2:02:23] justified we are his victory
[2:02:29] let that soak in
[2:02:31] that you are his victory
[2:02:34] it's not your victory
[2:02:36] it's his victory
[2:02:39] it's not what you want it's what he
[2:02:41] wants it's not what you're doing it's
[2:02:42] what he's doing it's not your victory
[2:02:44] it's his victory
[2:02:48] the church is his victory
[2:02:51] you come forth in the last days with
[2:02:53] this glorious gospel showing his victory
[2:02:56] he died for this purpose and we are
[2:02:58] proof of his victory when we see him
[2:03:00] coming down and living among the church
[2:03:02] that's his victory
[2:03:04] shows that he couldn't keep him in the
[2:03:06] grave neither can they keep us that's
[2:03:07] right and we're already potentially
[2:03:10] arise because we've raised from dead
[2:03:12] unbelief in his word from denominational
[2:03:14] creeds to an eternal word of the eternal
[2:03:16] god which is him himself working through
[2:03:19] us manifesting himself that he is the
[2:03:21] same yesterday today and forever
[2:03:25] and then the word moves on down into the
[2:03:27] body from the head what is it the same
[2:03:29] word nothing can be added or taken from
[2:03:31] it so that same word moves from the head
[2:03:34] as the day comes close down into the
[2:03:36] body down into the body vindicating that
[2:03:38] they are one they are husband and wife
[2:03:41] they are flesh of his flesh word of his
[2:03:43] word life of his life spirit of his
[2:03:45] spirit amen how do you know it bears the
[2:03:48] same record same fruit same word see
[2:03:51] manifest christ the same life same god
[2:03:54] same spirit same word same book amen
[2:03:57] same signs the things that i do shall
[2:03:59] you also oh hallelujah my
[2:04:02] did you catch how many times he said
[2:04:04] same
[2:04:06] not different
[2:04:07] same
[2:04:09] notice the vindicated word in his body
[2:04:12] is his victory
[2:04:14] and the reason of his death
[2:04:18] if we don't have the vindicated word in
[2:04:20] his body then he died in vain
[2:04:24] but the reason of his death and his
[2:04:25] victory is the vindicated word in his
[2:04:28] body he wanted to come to his body he
[2:04:32] wanted to be united with the bride again
[2:04:35] to restore eden again
[2:04:39] the vindicated word in his body is his
[2:04:40] very victory in the reason of his death
[2:04:42] see the death not in the spirit when he
[2:04:44] died he only died in the flesh his
[2:04:46] spirit went to hell and preached to the
[2:04:48] souls in prison that right his flesh
[2:04:50] only died when he raised it up again and
[2:04:52] quickened him quicker means man
[2:04:54] made alive
[2:04:56] his flesh which was his body and that's
[2:04:58] the word
[2:04:59] it's been laying dead for years
[2:05:02] catch this so his flesh which is the
[2:05:05] word
[2:05:06] has been laying dead for years
[2:05:10] but it gradually began to come in the
[2:05:12] reformation
[2:05:16] did he say his body
[2:05:20] his body which is the word his body is
[2:05:23] his male
[2:05:25] his
[2:05:27] his body
[2:05:29] listen i'm going to take two objects
[2:05:31] here
[2:05:35] okay his body
[2:05:37] has been laying dead
[2:05:40] for years
[2:05:42] but it gradually began to come in the
[2:05:44] reformation
[2:05:46] but i thought what was coming up in the
[2:05:48] reformation was her body
[2:05:51] i'm seeing plural again
[2:05:53] but brother branham is not speaking
[2:05:55] plural
[2:05:57] he is not speaking double he is not
[2:06:00] speaking of two bodies
[2:06:02] when we read something like that we
[2:06:04] automatically go his body's been like
[2:06:06] his body which is the word because he's
[2:06:08] the word made flesh has been laying dead
[2:06:09] for years but has gradually come up in
[2:06:11] the reformation and as soon as he say
[2:06:12] come up reformation you start seeing her
[2:06:14] body
[2:06:16] but her body is his body
[2:06:19] it is the body he dwells in it is the
[2:06:21] body he lives in in the end time it is
[2:06:23] the body that he is expressing through
[2:06:25] her body is his body and listen to what
[2:06:28] he says
[2:06:29] and that's the word it's been laying
[2:06:30] dead for years but it gradually began to
[2:06:32] come in the reformation and now she is
[2:06:34] standing upon her feet who's she she is
[2:06:38] he his body is now her standing on her
[2:06:40] feet
[2:06:41] she's come through the reformation
[2:06:43] through luther through wesley through
[2:06:44] the restoration of gifts and now into
[2:06:46] the formed image of jesus christ because
[2:06:49] we with an open face have been beholding
[2:06:51] in a glass darkly the glory of the lord
[2:06:53] are being changed into the same image
[2:06:56] what image the image of the word what is
[2:06:59] the word jesus christ by the revelation
[2:07:02] of the hour that has taken the veil off
[2:07:04] has given us a looking glass to look
[2:07:06] into and as we behold the lord of glory
[2:07:10] we are being changed into the same image
[2:07:12] that we're seeing from glory
[2:07:14] unto glory
[2:07:17] until you keep looking so long that you
[2:07:19] become him
[2:07:21] and he becomes you
[2:07:23] and he is she and in that day you'll
[2:07:25] know that i am in the father the father
[2:07:27] in me i in you and you and me
[2:07:30] and brother ben when he reads it he says
[2:07:32] making them all
[2:07:34] one
[2:07:37] she is now
[2:07:38] now she is standing upon her feet
[2:07:41] oh how i wish i had time to go back and
[2:07:43] do ezekiel and pull out them dry bones
[2:07:45] and show you he said can these bones
[2:07:47] live again
[2:07:48] he said prophesy how can prophecy come
[2:07:51] only through the prophet it's the word
[2:07:52] of the lord hear hear ye dry bones the
[2:07:55] word of the lord and sin you skin came
[2:07:58] upon them and they stood up a mighty
[2:08:00] army and began to march toward zion
[2:08:01] glory to god that's him that's him the
[2:08:05] victory
[2:08:07] what is his victory in the reason of his
[2:08:08] death the manifested word in his church
[2:08:11] he
[2:08:12] living his life in the bride in the end
[2:08:15] time
[2:08:16] is his victory
[2:08:18] and the purpose of his death
[2:08:20] and the revelation of christ in you
[2:08:23] makes you the revelation of the whole
[2:08:25] thing
[2:08:27] god help us to understand that
[2:08:29] god bless you friends let's all stand
[2:08:35] i just want to encourage you in the lord
[2:08:38] don't resist this truth
[2:08:41] even while i preach i can feel
[2:08:42] resistance
[2:08:44] some people are afraid to go that far
[2:08:47] but the prophet went that far
[2:08:50] this is not what i said this is what the
[2:08:52] prophet said i tried to read as much as
[2:08:54] i could read so you could see what the
[2:08:56] prophet himself taught us and and you
[2:08:58] can say but i just don't see it you
[2:08:59] don't see it because you haven't yet
[2:09:01] surrendered to it because you haven't
[2:09:02] went into it you still are hesitant
[2:09:05] because you don't want to be a fanatic
[2:09:06] you don't want to go too far you don't
[2:09:08] want to you don't want to move and find
[2:09:10] out you're wrong so you're staying on
[2:09:12] the fence and just touching the foot in
[2:09:14] the water and you'll never catch the
[2:09:15] revelation it'll always be a confusion
[2:09:18] until you say there's something in me
[2:09:20] pulling me there's something true and i
[2:09:22] am going to abandon myself and stop
[2:09:25] protecting myself and i'm going to enter
[2:09:27] into this word that has been restored to
[2:09:29] this prophet and let that word protect
[2:09:31] me
[2:09:34] amen because you we're never going to
[2:09:36] get anywhere until we say that man of
[2:09:39] god is a prophet of god he either is or
[2:09:41] he isn't there is no halfway in this
[2:09:43] friends
[2:09:44] there is no finding where he's right and
[2:09:46] finding where he's wrong and trying by
[2:09:47] our own understanding to navigate where
[2:09:49] he's right and where he's wrong and
[2:09:50] where he's too far and listen you're
[2:09:53] never going to go anywhere amen you're
[2:09:55] going to be 10 years from now exactly
[2:09:57] where you are right now with that
[2:09:58] mentality or you may be worse off
[2:10:03] you may be a total infidel disbelieving
[2:10:05] christ
[2:10:07] but how does she become the bride
[2:10:10] by letting the bride by letting the word
[2:10:12] by believing the word
[2:10:15] the church is becoming the bride by
[2:10:17] believing the word
[2:10:19] and letting it be true and confessing
[2:10:21] it's true and lining up our thinking to
[2:10:24] what god has given us in this day from
[2:10:26] the scriptures
[2:10:28] and say
[2:10:29] that is nothing but the truth
[2:10:32] and when hattie wright
[2:10:34] who had no education no spiritual
[2:10:37] training just a simple woman when she
[2:10:39] heard the prophet say something that was
[2:10:41] impossible
[2:10:43] something that had never been done in
[2:10:45] the history of mankind something
[2:10:48] happened that jesus himself didn't even
[2:10:50] do
[2:10:52] created something from nothing
[2:10:55] not even jesus christ when he broke
[2:10:57] bread he started with bread and broke
[2:10:59] more bread he started with fish and
[2:11:00] broke more fish but he never created
[2:11:02] something from nothing and here brother
[2:11:04] branham is talking to hattie wright and
[2:11:05] he's talking to her about something
[2:11:07] that's impossible for a man to do in
[2:11:09] himself and something that has never
[2:11:10] been done in the bible
[2:11:12] outside of god himself
[2:11:19] man had created but god told him what to
[2:11:21] say
[2:11:23] moses created in the bible but god said
[2:11:24] call for flies he called for flies here
[2:11:26] we have a story where he says whatever
[2:11:28] you say
[2:11:30] he's given the power of creation
[2:11:35] and that woman hears this and she
[2:11:37] doesn't say brother what scriptures are
[2:11:38] you referring to
[2:11:41] can you show me some examples in the
[2:11:42] bible
[2:11:44] that simple woman said that's nothing
[2:11:46] but the truth
[2:11:48] that's nothing but the truth and it's so
[2:11:51] pleased god it didn't please that
[2:11:53] prophet it pleased god it so pleased god
[2:11:56] that the power of god fell in that room
[2:11:58] and said give her whatever she wants
[2:12:02] the prophet of god stood up said god
[2:12:05] says whatever you want you can have and
[2:12:07] she says what should i ask what should i
[2:12:09] what should i do what and he says well
[2:12:11] your parents are poor they need money
[2:12:12] brother ben is giving her suggestions
[2:12:16] your sister's bound on a wheelchair
[2:12:19] she could be healed
[2:12:21] and she said the thing i want most
[2:12:24] look at the character of the woman
[2:12:26] is the salvation of my two boys
[2:12:30] brother ben said i give them to you in
[2:12:32] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[2:12:33] they fell over repenting
[2:12:36] what was it that pleased god so much
[2:12:38] that he would come to a humble woman
[2:12:40] that nobody in the world hardly knows
[2:12:42] that is poor and uneducated
[2:12:45] and she'll never make a big impact on
[2:12:47] the world other than the story that
[2:12:49] brother ben told
[2:12:50] but he comes to this woman he was so
[2:12:52] pleased what was he pleased with he was
[2:12:55] pleased with somebody that didn't have
[2:12:57] to be educated into believing
[2:13:00] he was pleased with somebody that could
[2:13:02] hear what god was doing and have
[2:13:04] something in her that would leap out and
[2:13:06] say that is nothing but the truth she
[2:13:09] didn't say i could see that happening
[2:13:10] that might be right she made a bold
[2:13:12] declaration that that put her on the
[2:13:15] line she said that is nothing but the
[2:13:17] truth
[2:13:21] i want the kind of faith that pleases
[2:13:22] god like that
[2:13:24] i want to hear the prophet saying see
[2:13:26] that he's he's preaching to me out of
[2:13:28] the word he's been vindicated to give
[2:13:29] this message and when he preaches this
[2:13:31] message i want something in me that
[2:13:33] could stir up and say that's nothing but
[2:13:35] the truth not say where did you get that
[2:13:36] scripture brother branham would you show
[2:13:38] me some examples out of the bible
[2:13:41] my
[2:13:43] if we would just believe the word if
[2:13:44] there's something in us to believe it
[2:13:46] then god will show you all the
[2:13:47] scriptures and show you all the examples
[2:13:49] out of the bible
[2:13:51] [Music]
[2:13:52] we're waiting to be educated in the
[2:13:54] faith and god just wants people who
[2:13:56] believe the word
[2:13:58] and there is a wisdom and there is a
[2:14:00] knowledge in god and god has a knowledge
[2:14:02] of the word that he'll give you but he
[2:14:03] won't give it to you to educate you into
[2:14:05] believing he'll give it to those who
[2:14:07] believe
[2:14:09] when you believe and can express your
[2:14:11] faith in god god has all kinds of
[2:14:13] knowledge he can build
[2:14:15] this scripture and this scripture and
[2:14:18] this this story and this parable and all
[2:14:21] of a sudden you're like how could i not
[2:14:23] see this before
[2:14:25] it's everywhere in the word
[2:14:27] it takes respect for god and respect for
[2:14:29] his word
[2:14:30] and that respect for god and respect for
[2:14:33] his word unlocks
[2:14:35] the kingdom of god and unlocks
[2:14:37] revelation and knowledge and wisdom
[2:14:41] but if we're trying to use our mind and
[2:14:42] be educated this bible will stay sealed
[2:14:45] and it'll stay locked
[2:14:49] but i want to be as simple as how he
[2:14:51] writes
[2:14:52] when i hear the word something in me
[2:14:54] knows it's true
[2:14:57] i've heard the prophet of god say things
[2:14:59] before that my heart jumped for joy and
[2:15:01] my brain says that's no way
[2:15:04] have you ever been there
[2:15:06] but something inside has to override
[2:15:09] this
[2:15:10] and say but he's the prophet of the age
[2:15:14] and when you when something inside
[2:15:16] overrides this all of a sudden by the
[2:15:18] grace of god you'll be driving down the
[2:15:20] road or reading your bible or listen to
[2:15:22] the message and all sudden bang there it
[2:15:24] is right in the bible
[2:15:26] it was there all along amen but if i
[2:15:28] would have used my mind i would have
[2:15:29] rejected the truth
[2:15:33] i said god
[2:15:35] let there be something in me rise up
[2:15:37] that can accept this word by faith and a
[2:15:39] prophet of god says that this bride is
[2:15:41] in his very image that jesus christ and
[2:15:44] the bride of christ are becoming the
[2:15:46] same flesh i want to say that's nothing
[2:15:49] but the truth
[2:15:51] let it be true in this flesh here
[2:15:53] lord let that same spirit that raised
[2:15:55] you from the dead dwelling me and keep
[2:15:57] quickening this mortal body
[2:15:59] to match that word
[2:16:01] we must surrender to the word in order
[2:16:03] to have the life of the word
[2:16:05] and without the life of the word we'll
[2:16:07] never produce the life of christ but we
[2:16:09] must surrender to the word to receive
[2:16:11] the life of the word and then the life
[2:16:13] of the word will live the word
[2:16:16] praise god let's bow our hands
[2:16:19] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[2:16:22] oh god we may be may we have a faith
[2:16:25] that pleases you lord
[2:16:28] may we believe you lord in all of your
[2:16:29] power
[2:16:31] and all of your majesty
[2:16:33] may we believe lord what you've taught
[2:16:35] us through the prophet of the age
[2:16:38] for you wasted no effort in vindicating
[2:16:40] this man
[2:16:42] you stopped at nothing you you so backed
[2:16:45] up his word and vindicated him so many
[2:16:48] times
[2:16:49] through supernatural lord that we cannot
[2:16:52] deny that you have vindicated that you
[2:16:54] yourself have put your seal of approval
[2:16:57] on this prophet
[2:16:58] help us to believe what you've taught us
[2:17:00] through that prophet
[2:17:02] god show us your word and let us walk in
[2:17:05] that word
[2:17:06] give us a heart to believe a heart to
[2:17:08] receive all that you have for us
[2:17:11] and unlock our understanding that we
[2:17:14] might understand the scriptures
[2:17:17] open our eyes of understanding
[2:17:19] help us to not stay locked in in
[2:17:22] three-dimensional thinking not stay
[2:17:24] locked
[2:17:25] into the natural realm
[2:17:27] but unlock us lord that we might see the
[2:17:30] truth and reality of your word in this
[2:17:32] day
[2:17:33] god we receive it as truth we believe
[2:17:35] it's the truth
[2:17:36] we want to walk and we even accept that
[2:17:38] it's us lord
[2:17:40] that by faith it's us
[2:17:42] it's me as an individual that you've
[2:17:44] called that this revelation is to one
[2:17:46] person to the individual and this
[2:17:49] revelation has come to me as an
[2:17:50] individual and i accept it now in the
[2:17:52] name of jesus christ that i am what i am
[2:17:55] by your grace lord
[2:17:58] god i pray that you would unlock to me
[2:17:59] understanding
[2:18:01] unlock to me the power of your word and
[2:18:03] your spirit that you can come down and
[2:18:05] live that life through me that you've
[2:18:06] ordained for this day for without you i
[2:18:09] can do nothing lord
[2:18:11] but with you all things are possible
[2:18:14] let each one of us have faith
[2:18:17] in what you've called us in what you've
[2:18:18] told us that we are
[2:18:20] and may we surrender lord to that with
[2:18:22] all of our hearts and give you
[2:18:24] preeminence and let you live through us
[2:18:26] and may you manifest through us to this
[2:18:29] world
[2:18:30] who you are
[2:18:31] in this age
[2:18:33] and god may others see the light
[2:18:35] and come to the light
[2:18:37] god we want to manifest your word
[2:18:39] because we love you
[2:18:41] but we want to manifest your word
[2:18:42] because we want to see souls saved
[2:18:45] and once the others lord come to the
[2:18:46] light lord may you shine a bright light
[2:18:48] through each of us that others may see
[2:18:50] and find their way to the same source
[2:18:52] that we found
[2:18:54] may they come to you lord and be forever
[2:18:56] changed and become part of that body
[2:18:58] that is manifesting your life
