[0:00] That eagle all his life would bump
[0:03] against the chicken wire fence and that
[0:05] was as far as he could go. All of his
[0:08] life, however long it was, his entire
[0:11] life, he would walk and he would hit the
[0:13] north side, the east side, the west
[0:15] side, and no matter what he tried,
[0:17] there's no getting through
[0:20] it. But one
[0:22] day in a moment of time, a heavenly
[0:26] scream changed everything.
[0:30] Amen. It doesn't matter how long you've
[0:32] bumped against the chicken
[0:33] wire. You can have a damaged
[0:36] relationship with a family member and
[0:39] you hit the chicken wire. Listen, all it
[0:41] takes is a scream from heaven. One
[0:43] moment can change everything. Amen. You
[0:45] can have difficulty in your marriage and
[0:47] you think it's been this way 25 years,
[0:49] 30 years, it'll always be that. It won't
[0:51] always be that way. There's no such
[0:53] thing as a dead-end road. Amen. a
[0:55] difficulty with a relationship with your
[0:57] child, with a spouse, with somebody
[0:58] else, don't ever don't ever don't ever
[1:02] give up hope. Amen. Don't ever stop
[1:05] believing. Because listen, if you're in
[1:08] a marriage that's hit a dead end and
[1:10] going nowhere, if you don't believe, who
[1:13] will? Amen.
[1:16] If you've got a relationship with a
[1:17] child that's broken and they and it
[1:19] needs to be restored and they need to
[1:21] come to the Lord, if you quit believing,
[1:23] who's going to believe? God needs
[1:25] somebody to believe his word. God needs
[1:28] somebody to have faith that it's not
[1:30] impossible. That it's not over. That the
[1:32] story's not finished yet. There's no
[1:34] period at the end of this.
[1:38] All this is is chicken wire.
[1:41] That's right. Amen. It only has me bound
[1:45] because there's things I don't yet
[1:46] understand. It's only a barrier because
[1:49] I haven't yet heard the scream that gets
[1:51] me over
[1:53] it. But it's not a limit to God. It's
[1:57] only a temporary limit to
[1:59] me. It won't last. It won't
[2:03] stand. Remember, whatever situation you
[2:05] find yourself in, if you stop
[2:08] believing, how will deliverance come? If
[2:12] you give up, you're the one in the
[2:15] situation. You're the one who has to
[2:19] believe. Don't let a little chicken wire
[2:22] cause you to lose heart. It's just a
[2:24] hop, skip, and a jump at the right time.
[2:27] And that chicken wire is no barrier at
[2:30] all. We got to stop making things big.
[2:34] They're not
[2:35] big. We got to stop making problems
[2:37] insurmountable. We have to stop making
[2:39] things, you know,
[2:41] colossal. You're only thinking that way
[2:44] because we're thinking from an earthly
[2:47] perspective. But from a heavenly
[2:49] perspective, it's not colossal. It's
[2:51] tiny.
[2:53] The problem that's big to you is tiny to
[2:56] your partner.
[2:58] And the part that you need supernatural
[3:00] deliverance for, for God, it's not
[3:02] supernatural. It's just normal. Amen.
[3:04] Cuz God's not supernatural. What we call
[3:06] supernatural is God's everyday life.
[3:08] Amen. To supernatural to him is normal.
[3:12] Yeah. So if you need supernatural, well,
[3:14] praise God to our partner. That's
[3:16] normal. Yeah. Amen. So don't give up.
[3:20] Don't stop believing. Don't
[3:23] quit because God will remove every
[3:26] barrier. Whether it's a red sea, a piece
[3:28] of chicken wire, or whatever it
[3:31] is, God has the solution. Keep
[3:35] believing, keep moving, keep pressing,
[3:38] keep doing all that you can do and then
[3:42] believe your partner to do the part you
[3:44] can do.
