[9:08] went down to the

[19:36] standing if we can take our Bibles and
[19:38] turn to Exodus chapter 3 just want to
[19:41] say God bless you it's good to have
[19:43] Brother Kyle back from Oregon amen and
[19:46] Trust all went well there and also I
[19:48] just got a picture from Vitali just
[19:50] about an hour ago they're back home they
[19:52] made it so appreciate you praying for
[19:54] them and we sure had a good time with
[19:55] them we're thankful that they were here
[19:58] also as you can tell it's a little warm
[20:00] in the sanctuary we had uh uh AP came
[20:03] out and changed our Transformer out
[20:05] yesterday and when they brought the
[20:07] power back on something's wrong with the
[20:09] air conditioners I don't know what it is
[20:11] amen so I think God just answered my
[20:13] wife's prayers because she's always cold
[20:14] in church
[20:16] so so I don't know if that was it or not
[20:18] but we need to start praying that it
[20:19] works amen but anyways we'll get that
[20:22] taken care of so the the deacons have
[20:24] opened the back doors and open the
[20:25] outside doors so we can try to get a
[20:27] little air in amen so if you go out or
[20:30] you take your children out just remember
[20:32] that all the doors are open amen so try
[20:34] to keep the noise down also we have a
[20:37] few visitors I want to welcome back
[20:40] after several years of brother Michael
[20:41] and Sister Mary and quinland from
[20:43] England God bless you it's good to have
[20:45] you here they were with us about four
[20:47] years ago and they intended to come
[20:49] right back then a nasty little thing
[20:51] called Co happened and changed
[20:53] everybody's plan so it's been four years
[20:55] so they'll be with us for about a month
[20:56] and so uh I encourage you to get to know
[20:59] them greet them they're staying with
[21:00] sister Joyce and so we'll have a good
[21:03] time with them also there's a family
[21:05] visiting from India God bless you
[21:07] they're here Sunday it's good to have
[21:08] you back they're here visiting their
[21:10] daughter but it's nice they've been
[21:12] streaming and they know who we are now
[21:14] we get a chance to see who they are God
[21:15] bless you and welcome amen let's stand
[21:19] while we're standing let's go ahead and
[21:20] read this scripture Exodus chapter 3 and
[21:23] I'm going to begin with verse
[21:27] one says now Moses kept the flock of
[21:30] Jethro his father-in-law the priest of
[21:32] Midian and he led the flock to the
[21:34] backside of the desert and came to the
[21:36] Mountain of God even to Horeb and the
[21:38] angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
[21:40] flame of fire out of the midst of a bush
[21:43] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[21:44] with fire and the Bush was not consumed
[21:47] and Moses said I will now turn aside and
[21:50] see this great sight why the bush is not
[21:53] burnt and when the Lord saw that he
[21:55] turned aside to see God called him to
[21:58] him out of the midst of the Bush and
[22:00] said Moses Moses and he said here am I
[22:03] and he said draw not nigh hither put off
[22:06] thy shoes from off thy feet for the
[22:07] place whereon thou standest is Holy
[22:09] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[22:12] thy father the god of Abraham the god of
[22:15] Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his
[22:18] face for he was afraid to look upon God
[22:21] Amen God bless you as you take your
[22:23] seats and may the Lord bless us as we
[22:25] read his word amen I've got a PowerPoint
[22:28] if we could bring up the PowerPoint uh
[22:31] brother Franco I want to minister on a
[22:33] subject called face to face and this is
[22:36] something that uh through meditation
[22:37] that's just opened up I don't know how
[22:39] or when the inspiration hit but it's
[22:41] been a little while now that I've been
[22:43] looking at this and I pray that God will
[22:45] give me the the ability to just rest and
[22:48] let him Minister as the inspiration come
[22:51] I always feel so guilty because the
[22:53] inspiration is always so good but the
[22:55] delivery is always so poor when you
[22:57] compare the two because God does
[22:59] something so deep inside of you when you
[23:01] try to put it in the language it just
[23:03] fails so we're not depending on language
[23:05] we're depending on the Holy Ghost Amen
[23:07] to come and be the Divine interpreter of
[23:09] his word and so I put together a
[23:11] PowerPoint because I want to lay a
[23:13] foundation in the scriptures and I want
[23:14] to go through a lot of scriptures so
[23:16] this helps me move more quickly than
[23:18] turning back and forth so you can jot
[23:20] down the scriptures as we go and I I'm
[23:22] not going to try to cram all this in I'm
[23:24] going to try to discipline myself and I
[23:26] don't want to go long been trying on
[23:28] Wednesdays not to go long I've been
[23:30] trying to be about an hour and I've been
[23:32] failing thus far but I've been trying
[23:35] and I intend to do that because I know
[23:37] everybody works we got to get up early
[23:38] school's back in session there's things
[23:41] that we are commissioned to do amen and
[23:43] it's also part of the plan of God that
[23:45] we work and go to school so we want to
[23:47] we want to be sensitive to that as well
[23:49] so you just pray for me that God will
[23:51] help me and so we can be concise but I'm
[23:54] going to lay a foundation I'm not going
[23:55] to cram it all in if we have to extend
[23:57] extend it to Sunday we'll just pick it
[23:59] up on Sunday Lord willing so we see now
[24:02] we know this passage really well here in
[24:05] the uh Book of Exodus when Moses is now
[24:08] out in the desert he's run from Egypt
[24:11] and and we know he's born to be a
[24:13] deliverer predestinated to be that
[24:15] deliverer and and now he's out in Egypt
[24:18] and God's going to get his attention and
[24:20] he sees a a bush that's consumed with
[24:23] fire or it's full of flame but not being
[24:25] consumed by the fire and God called his
[24:28] attention and he drew aside to see and
[24:30] we know that this is the pillar of fire
[24:32] it's the angel of the Lord that's in the
[24:34] bush and and he begins to draw nigh and
[24:38] God in verse four says when the Lord saw
[24:40] that he turned aside to see God called
[24:42] unto him out of the midst of the Bush
[24:45] and said Moses Moses said here am I so
[24:48] now we know that the Lord is there we
[24:50] know it's the angel of the Lord but we
[24:51] know it's God we always we have to ask
[24:54] ourselves is it God or is it the angel
[24:55] of the Lord amen these are such such
[24:58] good questions we're going to ask as we
[25:00] move on and you'll find out why I'm
[25:01] doing that I'm not trying to bring any
[25:03] confusion but I want us to think deeper
[25:05] on these things because so many times we
[25:08] skim over things and we don't take the
[25:10] full depth of meaning and brother
[25:12] bandham said God condenses his truths in
[25:14] the Bible and he wants us to meditate on
[25:16] these things because God he he he takes
[25:19] his full Revelation and he and he
[25:21] compacts it into one
[25:23] book and then by then by the ministry of
[25:26] the word by the gift of a prophet by the
[25:28] five-fold ministry and the gift of the
[25:29] Holy Ghost and Revelation from God he
[25:31] begins to take that book and expand it
[25:33] into all kinds of
[25:36] places so we see now God begins to speak
[25:39] to him out of this bush we know there's
[25:41] a light in the Bush Moses knows it as a
[25:43] fire and and it's the pillar of fire in
[25:47] verse six he says moreover he said I am
[25:49] the god of thy father the god of Abraham
[25:51] the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and
[25:53] Moses hid his face for he was afraid to
[25:56] look upon God he knew there was God God
[25:58] was calling and saying I God I'm the god
[26:01] of thy fathers and Moses was afraid to
[26:04] see God now we're going to we're going
[26:07] to keep going here let's go over to
[26:09] Exodus chapter
[26:12] 33 no yeah turn to Exodus 33 and then
[26:15] I'm going to read this
[26:18] scripture out of Deuteronomy 34:9 I have
[26:22] it on the overhead here it says and
[26:23] Joshua the son of nun was full of the
[26:25] spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his
[26:27] hand upon him and the children of Israel
[26:29] hearkened unto him and did as the Lord
[26:30] commanded Moses and there arose not a
[26:33] prophet since in Israel like unto Moses
[26:36] whom the Lord knew face to face here God
[26:40] begins to speak to Moses and it's God
[26:42] himself speaking to Moses out of this
[26:44] bush amen and and Moses when he knew
[26:48] that was God speaking to him hid his
[26:49] face CU he was afraid to see God but now
[26:52] it says there was no prophet in Israel
[26:55] since in Israel like un Moses who whom
[26:57] the Lord knew face to face this is where
[27:00] I get my subject face to face and I want
[27:03] to know I I was questioning what does it
[27:06] mean to know face to face what does that
[27:08] term actually mean I want to know what
[27:10] it means I don't want to just use a term
[27:12] but I want to know what it means and so
[27:14] let's look now in Exodus
[27:18] 33:9 in Exodus 33:9 it says and it came
[27:22] to pass as Moses entered into the
[27:24] Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended
[27:27] and stood at the door of the Tabernacle
[27:28] and the people and the Lord talked with
[27:31] Moses so he went and God called him to
[27:33] the Tabernacle he went into the
[27:35] Tabernacle and the Lord began to talk to
[27:38] Moses in the Tabernacle and all the
[27:40] people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at
[27:42] the Tabernacle door and all the people
[27:44] rose up and worshiped every man in his
[27:46] tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses
[27:49] face to face as a man speaketh unto his
[27:52] friend and he turned again into the camp
[27:55] so I want to stop there I don't want to
[27:57] read any further but the Lord spake unto
[27:59] Moses face to face as a man speaketh to
[28:02] his friend that's an amazing
[28:05] relationship is an amazing relationship
[28:07] and now we know we're starting to see
[28:09] what this face to face means he speaks
[28:11] to Moses face to face as a man speaketh
[28:14] to his
[28:15] friend this isn't like a god G giving
[28:19] down decrees this is like a man
[28:20] conversing with his friend and now he's
[28:23] talking to him face to
[28:25] face and and so I this is Exodus 33 is
[28:31] the chapter that first formed this
[28:33] question for me what does it mean face
[28:35] to face cuz I thought I knew what it
[28:37] meant until I got a little deeper into
[28:39] this chapter so this is just what we
[28:42] just read the portion we just read and
[28:44] the Lord spake to Moses face to face
[28:46] this is the term I want to look at as a
[28:48] man speaketh to his friend but when we
[28:50] get a little further down just a short
[28:52] ways I'm sorry I I'm going to give you
[28:54] the definition of face to face this word
[28:56] face means face just like we would
[28:59] indicate face but it also means presence
[29:01] or
[29:02] person this is really important because
[29:06] because it could mean your literal face
[29:09] but it doesn't always mean your literal
[29:11] face it could mean your presence it
[29:14] could represent your
[29:16] person so let's look further down we
[29:19] stopped reading at 11 but now in verse
[29:20] 18 it says and he said I beseech thee
[29:23] show me thy glory and he said I will
[29:25] make all my goodness pass before thee
[29:27] and I will proclaim the name of the Lord
[29:29] before thee and I will be gracious to
[29:30] whom I will be gracious and I will show
[29:32] Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he
[29:34] said thou can't not see my face for
[29:37] there shall no man see me and live this
[29:40] is where I first asked the question what
[29:43] does it mean when he said he talked to
[29:45] him face to face because just just seven
[29:48] verses later or uh not seven but just uh
[29:53] 10 nine verses later he says no man can
[29:56] see my face in live but yet he met him
[30:00] face to face he spoke to him face to
[30:02] face there was no Prophet like Moses
[30:03] since who the Lord spoke to face to face
[30:06] but here he says Thou cast not see Moses
[30:08] said show me my glory and he says no man
[30:10] can see my face for there shall no man
[30:13] see me and live and the Lord said behold
[30:16] there is a place by me and thou shalt
[30:17] stand upon a rock and it shall come to
[30:20] pass while my glory passes by that I
[30:22] will put thee in a CLE Cliff of The Rock
[30:25] and will cover thee with my hand while I
[30:27] pass by and I will take away mine hand
[30:30] and thou shalt see my back Parts but my
[30:33] face shall not be
[30:35] seen this is this is true throughout the
[30:38] scriptures that no man can see God and
[30:41] live and no man can see God's face so
[30:44] when Moses was talking God to God face
[30:46] to face amen it's not as though Moses
[30:49] could have described to you the shape of
[30:50] God's face uh did God have a nose did
[30:53] God what size were his ears amen because
[30:56] God is a spe Spirit God is
[30:58] invisible God can take on all kinds of
[31:01] forms to to show himself and to declare
[31:03] himself and become visible but God
[31:05] himself is the invisible God is that
[31:08] right so when Moses talks to God face to
[31:10] face amen now it's not as though Moses
[31:13] is seeing a face it means that Moses is
[31:17] personto person with God God is speaking
[31:20] to him on a personal level as a person
[31:22] speaking to a person as a man speaks to
[31:24] his friend because God says you cannot
[31:27] see my face and live and when I read
[31:29] this I'm thinking I've had this picture
[31:31] all
[31:32] wrong I I imagine Moses standing before
[31:36] God and God but then all of a sudden I
[31:38] got to this portion of scripture I said
[31:40] it's not what I think it is amen because
[31:43] God Moses may not have seen anything
[31:46] right he saw a pillar of fire amen and
[31:49] God was speaking to him out of a pillar
[31:50] of fire amen who I don't know exactly
[31:53] what Moses would have seen or how God
[31:55] how many different ways God would have
[31:56] represented presented himself to Moses
[31:58] but God said you can't see my
[32:01] face is that right so when he was
[32:04] talking to Moses it was something
[32:06] different than when I say I'm looking at
[32:09] your face when he was face to face with
[32:11] God God was facing off with Moses in a
[32:15] personal relationship and he was coming
[32:17] to him person to person so maybe we
[32:21] could take this as a as a as just a a
[32:23] cheap definition maybe just the some way
[32:25] of explaining it and instead of face to
[32:27] face we could understand person to
[32:29] person God spoke to Moses person to
[32:32] person the way a man speaks to his
[32:35] friend it says in numbers 789 and when
[32:38] Moses was gone into the Tabernacle of
[32:42] the congregation to speak with him then
[32:44] he heard the voice of one speaking to
[32:46] him from off the mercy seat that was
[32:49] upon the Ark of testimony from between
[32:51] the two cherubims and he spake unto him
[32:54] now when we first went to Exodus 33 at
[32:58] the beginning of Exodus 33 when we were
[33:00] here let's go let's let's look it should
[33:02] still be open in your
[33:10] Bibles verse 8 and it came to pass when
[33:13] Moses went out into the Tabernacle that
[33:15] all the people rose up and stood every
[33:16] man at his tent door and looked after
[33:18] Moses until he'd gone into the
[33:19] Tabernacle so he's going into the
[33:21] Tabernacle and it came to pass as Moses
[33:24] entered the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar
[33:26] descended and stood at the door of the
[33:28] Tabernacle now verse 11 and the Lord
[33:31] spake unto Moses face to face as a man
[33:33] speaketh unto his friend but here in
[33:36] number seven it gives a different
[33:38] description in number seven it says when
[33:40] Moses was gone into the Tabernacle of
[33:42] the congregation to speak with him then
[33:45] he heard the voice of one Speaking unto
[33:47] him from off The Mercy Seat God was on
[33:50] The Mercy Seat between the wings of the
[33:51] cheram because that's where his throne
[33:53] was that's where he said he would abide
[33:55] amen and there was a veil over that I
[33:57] don't know if Moses went behind the veil
[33:59] or not I'm not sure but God was there
[34:01] between the wings of the cheram and
[34:03] Moses heard his voice from off The Mercy
[34:06] Seat so God was speaking to him from The
[34:08] Mercy Seat and and and God describes
[34:11] this as talking to Moses face to face
[34:16] amen then in Genesis 32 we're going to
[34:19] go to the story of Jacob now Jacob when
[34:22] he's coming back from laan his father
[34:23] he's entering into the promised land I'm
[34:25] jumping from one story to the next but I
[34:27] want to use these examples and Jacob was
[34:29] left alone and there Wrestled a man with
[34:32] him until the breaking of day and so in
[34:35] Genesis 32 he comes and he goes over uh
[34:38] uh the brook and he leaves his family on
[34:40] one side and he meets a man and he
[34:42] wrestles with that man and we know later
[34:44] that he's going to call that man God but
[34:47] here he wrestles with a man but in Hosea
[34:50] Hosea calls this man an
[34:52] angel says he took his brother by the
[34:54] heel in the womb and by his strength he
[34:56] had power with with God yeah he had
[34:58] power over the angel and prevailed so
[35:01] now depending on where you're on the
[35:03] scripture it's either a man or it's an
[35:05] angel amen it's God in a form amen it's
[35:09] a man or an angel come to speak to him
[35:12] and this is what Genesis 32:30 says and
[35:15] Jacob called the name of the place
[35:16] pineal for I have seen God face to face
[35:20] and my life is
[35:21] preserved Jacob says I have seen God and
[35:24] the Bible says he wrestled with a man
[35:26] and joah said he prevailed over the
[35:28] angel amen but but but Jacob said I have
[35:32] seen God face to face but God said no
[35:35] man can see my face I hope we're seeing
[35:39] the picture now God said nobody can see
[35:41] me and live no man can see my face even
[35:44] Moses who was his friend who he spoke to
[35:46] amen fa face to face he put his hand
[35:49] over him put him in the Cliff of the
[35:50] rock put his hand over him until he
[35:52] passed by and removed his hand to let
[35:53] him see the back part of him but
[35:55] wouldn't let him see his face yet Jacob
[35:57] said I saw him face to face what did
[35:59] Jacob see it was God in a form speaking
[36:02] back to him and he had interaction with
[36:05] him and he said I saw God face to face
[36:08] the thing is was it correct yes was it
[36:10] correct
[36:13] no it was correct amen he saw God face
[36:17] to face but it was not the the face of
[36:19] God that no man can see lest they die it
[36:21] was God representing himself as an angel
[36:24] who looked like a man who could wrestle
[36:26] with Jacob
[36:29] we got
[36:31] that John 1:18 it says no man has seen
[36:34] God at any time but I thought Jacob said
[36:37] he saw
[36:38] him is that right Jacob said I got I saw
[36:42] God face to
[36:44] face but John 1:18 says no man has seen
[36:47] God at any
[36:50] time and we know there's no discrepancy
[36:52] in the
[36:55] Bible there's no no discrepancy in the
[36:58] Bible God said no man can see my face in
[37:02] the Book of John it says no man has seen
[37:04] God at any
[37:06] time when
[37:08] Moses when Moses met the pillar of fire
[37:11] that was God in a form speaking back to
[37:14] him was it God it was God it was the
[37:18] invisible God who took on a form and in
[37:21] that form he spoke to Moses and Moses
[37:23] was so fearful he wouldn't even look up
[37:26] he hit his eyes so that he wouldn't see
[37:28] God but then later God says you can't
[37:30] see
[37:32] me it says no man has seen God at any
[37:36] time the only begotten son which is in
[37:38] the bosom of the father he hath declared
[37:41] him what was it was God in a
[37:44] form in 1 Timothy 6:16 it says who only
[37:48] hath immortality dwelling in the light
[37:50] which no man can approach unto whom no
[37:52] man hath seen nor can see to whom be
[37:55] honor and power Everlasting amen amen no
[38:00] man has seen God at any time do we
[38:02] believe that's
[38:03] true but we also believe that God spoke
[38:06] to Moses face to face we let us true
[38:08] right but God said no no you Moses you
[38:11] can't see my face amen no man can see my
[38:13] face and live but yet Jacob said I saw
[38:15] God face to face we believe both of
[38:17] those are true right so that means you
[38:19] can meet God face to face amen and it
[38:22] could be a different form and what Jacob
[38:25] saw could be different than what Moses
[38:27] saw is that right but they still both
[38:30] met God face to face we believe that's
[38:33] true amen I mean see we sometimes we
[38:37] have to move beyond what we understand
[38:39] in the carnal world because the spirit
[38:41] world does not work like the carnal
[38:43] World we're so used to time matter and
[38:45] space I've said this before and so
[38:47] limited by our language and our language
[38:49] is developed to explain the world we
[38:50] live in and explain the bodies we live
[38:53] in and all of our language is here to
[38:55] explain this dimension that's right and
[38:57] we don't have enough language to explain
[38:59] the other dimension that's why we're
[39:00] always fumbling around trying to explain
[39:02] it and trying to find the right words
[39:04] cuz there's not right words in the
[39:05] language to explain that Dimension but
[39:08] God is constantly coming down and
[39:10] expressing himself in this Dimension
[39:12] amen and whenever he expresses himself
[39:14] amen all of a sudden we now find that
[39:17] that was an expression of God there's
[39:19] God and we grab a hold of that and that
[39:21] that's it that's God and only this can
[39:24] ever be God and just as soon as we do
[39:26] that God changes forms and comes another
[39:28] way and all of a sudden when we when we
[39:30] when we zero down on this now we refuse
[39:32] to say this is
[39:34] God I saw him here but that's not him no
[39:37] you saw him here you should see him here
[39:40] and when he moves to another you should
[39:41] see him
[39:42] here because that's God amen amen he's
[39:45] injecting himself into this Dimension
[39:47] but he is not bound by this Dimension
[39:49] he's not limited by this Dimension he
[39:51] exists outside of this Dimension and he
[39:54] injects himself into this dimension but
[39:56] he exists outside this
[39:59] Dimension praise
[40:02] God
[40:04] Amen and the unchangeable god brother B
[40:06] says and then Jacob all Disturbed and
[40:09] perplexed and in trouble set his wives
[40:11] across the Little Brook went back on the
[40:13] other side in an unexpected place and in
[40:15] an unexpected time he met God in an
[40:17] unexpected way what a way to meet God in
[40:21] a wrestling match but it was God
[40:24] regardless of whether he's in a burning
[40:25] bush or wrestling match it was
[40:29] God praise
[40:31] God so if it was God in a wrestling
[40:37] match then how could it be God in a
[40:39] burning
[40:42] bush because Moses couldn't wrestle with
[40:44] the bush wasn't in the form of a man God
[40:49] was in another form but it was the same
[40:51] God it was the same God who spoke to
[40:53] Jacob and blessed Jacob it was the same
[40:55] God who spoke to to Moses and instructed
[40:57] Moses it was God it was God but then
[41:01] when you think about it it was God but
[41:04] it wasn't God right it was God but the
[41:09] bush wasn't God it was a bush the pillar
[41:13] of fire is a way that God represents
[41:15] himself but God existed before the
[41:17] pillar of fire god was real before there
[41:20] was anything that declared him before
[41:22] there was even anything visible there
[41:24] was God so God exist beyond anything
[41:28] visible but he uses things visible and
[41:31] things tangible to begin to express
[41:32] himself and when God takes that form and
[41:34] expresses it that's God Amen because
[41:36] God's in it God's using it that makes it
[41:39] God but God can jump out of that into
[41:41] something else and now this is
[41:44] God so now we could find the bush you
[41:46] know maybe it's still living that that
[41:48] Moses that the pillar of fire entered
[41:50] into amen and we could go back and
[41:52] worship the bush but that's not going to
[41:53] do any good God was using that temporal
[41:57] where you know where is that man that
[42:00] angel that Jacob wrestled with amen that
[42:02] form amen the the forms even that God
[42:05] took on when God stepped down as Elohim
[42:08] took on flesh to come and speak to
[42:10] Abraham amen then brother brandham said
[42:13] he just grabbed the elements he blew it
[42:14] off of his hands they formed a body he
[42:16] stepped into it and that was God is that
[42:20] right that was God speaking to Mo God
[42:23] met Moses flesh to flesh amen but but
[42:27] yet when he was done those elements just
[42:29] went back to elements and disappeared
[42:31] and he went back to being the invisible
[42:35] God so was it God yes was it
[42:42] God see what I'm saying this is where
[42:45] language is so pathetic this is where
[42:48] human understanding is so
[42:51] foolish because we get hung up on was it
[42:54] or wasn't it it was this and then it was
[42:56] that how can it be this and that it can
[42:59] be this that that that and
[43:02] that and still all be
[43:05] God I I wish I had a better way explain
[43:07] that's the best I can
[43:10] do amen so brother bam said whether it
[43:14] was in a wrestling match or in a burning
[43:17] bush it was God regardless of whether it
[43:20] was in a burning bush or a wrestling
[43:21] match it was God I believe it amen
[43:24] praise God and God's provided approach
[43:28] he says God loves to fellowship with his
[43:30] creature in the Garden of Eden we are
[43:32] told that when man walked in and
[43:34] uprightness of God God come down in the
[43:36] cool of the evening and fellowshipped
[43:38] with his children amen so we believe
[43:40] this brother bham even dramatizes that
[43:42] God comes down in the cool of the
[43:43] evening to walk with his children in the
[43:45] cool of the evening and even says
[43:47] children have you enjoyed your day today
[43:49] did you enjoy my creation and brother B
[43:52] dramatizes all of this Force so we can
[43:54] see it amen and so I believe with all my
[43:56] heart God came down and fellowshipped
[43:58] with his children in the cool of the
[44:01] evening but when Adam had fallen and God
[44:04] came down in the cool of the evening for
[44:05] his daily Fellowship this is what it
[44:07] says in Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of them
[44:10] both were open and they knew that they
[44:12] were naked and they sewed fig leaves
[44:14] together and made themselves aprons and
[44:16] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[44:18] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[44:21] day they didn't hear
[44:23] footsteps it never says they saw a form
[44:27] but they heard the voice of the Lord God
[44:30] walking in the garden what did Moses
[44:32] hear he heard God Amen what did he hear
[44:35] in the Tabernacle between the wings of
[44:37] the chair he heard God he met God when
[44:40] he met the voice of God what was it in
[44:43] the burning bush that declared that that
[44:44] was godone not that this is a fire not
[44:47] that it was in a bush but when out of
[44:49] the Bush and out of the fire God spoke
[44:51] amen and told him who he was then he
[44:53] knew it was
[44:54] God Amen
[44:56] amen so they heard the voice of the Lord
[44:58] God Walking In The Garden in the cool of
[45:00] the day and Adam and his wife hid
[45:02] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[45:03] God amongst the Trees of the garden and
[45:05] the Lord God called unto Adam and said
[45:07] unto him where art thou and he said I
[45:10] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[45:12] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[45:17] myself I I'm going to confess to you I
[45:21] have no idea what form or representation
[45:25] they saw
[45:27] they could have seen a myriad of
[45:29] things they could have seen the
[45:31] similitude of a man they could have seen
[45:32] an his Angelic form they could have seen
[45:35] anything the Bible doesn't tell us that
[45:38] they saw anything but they
[45:40] heard one thing sure when God came down
[45:44] they heard when the presence of God was
[45:46] in the garden they heard his voice and
[45:48] they knew he was there by his voice is
[45:52] that clear in Genesis so I don't know if
[45:54] they saw a form him or didn't see a form
[45:57] if they saw a form I mean we can use our
[45:59] imaginations all day long and still just
[46:01] be as nowhere as we are right now amen
[46:03] but the reality is they knew his
[46:06] presence by his
[46:07] voice not by his image by his voice they
[46:10] knew his presence they knew God was in
[46:12] the garden by his voice this is so
[46:16] important Moses knew God was in the
[46:18] temple amen because he spoke to him out
[46:20] of the Tabernacle he knew he was in the
[46:22] bush because he spoke to him out of the
[46:23] midst of the fire amen and he gave him
[46:26] the
[46:27] word praise
[46:29] God remember when brother Brandon is on
[46:32] a mountain in Colorado and he's
[46:34] hunting and the storm comes and he knows
[46:36] it sudden death and the voice of the
[46:38] Lord tells him to go back into the storm
[46:39] and he goes back into the storm and he
[46:41] speaks through the storm and the storm
[46:43] Fades away and and all of a sudden the
[46:45] Sun comes out and brother B starts
[46:47] walking he's walking through Virgin
[46:48] Timber he a as a as a hybrid born uh
[46:52] redeemed Son of God has just spoken to
[46:55] Nature
[46:56] the same way Adam did the same way Jesus
[46:59] Christ did he just spoke to Nature and a
[47:00] nature obeyed his voice now he's work
[47:03] walking through Virgin Timber amen it's
[47:05] like he's going back into an Eden
[47:07] condition showing that all that Adam
[47:08] lost is being restored amen back into
[47:11] the hands of even Fallen redeemed man
[47:13] and so now he's walking amen he sees an
[47:16] image before him he sees his wife and
[47:18] but he sees his wife young not
[47:20] old he says then I looked at my hands
[47:23] and in every way he said my thoughts and
[47:25] everything I turned back young
[47:28] again he's coming to a needing condition
[47:31] but then what does God say to him he
[47:33] says why don't you walk with me amen why
[47:37] don't you walk with me God wanted to
[47:40] walk with the prophet just like he did
[47:42] in Eden everything that was lost in Eden
[47:45] was coming back in this snapshot so that
[47:47] we could see it and fellowship between
[47:49] God and man come back and he said why
[47:51] don't you walk with me he said oh I
[47:53] would love
[47:54] to
[47:56] and he went walking through that virgin
[47:58] Timber the animals wouldn't leave him
[48:00] they kept coming to him in every way it
[48:02] was like the restoration of Eden just
[48:04] for a brief moment of time so that we
[48:06] could see it that's my faith and my
[48:08] belief that we could see it amen
[48:10] demonstrated so we know the title deed
[48:12] book has been given back
[48:14] amen but then so so if everything was
[48:17] restored his youth was restored his wife
[48:19] was restored in virgin Timber speaking
[48:22] to Nature and then all of a sudden
[48:23] fellowship with God is restored I asked
[48:25] you what did he
[48:26] see what form was he in what image did
[48:30] he see brother B never says he saw
[48:32] anything he knew him by a voice amen he
[48:35] knew him by his presence the presence of
[48:37] God came back to fellowship with him he
[48:39] didn't see as far as we know he never
[48:42] told us he saw an image he heard a
[48:47] voice praise
[48:50] God I tell you what I've heard a
[48:54] voice
[48:58] I've Heard a
[49:00] Voice let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 5
[49:10] together let's look at this example
[49:14] here Deuteronomy chapter
[49:20] 5 Moses in the book of Deuteronomy
[49:23] here he's rehearsing ing the Journey of
[49:27] The Exodus to them before he departs
[49:29] from the cross over and as he's
[49:31] rehearsing this he begins to explain
[49:34] what they've been through and the events
[49:36] that have happened and he comes to verse
[49:39] uh five here in chapter 5 verse 5 I'm
[49:41] sorry verse one I'm going to go to verse
[49:43] one first and he and he begins to
[49:46] explain to them what was happening and
[49:49] he goes back now he's going back to
[49:50] Mount Si and Moses called all Israel and
[49:53] said unto them here o Israel the St
[49:55] statutes and judgments which I speak in
[49:57] your ears this day that you may learn
[49:59] them and keep and do them and the Lord
[50:01] Our God made a covenant with us and
[50:04] horb the Lord made not this Covenant
[50:07] with our fathers but with us even us who
[50:10] are all of us here alive this day the
[50:13] Lord talked with you face to face in the
[50:16] mount out of the midst of the fire I
[50:19] stood between the Lord and you at that
[50:21] time to show you the word of the Lord
[50:22] for you were afraid by reason of the
[50:24] fire and went not up into the mount so
[50:27] here he's saying to all of Israel the
[50:30] Lord met you face to face now it's not
[50:33] just Moses in the Tabernacle of Moses at
[50:35] the bush now Moses is saying and on
[50:38] Mount Si amen when the when the mountain
[50:41] Shook and the earthquake and the pillar
[50:43] of fire came down and the cloud and
[50:45] thick Darkness was all about it he said
[50:47] then the Lord spoke to you face to
[50:51] face praise be to God I want to read
[50:53] that again verse four the Lord talked
[50:56] with you face to face in the mount out
[50:58] of the midst of fire and then there's
[51:00] parentheses parentheses uh uh I can't
[51:03] remember all the English terms but it's
[51:04] an injected thought so we can skip the
[51:06] parentheses and stay in the line of
[51:08] thought of the sentence the Lord talked
[51:10] with you face to face in the M Mount out
[51:13] of the midst of fire saying bottom verse
[51:16] 5 saying I am the Lord thy God which
[51:18] brought thee out of the land of Egypt
[51:20] from the house of bondage Thou shalt
[51:22] have no other gods before me and he goes
[51:24] from here all the way to the bottom of
[51:25] verse 21 and he speaks the Ten
[51:28] Commandments bang bang bang bang what we
[51:30] call the Ten Commandments all the way
[51:32] down and and and now Moses is saying
[51:36] when you came up to the Mount when you
[51:37] came out of Egypt amen and out of the
[51:39] midst of the fire God spoke to you face
[51:42] to face saying thou shall have no other
[51:44] gods before me amen Thou shalt not lie
[51:46] Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not
[51:48] commit adultery what was he doing he was
[51:50] giving them the word out of from inside
[51:53] the thick Darkness Inside the Fire amen
[51:56] up on the mount they heard his voice he
[51:58] was giving them the word and he says he
[52:01] was speaking to you face to
[52:04] face did they see God they saw a they
[52:07] saw Darkness they saw fire they saw
[52:09] smoke like a burning furnace they felt
[52:11] the Earth shaking they heard a voice did
[52:13] they see God yes did they see God
[52:17] no because no man can see God and live
[52:22] but they saw a form that was in
[52:24] shrouding and God was behind the form
[52:26] but what they heard was the voice of God
[52:29] speaking to them face to
[52:34] face and and no goes all the way down to
[52:37] verse 21 giving the Ten
[52:39] Commandments verse 22 these words the
[52:42] Lord spake unto all your assembly in the
[52:44] mount out of the midst of the fire of
[52:46] the cloud and of the thick Darkness with
[52:48] a great voice and he added no more and
[52:51] he wrote them in two tables of stone and
[52:53] delivered them unto me
[52:56] how did they meet God face to
[52:58] face when God gave them the
[53:02] word when they stood at the base of the
[53:04] mountain and God showed himself in Fire
[53:06] and smoke amen but inside this is what
[53:10] what Moses says here look listen I'm
[53:13] going to read it again these words the
[53:14] Lord spake unto all your assembly in the
[53:16] mouth out of the midst of fire of the
[53:18] cloud and out of the thick Darkness with
[53:21] a great voice amen he was behind it all
[53:24] speaking
[53:26] it was God speaking to them the word for
[53:28] their day giving them the Commandments
[53:30] amen the Covenant he's making with them
[53:32] and it was God speaking to them face to
[53:36] face and the great tragedy was that when
[53:39] God spoke to them that way they ran away
[53:43] they're supposed to come to him but they
[53:44] ran and stood a far off and asked Moses
[53:46] to go that was the tragedy that God
[53:48] would come speak to them face to face
[53:50] the way he spoke to his prophet and they
[53:52] would run away and send the prophet
[53:56] amen let's keep
[53:58] moving in Ezekiel 20:33 he says as I
[54:02] live sayith the Lord God surely with a
[54:03] mighty hand with a stretched out arm and
[54:06] with Fury poured out will I rule over
[54:08] you and I will bring you out from the
[54:11] people and will gather you out of the
[54:12] countries wherein you were scattered
[54:13] with a mighty hand and with a stretched
[54:15] out arm and with Fury poured out and I
[54:18] will bring you into the Wilderness of
[54:20] the people and there will I plead with
[54:22] you face to face like as I pleaded with
[54:25] your fathers in the wilderness of the
[54:27] land of Egypt so will I plead with you
[54:30] sayeth the Lord he's speaking of a
[54:33] regathering of Israel I will reather you
[54:36] I will bring you from the Wilderness I
[54:38] will bring you back amen and I will
[54:40] bring you into the Wilderness of people
[54:42] and there will I plead with you face to
[54:45] face what will they see I think more
[54:48] importantly than what they see is what
[54:50] they hear I think that's really the
[54:52] question now I think that's what we're
[54:54] finding is the important part of meeting
[54:56] God face to face is the voice
[54:59] amen Deuteronomy 4 nine says only take
[55:04] heed to thyself and keep thy Soul
[55:06] diligently lest thou forget the things
[55:09] which thine eyes have seen and lest they
[55:10] depart from thy heart all the days of
[55:12] thy life but teach them thy sons and thy
[55:15] son's Sons especially the day that thou
[55:18] stood us before the Lord thy God and
[55:20] Horeb when the Lord said unto me gather
[55:23] me the people together and I will make
[55:25] them hear my words that they may learn
[55:27] to fear me all the days that they shall
[55:29] live upon the Earth and that they may
[55:31] teach their children and ye came near
[55:34] and stood under the mountain and the
[55:36] mountain burned with fire into the midst
[55:37] of heaven with Darkness clouds and thick
[55:40] darkness and the Lord spake unto you out
[55:43] of the midst of the fire you heard the
[55:45] voice of the words but saw no similitude
[55:49] Only You Heard a Voice and he declared
[55:52] unto you his Covenant which he commanded
[55:54] you to perform form even Ten
[55:55] Commandments and he wrote them upon two
[55:57] tables of stone here's the same event
[56:00] the same thing only now he's saying you
[56:02] heard the voice of the words but saw no
[56:04] similitude this word similitude
[56:07] similitude is what it is similitude
[56:09] means form image or likeness
[56:12] representation or
[56:14] semblance you didn't see anything that
[56:16] looked like a person you didn't see
[56:19] anything amen that declared to you this
[56:21] person amen you saw the fire the smoke
[56:24] and the thick Darkness but you saw no
[56:25] similitude but Moses says later God
[56:28] spoke to you face to face face to face
[56:30] but you didn't see any
[56:32] similitude face to face is person to
[56:35] person God came down and spoke to them
[56:37] as a
[56:38] person praise
[56:41] God Hebrews chapter
[56:43] 1 God who at sunry times and in diverse
[56:48] manner spake in time pass un to the
[56:49] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[56:52] last days spoken to us by his son whom
[56:55] he ha appointed heir of All Things by
[56:57] whom also he made the worlds who being
[56:59] the brightness of his glory and the
[57:01] express image of his person we went
[57:04] through this a few weeks ago but I'm
[57:05] going to bring the definition up again
[57:07] of Express image of his person and I'm
[57:09] just going to read here the highlighted
[57:11] part the exact expression the image of
[57:15] any person or thing marked likeness
[57:18] precise reproduction in every
[57:21] respect what was Jesus Jesus was showing
[57:25] The World God yes he was God Amen what
[57:29] made him God because when God made a
[57:31] flesh body this was the only flesh body
[57:33] he made for him to dwell in fullness in
[57:36] and God the fullness of the godhead was
[57:38] bodily in Christ Jesus so he made Jesus
[57:41] a stamped replica an absolute likeness a
[57:44] a a perfect reflection of God and now he
[57:47] was there in the flesh reflecting God so
[57:51] this becomes the Flesh of God and God
[57:54] the spirit of God dwelt In the Flesh of
[57:57] God and then we could see
[58:00] God praise
[58:02] God but you know this similitude this
[58:07] exact expression image of it's more than
[58:11] just the facial
[58:13] structure it was also the character it
[58:16] was the life it was the nature it was
[58:19] everything all bundled in one Jesus
[58:21] Christ was showing God on the earth he
[58:24] was de claring God it was God showing
[58:27] himself in Jesus
[58:30] Christ in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 says
[58:34] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[58:37] them that are lost and whom the God of
[58:39] this world has blinded the minds of them
[58:41] which believe not lest the light of the
[58:43] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[58:45] image of God should shine unto them so
[58:48] now Jesus Christ Christ is the image of
[58:51] God Amen when you want to see God you
[58:53] have to see Jesus
[58:55] Christ when when when Philip I believe
[58:59] it was he said show us the father and it
[59:01] should suffice us and Jesus said have I
[59:03] been so long with you that you know me
[59:05] not when you see me you've seen the
[59:08] father amen they were standing before
[59:12] God face to face talking to God and they
[59:14] didn't even know it amen God was
[59:17] speaking through his
[59:18] son in Colossians 1:15 it says who is
[59:21] the image of the invisible God the
[59:24] firstborn of every creature so what was
[59:27] Jesus Christ he was the image of the
[59:29] invisible God when God made his likeness
[59:32] on Earth he made the Flesh of Jesus
[59:34] Christ and stepped into it he's the
[59:36] image of the invisible God now we look
[59:39] at this 2 Corinthians 46 for God who
[59:41] commanded the light to shine out of
[59:43] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[59:46] give the light of the knowledge of the
[59:47] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[59:51] so how we know about the light of the
[59:52] knowledge of the glory of God you see in
[59:54] the face of Jesus Christ he's declaring
[59:56] the
[59:57] father this word face means face or
[1:00:00] person or presence or countenance amen
[1:00:04] so in the countenance or the person of
[1:00:06] Jesus Christ you see the glory of
[1:00:08] God
[1:00:10] Amen praise God we're moving along we're
[1:00:13] making good times so don't get nervous
[1:00:15] we're going quickly and the message is
[1:00:18] shamed he says but it's it's a reality
[1:00:21] to a man or a woman boy or girl who
[1:00:22] really is a genuine Christian when God
[1:00:25] made the promise of the baptism of the
[1:00:27] Holy Ghost and you received it there is
[1:00:28] something that settles within you and
[1:00:30] there is nothing takes its place when a
[1:00:33] man ever meets God not in some emotional
[1:00:36] workup some enthusiasm or some religious
[1:00:38] Doctrine some catechism or Creed or
[1:00:41] Dogma that he was accepted for a comfort
[1:00:43] for himself but when he really comes to
[1:00:45] a place like Moses did on the back side
[1:00:47] of the desert walk up face to face with
[1:00:49] almighty God and you see the voice
[1:00:52] speaking to you exactly with the word
[1:00:54] and the promise of the hour there is
[1:00:56] something it does to you now amen now
[1:01:00] we're going to find out that we can meet
[1:01:03] God face to face like Moses met God face
[1:01:05] to face like the children of Israel met
[1:01:07] God face to face like Jacob met God face
[1:01:09] to face we can meet God face to face do
[1:01:13] you believe the prophet met God face to
[1:01:15] face amen but I don't think God wants it
[1:01:18] to stop there the prophet's telling us
[1:01:20] that that that when a man like Moses did
[1:01:22] on the back side of the desert walk up
[1:01:24] Faith face to face with God and you see
[1:01:26] the voice speaking to you exactly what
[1:01:29] the word what should we be looking for
[1:01:32] when we come in contact with God face to
[1:01:33] face the voice that should be speaking
[1:01:35] should be matching the word and when you
[1:01:37] see exactly with the word and the
[1:01:39] promise of the hour then there's
[1:01:40] something that it does to
[1:01:42] you amen how did they recognize him in
[1:01:45] the Garden of Eden by a voice they
[1:01:47] recognize his presence by a voice amen
[1:01:50] he re Moses recognized when he spoke to
[1:01:52] him they recognized him in the fire Amen
[1:01:54] in the smoke when he spoke the
[1:01:57] Commandments praise God how are we going
[1:02:00] to come face to face with God are we
[1:02:03] going to wait until we see something
[1:02:06] going to wait till a future day or can
[1:02:09] we come face to face with God
[1:02:14] today in the book of Acts we speaking of
[1:02:17] this Apostle Paul when he yet saw on his
[1:02:19] way to Damascus says at midday oh King I
[1:02:22] saw on the way a light from heaven
[1:02:25] above the brightness of the sun shining
[1:02:26] around about me and them which Journey
[1:02:29] with me and when we were all Fallen to
[1:02:31] the earth I heard a voice speaking unto
[1:02:33] me saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul
[1:02:36] why persecutest thou me it is hard for
[1:02:38] thee to kick against the Pricks and I
[1:02:40] said who art thou Lord and he said I am
[1:02:42] Jesus whom thou
[1:02:45] persecuted here here uh the Apostle Paul
[1:02:48] he's yet Saul now he's not been
[1:02:50] converted yet but here Paul amen he
[1:02:53] comes face to face with Jesus Christ but
[1:02:56] what does he see he doesn't see a
[1:02:58] similitude of a person he doesn't see
[1:03:00] the form of Jesus Christ he sees a
[1:03:02] bright light but the bright light spoke
[1:03:05] and what it was when he come face to
[1:03:07] face with Jesus Christ it was the voice
[1:03:10] coming from the light that declared who
[1:03:12] he
[1:03:13] was
[1:03:15] amen and then he said who are you he
[1:03:17] said I'm Jesus whom you
[1:03:19] persecuted Jesus had already lived Amen
[1:03:22] in the flesh he had already lived his
[1:03:23] life he been crucified amen he had been
[1:03:26] buried he had been resurrected and now
[1:03:28] Jesus had come back and entered into the
[1:03:30] Flesh of a many membered body and he was
[1:03:33] there because Saul was not persecuting
[1:03:36] amen Jesus In the Flesh that body with
[1:03:39] the nail scars he was persecuting the
[1:03:41] Church of the Living God and he says I
[1:03:43] am Jesus whom you
[1:03:47] persecute what did he see what form he
[1:03:50] saw a light amen and that light was
[1:03:53] Jesus was was the light
[1:03:55] Jesus
[1:03:57] amen but yet that light was in the
[1:04:01] church is that right so was the church
[1:04:05] Jesus Christ yes because it was the
[1:04:08] Tabernacle of Jesus Christ he was there
[1:04:10] when he persecuted the church he
[1:04:12] persecuted Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ amen they couldn't see any form
[1:04:18] they couldn't see the same Jesus that
[1:04:20] was crucified but it was the same Jesus
[1:04:22] that was crucified was now speaking to
[1:04:26] Paul and he recognized him by a
[1:04:31] voice brother B says look at Paul when
[1:04:33] Paul was a great Theologian but when he
[1:04:35] come face to face with the word what did
[1:04:39] he come face to face with when he come
[1:04:40] face to face with the word Jesus it
[1:04:44] quickened he came to life right quick
[1:04:46] because he was ordained to be
[1:04:49] that
[1:04:51] oh we have an opportunity to come face
[1:04:53] to face with the
[1:04:55] word who's the
[1:05:00] word praise
[1:05:03] God spoken words the original C he said
[1:05:06] I
[1:05:07] believe the Bible is the word the whole
[1:05:09] truth and Jesus is the word made
[1:05:13] manifest he and his word is one and the
[1:05:19] same I want to come face to face with
[1:05:23] God I want to come face to face with
[1:05:25] Jesus Christ but what form will I see
[1:05:28] what form am I looking for should I look
[1:05:30] for a light like Paul saw a light should
[1:05:33] I look for smoke and Fire on the
[1:05:35] Mountain what should I look for amen I
[1:05:38] should I should recognize him by a
[1:05:43] voice he says what are you going to do
[1:05:46] with him this Jesus called Christ Christ
[1:05:50] is the anointed word what are you going
[1:05:51] to do with it it's the message of the
[1:05:55] hour what is Christ what is Jesus Christ
[1:05:58] Christ is the word amen in the beginning
[1:06:00] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:06:02] and the Word was God Amen and then verse
[1:06:04] 14 says the word was made flesh and
[1:06:06] dwelt Among Us amen Jesus Christ was the
[1:06:08] word made flesh and brother benam said
[1:06:11] Christ is the anointed word and
[1:06:12] elsewhere he said he's the anointed word
[1:06:14] for your day yes amen what form are we
[1:06:18] looking for he can take on all kinds of
[1:06:20] forms and we know what form he's in in
[1:06:22] this day he's in the form of the Bride
[1:06:24] he's a many membered bride is where he's
[1:06:26] at but we're recognizing him not just by
[1:06:28] a form because anybody can say I'm bride
[1:06:30] I'm bride I'm bride any group anybody
[1:06:33] can say I'm bride they can take on a
[1:06:35] similitude so should I look to that no I
[1:06:38] should listen for a voice coming from
[1:06:40] behind that representation of God that
[1:06:42] manifestation of God should have a voice
[1:06:45] and the voice should declare the word
[1:06:46] for this
[1:06:49] day sir
[1:06:52] amen praise be to God
[1:06:55] this message brother brandham was a son
[1:06:59] of man revealing the son of man who is
[1:07:02] the son of man Jesus Christ so where was
[1:07:05] Jesus
[1:07:06] Christ amen he was in that son of man
[1:07:10] declaring
[1:07:11] himself amen is that right that's why
[1:07:14] people would be so mistaken by the
[1:07:16] manifestation they would begin to
[1:07:18] worship the flesh Tabernacle of brother
[1:07:20] bam assuming that he's Jesus Christ amen
[1:07:23] and I don't know if you remember do you
[1:07:24] remember Dawson Riley's testimony when
[1:07:26] when he begins to tell Dawson Riley amen
[1:07:28] did you hear what's going up with Canada
[1:07:30] they're baptizing people in my name does
[1:07:33] anybody remember
[1:07:34] that and and brother Dawson was thinking
[1:07:38] oh wow that's bad and brother brandom
[1:07:40] said they're not as far off as you
[1:07:44] think what a statement
[1:07:47] friends that was a form but God was
[1:07:50] behind the form but how did we recognize
[1:07:52] what did we hear when we came to this
[1:07:53] message we heard a voice amen the voice
[1:07:56] was back in the garden again and we
[1:07:58] recognized he was in our midst by a
[1:08:00] voice and that voice was speaking the
[1:08:02] word amen and it wasn't just the word
[1:08:04] for Luther's day the word for Wesley's
[1:08:06] day it was the word for our day amen we
[1:08:08] heard his voice and we can stand face to
[1:08:11] face with God
[1:08:13] again praise
[1:08:15] God brother man says in the message
[1:08:17] absolute Paul didn't always have the ti
[1:08:20] poost he used to be tied to the group of
[1:08:22] the Pharisees and he had had to be
[1:08:24] trained and educated so that they would
[1:08:26] accept him and let him tie himself to
[1:08:28] their post but one day he was on the
[1:08:30] road down to Damascus and he met Jesus
[1:08:33] face to face and from there he cut loose
[1:08:36] from the Fise TI poost and retied
[1:08:38] himself again that Jesus who he had
[1:08:40] knowed was crucified died and rose again
[1:08:43] Paul knew it because he met the person
[1:08:46] that changed him right there he was
[1:08:48] never the same for he was never the same
[1:08:50] from then on he never just met a book he
[1:08:53] never just met a Creed he met the person
[1:08:56] Jesus
[1:08:57] Christ when you know when we say the
[1:09:00] message is Christ I'm not talking about
[1:09:03] recorded
[1:09:07] messages I'm talking about the person of
[1:09:09] Jesus Christ that declared himself
[1:09:11] through recorded messages I'm not
[1:09:13] talking about printed books I'm not
[1:09:14] that's not what I'm talking about amen
[1:09:16] I'm not here to to worship a book I
[1:09:19] don't believe in just a book I believe
[1:09:20] in the one the book's talking about the
[1:09:22] one the book is unveiling to me this is
[1:09:25] the unveiling of God in this message God
[1:09:28] has unveiled himself so that we can
[1:09:30] Behold Him in all of his glory and meet
[1:09:32] him face to face amen why because he's
[1:09:34] had a voice in this day amen the voice
[1:09:37] of God Amen brother Brenham one time was
[1:09:39] preaching in 1951 and he says I am the
[1:09:42] voice of God to
[1:09:46] you is that right it wasn't these vocal
[1:09:50] cords amen it was the very thought of
[1:09:53] God that was being expressed God had
[1:09:55] come down and declared himself and he
[1:09:57] was recognized by a
[1:09:59] voice praise be to God brother brandham
[1:10:02] saw him on all kinds of forms brother
[1:10:04] bam saw a pillar of fire he saw a light
[1:10:06] that manifested to an angel he saw all
[1:10:09] kinds of
[1:10:10] things but he knew it was God speaking
[1:10:12] to him all the time it was
[1:10:19] gone and the message in absolute he says
[1:10:22] now today if we're trusting only an
[1:10:25] education or mechanical way of Education
[1:10:28] to explain the Bible then we've only got
[1:10:30] it from a mental conception but no man
[1:10:33] has the right behind the pulpit preach
[1:10:35] the gospel unless he has come face to
[1:10:37] face with it like Moses on the backside
[1:10:39] of the desert no matter how well he was
[1:10:41] educated whatever whatever had taken
[1:10:44] place his fears and frustrations left
[1:10:47] because he stood on a sacred ground with
[1:10:48] God that nobody could take it away from
[1:10:51] him and every man or woman that has an
[1:10:53] experience with God has met this same
[1:10:55] Pillar of Fire upon the sacred grounds
[1:10:58] of your heart there is no Theologian no
[1:11:01] devil no nothing Paul said nothing
[1:11:03] present nothing future death sickness
[1:11:05] sorrow can separate us from the love of
[1:11:07] God that's in Christ Jesus it's a tyst
[1:11:10] you know something happened no matter
[1:11:12] how much science raised up raises this
[1:11:14] that or the other you are tied you and
[1:11:17] God become one he's in you and you're in
[1:11:20] him why because through this message
[1:11:23] he's given a voice in this day and that
[1:11:25] voice is the voice of God just like at
[1:11:28] Mount Si and we've got an option we can
[1:11:30] run away from that voice or we can run
[1:11:32] to that voice and stand before God face
[1:11:34] to
[1:11:36] face you know the Apostle Paul was
[1:11:38] struck down by a light and that light
[1:11:40] had a voice behind it and that voice was
[1:11:42] Jesus Christ and he says who are you
[1:11:44] Lord amen he know he went back into the
[1:11:46] form of Pillar of Fire which he was
[1:11:48] before amen and he says I'm I'm Jesus
[1:11:50] whom you persecute but you know there
[1:11:52] was other men with Paul and those other
[1:11:54] men did not clearly understand what the
[1:11:56] voice said they heard something but they
[1:11:58] didn't hear a voice am mean they heard
[1:12:00] something but they saw no man they saw a
[1:12:02] light but then they didn't hear there's
[1:12:03] several different reports in the Bible
[1:12:06] what does it show it looks like a
[1:12:07] confusion maybe the story doesn't match
[1:12:09] what it shows amen is no matter how loud
[1:12:12] The Voice rings out only the elect will
[1:12:15] hear the voice and meet God face to face
[1:12:17] they were all there when the light shine
[1:12:19] but only Paul's the one who met Jesus
[1:12:22] Christ they were there when Jesus was
[1:12:24] declaring himself in a pillar of fire
[1:12:26] they were there when he was thundering
[1:12:27] out the word but only the elect
[1:12:29] predestinated met God face to face how
[1:12:33] many people sat in brother benham's
[1:12:35] meetings and how many heard the word
[1:12:36] preached and how many were there for the
[1:12:38] seals but only a few met God face to
[1:12:42] face how many listened to the text how
[1:12:45] many read the books how many said in the
[1:12:46] message Church how many hear the
[1:12:48] anointed preaching of the word but how
[1:12:50] many meet God face to
[1:12:52] face because we got to go beyond the
[1:12:54] image before our eyes and go past that
[1:12:57] and who's behind the image who's past
[1:12:59] the veil who's beyond all of that it's
[1:13:02] God back there declaring himself showing
[1:13:04] that I am present you can meet me face
[1:13:06] to face not a book not a tape not a
[1:13:10] greed not a new teaching amen but the
[1:13:12] person he's declaring himself by a
[1:13:18] voice and we can meet
[1:13:20] him face to face you can come to the
[1:13:24] same service and hear the same exact
[1:13:26] words and one person will have met God
[1:13:29] face to face and they would have their
[1:13:31] lives discerned and their questions
[1:13:33] answered and Direction and instruction
[1:13:36] and it' be almost
[1:13:37] prophetic and another person will sit
[1:13:40] there and I got nothing and I saw
[1:13:41] nothing and that man behind the pull Pit
[1:13:43] and the other person said I didn't even
[1:13:44] see the man behind the pull pit that was
[1:13:46] God speaking to
[1:13:48] me how can how can we walk out of the
[1:13:51] same service in somebody's mirac ously
[1:13:53] delivered and somebody's all tied up in
[1:13:57] knots because we got to look Beyond the
[1:13:59] Veil and listen for a
[1:14:04] voice we can meet God face to
[1:14:08] face
[1:14:11] amen praise be to
[1:14:17] God every man or woman that has had an
[1:14:20] experience with God that you and God in
[1:14:24] personal contact that means you've went
[1:14:27] beyond the church you went beyond the
[1:14:30] service you went beyond the tape you
[1:14:32] went
[1:14:33] beyond the
[1:14:35] vessels and you went beyond to the one
[1:14:38] that was behind all of that
[1:14:41] speaking Beyond you know when when they
[1:14:46] were there on Mount sin it was all thick
[1:14:49] darkness and clouds and fire and Light
[1:14:53] is that
[1:14:55] right and God speaking out of the midst
[1:14:58] of it and he was declaring his word and
[1:15:02] he says when you hear the trumpet sound
[1:15:04] long what's the long trumpet it was this
[1:15:06] Covenant it was these
[1:15:07] words when you hear that then come to me
[1:15:11] in the mountain and instead of coming
[1:15:14] they ran
[1:15:17] away why because what they saw
[1:15:20] frightened them what they heard they
[1:15:21] couldn't endure they couldn't go and we
[1:15:24] know it was all God's timing we know
[1:15:25] more the drama had to be played out we
[1:15:27] understand that but they said Moses you
[1:15:29] go and Moses could go beyond the
[1:15:33] mountain beyond the fire beyond the
[1:15:36] smoke into the thick Darkness where God
[1:15:41] was where was God he was behind it all
[1:15:44] he was in the midst of it all Moses
[1:15:46] could go into the darkness up into the
[1:15:49] mount into the scary quaky everything
[1:15:52] that made him tremble trembling Quake
[1:15:54] but where was God God was speaking out
[1:15:56] of the midst of it and Moses was able to
[1:15:58] go
[1:16:00] there
[1:16:02] amen I say God help me to see you face
[1:16:06] to face and go beyond all the voices and
[1:16:10] everything that you're sharing and
[1:16:12] showing and all the ways in which you
[1:16:14] declare yourself but help me to keep
[1:16:16] going until I come in contact with
[1:16:19] you like Moses did don't want to be like
[1:16:22] the children of Israel I want to go
[1:16:26] myself into the thick Darkness where God
[1:16:29] is I want to know him be known by
[1:16:35] him 1 Corinthians 13:9 says for we know
[1:16:39] in part we prophesy in part but when
[1:16:42] that which is perfect is come then that
[1:16:44] which is in part shall be done away when
[1:16:46] I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:16:49] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:16:50] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:16:53] childish things for now we see through a
[1:16:56] glass
[1:16:57] Darkly but then face to
[1:17:01] face when is then that's a good question
[1:17:05] when is then well if you go to verse 10
[1:17:10] you'll see the word
[1:17:11] when then relates to
[1:17:14] when if I was an English teacher I would
[1:17:17] tell you what all this means what kind
[1:17:19] of words these are and all of that but
[1:17:21] then relates to win when will this be
[1:17:26] when that which is perfect has
[1:17:29] come then that which is inart shall be
[1:17:31] done
[1:17:32] away brother brandham goes to the
[1:17:34] scripture and he reads the scripture and
[1:17:36] says but what we do have now by the
[1:17:38] grace of God is the perfect
[1:17:40] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:17:44] Vindication amen and the perfect word is
[1:17:47] not the perfect word listen this is why
[1:17:51] we have so much trouble sometimes in the
[1:17:52] message because the a perfect word is
[1:17:54] not a perfect teaching amen and like
[1:17:57] brother bam perfectly laid it all out no
[1:17:59] he he does it the way he can he says it
[1:18:01] this way one time and this example
[1:18:03] another time and it's all jumbled up and
[1:18:05] it'll start explaining it'll jump off on
[1:18:06] stories and it'll switch subjects and
[1:18:08] it'll come back to it that's not what he
[1:18:10] means by the perfect word it's not laid
[1:18:12] out perfectly it's the perfect
[1:18:14] understanding it's God it's the
[1:18:16] unveiling of God it's the mystery of God
[1:18:18] now complete and unveiled before
[1:18:21] us hallelujah the mystery of God should
[1:18:24] be finished in the voice of the seventh
[1:18:27] Angels amen what was those seals what
[1:18:29] was the preaching of the seals revealing
[1:18:31] Christ because Christ is those seals
[1:18:33] that was
[1:18:34] revealed so what is the revealing of the
[1:18:36] seals amen more Doctrine more perfect
[1:18:39] it's a perfect word the perfect word is
[1:18:41] a person he is the person of the
[1:18:44] word and he's standing behind a prophet
[1:18:47] unveiling
[1:18:49] himself face to face with with those who
[1:18:53] will receive
[1:18:55] it amen for now we see through a glass
[1:19:01] Darkly I love this but then then relates
[1:19:05] to when when is when that which is
[1:19:08] perfect has come do you believe we
[1:19:10] received a perfect word do you believe
[1:19:13] it's Christ himself that opened the
[1:19:15] seals he himself who took the veil off
[1:19:18] the word he himself who taught brother
[1:19:19] bandam comes to the end of the seals he
[1:19:21] says now don't say thank you to any
[1:19:23] man don't tell me any preacher anybody
[1:19:26] don't say thank you it wasn't a pre it
[1:19:27] wasn't a man what's he doing brother B
[1:19:30] doesn't say this about any other message
[1:19:32] he preaches you notice that he comes to
[1:19:33] the end of the seals because he wants
[1:19:35] you to know he did not preach those
[1:19:37] seals amen he would have got them all
[1:19:40] wrong if an angel of the Lord hadn't
[1:19:41] showed up every day and told him exactly
[1:19:43] why cuz only the lamb can open the seals
[1:19:46] and loose the
[1:19:47] seals he's got he's got to let you know
[1:19:50] I didn't do this there was something
[1:19:52] behind me I was the vessel he was
[1:19:54] standing behind amen but it was Christ
[1:19:56] himself the lamb that took the book and
[1:19:58] loosed the
[1:20:00] seals so don't say thank you to any man
[1:20:03] amen don't think it's a preacher or some
[1:20:05] man no man this was not the works of
[1:20:08] William brandom this was the works of
[1:20:10] Jesus Christ this is not the Revelation
[1:20:12] coming through William it's coming
[1:20:13] through William brandom but not through
[1:20:15] his mind amen his mind was wrong it came
[1:20:17] direct from God to the man he would see
[1:20:20] it in vision and have to take up a pen
[1:20:22] and write it
[1:20:25] down what was he writing down Jesus
[1:20:28] Christ revealing himself through the
[1:20:30] seals what is the opening of the seals
[1:20:32] revealing Christ Christ is the seals
[1:20:34] that was
[1:20:35] revealed oh if we could go
[1:20:38] beyond the text you'll find the
[1:20:44] person we have a perfect word it's not
[1:20:47] so you can go to a textbook somewhere
[1:20:50] and say this subject this answer no it's
[1:20:55] a perfect word Jesus Christ the word
[1:20:59] came and revealed himself
[1:21:03] completely and everybody can hear it but
[1:21:06] not everybody can see
[1:21:11] it everybody can hear it but not
[1:21:14] everybody can receive
[1:21:17] it that's why Jesus said to his
[1:21:20] disciples when they asked him about you
[1:21:22] know John the Baptist and Elias they
[1:21:25] have these questions Jesus did not say
[1:21:28] this is Elias who should have come he
[1:21:30] didn't say that he said if you can
[1:21:33] receive
[1:21:36] it if you can receive it this is Elijah
[1:21:41] that's right if you can't receive it
[1:21:43] then it's not
[1:21:46] Elijah who is this you understand it has
[1:21:50] to come by Revelation and that's only to
[1:21:52] a predestin at group even Jesus himself
[1:21:55] was not forcing the Revelation upon
[1:21:57] anybody he knew it was but he said if
[1:21:58] you can receive it this is who that was
[1:22:02] if you can receive
[1:22:04] it praise
[1:22:06] God for now we see through a glass
[1:22:10] Darkly but then face to face we're
[1:22:12] wrapping
[1:22:13] up this word glass is the word
[1:22:20] Mirror
[1:22:21] Mirror
[1:22:23] when you look into a mirror what do you
[1:22:29] see when you look into a mirror do you
[1:22:31] see somebody else or do you see your own
[1:22:33] image looking
[1:22:35] back what do you see when you look into
[1:22:38] a mirror that's what this word glass
[1:22:41] means in the Greek it means
[1:22:43] mirror but now we're seeing through a
[1:22:46] mirror
[1:22:48] Darkly but then face to
[1:22:51] face now now we know in part but then
[1:22:54] shall I know even as also I am
[1:22:58] known when that which is perfect has
[1:23:01] come I'll be able to pick up the mirror
[1:23:04] of this
[1:23:05] word and I'll
[1:23:07] say where is God
[1:23:10] hiding in this
[1:23:13] day where is the veil that he's speaking
[1:23:20] behind where is the final voice to the
[1:23:23] final age what voice is that it's the
[1:23:26] voice of God where is it the voice is in
[1:23:29] the
[1:23:31] bride so if I want to know where the
[1:23:33] voice of God is calling out from in the
[1:23:35] end time his voice is in his bride and
[1:23:40] she will be the final voice to the final
[1:23:42] age and when that which is perfect has
[1:23:43] come there'll be a cleaning agent that
[1:23:45] comes on the
[1:23:47] mirror amen cuz now we see through glass
[1:23:50] Darkly but when that which is perfect
[1:23:51] has come there'll be a clean cleaning
[1:23:52] agent that will clear all the smudge
[1:23:54] away until you can look at the word and
[1:23:56] you can do like that little boy in his
[1:23:58] aunt's house and say it's me mama that's
[1:24:00] me oh God it's me that he's talking
[1:24:03] about I understand the mystery now I
[1:24:05] know what's been hidden in the back part
[1:24:07] of God's mind all of this time now I
[1:24:09] know where God wants to dwell he wants
[1:24:11] to dwell in
[1:24:13] me talking about meeting him face to
[1:24:16] face where will you Mee him face to face
[1:24:17] in your soul in you is where that
[1:24:19] meeting place is where will you have
[1:24:22] your experience of God you'll experience
[1:24:24] God in your heart in your soul that's
[1:24:26] the meeting place where you meet God you
[1:24:28] got to go beyond the darkness of Flesh
[1:24:30] beyond the darkness of your mind and get
[1:24:32] down to where God is hiding in your soul
[1:24:35] and that's where he wants to see you
[1:24:37] face to
[1:24:39] face when will we see face to face when
[1:24:41] that which is perfect has
[1:24:44] come this is the last scripture I want
[1:24:47] to read psalms
[1:24:50] 278 when thou says seek ye my face my
[1:24:55] heart said unto thee thy face Lord will
[1:24:57] I seek hide not thy face far from me put
[1:25:01] not thy servant away in Anger thou has
[1:25:03] been my help leave me not neither
[1:25:05] forsake me oh god of my salvation when
[1:25:09] David writes this Psalm and When God
[1:25:12] says when thou sayest seeky my face do
[1:25:14] you think God is telling uh David come
[1:25:18] find my actual physical face so you can
[1:25:21] know what size my noses so you could
[1:25:23] draw it out no seek my person seek me
[1:25:26] seek after me to come to me in a
[1:25:29] personal relationship seek ye my face
[1:25:32] because no man can see his
[1:25:36] face is that what God told Moses so why
[1:25:40] would he say no man can see my face
[1:25:42] until David to seek my face it's not
[1:25:44] that kind of
[1:25:46] face he wants you to seek him him come
[1:25:51] face to face means is very personal not
[1:25:54] from a distance not from far away not
[1:25:57] through another you know not through a a
[1:26:00] telephone not through a
[1:26:02] messenger but seek my
[1:26:06] face my heart said unto thee thy face
[1:26:10] Lord will I
[1:26:11] seek let's all stand brother Ben if you
[1:26:15] and the musicians can make your way
[1:26:17] up I barely went over an
[1:26:20] hour thank God
[1:26:25] when the Lord said seek my
[1:26:28] face you know the the Lord wants to be
[1:26:31] sought
[1:26:33] after the Bible says seek and you shall
[1:26:35] find knock and the door shall be God
[1:26:37] wants to be sought
[1:26:40] after he's not a cheap date that should
[1:26:42] be sought
[1:26:45] cheaply when it was scary in Sinai they
[1:26:48] ran away but when it was scary in sin
[1:26:50] Moses
[1:26:51] went
[1:26:54] with seek and you shall find knock and
[1:26:57] the door shall be open he said you'll
[1:27:00] seek after me and you shall find me when
[1:27:02] you search for me with all your
[1:27:05] heart God wants to be found he wants to
[1:27:08] be sought he wants to meet us face to
[1:27:11] face amen but he wants us to seek his
[1:27:14] face seek his
[1:27:16] person seek his presence seek him he
[1:27:21] doesn't want us to seek a group he
[1:27:23] doesn't want us to seek a Doctrine he
[1:27:25] doesn't want us to seek a teaching he
[1:27:26] wants us to seek
[1:27:29] Him we've got to push
[1:27:32] beyond all the ways in which he
[1:27:35] expresses himself to find him what is he
[1:27:40] he's the invisible God how's he
[1:27:41] expressing himself now in Bride form I
[1:27:44] believe
[1:27:46] that but he is behind the bride form
[1:27:50] it's him it's him I want I want to go to
[1:27:54] the invisible part that's deep
[1:27:57] inside shrouded in darkness sure but
[1:28:01] that's where he
[1:28:03] dwells and I want to come make a
[1:28:05] personal contact with
[1:28:07] him when you said seeking my face my
[1:28:11] heart said not my brain my heart said
[1:28:14] your face will I seek and I want to seek
[1:28:18] it with all of my heart for if I seek it
[1:28:21] with all of my heart heart he'll be
[1:28:24] found why because he spoke in our day
[1:28:27] he's present he's made his presence
[1:28:29] known by his voice and he can be
[1:28:32] found let's bow our heads and pray dear
[1:28:36] heavenly father we thank you Lord
[1:28:38] Jesus God it would have been
[1:28:41] impossible impossible for us to find our
[1:28:44] way to

[1:28:49] you but you showed us where you you
[1:28:52] are you told us where you are you came

[1:29:35] seals was hiding
