[0:00] you get to the end of life you don't
[0:01] have the physical strength you had you
[0:03] don't have the mental strength that you
[0:04] used to have you can't cover everything
[0:06] in life by your
[0:09] youthfulness weakness starts to creep in
[0:11] and it will for all of us and as
[0:13] weakness Creeps in we begin to realize I
[0:16] can't do what I used to do I can't care
[0:17] for myself I can't make it happen I
[0:19] don't have what I used to have I don't
[0:21] think like I used to do I don't act like
[0:23] I used to do what is it I need more than
[0:25] anything I need him more than anything I
[0:27] need he that's greater in me than he
[0:29] that's in this world because this guy is
[0:31] letting me down what I used to depend on
[0:33] to earn money Amen to fix things that
[0:35] were broke to overcome challenges in my
[0:37] life I used to depend on this flesh yes
[0:42] I used to when I was in my 20s when I
[0:44] was in my 30s I could work around the
[0:46] clock there was days that I put in 40
[0:48] some hours at work and I never slept and
[0:50] I was still
[0:52] fine and my my Montage was always work
[0:55] harder if you got a problem work harder
[0:57] you need more money work more hours if
[0:59] you got overcome something you just work
[1:01] that's all you got to do is work amen
[1:03] what happens when you can't work
[1:05] anymore you realize for many of us in
[1:08] our youthful years we were relying on
[1:10] the outer man we were relying on our own
[1:12] intellect and our own strength and our
[1:14] outer man and we could always overcome
[1:16] obstacles because we were still young
[1:17] and still vibrant and we could still
[1:18] think and we could still process we
[1:20] could still
[1:22] do that's why the most glorious time in
[1:25] a child of God's life is when those
[1:26] leaves are changing colors
[1:30] cuz maybe they've learned a few things
[1:32] along the way I can't walk like I used
[1:35] to I can't overcome I can't I can't
[1:37] build a house
[1:39] anymore can't re-roof my house I can't
[1:42] fix my car like I used to
[1:45] I amen so what are we left with I need
[1:49] God I need the spirit of God to lead me
[1:51] every day of my
[1:53] life oh God help me to get
[1:56] there
[1:58] now I said go God help you if you're 15
[2:01] 16 17 19 20 21 God help you get there
[2:05] now because God never intended for man
[2:08] to sh shift for himself he wanted to be
[2:10] completely relling upon
[2:12] God where is your overcoming power in
[2:15] you amen where is he that overcometh in
[2:18] you how will he overcome by might in the
[2:20] Inner
[2:23] Man where is everything that I have need
[2:25] of coming from that which is inside of
[2:28] me you know what I need to do more than
[2:30] anything more than get up early and work
[2:31] more hours what I need to do is get up
[2:33] early and talk to him
[2:35] longer spend more time aligning my
[2:37] thinging with his ling read his word
[2:39] pray meditate just think on him listen
[2:42] to good things listen to sermons listen
[2:45] to music do something to De feed the
[2:47] Inside Man so that I could drink and
[2:49] drink and drink and then I'm not God
[2:51] there's nothing for me to put on on the
[2:53] outside there's nothing for me to
[2:54] correct or make happen what needs to
[2:56] happen will come from the strength from
[2:58] the inner man amen
[3:01] greater is he that is in you than he
[3:04] that's in the world that's nothing but
[3:07] the truth
[3:08] friends and the evil one is that body
[3:11] you live in and the world is influencing
[3:15] that body in your mind all the time the
[3:18] lust of the eyes the the lust of the
[3:20] flesh the pride of
[3:22] life so where am I going to overcome it
[3:25] not through more mind not through more
[3:28] intellect not through more willpower
[3:29] there's the problem where am I going to
[3:32] overcome it with the Inside Man
