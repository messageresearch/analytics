TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i love [Music] to be like him [Applause] all through life's turning from earth to glory i only have to be like him without the music to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i love to be like all through life's journeys from earth to glory i only [Music] what a goal to have in life i think that is the goal friends i mean let's just uh bow our heads and pray before we read lord jesus we thank you father that you've put inside of us a desire to be like you not the model after the world lord not to model after a sports hero or a figure a figurehead or a political figure or some star that the world calls a star but god you've put it in our heart to be like you and we know to be like you we have to be like the word lord so you've come in this day and revealed the word so we knew what to be like god we ask now that you would take this word and further unveil it to our hearts lord that we might be more like you that you'd have preeminence among us that you would take control and god that we would yield ourselves in a greater way to you lord that all willfulness would fade away all selfishness and self-desire lord would we'd lay it on the altar lord and you would strip it from us then we might be a clean vessel that you can use for your glory while we just pray that you would have greater preeminence than you've ever had in us as individuals that you'd shine forth the light of your glory in a greater way god take control of this service take control of these lips lord speak your eternal words lord to the hearts of your people we receive your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen while we're standing just before we're seated let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelation we'll read from revelation verse 21 and i'd like to take a subject title shining forth light and it's um if we can do it maybe in the way of a bible study i got a lot of scriptures i'd like to read together so keep your bibles handy but it's a simple thought it's not a complex thought it's a simple thought but it has deep impact deep meaning it's it's amazing how simple thoughts run deep and so i i want to look at this together and just take some time here for this wednesday night and look at this subject revelation 21 verse 9. revelation 21-9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was likened to a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal so i want to hone in on this last verse having the glory of god and her light her light was like unto a stone most precious even a jasper stone clear as crystal you can be seated so this is a verse 11 is is where i want to draw our context for our text and i want to spend some time on this and i want to look at a couple things because it's interesting that it would say her light is likened to a stone most precious because the stone doesn't have light and that's what's interesting about this is what caught my attention in this scripture and i think it's written this way specifically for a reason because the stone doesn't have any light of his own because the only light that a stone would have even as we think stone we think rocks out there but but if we think of gems gems are also stones diamonds gems rubies emeralds all of these other stones and these stones don't have lights of their own but they reflect light it's reflected light and so when we look at the light or the brilliance or the luster of a diamond or of an emerald of a ruby amen what it is what's sparkling our eye and what is catching our attention and the light or the fire that is coming from this gem is actually light that's reflected back out of the gem it's light that has come in and light that's reflected back out and so i think it's interesting that her light is likened to a stone which means which means she's reflecting light likened to a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clearest crystal and uh there's a few few things we want to gather out of that that i found to be most interesting if i could just make a few notes i'll give you a few of my notes jasper if you look at jasper jasper's one of the stones that's mentioned it's a gem that's mentioned in the bible several times but but one of the times that jasper's mentioned is in the breastplate that aaron wore that had the 12 stones representing the 12 tribes of israel and so this jasper stone we know is the 12th stone mentioned it's on the fourth row it's the third gem on the fourth row making it the twelfth amen and it represents each of these stones represent one of the tribes amen and this stone represents benjamin or the last tribe and it's funny now that we've come down to the end of time the end of the gentile dispensation and right at the very end there'll be a revelation of the bride a revelation of new jerusalem and her light will be not the first not the second not the third but the last amen little benjamin jasper jasper is an interesting word in the hebrew because jasper is taken from a root word and that root word means to polish polish i don't think there's any mistakes here that we we've come to the end to the very end of time the end of the gentile dispensation the end of the church ages and there's going to be a manifestation or a revelation of this great city and brother branham would preach about this in future home amen the new jerusalem the pyramid shaped city amen and and even in future home brother brennan would come to a place where he said i i'd like if it'd be all right i could drop a little something here amen that's good words those are good words when he says something like that you know the radars go up the antenna goes up you'd like to drop a little something and he's talking about the dimensions of this city that'll be after the millennium in the new heavens and new earth the city that descends and rests over top the mountain that'll push up in palestine and he's describing in 1500 miles this way and this way and 1500 miles high and he's describing it thoroughly but then he says if you'd like i could drop a little something here and he's looking at those that have gathered into the church to hear the message and he says it's about what's represented here right now we have people gathered from maine to saskatchewan amen from the rocky coast of maine down down into uh georgia and he's showing about 1500 miles represented here and brother venom is showing that this city is already reflected on earth the city is already being reflected on earth amen because brother brahm told us that our life here is only a reflection of that life over there amen what's over there is being reflected here said if there's a tree struggling to live here it shows there's a tree over there that doesn't struggle to live but there's a man struggling to live here it shows there's a man over there that doesn't struggle to live this life is a reflection of that life i got something for you that will make a few of you excited i just came across today brother ben said these things on earth are reflection of those things over there he said listen even spiders and lizards and snakes are representing demons over there that'll make my girls happy they hate spiders it's okay to hate them because they represent something evil that's why you don't like snakes amen praise god so brother branham is teaching us a lesson in this life there's a reflection going on of that one over there even reflection of some evil things so that brother is telling us in future home that there's a representation or a reflection or a type of that city being expressed on the earth and so we want to look at that when we see this that now we've come to jasper to the last stone and this jasper like i said comes from the root word means to polish this stone is not it's not taken just out of the earth and placed as a gem it's taken out of the earth and it's polished and the act of polishing it or what's called cutting cutting a gem or cutting a diamond the act of cutting it amen is what what really gives it the ability to reflect back light and all of the color and all the brilliance and all the luster and all the fire amen is in the cutting but but i looked it up to see they don't actually cut a diamond if you look at a diamond they don't actually cut a diamond they call it cutting a diamond but what they actually do is polish it and then polish it and polish it and grind it down amen and that's how they get all the angles all those little angles on that diamond amen they've got a wheel that spins that's got diamond dust on it amen and does iron sharpen its iron diamond sharpener diamond amen they place it on the wheel and they begin to cut this diamond in the shape amen and when the master craftsman amen he's got a plan in his mind it's already drawn out what this diamond will be and then he took the rough diamond out of the earth and it was given to a master craftsman and that craftsman amen he could see what kind of diamond that he could get out of this shape amen and he begins amen in order to get this diamond to reflect back in its full luster and brilliance its full capacity the maximum capacity to reflect light amen there has to be material taken away not material added god has plucked us out of the earth as his rare gems that are in the earth amen and what he's got to do is he's got to grind away amen some excess material that came from mom and dad or grandpa or grandma or wherever it came because there's already in his mind he knows the potential of this gem and what it can do what it can be and how it can shine and the master craftsman is working tirelessly day and night to grind away or to polish amen this jasper stone is polished stones that's in this new jerusalem we've come into this earth amen well i'll say like this in a rough condition or in a rough shape but god knows where every gem is lying he knows where every stone in this new jerusalem is lying amen and he finds the stone amen in his hand he begins to polish or remove material remove willfulness remove selfishness remove complexes and what's he trying to do he's trying to get this stone which is stone is revelation he's trying to get this stone to reflect back light in a brilliant way in a beautiful way and this new jerusalem comes down like a jasper stone a great revelation from god a jasper stone clears crystal it's amazing there's a lot of ways that you can rate gems and clarity is one of them diamonds are the same way but this jasper stone it's it's really interesting the way the bible writes this because the jasper stone is not really a clear stone it's not one of the the clear stones but it's the right word because it comes from the root to polish because this stone is going to have to be polished this new jerusalem had to be shaped had to be formed had to be polished and then it's clear as crystal and then when you look at this word clear as crystal i started to reflect on that and clear is crystal means there's nothing to hinder the reflection of the light there's no self there's no cloudiness there's no self there's nothing to diminish the reflection of light and that is what god is looking for when he brings his new jerusalem down as a bride ordained for her husband he's looking for some a stone amen that's been taken off the earth that has been polished and polished and polished and it's a stone that is clear as crystal see that's what jesus christ was he was a stone that was clear as crystal because there was no willfulness in jesus christ that would hinder the will of god i mean you see him in gethsemane battling it out there's a battle between the will he had a will jesus christ had a will that he had to surrender to the will of god amen and he would jesus christ proved in gethsemane that he was clear as crystal because there was no willfulness no self will no self desire no selfishness amen that would hinder the plan of god and that's this new jerusalem coming down like a jasper stone a polish stone clear as crystal and now when we see that we see the goal that god has in his mind and i say this friends this the goal that god had in his mind has in his mind for you and me this is the goal that he has in his mind for you and me amen it doesn't matter how deep and dark and mysterious we were when we were laying in this earth it doesn't matter what deep dungeon he plucked us out of what deep mind out of what myri clay or what stony place that he pulled us out of amen it doesn't matter he knew where we were he knew what we were made of and he knows what our potential is and his goal is to have a jasper stone clear as crystal to do what to shine her light what light do you and i have that we're gonna shine the only light that we have is to reflect his light and his light is his word amen and the thing that the bride is reflecting this day is his word see brother branham says in in the message question and answer is law having a shadow said all things of shadows and types when god made the heavens and the earth he made the moon to shine in the absence of the sun to give light while the sun was gone a beautiful type of christ in the church the church is the moon to give the light to the world while the sun is gone see what i mean a lesser light amen and then otherwise the moon and the sun is husband and wife as christ in the church is husband and wife the wife being the weaker vessel only gives a smaller light in the absence of her husband and the church can only make manifestations of the holy spirit and remember the moon cannot give any light of her own and when you see the moonlight it's not the moonlight it's the reflection of the sunlight but the bible refers to the moon giving her light right and it's it's same same terminology the moon giving her light and brother batman tells us it's not her light it's reflected light off of the sun and what is the moon the moon is a rock a stone representing the bride a stone that is reflecting the light from the sun amen the original light reflecting off of this stone or this revelation of the bride of wife amen is reflecting back to earth amen so this concept is not is is not new to us we understand this brother brethren taught it to us the scriptures declare it and let's let's look at our scripture again in verse 21 revelations 21 18. and the building of the wall of it was jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass we come back to the same thing it's pure gold it's deity deity tabernacled in humanity but deity pure gold pure deity clear as glass so when we start thinking about gold it's not like the gold you have around your finger this is deity that's clear glass clear is glass no that means there's nothing to obstruct the view of the light nothing nothing to diminish the light whatsoever this city when this city comes down and rest upon the earth there'll be nothing nothing in the construction of this city that will diminish the light from shining out from the city one io to one drop and and and furthermore i would say just like in a diamond amen this is just brother chad but just like in the diamond amen that diamond the reason that you get luster and shine is because there's all those angles on the diamond amen and when the light comes in it reflects back and forth through the diamond until it shoots out right and that's what gives it sparkle and luster and what they call fire that comes out and all the colors that come out because the colors are in the light the seven colors of the rainbow are in the light amen but the light when it comes in is white light and reflects around now different panels amen in this diamond starts showing different colors of light and different flashes and different sparkles as you move it around and then because it's cut to do that it's cut to fully display what's in the light amen not not just like a mirror to signaling off but this stone amen where the light will come through the stone and and bounce back and forth in the stone and come out brilliant bright amen shining forth in all angles i think the bride is the show the fullness of the word in all angles all seven church ages all seven colors everything reflecting back the full word of god on display clear his glass verse 22 and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty in the lamb or the temple of it and the city had no need of sun neither of moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof see this city was going to shine forth her light but her light is the light of god and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it see this light was to shine forth unto the nations of the earth come into the city and and god is the light thereof the lamb is the light thereof god lightens it but the lamb is the light thereof amen we know that the lamb sits at the top amen the capstone that's come down the throne is at the top of this great pyramid amen and the light comes down through and reflects out of the city amen and shines to the kingdoms of the world what does that mean brother chad that's the role that we're supposed to be playing right now this is the job of the bride in this day come to the jasper stone the last stone the polish stone amen with the lamb amen the headstone connected to the body the capstone has come down and what was the capstone the fullness of the word that was coming amen to be manifest and that fullness of the word the body the head would rest upon the body and the body would become the manifestation of the headship the head amen didn't manifest the body manifest what's in your head what comes from your mind acts out in your body and that's the same thing that's supposed to be happening now that the the capstone has come amen christ has come the light has come the word has come the full illumination of the full word of god has come and now is supposed to be shining down amen through this city that's on earth now reflecting that city that's coming and through seven church ages been polished polished polished polished polished but it's got to come to the place where it is clear as crystal to shine this light of the lamb brother bam says in revelation chapter 4 from 1961 how would you all like to see him sitting upon his glory let's turn over in revelation 21 10 right quick and just look at him here and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain and showed me the great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god having the glory of god and her light was likened to a stone most precious like a jasper as clear as crystal her light the the light who is the light and the city had no need of sun because the lamb was the light thereof jasper sorry to stone the glory of god is jesus christ the glory of jesus christ is his church catch that the glory of god is jesus christ the glory of jesus christ is his church so when jesus christ came on earth amen god had made himself a body to dwell in the light came the holy ghost came the light connected to that body and he was living his light through that body and jesus christ became the glory of god but now jesus christ fulfilled his role but who's going to shine forth the glory of jesus christ but the glory of jesus christ is the church is the bride is new jerusalem let's turn to first peter first peter chapter 2. first peter chapter 2 verse 4 to whom coming is unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious he all he also has lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by jesus christ so we know he was the first stone to come the cornerstone then from that cornerstone all the other stones were were put together and he says it's living stones and stones that are alive fleshed out alive on this earth living stones or let's put it this way living revelations of the word we say that way a stone represents a revelation and we have to recognize that we as an individual an individual in our size selves are a living stone in this temple and a living stone is a flesh a live revelation of the word in this day not we could say the bride is the brightest the brightest and that's absolutely true but it's got to come down to the individual that i have to be a living stone in this temple i have to be polished as a as a jasper stone i have to be clear as crystal i have to be shining forth the light i have to be a revelation of this word it's not good enough to be near the revelation in this word it's not good enough to be in a church that preaches the revelation of this word but god's goal is for me as an individual stone to be a revelation of this word amen go down to verse 6 wherever also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded until unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumbled at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed so in this great temple in this great pyramid the cornerstone the first stone amen jesus christ came and fleshed the cornerstone by off that cornerstone was built amen the whole building but he's become the head of the corner or the capping stone when the capping stone comes the light comes when the light comes the light's meant to shine out of the city unto the kings of the world let's go to first john i want to hit several scriptures right here in a row see when when we begin to speak like this you know we've preached this way we've talked this way we've hit this from every angle that we can hit but but sometimes it becomes abstract thoughts i think i think it can sometimes become concepts or or analogies or thoughts like this is what it's like and this represents uh in some way this represents the truth amen and and i wanted to move from there and show that that these these aren't just concepts amen these aren't just phrases of speech that come in the message but this is how the bible speaks this is what the bible says this is what the bible is describing what our lives are supposed to be like and what our individual lives are supposed to be doing it's got to move from concept to manifestation it's got to move from phrases to a life and if we keep it as phrases and a neat concept and oh yeah the bride is like that city and i see the light coming down and shining out oh yeah that's neat that's neat it's not neat amen it's imperative that it takes place on the earth and we can't keep putting in the future and putting in the future and someday that city will come down some that that city is upon earth now amen the lamb has come he is here living in his temple living in his city amen in within the living stones who are supposed to be amen polished to perfection and clear as crystal shining that light not their self will not their self-desire not their selfishness amen but shining his light from the head down out every single one of these stones i mean it's not it's not acceptable to say oh i saw that light shining through brother bantam it's only acceptable when the light shines through you and i that we reflect her light all of her collectively together individually every individual shining collectively shining forth the light it's got to move away i meant from the idea to the reality that's my greatest desire for my life amen to take amen what god has revealed and let the revelation bring a manifestation first john 1 5 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all god is light so when we start talking about light we're talking about god and when we talk about this this light shining it's gone amen there's no darkness in him at all amen so anything that would darken the light is not god we put it that way anything that would diminish the light anything that would obscure the light is not god because there's no darkness in him at all he is light he is love he is the word these are all equal to the same thing that's why the word is light that's why the light is the life of men so when you say the word you could just as easily be saying the life you could just as easily be saying the light you could just easily be saying god we gotta we can't separate these things in our mind and make them different categories well this is god and this is the word and this is light and this is life god is life god is light god is the word the word is light the word is life the light is life do we understand that's how important this is when when the word was restored to us at the opening of the word friends that's not just another concept amen that will start a new movement amen but that was god himself amen making himself manifest to his people and how will he be manifest in this world he's only got one place to shine and that's through this city there's no darkness in him at all let's turn to the gospel of john chapter 8. i don't want to fly through this i'm trying not to fly through it i want to read these scriptures they're familiar we know them quite well but i want to read through them together john chapter 8 verse 12 then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life he said i am he i am the light of the world now when jesus was speaking amen if you would have uh been alive in that day you would have thought that the light of the world was the s-u-n that comes up and crosses every day and but but but jesus is speaking of the real light the real light the real life brother said the first the first light that ever shined on the earth was spoken word light and that spoken word light created a sunlight the sunlight is only reflecting a greater light it's only typing another light and jesus says that light that you see that ball of fire that crosses that's not the light of the world he said i am the light of the world i am the light of the world why he was the word made flesh and the word is the light because light has to do with illumination or understanding or revelation let's go to john chapter 9 verse 5. jesus says as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world brother bam says with the message who is jesus he's going to make an analogy here he says some time ago i was writing along with a famous doctor of divinity and he preaches the gospel in seven languages and we were talking about god and his attributes and i was speaking about it i said it's like a diamond god is i like this analogy it's like a diamond god is see and then these gifts that you speak of so they're they're just reflections of god's love and i said like in africa the president of the mind and kimberley was one of my ushers in the line he taken me through the diamond mines and kimberly why you can find them laying on the street but you dare keep one unless it's cut it has to be cut so then a great big diamond it doesn't have the fire in it when you find it no it's got to be cut for that it doesn't have the fire in it amen but it's got the potential to have the fire in it but it's going to be cut for that because the fire comes at the reflection of light after it's cut and that was god and he had to be wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities he is the big diamond and then when you cut a diamond did you ever notice you cut it in a three corner shape and the sun against the that will reflect seven colors he's talking about a prism now and looking red through red looks white did you know that right red through red that's the blood the red blood god's looking at a red center through red blood turns him white he is he is in the heart you see and so now in that said god chipped cut bruce to reflect these rays as it hits the great word of god reflects what god is brother man would take the take even the type of jesus christ being the great diamond and he had to be cut and bruised scourged and beaten to reflect back the light of the word and if jesus christ had to go through that process he wasn't sin born friends what's our process going to be like probably like jasper polish stone let's go over to john 14 now in verse 8. now philip saith in him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus said to him i have been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believe us thou not that i am in the father and the father in me and the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works see it's the same concept brother jesus wasn't saying hey hey hey it's all me no he's saying i am reflecting a light it's not me it's the father that's in me reflecting out and he came as an example of a son of god and that example was going to continue on and he came and he said hey it's why do you ask to see the father have i been so long with you that you don't know me amen it's not me this light isn't me he said i'm the light but it's the father in me because jesus christ was the glory of the father but who's the glory of jesus christ so what's the bride shining jesus christ it's not me it's jesus christ in me it's not me it's the word shining in me reflecting back out of me it's not me i don't do any works i have no works that i can do amen if there's anything that i do it's him reflecting back out of me because he took me out of the earth and he's polished and polished and polished and polished and polished so that he could get something when he would shine light in word in he can get a reflection of word to come back out see cain amen was not a precious gem but abel was understand you know you know what diamond is made out of carbon carbon just regular carbon amen you wanna know what carbon is burn anything take a piece of wood and burn it down to black ash that's carbon it doesn't have luster it doesn't shine amen but that carbon amen when it gets caught in the earth through tectonic plates or whatever there's great heat and pressure friction and pressure put on it it presses it together under extreme heat and pressure and it crystallizes and turns it into a rough diamond and then that diamond is plucked out of the earth and then it's then it's shaped and man it's cut and it's polished amen until it can give back the luster and the shine well you can have two beings made out of the same material of the earth carbon and carbon but they can be nothing alike flesh and flesh this vessel's fleshed this vessel's flesh carbon and carbon but one god has prepared amen and god has sent it to the earth and it's a precious gem abel was a precious gem cain was nothing but carbon and they went through a process a process of time when they knew that they were going to have to bring worship amen and they come to the to the gate at the east of eden and they they were going to bring worship amen but abel abel was cut by revelation and abel oh this is so good if we could catch it when the commandment came when the knowledge came or the understanding however it came that god required a sacrifice and god wanted to be worshipped amen cain amen he began to develop his own way of worship his his own desire to worship god in his own plan for proper worship and when cain began to worship amen what he what he gave back to god was not a reflection of the word it was just a reflection of his mind and his desire and his thoughts and his carbon thinking but abel amen when abel gave back to god when abel took a lamb and when abel slit its throat and shed the blood amen abel did that by revelation he had a revelation from god of what happened in the garden of eden amen and that revelation produced a work amen you realize he didn't outwork cain cain outworked him but his works were accepted and cain's works were rejected because what abel reflected back to god amen was revelation based on revelation he received that revelation came into the cut gem and when it reflected back out it shined through the brilliance of obedience by revelation and when he slayed the lamb it proved that he got it god gave him the revelation amen but when he actually took the lamb and when he actually slayed the lamb and shed the blood it proved that this was a gem the light came in the light reflected around inside and the light came back out and brilliance and in beauty of obedience to the revelation of the word that's why sometimes we get individuals who get so confused sometimes about obedience and then they start to look at legalism and obedience legalism has nothing to do with it it's obedience by revelation amen that's why sometimes you'll see amen a brother or sister i mean they're always walking the edge of the line always you know my my skirt goes past my knees brother venom said the knees and but you see it's so tight and clingy that it shows the form off and shirt the same way and they say but brother brown said i got the quote but you realize there's no revelation of what he was talking about he wasn't talking about a skirt below the knee he was talking about your virtue and your femininity and holding on to that virtue as a sacred trust god gave you and covering your body and keeping it for god and for your husband but when all we saw was the rule or the ordinance or the we we got the word what was that word that word was a bright and shining light but when that word hits carbon corbin doesn't know what to do with the word so they take their own willfulness and own desire and own selfishness and give back to god amen something that came from their own intellect i'm keeping the word i obey i did what the quote said i did what the pastor said but you can see it's all over there's a seductiveness there's a there's a blurring of the lines there's an unclear there's an unclear sound the trumpet's giving and a man who who will live his life on the edge with entertainment and worldliness and won't just kick out the trash but he'll say well brother ben said this and this and that you realize that that's somebody who hasn't yet got the cut down right who hasn't gone where they can take that word come in and bounce it around in my heart amen and bring it back out and brilliance and luster and fire and shine of obedience by revelation that was the difference between cain and abel amen cain he didn't understand amen and when god gave him the word god gave him the commandment god said just do like your brother will do and he'll be fine with you amen he began to despise the commandment because he had no revelation amen the light was hitting him but there was nothing in him to take the light in and to reflect the light back out he was hit by the light god gave him commandment god told him what to do and then he goes and talks to abel the bible doesn't record the conversation but i got a funny idea that abel just shared his revelation so now cain has the word of god he's got word with abel's revelation and he hates it and he kills abel why because he had nothing the word could hit him all day long but there was nothing in him he wasn't of the right material and he wasn't shaped in the right way to take that light of the word in and let it reflect here and reflect here and search out his own heart and come back out of the stone as fire and brilliance and light see the thing that people who are trying to serve god or lacking more than anything is revelation you see it i see it so many times and it breaks your heart because then when you when you start to see somebody going off to the side and getting off the word and they're walking that edge and you start to come down and and preach on that edge because we still have to amen and all of a sudden it set you can watch it it sets up a war of will it sets up a warfare of self-will and all of a sudden there's a there's a i want to be right amen the preacher's saying this and and the message says but it also says this and this person over here told me that brother brown said this and all of a sudden amen it becomes a war of self-will somebody who's trying to serve god who wants to be right who's hearing the word amen but they're struggling and there's a war that's taking place amen and you realize the whole issue is a lack of revelation we would just catch a revelation of why the prophet said that why the word says that amen it becomes a non-issue then all of a sudden you're like god cut me cut me cut that out of me oh god if that's the kind of worship you want i get it i understand i understand why you're asking me to do this and wear this and not wear that and not go these places i get it now because i'm supposed to be clear as crystal because i'm supposed to actually not be a church member but i'm supposed to be you in this earth i get it now amen i thought i was just supposed to go to church and conform to the church and be part of the church and if i conform to the rules of the church i was okay amen missed it wrong revelation it's not about the church that's why people will change churches to find a church that will allow them to do what self-will wants to do and i don't mean that in any mean way i don't mean that sarcastically at all but you can see that's what's happening they're uncomfortable under a certain thing and they'll find a place where they're more comfortable amen instead of just saying what does god give me a revelation of what you want in this hour i want to lay down my life not preserve it i want to give everything up and if that's what you want show me in your word what you want see it's about receiving the light but also about reflecting the light jerusalem new jerusalem was a city come down as a bride adorned for a husband like polish stone clear as crystal and the light from the throne shone out through the city and lighted the world but the only way that was possible is if each stone was clear as crystal see the light could come but if all you had was regular stone blocks the world doesn't get any light we're not here to be part of the church we're here to be as jewels to take the word it's amazing you can take the word sometimes in a simple thought and a simple thought something that you read in the scripture or a preacher will say or brother graham say a simple thought will come in and it will start reflecting bouncing back and forth inside and all of a sudden when it comes back out in your life that simple thought works over here and works here and works here and works here and now i start to show it in this red color and green color and this blue and why because by revelation it's not just this is the rule i do this rule but the revelation now comes this is a principle this is god's mind this is god's desire and if this is god's mind here what about here and if this is god's attitude here what about here and all of a sudden the light comes in and starts doing all this number inside and it comes out it comes out bright it comes out shining it's on fire because it's reflected back to the world see brother branham says here i want to read out of christ is the mystery of god revealed if i could just read a couple quotes that blessed me today it said all those things typed him he's talking about old testament types just in time but yet the mystery was hid then men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation all through the old testament those men were moved by the spirit of god david and noah and abraham and jeremiah not even fully realizing what they were moved by they just knew they were moved by the spirit because god was holding it back for the last days to be a great revelation i hope you don't think he's still holding it back but expressing it expressing himself in moses and david and joseph and elijah on down through you could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show it expressed jesus christ perfectly exactly yet never giving a secret in full waiting waiting for to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended see god was holding it back so he could show it here and he showed it here and he let a little bit out and a little bit out and a little bit out and then jesus christ came and he was the full reflection of that whole word the whole testament and it was and it was let out a little here and a little here and a little but jesus christ comes on the scene and he's letting out the whole the whole mystery of the old testament was that god would come in flesh but that wasn't the end of the mystery then come forth the bride and and he's letting a little out through luther a little out through wesley a little out through pentecost but holding back the great mystery the great secret to the end time never letting his secret out in full amen but at the end of time amen he would let his full secret out when when it can be comprehended after it's been expressed here and expressed here and expressed here and every type in the bible was expressing it and every character was displaying it and through seven church ages amen they've been building it up amen but at the end of time when it's time now to be fully comprehended amen now he takes the seals and he peels the seals away and he reveals what's been the mystery all along the mystery all along is that god wants to be flesh god wants to be flesh and he was flesh and jesus christ and he's becoming flesh in his bride adam and eve amen pre-typed it they showed it in a time now the whole plan has to be to get the last adam jesus christ and his bride eve back to an eden condition again it's been the whole mystery all the way through but god waits till the end of the time and takes the seal off of his mystery and when he takes the seal off the mystery he brings down a revelation that is the capstone friends it is the light it is the full gospel it is the full word it is the full mystery unveiled and now that mystery is to shine down through the stones which stones this stone right here that mystery has to be displayed right here see when you take water baptism in jesus christ's name you're showing the mystery when when when we believe amen malachi 4 we're showing the mystery i mean when we walk in obedience to this word we're showing the mystery when we denounce trinitarianism we're showing the mystery it's the word that has to be on display and in manifestation brother bram goes on to say he says the revelation it is christ's way of making himself known to his church how the revelation the revelation is how he makes himself known to his church this is so important because what does the message come for to bring us a revelation of jesus christ of the whole mystery christ this title is christ the mystery of god revealed the whole mystery of god is revealed in christ amen and now how does christ make himself known to his church by revelation he says because it's just gradually let loose as it did down through the prophets and till it was perfectly made known that godhead bodily in christ and now the christ in the church is just being made known brother branham now he's been peeling back the mystery and he's showing amen it was god bodily in christ that was the mystery in the old testament name that made known and now the christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of god to take eve back to her right position again with her husband and god is the husband of the church and the church is his bride he says but when christ takes you over he'll express that word right through you he'll express his word right through you when your sister refused to cut your hair anymore it's christ reflecting his word through you not the rule not the law but the revelation of what hair represents and by revelation when the light comes and bounces around and reflects back amen now it's not a struggle not to cut my hair it's a privilege not to cut my hair because i understand why god has given me the revelation it's a privilege for me to act like a gentleman it's a privilege for me to act like a lady amen not by the rule but by the revelation amen and the revelation is the way he makes himself known to his church and when christ takes you over he'll express that word right through you because it's him he is the word and then you can see the expression of christ then you can see the expression of christ i'm going to read two more places his church is himself revealed philip could look at jesus and say show us the father but jesus was the father revealed or expressed and the glory of god was jesus christ and the glory of jesus christ is his bride his church is himself revealed that's why if we can't see him in bride form we're missing him but if we say we have him in bright form but the form that we see him in is not a cut stone you realize if it's not the right stone if it's not the right gem it doesn't give the right reflection not everything that's self-labeled bride is bride but god knows who his bride is god knows where his gems are and god knows how to get him in the right shape and god knows how to pour light into them so that what he gets back is brilliant light a reflection of the light and so it becomes her light what is her light her light is his light reflected through her that's her light what is her light her light is the word that we receive by revelation put into flesh and acted out in this world is her light his church is himself revealed but the revelation came through the blood through jesus christ was the blood of god creative blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelation that's how we know him today is the only way you could know him not say i'm methodist that means nothing i'm baptist that means nothing i'm catholic that means nothing but by the revelation that god has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how listen close how you know it's revealed i'm going to read it real slow not by a label you give yourself not by i'm methodist i'm baptist i'm a message believer i'm bride those are just words it may be so it may not be so it's not the words that means nothing i'm catholic a methodist that means nothing but by the revelation that god has revealed the word to you he is the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses itself through you how did you know it was revealed to abel because of what abel did with the word it's simple it's simple how do you know that it wasn't in cain because what cain did with the word god made it simple and now there's no explaining this away there's no ability to say but brother chad if you knew my past and if you knew the abuse of this and if you knew this no it's not you it's him in you it's not you so you can't be the excuse you can't say well i had a hard life and my dad was authoritarian and it's made me this way and i've got this complex you realize you've missed it amen you've got to be a a jasper stone a polish stone say god amen there's some things that are making it hard for me to reflect this word i'm laying back on your wheel would you just grind some more away because it's got to be you reflecting through me because i can't do it remember we receive how do you know it's a revelation how do you know it's revealed to you amen how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses itself through you it's not a life you live it's a life he comes in and lives through you it comes back down it comes back down to what the word that comes in it really comes down to how the word reflected back out you can have two people sitting here the same message and they'll walk away with two conclusions oh that man is just brother that man's just picking on women [Music] he's just a woman hater that was one conclusion then you have somebody else and says god was speaking to me and showing me a beautiful position i have in his word same message same preacher preaching the same thing that light hits one person amen it's carbon amen or it may be a gym that's not finished being polished yet amen but it hits another person and that other person hears something totally different because they catch more than words that are being spoken but they catch the revelation amen of what god is saying somebody will walk away and say he was you know that that preacher he's always picking on this and he's always picking on that or you could say that was jesus christ trying to show me that i'm not of this world and these world's attractions shouldn't attract me amen i should be attracted to the word and it just depends on what material is there and how long it's been in the master jim's craftsman's hand to shape it back and when the word comes in amen it bounces around and it reflects back in the brilliance of a revelation in the beauty of a revelation amen that's obedience that's a pleasure that's obedience that's a pleasure to watch that's obedience that blesses everybody else amen you can see i mean you can see what's going on in somebody's heart sometimes let's go to matthew chapter 5. we'll just read a couple more scriptures matthew chapter 5 verse 14. jesus speaking the disciples says ye are the light of the world we already read the scripture says god is the light jesus already said he's the light now jesus is looking at his disciples saying you're the light you're the light of the world a city i wonder what city he's talking about a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a can don't put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven let's go to galatians chapter one i want to catch just a couple scriptures and then we'll wrap up galatians chapter one verse 15. paul the apostle speaking that says but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace what did he do he found a gem in the earth and he pulled it out to reveal his son and me to reveal his son and me he separated him from his mother's womb and called him by grace he pulled him out of the earth by grace to do what to reveal his son not to him but in him what did he pull you out of the earth for to do the same thing why did he separate you from your mother's womb why did he call you by his grace to reveal his son in you not to you but in you to reveal the son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem but then but they were two apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again to damascus what did he do when he got separated from his mother's womb when he was plucked out of the earth when he was taken into the hand he didn't go get ideas from men amen but he went to the hand of the master craftsmen who took him into the wilderness in arabia and began to cut the stone because what did he want to do he wanted to cut away all the extra stuff that was built up around the apostle paul to cut him down to his full potential so that god could pour the light in paul and what would he get out of paul he would get brilliance and luster and flashes of light because paul he told paul in acts 13 said i have set thee to be a light to the gentiles i have set thee to be a light to the gentiles that thou should be for salvation to the ends of the earth how was paul light paul was light because he was reflecting the light of jesus christ we know that light comes by revelation even the scripture speaks it this way ii corinthians not done with our bible study we'll add a couple more verses here you can go over when you get home or tomorrow second corinthians 4 and 6. for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ what is that light revelation the light of the knowledge amen in the face of jesus christ let's go to ephesians chapter 1. ephesians chapter 1 and verse 17. that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you might know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints so he's even telling us that your eyes being open is what is a revelation his knowledge is understanding is the opening of the eyes to letting the light in so now let's turn to matthew 6 and read matthew 6. matthew chapter 6. verse 22 the light of the body is the eye now when we read this i don't want you to go to a wrong understanding many times this scripture can be taken and say be careful what you look at because what you see the light of the body but this eye in the bible represents understanding or knowledge or revelation or illumination so read it that way the light of the body is the revelation or understanding is the eye the eyes the eyes of your heart being enlightened your eyes being open eye salve being rubbed in the eyes you read this all through scripture i've given you i said that you might see what is that eyes have to see to see the revelation of the word what is your eye enlightened by by the knowledge of jesus christ so the i is revelation and understanding the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single that word means focused if the eye be focused the whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil the whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore thy light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness god has come in this day to give us the isab to open our eyes so that the the light can come through the understanding and fill our hearts and through the revelation we can receive the light amen and that light can be reflected out by revelation that's why the messages come in this hour amen without the revelation there's darkness if you look back in luther's life luther couldn't live the life we're called to live because of the revelation luther had luther's revelation was limited and in limited revelation there was limited life wesley's revelation was limited limited revelation limited life amen the reflection couldn't be full until the full light came but now the full light has come to take the scales off of our eyes to give us the revelation of the whole mystery so that we can be focused in our body full of light and when we get full of light then the light reflects back in a full manifestation of jesus christ that's why the messages come that's why we read our message books over and over and over again amen because it's not us it's him and us amen it's not it's not what we've done but we've got to focus our eyes single our vision focus our eyes that have been opened down to the word and the word only and fill our hearts full of the word and then reflect back the same brother brahm says in questions and answers in 1964 he said on top of mount zion we'll set the lamb and the city will need no light for the lamb is the light thereof and above the lamb will be the father which is the logos god the great light the eternal light that shines just above the throne and jesus will not be on his father's stone he will be on his throne and the father will hover over the sun which the father and son will be one and then god became material in a man called jesus christ which was a son this son gave his life that he might bring other sons that god might become tangible the purpose was so that god could become tangible how could god become tangible god can become tangible in you and i so that the reflection of our lives is god the way we have conversations at work is god the way we work is god the way we live our life is god the way we dress the way we act the way we worship the the way we raise our families the way a husband and wife conducts themselves with each other what is it it's god becoming tangible to the world so that they can see the light reflecting back out of the city and this light is the light in the whole earth amen we're here to shine forth this light after we've been clear as crystal clean by the blood of jesus christ polished by the hand of the lord shining forth the light from the caption that we received it's got to be a life not a concept not a conversation not a wednesday and sunday club it's got to be a life it's got to be a life in the simplicity and the simplicity of not cheating on a time card at work i mean simplicity of not cheating at school not lying to mom and dad i mean and the simplicity of a husband and wife living in harmony and showing each other mutual respect and honor you see we can say what we want to say we can say we believe all of the word but when abel believed the word you could see it when jesus christ received the word the revelation of what god wanted in that day you could see it when paul received the word you could see it it reflected back the word when we receive the word and we reflect back hatefulness and strife arrogance anger and strife families at odd wrong reflection i say god cut me polish me polish me again lord i've received your light now let the light come out let me single my eye of revelation down on your word isaiah 60 verse 1 says arise shine for thy light for thy light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising in the message future home brother behind says the city with the throne in top and they need no light for the lamb and the lord god is the light thereof see the lord god is the pillar of fire that followed the children of israel through the wilderness and he ascended up on the throne in the perfect kingdoms the kingdom that jesus is to surrender to the father that god might be all and in all jesus sets upon his throne here as our joseph and the king is that light that will be on the top of mount zion and his holy light will flood the entire city when is that supposed to happen friends when is that supposed to happen that's supposed to happen right now don't kick it off right now say lord revelations 21 i see myself there i'm one of those living stones you separated me from my mother's womb you call me by your grace amen and you took me out in the wilderness away from everything i ever knew and you shaped me by this word and you've placed me into a body and now my job is to let the headstone revelation where is the throne at the top where is the capstone at the top what shape is that cloud in capstone what is it then when you turn it to the side head face head of christ what is it it's the same thing it's the full revelation of the word of the whole bible that has come down upon the church and now that whole word is to shine down and fill the city which is the bride and shine out of the city into the earth see there's been a connection made and now the light's got to shine out we can point to the capstone we can point to the prophet who pointed to the capstone the forerunner the coming of the lord the word the opening of the seals the third pool but if it never comes down to abel making the right sacrifice what does it matter anyways you understand we can see we can say we can repeat phrases we can speak words we can we can pair it like coming in i mean it comes in it can come back out amen but if it never manifests the life of jesus christ if this word isn't taken up and collected and put inside of our heart and come back out as honesty when we drive honesty with our spouses uh harmony in our families love amongst the brethren if it doesn't come out the life of the word then we need to go back to the polishing wheel and get polished some more cain cain ended up getting the same word able god but he couldn't reflect it back abel got the revelation in simplicity and in simplicity he could reflect it back i said god don't let me over complicate your word and your purpose what is your purpose that i would reflect you in the grocery store at the gas station at a family gathering at work with strangers with friends that i would reflect you that i would be this city said on the hill that men would see my good works and glorify my father which is in heaven that's the whole purpose made it too complicated sometimes when it should be easy too much too much self too much cloudiness in the in the jasper stone oh but praise god he knows how to get it out he knows how to polish it trials tribulations difficulties distresses are all god smoothing the stone making it perfect to display him let's all stand musicians if you kill him when i read revelation 21 i see something that has to take place on the earth i see something that is taking place on the earth and i see myself as part of it and i say i may not i may not be happy with my performance but it's not my performance that matters it's his performance and i said god take your word take your word shine it in my heart and reflect it back out so that my life is not like cain's life but my life is like abel's man let's sing if we have a song oh i know the time is near where everything that i hold dear lay before the holy consuming fire all my works and all my deeds every prayer set on my knees we'll lay before the holy consuming fire all i want to see is jesus all i want to see is him in me all i want to see is jesus [Music] shining through me hurt in self-inflicted pain [Applause] [Music] words of knowledge in his name and healing hands to touch the lame lay before the holy consuming fire but all i want to see jesus all i want to see is him in me all i want to see is jesus shining through me and hear him say [Music] one [Music] all i want to see is jesus all i want to see is him in me all i want to see is jesus shining through me praise the lord when you look at that beautiful diamond that's a sparkle fire colors as you move it it's amazing but if you ask the diamond what did you do to be so beautiful the diamond would have to confess and say i didn't do anything i didn't do anything i didn't put myself here i didn't make myself a diamond i didn't shake myself and i wasn't the origin of the light the light shined in me and if we could see ourselves that way i didn't put myself in this earth i didn't make myself bride i didn't decide to be a child of god god before the foundation the world made that choice i didn't save myself i didn't pluck myself up i didn't choose myself he did and then he amen through through the abrasive nature of life has taken and polished and polished and polished and polished and if you see a reflection if you see anything beautiful in my life i can take zero credit for it it wasn't what i did amen it's what he did it wasn't what i'm capable of amen i was just laying there in the dirt i was laying there in the rocks amen but he chose me he pulled me out he shaped me he shined the light inside of me i could be stuck in darkness somewhere i could be laying in the mind of denomination somewhere but god has done this work and if you see anything anything in my life that's beautiful anything that's attractive in the nature of christ it's nothing i did it's what he did that's the way i want to live my life i want to live my life in such a way that when people come in contact and then they recognize there's something different there it's shining it's sparkling it's glowing but i have the humility to understand that if there's something beautiful taking place in my life it has nothing to do with what i've done it has everything to do with what he's done with me paul couldn't take credit moses couldn't take credit nobody could take credit brother branham refused to take credit why because it's the revelation it's the reality a real revelation will not allow us to get puffed up amen to become vain and become egotistical with a proper revelation you can't go there because you realize if i had my own way i'd have destroyed my life but i didn't have my own way god had his own way and he wants to take our lives and he wants to make it a beautiful reflection of his word so that my every thought my every action my every word becomes jesus christ jesus christ jesus that's the goal friends that's what he wants to do and i'm just happy with the process you find yourself back in arabia again sometimes we find ourselves back in arabia just rest and relax because the master jim allah just has you in his hand and he's just putting another cut on to get a little more luster out putting you back down and getting a little more and next time we find ourselves in trials and conflicts and stresses it's time to just relax into his hand and say god you want to get something beautiful out of this life i'm yielding to you lord have your way make me what you want me to be your god let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus while we just preach a simple thought lord take your scriptures and see what you want to do is flood us with a light and you've done that through the message lord you've given us your word god we just asked that you would just move out all the impurities that you would cut away lord everything that's not like you that you would shape us into the gems that you want for your crown that you would make us lord that city set on a hill that jasper stone that's been polished to perfection polished by your word polished by conflict polished by troubles and tribulations polished by a life in this world that would polish us to an image you had of us before the foundation of the world god you're not losing us you're not abusing us but you're shaping us into that image you had of us before the foundation of the world god i want to know that i've got the right revelation and you told us how will i know i've got the right revelation when it begins to live its life through me [Music] by the reflection lord we love you we ask that you would take us and mold us into your very image use us for your glory cleanse our hearts purify us and make us shine forth a true reflection of your life in this day in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you saints we love you [Music] i just want to please [Music] to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say well done someday i just want to please the lord be in his will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say well done someday i just want to please my lord be in his will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say well done someday one more time i just want to please my lord be in his will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him stay well done someday [Music] in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face to run in the race how i long to be shot in with
