[0:03] happen to little
[0:04] Henry CU he's not already callous and
[0:07] he's not already tainted by the world
[0:09] and he doesn't have hypocrisy and he
[0:11] doesn't try to look good you know what's
[0:13] going to happen to him the minute he
[0:15] touches that and feels the pain he's
[0:16] going to run back to Mama run back to
[0:18] Daddy throw himself in their arms crying
[0:21] in pain and you know what Mama and
[0:22] Daddy's going to do they're going to
[0:24] have mercy and love and grace for little
[0:27] Henry he's not going to get a weapon

[0:31] going to be told I told you you know
[0:32] what he's going to do he's going to get
[0:33] ointment he's going to get uh he's going
[0:35] to get whatever can soothe whatever can
[0:37] Comfort whatever can take away the pain
[0:39] he's going to get kisses and he's going
[0:41] to get hugs
[0:47] and see if we would just stop being
[0:51] proud and arrogant and try to save face
[0:53] and but when we would just go and touch
[0:55] the stove or do whatever if we would
[0:57] just run back to God and throw ourselves
[0:59] in our arms and said God I've hurt
[1:01] myself again I've damaged myself I've
[1:03] hurt my family God would you save me
[1:05] would you forgive me would you cleanse
[1:07] me oh God have mercy on me God would you
[1:11] embrace me again would you would you
[1:13] tell me it's going to be okay once again
[1:16] and guess what Henry may hurt for a
[1:18] little while it may sting for a few days
[1:20] he may get a little blister he may have
[1:22] something go on like that but by the
[1:24] grace of God he'll know that Mama's
[1:26] commandment is love Daddy meant love and
[1:29] where do I find love after I failed
[1:32] right back at the first place I Found
[1:34] Love and got the Commandment in the
[1:35] first

[2:00] here and Sizzle our
[2:02] fingers and everybody sees the smoke
[2:05] coming off your
[2:07] hand that's the truth friends we can all
[2:10] tell when everything's disjointed and
[2:12] somebody's out of s you can see it we'll
[2:14] put our hand in our pocket and go and
[2:17] we're hurting like
[2:21] crazy but we don't want anybody to know
[2:23] what we just
[2:24] did try to hide it from others try to
[2:27] hide it from God right
[2:30] when what we need to do is say I just
[2:33] transgress the word of God and I hurt
[2:38] myself I need comfort I need love I need
[2:41] healing I need
[2:43] restoration where you going to find it
[2:44] if you don't get it from the body of
[2:46] Christ
[2:48] amen why can't we just come to
[2:52] Christ in his body and say I hurt myself
[2:58] again why can't we find love and mercy
[3:01] and compassion and
[3:04] Grace in God's provided
[3:06] way
