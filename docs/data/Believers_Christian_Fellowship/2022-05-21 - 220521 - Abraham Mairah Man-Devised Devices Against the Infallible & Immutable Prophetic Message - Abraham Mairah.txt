love him you know we love him because he first loved us and if we feel this way about him how must he have first felt about us our love is just a reciprocal love we love him back because he first loved us what a comfort that is to our hearts and god bless you it's certainly good to have you here we've been looking forward to coming to this service again and so glad for those of you who are able to join us all the visitors that are here you're welcome god bless you nathan it's good to see you so we're so happy that you're here with us everybody's come and i just want to say we had a wonderful men's fellowship breakfast for all the brothers that were there we had a wonderful time and we appreciate brother donovan and sister stephanie fisher for hosting that and all those who helped him my brother dan ratliff shared some testimony with us and it was a real blessing we're really edified by that and so appreciate that the youth had a wonderful gathering they had a good time and now we've come to the part we've been looking for to hear from our lord amen to receive from his hand the manna from heaven amen we're looking to our great shepherd to come and feed us his sheep many of you come expecting you'll meet that expectation have you come to receive amen if we've come if we understand what god has taught us in this age and how he speaks to us and how he communicates to his children then we know we've got to reach beyond the veil of flesh because that's just a conduit we've got to pull down from heaven what we have need of tonight but there's going to be a channel standing in the pulpit and if you need something from the lord god can speak through those lips if we believe that we'll receive the benefit of that if we can receive it many just want to remind you there'll be a fellowship in the fellowship hall immediately after the service so all that are here you're welcome to attend we'd love to have you there i just want to say it's been good to serve the lord it's been good to be here last night in the fellowship this morning and we're pleased and thankful and grateful that we could be here again this evening amen we appreciate our brother abraham appreciate the life that he lives and the light that he shines and the ministry that god's entrusted him with we're thankful that he's yielded to that and we're the beneficiaries of that this time amen so we're going to turn the service over to our brother abraham god bless you this thing brother [Music] i give all myself to thee lord here [Music] go here [Music] [Music] god bless you and good evening everybody i trust that everybody is doing fine by the grace of god of course we've never lived for ourselves we live for him amen and special it's a special privilege to live for him and who are we that he called us to live that kind of life you know there is always that popular saying life is short enjoy it to the fullest but i am glad that i don't have that short life i have a long one an internal one and i'm not in a hurry so even if there is a little piercings here and there i know i've just begun and the better the best is here to come so we are really privileged to be in the house of the lord this evening again and um suddenly as the brother said i enjoyed the fellowship with the brother in the morning it was wonderful and of course you people have a charming way of fellowship you are so special so i was telling the brother if it was possible just migrate and become your assistant pastor but he's you know he's a little bit you know he turns things that he said me i'll be your assistant so but we really thank god for the grace he's given us and may we humble ourselves for a while of prayer you're loving heavenly father i want to thank you again for this evening as your servant for the grace you've given us to be in your house and who else are we looking to our eyes are looking to you our hearts are beating lord with expectation waiting to hear from you lord relieving in the days of the voice of god we are thankful that god we are not just speaking in the air as it were we have reality to hold on and i pray that god will come and annoy your servant again and and lord and let it be the lord we behold the unveiling of god in our midst and that regard you'll deal with each individual you are that great shaddai the blessed god who can lord god meet all our needs and i don't care what it is you know everyone about us all of us you know us hello you are able to deal with all our needs and with all our requests and i'm praying that god your princess will be here this evening to bless your people to heal the sick to transform to bring us lord god into close our relationship with you and that's the most important thing that we are here for thank you father lord we give you all the glory and i pray lord as i step out of the way give me the grace to completely do so and the lord you step into this church him and lord have a way with your children in the perfect way that you found it for this day and bless the reading of your word in our hearts in jesus name we pray amen so just turning to our bibles before you sit down i i wanted us to read this uh scripture in the book of jeremiah chapter 18 and i wanted to start from verse 18. then say today come let us devise devices against jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor they can't no counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us might him with the tank let us not let us not give heed to any of his words look at such a plot give heed to me oh lord and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me that now is jeremiah's prayer in answer to that because i'm rejected by reason of the word then give heed to me and verse 20 says shall evil be recompessed for good for they have digged a pit for my soul remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from them so this was the ministry of jeremiah and if there is any prophet who was really persuaded unfold jeremiah was one of them beaten thrown into pits and gentiles would be sympathetic with jeremiah not the jews but i wanted us to compare it with what we we have in the book of amos amos chapter 7. emmaus chapter seven i wanted to pick it from verse um i think let's begin from verse 12. also a messiah say that amos and you remember this a messiah was a priest and a priest is the equivalent of today's pastor a preacher and so he was a priest under the prophetic minister of amos but you see what a pastor is saying also a messiah said that amos oh thou seer go free thee away into the land of judah and there eat bread and there but prophesy not again anymore at bethel for it is the king's chapel and is the king is caught then he answered the almost and said unto a messiah i was no prophet neither was i a prophetess son but i was a han and hardman and the gatherer of comor fruit and the lord took me as i followed the flock and the lord said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel may god bless this world and bless you may be seated and just following up on what we're trying to share yesterday when you fail to get ahold of reality that is beyond a prophetic office when you begin to focus on the prophet that which you valued reaches the time that you begin to see false you begin to fight it you begin to resist it a messiah the priest who was close with amos who worked with amos turns around and said leave this place we don't want hear you prophesy here anymore go to judah by that time remember israel was divided into two the ten tribes versus the the two sorry he's telling the prophet go and prophesy to those not here we don't need you here anymore and look at the kind of response that the prophet is saying he says i was no prophet lord oh god i was no prophet neither was i a prophetess son i never became a prophet i don't belong to a higher rank of prophets i was not a prophet by the floor it was not my intention to be a prophet i never wanted to be a prophet i was gathering scam of fruit i was the herdsman i was looking after qatar so it's not my fault being a prophet it wasn't in my plans i never intended it to be one but i found myself i am one by the lord is calling so i never called myself he called me i never gave him a gift that he gives it back to me he gave me the gift he called me i answered and i am what i am by his own decision not because i want it so today i'm going to speak in the fields of the prophet in the friends of the pastors and in defense of believers genuine believers that is so that where you are you should know in this fluid situation that we are in before we go home how do you place your stand whom do you look to to whom are you accountable whom are you here to please why are you here anyway and i'm talking about man device devices against the inferible and immutable prophetic message let us devise devices against jeremiah who is jeremiah but just because god's mouthpiece did he send himself no did he want to be a prophet no did he train himself no you remember jeremiah was even giving an excuse i'm just a younger man i don't know how to speak lord why did you call me and god said i'm going to be with your mouth i'm going to give you words to speak jeremiah didn't want to do it god told him you have to do it you didn't want to be a believer you cannot even convince me brother brother abraham i wanted to be i even if you say i love the god it's not you who wanted to love god the prophet says you are not the believer it's the holy ghost in you that is the believer so if if you are wrong for being a believer you are a victim and i'm a victim for being a preacher i'm not the culprit because i never sent myself and you never wanted to be a servant of the lord and now don't be ashamed of what you are because of what they say about you don't even feel belittled of course they will belittle you they'll speak a lot of negative words about you but you're not responsible for that you are just what you are because god wanted you to be what you are and the devil wants you to begin to develop some negative sentimental reactions about what you are come on this is a time to know that these things have to be [Applause] so now there is a mystery why this forces are rising up and then if you are living in such a day thank god that you are living in such a day that jeremiah evening almost lived in moses lived in all these great prophets and even brother branningham lived with them so who are you why do you think you'll be an exception should you fret why should you think you're going to freak out you are going to face the music you are the person god all heaven is looking after you glory to god oh brother jack brother chad i wish i was a good preacher glory be to god now if we can go back to the book of jeremiah i want us to examine the way they framed it jeremiah chapter 18 verse 18 there are reasons why they have to smite the prophet with a tank they can't do anything else they will use intellectualism they are good orators good speakers so they smite the prophetic office with the tank because what was dangerous to them also came by the tank the prophet is god his mouth's peace it was the word of god through him so what do you expect the devil to do also smite you back by the tank because what comes through the tank is the enemies what the enemy doesn't want to hear blessed be the name of the lord so he says and they say come so it is a they it's not he say it's a group so you think you should be surprised that there is a group no they said come they they got that together they formed the group they say come and let us devise devices let us devise devices and if if of course english is not my language you know what it defines devices and to device place a strategy some kind of plan plot let us have a scheme or a project designed to receive to counter an artifice a technique that we we the office thereof are going to use to or to speak to use in a way to present that will evoke emotional response from the audience against what they believed was right so some kind of rhetoric rhetorical device that they are devising a device and this device is oral and they are saying and they said come and let us devise devices against jeremiah what is wrong with jeremiah what crime what evil blinded they failed to get ahold of the reality that going beyond jeremiah they stuck at the office of jeremiah they looked at jeremiah as their problem jeremiah became their problem so that's why yesterday we were saying go beyond that office and when you are like when you become like john i mean james and andrew those two disciples of john the baptist who had himself behold the lamb of god and caught the revelation and immediately went beyond the introducer to the introduced they never bothered what they are saying anymore about the other office they had already left glory to god and when you got where jesus is you are in union with him you have gone to see the home you are in heavenly places with him you are lost you are taken away in the inner veil you are with him having communion with him you don't even hear what they are saying about the office this way it doesn't even affect you but you have to know that these devices are there and what should be the standard against them so it's a project certainly made project and it's involving a group and this group must be people who know exactly what the minister of jeremiah is they are convinced maybe they are contemporaries maybe they have grown up in his message they know some history and they can piece this up and piece it up and remember those scientists that popped up in the dream that brother abraham was rehearsing from a certain brother who told him he says when he was saying i'll ride this trail once more i was preaching that reason to somewhere in kenya i'll ride in this trail once more what happened he says there was a bunch of scientists in a room mixing things in tested tubes and they shrugged their shoulders and then my question was why should a bunch of scientists arise on the scene where the prophet is saying i'll ride this trail once more and who is going to ride it once more brother brother will not rise up to ride it it's the spirit that was in the prophet that is upon the elijah's the other brother was with him in a vision that is going to ride again and then the scientists are busy testing researching trying to prove that this man is wrong to smite him with a tank and the prophet he says the next day being a son i preached on science being of the devil but why were the scientists appearing in that dream at the time when he's saying i'll ride in this trail once more and they are there in the room scientists researchers let's piece this and bring this and bring this fault and this that and this didn't happen this happened this was not fulfilled this was not complete this was not done piss this up piss this up and bring out and smite him with a tank prove to their followers that they are following a wrong thing smile jeremiah what has he done he was just got his mouth peace lord of god that's why jesus was not a scientist so when when when the disciples of johnny came jesus didn't put him in his binoculars and maybe is what his microscope to say look at such a man he began well he ascended party isn't that the way they speak about the prophet he began anywhere else now you see being in the in the in the prison he's asking about the very ministry that he introduced and he's sending people to ask are you the one or should we look for another he didn't mention that he said he was more than a prophet and he over all that were born of women no one is greater than johnny baptist positive positive positive because he knows whatever mistake john made whatever fault however many i mean it doesn't mean matter how many people he offended they were offended because heaven sent to him heaven is sent to him glory be to god and heaven cannot condemn you for what it sent you for they only pick the positives and leave the other ones you know our god is so merciful that he does not put a cross on where you fail he just leaves that and takes where you are right and he fills up the patches and says by grace you are 100 percent but even if you are not 100 you can be 40 percent but that tree is not condemned some brought forth is it 40 percent other 60 percent other has a hundred but they are all qualified blessed be the name of the lord so let us come together let us devise devices against jeremiah listen point number one why must we devise devices one the lord shall not perish from the priest the some priests have picked up that some preachers have caught the vision they have stuck with it and whether we work it or not they will continue preaching this so we cannot stop them from preaching what we do is tarnish what they are preaching because we can't stop the law it cannot cease it cannot die from the priesthood called the revelation there are some priests who have called this revelation glory to god and i thank god brother charlie should be one of them that you are still standing with the word as it was handed over preach it man glory be oh god whether the devil wants it or not friends or no friends associates oh no associates collaborators are not collaborators as long as heaven is saying yes as long as somebody here is getting ready to go in the rupture as long as the spirit of god is moving here they are not going to stop some priests there are some priests somewhere who are still standing with the word who are still standing with the message and they know it they never knows it so he wants to tarnish reason number one the law is not going to perish from the priest amen so we must find a way to stop this there are some people who are more serious than we thought there are some people who have known it deeper than we expected there are some people who are going to eat until they have become meat what are we doing how do what do we do about this we must put a stop on this by confusing them and making them busy to compare these such this whether it's wrong or right taking you backwards i'm not going to go back to begin to search about a message whether it's right or wrong and the prophet says you know a true believer you know he goes beyond right and wrong because he has got a revelation that's why john the baptist never was not very clear that's why i said he could have told the disciples who who were with him he said i introduced this man follow this man he didn't say that they had to follow my revelation he remained with them but they too left so why do we remain with you you have said you must decrease he must increase he's the alarm you are the introducer now we are gone the two left the others remain he didn't trust them like we said yesterday so the problem is remaining at the office and so when you remain at office unfortunately for us we are still in this world we can still hear from the reality himself jesus christ he's dealing with us he's in the temple but also we can hear what they are speaking about the office so if you don't know where you are standing they they send the statements the rhetoric the negative statements about the office can begin to work on you psychologically spiritually can try to sort of your spiritual growth you begin to once you begin to question that's what the devil wants taking you back to the drawing board so what the devil has failed is convincing all priests away from the world there are some priests and they are confessing it they know it they know the word this message he's not going to cease from some priests some priests are very serious they are very dedicated to it so what do we do device devices device devices against jeremiah you can call him brother branham you can call him whatever can you call him malakai for or elijah he's also a prophet this age he did his work so now this what the days of the voice so what do we do again to silence the voice device devices because there are some people who have taken this voice very seriously some preachers and not only some preachers but some believers some people are still ready to say amen they are ready to take it regardless and you are not going to convince them out they are anchored they are established so what do we do about these people [Applause] the lord will not perish from the priest that's part one two the council from there wise there are some people who are wise they have identified reality they are not not devil's fools well if i'm a fool there am i full of jesus christ [Music] call me an idiot but it's up to you and down to me i don't care but the council the council that's revelation to the wise the wise of the the age we are talking about is not just your wisdom i'm talking about it the wisdom by revelation that counseling by the spirit the groom counseling the bride and they having communion sweet communion between them there is that sweetness they are not fools they are ready to be deceived they are not cheap they are not going for achievable popularity they know where they are standing they are wise they are the wise virgins they have got oil they keep checking themselves all the time am i fit am i fit is there a problem can i fix something god jesus come and fix me up fill me up refill me refill me the hours on the watch out they are wise you are not going to follow them they know who they are waiting for they know whom they are serving they know where they are going so those with wise people what do we do with them they are not foolish virgins that can relax and have some good time well well well um sometimes you have to put these things from the what they want aside and enjoy life you know and they don't have time for that they are watching their garment they are trimming and feeling and checking and wading and observing and the devil knows you are there so you think that judas carrier today was not supposed to be here they are supposed to be here that's why the worst enemies of the message are the ones who were once message believers they know all the weaknesses and you know he went so close to jesus until he could know how jesus eats because they were eating in the same blood gotten used to him they know so much about him and they have they can convince the people i mean you could mistake him i mean peter to be the person who would be you know betraying jesus not judas he was very smart smart guy humble respectful very close attentive but with a hidden agenda so i mean we are supposed to be wise virginis isn't it so that's why he is saying the council will not cease from the wise now listen neither the word from there perfect so the prophetic message still lives the tips the books are there and you cannot change it i mean you can tell someone he made errors but people are able to go and sit and listen oh i'm not going to be just deceived so easily and so cheaply i was bought by a very expensive price so you are not going to deceive me very cheaply i'm very expensive glory be to god so what do we do what do we do about these three classes of people the priest is strong with the word and then the wives are also there still wise and the prophetic message is still there so what do we do this device divides us come and let us smite him who the prophet target source of the message source of the word the revealed word when we target the prophet not the priests not the wise ones the prophet jeremiah let us smite him with the tank and let us not give heed to any of his words that's the whole thing so we must create an excuse of not obeying his word by making it appear false that is the device devised by the enemies of the world to fail these avenues but the problem is i think sometimes you have to sit and sympathize with the devil because today through elect he has already left his office you speak a lot of words about his office as we said yesterday he's beyond there and you're not bothering him blessed be the name of the lord so now you have to look at this because it is very interesting that in every age saturn will always use the people which people the intended beneficiaries of the god-given message to resist and fight the same so they devise devices smite him in the tank use intellectual reasoning against the message use some scientific research methodists that are convincing appealing to people's communications well i don't depend on communications that's why james i mean jew decided when i thought about writing to you about the common service i had to package it with that you also contend for the faith that was once delivered today saints so that faith makes you not common although you may have common salvation come you may be a common message believer and people will think well he's just a common man what does he know like maera here who is not even educated i mean just come just communicates he will finish him appealing to the communists psychologically right to silence this message make sure you are armed with all sufficient information or data so that whoever wants to rise in the face of the message you are capable of silencing him with some negative quote like i said yesterday what was in written in what we read in the bible is john saying i'm not elijah are you that elijah no but jesus comes and says if you are to receive it this was the elijah that was to come so that was for a bracketed special group of people who are designed to receive it the rest will end on the letter we had him verbatim it is on tape it's in the message book i can read you them what oh so what the prophet himself said can throw so many people but what about that which was revealed by the reality that he introduced so who do we believe now this is the time so if you are going to go by negative courts there are so many and i don't deny that one day and god permitted them to be there [Music] so don't argue oh he said it is he saying this he's saying okay the message is broken it's not open the seams are not they're there they are broke but not the public there like he said do you believe me to be god is prophet i mean god is servant he was addressing to people he's saying that many times do you believe me to be god is prophet or i mean body servant because others we're not going to receive him as god is perfect others will receive him as god is servant they are comfortable with that amen when you say you're a servant it's okay brother but if you were to say a prophet thank you for correcting and correcting yourself but he was not correcting himself he was addressing different categories of people it just depends on who you are it depends on what they have put in you what a receptor it's just like we have the same size of memory card but it doesn't hold the same data this one is one one gb another one is 100 gb another one is 62 gb so if we put in 128 gb and then another one has got just 5 gb so when the data is too much i can't believe that that is beyond me and you can't blame the man he can only handle 1gb for you you are designed you may look like you have a very small you know memory card but it's having 128 gb this one has one gb and you went to the same shop so you can receive much more much deeper this one receives but little what makes common sense not revelation deep things brother don't take me into that i don't blame you i only pray for you because you can't help it but i mean you can buy by faith and the bible says you buy and don't sell [Laughter] glory be to god you know there is what they call a pdf isn't it you have you have a message it has come to any box but you don't have the pdf reader so if you don't have a pdf free reader you are not going to receive the message that's you are not going to understand it you are only going to have it in your inbox but without a pdf reader to open the file you are going to remain message you received but which message what is in the message what's in the message you don't know it that you have received it okay i have received the message i believe the message that's the problem that's where the difference is so let's use intellectual intellectualism by the way god intestinally uses a seventh grade preacher with very poor english and this age we are having sophisticated well-educated preachers i emphasize with you people who are very educated i'm not it's not a crime god bless you but don't try to bring that in this you are going to knock out your brains let's use intellectual reasoning against the message use some scientific recites some methods of silencing this message so that we make sure the people are you know our team is armed with sufficient informational data that will silence those who try to rise up those priests who are unceasing in the world try to bang them down try to draw them into arenas of discussion and argument just come on let's talk take it over and that's where the devil invited eve you know come to my arena of discussion and i will show you something that adam your pastor has never showed you i give you an alternative view [Music] i'm not going to dictate anything i'm just giving you just for your information i know you're a brilliant guy i know you can handle this you are not a dummy i i know that you are able to challenge me if i'm wrong i will accept if you are wrong you accept let's just have a discussion arena somewhere away and you go to those websites that are forbidden huh and then the others were why i left the message why i left william ranam you left william branham thank you so much for leaving him you were wrong [Applause] so you were with me and me i was with jesus i'm still with jesus [Applause] why i left the message so you just heard the message me i am the message so we are two different people i am the message manifested so i can't leave the message and i have no time to talk with those who have left the message because i can't leave the message i am the message so you are right brother continue me i am the message behold i send you elijah so the package was mine so elijah was a servant to bring me the message it wasn't his liver leave william branham aside that man is he's innocent that that guy that is thing of god is innocent leave god his thing aside there afford that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called a son of god so it was a thing being used of god to redeem you and me he's innocent do you know that he wanted also to smoke when he was challenged by a woman he couldn't he was a prisoner but he wanted to smoke and then whoosh [Music] he couldn't do what he wanted to do even he couldn't he wanted to take a whisk he couldn't drink he was a prisoner he wanted to break the word he couldn't break it and god said why because there is a work for you to do when you shall be older and the worker was to receive the message for me so i am standing here today in the defense of william branham leave that man alone let him rest in peace he has done his work he has gone stop talking about him let's talk about jesus he's here talk about the bribe talk about him what manifested talk about rupture talk about going home talk about new jerusalem talk about millennia talk about the bride ministry it's because there are a bunch of failures [Applause] but there are some people who are going home they are going right home they are moving on their movies on for the bride [Applause] so stuck at the office devising devices and there are a lot of websites why do you go there just the heading alone should tell you this is the danger zone this uh this is a wicked device devised against me because i am the message devised against me and my groom jesus christ because that man whom they are talking about the name william branham is is just the name of a man a thing that god used to bring the message and the message was to prepare me for him i am not mrs branningham her message jesus christ [Applause] [Music] so stop knocking making that useless noise i don't have time for it glory be to god so this is what is going on and the devil is always the liar you know the devil is always a liar but there are those who believe the lies of the devil you know and then what one thing is they are saying let us smile him with the tank they are very good speaker slice shrewd satell all that those were the the the characters of the serpent and that's what i was preaching about in the message is the god is provided standard against the mamba at kadesh bania there is that member popping up in the wind again in the way and wants to kill but there are those who are going to overcome the friends of the prophet they are there oh glory be to god now here is smite with the tank that's first step second step do not give heed to any of his works it's a disease that you know disarms people from leaving out what they know what they believe what god called them to come to you know this is the truth but i mean like you look at your wife you know i'm supposed to love her i'm the only husband she has but you don't even love her you look at your husband he's the bible paul who was not even married i was asking the church one time why should a man who is not married tell you wives love your own husbands husbands love your wife i mean who will love your wife for you who do you want to have your wife with glory be to god things that you know smile cherish encourage tell her the best words needs to hear tell her she's beautiful why should another man tell your wife you look cute you look beautiful and you are there from january to december you just say dumb until when another man tells her it's like he's hearing tanks so i am beautiful oh you pay your tithes i mean who will tell you to pay your time what don't you know you know it rejoice at the word you come here in the church and you're seated like a brick what will make you happy if jesus doesn't make you happy whom will you receive again who is better than jesus what makes you happy while others are frowning at him who should rejoice at him we should receive him who should praise him who should worship him this is a time to rejoice it's our time to be happy we are in heavenly places and you are talking about rapture do you know what rapture means extreme joy you are not going to go in the rapture when you are silent and sad and [Applause] rejoice until the devil gets confused you have a pain you are happy you are sick you are happy you have problems here you are happy and the devil is confused what do i do to make this man sad because you are in the rupture you are in the process you are going home the devil wants you to be gloomy who will tell you to rejoice to be happy i mean who is here you come to meet whom you come to me to jesus jesus is here jesus is your husband which which man doesn't want a wife who smiles for him [Applause] and you say you are the wife of jesus and you can't smile at the word you can't rejoice at the word you are not free you are bound you are bogged down you are held you don't exercise you are reported something is wrong we are the people we are the subject of the devil the devil is talking about us that's why he's fighting the word you are the reason you are the reason the devil is still upset you are the idea the reason there is a lot of devices going on and and moves and talks and and and and plans because you are here so you should thank god that you are still positive with the world glory be to god i wish i was a better preacher [Applause] let us not keep heed and you come to church and you are there sleeping dozy and you are not pre you think you are not helping the devil to fulfill the scheme number two [Music] come go to church but don't give heed and the devil will you know you know pat your back and you know like you know i know some of you know how hogs are pigs you know they love being wrapped and especially when they have some you know and then and the devil comes and rubs your back and makes you so comfortable saying now you can sleep sleep please please i beg you sleep a bit i don't want you to listen to this sleep and you go back home in the night there is no sleep there's no sleep scheme smite the message smite the prophet smite the office with the tongue [Music] define him belittle him just like brother branham in the message taking sides with jesus he underlines the underscores the fact that if sanhedrin was always bent on one thing to belittle jesus to make him non-relevant irrelevant yet they knew he was much much much more powerful than all their seven denominations put together in the sanhedrin he was giving them sleepless nights they had to explain why this man is performing all these miracles and they don't have it in their system so they it's just the elves of that that is easier said isn't it very easy but it was a statement of envy do not give heed to his words after smiting him with a tank makes you like you are accustomed you are used to the message you know the message you know it let me tell you every time you come to church you hear something new every time i read this bible i i begin to realize i don't know it he just keeps revealing himself every other time he becomes sweeter blessed should be the name of the lord let us not give heed to any of his words and jeremiah is saying lord now that i am rejected and that is my subject the subject is god giving heed to the voice of him that is rejected and you will be the most happy person in this world if you are rejected because of the word if you are maligned defined abused segregated because of the word you think it was easy for brother branham to stand one man against the whole world against the denominations what pressure all the friends and he you can feel him his heart when he was speaking standing in the gap and he says letters are coming in every day i used to have all the confidence in your ministry i no longer have it when you say this you're saying it this you attacked this you preached this we have withdrawn we walked out of your service and we went home letters coming from friends you think it is not pain it depends you think we we we want to preach it in the way that people are hot or we enjoy when people leave the church who would enjoy that you don't know the pain like brother abraham says i would rather get skinny than you want to offend even one of you but he says i can't help it like i said earlier he was a victim that's good something what the prophet says here you know these are things that i want you to underline one the reason the devil is rising the storm raising the storm is because the law has failed to perish the word has failed it has prevailed this is what the devil didn't expect some of you people have gone through this experiences some of you are survivors of terrible episodes survivors of ministers who have left the message and they never expected you to die with that but you have survived by god's grace you have strived of you you are moving on and the devil said what do i do this guy is still there that woman is still adamant oh it has failed to perish from their hearts the world is still there they're still holding on and friends when coffee they came i didn't know how to come back here but i've come here to say press on hold on if we don't meet again let's let's hold on let's press on i have nothing else and i can tell you let this word not fail from your heart and the act the counsel from the wise is unceasing they have to you know they want to mask him off from those who want to listen to those who have weak words of wisdom encouragement ministries that can encourage that can edify and embolden the bride they want to silence those voices and that's why the devil when he fights you he even doesn't want you to have a friend one brother was telling me brother abraham i said yes you are the why are you a friend of brother church and he called me from the u.s here i said why are you also not a friend of chad and why are you asking me oh brother abraham with your ministry why do you attach yourself to a man like that i said which ministry which ministry do i have it's the minister of jesus christ and jesus christ is in him jesus christ is in you he's in you he's in you in everybody so which ministry do i have and then there are those who are saying we blame brother chad for highlighting mahira so who is highlighting you who is supporting who we can't help it we are just attributes of god who can't help coming together it's the fellowship of the attributes and it's automatic you are not going to stop it so they want to fight you but they don't even want you to have a friend and yet for them they have friends why do you have friends and you don't want me to have a friend you have those people you are saying come there is a company that is a come let us devise why should we do so i have a brother so that i said brother chad come let us stand with the word let us press on let's move forward god bless you brother chester there must be a friend i said brother chester don't give up stan stand for the word fight on i can know from uganda that i have rather done rightly faster friend i have brother chad i have i mean why not jesus paid for it and and who are you to ask me about it i heard from heaven and i'm comfortable by the anointing of the spirit from heaven that that is a real genuine brother so who are you to tell me negatives about him so who is propping up who how would have known each other he wouldn't have known me if jesus had not called me blessed be the remark of the lord so they want to silence any counsel anybody that would be of edification to you who could support you who could speak a word that encourages you they want to cut you off from any brother that has a gift that has a ministry and a brother to isolate you like the political world using sanctions blessed be the name of the world these are the demons we are dealing with and they are very active i mean when i come here to preach i don't preach for brother chad we are just servants i i i nicknamed him a bowl-headed about anyone robin from africa it's a ball anyone bought the headed one so if i bring you someone sandy witches no problem you don't have to ask whether my beak is sanitized or not as long as the world is coming glory be to god so the word from the prophet the prophetic message he is proving that it's unstoppable the fountain is inexhaustible so look for the purported force with the ring and the neck negatively expose it to the public as any fit so give me something that is more fit than the message show me a ministry that is more vindicated than that of malachi 4. give me even a quote of that vindication bring it bring it a bunch of honeycombed so-called great men having nothing empty how dare you i am more than convinced too late i'm gone i'm taken try elsewhere oh glory be to god let's look at something here you know the prophet comes here in his quote he says i think it's in the message um [Music] identified the identified christ of all ages which he preaches i think in 1964 he says what is it when a man breaks through that veil into the shekinah glory now not then now the world calls him a fanatic oh are you ready to be called a fanatic if you are not ready don't break through you want a name you have a name to protect you want to be defined by the nobility the noble you know among the nobles of the world to have a test among a society so you are highly esteemed a man of a woman of renown among the economies of society okay your heart you don't have to break into but if you break into this kind of glory now the world will call you a what fanatic they can't see what's wrong but behind there there is no beauty of him you lose your beauty when you go there and he says he might not pronounce his words right and that's what the prophet was he might not dress just right that's what john the baptist was in a scheme he might not dress any cloudy clothes she might not rest the way they think she owe to now he brings in the sisters also it may be but you see inside behind that by your skin behind that human skin in there is the shekinah glory in there is the power in there is the word in there is the shoe braid and the shaking of glory which is the light that makes that that that makes that makes like that ripe ripens the grain he continues here he says and until you come in behind that barge skin until you get out of your old skin old nature character your comfort zone where you are living in a level of acceptance in the realm of positive perception then you come out of your own skin your holy thoughts let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus you see you are all the thoughts you leave them you are all cribs all the cribs and you come into the princess of god then the word becomes a living reality to you living reality not some dead all the acarion that you keep belching some funny smell the word becomes a living reality then you are awakened to the kind of glory now listen then the bible becomes a new book then jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever when the bible becomes a new book jesus becomes the sin now when the bible becomes a new book you preach new sermons new understanding new life everything becomes new and the people don't want the bible to become a new book they want to preach from the holy bible that is still sealed only way of presenting the message don't don't take me out of my comfort zone don't talk about these things brother don't brabram says the bible became a new book for him when the seals were opened the bible became a new book and when jesus came you know the bible became a new book that's why he broke the sabbath the rest day to bring rest he broke the rest to the body to bring rest to the soul which also eventually became rest to the flesh because he told a man who has been bound sick fought eight years and said rise up take your bed walk go home on the sabbath day and then he's freed even physically but the other sabbath other rests you will come and go and it was not resting here comes the real sabbath on the suburb and the new sabbath breaks the old sabbath and gives you the sabbath glory be to god and that's where the problem that in the ministry of jesus they had a problem with jesus let's go quickly here in the book of luke i just want to finish quickly i'm not even knowing the time here now luke chapter 13. verse 31 and the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and the path hence for herod will kill you this is exactly what they told amus get out of here the king is going to deal with you if you stay here they tell jesus get out from here go away herod will kill you and jesus is saying unto them go in and tell that fox and you know a fox will always hold when it has closed the eyes in the dark blind holders making a lot of noise that they cannot batteries with anything real we are not a bunch of holders holding making noise for nothing when i say hallelujah it has substance when i say praise god i i feel it from deep enemy when i sing a song it has substance go and tell that those bunch of empty holy beasts they are making a lot of noise for nothing blinded go and tell him behold i cast out devils i do chores today and tomorrow and the third day i shall be perfected this was prophetic because today is the third day perfected but they were saying leave this place don't prophesy here don't perform your miracles yeah we don't want you here and you'll find that jesus they always faulted him the problem with the sanhedrin was that and a general jewish populace was that he was breaking the gnomes and the traditional way of doing things breaking the sub-path i think that's what they always tell me one brother one brother told him brother brother maher i have one problem with you i said so you are not preaching the orthodox generally accepted way i said can you give me a book on how to preach so you people have got some syllabus that preachers should follow this is like you know they wanted to arm david with some kind of special um and everybody says i'll go in the way that i know as long as it works take take however you want you are new ideas i'll go the way i know god called me to do it if you can only punish it brother and bring it this and what did this but you people you had in this armor and goliath is here 39 days you you are going backwards and now you are trying to tell me i must put on your armor what have you done with your armor [Applause] [Music] well this is the way we do it brother this is the way we don't go the sides we always preach it like this and we cover it like you know some little mother mother hen trying to tell the chicks cluck crack crack this is the way we eat this is the thing don't go this way just with scratch scratch here be done and you just follow my data feet and eat no go the way god called you we are not the same i told him brother if i preached the way he wanted me to preach you know the results that is a brotherhood come all the way to see me and he's telling me brother god is using you but you have to change your way of approach and preaching things like this if you can just adjust here and i said brother if i had adjusted you would not have seen the supernatural that you have come to ask me about it that's what i am correct me if i'm wrong by the word not by some kind of ecclesiastical idea so that's what is what is the problem he broke on the sabbath and introduced the sabbath and brought sabbath to the man who was in trouble but he broke the sabbath to bring the sabbath on the sabbath day okay so brother abraham also became you and everybody was saying no no no no no we cannot receive you now it's finished it's kaput fine leave me alone and the brother says as long as god stood with me all men have forsaken me that he remained with me [Applause] more comfortable isn't it i'm more comfortable when he remains blessed be the name of the lord so i want to just come to this let me leave some of the things here this the pharisees always wanted to intimidate but he was more than a match for them he was god and i i sometimes wonder people can get so blinded as to think that this message can be silenced this message is good why are you a mere creature and you think you can silence this the prophet said as long as there is even one man surrendered total in the hands of god he is the majority you are not going to stop that man so we continue a little bit here but i want to come something here and and i want us to go back and examine these statements with they are telling amos a messiah the priest a seasoned preacher a contemporary of the prophet i know him in and out and it's the one telling him get out of bethel what does bethel means the house of god you are chasing the prophet of god from the house of god and you know what he says this is no longer a house of god although it's called the house of god but is the king's chapel private prayer business that's what they are telling amos where are we ready now chapter 7 is saying you see are you prophet free go into the land of judah there you eat bread and prophesy there but don't prophesy again better for it is the king is chapel and it's the king is caught something sounds something familiar in the new testament here let's open our bibles and compare this with first corinthians blessed be the name of the lord first corinthians chapter four and let's look at i think verse seven for who maketh thee to differ from another and what has thou that thou did not receive whatever you have you just received amen if they are bright if you are intelligent if you are beautiful who made you beautiful so you think you applied and god gave god some favor to make you beautiful and charming oh if you're beautiful who made you beautiful god if you are handsome who made you honest of god if you're bright what you call smart how many of you smart why is it that in the class there are some of those people who fail they try they study they fail and for you are always passing who made you smart what weren't you just given by god and if you are a preacher like me who may be a preacher did you go to any training are you are you very intelligent is it because you are so special god is able to make preachers and believers out of stones and then the devil has made some people to reach a point where they think they they they they are i mean indispensable if i left the message it will crumble sure brother if i leave you a church that church is going to be shaken so are you mr earthquake maybe i'm not a good speaker you'll forgive me but that's what i am i don't know how to bring it english is not my language so i'm not smart i'm not bringing things in a smart way i'm very crude very raw what do you have that you didn't just receive what do these people think they have that they need to receive what intelligence what understanding what revelation what knowledge what wisdom what experience and then the devil always wants to create a difference he you are not comfort if you have a problem you are not comfortable being in unison in common in you know having things in common people want always to deviate to be special to be different different even from the prophet from the message i think here he was wrong i have a better idea the message according to brother so and so preacher so and so according to my understanding who gave you that little brain of yours who gave you even the breath you are using to speak just like you know danielle told beerus he says the very god in whose hands thy breath is thou has not glorified can imagine god who is holding your breath in his hands if he was just to shake it off you are finished you are gone kaput when is the barrier arrangements when are we finished i was hearing a brother testify i think it was brother down and he mentioned something i said i i my flesh thing you know my skin thing then when he said someone said i'm here to correct the prophet and in a few times he's gone correct the prophet a divine interpreter god called god chosen god ordained god equipped god vindicated how dare you even if you were the devil himself the devil even saluted whatever that little small man who said the devil would respect so who are you i'm smart i'm not a a fool sure well pasta myra has come with an attack on america yes we are not americans we are not africans we are christians and if you are an american you are in the wrong place you are you are lost you are only american physically but not in the spiritual realm i have my rights to my mind to my thinking to my ideas you have your rights devil given but not god given the church of god is built on revelation not rights [Applause] so the devil wants to make people devise devices that make them different from the prophetic message brother don't be one of them sister don't so far so good you've made it you are here let's continue a bit he's saying we are in the book of corinthians i think as well wait he says for who maketh thee to differ from another so if we made you different it's god who made you different if he has not made you different don't try to be different and what has thou what have you got that thou did not receive now if thou didst receive it why does thou glory if you just received it why are you bragging about it as if thou has not received it as if you made it yourself you even don't know how you came you don't know how you are behaving in your mother's womb let me come to this final point verse 8 now listen to verse 8 now you are full now you are rich and you have reigned as kings without us who was the one speaking this is paul paul the messenger to the ephesians and he's saying because i'm out of place i'm not there you are full you are rich you have reigned as kings you've taken over the temple the house of god to become chapels this is the king's chapel it's no longer bethel this is my church don't preach that stuff here i don't want that don't believe in the cities being open don't believe in this don't believe this i don't believe this i don't want this here who is speaking a king he has a chapel chasing away the message chasing away the prophet we don't want you here this is no longer bethel this is now the king is chapel we are reigning as kings we used to subscribe fully to the message when we were still young purpose and and anchored but now i'm established i know am i sure enough don't worry prophet back to the bible hallelujah back to the bible can you show me a bible without a prophet back to the bible a fool you read the book of jeremiah a prophet isaiah a prophet daniel a prophet ezekiel a prophet so show me a bible without a prophet i read genesis prophet jenny is exodus prophet leviticus numbers deuteronomy a prophet moses i mean judges i mean tell me anyway first somewhere prophet second so which bible is without a prophet back the bible back to the bible that's a statement of a deceived fellow and i'm not scared to say that because you heard this bible in your hands and you didn't even know baptism in jesus name you were still baptized dedicated to the pagan gods of rome trinity god the father that zeus got their son bow given new names dedicated to the three deities of pagan rome in the name of christianity you were still a pagan wrong believer under guys until the message came [Applause] and then you want to throw away the message and say i'm back to the bible when did the message take you away from the bible so you can see the tactics of the enemy confusing the vulnerable and that's why they are concentrating on the office of the prophet they don't want to go beyond that office because once we succeed in demonizing weakening and you know belittling and silencing that off office then the purpose of god for this age is finished the devil knows how important that office is he never knows it but the problem is the office is already done its work so you are fighting a shadow the man is resting he's gone he's waiting for me [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord so we have this problem and then he says it's i mean it's very evident that the absence of the messenger paul made the corinthian pastors kings and paul is saying now you have reigned as kings now you are full now you are rich you have the money i mean i was talking to one brother in africa you know that these people here are buying preachers from africa because they have the money buying them out of the message i said how can you be so stupid huh give me her i mean which money will you give me to sell the word it goes on to show most of these people had no revelation because revelation is not about revelation is not brainwashed but they are using money they are building people houses they are building people they are buying them vehicles if you denounce william branham i'll give you this i'll give you this because they are rich they are full they are now kings they are taking over god is you know god is sanctuaries and trying to own them and pocket them and have come here in america to tell them i know some of them will listen to this let them know that they are not going to chase the message even out of america and succeed they will not will not chest they will deceive some fools the simple ones the greedy ones the blinded ones but the bride is not going to be deceived glory to god hallelujah you see you begin to turn bethel into chapels of kings don't want to start don't want and then one brother was saying brother i had wanted to invite in my church but um when i had this someone that you preached i said i said you have done me a very good service i don't even want to come to your place i don't want to to waste my strength there say god bless you you have done me a very good i'm not looking for places to preach i am a pastor i have a home church i'm not dying to preach in anybody's church i've come here because i'm a friend of bcf not because i'm dying to preach here so kings chapel kings they have reigned as kings they have great power and who made them kings the message who made them popular let me see how did they get to know those men in africa the message how did they get the addresses the message how did they get their contact because of the message and now they are using that popularity to fight it praise god but it's going to be people that are not going to be deceived and i'm not going to be deceived and i believe you are not going to be deceived glory be to god because that is a enemy device devices but there is a device from above let me tell you something as i finish let's go back to prove to you that before they came up with the thought of devising this god had already devised a device against them before they came up to devise the devices [Applause] let's find that the goddess device in jeremiah 18 also they didn't know that before they came up in jeremiah 18 18 to devise their devices in jeremiah 18 verse 11 let's see what god is saying now there are four go to speak to the men of judah and of the inhabitants of jerusalem saying that say the lord behold i frame evil against you and devise a device against you so before they could devise their devices god has already devised a device against those who device devices i think you better come and take over glory be to god behold i frame evil against you and he says and devise a device for him he has one device he doesn't have devices these ones have devices but for him he has one [Laughter] glory to god against you return ye now everyone from his evil way and make your ways and you are doing good and you know what they say and they say there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices ah we'll walk after our own devices and we will everyone do the imagination of his evil heart adamant stiff-necked cross the line of mercy they don't want to repent but before they devise their devices god has devised his in other words god is never taken off god don't sit there in your home and you sympathize with god [Laughter] so mr god now what are you going to do no glory be to god god is going to prove his word and he has already done it and he'll do it and over and over and over and he'll vindicate and you'll take us home and and there's going to be a bride and there is already bride and there's going to be a people that are going to stand undefeated and deceived with revelation anchored they don't care what comes or where it goes what they are going to lose what they are going to gain is not their problem who leaves them who stands with them is not their problem when they saw my own wife my own husband my own friend sister brother my relatives that's not my problem i am not the savior salvation is of the lord i'm only going to say lord help me stand [Applause] i pray for my brothers i'll pray for my friends i love them i don't hurt them but to convince me away from this impossible romans 8 comes there says i'm persuaded more than persuaded and paul says that neither death nor life things present things that are to come if it is sickness if it is trouble if it's persecution is it nakedness is it a peril nothing shall separate me from the love charity i'm hooked i'm taken it's done saturn you are wasting your time blessed be the name of the lord and i want to tell you god is here to take care of your every name here glory oh god why there is a a a holding up a reducing of the number yes but that is even better when jesus was to feed five thousand he needed five pieces of bread and they gathered twelve baskets because there has to be twelve testimonies to the 12 tribes of israel but when he was defeated the fourth house and he needed seven and they gathered seven baskets why in the shadow for the seven church ages but then last of all when they were in the sheep and jesus is warning them about the they live in the bread of the denominations they say is it because we have not carried bread they remember they had only one bread so seven plus five 12. in other words every disciple was represented by a piece of bread but eventually the 12 disappeared into one so time is coming that revelations and ministries are going to disappear into one the minister of jesus christ personalities and big men big this big that are all going to disappear into one that's all you need the word is the healer the word is the blessing what is your security the word is your you know you are everything he is everything the inexhaustible fountain no wonder the sun is stoppable and they were saying what do we do the world conditions coming conditions coming i mean we are not preachers who are going to dry out this is an inexhaustible inexhaustible fountain the world will keep coming because you are healed still here god is working on you and make sure you take the word and you are going to overcome the death i don't care how many devils are coming i'm not scared of the future you shouldn't be scared of the future that's why he came that's why he came down glory be to god so as i finish as we go to pray i think i've left so many things here but there is this inexhaustible nature of the world founded and it has a guarantee that no matter how much it's fought overlooked rejected it will always be there producing that water for those who are thirsty it will always be there and if you are here you have a problem you have sickness you have got trouble you have got this don't think you are going to look for a certain messiah certain great man try somewhere the word in you will take care of your every need sometimes we had been thinking i think brother so and so was they want to do it brother swan so was the one to do it brother son so was the one to do it and then the very person you sought was very strong in the word collapses and then they weak you you are there i mean why would god take away the powerful strong minister of brother branham and he takes him away and leaves you because that which is in you must mature and that's why jesus said it's expedient for you that i go because if i don't go the confeder will not be manifested it's very important that i physically disappear that i can come in so this man physically goes away that the one he introduces comes into us so that we don't have to keep looking for william branham pray for me brother and so pray for me let me ask you one question as i go to pray you think who is going to pray for your wife better than yourself you can send many prayer requests on forums and you know but we'll pray for your husband better than yourself pray for your daughter better than and then you just send the message and relax and sleep the brethren are praying how is you are you even in 10 of them and praying make prayer your habit your life wake up and pray and seek good all that we have is enough but only waiting to be unleashed by that trigger of your personal revelation and rising up to claim amen not as an amateur but as a son of god a daughter of god because i mean god has no big ones and small ones like the prophet says he doesn't have grandchildren who is going to work for your rapture who is going to wake you up and say come on drop your time daring daddy wake up we are going in heaven no it will be all whoever will be going will be going so work out your salvation work it out there is not a part it's already done yes but prayer why do you think jesus prayed did he need you to pray but why did he pray and why shouldn't you pray why should you seek god these demons here that are morality moving around the only way you watch out against them is through prayer being in contact with your god a personal relationship with your god until you have him where you wherever you are in your office you feel his princess in your house you feel his princess you are in the kitchen you feel his princess wherever you are that's the challenge and he gives you special grace he is going to equip you to come to that but let there be that willingness that fast that craving that that desire the prophet says he's even wanting to hear you call him on the scene he's he's yearning to hear you call him now we are remaining with one challenge if you think this message is true let that god come and show himself yes and this is a very ripe time for him to come and prove that the message the vindication the anointing the power didn't go with malachi 4 he's actually more here now god doesn't do what he's going to do in the prophet god reveals what he's about to do through his servants the prophet surely the lord god shall do nothing but first revealeth the mystery of what he's going to do through his servants the prophet so the prophet just revealed what god is going to do so the doing time is now [Applause] this is the doing time and where is he going to do it through you in you we are here to glorify him we are here to prove the devil a liar we are here to prove the skeptics that they are wrong we are here to prove them that their message is real and that the devil is a liar and that we are going home come on that's why you are here that's why it is you who is still here not your father not the other one not the other one or the other one leave the other ones alone you are here and this is your time may god bless you let's stand up oh hallelujah think about it friends as we humble ourselves and close our eyes you can feel his princess i can feel his premises is here anything can happen i mean i don't even need to tell you to do what you can tell him what you want done in your life and believe in your heart i'm just going to pray together with you if you want to be remembered in prayer please just lift up your hand and we pray loving heavenly father i want to thank you for this evening i want to thank you god for this message oh god what shall we say heavenly father what is that we said what the lord you chose the vessel he suffered he was abused he was rejected but he stood against the whole world against all the demons to bring this message the way he wanted it to come and we are here the privileged recipients of the same why would we let you down why would we be half baked in the time of maturity in the time that the sons and daughters of god are supposed to be manifested why would we have to become temples of spirits when the heaven is full of the holy spirit why would we be weaklings moving around as if heaven is not behind us why would we be beggar why should we struggle with the demons and spirits and sicknesses and weaknesses as if you never suffer uncover and pay their price quicken our faith quicken our hearts quicken our understanding revive us lord come down lord god and take over i pray for your children here lord where is the lord god of elijah this is the time lord god to come and prove yourself come and heal the sick transform lord change our lives bring us to what you want us to be and lift us higher to that table and of faith where all of things are possible for them that believe oh heavenly father i dedicate your children into your house i pray that god will have mercy and strengthen those who are on the battlefields many places battered ridiculed hatted and feel like where should i turn may they you feel your presence may your hand reach out unto them encourage them strengthen them for soon and very soon we feel they pull we know going home has come help us to be found ready to be phony faithful and visit the pastor here and all the preachers here and all the servants of god who are here and all those listening in maybe where they will listen to this around the world help them help every preacher visit those pulpits that the devil is wanting to take over why should the bethels of god be changed into chapels of men who have become kings and bosses marauding around because of the blessings that you gave them god have mercy upon your souls have mercy upon your sheep have my purse upon those souls that are being abandoned and they don't know what to do sheep that we're told that the message is the truth and then only to be told by the same person that was a lie help them father just follow this message in our hearts and jesus quicken us into that which you want us to be oh god bless the pastor here strengthen him encourage him lord you let me sometimes see a few things that go in his life and how he feels and how is his fault give him the grace encourage him and strengthen him and bless his wife and lord whatever they go through bless the congregation here the deacons the trustees and all the believers give them the grace to stand to stand and ashamed the devil and glorify you i thank you because lord you have done it so far and you can do it for them again i dedicate them unto you as your servant in the most holy and matched name of our lord jesus christ amen hallelujah [Music] sweet [Music] three spirits [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] sweet spirits [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] amen don't you love him love him because he's faithful amen love him because he's true love him because he never will fail amen i appreciate the word more than i ever have in my life it gets stronger as i get weaker the message gets stronger amen as i find myself more incapable of doing anything right i find how perfect the word is to do everything in my life that i can't do myself i found the message to be true amen i was thinking as brother abraham was preaching about isaac and rebecca how eleazar and brother ben was our eliezer went to fetch a bride for isaac and eliezer went with the message and rebecca believed it and laban and the other family members they were involved and and finally rebecca accepts the word and she travels all the way back to meet isaac and they meet they unite and he takes her into his mother's tent they become one i just imagine you know can you imagine if laban comes for a visit some years later it says oh rebecca rebecca i found out we're wrong eliezer wasn't a true servant he was an imposter and and those gifts that he brought he he got him from another source and eliezer wasn't true and can you imagine rebecca's saying it's too late amen i've been in the tenth i'm impregnated by isaac we've become one amen now it's not about whether eliezer was true or not true amen i've already been united with isaac the promised son listen the arguments don't matter anymore the criticism doesn't matter anymore if you've united with christ and become pregnant with the word of god it doesn't matter anymore it's too late to decide if it's right or wrong you're impregnated by the word it doesn't change anything amen somebody can say you know brother brenham was a liar and you say praise god and they say why you say praise god because god can use a liar to unite me with christ that's the power of god amen so it doesn't matter anymore it's too late amen let it be too late for you i mean let the reality of what we received make all the accusations it doesn't matter it's too late it can't change anything i've already been united with christ and what's growing in me will not stop growing because it's the reality it's the life it was the purpose it was the point of the message you cannot stop the message by stopping the messenger it's too late because the messenger brought the message and the message is alive and a bride you would have to stop every elect member of christ's bride to stop the message and you cannot stop this message too late so you can fight the prophet all you want but you're fighting a losing battle because the message is alive and a bride she's received her christ her isaac and she's now impregnated now the word is in her and you can't stop that and for that i say thank you god now god let me act like it let me live like it let me believe like it let me turn a deaf ear to everything else and give my whole life to this reality that i've received and quit listening to accusations and quit worrying about all these things let me put all my focus to this thing right now to this life because this is what you've called me today how many want to dedicate yourselves to what you are how many want to dedicate yourselves to the reality that you receive and quit listening to anything else and just focus on this that's what i want to do as i go home today what i want to do is be more dedicated to this reality than anything else i want to be more focused on the reality that i receive than anything else in this world that's the greatest desire of my heart amen god is good friends god is real this message is a living reality it's not books and tapes it's a living bride manifesting christ praise be to god [Music] amen if you want to be that committed bribe and focus though you raise your hands let's just bow our heads today and commit our lives of fresh to him let's just pray everybody pray don't just
