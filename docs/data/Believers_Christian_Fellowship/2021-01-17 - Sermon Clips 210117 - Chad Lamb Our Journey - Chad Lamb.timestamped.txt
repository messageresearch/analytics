[0:00] when we listened to brother branham on
[0:01] tape say when you
[0:03] heard the eagle scream you recognized it
[0:04] was eagle food and left all the others
[0:06] you've been turned into the living image
[0:08] of the living god you heard from your
[0:09] theophany you can say
[0:10] amen amen
[0:14] when you're looking listen to brother
[0:15] branham look look at a group of living
[0:17] people
[0:18] and say i was over beyond the curtain of
[0:19] time and i seen them all over there
[0:21] and i seen you all over there you can
[0:23] say that's nothing but the truth
[0:25] why because i got something the pharisee
[0:27] doesn't have i got something the
[0:28] theologian doesn't have
[0:29] what i have is i have a connection with
[0:31] god amen i've got a link to god
[0:34] i've got some way to hear amen some
[0:37] connection to the heavenly to the
[0:39] eternal that says
[0:40] that's true when the prophet says
[0:43] something in your heart it says
[0:44] that's true and he says something else
[0:47] it doesn't matter what your head your
[0:48] head can be saying what where was that i
[0:50] didn't hear that scripture
[0:54] amen don't tell me mine's the only head
[0:56] that does that
[0:59] i'm going to have to go back and pray
[1:00] now
[1:02] your head your head can be saying your
[1:04] mind your intellect can be saying what
[1:06] scripture is that i don't think he
[1:07] quoted that scripture right i don't
[1:08] remember it that way
[1:10] but didn't he say over here this way
[1:14] your head can be doing that but
[1:15] something in your heart's saying amen
[1:17] amen amen that's the truth
[1:21] explain it to me i don't know but it's
[1:23] the truth
[1:26] hallelujah if we got that friends we
[1:29] should have confidence amen we should be
[1:31] happy people
[1:32] we should say praise be to god but i got
[1:34] this problem in my life
[1:35] and i and i don't seem to overcome amen
[1:37] just focus on the thing that you got
[1:39] amen and the thing that you got will
[1:41] change everything else
[1:43] we spend so much time trying to be a
[1:46] pharisee that we won't be a disciple
[1:52] look at peter trying to compare his life
[1:54] with the pharisee
[1:56] peter the ignorant unlearned fisherman
[1:58] who really couldn't keep his mouth shut
[2:00] and got himself in a lot of trouble even
[2:01] with the lord
[2:04] imagine him trying imagine him trying to
[2:05] compare himself with judas
[2:11] you see this is where we make our
[2:13] mistake we don't put our focus on the
[2:15] most important thing
[2:18] we get deceit by the devil to try to
[2:20] become a pharisee
[2:21] i don't want to be a pharisee i want to
[2:24] be
[2:24] a real raw rugged true believer
[2:29] and i want god to take that life that's
[2:31] inside of me and i want him to live his
[2:33] own life in me i don't want to decide
[2:35] what he wants i don't want to try to be
[2:37] something i'm not
[2:38] i want the reality living in me to push
[2:41] out
[2:41] and make everything the way god wants it
