went in this week with some heart problems and had a stint and got out the next day and he's at church what two or three days later praise god well it's good to see you brother god bless you i also wanted to say that brother rich and sister charity carbon are in the visit they're not here this morning they're down he's preaching for brother mike sievert today but he'll be ministering for us on wednesday so we look forward to having him do that for us and it's been a little while he's visited quite a bit and hasn't had opportunity because his schedule's always busy so we made plans three or four weeks ago so by the grace of god he'll be here on wednesday also want to ask you to pray for my family my grandmother passed away on thursday evening this past week and we'll be going down back down home on wednesday for the funeral and on thursday for the graveside service and burial so i just want to ask you to pray for us as we travel and it was the grace of god that she passed away you know this is my mom's mother and she had been praying that she would be able to pass away peacefully in her home and god granted her request and that's exactly what happened she was peaceful she was sleeping and then all of a sudden with no struggle she just stopped breathing and that was an answer to our prayer she was 89 years old she'd have been 90 if she would have lived to june 6. so she had a full life and we thank god for his mercy i also want to thank you personally the sisters here and the ones who would encourage mom along the way the last several months were really difficult taking care of grandma my aunt and my mother did that and several of you made a big difference and you know who you are and i want to say thank you and god bless you and just keep our family in prayer as we travel down there and while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to genesis chapter 1. genesis chapter 1 and verse 26. these verses are so familiar that we read over them again and again and again but they're also so rich that they keep giving us more and more meaning because the word of god is eternal genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth man let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we come to you god and ask that you would come and break the bread of life for us this morning lord we can through the gift of literacy be able to read this word but only you can give us the understanding mom lord i pray that you would come and that you would bring your word to past lord that you would minister through these lips your eternal words the lord may always say and all we do be pleasing to you father may you instruct us as your children in this hour that we're upon the earth in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated let's turn to genesis chapter 2 verse 18. genesis 2 18 says and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him and we we know this we're very very familiar with these things but when he said i will make him a help meet for him this word help me literally means a helper just literally a helper and that's the about the simplest of the translation you can get and so let's turn over to genesis chapter 5. this is chapter 5 verse 1 this is the book of the generations of adam and the day that god created man and the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created so we find that god god from the beginning has declared the end god has declared his very heart purpose from the very beginning in the book of genesis and when god was creating as we've so often said he wasn't just doing something for fun something trivial something just but he was actually declaring his whole plan from the very beginning what his whole desire was and his whole desire was to have his expression himself expressed as male and female united together upon the earth that was god's plan amen and he showed it he foreshadowed it in in his son adam and his son's wife amen and they come together and god had created him male and female so within adam was both the male and the female as one in adam but god looked down and he said it's not good that man should dwell along i will make a help meet or a helper for him amen so he took he took and he brought up all manner of uh of beast and all manner of these things out of the earth and none of them was found a suitable help me a helper for adam because the only one that would be suitable would be one that was like him so we know this story been through it uh dozens and dozens of times you probably know what i'm going to say for the next three or four minutes you could probably say it but it's a great foundation that we've always got to go back to amen because this is the foundation he laid in the bible so it's a foundational truth that's going to always be true and anything contrary to it will be false so this is why it's so important so the only suitable help would be would be one like him and that one that was like him was part of him was with him was in him so god would separate the masculine and feminist spirit pull the feminist spirit out take a rib and from the rib fashion a woman another vessel and in that other vessel that came from the original vessel he would put the spirit that came from the original spirit and he would call that expression woman and he would call the other one male or man man and woman male and female god's the one who gave these terms amen that's why when the when the world wants to wants to change the meaning of these terms amen and change the purpose of the terminology are not even used amen any gender terminology at all they're denying the very god who has created them because god's the one who made the designation it's god's work from the very beginning and so now god god is what's he doing he's expressing himself he's expressing his desire he's expressing his plan amen and he forms the woman and he brings them back together to be one amen and as in as as one now he calls their name adam signifying that they are the same they are adam but they are adam expressed in male and adam expressed in female so we clear on that the deathsmith makes up adam adam expressed in male and adam expressed in female and i'm going to preach by the grace of god tonight on the message the dominating female spirit and the reason that i i take that uh subject that title is good it doesn't sound like a very nice title for one you know instantly it's like oh boy this is going to be fun but the reason i take that is as not pat this past wednesday when we preached on tithe and offering but the first time we preached on honoring god i mean when i got done with that service we had preached that service that wednesday night and i think brother ben came up to sing and he started the first song and as he started the first song a thought entered my mind i took out my pen and i wrote down dominating female spirit and that's why we're preaching this today because there's something that there's something about the dominating female spirit that does not honor god amen it's contrary to god's way into god's makeup so that's why that's where this came from and that's why we're preaching on this now i want to read to you out of the thyatiran church age from the church age book it says it is most it is most worthy of note that the very name thyatira means dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that ruthlessly evades all conquers all and despotically controls now a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world now this is a huge statement to make a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world and this comes out of the church age book and so now you find out why you know for me i always when i see these statements these statements are are so emphatic they're so matter-of-fact and they're they're so powerful that i always ask myself why why why what is the greatest curse you know i believe it because the prophet of god said it but i always want to know the why behind the why behind the why because it always goes back to the very nature and essence of god in the very plan of god and i found for me the answers truly are in genesis god initiated i mean everything started in genesis all the seeds were planted in genesis they come to fruition in revelation it begins in genesis it winds up in revelation is that true and so we go back to genesis and find out this dominating female spirit and he says now the dominating female spirit is the greatest curse in the world and i would say one off the bat obviously is because it's contrary to what god did in the original and we'll get to that more in a moment then he goes and he says the wisest man the world ever saw was solomon and he said and he's going to begin to quote out of ecclesiastics 7 and verse 25 it says i applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madness and i find more bitter than death the woman now sisters were not talking about you brother brahm said that so i can say that but i want you to catch one and i died i didn't i i didn't title this because it didn't come to me the dominating female it came to me the dominating female spirit because the dominating female spirit can be on a man they understand so we're not just talking about women so you can relax women breathe easy we're talking about the dominating female spirit because that spirit can be on a man it can be on a woman it can be on an organization it can be on all kinds of things but it's a spirit and that spirit he said that now the dominating female is the greatest curse in the world and there's a spirit that brings a dominating female he said now this is solomon in ecclesiastics i find more bitter than death the woman whose hardest snares and nets and her hands as bands whose who who so pleases god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her behold this i have i have found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but i find not one man amongst a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found he's saying he's talking about uh and righteousness the right kind of woman the right kind of man he said i've counted one by one to get the account and one out of a thousand men i found but not one in a thousand women and like i said again relax it's okay because god is showing how rare the right kind of woman is extremely rare in this world the right kind of woman amen and those who will express the nature of the right kind of woman is extremely rare solomon counting one by one out of a thousand couldn't find one amen because it was the wrong expression whenever he came to that amen but when god originated his design he originated the correct expression and he wanted to stay that way but when the expression changed amen it brought chaos amen and then he quotes paul he says i suffer not a woman to teach or to serp authority and i'd like to go to that scripture if you will with me to first timothy if we can go to first timothy first timothy chapter 1 and verse 2. no i'm sorry first timothy chapter 2 and we'll begin at verse 11. paul is giving instruction for conduct in the church and he says let women learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve so he's starting now with the reason the reason behind the reason right now he's saying let the women learn in in in subjection learning signs with all subjection amen but i suffered not a woman to teach in order to serve authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve so first thing off the bat adam came first then the woman and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so now he's saying because now the woman can has to learn in science and all subjection and not to assert authority over a man because adam was first formed then even adam was not deceived in the transgression but the woman was deceived and so now because of that god has now placed the woman underneath the man in headship because of this fall in the garden of eden so i want to go back and and continue reading now that we laid that down he we're still in the third time church age from the church age book he said from the garden of eden onward one woman has constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man so he's saying from the garden of eden and onward the woman this spirit has constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man and right today it's a woman world with the goddess of america being a naked female as the female idol falling out of the skies remember her arms were iron bars characterized the first or ephesian age so her power has grown until she has gained absolute authority such authority beings usurped by her iron disposition now he's beginning to talk about the church and now he's going to go right into the catholic church because this is dominating female spirit is the spirit of the catholic church and the false churches and that's why this is a big deal but you always want to look at the why behind the why amen so i'm going to keep reading here now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her a woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition now that's why brother ben said it's a woman's world but i would say if you fast forward to the day we're in it's a woman's world on steroids amen because he was seeing women take domination he was seeing woman moving to realms that they traditionally did not hold in positions and places that would traditionally be said that wasn't for them it wasn't their place and he was seeing that and saying this is a woman's world america is a worship of women amen but but now we've got to the place where everything is being run by women they're they're advancing in political realms they're advancing in civil realms and workplaces to become bosses and ceos and all of these things and and take these positions that god never intended for the female spirit to take now that doesn't mean they're not qualified it doesn't mean they're not good at it doesn't mean they're not smart enough brother bannon was talking about women preachers one time and he says they can really preach do a better job than me but it's not the place god wants the woman amen that's not where he placed her that's not where he wants her and so being contrary to the very design and will and purpose of god amen makes it antichrist and you say it in modern culture and people look at you funny but but it's not it's not because amen that it's not because somebody doesn't want a woman to rise amen and have accomplishment and become a boss or a leader or any it's not because somebody wants to hold back the woman or somebody wants a woman woman than fear to man and brother bam said in many ways especially spiritually amen they're they're superior to men is what he says something along those lines they can catch things more quickly i think is what he said so it's it's not that it's because this is the way god designed it and this is the way god wants it and when we go contrary to what god wants and what god designed then it brings death not life so now we see powerful women ruling our nation it's just a sign of what's going on in the churches we have a woman vice president and the speaker of the house is a woman and all of these women rising in power all over the place it's not a good thing amen it's bringing death and destruction and chaos and it's not because they're not intelligent it's not because they're not they're not good enough it's not because they don't do a good job it's because that's not what god intended the female to be for that's the problem so i'm going to read this this last sentence that i this last two sentences i read now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition well that rule out rules out all the women politicians she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who truly who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real man makes a wife a doormat and i'll tell you why because you can't find one in a thousand that's why and brother benham said if you find that one you can't find one in a thousand if you find one she's a real jewel a real queen to you because she's rare and we've got a lot of rare jewels sitting in this church tonight amen and the men and the the children that are around them can say amen that's nothing but the truth and solomon had it right you can't hardly find one but i found a collection of them that jesus christ himself has collected out of the world so this is not anything against the woman the woman in her right place is one of the most glorious things that can display the very heart of god amen so i'm going to keep reading not a doormat no real man makes a wife a doormat but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted so praise be to god it goes both ways but he said if she's of the right nature of the right spirit she'll want to be under headship and if she breaks that image gone made of her she's perverted well who is it that perverts the image of god who is it that perverts the will and plan of god amen satan is the perverter of the word amen that's why brother ben said satan is her designer he's fashioned her to be perverted and a man that will let the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertain it to a man or cut her hair now when you want to get to the why behind the why behind the why this is the reason why god designated that woman to be under the headship of the male and that is why she cannot wear clothes that pertain to a male or cut her hair we can make it all kinds of other things and argue and fuss about the way it looks and more feminine and and ladylike and all of that but the real reason is because god wanted her under headship and she's not allowed to cut her hair she must have a sign that she's under authority and then she cannot dress like the one she's under god wanted a designation and a distinction between the two he wanted a male expression and he wanted a female expression and that's what he wanted it's not you know the the the you know so many times if your children go to college you know they're going to get bombarded by social norms created by men who were the ruling authority blah blah blah blah blah no it was a carry over some men who really had fundamental faith in what the bible said and we're trying to keep it going in society but it's been perverted now to what was good is now called evil and what is evil is now called good she's not to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself and when a woman evades the pulpit which is it is commanded she must not do she shows what spirit she is of being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently praise god that's nothing but the truth so i'm going to repeat it again so we don't lose it being a dominating female is antichrist so just let's just nail that down and call it for what it is being a dominating female is antichrist because it's anti-word because it's not in the word so it's antichrist because it's anti-word so being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently you see a dominating female you say the seeds of the catholic church are in you and say i'm not catholic i'm protestant no you're the same spirit the dominating female spirit that has moved the catholic church to it is is now working in you but when it comes to the word let god be true in every man's word a lie amen let us go back to the beginning in the original physical creation as we know it today god made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens rooster and hen there were two cattle the cow and the bull amen that is so simple i don't know why that has become so complicated but it is so simple that in the original creation god made a rooster and a hen a cow and a bowl a male and a female because that's what god wants amen and to change any of that structure is to change amen what god wanted is to become antichrist and anti-god praise god keep reading there were two cattle the cow on the bull and right down the line but when it come to man there was only one they were not a pair adam had been made in the image of god he was a son of god and as a son of god he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible so god took a byproduct of man to cause the fall woman never stepped fresh from the hand of god as a true product of god she was a she was produced from man and when god caused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from the other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female in creation can be immoral but the human female be may be touched in almost any time and that weakness in her allowed satan to seduce her by the way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god and his word now i want you to catch this and listen i i'm i'm talking about spirits amen those spirits are reflected in male and female that's right brothers and sisters but they're reflected in other things as well brother memory told us they reflected in the catholic church and the protestant churches but let's read this she's in a very peculiar position before god in his word she is the type of all things vulgar fowl and lotham on the one hand and on the other hand she's the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the receptacle of the spirit and blessings of god on the one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other she is called the bride of christ amen talk about two drastically different uses for the same vessel it depends on whether we stay with god's word or we leave god's word which one will reflect so she's in a peculiar position on one hand she is called mystery babylon the abomination before god on the other hand she is called new jerusalem our mother on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she is summarily cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen praise be to god which side do you want to be on and in this thyatiran church age she is a dominating female she is a mystery babylon she is the great she is jezebel the false prophetess why because the true female submissive to god christ is her head she has no word but his no thought but his no leadership but his but what about this church she has cast out the word destroyed the bibles and worthy essays of the godly she has slain those who would preach the truth she has taken over kings princes nations countries armies and insist that she is the true body of christ and that her popes are the vicars of christ she is entirely seduced by the devil until she in turn has become the seducer of others she doesn't know she's the great she is the bride of satan and has produced his bastard child religions boy there's some strong language there and i'm glad i can just read the prophet because he says it very straight he's describing the catholic church but but the church is reflected in the women amen the the condition of the nations reflected in the women of the nation condition of a church is reflected in the women of the church amen that's just the way it goes the condition of a family is reflected in the women in the family that's the way it works so god is showing the condition of the catholic church so i want to go to revelation 18 and look at revelation 18 for a minute revelation 17 begins to show this image of this riding upon the beast and then it begins to claim her destruction in verse 18 or chapter 18. but i want to pick up 18 verse 4. now remember brother branham told us she is entirely seduced by the devil until she in turn has become the seducer of others eve when eve left the word brother bam said when she left the word she left her mate and when she left the word amen she left the word because she was seduced she didn't leave the word because she wanted to leave the word she left the word because she was seduced she thought she was doing right this is what the prophet explains what she thought she was doing right that's why she took it to adam amen because she thought it was right and this great she thought she was right and thinks that she's right she is totally seduced by the devil and being so she becomes the seducer of others let's read this in verse 4. i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive none of her plagues for her sins have reached them to heaven and and god has remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double under her double according to her works in the cup which she had filled filled to her double how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow what she says in her heart is what she believes to be true and this this woman this false church amen she's she's described to be so wicked and so vile amen and that she's drunk of the wine of her fornication the kings have drunk of the wine of her fornication she is the great i mean she has harlot daughters she is so filthy and so vile in the description that god gives us in his bible but in her heart she says she has glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow she thinks she's the queen of heaven she thinks she's not a widow but she's married to christ and that she will see no sorrow because christ will take care of her how did she get to this place how did she get to this place where she can be so vile and so lose them with such horrible describing words descriptive words that would describe her condition but in her heart amen she believes that she is a queen and no widow and shall see no sorrow she was seduced she is seduced she's thoroughly desedused she thinks she's doing right she thought she was doing right with her decrees and her and her laws and her dogmas and her popes and her priests and and the and the killing everything that comes against it she thought she was doing the work of god all along but she was only glorifying herself she was seduced she was doing the work of the devil i want to turn to revelation chapter two brother branham is in the thyatira church age so i'm going to pick up the thyatira church age here in chapter 2. and he he begins to tell us that the thyatira he gives the definition of thyatira as dominating female and he says that's what she is in this age as the dominating female and we know thyatira expresses the dark ages when the catholic church came to its full power and began such a bitter persecution against the church and almost snuffed out the entire truth but god had preserved a remnant and so she's at the height of her power she's at the height of her authority in her glory in thyatira and he says she is jezebel and so i want to pick this up in revelation chapter 2 verse 18. and unto the angel the church and thyatirite these things saith the son of god who had his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass i know thy works and thy charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding i have a few things against me because thou has suffered that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication to eat things sacrifice into idols i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed in them that commit adultery with her unto great tribulation except they repent of their deeds so brother branham in reading the thythine church age shows that it's a dominating female and right here in the description of thyatira in the church ages in revelation chapter 2 he begins to describe a jezebel spirit that had come into the church and he had somewhat against them because they allowed that jezebel and so i want to go back and look at jezebel so turn with me to first kings and i just want to take a couple places real quickly and look at jezebel because i want to look at this spirit that's upon jezebel first kings 19. [Music] first kings 19 i'm going to read verse 1. and ahab told jezebel all elijah had done and says after the mount carmel showdown and he had taken in slain 400 of the priest of baal and ab told jezebel all that elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword and then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time see i want to look at the jezebel spirit and i don't even care about the person jezebel i want to look at the jezebel spirit that had invaded the church and then began to take control of the church and in this jezebel spirit she had her own religion she had brought in the worship of baal mingled it with with the worship of jehovah they were they were they were now worshiping both and elijah comes down and brother branham said elijah was her pastor said she didn't accept it but elijah was her pastor nonetheless so her pastor comes down amen and corrects that thing and what does jezebel want to do she wants to kill the pastor or the prophet brother branham or whoever says it amen what is that that's a rebellious jezebel spirit amen because the spirit of the woman is submissive submissive to the word she's not submissive she wasn't submissive to the word of god she wasn't even submissive to ahab and ahab he was perverted too because he just let her spat off the mouth and never corrected her for that i mean he had just seen the supernatural he knew that what happened had taken place he saw fire come down and lick up all the water and the stones and the sacrifice and all and he would still let her say something like that he was just as perverted as she was now let's go over uh chapter 21 first kings 21. this is when uh ahab wants to nabos ben vineyard and nabath will not give up the lord's inheritance he will not give up his portion of the inheritance of the lord for ahab so ahab is really upset he comes in pouting and whining in in chapter 21 verse 5 we pick up here the reading but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eat is no bread and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard and jezebel's wife said unto him thust thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth to jezreelite this is a spirit you know you don't even have to be a churchgoer to know that jezebel's bad right the name jezebel has become such a connotation of a wicked and a lewd and an evil woman amen it's so permeated even our culture that if you call somebody at jezebel you know that's not a compliment and so jezebel here is now taking a position that's not hers she's taking authority now she's going to take the leadership over the man she's going to take the leadership over the king because he's too weak to do it so she's going to step up to the plate and so many times you we find out that that that is so many times what has caused women to move beyond where they're supposed to go is because there was a perverted man who wouldn't take his position amen and a woman felt the need to take to take just to get something done to do something about this but when she made that step even though the man was failing she began to fail it's better to let the whole thing fall apart than to leave your position stay where god put you amen it's better to let the thing go into ruin than to step out of bounds of your position so he was perverted she says do you not govern israel like don't you even know how to handle this let me show you i will give you the vineyard and naboth she's now usurping authority let me continue reading here verse 7 and jezebel's wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of nabath the jezreelite so she wrote letters in ahab's name and sealed them with his seal so she begins to use his name she begins to use his name she's usurping authority she has no right to that ahab's not doing it but she's beginning she's being dinning to take his place this isn't her place but she's taking her his place his name his authority his seal amen and she's going to go and do what he can't do this is dangerous see she i'm going to start back in verse 8 she wrote letters and naham's name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters into the elders into the nobles that were in his city dwelling with naboth and she wrote in the letter saying proclaim a fast and set nabath on high among the people and set two men sons of below before him to bear witness against him saying thou this blasphemed god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die and the men of this city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them she was the one who got it done because ahab couldn't get it done and the whole thing was wicked to begin with i just wanted to read those so you can see the very nature of jezebel and what it is that was so loathsome in the eyes of god he would even use that name over in thyatira to describe the condition of the thyatiran church and what was going on amen it was a it was a hated thing in the eyes of god and it was despised amongst the nation of israel and and brother bam says in questions and answers on genesis he said then god taken from his side a piece of him a rib going back to adam and the woman and made a woman now where did he get the spirit woman genesis 1 26 he said let us make man in our image after our own likeness created he them male male and female man male and female he made the burly spirit for the man he made the tender little delicate feminist spirit for the woman and when you see a woman acting like a man she's got out of her place you see in the beginning see all right she's supposed to i think it's a shame that women has lost their dainty feminist place it's a disgrace i tell you it is in the message you must be born again 1958 he said therefore when a man a woman tries to act like a man dressed like a man talk like a man she's out of her place a woman is finished feminist sweet loving not big and carrying on and acting like a man well she's not supposed to be and when she does that her life is perverted she's sweet loving kind where adam is more the burly type for he was the man the masculine type the woman was feminist but it's the same spirit for he took her from adam now now think about this god when he's going to make man he's going to make the male and female and within the man was male and female but he said it's not good i'm going to help make him a help me he's going to have a helper and that helper was going to come out of him so he's going to take a and he's going to take a portion of the spirit that's in adam and he's going to pull it out and he's going to make the woman and he's going to unite the two back together and say these two are one this is adam but when god was going to make a help for adam he did not make a clone of adam this is what we need to catch it was not a clone of adam god already had this expression within this pressure was male and female but what did he want he wanted another expression of adam the same atom the same spirit but this expression was not a clone expression this was a female expression so it was the same spirit the same thing the same atom in male and in female and this is what god wanted he did not he didn't not want a clone he did not want adam male and male 1 he did not to want the woman to act like the male or the male to act like the woman he made a difference and a distinction because in order to help the male he brought out the female spirit and the female spirit is to help the male and together they make up one unit this is god's plan anything contrary to this plan is perverted in the message oneness he said if you'll notice how that eve was united with adam she became part of him did you notice in genesis 1 27 he created man male and female created he them now both male and female when it come to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then god took from his side a rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished god took from the side of adam a rib made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of adam for he was both male and female spiritually speaking both masculine and feminist so it wasn't a different spirit it was the same spirit that's why she was is that right she was adam but she was not a clone of adam she was adam because she was the same spirit that was in adam now expressed in a female expression and that was the female expression of adam and there was also a male expression of adam and when these two came together it was adam so god in his plan the one that he wanted to help amen was not a clone not an identical twin it was a female because god wanted these two things to express his own nature in his own plan that's why for the woman to get out of place is perverted and for the man to get out of place is perverted because we never can have the true image of god unless we have it reflected in male and female so i want to look at lucifer for a minute if we go to isaiah 14 with me i want to read a couple passages of scripture and then some things that brother branham said isaiah 14. isaiah 14 and 12 how art thou fallen from heaven and lucifer's son of the morning howarth thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the height of the clouds i will be like the most high. now remember when we read in revelation 18 this church has exalted herself and she says in her heart i am a queen and no widow i will see no sorrow because she is the bride of the devil and the devil said i will i will and he exalted i will be exalted above the stars i will be like the most high i will be i will be i will be amen and what is lucifer doing he is getting out of position is that right let's go over to ezekiel 28. ezekiel 28. ezekiel 28 and verse 11. moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto them thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the son full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabernacle thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that that was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so so god had given him a position i would say that was a good position that was been upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created to iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast it to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquity by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more brother him says in the seal of antichrist from 55 he says the right-hand man of almighty god was lucifer the son of the morning the the first god granted him almost co-workers with him he was co-worker partly equal with him only satan could not create so now you know like we're always looking at the why behind the why behind the why but really what happened in eden was a reflection of what had happened in heaven because god he had created lucifer and lucifer was his right-hand man lucifer was to be his helper his his his co-worker brother banham said and he set him as a covering chair right next to him and that's a good position but lucifer wasn't satisfied with his position he wanted to take god's position he wanted to be like the most high god amen and so now he begins to move out of the god-given position that god gave him a man and he wants to be like god brother ben says in the in the message of marriage and divorce he said now it was then man was made to rule over the woman by god's word she was no more co-equal with him she was co-equal in nature you know but when she broke god's word god made made a man to be a ruler over her genesis 3 16 if you want to put it down she was no more equal with the man she was the breaker of god's word don't you see she the church down here the breaker of god's word that throwed her completely out of continuity and that's what the church has done and throwed spiritual death upon the whole thing now you'll understand why i hammer at these things like i do it's truth this is the bible facts notice why did she do such a thing as this how could that lovely beautiful perfect woman notice why did she do such a thing being in that high order she was right with man co-equal with him but we all know now that she lost her co-equalness with man when she sinned and god said man will be your ruler from here out now that's the scripture if you want to we could read it i'm giving you the scripture so save time for this big hookup across the country that you might read it yourself notice the reason she did that how did satan ever get to her now listen the way he says did you know satan was co-equal with god one day he's talking about what was happening in the garden and she was co-equal with the man only she was the female he was the male amen and and she she broke that continuity by leaving the word and now she was put subject underneath the man but he says now notice the reason she did that how did satan ever get to her did you know satan was co-equal with god one day sure was all but a creator he was everything stood at the right hand of god in the heavens the great leading cherubim what happened he was a helper to god he was a co-worker with god is that what the brother brahm says but he left his position he left the word and he wanted the he wanted to be be like god amen he wanted to take god's position and it brought an absolute chaos in ruin in heaven and then it come down to earth and the war that started in heaven amen come down to the garden of eden and spilled out in man amen she was made amen she was made the helper the help meet of adam the man she was part of him the same spirit of him in the expression of female they were together co-equal partners in dominion over the earth amen but but she was reaching for something more than what was given to her amen and brought ruin to the whole thing who did it the helper who did it in heaven the helper who did it on earth the helper that's why when i talk about a dominating female spirit i'm not just talking about men and women i'm talking about a spirit that is not satisfied being the helper being the reflection being the feminine amen but wants to be like the one she was taken out of wants to be like the one who created her wants to be more than her position and that's what happens in men in the world when the woman is not satisfying her position or a man's not satisfied in their position it brings chaos in families it brings chaos and culture it brings chaos in our nation because people are not happy amen that's why they want to self-identify their own gender they're not they don't want what god wanted they want what they want i can't think of anything uh i can think of many things i guess but one of the most uh shameful things is to deny the very god who created you and gives you life and treat yourself like your god i can determine my gender since when i can determine my sexual preference since when it's not right it's a rebuke in the face of god he goes on to say in the god of this evil age notice what he will do his thoughts he thought god dwelt in worldly beauty he did that in heaven sin never began in the garden of eden it began in heaven when lucifer the son of the morning exalted himself in beauty and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than that of michael and he thought that god dwelt in beauty see lucifer was deceived himself the woman was deceived and the catholic church is deceived and the protestant church is sade deceived they're deceived but they're reaching beyond the bounds god gave them and trying to take something a position that god didn't put them in and they were deceived thinking it was good thinking he was right and god dwelt in beauty 1959 questions and answers now let's turn to the new testament to luke 10 18 just a minute and see that jesus said in the book of luke you that have your bibles now that's trying to get on those questions luke 10 18. and he said unto them jesus speaking i beheld satan as lightning falling from heaven see satan was the original archangel of god he once dwelt in the heaven he once was the great person in the heavens outside of god he was god's right hand man to fellowship and he got puffed up in his heart 1959 questions and answers says now as i just got to basing up to this that lucifer in heaven tried to exalt himself even be just a little higher than his boss you know i said there's a dominating female spirit that spirit can show up all over the place but you find sometimes even in the workplace that shows up and unions are guilty of this unions become the dominating female spirit because they want to dictate to the boss what you can and can't do and what we will and won't do remember the bible calls the one paying the money the master and the one doing the work the servant that's the bible the one paying the money for work is the master and the one receiving money for work is the servant in the scriptures but see that spirit invades everything and it comes into politics it comes into schools now teachers have no more authority the kids have more rights in school than a teacher does and the principle amen and the school board and the parents all take up for the kids not the poor teachers because it's the spirit that's evaded our culture and permeated everything when they band together for a union and say we won't do this and we won't do that you know i i'm glad that i never was in management at a union shop because i wouldn't have lasted very long because i said where do you get that paycheck and where does that money come from see it's a rebellion against authority but that's the age that we live in so lucifer in heaven he was he was a co-worker with god he was a helper to god he was a covering cherub amen he was brother ben said he was the great one in heaven besides god amen but he wasn't satisfied with the position he wanted something more and when he wanted something more he brought he broke the continuity of god and he ruined what was going on in heaven and eve when she she was given a position amen but but when she was by seduction it wasn't by it wasn't by a desire to be wrong it was a desire to be right but she was seduced and then she was seduced when she began to act independently of the male the devil came along and and he began to talk to her and say you know uh uh uh uh is it did god say yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree and she says yay he said we shall uh uh not eat of the eat of all the trees but of this tree we shall not even touch it and and he begins to seduce her he begins to speak to her amen and then without the male just the female expression of adam amen independent from the male see god wanted them together to be one but now she's here working independent of the male and when she's independent of the male she begins to listen to the serpent and he begins to say you know god does know that when you eat this you'll be like god's knowing good and evil now she had a position and she had a place but when he began to entice her with something more she was seduced and enticed by wanting to reach for something more than what she had and she was not with the male she was separate from the male and she begins to have this conversation and she begins to reason without the influence of the male how do you think the catholic church got off in the beginning amen she was seduced with something and began to reason without the influence of the male independent from the mail the devil comes along this is what he always does i mean even the devil in heaven he begins to deceive angels i don't know what story he told them or what he was talking to them but if those angels would have went back and asked god amen they might have got a different story so now she she now in her own wisdom in her own brightness you see it's a repeat of the same story that's in heaven in her own wisdom and her own reasoning she begins with her own eyes to look at the tree and begins to make judgments based off the tree all by herself she saw that it was good pleasant to the eyes a tree to be desired to make one wise and a tree that was good for food she is independent of the male by herself judging this tree and she is totally completely deceived and this is where she has something now she wants to give to adam now she's the one with something to give to adam instead of adam taking her through the garden and saying this is how this happened and this is what father god told me and this is what i named this and what i named that now she's got something she can give adam and it brought death it brought death she was supposed to be united they were supposed to be one and if they had faced that trial together it would have been a different story let's read out of the pergament church age from the church age book he says this is when he was told to pick up your pen and and pick up your pen and write so he's just picking up his pen and he's writing he said from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin so now we know that god has a manifestation he wants to manifest part of the word that part pertains to the virgin so this is a a woman expression a female expression the word of promise came to the virgin mary but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6. he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our body are subject to our heads now he's showing the relationship between christ the husband the bridegroom and the bride he's showing this relationship now she is a further expression of christ amen and she is uh the expression of the virgin and all that would be done in the virgin will be done in her they they the members of the virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father catch this harmony catch what he's telling us jesus never acted independent of the father john john 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride so the harmony between jesus and the father is the same harmony that exists between the groom and the bride amen jesus never did anything on his own he said i only do that which the father shows me jesus who was god was emmanuel was god made flesh he never worked independently of his father amen he worked in harmony with his father because if he worked independently he would have went off amen but he stayed true to god and he straight to his expression i want to get to that in a minute and this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise she will not be like eve she will not be like the catholic church she will not be like the churches because christ our headship is come amen and she will not do anything without the headship of christ which is the word and the word has been restored in this day through a prophet and she will not move outside of that headship amen to declare her own thing praise be to god he says now those in the bride do only as well no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word it has to be who doing what it has to be who doing what it has to be him amen they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time praise be to god he's showing the position of the bride in this day amen is the position of the virgin and the headship will come the word will come and it has to be him working through her amen it's not her works because mary could not produce anything mary was mary was the fulfillment of the word she was the manifestation of the written word because isaiah had prophesied a virgin shall conceive and here comes mary and mary is the fulfillment of that word but mary has no power to bring that word to pass amen she cannot make it happen although she's ordained amen she's the one god has chosen she's the ordained vessel that god is going to produce his word through she is the virgin she is the woman she is the expression amen to express that part of that word amen but she cannot do it independently of the male she cannot leave the mouth she cannot go off on her own amen she has to wait until the male comes to her and when he comes to her through an angel messenger he tells her the time and the word and she accepts it and when she accepts it he comes and performs his word in her see eve got ahead of god's program amen amen eve she she wanted to do right she wanted but she went independently of the male trying to do right amen she was supposed to be united with her adam amen and every church that has failed has venture off independently of a male and when she becomes independent she seduced not none none of these churches fell because they wanted to become bad churches amen the catholic church didn't fail because it wanted to become a bad church it was seduced but when it left the headship of the male amen now they begin to use their own reasoning now she's separated and independent from the male and now she's making her choices based off reasoning and eyesight and intellect and deception comes in and chaos comes in behind it that's why a dominating female is a curse the greatest curse in the world because she's supposed to be submissive because the church is supposed to be submissive to her headship which is christ which is the word so the expression that god wanted in mary the expression that he was looking for was not somebody who could go and do something that's not what he wanted in mary the expression that he wanted in the virgin is somebody that he could come to and work in and work through somebody who would accept his word believe it and say be it unto me according to thy word he was looking for submission he was looking for surrender he wasn't looking for mary's ability because mary had no ability and today he's not looking for his bride to do anything that he's promised to do he's looking for a bride that will say that's nothing but the truth and i surrender to it because they know it has to be him in them doing the works he didn't complete them in his earthly journey he left them now to do in and through the bride but it has to be him doing them not her doing them the only thing she can do is surrender to him and when she surrenders to him it'll be him doing it every church failed when they thought they had to do something every time i failed is when i thought i had to do something in the invisible union of the bride of christ said but you remember when it went down and the grain began to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly the same grain that went into the ground the same jesus in bride form this is what i want to emphasize on the same jesus in what kind of expression it's the same jesus in bride form same power same church same thing same word same word sucked up through these and came out here and came to the head here now remember we go all the way back to the garden of eden when god wanted to create a helper for adam and we wanted to further his program and further reveal himself amen he would bring out of adam the female the feminist spirit amen and he would bring them back together and unite them as one and this was god's program but remember i said he didn't make a clone she was adam she was the same thing adam was she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone but she looked different anatomically she looked different because god wanted her to portray another revelation another manifestation of what adam is does that make sense adam and him was male and female amen and he he looked the part of male but he was male and female as one but god when he brought out the female did not create a clone did not create a picture match amen he gave the expression he wanted to this portion of the spirit that he pulled out and that expression was female amen in the day we live in it's jesus christ amen it's christ christ is here but what form is he in he's here in the form of his bride the feminine expression of christ and what is the characteristics of the feminine expression dainty sweet kind loving submissive honoring amen yielding reverent submissive to her husband 1965 i've heard but now i see now everybody knows that we have a promise of the church condition in the last day the church in its present condition can never fulfill the commandment of god the great commission can never call the bride out which one would do it the pentecostals i should say not none of the rest of them that's that's the shock that's on the wheat that come out look just exactly like the wheat but there was no wheat to it it opens up but the grain comes out of that they organize they kill themselves that's where they die their stalks but the wheat has come up through there and now it's begin to form in the bride form so it's the same life that was in jesus christ only it was in the bridegroom form now that same life has come up as an expression in the bride form the corner wheat that fell on the ground through the dark ages it had to die he says in things that are to be in 1965 now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride in what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creator or a name denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god and the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living what is what what is the manifestation i'll go backwards what is the manifestation of this hour the word bride the word bride what is she she what is the word bride amen the manifestation of this hour the bride not creed not the nomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world amen god wants to display this to the world this is an expression god wants to express to the world he wants to display to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living oh i think that's so important i think it's so important because because if we're not careful amen we try to go back and replicate another expression but that's not the expression for this hour the expression for this hour is christ in bride form amen there was a male and female expressed in adam but there come an hour there come a time then he wanted adam expressed in female form in bride form so he pulled he laid adam down pulled a rib out took part of his spirit amen he created the woman because he wanted that expression in that hour amen and then the crowning act of creation is when he brought those two together to be unified as one but when they come together to be one amen that didn't mean that the woman amen would ever change to the male or the male would ever change to the woman but you had an expression of male and an expression of female and those two together make the image and god has done the same thing down through time amen he has brought up his first son failed his first created son upon the earth failed adam failed amen adam failed to keep the word that what brother bim said and he was only expressing christ to go out with his wife amen to save his wife but he failed so god started rebuilding the image amen because what he had built the first time was his masterpiece was his great work was the great thing that was holding in his mind and that masterpiece was ruined amen because the woman acted independently of the man and was seduced but god goes to bring it back amen and where the male had felt fallen god was going to bring back a male that wouldn't fall is that true where the male had fallen now he goes to work through the apostles to the patriarchs the apostles and the prophets and he begins to build back what's he doing he's bringing back a son of god on the earth that won't fall and he come to jesus christ the perfect expression of that son amen and when he come as an expression of that son he was the expression of the son that's why when he was here the bible tells us he was immanuel god with us is that right he said my father and i are one amen he knew that it was god in him and brother man said all that god was he poured into christ what was it it was god in the form of a son is that right do we believe that it was god in the form of his son in the form of jesus christ it was god expressing through the sun but that sun would would express the sun he would not express the father he would pray to the father you understand that i hope you understand what i'm saying he he was he was here for a specific purpose and then that purpose was to express the sun the sun that would have dominion on the earth the sun that would not fall from the word amen the perfect son it was god in him amen but his expression his expression was not the expression of father the expression at that time was the expression of son that's why he said i only do that which the father shows me i'm in total submission to the father amen i don't do the works it's the father in me that do it amen what's he doing he he he is the father in flesh but he's expressing sun everything he says express sun the way he acts expressed sun everything about him is expressing sun and in that expression of sun he's got to be the good son because adam fell from that place so now he's got to restore back that sonship and in order to do it he's got to be the faithful son that always obeys the father amen that's why he would say i pray to the father that's why you'd be in the garden of gethsemane saying father let this cup pass from me but i thought he was god in flesh why didn't you speak and speak and speak he was expressing son and he was totally submissive to the will of the father he could not take the expression of father because it was time for the manifestation of son do we understand that i'm sure i'm doing a lousy job of expressing it but i pray the holy ghost quickens it to you and so now out of that expression of sun there's male and female in there but he wants the son to have a bride amen god wants an expression of female that's what he did in the beginning that's what fell that's what he's doing again he wants an expression of female so in order to have an expression of female he takes amen the spirit from the son amen and now he's bringing about the female which is the church and that church is to be the expression of female the virgin to the word all that was promised of the virgin shall be manifest in her amen supposed to be jesus christ in the formation of the bride the expression of bride the expression of wife he was faithful inspiration of son amen but now it's her time to be it's who is it it's jesus christ in the form of the bride is it god it's god it's the attributes of god every attribute of god is a part of god but god has attributes for expressions in certain times and certain seasons in certain ways amen and it's all god amen but the attributes god wants display today are the attributes of wife the attributes of bride the attributes of submission to headship meekness and quietness and gentleness praise be to god and when that expression begins to act independent of the headship of the word amen it's going to happen what's what's always happened will happen again amen god tried to have this bride all the way back when he brought israel out of egypt he was bringing them as a bride to him to mary on mount sinai but they fell by disbelieving the word by leaving the word amen and he could not marry that one she failed to be the right expression of bride and could not come into the union then he started over again in the first church of the church of pentecost and that church of pentecost amen they moved away from their headship and began independently in their form of bride begin to make their own decisions and take their own headship and when they did she was no longer suitable for the expression of bride amen and she was put away is that what brother brown tells us but he's prophesied and promised that in the end time there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle there will be a union there will be a bride who will not take her own headship will not get out of her role will not reach for another position but she will be submissive and meek and mild and totally surrendered to the headship of christ and that was the one he's been looking for all the way back as he's restoring amen the masterpiece amen there was never a church that could come to that place they would always amen under seduction they would begin to move independently of headship and look at things and make decisions on who can be a priest and who can't be a priest and who can what what do we decide on this doctrine what do we decide on that doctrine because that's not the expression he's looking for he's not looking for an independent woman brother bam said the bride is an independent independent from all others and not independent from him she's independent from every other system she's independent from every other man she's independent from every other idea but she is completely totally dependent and surrendered to her husband that's the expression he's looking for in this hour lucifer failed eve failed israel failed the church of pentecost failed but this bride won't fall she won't fail she's predestinated not to but what's it going to take it's going to take a complete surrender a meek mild submissive nature let's go to john chapter 15. in verse 4. john chapter 15 verse 4 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me that's just saying the same thing i'm the vine i'm the male you're the female i'm the vine you're the branches three verse four again abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of its uh itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing how will you ever bring forth life without the mail and you're not the expression of the male you're the expression of the female so you're totally dependent on the male to bring forth life because the hebrew globe and the life the blood is with the male that's why we're dependent on the word that's why the word came in the days as our headship that's why we're totally submissive and dependent to that word because life is coming to that word because jesus says without me you can do nothing what do you mean i can do nothing i'm an attribute of god you understand what i'm saying i'm an attribute of god i'm part of god amen a part of elohim that's true so was jesus christ jesus christ was part of elohim he's part of god he was god made flesh he was immanuel god with us and in that expression he would do nothing outside of what the father told him because his expression was son he stayed in what god put him and expressed what god told him to express is that right let's keep reading oh let's keep reading here i want to read verse 5 again i am the vine you are the branches he that abide in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you separate from the vine you bring no life if the female separates from the male she brings no life amen if you these churches who separated from the vine from the mail they brought no life they were cut off and cast into the fire but this bride won't be that way let's go to john chapter 5. john chapter 5 verse 30. this is jesus christ now before i read this don't look down look up look up look up you're going to ruin my surprise jesus was emmanuel we know that the scripture tells us he was he was the fullness of the godhead in flesh he was all that god was reporting to christ we know all of these things but he was given a certain expression for a certain hour and he was going to stay true although it was the fullness of god in him he was only going to express that portion that god gave to him he was only going to do what the father shows him and now he comes down to verse 30 he said i can of mine own self do nothing listen friends what an example for us amen yes we are the bride yes it is jesus christ yes you are the word but you cannot act independently of the male amen you cannot go off on your own you cannot make up your own way you can't go by your own feelings you can't you have to stay tied to the male because your expression is not male your expression is female this is the hour for total surrender total submission and then total patience and waiting on god because without him we can do nothing he's the vine we're the branches amen the vine the the vine has come back amen the word has come back the male has come back to produce life but i cannot act independent of that god has taken the two and put them back together to reproduce the son of man again but i can't do it without him i in myself though in me down in my soul is a portion of god himself i cannot do it independently of the rest of the portion of god god has set it up to where these expressions must now come together to bring forth life the female expression independent of the male will bring death amen like it did in the garden amen and the male must have the female expression to bring forth life because that's the way god set it up amen god amen wanted a male expression and a female expression and here in the end time because there was a prophet here to unite the two the two have come together to produce life amen to be fruit on the vine again to be the very life of jesus christ on display in the formation of the bride but we have to stay true to our position just like just as much as jesus stayed true to his position let's keep read this again verse 30. i can't of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not my own will but the will of the father which has sent me jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily and he would do not do anything without the instruction of the father that's why he was the perfect expression of the son because he was the faithful son who would not leave the instructions of the father all the other ones failed he was typed in moses moses failed he was typed in david david failed is that what brother graham tells us he was typed out in moses and moses was the meekest man on earth and god had called him and but all of a sudden moses got frustrated and moses brother the scripture says he exalted himself and he said shall i fetch water shall i he was putting himself in the place of god he was speaking as god amen and god spoke through him and when he spoke the words of god it was the same as god speaking but he was in total submission to god when he spoke fleas and lies and frogs and all of that but now he comes to where he supposed amen he's supposed to speak to the rock amen and he smites it he takes his own action and when he takes his own action now he's punished and he's not permitted to go into why because he got out of the bounds of his expression when when god told him to speak he spoke it was the same as god speaking the creative power came out of the lips of a human being because god told him to do it but when he took it upon himself in anger and said shall i fetch water for you and your rebellions and stiffneck people and he struck the rock amen because he was a gift and because he was a prophet guess what came flowing out of that rock water but he himself was wrong because he left his position god didn't tell him to do that he took it upon himself to do that david was an expression of christ but he didn't stay true to the perfect son because he despised god and his sin with bathsheba all of these expressions of the sun the adam's expression amen abraham was expression no as an expression but he he was drunk and uncovered in his tent all these expressions failed why they failed by leaving the the realm god called them in and taking their own action for their own desire but jesus christ comes and he's the perfect son and he's god expressing himself his son and in that expression of son he'll never take his own will he'll never take his own desire he'll never move away from the instructions from the father showing what a perfect son is even till he come to the garden of gethsemane and he begins to cry and then he begins to agonize and he begins to sweat as it were great drops of blood this is jesus christ in his humanity brother branham said he was 100 god and 100 man and i do not know how to figure that out all i can say is amen and hearing as humanity as a son he's crying out to a father listen he is still emanuel it's still god in him he is still the word made flesh he is still the fullness of the godhead and he's crying out and he's saying father please let this cup pass from me he's not taking his own he's not saying well i'm the son of god the fact that he was the son of god put him in submission to the father and he's not making demands or commands he's asking the father can this cup pass from me he asks the second time can this cup pass from me and he asked the third time can this cup pass from me and he says nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he fulfilled the perfect expression of son the relationship between the son and the father was expressed and now in this hour the relationship between the bride and the bridegroom is to be expressed she's not to take her own way or to take her own mind or come up with her own ideas but the headship has already come and she is submitted to that headship you know let's turn to acts chapter 3. peter and all of those on the day of pentecost they received the baptism of the holy ghost the seed within them was quick in the life they had the very life of jesus christ on the inside is that true they all that god had promised all they got to prophesy was now in them they were the expression of jesus christ it was jesus christ moving and working through them amen they were the the attributes of god on display in that day and they come in chapter 3 verse 11 says and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomon's greatly wondering and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel you at this or why look you so earnestly on us as though by our power our holiness we have made this man walk paul [Music] paul and are not paul peter and john i didn't think it felt right we're walking along the saw lay men there was something in them there was a power in them amen to heal this man amen and they were quickened to life they were living attributes of god amen part of the family sons of god quickened the life and now they they they under inspiration or however it came to them they speak to this man he gets up and he starts walking and they begin to marvel and i want to i want to read it here in verse 9 again and all the people saw him walking and praising god and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which he had happened unto him and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the people ran together into them in the porch that is called solomon's greatly wondering and when peter saw it he answered unto them say unto the people ye men of israel why marvel you at this or why look you so earnestly on us as though we made this man to walk the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus which he delivered up and then up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted to you and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see in and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all peter and john had a perfect opportunity to receive glory and honor and praise they were there as living oracles of god they were there amen with the very life of jesus christ quickened on the inside of them they were there with a power that was supernatural and in that supernatural power amen they they spoke to a man he believed he raised up and they began to wander and say well i wonder as if we did this ourselves we didn't do this it was jesus christ the bride what was the bride doing the bride was bringing glory to her headship the one who was really doing the work they know that it has to be in them him in them doing the works we know is not going to say well i'm the bride i can't i'm the bride i can yeah i'm the bride because he made me bride not because i want to be bride i'm not bribed by merit i'm not bribed by conduct i'm not bride amen by works because mary was not the virgin by any power she had to do anything she was virgin by predestination she was the chosen woman by god's choice and all she could do was surrender and god did everything else and so mary doesn't get the credit for the birth of jesus christ god does amen these two men did not get the credit amen though they were bribed though they were they were united with christ though christ was living in they didn't get credit christ did because they knew it wasn't them amen just a few days before amen peter was dying and running away he knew it wasn't him he knew it was god in him and he was willing to give credit and not take any credit to himself was god in him john chapter 7 look back at jesus again john 7 and 16. jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me jesus didn't even teach he didn't even take credit for what he taught he gave credit to the father why because he was the expression of the son and he couldn't teach anything that the father didn't tell him to teach you see he was under his headship under his father and the bride in this day is going to be under her headship under the word jesus christ see jesus had no problem surrendering to the father and he had no problem declaring that he was surrendering to the father was he god yes he was god then why is he surrendering to the father because this is his attribute this is his expression this is his time of expression this is what the god called for in an expression so in that expression he stayed true to that expression well now god has called for expression of bride and that bride is is not going to go back and try to take credit for herself or replicate and say i've done and i she knows she's done nothing it has to be him i have no life i have no fruit i have nothing amen i'm the branch he's the vine amen he's the one he's the one who called me he's the one who placed me he's the one who's positioned me now it's him it's not me and i want to stay subject to him i don't ever ever want to work independent of the vine because that's what caused failure every time brother branham said in the message influence you know the reason i'm saying this is because when you hear you're the bride you're the bride you're the bride you're the bride so much you can begin to make it can become carnal and it can come to a place where now all of a sudden we feel like i can i can i can i can and the real reality comes back to the fact is without him i can't without him i can't without him i can without him i can but he can he can he can he can is the bride the chosen vessel yes amen is she the tabernacle of deity for this day yes is she the one who has the word of life in this hour absolutely is she the tabernacle or jesus christ it's tabernacle yes is it the fullness of christ born in her absolutely but it's not her it's him in her you know in israel it got to the place where it was god in the temple amen and they so reverenced and respected the temple because of god in the temple but it shifted somewhere along in their minds where they begin to honor and respect the temple not the life that was in the temple and the evidence becomes so true when jesus christ is standing here because now the shekinah glory that was in that temple was now in another temple and they so loved the temple not the life that when the life came in another temple they hated the temple and hated the life so deity is tabernacled in flesh on earth today absolutely it's jesus christ in bright form amen but that bright form is just a tabernacle that he's dwelling in and he's expressing bride through that vessel through that tabernacle and we don't want to exalt the vessel until the vessel starts to act like moses and say shall i fetch but she's supposed to be submissive and timid and meek and say lord what should we do lord what would you have me do lord what does your word say show me in your word what to do because you're my headship brother branham says in the message influence now notice secondly with two wings they covered their feet what did that mean humility before god in his presence he's talking about the the seraphim amen that are around the throne of god he said holy never sinned but with two wings they're in action two wings they cover their face amen and two wings they cover their feet in humility he says like moses at the burning bush took off his shoes when he heard him say i am that i am. paul on his road to damascus he fell on his face john when he saw the spirit of god above jesus he said i have need to be baptized to thee and why cometh down unto me here is a good example always be conscious of your littleness not your bigness oh if you want to see an expression of bride in this day take that to heart amen don't get puffed up don't get elevated yes we preach about the bride because that is the word for this hour that is the manifestation of jesus christ in this hour but we as vessels amen that god has chosen to be the bride our expression is not sun not bride groom our expression is bride and we have to stay true to the bride so the sun can be expressed through the bride because it's him expressed in bright form and i want him to be expressed properly in this day he said always be conscious of your littleness not your bigness today we americans so much that we try to think we're big somebody we belong to something big some big organization some big great something oh great big big is is all we see but first john 4 4 says year of god little children have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world it's still him and me amen it's still him he's the object of our adoration he's the object of our love and he's the one that we're submissive to romans 16 20 said in the god of peace shall bruce satan under your feet shortly who will do what where will satan be bruised under the feet of the bride will the bride do it no will it be done through the bride yes will it look like the bride does it yes but it'll be him and her finishing the work that he left for this hour and she will be totally submissive to him with a meek gentle quiet spirit she'll never tell him what to do she'll be told what to do by him i want to read this quote out of anointed ones at the end time now i want you to know this is sure and and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing i say that's the right attitude are you the bride well because he chose me to be i didn't work my way up to it i didn't earn it it's by his grace and his grace alone and i'm so thankful he called me to be his bride i love him so much for his choice i love him so much for his plan it's not me i can't be arrogant about it i can't be extra bold i can't be harsh i just say thank you lord i can't go up to somebody say don't you know i'm the bride that's not feminine expression this feminine expression is he told me talk to him he's my husband i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declared to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect perfect they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it was it wasn't what i knew it wasn't i let me repeat that again because this is good i'm i'm only i'm only one that's near when he doesn't i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man it wasn't me it wasn't me who believed the message it was him and me it wasn't me who even had the heart to surrender i had a rebellious nature before god got a hold of me but he quickened something to me it's him and me that surrenders back to him it was god and the son that was reflecting back to the father and playing the part of sign amen now it's christ in the bride that is playing the part of the bride the bride the wife the godly wife the faithful wife the one who will not go independent and go out on her own and fall like the previous ones did but she will stay united to her headship united to the male which is the word and then together amen they will be united and bring forth life because it's the vine and the branches connected again and if god does anything it wasn't because i took a self-proclaimed title as bride if god does anything through me it's because he determined for the foundation that's what he was going to do and the only part that i had in it was to just surrender and get out of his way and let him do it and for that i will worship him for eternity he will always be the object of my worship and my adoration and my affection but aren't i god too there's a part of god in me yes a portion but this portion worships the father this portion that's bride will worship the bridegroom because that's the way god wants it let's read revelations 4 the last scripture that we read revelations chapter 4 verse 8. and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him they were full of eyes within they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who lived forever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created brother ben said i don't want a crown and i don't want a robe i just want to look at him for thousands of years for eternity i want to look upon his face and love him amen there's no self-inflated ideas there's no independence from him there's no i'm this therefore i can do that but there's just god i need thee every hour i need thee you've got a mighty work that you want done in this hour there's something amazing that you want to portray there's something powerful you want to display and you want to display yourself in the form of the bride and i believe you've called me to be an expression of that bride but god without you i can do nothing i need you lord to come and do the works in and through me i'm a failure to begin with but all i can do is surrender to him in meekness and humility and say god if you're going to do a mighty work it's going to be you independent of me all i can do is say be it unto me according to your word we can't reverence him enough brother ben said you can't humble yourself enough you can't reverence enough reverence him enough it has to be him doing the work the prophet of god he would demonstrate manifestations like this world has not seen since the time of jesus christ but if you ever watch deep call it to the deep the man will be standing there now listen if i had all the manifestations and gifts and demonstrations of power that was in him i don't know what i would be like it would probably ruin me but god knew who he could trust and the prophet of god would stand there amen and he would stand there and and i believe it's the the deep caller to the deep video and he calls the prayer line there's thousands of people in this in this uh auditorium he has uh advertised healing campaigns and done all of those things and he's sitting here on the line amen promising healing talking about divine healing amen there's a testimony of the works that were done before and he's standing here calling a prayer line and he starts to hem haul around now you know and this and you know that and this is the patient let's get a line and and then all of a sudden he stops he said now you know i'm waiting on something no temptation to work it up to protect his ego to protect his image he would say before on tape now i have no guarantee that'll come what would he do manufacture something or walk off the stage others have manufactured to save their reputation to work up the crowd pump them up have a have a big mass prayer amen and move on but brother branham is standing there so meek knowing it's not him it's what god told him it's not him it's the word of the lord it's not him it's the word of god and then he just gave the word of god and he's been commissioned by an angel and he's standing here under his commission and he's saying now you know i'm waiting for something no i'm just waiting for the angel now many of you have seen him you've seen his picture taken and i'm not getting the words exactly right but you've watched it you know totally totally giving all credit to god he himself amen was a subject of god a subject of jesus christ a son that was in obedience was he a manifestation of god yes was it god working through that man yes was it a son of man revealing the son of man yes but he is an individual attribute of god is in submission to the father in total surrender to him acting the part of a son saying now if you don't come there's nothing i can do it wasn't his reputation he had so separated himself from the work of god that he knew it would have to be god and not him he if it didn't work for him he wasn't going to be a failure because he was already the failure all of a sudden he says he's here and everything changed the sermon was spotless it was powerful the healings were manifested right on the stage what was it that was a man who would not get out of his position that was a man who did what god told him to do the way god told him to do it and stayed humble and submissive and reverent to his father to his lord so i want to be the same thing take all desire for self-protection away lord take all desire to prove something or to manifest something i don't have to prove i'm bride it's not the the the the obligation to prove there's a bride on the earth is not my obligation it's his obligation because he sent a prophet to tell us to be a bride here in this hour and that bride would be the manifestation of jesus christ and bright form it's not my responsibility to prove anything i don't want to feel any any any responsibility for proving because i'll get pushed into air trying to make something happen when all he's asking me to do is be like the virgin so all that was promised to the virgin can happen through me and say lord i i can't do that i haven't even been with a man he said no it'll be the holy ghost okay be it unto me according to your word just do it lord i can't do it you can in this hour he's looking for the female to be expressed the last atom is expressed in male and in female that a female expression is jesus christ it's him it's him but you have to know what expression of him it's been god god and noah god god and moses god and david god but what expression for what hour what attribute on display what portion of the nature of god does he want displayed and what does he want displayed in this hour he wants to meek sweet gentle reverent submissive woman and i said god that's what i want to be make me that old god i'm raising my hand to say i can't do it myself lord but it's what i want it's the hour for it and i want to surrender myself and say lord come and do all that you've promised to do in this hour through this vessel because i can't do it myself you are the vine you've called me to be the branch let me stay connected to you because if i'm not there'll be no fruit and if there's no fruit i'll be cast away paul the apostle was the prophet of the age amen manifestations and demonstrations and revelations were coming off of him and mighty power is that true and he said i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest when i have preached to others i should be a cast away you would think he would be so secure and say well i'm the prophet of the age and i'm this and i'm that but look at the nature of brother branham amen there wasn't a man that i ever saw with my eyes i heard with my ears had more power working in their life than that man but he was so humble and submissive and reverent the apostle paul had revelations and manifestations and power demonstrated from him but he would still say even with all of that i still must bring myself and my body subject to him lest when i've preached to others i should be a cast away you would think he had nothing to worry about but he recognized his littleness and his need for god say god help me never to forget my littleness and my need for you it doesn't change the fact that i know i'm his bride i know it i know this is the hour for the manifestation of the bride but yet without him i can do nothing it's all him not me but it's him through me amen let's all stand we were thinking on wednesday we were preaching about tithes musicians of you come we were preaching on tithes and we we marveled i'd like to sing that song like you alone are worthy that we're preaching on tithe and we were learning how a hundred percent of it comes from god is that right it all comes from god i'm god asking you to return 10 not of yours but what are he giving you of his and if he if you give him back that 10 and and offerings that he will bless the rest of it supernaturally powerfully it was all his to begin with but if you just obey him he'll bless it then i was thinking of the the the uh judgment of rewards when you stand before the lord and you're judged for the deeds done in the body and he gives out rewards you think what did i do anyways i mean i give you back a tithe but you gave me 100 you gave me all the money all i did was give you back what you said was yours i didn't really do anything but in doing that you blessed me and now in the judgment of rewards what did we do anyways it was all him and us he was the vine we were the branches it was his life it was his doing amen if i had any gift it was a gift he gave to me by his own predestination it's not anything i had or came up with or had of myself i had nothing to give him i had nothing to do for him the only thing i was able to do was just surrender [Music] and for surrendering i still get a reward how good is god how wonderful is he and how much he wants us just to surrender to him amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we worship you lord because you're worthy of our praise god this hour you've called for an expression like no other the lord we can't do it independent of you and you've proved that you've come in this hour you've sent a prophet to display your presence lord you're here lord you're here as the headship the word that has been restored back and god you're asking us to stay connected to that headship and to not leave it the woman she went independent she failed lucifer went independent he failed israel church at pentecost they all went independent and they failed dear lord we don't want to go independent we don't want our own way we don't want our own mind we want to stay with that headship you've given us and stay a
