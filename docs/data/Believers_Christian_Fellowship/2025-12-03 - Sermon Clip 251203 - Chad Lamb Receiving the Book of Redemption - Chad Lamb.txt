========================================

But why did he come and restore the truth? Why do we need to know about serpent seed? Because if you don't know about serpent seed, the open book of redemption doesn't mean anything to you because YOU DON'T KNOW WHY you're hybrid. You don't know what you were supposed to be. You don't know THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO ALWAYS BE A MAN ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; You were not meant to be an angel. You were not meant TO BE A CHERUBAM. GOD NEVER INTENDED FOR YOU TO BE A HEAVENLY BEING. HE ALWAYS MEANT for you to be a man on THE EARTH, A GOD MAN, A GOD RACE living on the earth. And serpent SEED TELLS US WHAT WENT WRONG. IT'S NOT SO WE KNOW MORE THAN A BAPTIST OR NO MORE THAN THE CATHOLICS. IT'S SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT REDEMPTION IS ALL ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE DOCTRINE OF THE GODHEAD FOR? IT'S NOT SO WE CAN SAY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS WRONG. MY GOODNESS, most everybody knows the Catholic CHURCH IS WRONG. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND GODHEAD SO WE KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT FAMILY WE'RE PART OF, WHERE WE CAME FROM, AND WHAT GOD IS ACTUALLY WANTING TO DO WITH US. &gt;&gt; WHO WE REALLY ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; All of these truths that were restored, THEY WERE RESTORED FOR THE PURPOSE OF US UNDERSTANDING REDEMPTION, NOT SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A THEOLOGICAL DEGREE IN THE BIBLE. NOT SO THAT WE HAVE A PROPERLY SET UP CHURCH. NOT SO WE HAVE A HIGHER MORAL CODE. NOT SO THAT WE HAVE NICER LOOKING FAMILIES BY BY THE REVELATION OF THE WORD. WE'LL DO ALL OF THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE IS SO OUR EYES WILL COME OPEN SO WE WILL KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG, WHO WE ARE, WHERE WE COME FROM, AND WHAT GOD IS TRYING TO DO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BUILDS FAITH. AMEN. TELLING YOU, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOKED APART AND YOU GO TO THE RIGHT CHURCH AND YOU GOT THE RIGHT PASTOR AND ALL THE DOCTRINES LINED UP, YOU'LL BE ACCEPTED BY GOD AND YOU'LL BE RIGHT. LISTEN, THAT IS THAT IS FRUITLESS. THAT'LL BRING NOTHING BUT misery and heartache cuz we'll NEVER GET IT RIGHT. BUT YOU GET THE REVELATION OF REDEMPTION AND YOU FIND OUT YOUR NAME WAS ON THE BOOK AND YOU WERE ALWAYS PART OF GOD'S PLAN AND GOD ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO BE A MAN. HE ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO BE IN FLESH AND HE WANTED YOU TO BE HIS FAMILY REPRESENTING HIM ON THE EARTH. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU TALK ABOUT FAITH THAT GIVES YOU OVERCOMING FAITH. &gt;&gt; NOW WHY AM I STRUGGLING SO MUCH? OH BECAUSE OF THE FALL IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. I'M IN HYBRID FLESH. I'M STRUGGLING NOT BECAUSE I'M NOT A SON OF GOD. NOT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE WORD. I'M STRUGGLING BECAUSE ADAM fell &gt;&gt; and now I can be a son of God and in a HYBRID BODY AT THE SAME TIME. YOU TALK ABOUT BUILDING FAITH. THIS RESTORED TRUTH BUILDS OUR FAITH. GIVES US FAITH TO BE THE sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without it, we're jumping through hoops, religious hoops all the time. &gt;&gt; But this this revelation brings us into a rest. And when you come into a rest, &gt;&gt; guess what? &gt;&gt; When sheep rest, they bear wool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they eat good food, &gt;&gt; drink good water, and rest under A SHEPHERD'S CARE, WHAT COMES OUT? WOOL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; A HIGHER MORAL LIFE, &gt;&gt; A BETTER CONDUCT AMONGST PEOPLE, FAMILIES THAT ARE PUT. WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE NATURAL OUTCROPPING OF A REVELATION OF WHO YOU ARE and what THE WORD IS ALL ABOUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN.
