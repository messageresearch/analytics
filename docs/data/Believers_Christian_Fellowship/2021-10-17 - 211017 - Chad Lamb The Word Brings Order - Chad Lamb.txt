with levi yoder and his family and the group over there and some that he's invited so we'll be leaving right after service we'll get a quick bite and head right over and then have service right when we get there so if you could just remember us in prayer this afternoon we would very much appreciate that let's um take a look here at revelation chapter 4 and i would like to begin reading in verse 1. after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne you could have your seats may the lord ask rich at his blessing to the reading of his word and may he bless us as we move forward amen then i'd like to continue reading i'll read verse 3 again and continue from there and he that sat was to look upon like jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an m room and round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come and when these beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created amen it was a long opening scripture reading but but there's a reason behind it amen and i i don't know how many knew but last week last friday morning and saturday morning i i was asked to do a minister's meeting for some brothers in india through zoom and so i'd never done that before i didn't really want to do that i just it makes me nervous to do something like that and so brother franco was good he helped me with that and pulled that off and it went really well and so when they asked me to do it i already had a busy weekend that last weekend and i thought that i was too busy to do it but when when he asked god dropped in my heart that i should do it so i knew that i was to do it and then then i asked him and i didn't ask him they told me what the subject was and they said the subject was church order and i thought church order there's so many fun things that we could talk about and so i was just for just for a brief moment i i was a little disappointed i thought you know there's so many things that are so exciting and so many end time things and so much of the book of revelation and and i was i was i was actually discouraged because god had already dropped in my heart i'm supposed to do this and they want me to do church order and i'm thinking don't you come be quiet in the sanctuary like there's got to be something funner than this but as i sat there i got off the phone it was it was it was like 12 30 to 1 o'clock in the morning when i talked to brother rashaan and when i got off the phone all of a sudden inspiration started coming and my thoughts started lining up a certain way and god really just he really he was really gracious to me and all of a sudden i got a totally different perspective on church order and i taught it you know the way the lord had laid it on my heart taught it there that friday morning and that saturday morning of last week but i really had it on my heart to share it with you all because it was such a blessing for me you know how many times i i always ask the why behind the why like why why do these things matter why are they important why why did the prophet preach on it and teach on it there's a reason behind it and i feel like god started to line my thinking up and i got a bigger picture of church order so i'm actually not going to talk about church order i'm going to talk about the the the purpose behind it amen and i just titled this the word brings order and and when i begin to look here in revelation chapter 4 uh john he has a special privilege and in this privilege there's a door open in heaven and he he is allowed to go in and see the heavenly order in the throne room of god and we find out that the throne room of god is in order there's a certain order amen there's certain positions there's places there's offices there's jobs there's roles is that right so first i begin to see that heaven is an order there's a certain order to heaven and what god has done and what god has orchestrated is in order it's not in chaos but it's an order and every every created creature in heaven at least in this vision of the throne room we have everything is created for a purpose and it is serving its purpose in the throne room of god we have four living creatures they have a purpose we have 24 elders they have a purpose everything there that we have seven spirits of god before the throne they have a purpose so they have a position they have a place and they have a purpose and they're each one working according to their purpose but you realize that that that when we start to look at this and you start to look at seraphims and cherubims and angels of a heavenly host and order and rank and file and 24 elders and seven spirits of god and we start to see all that's there and all the positions and places one thing began to become evident to me that there's one focal point for everything and the focal point is the one who's sitting on the throne so every all the order and all the positions and all the roles everything is all centered around the one sitting on the throne so that the one sitting on the throne has preeminence and so everybody or every creature is operating in their role doing what they're supposed to do when they're supposed to do it as they're called to do it and it's all it's all bringing glory and honor to one and it's the one who sits on the throne so the focal point of heaven is the one sitting on the throne and everything is in order and at the pinnacle of that order you could say the center of the order or the pinnacle of the order however you want to hone it down it all comes to one and that's the one who sits on the throne so i begin to realize that earth has to be in order because heaven's in order because every this is supposed to be a reflection of heaven so the church must be in order amen because now he has a judgment seat he has a place where the one who sat on the throne there wants to sit on the throne in your heart amen he wants to rule and reign in this church and in order to do so there has to be an order amen because there was an order there there has to be an order here and so it needs to be a reflection and so if we can keep that in mind and begin to move from there let's go back to genesis yeah this little thought as it began to unfold as it unfolded in my heart as i went down through the scriptures it i just began to enjoy it so much and and i was so excited about bringing and sharing it with you today it's simple there's nothing complicated about it but for me it just put my heart in order it just straightened out my thinking and put everything in perspective and i enjoyed it so much so we're just going to walk through the bible this morning and look at god's order in genesis 1 verse 1 it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and brother branham says now that everything in heaven in that constellation if one of those stars would move i know you go out at night and say i seen a star shoot no you've seen a weather light a star don't move if that star would move we would we would move with it everything in heaven is so much in harmony it holds one another together and something brother venom tells us that that god when god began to create the the heavenlies amen he says there was a great ball like sun and off of that would come a little clinker amen and he said it would keep moving and for thousands of years or however long it would move and move and finally he would say stop hold right there and it would stop and hold right there and another come off and another come on and he says what's he doing he's writing his first bible and brother branham tells us that each one of those uh heavenly bodies they differ one from another and the scripture tells us the same thing that they differ one from another in brightness and size and distance from the earth and perspective from our position but it was all for a purpose god wasn't doing anything random there was no chaos in the creation the creation was ordered it was ordered by the word of god and when god would speak it would begin to move when god would say stop it would stop when god told to hold its place it would hold its place and it became amen the word of god in manifestation because he's writing his first bible and brother ben tells us now if one of those would get out of place it would bring chaos upon the earth and when it brings chaos upon the earth he's saying it must hold its position it must hold its place but this is what he said he said everything in heaven is so much in harmony it holds one another together so that it means none of these bodies are independent from one another amen they're all holding each other in place and they're all amen in their position holding one another in position and what are they doing they're declaring the glory of god day by day night by night they are declaring the glory of god so if they would begin to move it would bring chaos he says in uh marriage and divorce we find out that everything in the beginning was running in perfect order and harmony with god nothing was out of cater everything in heaven is still in order all the stars the galaxies the solar system everything is perfectly in order and if one of them move it would interrupt the whole program that is so amazing because if you think about what was taking place in heaven when john saw the vision of the throne room of god amen what would happen if if one of the burners refused to be the burners the seraphim's the one that would took the coal off of the uh uh off the altar and go and touch the lips of the prophet isaiah what if one of the 24 elders tried to do that job and what if they were fighting over the tongues i want to do it no that's my job no i want to do it but see heaven is in order everybody has their place everybody has their position and they stay in place and there's a harmony around the throne of god and when there's a harmony around the throne of god there's true worship and it's reflecting the one who's being worshipped that's why if you worship in chaos what are we reflecting the one who's being worshipped what if the you know the the four living creatures were you know there's only three of them that day because the fourth one decided he was tired of saying holy holy holy every day holy holy holy and i'm tired and i want to go sit and he trades places 124 elders i want to sit on a seat for a while you go okay holy holy holy see it's it's funny to talk about it's nonsense to talk about but it's the reality they had to hold their positions so that god would be glorified and god was glorified their worship was reflecting back the glory of god let's go back to genesis chapter 1 again and let's continue reading in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters so we find now brother of them tells us we find in genesis 1 2 we find earth in a state of judgment and brother remember said chaos state of chaos a state of judgment so when god created the earth he didn't create it in chaos we saw as brother benham shows us the ordering of the heavens amen they weren't created in chaos they were ordered step by step everything moved by the spoken word of god then it got in its position to do what god intended for it to do and it has to stay there or it brings the whole thing into disruption so now we find upon the earth the earth has been in chaos and now it's in a form of judgment and when we look at this and brother ben tells us that it was in chaos then you realize something happened between genesis 1 1 and 1 2 because god didn't make it that way because the word of god does not bring chaos the word of god brings order so that's how brother branham knows and can allude to the fact that something happened upon the earth something happened that would bring chaos amen and something that would the only thing that i know that would bring chaos is when something got out of position with the word of god and began began a perversion of the word of god and when that happened it broke chaos and now judgment and now we find the earth in a state of judgment after chaos amen and the word of god now is going to go forth and it's going to turn the chaos into paradise and how's he going to use it he's going to order it by his word so when we stay with the word and the word has preeminence there's order amen when we leave the word amen things break out into chaos so when you see order amen you recognize that the word of god is bringing a certain order when you see the order disrupted you can recognize there's another something working to bring chaos in god's order he says verse 3 and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god the light divided the light from the day and god called the light day and he called the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and we're not going to keep reading through that because we know how he orders it but it's ordered by a spoken word and brother brahm tells us he's taking from chaos to eden to paradise to perfection by his spoken word let's go to chapter 2 verse 8. and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and a river went out of eden to water the garden from thence it was parted and became into four heads the name of the first is paisan which is that is which compasses the whole land of havala where there is gold and the gold of that land is good there's bedellium and onyx stone and the name of the second river is jihan and then and the same is the that compasses the whole land of ethiopia and the name of the third river is hedekel which is that which goeth toward the east of assyria in the fourth river as euphrates and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it so god created earth by a spoken word he created eden which was his pleasure and then he created the garden of eden and in the garden of eden he placed his man amen his creation a man in his own likeness after his own image and he places that man and he puts that man in authority over all of this creation he makes him a god upon the earth he is he is a son of god and now he's operating as god upon the earth and god gives him dominion over all the earth and he is told to dress it and to keep it is that right this man is told to dress it and to keep it and keep this word keep means to like to guard it amen like if there's a keep it's a place of safety like a prison is called a keep and he's here to keep it he's here to dress it and he's here to keep it and it's interesting that god tells this man who is made after his own image after his own likeness who's created and now he he puts him in a body of flesh so that he can be with the creation as a god over this creation so he can interact with the creation because we know at first he was like a spirit over it all like the holy spirit but now he's in flash to be with his creation and now with his creation interacting with the creation he's ordered to keep it so why why is he ordered to keep it amen it's interesting that god had already made a creation upon the earth and it's as if that creation wasn't kept something happened between genesis 1 1 and 1 2. what happened is still a mystery we don't know but something happened that threw it into chaos and i ask you every time something goes in the chaos what happened i'll tell you what happened something happened to the word somebody left the word or perverted the word or or did something to the word amen and it brought chaos and so now we know from from perfect perfect from the hand of god to chaos now spoken word brings it back into perfection and he puts his son over it all and tells him to to address it and to keep it so now the keeping of all of this is up to adam and brother brahm says in god's power to transform now the headquarters with his son and his son's bride over all it looks so perfect there was a man the head of it all his own son and his bride and every seed was perfect the palms and and the oaks and the grass and the birds and the animals and everything was in perfect order with the commandment of god what was keeping it in perfect order the word when god said you're a this that's what it always was a palm tree was always a palm tree there was no hybridization until man got involved a hybrid and it was an order according to the commandment of god and man was told to address it and keep it let's look at chapter 2 verse 16. and the lord god commanded the man saying every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die so man was told to dress the garden and keep it and he did so for a period of time we don't know how long that was where he is god upon the earth he kept it under the order of god's word amen he kept it under the commandment of god but he was he was given a commandment he was given a church order all right the church order in the garden of eden was you may eat of every tree but of this tree you may not eat of that and so adam was given a church order and the church order was for a purpose amen and that and that purpose was to keep the word preeminent because we know what that tree of knowledge and good and evil was and we know what it did and what it did was corrupt the word of god so the church order was to bring preeminence back to the word and keep the word in preeminence keep the word and rulership over it all amen but a serpent would come anointed of the devil to beguile the woman and begin to entice her to take of that tree what was she doing she was breaking her church order and so now we're not talking about chewing gum friends now we're talking about amen everything was centered everything in heaven there was a focal point in heaven and it was the one who sat on the throne amen and he was the word the word it was god the word was with god amen god was the originator of the word the word emanated from god and in the heavenly throne room he's the focal point of the whole order all the order points back to him and all the order reflects him and now on earth there's a creation in the heavens and on earth that is reflecting his nature reflecting his character and it's ordered by his word and now he has a son that's to reflect his character to reflect his nature and that son is given an order to keep and that son now fails to keep the order and when he fails to keep the order what happened to perfection amen perfection was broken hybridization entered in chaos broke out upon the earth and we are looking at the effects of it now in 2021 we are looking at the effects of adam not keeping it in order it was all ordered to the commandments of god but when man let down on the word amen what happened chaos began to set in and what god had built to continue on begins to decay what god had built to last amen and doesn't last anymore amen now it falls into ruin and it begins to decay because man didn't keep his church order praise god i hope by the time we get done with this church order is going to make so much sense that nobody has to tell us anything anymore we just understand why god orders things the way he orders them now after chaos is broke out amen what eve did not understand that day when she was being enticed to take her that tree she couldn't understand what was wrong with it it looked good it was good to make you wise it was good for food like she and herself could not discern what was wrong with that thing but god had told her to stay away from it amen but her discernment failed her intellect failed her her wisdom her eyesight her senses they all failed her and when she failed to keep the church order when she failed to keep the word amen chaos broke out and i can imagine after she realizes the the extent of that fall and what it would cost her and as she brings more child and pain how she has to be clothed her husband now has to earn bread by the sweat of his brow she watches one son slay another son how long did it take before she realized i should have kept the church order i should have kept the word because the the order is always about keeping the word in preeminence that if there's nothing else you catch today i want you to catch this the order of god is about keeping the word in preeminence the order in heaven was about keeping the one on the throne and preeminence the order on earth was about keeping the the one who gave the word and preeminence and now the order that we walk under amen is to keep that word in preeminence and when they failed everything fell under his jurisdiction and the world has been going back into chaos if you read the papers and look at the news and realize that we're in chaos the world is in chaos and why is it in chaos it has nothing to do with a pandemic it has everything from leaving god's order we're in chaos because we left god's order and man is so rapidly leaving the order of god's word that chaos is breaking out everywhere there's no restraints anymore there's no hold on it anymore chaos is rampant amen what you look at the chaos and the chaos and governments the chaos and finance the chaos and medicine i mean everything is just chaotic amen nothing is stable anymore there there's no place of stability there's nothing that's sure we have no confidence that things will be tomorrow like they are today amen everything is shifting everything is moving everything is fluid nothing is solid anymore you agree with that in the world's perspective from the world's perspective everything is moving amen in it it's a direct correlation with leaving the order of god because if you stay with the order of god's word you have a firm foundation you have a solid rock to stand upon amen my word will not return to me void it'll accomplish that which i said there's a definite purpose like you stay with the word of god and you stay with the order of god things don't shift things don't change things don't move the storm comes they beat against the house but the house doesn't move because it's founded upon a rock that's why the church was supposed to be based on a rock founded upon a rock the rock of revelation of who jesus christ is because that doesn't move it doesn't change with the times it doesn't shift so so the order brought stability the order that god placed the mother brought security the order that they were placed on him provided everything for them because the order kept the word in preeminence and the word and preeminence kept everything in order but when they failed to keep the word in preeminence everything fell out of order let's turn to numbers chapter 2. like i said i just want to roll through the bible i don't want to stay in any one place too long there's many points that we want to hit so just keep your bibles handy and we'll turn some pages and march through as the lord leads numbers chapter 2 verse 1 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying every man of the children of israel shall pitch by his own standard with the inside of their father's house far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch and on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of judah pitch throughout their armies and nation the son of amin of them shall be captain of the children of judah and his hosts and those that are numbered of them were three scorer and 14 and 600 and those that do pitch next unto them shall be the tribe of issachar and nathaniel the son of azur shall be captain of the children of issachar and his hosts and those that are were numbered thereof were 50 or were 50 and 4 thousand and 400 then the tribe of zebulun and the iliad the son of helan shall be captain of the children of zebulun and his hosts and those that were numbered there were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred and all that were numbered in the camp of judah were a hundred thousand and four score thousand and six thousand and four hundred throughout their armies these shall first set forth so i don't want to go on and read because there's a lot of details i just wanted to read the first part so you caught how many details there were there there's no quiz so i'm not going to ask any questions but here we have moses in the exodus he's bringing a people amen a people that had a promise children of abraham with a promise that was given to abraham that they shall have a land but they according to the word they were so joining in a strange land for 400 years but this was the time of them being delivered with a mighty hand and god was moving them out of slavery he's moving them as a people and he was calling out a people and he brought them into the wilderness but when he brought them into the wilderness he has a prophet there and he tells that prophet to order the people there was now can you imagine when they first moved out amen these people were living in goshen they were they had been slaves they were in bondage they had first liberty and freedom and they lost liberties and they lost more liberties and they lost more freedoms until they became in bondage and became they came into slavery amen under the system of egypt but now god is bringing them out of that system and as he brings them out of that system and then when they first walk out amen they're a ragtag group of people and they've got whatever animals they could grab whatever they had whatever they borrowed off of neighbors they borrowed all kinds of vessels and pots and instruments and gold and silver and raymen and they were grabbing the spoils out of egypt and they were throwing it over their shoulders their children's shoulders on their ox car who knows how they carried it or how they went out but they went out they met a multitude of people amen they didn't have a standard they didn't have a marching order they didn't have a structure they were just people that went forth in the exodus and they get out into the wilderness and and how do they camp i mean when you go out there in the wilderness i guess everybody just pitched a tit wherever they felt like pitching a tent and you know these are they're all mixed up and they have tents everywhere and i mean there there's probably no grid pattern so you can walk between them nicely i mean it wasn't laid out like a city planter would like to see it laid out but god would not allow that to stay in chaos because now he was bringing a people out and these were his chosen people and this nation was going to reflect him and so god tells moses you structure the people and he goes down to the details this is the one he'll camp on the east side there'll be two tribes that will camp with him amen there'll be another chief amend standard that will that will be on the west side and the south and the north and there'll be two tribes that go with them the levites will be here they will be set up in this pattern when they break camp the first one to go forth with judah after them will be this group and after them with his this group when they go to battle they'll go in this order amen when you pitch the tent you'll pitch it this way when you set up the tabernacle first you'll do this and second you'll do that and third you'll do that and you'll do it in a certain order amen then you'll camp in a certain order and you'll be structured in a certain way and and can you imagine the first day that the instructions go out and everybody's trying to find oh now everybody in judah's got to get together there's there's only about 2 million or so people i mean this can't be real difficult and some of judah was with israel and they were just scattered now now after the commandment comes they've got to all come they've got to congregate together there's a captain over them and this captain i tell you what i wouldn't want to be that captain that day who wants to be in charge of this mess we got to get no no you come over here no you you're not here you're over there what are you doing i've already told you but god told moses and moses had to get the people and he got the captain of each tribe and in position and they gave the orders and the orders have to go from the top down and when you get done and you have the tabernacle in the middle you've got the outer court you've got the holy place you've got the holy of holies everything's structured the mercy seats in place the levites are there to serve amen and then when you look down from heaven you've got the lion the ox and the man and the eagle you've got the same thing on earth that's reflecting what's in heaven and they're all round about the throne of god that's now on earth in that tabernacle god ordered by his word and the ordering of the nation of israel was reflecting the throne room in heaven and that order put the central focus of the entire camp of israel on the one who sits upon the throne it made the word preeminent it made the word giver preeminent it put god in his place when they got an order so there was a church order in eden that put god in this place there was a church order in the wilderness that put god in its place i hope you're starting to see church order is not about chewing gum and talking in church it's about giving the word preeminence it's about putting god in his place he ordered the service of the tabernacle they couldn't just worship god any way they wanted to worship god everything was set to match the throne room there was an approach to god and it was all crying holiness unto the lord and the levites had to be chosen not anybody could do what they were to do and certain levites were ordered to certain things and one family of the family of aaron was ordered to be the priest and then the high priest nobody could take anybody else's place everybody had to do it the way god said and when we did it the way god said amen they saw the pillar of fire they saw the cloud they saw the presence of god is in the camp why because they got the church order right and when they got the order right it put amen the focus upon the one who's sitting on the throne and his presence remained among them as long as they kept it right praise god let's go to first kings chapter 10. first kings chapter 10. first kings 10 and 4 and when the queen of sheba has seen all solomon's wisdom and the house that he built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers and their apparel and his cup bearers and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in my own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom howbeit i believe not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and my prosperity exceeded the fame which i heard happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom here comes the queen of sheba amen brother baby said the heathen queen she's now coming in and solomon here his ministry at the pinnacle of of his kingdom amen it's a type of jesus christ in the millennium when he takes the throne of david and orders it in the millennium and you have to ask yourself what will the millennium be like will it be chaos or will it be order there'll be a church order in the millennium we know there's a church order because if egypt does not come at the feast of tabernacles they'll not get any rain so there's a church order even over in the millennium so now solomon is here and solomon under solomon's ministry he puts everything in order and when the queen of sheba sees the cup bearers and and the attendants and the servants and the apparel in the house and the order and she sees what is she looking at she's looking at everything this is what god had raised up a kingdom for amen to reflect him he had solomon on the throne which was a son of david which was the son of god he was reflecting the coming kingdom amen it was a reflection of god's order and solomon amen before he fell away he comes to this pinnacle amen of an expression of what god wanted to express giving the word preeminence in every way and when he did a minute took her breath away there was no more spirit in her when she saw how ordered everything was there was no chaos in the kingdom of solomon there was no chaos in his house there was no chaos with his attendance and he said happier the men that serve happier these that get to hear thy wisdom they were all in place they were all in position they were all doing something for the king amen and they were happy in their service and when she saw everybody in position everybody in place she saw the way they served they it was perfect amen solomon i'll tell you i don't think solomon had the guy with two left hands and five thumbs on each hand he probably wasn't the one serving him a cup it wasn't the guy who spilled a drink every time he filled it the queen of sheba wouldn't have had no more spirit in her she would have probably been like this is nuts this is chaos if the wrong one was in the wrong position and there wasn't order and they didn't serve on time and the meal was laid and the food was cold and the apparel wasn't in the right order and somebody had to quickly jump in somebody else's position to pull off the meal just think about what's being said and think that solomon had his kingdom in order and when the the order of the kingdom amen when queen of sheba came and she saw the structure the order amen the way they served there was no more spirit in her and she said i heard of thy fame i heard of thy reputation but the half was not told onto me this is something you have to see amen i heard about it but this is amazing and of course the queen of sheba would understand what it would take to get attendance like that to get service like this to get everything running smooth she was a queen when this queen saw the order of this king's court in his home amen she had no more spirit in her she was the one who could testify this is beyond what a man can do this is unbelievable solomon had order i'd like quickly to flip over to chronicles and look at chronicles and then come back he said i'm not going to preach a long time on any of these i'm going to hit several things several examples and keep moving because you could stay on each one of these a long long time and we've preached on these before and spent ben spent hours on them like brother ben said you can take just one of those seals and go around and around that clock but i just want to hit these things and move first chronicles 15 and verse 11. when we get to this part of of chronicles first chronicles 15 verse 11 david had already tried to bring the ark of the covenant to him he brought it on ox carts and when it the oxen had stumbled and the cart had rocked uzziah yuza had put his hand to steady and he was smitten dead and david calls a cancellation to the whole works and he puts it on hold and now he's gonna come back and now it's time to try it again and he says in verse 11 and david called for zodiac and abby athar the priest and for the levites for urel assaya and joelle shemiyah and elial and aminadab and said unto them you are the chief of the fathers of the levite sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that you may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that i have prepared for him for because i did it not at the first the lord our god made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the dew order so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel and the children of the levites bear the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereof as moses commanded according to the word of the lord and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments and music sultries and harps and symbols sounding by lifting up their voice with joy david had recognized his desire was right his sincerity was right what he was wanting to accomplish was right but he says here that we sought him not after the dew order and the due order was for the levites to carry the ark but he had put it on a cart because it came back to them on a cart from the philistines so because the philistines had done it that way and it got there they just continued what the philistines were doing and they had to stop and go back to what moses had instructed and then and david was just carrying it on the way that it came to him and and somebody had died in the process but he says we didn't do it according to the due order and because it wasn't according to the due order amen it brought chaos it brought death something didn't work right so now he backs it up and says let's do it according to the do order and now there was rejoicing now there was singing now because god wants things in order amen he wants his church in order he wants his people in order amen he wants you and i in order brother and sister he wants us amen he wants us to do what we were called to do he wants us to do what we've been predestinated to do he wants us to be amen the cup bearer and the attendant and the and all the things that that was in solomon's temple so he learned david learned that it must be done and do order even though the desire is right and and the motive is right it's got to be right first kings let's go back to first kings chapter 7. verse 48 first kings 7 48 and solomon made all the vessels that pertained into the house of the lord in the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the shoe bread was and the candlesticks of pure gold five on the right and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold and the bowls and the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and the sensors of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the temple so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of the lord and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated even the silver and gold and the vessels that he put among the treasures of the house of the lord i read this for a reason because i wanted you to see when it come time for solomon to build the temple or yeah build the temple of god amen david wanted to build it but solomon had to do it he was the one commissioned to do it and so he he builds it but when he builds it there's so many things that have to be in place things that we don't think about we think about putting the stones in place and getting the curtains in place and the big pieces of furniture but he's got to do spoons and snuffers and bowls and this and this and this and this and this and solomon has to work and get everything in its place because when it comes to the temple worship there's a lot of pieces there's a lot of instruments there's a lot of tools there's a lot of things and everything has to be done and everything has to be put in order solomon wasn't marching forward and say hey we got the building done let's just go ahead and start having church he had to get the bowls and the snuffers and the and he was in the pipes and he's not saying ah it's just a snuffer i mean we'll find something to use until we get it done you see there was a certain order there was certain structure there was an order of the lord and everything had to go in the right order and when it went in the right order we're going to find that god blessed it very much let's look over at verse 8 chapter 1. then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes of the chief of the fathers of the children of israel and king solomon in jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord of the city of david which is zion and all the men of israel assembled themselves into king solomon at the feast in the month of ethnim which is the seventh month and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark then they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle even those did the priest and the levites bring up and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude and the priest brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord and to the place and to the oracle the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this day there was nothing in the ark say the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt and it came to pass when the priests were coming out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the lord so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord solomon that spends a long time if you read it there's a lot that goes into this building they meant all the stones were hewn off-site they meant so it was quiet in place every stone was shaped differently but had a place that it fitted we had a predetermined place to fit it was already made to fit and it was predetermined where it would fit and when it come together it made and that's a type of the church of god amen we're living stones lively stones built into a spiritual habitation of god and gone by us shaped different amen with different gifts different abilities different makeups god is piecing us together to make this tabernacle but there's a lot that goes to it amen there's a lot of pieces there's a lot of word that comes together and solomon if you read it there's a lot i mean he's working and he's laboring and they're getting this and they've got to get timber from a certain place in stones from another it all has to come together i mean we think we have supply chain issues today i think solomon had supply chain issues but he was able to solve them and everything came together then on the tabernacle was built and they made every little intricate piece everything was woven just right the tapestry was right the the instruments were right they were in the right place there was nothing out of place amen he didn't have the snuffer where the bowl goes in the bowl where he had it all when he got it all in place and everything was right and when they come and they put the word back in place amen when the word took the central spot when the word took the chief see when they brought the word with the two tables of stone and the ark and put god's seat back in place over the word amen the glory of the lord came and filled the place so that they couldn't minister well they couldn't minister anymore that was the goal of building the whole thing in the first place so that god could come in and god could fill his house so the presence of god would be amongst them the ministers weren't disappointed when they couldn't minister anymore that was the whole point of ordering everything was for god god was so pleased when everything was done he brought his presence in and the cloud filled the place and so the ministers had to leave amen god was there what got him there amen they kept the order of the lord they did it according to the way they were told everything was brought in place and it all went back to preeminence to the word and when the word got the preeminent spot in the entire structure god came down that's the point of our church order friends the point of our church order every one of us and everything we do and when we come to church the way we come the way we dress the way we sing the way we approach everything we do it's all for one purpose so that every vessel every tool every piece of instrument every servant can get in the right place so that we can put the word in preeminence and we work the word in preeminence god will bless us with his presence the order it wasn't about a snuffer amen the snuffer was part of it but it wasn't the snuffer amen it wasn't the priest he was part of it but it wasn't the priest it wasn't the stone that was part of it but it wasn't stone the whole thing had to come together because the whole point was this has to be a dwelling place for god almighty and god won't dwell until everything's in place praise god let's go to first kings 18. first kings 18. verse 30. this is elijah of mount carmon and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the son of jacob unto whom the lord the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order he didn't throw the wood up there if we just pause for a minute he didn't take 10 stones 11 stones 13 stones he took the right number of stones and he rebuilt the altar of the lord he was bringing it back to its original condition because the elijah ministry brings us back to the original word and this elijah brings back the order of the 12 tribes our elijah brought back the order of the seven church ages so this one's working with a nation the next one's working with the church and he rebuilds he brings back to its former state he's re he's getting it back in order he's putting the altar he's restoring worship back properly he brings it back to the right order he gets the right number of stones and i believe he put him in the right spot that's me the bible doesn't say that but i believe he got him in the right spot because this elijah got each church age in the right spot and and now he doesn't just throw the wood he puts the wood in order i love this i mean that suits my nature really well anyways and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill full four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrificing on the wood and he said do it the second time they did it the second time and he said do it the third time they did it the third time and the water ran down about the altar and filled the trench also with water and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice see elijah didn't do this any earlier because it had to be at the time of the evening sacrifice elijah had to restore everything in the evening time and this is very significant we've preached on it before but we don't have time to go into great details but it had to be at the time of the evening sacrifice and at the time and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word he didn't do it by the way he felt by what he thought was best what looked nice what would be the nicest way to do this the best order for the wood the best place with these stones the number of stones i like he did everything at god's word and when he finished putting it all in order he said hear o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god that thou has turned their heart back what was the point to turn their hearts back amen because elijah and our day come to turn our hearts back to the original faith of the pentecostal fathers so what was he doing god was going to turn their hearts back but first he had to send the prophet amen who could rebuild the original altar the original worship coming back bringing back the 12 tribes amen because we had to have an alliance that would bring us back to the original worship to bring us back amen to the full measure of the seven church ages and everything was in order and everything was done according to order and he testified at the time of the evening sacrifice i've done all these things that thy word verse 38 then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god listen elijah wasn't doing things haphazardly and he wasn't doing things according to the way that he felt was best he was doing he was fulfilling the word of the lord he was letting the word guide him and the word was putting everything in order and he put everything in order according to the word and when he got everything in order according to the word and he came to the right time the time of the evening sacrifice he declares now lord i've done all this at this word now show to the people that you're turning their hearts back and the fire from heaven came down and consumed it all the stones the dust the water the sacrifice the wood everything he had was consumed by the presence of god because elijah had set it in order he had did it according to the word because when the word was given preeminence the first place the presence of god was there it was important that he did it right let's go to luke chapter 9. these things have all been preached on before we've heard them here i preached them other brothers here have preached them but i just want to put them in this context i want to line them out in this order as the lord dropped him in my heart luke chapter 9. and verse 12. luke chapter 9 and verse 12 and when the day began to wear away then came to 12 and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into town and country and the towns and country round about and lodge and get vittles for we are here in a desert place but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this people and they were about 5 000 men and he said it to his disciples make them sit down by 50s in a company and they did so and made them all sit down then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looked up to heaven he blessed them and break and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of the fragments that remain to them 12 baskets here jesus he he finds that there's a people who's hungry and the disciples and recognize that people are hungry they have a need they need to eat amen and and they say send them away and he says no you feed them and he's looking at the disciples as you feed them and these disciples have no ability to feed this multitude they say all we have is these few fishes and these few loaves and we we don't have the ability to feed these people put on your spiritual jackets the disciples can't feed the people any more than a pastor can feed the sheep on his own any more than a minister can feed the children of god the bread of god amen unless it goes that little bit that he has goes into christ's hands and when christ breaks the bread now there's going to be a multiplication of the little gift that a brother has and so now he tells the disciples first before he does anything he says make them sit in companies of 50. there was 5 000 and one account says 5 000 men besides women and children listen 5 000 men plus women and children and jesus doesn't say anything to the people he tells the disciples you make them sit in companies of 50. now listen in that group of 5 000 people you had every personality type imaginable you had submissive nature's bold natures rebellions rebellious zealots anti-government intrusion super submissive and timid you had it all we've got some deacon brothers here i'd like to ask them how many of you would want to make that group sit by 50s how many would you like that to be your responsibility it couldn't be 48 and 52 49 and 51 then there was families and there was friends but i don't want to sit over there i want to sit here please sir i need you to sit over here because we're not going to eat until we get 50 in each company how do i know you're telling me the truth i never heard him say that listen you've got to trust me we've got to sit by 50 so we all can eat i'm hungry too i want to eat two but he told me that we've got to get you to sit in 50s and if you'll just cooperate if we'll all work together we'll eat faster then as it takes longer is it ever going to happen you promised me we're going to eat i've been sitting in my group of 50 now for an hour listen i'm sorry we have to get everybody in groups of 50. i'm so glad i wasn't a disciple that day john was the youngest but i bet he aged a few years then you come back and somebody's moved from this group to this group you're like no listen that won't work you got to go back where i asked you to stay and see the disciples couldn't do this by force there had to be a cooperation because you know these this small number of disciples cannot forcibly make 5 000 men plus women and children sit in groups of 50 there's got to be a cooperation between the people and the disciples they have to trust that the disciples have heard from the lord they have to trust that they're doing this for their own good and we all get in this thing together and when we all get in together we can make this process simple or we can make it difficult and finally i don't know how long it took i don't know what all was involved but they finally got them to sit in companies of 50 and then jesus takes that little bit that they had that was insufficient but because they obeyed his commandment and there was a cooperation between the ministry and between the people amen he began to break the bread and when he broke the bread jesus did not give bread to anyone he gave bread to his disciples and he told the disciples to distribute it to the people and listen these people are already just a little restless from getting in groups of 50. some have suspicion about these disciples how do you know that brother chad i'll trade jobs with you for a few years and you'll know it too because people are people our people are people coming with baskets the disciples say here you can have you can have some but there's plenty for everyone how do i know grab grab grab grab them stuff it under my arm stuff how will i know you're not going to give it to your favorite people how do i know there had to be a cooperation and they would carry around this multiplication and no doubt they were going back for more because i don't know how they carried this multiplied they had baskets because they they picked them up in baskets at the end 12 basketballs so maybe each one of them had a basket but that basket wouldn't do i mean a thousand people so they they did the basketball and no doubt they had to turn around and go back to the lord and get more but how would you like to be in the group of 50 next to that group of 50 and you saw the basket just went empty and you told me if i sit in this group of 50 that i was going to eat and you don't have no more listen just hold on i don't have any more but i'm going to go back to the one who gave me this and he'll give me more for you please stay in your group of 50 please don't get up don't move please oh i feel sorry for the disciples and at the end of it they all ate and were filled at the end of this exercise they all ate until they could eat no more they were filled and there was a surplus of 12 baskets left over just in case anybody was nervous that the lord was not going to be sufficient and then if he gave a commandment to do something a certain way that it wouldn't work he left 12 baskets full so each of those disciples had a basket full left over to prove if you do it my way you'll never lack if you do it according to my word they'll always be more than what you need there'll be an abundance left over if you'll just come god's provided way and we could just cooperate together amen and trust one another if the people could trust the disciples the disciples could work with the people they couldn't force them there they had to shepherd them there can you imagine a few disciples 5 000 people it wouldn't take long even the women and children could tear them to pieces it had to be a cooperation they had to be gentle they had to be honest they had to talk to the people they had to convince them that what they were telling them was the truth the people had to believe them they had to sit down in groups of 50. then they had to wait till the lord broke the bread then they had to wait while it was distributed how long would it take to feed that many people i have no idea but it probably took a while and the people had to stay in position stay in their group and wait for the disciple to bring them the bread they couldn't go to jesus themselves and get it he told the disciples to bring it to him they had to trust the lord they had to trust this whole process but when they trust the process and they stayed in order and everything went according to god's word he proved how effective it is to just obey him by leaving 12 baskets left over praise be to god jesus could have just fed him jesus could have had food show up in their laps he could have had manna fall like dew and lay all around them on the ground but this is the way he wanted to do it it doesn't have to make sense it doesn't have to be it doesn't even have to be reasonable we just have to obey the lord let's go to first corinthians chapter 14. first corinthians 14 26 how is it then brethren when you come together every one of you have a psalm have a doctrine have a tongue have a revelation have an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most three and that by course and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself into god let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge if anything be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold us peace from you may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all the churches of the saints let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience is also saith the law if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues that all things be done decently and in order just as god ordered eden the garden of eden he put adam there to keep it now he comes in the wilderness and he wants to order the nation of israel and he wants them to keep their order and he tells moses and moses tells the people and moses now is ordering the church in the wilderness but then here comes a long paul and paul now is ordering the new testament church so i hope you're seeing a pattern all the way down through the scripture that god wants things done decently and in order that's god's way and i'd like to just inject this thought if i can brother better says in god identifying himself by his characteristics he said all right while the people line up i haven't got time to see who they are or what they are he's coming to a prayer line now but now all out there that knows that i don't know you raise up your hand say i have need of god but you don't know me brother brennan but i have need of god i'm just going to raise my hand now if you'll just settle for a few minutes watch be careful be quiet now i don't mean when i say be quiet if the lord does anything you want to praise the lord that's worship but what i mean just don't run around get up you know that's irreverent and the holy spirit is very timid very timid see just anything like that just leaves me and i just have to battle then again see but if if you'll listen brother bam is coming to a prayer line and there's people with great needs and he's asking for the cooperation of the people and he's trying to take their understanding to a higher order he's trying to get him not to get up and stir around and not to move about and not be talking and not be restless at this time because now he's coming to a prayer line and he says the holy spirit is very timid he says it twice very timid and he'll just leave me and then i've got to fight to get back and so here the prophet of god is asking for the cooperation of the people to keep the atmosphere right because the holy ghost is timid i hope we learn something from that the holy ghost is timid and he doesn't do well with chaos it's not his nature he has a different nature and the holy ghost doesn't deal with chaos he leaves that's what brother branham says he leaves he said in the message be not afraid of his eye now i'm just going to wait a moment i'm waiting for the audience to get quiet reverend the holy spirit is so timid oh just one little thing he will go away he will just leave me then i have to walk away brother's telling the people if if that holy ghost is not here i have to walk away and we leave the people sick and leave the people in need or he said before fight to get it back and he's teaching us a lesson about the nature of the holy ghost it's natured with a dove amen it's timid it can't take amen it can't take a rough atmosphere it can't take routine as it can't take the wrong spirit the wrong approach the wrong attitude he says in the token he says jesus was baptized by john and the bible said and when he saw the spirit of god like a dove coming down upon him therefore if i would have been if it would have been a wolf or if it would have been any other animal the nature of the dove could not have blended with the nature of the wolf neither could the nature of the dove blended with any other animal but the lamb and these two natures come together then they could agree with each other the brother of them takes us all the way back to jordan and shows that if there had been any nature there in jesus christ amen that that dove would not have rested upon him because paul was told whoever you see the holy ghost descend and remain upon right and if he would brother ben said if he would have snarled like a wolf and he snapped he would have taken his flight and so he had to have a complementary nature to work with and a complementary nature to the dove is the lamb is that right and so now the dove amen we we recognize all the way back in the ark amen when the dove and the crow were released the dove would go and could find no place to set its feet is that what it says because the dove is a clean animal and cannot set its feet on death and destruction and but the raven could set its feet on wheat and eat and the raven could set its feet on a bloated dead body and eat but the dove wasn't that kind of nature it could only rest its feet on something that was clean amen so out of the window it goes and no place to rest its feet it comes back and it goes again another time and it comes back amen with a with a leaf and it's a an olive leaf i think it is amen in its hand showing an olive leaf is also a type of the holy ghost showing that there's now life coming forth now i can rest upon life not upon death now there's something that i can rest my feet upon and now when when john is told the one you see the the holy ghost come upon and remain and he saw it like a dove in the form of a dove come down and remain upon jesus christ showing that there's no death here amen there's no chaos here there's if there had been chaos here it would have showed that that the serpent had been working somewhere there was no chaos he was in order he come in order to the word he came down to be baptized in obedience to the word and there was a complementary natures amen so the holy ghost could now come down and it could rest upon and remain upon this nature because it was the nature of the land but brother bam told us it wouldn't have matched with any other nature and we know the nature of the lamb brother ben tells us is submissive is that right it's timid it's soft it's it's vulnerable it needs a shepherd for leadership this is the nature this is the nature of a shepherd this is the nature of a of a sheep of a lamb amen and the dove and the lamb could come together but the dove and the wolf couldn't come together because the wolf snarls and snaps and takes what it's want and uses force and all of these but his sheep never does a lamb never does so he said these two things could come together and when we look at it in church order when we come together we want to have that kind of spirit among us the spirit of the lamb amen we're not here to have our own way we're not here to do it the way i like we're not here amen i can do what i want and if i and if i and if i want to stand out in the foyer and if i want to talk and not not listen to what the prophet said to come in early i can do what i want this is america that's not the nature of the lamb because the prophet encouraged us to get in here early to meditate to create an atmosphere to get yourself in the right atmosphere so you can wash away all the worldly wolf stuff because we want the timid holy ghost to come down and he only comes down in the right atmosphere with the right nature amen he doesn't come down amen upon chaos upon wolf natures and upon things like that so when the prophet of god amen begins to line us out in church order and begins to tell us come in early get quiet if you would like come to the altar and pray quietly go to your seat what your neighbor does that's up to them has nothing to do with you amen and he's saying just come right in come into the sanctuary he even encourages the people he's seen and another church where they come in 30 minutes early he liked it he told his church it would be good if we do that why that's not a law that's not something that has to be enforced but the lamb doesn't need enforcements he's submissive if the prophet said that would be good that would be good if you would do that and he explains why it's about creating an atmosphere brother branham's in church order he's trying to get the people amen to come to church prepared to come focus to come with one goal in one mind we're coming to church for one thing that's for the word to have preeminence in my life i'm coming together amen for the one who's sitting on the throne everything we're doing is pointing and reflecting to the one sitting on the throne so the word has preeminence among us so that the dove is welcome among us and so paul is telling everybody don't be in chaos don't be jumping up and saying this and doing that and everybody's got something they want to do he said let everything be done decently and in order so when brother is bringing his church order he's bringing us into the right nature he's bringing us into the right approach to god amen now it's not about i have to do this and i have to do that there's no half dues friends nobody's punishing anybody or banning anybody from the church because they don't keep brother ben's church that's not it it's all about the purpose what's the purpose what's the purpose what's the purpose it's because we want to come in orderly quiet ourselves have the right nature have the right atmosphere because the holy ghost is timid very timid and when brother brown says that he says quiet he is not talking about saying amen preach it brother he's not talking about clapping our hands and rejoicing he's not talking about singing and shouting he said that's worship that's in order that's correct he's not talking about any of that he's talking about anything else besides that to try to try to get us in the right atmosphere the right order like solomon brought in that day to get to get us in the right place in the right order and the right atmosphere because we want to welcome the presence of the lord let's go to first timothy chapter 3. first timothy chapter 3 verse 14. so these things i write unto you hoping to come unto you shortly but if i tear it along that thou mayest know how thou ought us to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of truth paul had to order the new testament church just like moses had to order the church in the wilderness and he wanted to know how they ought us to behave themselves in the house of god and it was all about the word having preeminence i want to read acts chapter 6 together if we could turn there and we're winding down just a few more scriptures i'd like to read a few more quotes acts chapter 6. acts chapter 6 verse 1 and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily administration then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men honest of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer to the ministry of the word and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and the holy ghost and philip and procurus and nicanor and and timmin and i hate reading names parminis and nicholas the proselyte of antioch whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company the priests were obedient to the faith this is the establishment of the office of deacons but i want us to recognize the purpose between the establishment of the office of deacons what was the purpose the purpose was so that the disciples the apostles can give themselves continually to the prayer and to the word it was to put the word in preeminence even the office of deacon is to keep the word in preeminence that's why brother baby says the deacon or the assistant to the pastor to help take care of things so that the ministry can focus on the word because it's all about having the word having preeminence so even the offices in the church is still about the same thing and if we keep the same focus we understand why do we have deacons why do we have trustees why do we have offices in the church it's all for the same purpose to keep the word in preeminence the very foundation of deacons was so that the ministry the apostles didn't get pulled away from prayer from fasting from the word to go tend to the needs of the people so they set up a group that would tend to the needs of the people so that they could stay focused amen on the word and when they stayed focused on the word it said in verse 7 and the word of god increased increased increase when they get it in order according to the what the apostles had established in this day the word increased not the number of people that increased to but the word increased and we want to give preeminence to the word so the word can increase so why do we have deacons so that the minister is free the pastor is more free to focus on the word the ministers can focus on the word so that the word will increase that's why we have deacons the deacons are instructed to keep keep the order of the sanctuary but you know it would be just as hopeless as that day those disciples had to had to set them down in 50s if there's not a cooperation if there's not a people who already understand why we want order in the sanctuary when you understand if i come according to the order if i come quietly if i come to the altar and pray go to my seat or sit in my seat and pray and open my bible and read quietly and prepare myself if i come decently if i come in order what am i doing i am preparing the way to get the word and preeminence amen and there's a cooperation there's not the deacons can't keep the order of the sanctuary if everybody in the sanctuary doesn't want to keep order so then the deacons are there for the newcomers the inexperienced the new to the faith right it's not their job to keep everybody in order it's everybody's job to stay in order that that responsibility belongs to all of us to stay in order because if we all stay in order there's a cooperation when there's a cooperation in every joint supply what do we want friends we want the word to increase we want the word to increase greatly if we want the word to increase then everybody has to cooperate i'm not preaching this because we don't have cooperation you all do great that's not the point i'm preaching it because i preached it to the ministers and i liked it so i'm just preaching what i preached to them we don't have any issues here but i'm just one i just wanted to show the purpose behind the purpose it's not it's not that the the deacons are out to get the teenagers and the teenagers right we don't have that issue that's not here but when we all understand what's trying to be accomplished and we all said we get on the same team we get on the same page we move in the same atmosphere we create the same atmosphere in the sanctuary brother bannon said that's why we don't have a bunch of singing and carrying on amen because you get the people all work wore out before the word comes brother branham in church already says that's why we don't have a bunch of singing and a bunch of carrying on a bunch of testimonies he said maybe if you're in a special meeting and have an outstanding testimony somebody got saved or something share that but not just a bunch of testimonies and testimony meetings he said i see those things get out of hand and the people get so wore out their wore out before the word comes so what's brother branham doing in the church or is he saying don't testify don't sing he's saying keep the main thing in focus and that's the preaching of the word all the church order is about the word having preeminence that's why when brother branham preached church order he said this is this is to branham tabernacle at such and such a number 8th street and 10th street so he's saying this church order is to this church because brother branham teaches the sovereignty of the local church because you can't take brother branham's church order and make it fit every church you have to be the same kind of people in the same kind of location with the same physical structure i told you this is brothers in india i went to church one time to a church an official church a gathering of people an official church in malawi and they gathered every sunday under a mango tree i said how do you put a deacon at each door when you have church under a mango tree how do you keep the kids from running through the sanctuary between services don't run by the mango tree see what brother branham was showing when we got to watch him set his church and ordered eighth and penn street he gave us an example he gave us a pattern he gave us something and we caught the purpose behind it now whether you have church in your home or you have church under a mango tree or you have church in a designated sanctuary you can take what the prophet brought and bring it in to accomplish the same purpose because your vision is higher than the rule because i've seen a whole lot of rule keeping that's nothing more than legalism and everybody feels good about the rule we kept all the rule but the dove wasn't welcome in that service and his feet didn't come down and rest so what was the point of keeping all the rules if the dove didn't come and the word didn't have preeminence we kept all the rules but we preached the false doctrine we didn't give the word preeminence so it's not about the rule it's about the concept it's about the principle about giving honor unto a prophet who is here to order the church to put the church back in order just like elijah put the put the worship back in order hey amen but the venom preaches over and over and over every church is sovereign and you cannot change that doctrine in the message brother branham preaches in church order he says well brethren i've appreciated being here with you tonight and brother neville to the deacons and trustees and sunday school superintendent all of you we trust that the lord will help you now carry out these orders for the kingdom of god the reason i have said this is because that i think you have grown from children to adults the reason he's preaching church order because he thinks he's grown from children to adults so the teaching of church order is you have to be mature when you was a child you talk like a child you understood as a child but now you're a man so let's act as adults in the house of god behave ourselves honoring our offices and honoring every office every gift that the lord has given us let's put it in order and honor god with our gifts and our offices praise be to god i think it's interesting to note that when brother venom comes to preach the seals he's coming to this week in march to preach the seals he's met the angels he's got his commission he knows what he's coming to those services to do but the first service he comes to is he preaches god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same and the very first thing he does is dedicate the church and remind the people of church order and he says it's not a dedication we did that 30 or 31 years ago it's a re-dedication because the church was dedicated on the day of pentecost but now we're coming to the seals to a rededication of the church and when he comes to the rededication of the church he goes into church order and starts teaching his old church order and giving people church order right here in god hiding himself in simplicity amen so what precedes the opening of the seals the preceding of the opening of the seals is dedication and church order and when you get dedication in church order right then comes forth the seals because it's all about putting the word in preeminence it's all about the one sitting on the throne church order is all about the one sitting on the throne and if we miss that amen we've missed church order brother benham he's hearing god hiding himself in simplicity he says now in the old tabernacle there might not be one person present this morning that was here the day of dedication when major ulrich played the music and stood behind three crosses here to dedicate the place i would not permit anybody to us or stood at the door to see that nobody talked when you're done you're talking outside you come in if you desire too silently you come to the altar and pray silently you walk back to your seat open up the bible what your neighbor done that was up to him you had nothing to say if you wanted to talk to him say i'll see him outside i'm in here to worship the lord you read his word or sat quietly and then the music sister gertie i don't know whether she's here this morning or not sister gibbs the old piano i believe set back in this corner and the best of my remembrance and she would play softly down at the cross where my savior died some real sweet soft music and then until it come time for the service and the song leader got up and led a couple of congregational songs and then if they had some outstanding solo they sang it but never just a bunch of carrying on and when the music continually played and went and then when i heard that i knowed it was time to come out and when a minister walks into a congregation of people praying in the anointing of the spirit you're bound to hear from heaven that's just all there's no way to keep from it but if you walk into confusion then you're so confused the spirit's grieved brother branham it looked like he was so strict i wouldn't allow any talking i should stood at the doors to see to it nobody talked come in pray the order you want go to your seat read your bible pray when your neighbor did don't talk i wouldn't allow this i wouldn't allow that and gertie sister gertie or sister gibbs would play quietly and then the song leader would sing a few songs maybe a solo but not a bunch of carrying on and then and then when it began to play i knew it was time to come and i would come brother brennaman looks like he's so strict but what's he driving to what's the whole point of it all why are the rules in the first place why the order to begin with because when a minister walks into a group of people and that atmosphere anointed by the spirit you're bound to hear from god it was all about the increasing of the word so that the word would increase it's not about rule keeping amen this isn't a denomination it's not an order it's not a structure amen we're not here to get a merit badge for church order we've got a church order right no we're here to get focused on this one thing the one thing that matters most the one thing that will change our lives to keep us going that'll keep us fed that'll keep us strength in the spirit the very thing that we need more than anything else is the word amen we need the word and we need god to preach it in the spirit to give us revelation of the word and that's the one that has preeminence among us it's all about the one sitting on the throne [Music] brother bannon says in 1957 and may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word and for a text tonight if i should be called that and no matter any kind of service the word should have preeminence it should be first brother brennan is not saying that you have to do the preaching first he's saying the word should have first place and god hiding himself in simplicity again he says father we now dedicate ourselves to the service to the word brother branham was never setting up church to have church now we now dedicate ourselves to the service to the word with all that's in us lord the congregation and the people they dedicate themselves this morning to the hearing of the word and as we ministers dedicate ourselves to the preaching of the word so what was the dedication the congregation is dedicated to hearing the word and the people are dedicated the ministry is dedicated to preaching the word so what's everybody dedicated for what's the building dedicated for what are the people dedicated for what's the ministry dedicated for it's all dedicated for the word this place is dedicated for the word amen the mystery is dedicated supposed to be dedicated for the word and the people are supposed to be dedicated to hear the word it's all about the word having preeminence that's the whole point branham comes to the seventh seal and in the seventh seal he says now notice in revelation 7 we read this 12 000 of each tribe of the selected out of all there's 12 000 out of each tribe that's elected and are set right here in order oh my what are they they're in tribal order yet they're not now but they will be so brother of them is in the seventh seal and he's preaching back on the seventh chapter of revelation and he's showing that there's 144 000 elect jews that are going to be called in the end time during the tribulation period and when they're called he said they're not in order they don't know their tribal order they don't know what tribe they're from he said but they're going to be put back in order you think god doesn't care about order it's everywhere it's in the entire bible this is why our homes have to be in order when we get out of order and mom takes dominion and dad becomes submissive amen that thing can't be blessed by god because it's out of god's order it doesn't reflect god so when we get our families out of order the children in rebellion and no respect for mom and dad and chaos in our homes that thing is not right that's not the order god's looking for we're not just talking about church order we're talking about order and the word brings order the word puts that in its place the word puts mom in her place the word puts the kids in their place so that everybody's in their position and the family is moving in harmony and unity there's a cooperation of effort and it's all for the same thing to glorify and magnify god to minister the word and to have a home where the holy ghost is welcome to rest his feet because we have to have a home where it's not the nature of the wolf where i'm biting you and you're biting me and we expect the holy ghost to come and rest in that home but it's got to be a home where the nature of the lamb is the nature that the home keeps getting brought under and when the wolf nature pops up we take care of it amen so we bring the nature of the home back into the lamb nature submissive to the word and cooperation with one another all working in harmony for one purpose where the holy ghost is welcome to rest his feet so you see why i'm not preaching about church order it's order the word brings order the devil brings a perversion of the word to bring disorder the the devil's trying to break order god's word is bringing order praise be to god and so now the 144 thousand why couldn't he just call 144 000 and say you're it they had to be put back in order because god cares about order yet they are not now but they will be they're in tribal order what will be in the tribal order not the regular jew what's going to be in tribal order not all the jews the elect are going to be put back in order not the regular jew but the ones that's the elected the 144 000 will be set in tribal order oh my how i would like to show you we won't get into it but that's exactly what the church has to be right in order he didn't elaborate on it he didn't preach anymore on it he said oh how i wish i had time we won't go into it but what happens to the 144 000 elect is exactly what has to happen to the elect bride in the end time she has to be put back in order amen the the the altar has to be put back in place the seven stones have to be put back in order this church has to come back into god's order amen so that the presence of god can fill the temple and the message the paradox brother bam says i've often wanted to come into a church i've longed to see it this is amazing when brother brown says i've longed to see this i guess where i could walk in the back door front door wherever it was look across an audience and see a perfect church all in order sin couldn't stay there no the spirit would call it out you see it just couldn't stay like ananias and fire you just couldn't do it there'd be no sin in that that group no sir see the spirit quickly speak it like that no matter what it was how little it would be done see women men sitting there under the power of the holy spirit the spirit of god moving perfectly moving this someone had done something wrong in the congregation couldn't they couldn't they come quickly and confess it before the spirit got a hold of it to confess it before they come to tell it because they know right then it's going to be called that's right that's the church of the living god how many old poor old how my old poor old heart now is getting old how i've longed to stand and see a church like that i may yet i hope to perfect works of god without sin now that could understand brother branham was looking for a church that had perfectly come to order i don't think he was looking for a church that had such a strict pastor and harsh deacons that they got everything just right because you could with a harsh pastor and strict and deacons you could ever get everybody in their sunday best sitting in the sea all in rows paying attention not whispering and not talking but inside that's right because the the pastor and the deacon use the wolf nature to get the people inside and all they're going to bring out is a wolf nature out of the people but it takes a shepherd's nature to get a sheep in position it's a different nature it takes the nature of the shepherd who's gentle who leads who who cooperates with the sheep it takes a shepherd's nature and brother branham is looking for a church that's all in order not rigid by rules not stiff and harsh amen not forcing but where there's a harmony a unity where everybody brings themselves in order and the spirit of god keeps them in order because we have the same focus the same purpose the same attitude the same desire god help us to understand god's order i want god's order in my private life i want it in my home i want it in the church i attend i want it in the bride globally i want god's order because i'm looking to put the word in preeminence i'm looking for his presence to remain with us that's the whole desire of our heart and that's the whole purpose of god's order every time god had order he dwelt there when god had order and eden he could come down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with his children when god had order in the camp of israel he could dwell in that tabernacle and they could see it by a pillar of fire and a cloud when they had order amen in solomon's kingdom and he brought the temple the order god could dwell right there amen when god had order in the first church he could dwell right amongst him i want to come to god's order because i want to be the place where he can dwell i want to be the place where his feet can rest i like to finish with this quote out of the rapture so then i heard something like on when christian soldiers i looked and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down on their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the gospel she was the word they looked like one out of every nation i was looking at it as they passed by and i seen them pass by instead of going down they started going up and i noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of line i screamed stay in line and the vision left me and i was standing in the room screaming stay in line stay in line what was the desire of the prophet amen he wanted to present amen a virgin bride to christ and see the union of the of the bride of christ in christ she had to be in order everything had to be in order amen when when when it came time for esther to present herself to the king everything had to be in order the way haggai had ordered it and it was an order it was breathtaking when it was an order it caught the attention of the king see god's given his word for a reason he sent a prophet this day with a reason for the purpose for a reason and if we'll just yield to that and submit to that god has offices for a reason god has an order a structure everything to be decently in order and all for a reason and it all focuses to one thing and our order in our life and our order and our homes and our order in our church and all comes to one thing is to give preeminence to the one who's sitting on the throne when you give preeminence to the word you're giving preeminence to him and we're here to give preeminence to him eden was ordered the church in the wilderness was ordered the new testament church was ordered and this restored bride has been put back in order and the prophet in the vision was crying the last thing he saw was her getting kind of out of step and he come to out of the vision screaming get back instead she was getting out of step with the word she had got her eyes off of the prophet on the inspection stand she started looking around at other churches and other things she got her focus in the wrong spot amen and he was screaming get back in line he was trying to get her focus back on him get back in step and i want to say as a church i want to be in step i want to be in line god help me to get back in line and to stay in line help me to stay in my position to do what you've called me to do help me to come with one heart with one mind with one accord and cooperation amen so that you can break the bread so that we can all leave here filled and there's more left over i i want to come i want to set the atmosphere right we're where we're driving to church getting ready to give preeminence to the word coming with the right approach amen we do all our visiting afterwards because we're here it's all about the increase of the word right now i'm hungry i need something from wednesday amen i ate wednesday but i'm coming sunday i'm coming wednesday from sunday i'm coming because i want him to break the bread there's something i have need of today so i'm coming focused amen i'm not visiting everybody out until i hear the first chords of the song strike and the song leader standing there and i come rushing in i need the word more than that i need his presence more and then a half-hearted effort i need his presence i we need him among him more than a lazy approach a last-minute approach amen a haphazard approach i need him more amen than be talking about wrong things in the car and then come in here and try to get in the right atmosphere i need him more than that i want his presence i long for his presence more than that kind of effort is that fair i want to come prepared i want to spend my time preparing i want to have fellowship i want to visit i want to shake my brother's hand but i'm going to do that after the breaking of bread because i want to come and i want to get in my place in my company of 50. and i don't want anybody to waste any time getting me in position i want to be there i want to eat now i don't want a bunch of carrying on i don't want to need a bunch of talking i don't i don't need all this other stuff we're just going to sing get the atmosphere right i mean get the channel opened up amen and call for the minister to come minister is going to come because i want him to break that bread i'm here with need i need some bread and i want to eat til i'm full and i want to hear the minister said i didn't get to half my notes i want to know there's basketfuls left over i want to see his presence i want to recognize he's among us in the breaking of bread but i've got to do my part in a cooperation the disciples have to work with the people the people have to work with the disciples but he will give the increase and at the end of it all we can leave filled to where we can hold no more but know that that disciples got a basket full we haven't even touched yet i believe every bit of that is absolutely possible i believe it's possible for every service i believe it's possible for every gathering if we come with the right approach if we get the order right and we recognize who's on the throne and oh it's all about him my quietness my preparation my meditation my prayer it's all about giving preeminence to the word our song service or even the special that would be sung everything is about giving preeminence to the word if we all stay focused on that then i don't think he'll ever fail with whatever little bit that we have however little fish i don't care however little tiny the fish is or what little tiny biscuit we got if we all come with the right approach i believe god will take the simplest of thought that he put in a preacher's heart two little biscuits five little fish he may have two scriptures and five quotes and i believe in before our eyes he'll break and break and break and break and break and the preacher will say i'm just going to stop there can't go no further we're all so full we're about to pop i hope that you have a better understanding of church order it's not legalism friends throw the legalistic id out the window if one of our brothers would encourage you now we might want to go in he's not upset with you he's not punishing you he's got this focus in his mind and there are times that we get out of focus that we lose track of time that we forget where we're at that we get things out of order every one of us have done it and we'll do it again and if a brother just comes and stands next to you and you know why he's standing there just say god bless your brother and get into the sanctuary because we all got to cooperate for the same thing we're all here pulling for the same thing because i believe god will do exactly what the prophet said he will do i believe he'll do exactly what he's always done when his people get in order give him the preeminence and i want to see him do it again and again and again and again praise god i hope you're full got a little bit left in my basket we'll save it for next time let's all stand musicians if you could come brother ben if you make your way up let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege lord of being here for being alive in this day for having this word like no other generation has ever had it lord god you've given us so much lord you've broke bread for us so many times we've eaten two are full we've eaten till we couldn't hold anymore we've gone and left and come back and you've had more you've never failed lord you've never failed to keep your word oh i pray god that you would help us to keep our part help us lord to be faithful help us to be true help us to honor your word help us to cooperate with one another let the shepherds accomplish the sheep and the sheep of the shepherds the disciples with the people the people with the disciples may every gift supply may every joint supply may every office supply for one thing that's so that you can be the king among us that your word takes its rightful place and your presence is welcome among us god show us how to do that where we're wrong correct us where we need to change change us lord but make us all focused on this one self same goal then we might watch you break bread and multiply again and again and again we love you for your faithfulness we love you for the word that you've given us and god help us to remain faithful to you in jesus christ's name we pray bless us lord as we go to have a service with levi and his family whatever visitors will have god we don't know who will be there and we don't know the condition and we don't know the need but you do and nor just as you broke the bread here this morning i pray that you break the bread there for them to eat that there might be an abundance because i don't believe you ever get tired of breaking the loaves and the fishes god i don't think we could ever out tap your resources i don't think we could ever eat more than you can supply so i pray lord that you would supply for them as well let us go from here with full hearts lord in gratitude and thanksgiving we love you father and we ask your blessings in jesus christ's name
