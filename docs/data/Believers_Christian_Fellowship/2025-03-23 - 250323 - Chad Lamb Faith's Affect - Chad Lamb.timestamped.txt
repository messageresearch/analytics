[12:06] given us of gathering together again for
[12:09] we know Lord this is a tremendous
[12:11] privilege you've granted to us and we
[12:12] feel privileged to be here and God we
[12:16] want to remember our brothers who are
[12:17] away the gifts that you placed in them
[12:19] that you intend to use in other
[12:20] assemblies and other places I pray that
[12:23] you inspire them and anoint them and use
[12:25] them mightly Lord and may your word go
[12:27] forth true and clear here may it have an
[12:30] effect in the lives of those who hear it
[12:33] God we're asking the same thing here
[12:34] this morning that you would take this
[12:36] vessel under your control and God that
[12:39] you could take Dominion Lord over each
[12:41] of us Lord and may your word find place
[12:44] in us and may it grow Lord and bear
[12:47] fruit and bring back a manifestation a
[12:49] harvest unto you Lord we're asking that
[12:52] you would take preeminence among us and
[12:53] that you would have your way we love you
[12:56] we thank you for this privilege and we
[12:58] yield ourselves now to you in Jesus
[13:00] Christ's name we pray
[13:03] amen amen God bless you while we're
[13:05] standing let's take our Bibles and turn
[13:08] to the Book of
[13:09] Luke amen I just want to say
[13:12] congratulations to brother Mike and
[13:13] sister Carolyn sprunger that was a major
[13:16] Milestone may God bless you in your
[13:19] anniversary also want to greet our
[13:21] visitors we glad to have my mom again
[13:23] you know her sister Debbie but she's mom
[13:25] to me and so we're glad she made it up
[13:28] and it's always a pleasure and some of
[13:30] the Ritter family are here so God bless
[13:31] you it's good to see you guys as well
[13:35] amen and everybody else visiting God
[13:36] bless you I see you have some visitors
[13:38] but may the Lord bless you and we want
[13:40] you to feel very welcome here amongst
[13:42] usen let's look at Luke
[13:48] 18 and
[13:51] verse
[13:56] 8 Luke 18 and 8
[14:00] I tell you that he will avenge them
[14:02] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[14:04] man cometh shall he find faith on the
[14:07] earth may may God bless you as you take
[14:09] your
[14:12] seats amen so we want to look at this
[14:17] subject of uh Faith once again we preach
[14:19] about all the time it's such a theme
[14:20] through the scriptures and uh but the
[14:23] question was nevertheless when the son
[14:26] of man cometh shall he find faith on the
[14:28] Earth
[14:29] so when the son of man cometh what is he
[14:31] looking for Faith amen and so I'd like
[14:35] to take for a title uh this morning
[14:37] Faith's effect Faith's effect because
[14:40] that Faith should have an effect and
[14:43] that effect should uh be move into a
[14:46] manifestation and so we'd like to talk
[14:48] about that subject and I'm just trying
[14:50] to get myself to relax because I got
[14:52] many many things that I want to share
[14:54] but we may not get to them all I
[14:55] understand that we'll be conscious of
[14:57] time and and usually when I say there's
[14:59] a I've got a lot of things I don't want
[15:01] the children's Hearts to fail for fear
[15:03] we won't we won't be here three or four
[15:05] hours and maybe not the children maybe
[15:07] everybody's but there is much you know
[15:10] I've been looking at this for a long
[15:11] time and we preach on these things all
[15:13] the time but they just keep coming uh
[15:15] into greater Clarity all the time things
[15:18] that meant so much to us before mean
[15:20] more to us all the time and God is
[15:23] really uh constantly growing us in our
[15:26] Revelation and growing us as his
[15:28] children in our manifestation everything
[15:30] we should be growing amen the one thing
[15:32] we do not want is to become stagnant and
[15:35] I say God help us when I feel that old
[15:38] lethargy creeping into me it scares me
[15:40] and I say God I don't want to be
[15:42] stagnant I want to grow I want to keep
[15:44] moving in this plan amen if we're still
[15:47] here and haven't take the body change
[15:48] there's more for us amen more to
[15:51] manifest uh uh more seed to find more
[15:53] word to display more to be revealed
[15:55] something there's more of something and
[15:57] I want it all I don't never want to get
[15:59] complacent or content and say well
[16:01] that's enough for me God Amen but if
[16:03] I've come to God's banquet if I've come
[16:05] to his his Feast if I've accepted the
[16:07] invitation and come to the spiritual
[16:09] Feast I want to taste everything he's
[16:12] got laid out in the buffet amen and so
[16:15] God's been so good to us and so faithful
[16:17] to us amen and he's kept his promises to
[16:20] us and but I never want that God's
[16:23] faithfulness to cause
[16:25] complacency because all is well and
[16:27] things are under control oh and I don't
[16:29] I don't ever want that and I said God
[16:31] help us to constantly fight against that
[16:33] and keep pressing forward you know the
[16:35] first chch AG failed because they
[16:37] stopped pressing forward in the spirit
[16:39] amen and we don't want to follow that
[16:41] pattern that pattern's been broke amen
[16:43] for the church in the last days that we
[16:45] won't go back through the denominational
[16:47] Cycles amen but we'll break free from
[16:49] what tripped us up before and keep
[16:51] pressing towards the mark of the high
[16:53] calling in Christ Jesus
[16:56] amen so when the son of man cometh shall
[16:59] he find faith on the earth that's the
[17:02] question Amen in uh in the message
[17:05] brother B says God will continually has
[17:08] been separating separating and that's
[17:11] what he's doing tonight that's what he
[17:13] always does you can see it in every
[17:16] meeting he is separating Faith from
[17:18] unbelief he speaks out he declares
[17:21] himself to those who will believe him
[17:22] and have faith in him in another quote
[17:25] brother B said God is always separating
[17:26] he's separating Faith from unbelief he's
[17:29] separating light from darkness and how
[17:30] does he do it he always does it by his
[17:33] word amen because God will bring his
[17:35] word amen and those who believe the word
[17:38] will move to the word and that
[17:40] automatically cause separation from
[17:41] light and darkness it brings us out of
[17:43] Darkness into light amen
[17:46] amen but then there's always those who
[17:48] don't believe and they remain in the
[17:50] condition but his word brings a
[17:52] separation and that's how he separates
[17:54] by his word and as you know we just uh
[17:57] finished a book for our our tape service
[17:59] we went through uh is your life worthy
[18:02] of the gospel and as we were going
[18:03] through there amen it so many things
[18:06] just were speaking to me and that's what
[18:08] was really affecting this this message
[18:10] this morning so just hold in your mind
[18:13] everything we discussed and remembered
[18:14] and is your life worthy of the gospel
[18:16] because I I'm drawing from that quite a
[18:18] bit amen and whenever we do a tape
[18:20] service I go through that book in that
[18:23] tape probably five times by the time
[18:25] we're done and so for for me you know I
[18:27] go through it just to see if that's one
[18:29] that we want to do so I listen to it and
[18:31] I read it then after we go through it I
[18:34] I go through it again and make my notes
[18:35] then I go through it again the day that
[18:38] we play it and then I go through it
[18:39] again with all of you here and I say
[18:42] praise God that's a privilege that I
[18:43] have but as we go through it then all of
[18:46] a sudden it just goes deeper and deeper
[18:47] and deeper into our hearts that what we
[18:50] learned when we went through that tape
[18:51] is what makes your life worthy of the
[18:53] Gospel amen and it's not the works that
[18:55] you can do it's not how how well you can
[18:57] perform the things that God have said
[18:59] but what makes our life worthy of the
[19:01] Gospel is that we actually heard the
[19:03] invitation and when we heard the
[19:04] invitation to the spiritual Feast we
[19:07] came amen amen because who was not
[19:10] worthy when when he was speaking there
[19:12] in Matthew 22 he says those who were
[19:14] bidden didn't come were not they're not
[19:17] worthy to eat of my supper what made
[19:19] them not worthy is because when the
[19:20] servant called they didn't come so then
[19:24] he goes out and he says go to the
[19:25] highways and byways and go to the lame
[19:27] and the Halt and the blind The Afflicted
[19:29] and and and bring them in and when they
[19:31] brought them in the servant came to him
[19:33] and said there's more room and he said
[19:35] go Amen to the highways into the hedges
[19:37] and and find compel them to come in both
[19:41] the Bad and the
[19:43] good that's probably my favorite
[19:45] scripture in that whole thing the Bad
[19:47] and the good he wasn't looking for good
[19:50] people that he could invite he was
[19:52] looking for whoever would come to the
[19:55] invitation some of those who came were
[19:57] bad people
[20:00] same thing in the scriptures those who
[20:01] came to Christ some of them were bad
[20:03] people they would have been labeled as
[20:05] bad harlots and prostitutes and tax
[20:07] collectors and things like that they
[20:08] were bad but they came the good people
[20:11] who would have been considered good the
[20:13] Pharisees and the Sadducees and the
[20:14] religious and those who never missed a
[20:16] church service and did everything right
[20:18] amen they didn't come proving they were
[20:21] unworthy and the bad were
[20:24] worthy amen so God was looking for faith
[20:29] somebody that would believe his word
[20:30] amen so let's turn together to the Book
[20:33] of John and let's look at John chapter
[20:35] 6 so that's just a brief synopsis of is
[20:39] your life worthy of the Gospel but when
[20:42] brother Venom ends he doesn't leave it
[20:44] just there because he starts to show
[20:47] amen that that kind of faith that
[20:49] genuine faith in the present tense word
[20:52] of God it actually will produce a life
[20:55] of that word so you can't just leave it
[20:58] with I believe the word for my hour for
[21:00] my day but that accepting that that that
[21:03] feasting at the at the Lord's uh uh
[21:06] Feast at the spiritual Feast will
[21:08] actually bring a manifestation of the
[21:11] very thing we're feeding on Amen and
[21:14] that's how he ends that message and
[21:15] starts showing it so it's not just
[21:17] one-sided and we can't just say well I
[21:20] believe the message of the hour I'm
[21:22] secure but but because that's what the
[21:25] Pharisees tried to do they tried to say
[21:27] I believe Moses I believe Moses and we
[21:29] keep all the law and we're fine but when
[21:31] God came to them in the form of Flesh in
[21:34] Jesus Christ they rejected that
[21:36] manifestation of the word showing that
[21:38] all their good deeds and all their good
[21:39] works amounted to
[21:41] nothing amen because they didn't
[21:46] believe a amen so now we're going to go
[21:48] to John chapter 6 I'm going to pick it
[21:50] up in verse
[21:51] 47 and once again very these things are
[21:54] very
[21:56] familiar in verse 47 he says verily
[21:59] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[22:02] on me hath everlasting life amen praise
[22:05] be to God Amen not will have amen
[22:09] already has that's the evidence what and
[22:13] we're going to get into this here and
[22:15] and brother clear on this the true
[22:17] evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able
[22:19] to receive the word for your day and
[22:21] this is what Jesus says anden he says
[22:23] right here I say unto you he that
[22:25] believeth on me what was he he was the
[22:28] the word made flesh for that day and
[22:30] hour he was the promise being fulfilled
[22:33] in front of them amen and he that
[22:35] believeth uh uh I'm sorry let me read
[22:38] this again I say unto you he that
[22:40] believeth on me hath everlasting life
[22:43] amen said I am that bread of life your
[22:47] fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness
[22:49] and are dead this is the bread which
[22:51] cometh down from heaven that a man may
[22:53] eat thereof and not die I am the living
[22:56] bread which came down from heaven If any
[22:59] man eat of this bread he shall live
[23:00] forever and the bread that I will give
[23:02] is my flesh which I will give for the
[23:05] life of the world and the Jews therefore
[23:07] strove among themselves saying how can
[23:09] this man give us his flesh to eat then
[23:12] Jesus said unto them verily verily I say
[23:14] unto you except you eat the Flesh of the
[23:16] son of man and drink his blood you have
[23:19] no life in you who so eateth my flesh
[23:22] and drinketh my blood hath eternal life
[23:24] and I will raise him up at the last day
[23:26] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[23:29] is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh
[23:31] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[23:34] die in him as the living father hath
[23:37] sent me and I live by the father so he
[23:39] that eateth me even he shall live by me
[23:42] this is that bread which came down from
[23:45] heaven not as your fathers did eat mana
[23:47] and are dead he that eateth of this
[23:49] bread shall live forever these things
[23:52] said he in the synagogue as he taught in
[23:54] capernium many therefore of his
[23:56] disciples when they heard this said this
[23:58] is a hard saying who can hear it so now
[24:02] Jesus comes and he begins to say at the
[24:05] beginning of of this what we read uh he
[24:08] that believeth on me hath everlasting
[24:10] life then he starts to tell them what he
[24:13] is who he is amen he starts to describe
[24:16] himself to them I am the bread that came
[24:18] down out of
[24:20] heaven and he says he that believeth on
[24:22] me hath everlasting life so what is
[24:25] brother what is Jesus doing here I say
[24:28] it this way he's challenging
[24:31] Faith because he says he that believeth
[24:34] on me hath everlasting life then he
[24:37] starts to describe what he really is and
[24:40] now he says I'm the Mana I'm the true
[24:42] Mana I'm the bread of life I'm the bread
[24:45] that came down from heaven and whoever
[24:47] eats me will have eternal life and all
[24:50] of a sudden these people sitting here
[24:52] amen they came to hear Jesus amen they
[24:54] were Disciples of his this was brother
[24:56] man says part of the 70 that went from
[24:58] City to City preaching the kingdom was
[25:00] coming doing Miracles and signs they
[25:02] were here the 12 disciples were here
[25:04] other disciples were there they were
[25:06] gathered because they were believing in
[25:08] Jesus they believed in his ministry they
[25:10] were supporting the work they were
[25:11] preaching it amen and now he begins to
[25:14] he begins to say things like my flesh is
[25:17] meat indeed my body amen you have to eat
[25:20] me and my blood is drink you have to
[25:23] drink my
[25:25] blood and and and brother bam says he
[25:28] doesn't explain it amen because it's the
[25:32] point wasn't to explain it cuz he's not
[25:34] trying to educate them into Faith he's
[25:36] looking for
[25:42] Faith praise
[25:44] God when the son of man cometh will he
[25:47] find faith not a program that educates
[25:50] everybody to have the right answers
[25:52] right it's not about getting the right
[25:53] answers and I say it all the time it's
[25:55] not about getting a perfect score on the
[25:57] test
[25:59] amen so then he he he says all these
[26:02] things and he makes it so difficult and
[26:06] and in some ways you look at this
[26:08] through your human mind and you say this
[26:09] is so unfair how could they know how
[26:12] could they understand how could they
[26:14] comprehend they never heard anything
[26:15] like this before amen and and it wasn't
[26:18] unfair because those that had a seed an
[26:21] eternal seed Gene of God on the inside
[26:24] they didn't have to understand to say I
[26:26] don't understand but you're you're the
[26:28] you're still the one for me I still
[26:31] believe in you okay you say You're The
[26:33] Bread of Heaven you say I have to eat
[26:34] your flesh you say I have to drink your
[26:36] blood I don't know what you mean I don't
[26:38] know how I'm going to do this I don't it
[26:40] doesn't make sense to me and I'm a
[26:41] little worried about what you just said
[26:43] but there's something inside of me says
[26:45] I still believe in
[26:47] you this is what they said here in verse
[26:51] 61 when when Jesus knew in himself that
[26:54] his disciples murmured at it he said
[26:56] unto them does this offend
[26:59] you what and if you shall see the son of
[27:02] man Ascend up where he was before it is
[27:04] the spirit that quickeneth the Flesh
[27:06] propit of nothing the words that I speak
[27:08] unto you they are spirit and they are
[27:10] life but there are some of you that
[27:12] believe
[27:14] not Jesus knew some didn't
[27:16] believe so what was he doing he was
[27:19] testing
[27:21] faith for Jesus knew from the beginning
[27:24] who they were that believe not and who
[27:26] should betray him and he said therefore
[27:28] said I unto you that no man can come
[27:31] unto me except it were given unto him of
[27:33] my father amen from that time many of
[27:36] his disciples went back and walked no
[27:38] more with him then said Jesus unto the
[27:41] twel will you also go
[27:43] away you think about brother B does such
[27:46] a good job dramatizing this he says you
[27:49] know the crowds start to disperse the
[27:51] the the healing campaign and revivals
[27:53] are fading away people start leaving him
[27:55] he starts saying things that are so OD
[27:58] and so contrary to understanding and he
[28:00] starts and what's he doing brother B
[28:03] said he's thinning out his
[28:04] crowd amen because what does he want
[28:07] does he want a crowd no he wants seed he
[28:10] come to find his lost sheep his lost
[28:12] sheep are the children of God the
[28:13] children of God have a predestinated
[28:15] seed there's something in them to
[28:17] believe with what's he looking for he's
[28:20] he says I came not to save the world but
[28:22] to save mine that are in the world and
[28:23] what's he looking for his that are in
[28:25] the world and how will he locate them
[28:28] you're the ones that can
[28:30] believe right now all this crowd was
[28:33] gathered around Jesus and they all would
[28:35] have said we believe in Jesus we believe
[28:39] he's a mighty man of God we believe he
[28:41] does great Miracles we believe he's a
[28:43] prophet of God we believe all of these
[28:45] things but when he started to put the
[28:47] faith test yeah amen they started
[28:51] walking
[28:52] away and brother Bram said it was so
[28:55] discouraging to the disciples because
[28:57] they like the campaign they they liked
[28:59] the big movements and revivals and they
[29:02] started fading away and they started
[29:04] walking away and and everybody's leaving
[29:07] and that's not what the disciples wanted
[29:10] they wanted a restoration of the Kingdom
[29:12] they wanted to kick the Romans out they
[29:13] wanted to establish him as king this was
[29:15] so contrary to their thinking it was
[29:17] going the opposite of what they thought
[29:19] was going to happen in that day and what
[29:21] they thought about the scriptures now
[29:23] everything's backwards amen and so they
[29:27] walk no more with
[29:29] them then said Jesus unto the 12 will
[29:31] you also go away then Simon Peter
[29:33] answered him Lord to whom shall we
[29:36] go thou H has the words of eternal life
[29:40] and we believe and are ass that thou art
[29:43] that Christ the son of the Living God
[29:46] Amen Jesus answered them have not I
[29:49] chosen you 12 and one of you is a
[29:51] devil and he spake of Judas es scariot
[29:54] the son of Simon for it was for he it
[29:57] was was that should betray him being one
[29:59] of the
[30:02] 12
[30:04] Jesus I'll just say it this way Jesus
[30:08] didn't try to preserve his
[30:11] crowd or his
[30:14] reputation he wasn't interested in
[30:16] looking good or being popular he came
[30:18] for one purpose and that was due to the
[30:20] father's will and he came to seek and
[30:22] save that which was lost amen and he
[30:25] knew he could do it by the word
[30:29] the disciples brother mam said the
[30:31] disciples didn't have any better
[30:32] understanding than the ones who walked
[30:35] away they didn't have a clue either what
[30:39] eat my flesh and drink my blood meant
[30:42] but they they knew one thing we believe
[30:45] and are sure that thou art the Christ
[30:47] the son of the Living God they had faith
[30:51] in him regardless of what he said was
[30:53] confusing regardless of the things they
[30:55] saw around them were confusing
[30:57] regardless of everything went contrary
[30:59] to what they thought the Bible said what
[31:01] they thought was going to happen in
[31:02] their day when it went completely
[31:04] backwards they still believed in him
[31:08] because of the believe in him ha eternal
[31:12] life praise God brother Benham says in
[31:15] the unveiling of God may the Lord add
[31:17] his Blessing to the reading of his word
[31:19] now my subject this morning I trust that
[31:21] God will reveal this and each time if
[31:23] you who take the tapes and listen and I
[31:25] hope and trust that you've had a
[31:26] spiritual understanding of what that God
[31:29] has been trying to get over to the
[31:30] church without saying it right out see
[31:33] it's a thing sometimes we have to say
[31:35] things in such a way that it might thin
[31:37] down it might bring some to go out some
[31:40] to leave and some to ponder over but
[31:43] that's done purposely it must be done
[31:45] that
[31:46] way then it might be that someone would
[31:49] say you mean God would purposely do a
[31:51] thing like that he certainly did he does
[31:53] yet and he said one day when he had
[31:56] thousands around him he said except you
[31:57] eat of the Flesh of the son of man uh
[32:00] Son of God or son of man and drink his
[32:02] blood you have no life in you so brother
[32:04] R teaches us this principle and brother
[32:07] bandham is is showing us that even in
[32:09] the message that he's bringing he's
[32:10] saying things and and he says I hope
[32:13] you're catching I hope you have a
[32:15] spiritual understanding of what God has
[32:17] been trying to get over to the church
[32:19] without saying it outright and he says
[32:21] sometimes things have to be said in such
[32:23] a way amen that it might thin down so
[32:27] now brother Venom also is not trying to
[32:29] preserve a
[32:31] crowd I mean he tells us in spoken word
[32:33] is the original seed that the revivals
[32:35] are dying amen amen they're dying
[32:37] they're fading away and he said my
[32:39] Ministry is the worst of them all amen
[32:41] Billy Grahams is fading Oral Roberts is
[32:43] fading he said but there's been a seed
[32:45] planted and now see what Harvest comes
[32:47] forth from that seed and now when he
[32:49] comes to amen when he comes to priest
[32:51] the seals he says now that will cause
[32:53] 10,000 of my friends to leave me they're
[32:55] going to think I'm saying that about
[32:56] myself I'm trying trying to make myself
[32:58] a prophet or
[33:00] something amen but he couldn't smooth it
[33:04] over he couldn't always explain it all
[33:06] amen he had to do it was the ministry of
[33:08] Jesus Christ once again coming maybe
[33:11] with hard sayings or confusing things or
[33:13] something that it may he may not come
[33:15] right out and say it he may not make it
[33:17] so easy amen you may have to have a
[33:19] spiritual understanding to see what God
[33:21] is saying it may be easy to
[33:23] misunderstand what he's saying or get
[33:25] the wrong conclusion about what he's
[33:26] saying amen
[33:28] but God does that
[33:32] purposely listen that's not just about
[33:34] the message friends that's about our
[33:36] lives too amen there's things that
[33:38] happen to us and all around us we may
[33:40] not understand it may be contrary to the
[33:42] way we thought serving God was going to
[33:44] be or if I give everything to God Amen
[33:46] what it'll be like God will shower a me
[33:48] rewards upon me and all of the sudden we
[33:50] give our all to God and life goes into
[33:52] absolute chaos and we spiral out of
[33:55] control and we think this can't be right
[33:57] everything must be wrong amen and God
[33:59] doesn't explain it all to us why because
[34:01] he's trying to prove that Faith that's
[34:03] down
[34:05] inside things go confusing and God
[34:08] doesn't always explain everything right
[34:11] away right because he's looking for
[34:21] faith brother brandom tells us in
[34:23] anointed ones at the end time they he
[34:26] says they're preaching a historical
[34:30] Christ and that's what they're believing
[34:33] is a historical Christ so but the Bible
[34:36] said he is the I
[34:38] am not I was or will be I am right now
[34:42] that's the present tense truth that's
[34:44] what's always stumbled the unbeliever
[34:47] and that's what's always captivated the
[34:49] believer amen and the believer may not
[34:52] even understand or comprehend what it is
[34:55] that they believe and what it is that
[34:57] they're is drawing them amen but the
[34:59] present tense the I am God is the God
[35:02] Amen that the seed is always attracted
[35:06] to amen he said they're teaching a
[35:11] historical
[35:12] God just like they're trying to live in
[35:14] the past well Wesley said so and so or
[35:16] so and so said so and so you're refusing
[35:18] the promised word of the day the Mana
[35:21] that's clearly identified of the day and
[35:24] so we know the message of the hour is
[35:26] the word for our day
[35:30] amen and when the son of man cometh he's
[35:32] looking for what
[35:34] faith faith not a high intellectual
[35:39] understanding
[35:40] faith and if he's looking for faith
[35:43] above everything
[35:45] else then maybe he'll constantly change
[35:50] circumstances in our life that require
[35:53] Faith to be made
[35:55] manifest because if the question
[35:57] question is will I find faith if what
[35:59] he's looking for is faith if he's
[36:01] looking for his sheep who can believe
[36:03] his word then he's looking for he's
[36:05] looking for Faith so how do you find
[36:08] Faith amen the same way you find Faith
[36:10] all the way through the Bible all the
[36:12] way from the beginning to the end how
[36:14] did he find Faith he would bring a
[36:16] challenge amen there would be a
[36:18] challenge and in the challenge would be
[36:20] the word amen and there would be those
[36:22] who took the word and there would be
[36:23] those who refused the word and that's
[36:25] how he found faith in every regeneration
[36:28] in the
[36:29] Bible yeah that's how he found faith in
[36:31] Noah's day amen there was a challenge
[36:33] coming up because now there's a prophecy
[36:36] that God's going to destroy the world
[36:37] because of the sinfulness of man and God
[36:39] tells one man he doesn't tell the
[36:42] hierarchy of the world he doesn't come
[36:43] to counsels he tells one man who's his
[36:46] prophet and that man believes his word
[36:48] and the manifestation of him believing
[36:50] that word was he started building an
[36:53] ark and the Ark was the testimony that
[36:56] he believed God
[36:58] yeah amen and it also was the very thing
[37:01] that condemned the rest of the world
[37:03] because what condemned them was a man
[37:05] who would believe the word and not just
[37:07] give lip service to it or say I believe
[37:09] it but a man who actually believed it
[37:12] and that faith that he had in the word
[37:13] of God had an effect on him and the
[37:16] effect it had on him is he went to
[37:17] working on an
[37:19] ark
[37:22] amen let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 I
[37:25] just want to read this
[37:33] the Hebrews we'll go to Hebrews later
[37:34] again but I want to read verse
[37:37] 7 Hebrews 11:
[37:41] 7 by faith Noah being warned of God of
[37:44] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[37:47] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[37:49] house by which he condemned the world
[37:51] and became heir of the righteousness
[37:54] which is by
[37:55] Faith by faith
[37:58] how did he do it by
[38:00] faith amen by faith Noah being warned of
[38:04] God of things not seen as yet moved with
[38:07] fear why because he believed what God
[38:09] told him yeah he actually believed the
[38:12] prophecy he believed what God told him
[38:15] amen and he went into action preparing
[38:18] an ark his faith faith had an effect on
[38:24] him and he prepared an ark for the
[38:27] saving of his house by the wit by what
[38:31] by his faith in action he condemned the
[38:36] world why was the world condemned
[38:39] because there was a man on Earth who
[38:40] would believe the word and who would
[38:42] obey the word and who would act on it
[38:47] amen and that became the condemnation of
[38:50] the rest of the
[38:51] world Abel was a condemnation to Cain
[38:54] yeah because Abel believed the word and
[38:57] when he believed the word by Revelation
[38:59] he acted upon his faith it wasn't able
[39:01] just says oh it's a lamb I got the
[39:05] Revelation no that Revelation had to go
[39:07] into action he actually had to take a
[39:09] lamb and slay the lamb and when he
[39:11] slayed the lamb God and testimony and
[39:13] witnessed that his faith was correct
[39:15] when he saw the manifestation he
[39:17] accepted his offering and rejected
[39:19] Cain's Cain was condemned by what by the
[39:23] faith of Abel that was in action amen
[39:27] amen praise
[39:29] God
[39:32] so praise the
[39:34] Lord Brother bam I'm going to go into a
[39:37] couple quotes where brother bam talks
[39:38] about this Faith being the evidence and
[39:41] in Feast of trumpets he
[39:43] says he said an angel or the man said
[39:47] and he's talking about when Elohim comes
[39:49] and visits Abraham on the plains of
[39:51] mamory and he steps into flesh and he
[39:53] comes in flesh with two other angels and
[39:56] they come to Abraham and he says the
[39:58] angel or the man said why did Sarah say
[40:01] that in her heart in the tent behind him
[40:03] why did she say those things cannot be
[40:05] see a man in human flesh like a prophet
[40:08] yet it was Elohim Discerning the thought
[40:10] that was in Sarah's heart behind him and
[40:13] Jesus said as it was in the days of lot
[40:16] so will be at the coming of the end of
[40:17] the world when the son of man not Son of
[40:20] God when the son of man will be revealed
[40:23] so brother B's taking the scripture and
[40:25] pointing us right back to that incident
[40:26] with AB Abraham when God came in a body
[40:29] of Flesh and discerned the thoughts of
[40:31] Sarah in the tent behind him and he said
[40:33] God Jesus Christ promised that this will
[40:36] repeat again in the end
[40:40] time says hadn't had it through the age
[40:42] see that perfect continuation of the
[40:44] scripture here we live in it the
[40:46] Mysteries even of the baptism in the
[40:48] name of the Lord Jesus and away from the
[40:50] Oneness idea and these other things how
[40:52] the Holy Spirit has moved that in and
[40:54] showed it perfectly and the true baptism
[40:56] of the Holy Spirit the token and
[40:58] everything and he placed it and how he
[41:00] placed every reformer and everything
[41:02] just exactly and see right before our
[41:05] own eyes and it's not in a corner it's
[41:07] World known Jesus the son of God
[41:09] revealing himself by the scriptures
[41:11] making the scriptures that has been
[41:13] promised to this day like it was to that
[41:15] day and all other days live and to
[41:18] believe it is the evidence of the holy
[41:20] spirit amen to believe what that we've
[41:23] had a repeat in our day of what happens
[41:24] on the plains of memory amen that God
[41:27] God Elohim working in human flesh could
[41:29] discern the thoughts of Sarah and the
[41:31] tent behind him amen and and brother B
[41:33] says as it was in the days of lot as it
[41:35] was in the day days of Noah we're coming
[41:38] back to this time where this
[41:39] manifestation will come on Earth again
[41:41] and we've seen
[41:43] it and we believe
[41:46] it amen how many believe it amen amen
[41:52] worldwide when you take a senses
[41:54] worldwide how many believe that in the
[41:57] In the Flesh of William brandham was
[41:59] Elohim working the same sign and he
[42:01] worked to Abraham now he comes to
[42:03] Abraham's seed and he shows the same
[42:05] side because the son of man is coming
[42:07] looking for Faith amen worldwide take a
[42:10] senses how many believe it why is it so
[42:12] rejected worldwide why is it you believe
[42:18] it friends it's not an easy thing to
[42:23] believe unless you have a seat of God
[42:25] and then it's easy
[42:27] amen if you try to go down the
[42:29] intellectual route it's not an easy
[42:30] thing to believe that there's one man
[42:33] one man in all the world this man who
[42:35] came was born in Kentucky lived in
[42:37] obscurity didn't have a great education
[42:39] and you you're telling me that that one
[42:42] man that that was God in him and that
[42:43] sign of discernment was the Fulfillment
[42:46] of Luke 17:30 you're telling me in that
[42:48] man is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4
[42:50] you're telling me that this is this is
[42:52] you're you're trying to tell me that
[42:53] this is Revelations 1:7 in that man
[42:56] right there and we say
[42:59] amen amen intellectually how can you
[43:02] make it work intellectually amen it's
[43:04] not to mean it's not made to be worked
[43:07] intellectually CU When the son of man
[43:09] cometh what's he looking for
[43:12] Faith so he does it in a way that
[43:15] requires
[43:16] Faith
[43:19] amen again in Feast of the trumpets he
[43:21] says what is the true evidence Jesus
[43:23] said that you believe that I am he and
[43:26] he is the word
[43:28] that's the true evidence what is the
[43:29] true that you believe in me and he is
[43:31] the word amen why didn't they get it why
[43:35] didn't the Jews get it they were
[43:36] righteous men they were good men they
[43:38] were holy men and there were all kinds
[43:41] of people but to whom is predestinated
[43:43] to hear the word and how do you know
[43:46] whether it's the word each one says this
[43:48] it's the promise of the Bible being
[43:50] Vindicated of that age and there you are
[43:53] then you come back to where the holy
[43:55] spirit is amen it's the word made
[43:58] manifest for our day it has to be
[44:01] Vindicated and proved out which God
[44:03] thoroughly
[44:04] did again in is your life worthy of the
[44:07] Gospel he says the word is the truth
[44:09] right and the spirit of God will
[44:10] recognize his own
[44:12] writing he's identified by his writing
[44:15] it speaks of him and you're identified
[44:17] by believing it amen and it gives you
[44:20] your credentials of
[44:22] identification who wants credentials you
[44:25] want credentials you're a Believer you
[44:26] want credentials amen you're a child of
[44:28] God why when the word that God promised
[44:31] before comes into manifestation and is
[44:33] Vindicated by God and something in you
[44:36] says that's nothing but the truth amen
[44:38] that's the Vindication that's your
[44:41] credentials of
[44:43] identification but you say well I've
[44:45] never done this and I never saw a vision
[44:47] and I never did this Mighty thing that's
[44:49] not that's not verification of
[44:51] identification
[44:55] friends there's many many people in the
[44:57] world that have worked many miracles and
[44:59] not
[45:00] believed the message
[45:03] amen but what is your credentials of
[45:07] identification when you saw the
[45:09] manifestation of the word for your day
[45:10] you believed it amen amen don't
[45:13] complicate
[45:15] it keep it simple
[45:18] amen amen when brother bam says this
[45:22] he's he's in no way doing away with the
[45:25] fact that there also must be life that
[45:27] follows that because we've seen I think
[45:30] anybody who serve God any length of time
[45:32] you've seen people who make a confession
[45:34] of something they claim to believe
[45:36] something but none of their actions
[45:38] match the faith that they claim to
[45:41] have yeah see
[45:44] see talk is
[45:47] cheap talk is cheap anybody can say
[45:51] anything yeah and for whatever reason
[45:54] they can they can repeat what they've
[45:56] heard want to fit in or uh been raised a
[46:00] certain way and feel like this is but
[46:02] and don't even have a revelation of it
[46:03] everybody anybody can say anything amen
[46:05] but God has a way of cutting past the
[46:08] speech and getting to the reality so
[46:11] brother brandham is showing us what the
[46:12] true evidence of the Holy Ghost is and
[46:14] who a True Believer is but in no way
[46:16] even in is your life worthy of the
[46:18] Gospel what made them unworthy was not
[46:20] coming to the spiritual Feast what made
[46:21] them worthy as they came but then
[46:23] brother Brenham goes on to say but to
[46:25] receive the Life of Christ will manifest
[46:27] The Life of Christ that's a life worthy
[46:29] of the Gospel that that life will bear
[46:32] the fruits of the spirit that there will
[46:34] be there that faith will have an effect
[46:36] and that effect will be
[46:38] seen
[46:40] amen and even in saying that there's so
[46:43] many things that we preach and say that
[46:44] I feel like qualifying because if we go
[46:47] too far down any road am mean we get
[46:49] ourselves tripped up somewhere and so
[46:51] when we go down this road and we say
[46:52] there'll be a manifestation there'll be
[46:54] a life amen there will be the Life of
[46:55] Christ on display and then you go and
[46:57] you trip up and you fall down and you
[46:59] stumble and you say then the Satan will
[47:01] come and tell you see you didn't have it
[47:03] because if you really believed it you
[47:04] wouldn't have done
[47:07] XYZ has anybody ever been there besides
[47:10] me you can't possibly because you failed
[47:13] here and because you told a lie and
[47:15] because you did this and yeah right
[47:18] right but brother bam is so good we're
[47:20] so God is so good to us to give us a
[47:23] message and let us have the recordings
[47:24] and the tapes and the life brother bham
[47:26] told
[47:27] that that that the actual life of the
[47:30] Prophet becomes the
[47:32] word manifested so now what what is the
[47:35] word manifest inside our Prophet he's
[47:37] showing us when an adopted son of God
[47:39] part of the Bride when Christ gets
[47:41] control amen and dominion and a man what
[47:43] it begins to look like amen and does
[47:45] everybody believe that that he was under
[47:47] the control of Jesus Christ that he was
[47:49] manifesting the Life of Christ inside
[47:51] that man no man can do those Works
[47:53] brother Brandon would tell the crowd
[47:54] when he would begin Discerning and
[47:55] calling out he said says now you didn't
[47:57] touch me I'm just a man I'm just your
[47:59] brother you touched him your faith
[48:02] touched him where was him him was
[48:05] working through
[48:06] him and he says it's not me it's him
[48:09] that's working through this vessel
[48:11] that's who you're touching amen it's not
[48:13] the flesh but it's God in
[48:15] flesh and the prophet's life becomes the
[48:20] word made
[48:22] manifest but God so Faithfully shows us
[48:26] amen that though that Prophet had come
[48:28] to maturity though that Prophet was a
[48:30] tool in the hand of God though that
[48:32] Prophet was manifesting the end time
[48:34] signs the scriptures were alive in him
[48:36] he was the word made flesh amen that God
[48:39] was showing he still convinced his wife
[48:42] to lie to the
[48:44] lawyer and had to
[48:48] repent he still concocted a plan to
[48:50] where he could run away from his
[48:52] responsibilities and get away from the
[48:53] pain and go away and God had to stop him
[48:56] and correct
[48:58] that's right so praise God I can still
[49:02] be a Son of God Amen he told us you
[49:04] still have a sticky cck bur nature this
[49:06] old guy here has got to be made over
[49:08] again it's still amen fallen in
[49:10] corruption it's Redeemed by the Lord but
[49:11] we're pressing towards the fullness of
[49:13] adoption which the wi the change in the
[49:15] body and until then he says you'll
[49:17] always have a sticky cber nature that
[49:19] will that'll trip you up that'll bother
[49:21] you and so now I'm not I'm not going to
[49:24] let the devil take away my sunship every
[49:26] every time I fail because I got a sticky
[49:28] Cocker
[49:29] nature and neither am I going to take
[49:31] away the sunship of my brothers and
[49:33] sisters because they fail because not
[49:36] one of us would do that to the prophet
[49:37] of God Amen but if our brothers and
[49:40] sisters we heard them tell their wife
[49:42] tell the lawyer I'm not here I'll step
[49:44] outside and all of a sudden we'd be like
[49:46] he just
[49:47] lied he may not be a Son of
[49:53] God we've all seen each other do wrong
[49:56] things
[49:57] especially you live in a house with a
[49:59] few
[50:02] people but that's not going to take away
[50:05] my sunship and I'm not going to let that
[50:07] take away your sunship what we're
[50:08] looking at is those who have something
[50:10] inside of them that can believe the word
[50:12] for the hour and then they receive the
[50:14] life of that word and the life of that
[50:16] word is changing them from Glory unto
[50:18] Glory unto Glory we're growing into the
[50:21] fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ
[50:23] I'm not there yet but I'm certainly not
[50:25] what I used to be and if you see me
[50:27] stumble and fall then please help me
[50:30] brother and forgive me but I'm pressing
[50:32] towards the mark of the high calling in
[50:33] Christ Jesus because there's a life
[50:35] inside of me pushing me further down the
[50:38] roaden brother B said I backslide every
[50:41] day if he backslide every day then I
[50:43] must be up to like 10,000 per
[50:48] day even brother Perry Green in his
[50:51] testimony he tells us that brother bam
[50:52] looked at him and he said he made this
[50:54] statement brother Perry where God has me
[50:57] living now most of what you do would be
[50:59] sin for
[51:00] me but brother Brenham never made it sin
[51:03] for
[51:07] Perry he was not requiring Perry Green
[51:10] live the same life that God required
[51:12] brother brandham to live amen he was
[51:13] living the life God called him to live
[51:15] and he wasn't putting that requirement
[51:17] on somebody else right neither was he
[51:20] pushing Perry away like you're not a son
[51:22] of God but brother Brenham had the
[51:25] perspective God has grown me and
[51:27] revealed things to me and the Revelation
[51:29] the faith and the word should produce a
[51:31] life and if that Prophet had seen in the
[51:33] back part of God's mind and he had got
[51:35] Revelation upon Revelation and had
[51:37] talked to God and God had talked to him
[51:39] it should produce a life it should have
[51:42] an effect and his walk should be higher
[51:44] than his poor Brothers who's never heard
[51:46] the audible voice of God and met God in
[51:49] a cave yeah in the form of an
[51:53] Angel so don't believe the devil's Li
[51:56] eyes we're all going to make mistakes
[51:58] you're still going to make mistakes you
[52:00] be like well I've been serving God 40
[52:01] years I'm further down the road well
[52:03] just guess what you're going to make a
[52:04] mistake so just go ahead and plan on
[52:11] it but what God is looking for is
[52:15] Faith and that faith will have a
[52:20] manifestation it will have an effect on
[52:22] us and it will produce a
[52:25] life but but I don't know how we're
[52:27] going to come to Perfection until this
[52:29] body is made over
[52:31] again perfection in my soul yes maturity
[52:34] on the Inside Man absolutely but what am
[52:36] I going to do Paul says who can deliver
[52:38] me from this body of death oh Wretched
[52:40] Man that I am but I thank God through
[52:43] Jesus
[52:44] Christ with my flesh I serve sin but
[52:47] with My Soul with my mind I serve the
[52:52] truth thank
[52:55] God Amen
[52:58] amen praise
[53:00] God so what is your credentials of
[53:04] identification I haven't messed up in
[53:06] two
[53:11] weeks I've been at every service cuz
[53:13] brother bandam says be there every time
[53:16] the doors open well I believe that's
[53:18] true I believe we should be but that's
[53:21] not our identification that's not the
[53:23] credentials of identification
[53:26] amen the the the credentials of
[53:29] identification is I believe the present
[53:32] tense manifestation of Jesus Christ amen
[53:35] the word Made Alive in my day
[53:42] amen praise
[53:44] God let's look here at Hebrews at the
[53:46] beginning of chapter
[53:53] 11 the deacons have replaced our glass C
[53:56] cup with
[53:59] plastic I wonder
[54:06] why we're GNA have to invite brother
[54:08] Jason dears back it's a lot safer up
[54:09] here
[54:12] now amen we thank the deacons for
[54:16] looking after us keeping us safe amen
[54:19] Hebrews chapter
[54:22] 11 verse
[54:25] 4 by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[54:28] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[54:30] he obtained witness that he was
[54:32] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[54:34] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[54:38] amen you know Abel's gift testified of
[54:43] his
[54:45] faith he didn't just do something
[54:48] randomly he did it by
[54:50] faith and God honored his faith amen
[54:56] verse five by faith Enoch was translated
[54:58] that he should not see death it was not
[55:00] found because God had translated him for
[55:02] before his translation he had this
[55:05] testimony that he pleased
[55:07] God but without faith it is impossible
[55:10] to please
[55:12] him you know what that means to
[55:15] me that there's nothing that I can do in
[55:18] a Works program that will please him if
[55:20] it's done without faith amen amen that's
[55:24] right that doesn't mean I shouldn't and
[55:26] do good
[55:28] works I I'll say this way good works
[55:30] aren't evil they're good obedience is
[55:34] never wrong
[55:36] amen but without faith it doesn't do any
[55:39] good
[55:41] yeah because without faith it is imp
[55:43] impossible to please him for he that
[55:46] cometh to God must believe that he is
[55:49] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[55:51] diligently seek Him amen so what is God
[55:55] really looking for for Faith
[56:00] amen when I read this verse again
[56:03] yesterday it
[56:05] said uh by but without faith it's
[56:08] impossible to please him for he that
[56:10] cometh to God must believe that he is
[56:13] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[56:14] diligently seek him I looked up this
[56:16] word diligently seek again it's
[56:18] translated in two words diligently seek
[56:20] but it comes from one Greek
[56:22] word and it and it's it's translated uh
[56:26] to seek carefully to inquire to seek
[56:30] after the definition is an
[56:34] investigation a subject of subtle
[56:36] inquiry and
[56:37] dispute I thought that was really
[56:39] interesting that
[56:42] God um without faith it's impossible to
[56:46] please God for he that cometh to God
[56:48] must believe that he is and that he's a
[56:51] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[56:54] him those that are investigating
[56:58] God seeking after God and there's a
[57:01] reward for that I I love this scripture
[57:05] because so many times we we we come to
[57:08] the place where we say well I
[57:10] believe well it's wonderful to believe
[57:13] but when we look at the scriptures
[57:15] believing always produced something all
[57:18] the way through and down the Bible the
[57:20] believing always produced the life in
[57:23] this kind of believing amen you must
[57:25] believe that he is is but you also must
[57:27] believe he's a rewarder of those that
[57:29] seek after him to investigate to inquire
[57:31] after and and and it makes me believe
[57:35] that God is pleased when we seek after
[57:37] him and want to know and investigate his
[57:40] things because if we believe in him we
[57:43] we we can only come to him if we believe
[57:44] in him but if we come to him we should
[57:46] seek after him
[57:49] diligently not this I believe and then I
[57:52] go on about life and I'm so busy with
[57:54] work and I'm so busy with a house and
[57:56] I'm so busy with school and I'm so busy
[57:57] with all of these things that this is
[57:59] what I do but I believe so I'm okay no
[58:02] you got to believe amen that he is but
[58:04] he's also a rewarder of those that
[58:06] investigate him and seek after him and
[58:08] want
[58:09] him and want to know him and want to
[58:12] know about him and want to experience
[58:14] him more deeply amen striving reaching
[58:17] forth in the spirit seeking amen those
[58:20] are the ones that he rewards
[58:23] amen amen it's not a reward because you
[58:25] did the checkbox of Good Deeds he
[58:28] rewards them who seeks after him and I
[58:31] wonder what he rewards them
[58:35] with well probably good health and long
[58:38] life and
[58:40] no because what are they doing they're
[58:43] diligently seeking him so what would be
[58:46] the reward for those who are diligently
[58:48] seeking him maybe he reveals more of
[58:52] himself that's the reward I would want
[58:55] if I'm a diligent seeker of him the
[58:57] reward I want is not long life and good
[58:59] health and all that the reward I want is
[59:02] him because I'm a diligent seeker of him
[59:05] so what would I want I would want the
[59:07] thing that I'm diligently seeking after
[59:10] not diligently seeking after a good
[59:12] retirement not diligently seeking after
[59:13] a work promotion not diligently seeking
[59:15] after a piece of property but diligently
[59:18] seeking after him my reward would not be
[59:21] any of those things but my reward would
[59:23] be more of him amen
[59:26] because that's what faith will produce
[59:29] that's what true faith will bring that
[59:32] kind of
[59:34] Desire brother M tells us that Satan
[59:37] didn't
[59:38] believe he said he believes the word we
[59:41] know that Devils believe and they
[59:43] tremble amen but he didn't believe this
[59:47] manifestation of the word when it come
[59:49] to this brother B said he couldn't
[59:51] believe that humble little
[59:53] man being that word he believed that God
[59:57] would send a son he believed there would
[59:59] be a messiah the devil believed all of
[1:00:01] that but when he saw it coming in this
[1:00:03] humble little man of Jesus Christ he
[1:00:05] didn't believe that was him so when he
[1:00:06] tempted him in the wilderness he was
[1:00:08] saying prove it to me prove it to me
[1:00:10] prove it to me but Jesus had nothing to
[1:00:13] prove because he knew who he was amen
[1:00:16] because he knew who he was he could just
[1:00:18] combat the word he could just combat
[1:00:20] with the word and just keep bringing the
[1:00:21] word because Jesus never came to this
[1:00:24] earth to prove identifi himself he came
[1:00:27] to do the father's
[1:00:30] will he didn't come to identify himself
[1:00:33] and declare himself he came to declare
[1:00:35] the father amen so because of that that
[1:00:39] Satan didn't believe and then brother
[1:00:41] Ben moves to
[1:00:43] Judas and he makes this statement in the
[1:00:45] message
[1:00:46] identification he what made him turn he
[1:00:48] actually doubted the claims of Christ
[1:00:50] being the word he could see that man eat
[1:00:53] with him fish with him out there and
[1:00:55] everything else and him being the word
[1:00:56] he could believe it he couldn't believe
[1:00:59] he was God but he he but he was judas's
[1:01:03] character used him to do this has your
[1:01:05] character done the same so brother
[1:01:07] saying that Judas it wasn't that Judas
[1:01:10] didn't believe that Jesus was a man of
[1:01:11] God it wasn't that he didn't believe he
[1:01:13] was a prophet or a holy man or a miracle
[1:01:16] worker he saw all of that he believed
[1:01:18] all of that but what he doubted was that
[1:01:21] that man amen that that man he doubted
[1:01:24] the claims of Jesus Jesus Christ being
[1:01:26] the word he couldn't believe he was
[1:01:31] God but he was
[1:01:35] am and lean not to your own
[1:01:37] understanding and again goes into Judas
[1:01:39] he says there was one man who did Lean
[1:01:42] to his own understanding and his name
[1:01:44] was Judas the scariot I don't see how he
[1:01:47] could have done it he had walked face to
[1:01:49] face with Christ just like Eve did in
[1:01:50] the beginning he had seen the
[1:01:52] Vindication he had looked at God in the
[1:01:53] face like Eve did in the cool of the
[1:01:55] evening Eve looked at Christ in the cool
[1:01:57] of the evening in the garden and Judas
[1:01:59] had sat in the cool of the evening in
[1:02:00] the Garden of Gethsemane in many places
[1:02:02] and had looked at the same Christ and
[1:02:04] had heard him teach prove himself by the
[1:02:06] word Vindicated by to be the prophet
[1:02:08] that Moses had spoke of would be raised
[1:02:10] up and told them in the scripture who he
[1:02:12] was and all about it they had seen it
[1:02:14] proved by God that he was and then he
[1:02:16] leaned to his own
[1:02:19] understanding oh how could he do it it
[1:02:22] was because he never had it down here in
[1:02:25] the first place he wasn't a gerti
[1:02:29] seed
[1:02:31] amen he was the son of
[1:02:34] predition What Judas had every Advantage
[1:02:39] friends
[1:02:41] yeah we would think it's impossible for
[1:02:44] him not to
[1:02:45] believe he walked with him talked with
[1:02:48] him he he didn't just hear the parable
[1:02:50] he heard the explanation of the parable
[1:02:53] when they went to eat dinner and they
[1:02:55] said explain to us and he explained to
[1:02:57] them yeah amen he wasn't just there for
[1:02:59] the sermon he was there for the
[1:03:00] explanation amen he wasn't just there at
[1:03:03] the healing campaigns amen but he was
[1:03:05] working behind the scenes and he saw
[1:03:07] everything that L up led up to it he saw
[1:03:08] every Miracle he said every stage of the
[1:03:10] journey he was there in the boat when he
[1:03:12] said peace be still he was in the boat
[1:03:14] when Jesus came Walking In The Water he
[1:03:16] saw Peter walk on water he had every
[1:03:19] Advantage friends I mean you you and I
[1:03:21] go back and we try to imagine how in the
[1:03:23] world could Judas do what he did it was
[1:03:26] because he didn't have a gerti seed on
[1:03:28] the inside he was just doing it from the
[1:03:30] intellectual realm and intellectually
[1:03:32] could say he walked on the water Judas
[1:03:35] never denied
[1:03:36] it he broke bread and fed 5,000 he never
[1:03:40] would deny that that was all truth and
[1:03:42] he saw it and could witness it was the
[1:03:43] truth the problem he had is he couldn't
[1:03:46] believe that that man was actually God
[1:03:47] in the Fulfillment of all that scripture
[1:03:49] why it takes a seed Gene of God
[1:03:52] am he couldn't fully accept the word for
[1:03:55] his
[1:03:56] today brother bam said is your life
[1:03:58] worthy the gospel he said I was telling
[1:04:00] someone this afternoon in a little
[1:04:02] meeting I said every son that's born of
[1:04:03] God has to be tried first
[1:04:07] chastened I remember when I had mine or
[1:04:10] my greatest hour when a man is born
[1:04:12] again there's a little spot like the
[1:04:14] size of his fingernail that God injects
[1:04:16] into him system and it falls into his
[1:04:18] heart and there anchors then Satan makes
[1:04:21] him prove it and if it ain't there
[1:04:23] you're gone
[1:04:26] I don't ask me questions on what that
[1:04:28] thing is the size of your finger now I
[1:04:30] don't know all I know is what brother
[1:04:31] Benham
[1:04:32] said something God injects of his own
[1:04:34] life there and there's got to be a seed
[1:04:36] already there for it to connect
[1:04:38] with and when it does when that comes
[1:04:41] Satan will make you prove that it's
[1:04:44] there yeah and if it ain't there you're
[1:04:48] gone brother B says I remember mine said
[1:04:52] my greatest hour when my my brother had
[1:04:54] died and my father had died then my wife
[1:04:58] died and then my baby died and I stood
[1:05:00] there at the at the side of my baby's
[1:05:03] crib there in the hospital cheing the
[1:05:04] flies away her eyes Crossing cuz she's
[1:05:07] suffering her dying amen and like a
[1:05:09] black sheet come down God wouldn't even
[1:05:11] answer me and the devil goes to speaking
[1:05:13] to me and he starts saying amen how
[1:05:15] could God how could you say he's a good
[1:05:17] God and he won't heal your he said he
[1:05:19] all he would have to do is just move his
[1:05:21] finger and brother bam started saying
[1:05:23] that was right he says After all you've
[1:05:25] done for him he said that's right
[1:05:27] staying up all night preaching that's
[1:05:29] right and brother bam was starting to
[1:05:30] agree with the intellectual reasoning of
[1:05:33] the devil how could he be a good God and
[1:05:36] you've preached out here he's a Healer
[1:05:37] and he's a good God he won't even he
[1:05:39] done it for others but he won't even do
[1:05:41] it for you when it comes to your own
[1:05:42] baby and brother brandham was he said
[1:05:44] this was my darkest hour this is his
[1:05:46] hardest trial this is when God was
[1:05:48] making this was when God was proving a
[1:05:52] son listen God is not proving Us in good
[1:05:55] times and God is not proving us when
[1:05:56] we're sitting in church hearing the
[1:05:57] preaching and everybody saying amen and
[1:05:59] we're saying amen with everybody but God
[1:06:02] is going to prove his child and what's
[1:06:03] he going to do look at what he did for
[1:06:05] the prophet look at what he did for
[1:06:07] everybody in the Bible to prove that
[1:06:08] they were his children amen they he
[1:06:10] throws them into the circumstances that
[1:06:12] are impossible into a lion's den into a
[1:06:14] fiery furnace into all kinds of
[1:06:17] situations why because there's something
[1:06:19] inside that will believe
[1:06:22] Amen brother said somebody told him
[1:06:25] after tells his testimony he says uh
[1:06:27] it's a good thing you held on to your
[1:06:30] religion and brother B said I never held
[1:06:32] on to it it held on to
[1:06:34] me if it wasn't for that predestinated
[1:06:37] seed he would have fallen in that hour
[1:06:38] brother Brenham was weak he was tired he
[1:06:41] was believing the reasoning the only
[1:06:43] thing that held him was there was
[1:06:44] something inside to believe
[1:06:46] with and the word tells us that we're
[1:06:48] saved by grace through faith and that
[1:06:50] none of ourselves it is a gift of God so
[1:06:53] brother B took no credit for holding on
[1:06:55] he took no credit for having great faith
[1:06:57] he took no credit for overcoming he said
[1:06:59] it was something in me holding
[1:07:03] on brother B says uh and the show us the
[1:07:06] father he says but sometimes God lets
[1:07:09] Affliction hit his people to test them
[1:07:12] for their faith he was testing a saint
[1:07:16] not rebuking a sinner and God does that
[1:07:19] to test he did it to
[1:07:22] job he didn't do it to job because job
[1:07:24] was a bad man he had brother B said he
[1:07:26] had confidence in job and he wanted to
[1:07:28] prove job
[1:07:30] yeah what does that say for you and
[1:07:33] I maybe he's got more confidence in us
[1:07:35] than we have in us and it's not us he
[1:07:37] has confidence in he knows what's
[1:07:41] inside he knows how to get the life to
[1:07:44] manifest and to get the life to manifest
[1:07:47] amen there's got to be faith that
[1:07:49] overcomes an obstacle for Faith to
[1:07:52] manifest there must be a challenge to
[1:07:54] Faith amen
[1:07:57] brother man makes this statement I
[1:07:59] thought it was so
[1:08:00] interesting he said there was a uh there
[1:08:04] was them kind like Nicodemus the secret
[1:08:07] believer come by Night slipped around
[1:08:09] said Rabbi we know you're a teacher from
[1:08:11] comes from God no man can do these
[1:08:13] things you do except God be with him
[1:08:15] look at little
[1:08:17] gyrus now now remember in the day that
[1:08:22] the these men were there gyrus was the
[1:08:25] the chief of the synagogue Amen in that
[1:08:28] time there was such a fuss over Jesus
[1:08:30] such a polarization that if you claim to
[1:08:32] be his disciple you were no longer
[1:08:34] allowed to come back to the synagogue
[1:08:36] there was a pressure coming from the
[1:08:38] high priest and all of that and so now
[1:08:40] that's why Nicodemus came to Jesus by
[1:08:42] night so that he wouldn't be seen
[1:08:44] because of all the religious pressure
[1:08:45] that was around him gyrus was a secret
[1:08:48] believer he was the chief of the
[1:08:49] sinagogue but he was a secret believer
[1:08:51] but listen what brother Brenham said
[1:08:52] look at gyrus he maybe acted like he
[1:08:55] didn't believe in Divine Healing till
[1:08:57] his little daughter was laying at the
[1:08:58] point of
[1:09:00] death God has a way of pulling that out
[1:09:03] and making you show your
[1:09:10] color and then when it come right down
[1:09:12] to the spot he was a Believer and it
[1:09:15] just had to come to a spot to make him
[1:09:17] see
[1:09:18] it you know we we see people go through
[1:09:21] things and we sometimes think in
[1:09:23] ourselves I could never go through a
[1:09:24] trial like that
[1:09:26] they lost a loved one maybe lost a child
[1:09:28] maybe had a a major rejection something
[1:09:30] horrible in your life he say I can never
[1:09:33] I could never I can never and the
[1:09:35] reality is you can never but if God's
[1:09:37] placed something down inside of you
[1:09:38] there's a faith that can overcome every
[1:09:40] Challenge and every obstacle to Faith
[1:09:43] and sometimes we don't know how much a
[1:09:45] Believer we are amen we don't know
[1:09:48] what's on the inside of us so God Amen
[1:09:50] will allow a little something to come
[1:09:52] and J gyrus wasn't sure he believed in
[1:09:54] Divine Healing maybe gyrus was a little
[1:09:56] secret believer but God would let his
[1:09:58] daughter come to the point of death amen
[1:10:00] so now he didn't care what the what the
[1:10:03] chief priest said he didn't care what
[1:10:05] Jerusalem Council said now he knew that
[1:10:08] this man has power in him that can heal
[1:10:10] my daughter I know it and now it didn't
[1:10:12] matter what anybody saw or what anybody
[1:10:14] thought the circumstance drew the faith
[1:10:16] that was hiding in gyrus and brought it
[1:10:18] to the surface for everybody to
[1:10:21] see because remember there was a
[1:10:23] multitude pressing Jesus so tight amen
[1:10:26] gyrus comes up to him when he comes out
[1:10:27] of the boat he crosses back over the sea
[1:10:29] there's a press there's so many people
[1:10:31] there and he says please come and heal
[1:10:34] my daughter what's he doing he's making
[1:10:36] a public confession that I believe that
[1:10:38] you can come heal my daughter amen now
[1:10:40] it didn't matter what anybody else in
[1:10:42] that City thought amen he didn't care
[1:10:44] about his reputation anymore God was
[1:10:46] drawing true genuine Faith out of the
[1:10:49] man and God knows how to do it to us too
[1:10:55] because he knows what's on the inside
[1:10:57] amen he knew it was in job so he
[1:10:58] squeezed him he knew it was in all of
[1:11:01] his children so he could put the Press
[1:11:03] on them because what came out was Faith
[1:11:06] let's go to Genesis 22
[1:11:30] if I could just
[1:11:32] say if we believe what brother bandam
[1:11:35] said in is your life worthy of the
[1:11:38] Gospel that the ability inside to
[1:11:40] believe the word for our day is our
[1:11:43] credentials of
[1:11:46] identification listen if we could just
[1:11:48] come to that
[1:11:50] realization that that's something God
[1:11:52] put in me before the foundation of the
[1:11:54] world that would come like a magnet
[1:11:56] drawn to this word and that's my
[1:11:58] identification as a Son of
[1:12:00] God now I don't need to get tempted by
[1:12:03] the devil to start proving
[1:12:05] things like the devil come to Jesus if
[1:12:08] thou be the Son of God do this and if
[1:12:10] thou be do this and if thou be do that
[1:12:14] Jesus was never there to vindicate or
[1:12:16] declare himself so he never took the
[1:12:18] bait guess what you and I are not here
[1:12:20] to declare ourselves we're not here to
[1:12:23] prove we're sons of God we are not here
[1:12:24] to prove that we are we're not here to
[1:12:26] prove anything we are here Amen to we
[1:12:29] are here to identify him just like Jesus
[1:12:33] was here to identify his father so he
[1:12:35] would only do what the father showed him
[1:12:37] he wasn't doing anything to prove to
[1:12:38] Satan that he was a Son of God he was
[1:12:40] willing for everybody to doubt who he
[1:12:42] was because he had nothing to prove he
[1:12:44] knew who he was he was only there to
[1:12:46] declare the father and you and I are
[1:12:48] only here to declare our bridegroom and
[1:12:51] so it doesn't matter what anybody says
[1:12:53] what they think and how much they deny
[1:12:55] you're not a Believer and you're not a
[1:12:56] this cuz you don't believe that and you
[1:12:58] don't do this listen don't start jumping
[1:13:00] through the devil's hoops and trying to
[1:13:02] prove amen you'll never satisfy the
[1:13:04] devil he'll come with another question
[1:13:06] or another standard or another set of
[1:13:08] circumstances to prove it you have
[1:13:09] nothing to prove you're not here to
[1:13:11] prove yourself you're here to identify
[1:13:14] Christ and when Christ wants to show
[1:13:16] himself in you he knows how to put the
[1:13:18] squeeze down to get himself out yeah
[1:13:23] amen so go
[1:13:25] God now if we can just come to a true
[1:13:28] identification of our sunship Who We Are
[1:13:31] by God's grace by the revelation of the
[1:13:33] hour by the identification that the
[1:13:35] prophet gave us now if we could just
[1:13:37] learn to rest when we hit the
[1:13:39] circumstances because circumstances will
[1:13:42] not change who we are amen circumstances
[1:13:46] are not
[1:13:49] identification yeah amen our faith in
[1:13:52] the revealed word for our day is our
[1:13:53] identification yeah
[1:13:56] so now let the wheels fall off the
[1:14:00] bus let everything fall into
[1:14:03] ruin let's stop running around with duct
[1:14:07] tape to save save our reputation or save
[1:14:11] this or I won't look like this or just
[1:14:13] let it all fall to
[1:14:16] ruin because it doesn't matter what
[1:14:19] somebody else thinks about me amen God's
[1:14:22] given me a witness in my heart I don't
[1:14:25] have anything to prove to anybody I'm
[1:14:26] not here to make anybody think I'm a Son
[1:14:29] of
[1:14:31] God I'm only here to manifest his life
[1:14:34] when he wants a manifestation out of me
[1:14:36] amen and until he wants a manifestation
[1:14:39] out of me I just sit
[1:14:40] quiet that's what Jesus did amen until
[1:14:44] the father showed him the father when
[1:14:46] the father wanted to declare another
[1:14:47] part of his word he brought it through
[1:14:49] the sun until then Jesus sat quiet he
[1:14:52] went to the he went to the trial and
[1:14:54] pilot at all never said a word didn't
[1:14:56] defend himself didn't need to defend
[1:14:58] himself he wasn't there to defend
[1:15:01] himself oh friends let's not get nervous
[1:15:04] every time we start getting into a
[1:15:05] situation let's just say hey if God
[1:15:08] wants to manifest himself he'll manifest
[1:15:10] he knows how to do it I don't know what
[1:15:11] he's doing I don't understand the
[1:15:13] circumstances but I know who I am and I
[1:15:15] know he loves me and I know all things
[1:15:17] work together for the good that
[1:15:18] everything's ticking right on time that
[1:15:20] nothing's out of cater with God I don't
[1:15:22] have to start getting all nervous and
[1:15:24] wonder am I Son of God am I a message
[1:15:26] believer am I this and that that's the
[1:15:28] trick of the devil we need to go back to
[1:15:30] the beginning and say what makes me a
[1:15:32] Believer what makes me a Believer is I
[1:15:39] believe and then God knows how to
[1:15:41] manifest
[1:15:44] himself and we go to Genesis
[1:15:49] 22 verse one and it came to pass after
[1:15:52] these things that God did tempt Abraham
[1:15:55] and sent un Toto him Abraham and he said
[1:15:57] behold here I am and he said take now
[1:16:00] thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou
[1:16:03] lovest and get thee into the land of
[1:16:06] Mariah and offer him there for a burnt
[1:16:08] offering upon one of the mountains which
[1:16:10] I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up
[1:16:12] early in the morning and and saddled his
[1:16:14] ass and he took two of his young men
[1:16:16] with him and Isaac his son enclaved the
[1:16:19] wood for the burnt offering and Rose up
[1:16:20] and went into the place which God had
[1:16:22] told him
[1:16:25] when God comes to Abraham and speaks to
[1:16:29] him God
[1:16:31] is proving
[1:16:34] Abraham this is a test I think like
[1:16:37] unlike any
[1:16:39] other amen Abraham take thy son you know
[1:16:42] the one you waited 25 years for you know
[1:16:46] the one you were mocked and laughed at
[1:16:47] over yeah because you told him that
[1:16:49] you're going to have a son by by Sarah
[1:16:52] and everybody laughed and then you got
[1:16:53] older and you got older you got old and
[1:16:55] everybody mocked you and and they
[1:16:57] laughed and and they said every year it
[1:16:59] was another joke you had that baby yet
[1:17:01] brother brother Abraham and no nope but
[1:17:03] I still believe God and now take that
[1:17:06] very thing amen that Vindicated I told
[1:17:08] you the truth take it and slay it
[1:17:11] yeah and Abraham didn't
[1:17:14] argue he got up got the wood got the
[1:17:19] servants got the son got the knife got
[1:17:22] everything he needed and went by this
[1:17:24] time in in Abraham's Journey he had
[1:17:26] learned a few
[1:17:27] things let's go let's go down uh to
[1:17:31] verse
[1:17:33] 11 and the angel of the Lord called onto
[1:17:35] him out of heaven and abrah and said
[1:17:37] Abraham Abraham and he said here am I
[1:17:39] and he said lay not thine hand upon the
[1:17:42] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[1:17:44] for now I know that thou fearest God
[1:17:47] seeing thou has not withheld thy son
[1:17:49] thine only son from
[1:17:51] me the question is was God in doubt
[1:17:54] whether Abraham loved him or
[1:17:56] not but God was proving a son and he was
[1:18:00] bringing a manifestation out of Abraham
[1:18:02] amen for you and
[1:18:04] I and in the Book of Romans if you go
[1:18:07] with me to Romans chapter 4 I want to
[1:18:10] read two different takes on this action
[1:18:13] one from Paul and one from James and if
[1:18:16] we could just go through it together and
[1:18:17] just take a couple
[1:18:19] minutes Romans chapter 4
[1:18:31] Romans chapter 4 verse
[1:18:35] one what shall we then say that Abraham
[1:18:38] our father has pertaining to the flesh
[1:18:39] ha found for If Abraham were justified
[1:18:41] by works Heath wear of to Glory but not
[1:18:44] before God for what sayith the scripture
[1:18:46] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[1:18:48] to him for righteousness now him that
[1:18:51] worketh is the reward not reckoned of
[1:18:53] Grace but of debt but to him that
[1:18:54] worketh not but believeth on him that
[1:18:57] justifieth the ungodly his faith is
[1:18:59] counted for righteousness so in the eyes
[1:19:02] of God what made Abraham righteous was
[1:19:04] it his works or his faith it was his
[1:19:07] faith but then if we go to Romans
[1:19:09] Chapter 2 if we skip on over to Romans
[1:19:11] Chapter 2 and brother REM does such a
[1:19:14] good job of explaining the difference
[1:19:17] between Paul and James and we're not
[1:19:19] going to go into all of that I just want
[1:19:20] to highlight
[1:19:22] it James chapter 2
[1:19:25] verse
[1:19:28] 17 James chapter 2:1 17 even so faith if
[1:19:31] it hath not works is dead being alone
[1:19:34] yes a man may say thou Hast faith and I
[1:19:36] have Works show me thy faith without thy
[1:19:38] works and I will show thee my faith by
[1:19:41] my Works thou believest that there is
[1:19:43] one God thou doest well the Devils also
[1:19:46] believe and tremble but wilt thou know
[1:19:50] oh vain man that faith without works is
[1:19:52] dead was not Abraham Our Father
[1:19:54] justified by works when he had offered
[1:19:56] Isaac his son upon the altar seeing thou
[1:19:59] how Faith wrought with his works and by
[1:20:01] works was Faith made perfect and the
[1:20:03] scripture was fulfilled which sayith
[1:20:04] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:20:06] unto him for righteousness and he was
[1:20:08] called the friend of God you see then
[1:20:11] how that by works a man is Justified and
[1:20:14] not by faith
[1:20:16] only does that sound different than what
[1:20:18] Paul
[1:20:19] said Paul said a man's not saved by
[1:20:22] works but by faith and now James is
[1:20:24] saying you're not saved by faith only
[1:20:26] but by
[1:20:27] works and brother brandham goes and he
[1:20:29] and he starts to break this down and and
[1:20:31] he says uh works his faith Express and
[1:20:34] this is the message where he really
[1:20:35] explains it he said what God saw in
[1:20:38] Abraham was his faith but the works was
[1:20:42] what man saw of Abraham's Faith so
[1:20:45] Abraham's Faith didn't need to be
[1:20:47] displayed to God God already knew that
[1:20:49] he believed but his faith had to be on
[1:20:51] display for others to see his faith and
[1:20:53] that's what James was saying show me
[1:20:55] your faith without your works but I'll
[1:20:57] show you my faith by my works because
[1:21:00] what I believe will produce a life what
[1:21:03] I believe the faith has an effect on me
[1:21:06] and the effect it has on me will
[1:21:08] reproduce something out of me amen
[1:21:10] because I truly believe everybody in the
[1:21:13] Bible who truly believed God that Faith
[1:21:16] had an effect on them and they moved
[1:21:18] into a
[1:21:20] demonstration and Daniel demonstration
[1:21:23] Noah demonstration Moses demonstration
[1:21:26] David demonstrated tell me one person
[1:21:28] that just believed God and there was no
[1:21:30] demonstration of their faith in the
[1:21:31] Bible the Bible is a record of their
[1:21:33] faith on
[1:21:35] demonstration so true Faith always
[1:21:38] brings a
[1:21:39] manifestation always because faith has
[1:21:42] an effect on us because if we believe it
[1:21:44] it changes everything about us if we
[1:21:46] genuinely believe it it changes the way
[1:21:48] we think it changes the way we act it
[1:21:50] changes all of our conduct and it
[1:21:51] changes what comes out of us amen
[1:21:54] because it's genuine
[1:21:57] faith and we know we get a little
[1:21:59] insight from the book of Hebrews because
[1:22:01] the book of Hebrews tells us what was
[1:22:03] going on in Abraham's mind that's what
[1:22:05] we don't know in Genesis 22 in Genesis
[1:22:07] 22 we hear a commission we hear him get
[1:22:09] up we hear him go do it and we hear that
[1:22:11] God is pleased with him amen but we
[1:22:12] don't know what's going on inside of
[1:22:14] Abraham and we can only imagine can you
[1:22:16] only imagine if God told you to take
[1:22:18] your son your only son that you waited
[1:22:20] 25 years for and slay him can you
[1:22:22] imagine the thoughts that would go on in
[1:22:23] your mind
[1:22:25] yeah but it says in Hebrews 11:17 by
[1:22:28] faith Abraham when he was tried offered
[1:22:31] up
[1:22:32] Isaac and he that had received the
[1:22:35] promise offered up his only begotten son
[1:22:38] of whom it was said that in Isaac shall
[1:22:40] thy seed be called accounting that God
[1:22:43] was able to raise him up even from the
[1:22:45] dead from whence also he received him in
[1:22:48] a
[1:22:49] figure you know what that tells
[1:22:51] me that Abraham was walking up there to
[1:22:55] that place of
[1:22:57] sacrifice and although God was asking
[1:22:59] him to do something that was completely
[1:23:01] contrary to his
[1:23:03] thinking completely contrary to
[1:23:06] reasoning Abraham was walking there by
[1:23:09] faith according to Hebrews 11 and what
[1:23:11] was his faith in his faith was in the
[1:23:13] original promise God gave him I will
[1:23:16] give you a son and I will raise him up
[1:23:18] and he will be a father of Nations
[1:23:21] and so now Abraham's saying God can't
[1:23:24] lie Li God can't lie he told me in Isaac
[1:23:29] shall my seed be in Isaac a father of
[1:23:31] Nations and Isaac will be the blessing
[1:23:33] God can't lie God's telling me to kill
[1:23:35] him what does that mean I don't know but
[1:23:38] God can raise him up because I received
[1:23:40] him from the dead now he can raise him
[1:23:41] up for the I don't know what God will do
[1:23:43] but I'm going to go slay him in faith
[1:23:45] and faith in what faith in the original
[1:23:48] promise God gave him oh God help us to
[1:23:51] have this kind of faith if God called
[1:23:53] you and told you you're a a son or
[1:23:54] daughter of God if he revealed to you
[1:23:56] himself amen and that's your new birth
[1:23:58] what is the new birth Jesus Christ
[1:24:00] revealed to you personally now nothing
[1:24:03] that comes after that will change that
[1:24:04] original promise your circumstances your
[1:24:08] difficulties when everybody turns
[1:24:10] against you when everything goes sour in
[1:24:11] life it doesn't change the fact that
[1:24:14] he's introduced himself to
[1:24:16] you and he's become one with you Abraham
[1:24:20] in the trial of his life wasn't doubting
[1:24:23] the word
[1:24:25] yeah it's not that Abraham just went up
[1:24:28] there in obedience with no faith with I
[1:24:31] don't know what's no he didn't know it
[1:24:33] was going to happen but he he he
[1:24:34] believed God's
[1:24:36] word he offered up his son by
[1:24:41] faith Jesus says in Matthew chapter 7
[1:24:43] turn with me in Matthew chapter
[1:24:48] 7 and I want to finish up looking at a
[1:24:50] few thoughts here not that I'm finishing
[1:24:53] don't get the wrong idea
[1:24:55] we're just moving into the home
[1:24:57] stretch we maybe rounded one of the last
[1:25:01] Corners Matthew chapter
[1:25:08] 7 Matthew chapter
[1:25:11] 7 verse
[1:25:23] 21 he says not everyone that saith unto
[1:25:27] me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:25:30] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[1:25:32] will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:25:35] amen many will say unto me in that day
[1:25:38] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:25:40] name and in thy name have cast out
[1:25:41] devils and in thy name done many
[1:25:43] wonderful works then will I profess unto
[1:25:46] them I never knew you depart from me ye
[1:25:48] that work
[1:25:51] iniquity amen
[1:25:54] it goes to
[1:25:55] show that
[1:25:57] Jesus he's saying not everyone that
[1:26:00] saith unto me Lord Lord they were
[1:26:01] calling Jesus
[1:26:03] Lord but just because they called him
[1:26:05] Lord didn't make him their lord
[1:26:08] yeah and he says you sayith unto me Lord
[1:26:12] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:26:13] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[1:26:15] Father which is in heaven and if you
[1:26:18] read this it can almost look like it's
[1:26:20] works now again what James was saying
[1:26:23] that not just that says Lord Lord but he
[1:26:25] that doeth the will of my father but I
[1:26:27] think it goes back to the same
[1:26:29] principle that it's not just those who
[1:26:32] say Lord Lord or call him Lord or
[1:26:34] believe in him as Lord but those who
[1:26:36] have genuine faith will always produce
[1:26:40] an outcome what is the outcome they will
[1:26:44] keep the word amen not just ones who say
[1:26:48] Lord Lord but those who actually do the
[1:26:49] will of my father how is it we do the
[1:26:51] will of the father not by human effort
[1:26:53] not listen not by Creed not by Dogma but
[1:26:56] by faith amen how was it that Abraham
[1:26:59] did the will of God by faith how is it
[1:27:01] we and I do it by faith because our
[1:27:03] faith will produce a
[1:27:04] life let's go a little further let's go
[1:27:07] over to Luke chapter 6
[1:27:12] now this is where I really want to drill
[1:27:15] down and this is I'm really getting to
[1:27:17] the context of what I've been meditating
[1:27:18] on what I've been thinking about what
[1:27:20] God's been dealing with in my heart
[1:27:24] Luke chapter
[1:27:26] 6 verse 46 Luke 6 and
[1:27:31] 46 he says and why call ye me Lord Lord
[1:27:36] and do not the things which I
[1:27:41] say this is in a very similar context to
[1:27:44] what he said in
[1:27:45] Matthew why call you me Lord Lord and do
[1:27:48] not the things which I say because the
[1:27:51] very term Lord is showing lordship and
[1:27:54] rulership and showing submission yes so
[1:27:58] the very title of Lord when we say you
[1:28:01] are Lord Lord Jesus I love you Lord when
[1:28:04] you call him Lord you're saying you're
[1:28:06] the master and I'm the servant I'm
[1:28:08] submission to you so then Jesus is
[1:28:11] asking a very fair question he said why
[1:28:13] do you call me Lord Lord and don't do
[1:28:15] the things which I say it doesn't make
[1:28:18] sense like it doesn't make sense for to
[1:28:20] say lord lord it's like you go to work
[1:28:22] and you say hey boss
[1:28:24] and you don't do anything the boss says
[1:28:27] and the boss could say why do you keep
[1:28:28] calling me boss if you won't do anything
[1:28:30] I tell you to do this is very similar to
[1:28:33] what Jesus it's it's a very fair
[1:28:35] question why do you call me Lord Lord
[1:28:37] and you keep doing whatever you want
[1:28:39] yeah why you call me Lord Lord and you
[1:28:40] won't heed my word why do you call me
[1:28:41] Lord Lord and you won't obey what I say
[1:28:44] Amen you're just saying something out of
[1:28:46] your mouth and remember what I said in
[1:28:47] the beginning talk is
[1:28:49] cheap anybody can say
[1:28:52] anything but Jesus right through
[1:28:55] it he
[1:28:58] said
[1:29:00] uh let yeah let's go to John chapter
[1:29:04] N I want to add this scripture into the
[1:29:07] last two I read and then we'll talk
[1:29:09] about
[1:29:12] it John chapter
[1:29:17] n John 9:39
[1:29:27] and Jesus said for judgment I come into
[1:29:29] this world that they which see not might
[1:29:32] see and they which see might be made
[1:29:34] blind and some of the Pharisees which
[1:29:36] were with him heard these words and said
[1:29:38] unto him are we blind also Jesus said
[1:29:42] unto them if you were blind you should
[1:29:45] have no sin but now you say we see
[1:29:49] Therefore your sin remaineth
[1:29:56] see Jesus was willing to have mercy on
[1:29:58] them if they were
[1:30:00] blind but because they claim to see and
[1:30:03] to believe the word of God now he says
[1:30:06] because you say you see Therefore your
[1:30:09] sin remaineth because if you see why
[1:30:12] don't you
[1:30:14] do this is the question why called me
[1:30:16] Lord Lord and don't do if you say you
[1:30:18] see then why don't you do if you say we
[1:30:21] believe Moses then why don't you believe
[1:30:23] me what Jesus said he he says in John 5
[1:30:26] he says uh for had you believed in Moses
[1:30:30] you would believe in me for he wrote of
[1:30:32] me so the very statement I believe in
[1:30:35] Moses that statement became their
[1:30:38] condemnation yeah the very statement I
[1:30:40] see and I know the truth and I see the
[1:30:42] word and I see the light and I know what
[1:30:44] Moses said and I read the Bible that's
[1:30:46] very and the statement Lord Lord all of
[1:30:48] that becomes condemnation because if you
[1:30:50] see why don't you do if you understand
[1:30:53] why don't you do what he said amen and
[1:30:56] this is what Jesus is saying he says
[1:30:59] because because you say you see your sin
[1:31:01] remaineth because why you're manifesting
[1:31:04] unbelief if you say I see and then you
[1:31:06] don't do amen what is sin
[1:31:09] unbelief I see it but I don't believe it
[1:31:12] I see your manifestation but I don't
[1:31:14] believe it I see Moses and all that he
[1:31:16] said what Moses said is standing in
[1:31:17] front of you how can you claim to say I
[1:31:19] believe Moses but you don't believe me
[1:31:21] cuz Moses wrote of me right
[1:31:24] praise be to
[1:31:26] God brother Jesus also said if you love
[1:31:28] me keep my Commandments amen so what's
[1:31:33] he showing
[1:31:34] us he's showing us that if he's Lord if
[1:31:40] we believe he's Lord faith will produce
[1:31:43] an
[1:31:44] action I will surrender to him as
[1:31:47] Lord if we say we see and we have a
[1:31:50] revelation revelation will produce an
[1:31:52] action I the revelation will bring me
[1:31:55] into
[1:31:56] surrender
[1:31:58] obedience that we can say all kinds of
[1:32:01] things but the reality of it being true
[1:32:03] in our lives will manifest itself and
[1:32:06] that's what Jesus waso exposing their
[1:32:09] hypocrisy you say you believe but your
[1:32:12] actions show that you
[1:32:18] don't Jesus or when God called first
[1:32:24] Saul to be king of Israel he called him
[1:32:27] he exalted him he had Samuel anoint him
[1:32:30] and he went forth to do the work of God
[1:32:32] but he never fully obeyed God now he
[1:32:35] believed in God and he worshiped God and
[1:32:37] he believed Samuel was God's
[1:32:39] Prophet but he didn't do everything
[1:32:42] Samuel
[1:32:43] said which now all of a sudden makes you
[1:32:46] question did he believe Samuel was God's
[1:32:50] Prophet because if you truly believe
[1:32:52] Samuel was God's prophet the mouthpiece
[1:32:54] of God then if God said through Samuel
[1:32:58] then then I would do what Samuel said
[1:33:01] yeah because my faith tells me that that
[1:33:03] was God not Samuel right amen it's
[1:33:07] simple right yeah it's simple but why do
[1:33:09] we make it so complicated it's very very
[1:33:12] simple if that's God's prophet and that
[1:33:14] was God's Prophet speaking to me and I
[1:33:16] disregard what the prophet said my
[1:33:19] manifestation proves that I don't
[1:33:21] believe that's the mouthpiece of God or
[1:33:23] I don't believe in God or God's Not My
[1:33:25] Lord or whatever because if that's God
[1:33:27] speaking to me and I believe that it
[1:33:30] will have an effect on
[1:33:32] me and I can't just continue on doing
[1:33:35] what I'm doing if I believe
[1:33:38] that that doesn't mean people don't
[1:33:40] believe it but there's an intellectual
[1:33:41] faith and there's a genuine Faith
[1:33:44] amen so then he calls David now he tells
[1:33:47] Samuel don't worry Samuel I've got
[1:33:50] another king and this king is after my
[1:33:52] own heart
[1:33:54] and and he goes and anointing but when
[1:33:56] we pick it up in the book of Acts he
[1:33:58] begins to reveal what is his own heart
[1:34:00] he says he called David a man after his
[1:34:02] own heart that will do all my will so
[1:34:05] what is it to be after the heart of God
[1:34:07] to surrender and believe and Obey and
[1:34:12] manifest that Faith let's go to Mark
[1:34:16] 10 remember we're in the home stretch I
[1:34:19] don't want to lose anybody just because
[1:34:21] of
[1:34:22] time Mark chapter
[1:34:30] 10 Mark 10 verse1
[1:34:40] 17 says and when he was gone forth into
[1:34:42] the way there came one running and
[1:34:44] kneeling to him and asking him good
[1:34:46] Master what shall I do that I may
[1:34:48] inherit eternal life this is the story
[1:34:51] the Rich Young Ruler and brother B talks
[1:34:52] about it several times
[1:34:55] he kneeled to him and asked him good
[1:34:57] Master what shall I do that I might
[1:34:59] inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto
[1:35:02] him why callest thou me good there is
[1:35:04] none good but one that is God it looks
[1:35:07] here like like Jesus is rebuking him for
[1:35:09] saying a good Master but that's really
[1:35:12] not what he's doing he's testing his
[1:35:14] Revelation amen what brother BM tells us
[1:35:16] he's testing his Revelation he says why
[1:35:18] do you call me good right cuz there's
[1:35:21] only one good that's God so do you have
[1:35:23] the revelation of who I am or not why
[1:35:25] did you call me good
[1:35:28] amen I love when the prophet explains
[1:35:31] the scripture to us amen verse 19 thou
[1:35:34] knowest the Commandments do not commit
[1:35:36] adultery do not kill do not steal do not
[1:35:40] bear false witness defraud not honor thy
[1:35:42] father and thy mother and he answered
[1:35:44] and said unto him master all these have
[1:35:46] I done observed from my youth so I say
[1:35:50] he's
[1:35:51] qualified what do you think he did it
[1:35:54] all he must be a real believer verse 21
[1:35:58] then Jesus beholding him loved him said
[1:36:00] unto him one thing thou lackest go thy
[1:36:03] well way sell whatsoever thou Hast and
[1:36:05] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[1:36:08] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[1:36:10] cross and follow me and he was sad at
[1:36:14] that saying and went away grieved for he
[1:36:16] had great
[1:36:18] possessions let's go back to the
[1:36:20] beginning of this
[1:36:21] story when he was coming along the way
[1:36:24] there come one running up to him and
[1:36:27] kneeling and said good master master in
[1:36:30] Israel means teacher one with the
[1:36:32] authority to teach this man runs up to
[1:36:35] Jesus kneeling listen it look he looks
[1:36:39] super
[1:36:41] sincere I mean he's falling on his knee
[1:36:43] one knee two knees I don't know how many
[1:36:45] knees but he's falling down and he's
[1:36:47] saying good Master what must I do to
[1:36:49] inherit eternal life when you just look
[1:36:51] at that statement and look at that man
[1:36:53] you say oh he's so sincere he wants
[1:36:56] eternal life that man really loves
[1:37:00] God but his actions later proved that he
[1:37:04] didn't want
[1:37:07] God and it proved that he didn't believe
[1:37:09] Jesus was the good Master yeah right
[1:37:13] because if he was the good Master the
[1:37:14] perfect teacher amen the one that he
[1:37:16] could get the answer for how to have
[1:37:18] eternal life from if he really believed
[1:37:20] that when the answer came amen he would
[1:37:23] have taken the answer so he looked super
[1:37:26] sincere he looked genuine amen he had
[1:37:29] done all of these good things he had
[1:37:31] kept all of The Commandments from his
[1:37:32] youth he ran up kneeling in reverence
[1:37:35] and respect good Master what must I do
[1:37:37] to inherit eternal life and when he he
[1:37:39] went to the very spot amen that this man
[1:37:42] was struggling with and he says hey if
[1:37:44] you sell everything you have give to the
[1:37:46] poor take up your cross and follow after
[1:37:48] me you have treasure in heaven and he
[1:37:50] walked away grieved because he had much
[1:37:52] riches and all he did was
[1:37:55] proved he proved what he wanted the
[1:38:00] most he proved what he wanted the most
[1:38:04] what he wanted the most was his riches
[1:38:06] not eternal
[1:38:09] life you know when
[1:38:12] we when we preach like this it seems
[1:38:15] hard but it's real friends this is real
[1:38:18] life this is what we've seen all around
[1:38:21] us and people claim all kind of things
[1:38:24] we've claimed all kinds of things and
[1:38:26] when we come to find out when push came
[1:38:27] to shove my claim wasn't actually what
[1:38:29] was in my
[1:38:31] heart and God keeps working on us and
[1:38:34] working on us and working on us till
[1:38:36] everything of self starts getting out of
[1:38:38] the way till what comes out of our mouth
[1:38:40] and was really what's in our heart and
[1:38:41] God will make us prove it amen test
[1:38:48] us let's look at Luke 19
[1:39:01] this is the story of zakus and brother
[1:39:03] bam dramatizes this many times and tells
[1:39:06] zakus was a little tax collector and he
[1:39:08] was shrewd and he was also corrupt his
[1:39:12] wife had been praying for
[1:39:14] him Jesus is coming into town and it
[1:39:17] says in uh chapter 19:1 and Jesus
[1:39:19] entered and passed through Jericho
[1:39:21] behold there was a man named zakus which
[1:39:23] was the chief among the publicans and he
[1:39:26] was rich so who came to Jesus in The
[1:39:29] Last Story kneeling call him good Master
[1:39:31] it was a rich man here's another rich
[1:39:34] man only the last rich man that came
[1:39:37] kneeling looking so reverent and so
[1:39:39] honoring and good master that
[1:39:42] one that that rich one had done
[1:39:45] everything in his life
[1:39:47] right now we're coming to another rich
[1:39:50] man who has done everything in his life
[1:39:52] wrong
[1:39:54] amen he's crooked he's a thief he's
[1:39:57] stolen from people he's a crooked tax
[1:40:00] collector I don't know how you can get
[1:40:01] any worse than a crooked tax
[1:40:03] collector I mean we all love the IRS
[1:40:05] right I'm so glad there's nobody in the
[1:40:07] church that works for the
[1:40:12] IRS
[1:40:14] amen and it says and he sought to see
[1:40:16] Jesus who he was and could not for the
[1:40:18] Press because he was little of stature
[1:40:21] and he ran before and climbed up into a
[1:40:23] sick of more tree to see him for he was
[1:40:25] to pass that way and when Jesus came to
[1:40:28] the place he looked up and he saw him
[1:40:30] and he said zakus make haste and come
[1:40:32] down for today I must abide at thy house
[1:40:36] and he made haste and he came down and
[1:40:38] received him joyfully and when they saw
[1:40:40] it they all murmured saying that he was
[1:40:42] gone to be guested with a man that is a
[1:40:44] sinner and zachus stood and said unto
[1:40:47] the Lord behold Lord the the half of my
[1:40:50] goods I give to the poor and if I have
[1:40:52] taken any From Any Man by false
[1:40:54] accusations I restore him fourfold and
[1:40:58] Jesus said unto him this day is
[1:41:00] salvation come to this house for as much
[1:41:03] as he also is a son of
[1:41:07] Abraham do you see the different results
[1:41:09] in the two
[1:41:11] stories the Rich Young Ruler who had
[1:41:14] kept all of The Commandments believed
[1:41:16] Moses went to synagogue did everything
[1:41:19] right come to Jesus reverently
[1:41:21] respectfully kneeling down and calling
[1:41:23] him good Master when the good Master
[1:41:26] gave him the answer to his question he
[1:41:27] didn't want
[1:41:30] it he wanted his own money he didn't
[1:41:33] have faith everything that he was
[1:41:35] portraying wasn't what was really down
[1:41:37] on the
[1:41:38] inside he wanted life with no sacrifice
[1:41:41] he wanted to give up nothing and have
[1:41:42] everything he wanted the easy way now
[1:41:45] Jesus comes to zachus zachus does not
[1:41:47] come to him respectfully zakus does not
[1:41:49] come and kneel down zakus does not call
[1:41:51] him good master in the Dr traumatization
[1:41:53] brother bam said zakus had heard so much
[1:41:55] about him he was curious but he doubted
[1:41:57] if he was real and called him an
[1:41:59] impostor and said he's probably
[1:42:01] swindling the people why because zachus
[1:42:03] could believe that because that's his
[1:42:04] own
[1:42:05] nature he's he's putting his own nature
[1:42:08] Amen on to Jesus and he climbs up in a
[1:42:11] tree cuz he's not got respect for him
[1:42:13] he's not honoring him he's wanting to
[1:42:14] hide from him and he's just wanting to
[1:42:16] peep out and see what's really going on
[1:42:18] and Jesus comes under his tree and he
[1:42:20] knows by discernment zachus is up there
[1:42:23] and he says zakus come down for today I
[1:42:25] must go abide in your house and and
[1:42:27] Jesus comes to his house under much
[1:42:29] criticism because he goes to the house
[1:42:31] of a sinner but the reality is who was
[1:42:34] The
[1:42:34] Sinner who was The Sinner because sin is
[1:42:37] unbelief it was the rich young man who
[1:42:40] walked away from Jesus not this
[1:42:44] zakus he come reverently he come with
[1:42:47] all the accolades he come with all all
[1:42:49] the Commandments have been completed in
[1:42:51] his life he come ready amen and he he he
[1:42:55] did not
[1:42:56] believe zakus came the wrong
[1:43:01] way as soon as Jesus comes to
[1:43:04] dinner Z listen Jesus never told zakus
[1:43:09] what to do or what to say or what did he
[1:43:11] need for
[1:43:12] salvation zakus stood up and said Lord I
[1:43:17] give half of all my goods to the
[1:43:20] poor how did he know to do that
[1:43:23] Jesus never required it he never asked
[1:43:25] him to amen Jesus told the Rich Young
[1:43:28] Ruler if you do this you will get this
[1:43:32] Jesus never said that to zakus he never
[1:43:35] promised zakus anything this came out of
[1:43:37] the faith that was inside zachus he
[1:43:40] stood up he caught the Revelation and he
[1:43:42] realized amen half of everything I got I
[1:43:45] give to the poor if I stole anything
[1:43:47] from anybody I'll restore fourfold and
[1:43:49] you might say well you know the request
[1:43:51] of the Rich Young Ruler was give
[1:43:52] everything if he gave everything he
[1:43:54] wouldn't have anything to restore what
[1:43:55] he
[1:43:56] stole after he gives half to the poor
[1:43:59] and he pays back four times everything
[1:44:01] he's taken he may not have been left
[1:44:03] with a nickel to his name friends yeah
[1:44:07] how did he stand up and do what the Rich
[1:44:09] Young Ruler missed doing and the Rich
[1:44:11] Young Ruler heard the sermons heard the
[1:44:16] testimonies supposedly Liv the
[1:44:19] life but who had the life second he
[1:44:25] is because faith has an
[1:44:29] effect when he come in contact with
[1:44:33] Jesus Christ and recognize who this was
[1:44:35] it had an effect on him and that effect
[1:44:37] came into a
[1:44:41] manifestation how is it we could go to
[1:44:43] church and go to church and go to church
[1:44:45] and live for ourselves and live for
[1:44:46] ourselves and seek things of the
[1:44:49] world how is it that we can claim to
[1:44:52] love God and not not keep his
[1:44:53] Commandments how is it we can claim all
[1:44:55] of these things friends there's got to
[1:44:56] be a reality to our
[1:45:00] faith how is it that Samuel or Saul
[1:45:04] could call Samuel the prophet of God and
[1:45:06] when the prophet of God told Samuel slay
[1:45:09] everything keep nothing alive what was
[1:45:11] in Saul that he could keep things
[1:45:14] alive he didn't believe that this was
[1:45:16] the mouthpiece of God how could he if he
[1:45:20] had respect for God
[1:45:24] and because we say we see our sin
[1:45:27] remains I say friends if we say that we
[1:45:31] see that puts us in a
[1:45:34] responsibility
[1:45:36] amen if we believe there should be it
[1:45:39] should have an effect on
[1:45:42] us how many times we say we believe
[1:45:46] brother brandom is the mouthpiece of God
[1:45:48] he's a prophet to the age he's the
[1:45:50] generation it was the manifestation of
[1:45:52] Christ
[1:45:53] and then we leave our books lay weeks on
[1:45:55] end and we don't read what he said we
[1:45:58] don't listen to
[1:46:01] tapes what do we do keep doing what the
[1:46:04] Rich Young Ruler
[1:46:06] did but I say God if this really is
[1:46:10] you this really is the son of man come
[1:46:15] to reveal yourself to us how can I leave
[1:46:18] that book
[1:46:19] lay how can I not listen to your voice
[1:46:22] how can I not not worship with my
[1:46:24] brothers and sisters how can I not be at
[1:46:25] church how can I not hear the message
[1:46:27] preach how can I
[1:46:29] not see friends our faith has to have an
[1:46:32] effect on us it's got to bring us if we
[1:46:36] claim to believe it amen then let's
[1:46:38] believe it amen if we believe it it
[1:46:40] should bring us into an action amen amen
[1:46:43] don't think I'm condemning anybody I'm
[1:46:45] condemning
[1:46:46] myself we all live life we all get busy
[1:46:49] but let's come back to our first love
[1:46:51] amen let's go back to the realization of
[1:46:54] what we believe what we've claimed to
[1:46:55] believe and what we claim to believe it
[1:46:57] should affect everything about our lives
[1:46:59] it should affect the way we think it
[1:47:01] should affect the way we we talk it
[1:47:03] should affect our fellowship it should
[1:47:05] affect where we go it should affect what
[1:47:06] we do it should affect what we allow on
[1:47:08] our mind it should all be affected by
[1:47:10] what we
[1:47:12] believe the devil is constantly trying
[1:47:14] to pressure us and pressure us and
[1:47:16] pressure us and get us away from the
[1:47:18] very thing that brings
[1:47:20] life but oh God help me never be like a
[1:47:23] Rich Young Ruler let me be like zakus as
[1:47:26] rotten and stinking scoundrel as he was
[1:47:28] when he came in contact with Christ he
[1:47:30] was ready to give everything up for
[1:47:32] Christ that's what I want to
[1:47:37] be the Bible tells us that Nicodemus
[1:47:39] came to Jesus by night brother BR talks
[1:47:42] about this he said don't condemn
[1:47:43] Nicodemus at least he made it that's
[1:47:46] what brother says it over and over it's
[1:47:47] easy to condemn Nicodemus but don't
[1:47:49] condemn him at least he made an effort
[1:47:51] yeah he was afraid of his friends and he
[1:47:53] was afraid of of rejection and all of
[1:47:55] that but but so Nicodemus was a secret
[1:47:57] believer but when Nicodemus comes to
[1:47:59] Jesus by night he says Jesus we all know
[1:48:02] that thou are a
[1:48:04] teacher who is all of us yeah thou are a
[1:48:08] teacher sent from God for no man can do
[1:48:09] the things that thou doest unless God be
[1:48:11] with him he's testifying for the whole
[1:48:14] Sanhedrin yeah we all listen it's
[1:48:18] obvious we all know that you're a
[1:48:20] teacher sent from God
[1:48:23] well if they all could see he was a
[1:48:25] teacher sent from God why didn't they do
[1:48:27] what he
[1:48:31] said they wanted to kill
[1:48:34] him you're a teacher comes from God like
[1:48:37] like okay it's obvious we get it we can
[1:48:39] see Miracles and we can't deny death and
[1:48:41] we can't deny this and that okay you're
[1:48:42] a teacher from God but we don't like
[1:48:44] what you
[1:48:45] teach
[1:48:48] right wait a second you said you're you
[1:48:51] call him a teacher that came from
[1:48:55] God but I don't like what you teach well
[1:48:58] what does that mean this is a teacher
[1:49:00] sent from God if I don't like what the
[1:49:03] teacher sent from God teaches then I
[1:49:05] don't like what God's
[1:49:07] teaching right no wonder or sin
[1:49:13] remains
[1:49:16] amen so Nicodemus comes and
[1:49:20] testifies we all believe you're a
[1:49:22] teacher for from God but their actions
[1:49:24] proved they didn't believe it they
[1:49:25] believed it intellectually of course 1+
[1:49:28] 1 equals 2 okay you do all these
[1:49:30] Miracles and all these things you've got
[1:49:32] to come from God but the real Faith down
[1:49:34] on the inside they did not have it
[1:49:37] because if they did they would come to
[1:49:38] him differently they would have listened
[1:49:40] to what he
[1:49:41] said but Jesus one day goes by
[1:49:45] Samaria to a little well side because
[1:49:48] there's an appointment there a
[1:49:49] predestinated appointment that was Saul
[1:49:52] got Mind Of God before the foundation of
[1:49:54] the world and there's a little Harlot
[1:49:56] woman living an unclean life she's as
[1:49:58] bad off as zakus
[1:50:00] was she's had five husbands the one
[1:50:03] she's living with now is not her own
[1:50:04] husband she's been in marriage and
[1:50:06] divorce and marriage and relationship
[1:50:07] after relationship and she's nobody
[1:50:10] nobody calls a Believer nobody goes to
[1:50:12] her for information nobody asks her what
[1:50:14] God's thinking or says nobody wants her
[1:50:16] opinion on the
[1:50:18] subject is that right Jesus comes and
[1:50:21] starts Discerning her life under the
[1:50:23] discernment the same thing all the
[1:50:24] Pharisees saw the same thing every
[1:50:27] religious leader in Jerusalem witnessed
[1:50:29] with their own eyes he begins to do for
[1:50:31] her to discern her life and she begins
[1:50:33] to say ah I perceive you to be a prophet
[1:50:36] I've got questions about serving God
[1:50:39] yeah where do those questions come from
[1:50:41] there was something down inside of her
[1:50:43] was just waiting for a teacher to come
[1:50:45] from God somebody that she could get the
[1:50:48] answer to her question and what was her
[1:50:50] question how do I worship God how does
[1:50:52] God want to to be worshiped I'm taught
[1:50:53] by my ancestors on this Mount you Jews
[1:50:55] say on Jerusalem and Jesus says listen
[1:50:57] neither here nor there but the day is
[1:51:00] coming when God seeketh those to worship
[1:51:03] Him in spirit and
[1:51:05] truth and the woman steps back she's not
[1:51:07] witnessing anything different than the
[1:51:09] Pharisees
[1:51:11] witnessed she steps
[1:51:14] back she goes we know that when Messiah
[1:51:18] comes he'll teach us these things
[1:51:23] and Jesus says I that speaketh it to you
[1:51:25] am
[1:51:31] he Nicodemus says we all believe there a
[1:51:35] teacher sent from God but he snuck in
[1:51:37] there at night yeah because of his
[1:51:42] friends this little woman was no good
[1:51:44] rejected nobody wanted her an outcast in
[1:51:49] society and when she come in contact
[1:51:51] with the living world for her day says
[1:51:54] she dropped her water pot she left her
[1:51:56] water pot and went running into the City
[1:51:59] and said see comes see a man who told me
[1:52:02] everything that is not this the very
[1:52:04] Messiah this isn't a secret believer
[1:52:07] she's not coming at night she's not
[1:52:09] hiding out from the opinion of everybody
[1:52:11] else she
[1:52:13] believed she came in contact with the
[1:52:16] Living God for her day and she believed
[1:52:18] it so much she didn't care what anybody
[1:52:20] thought they didn't think much of her
[1:52:21] anyways I'll tell you friends it's
[1:52:23] really good to go ahead and let your
[1:52:24] reputation get ruined from day one it's
[1:52:26] so much
[1:52:29] easier she didn't care there was a big
[1:52:32] difference between her and Nicodemus and
[1:52:34] her and the whole Sanhedrin
[1:52:36] counsel because you say you believe your
[1:52:39] sin remains we believe you're a teacher
[1:52:42] from God then your sin
[1:52:46] remains said they couldn't accept it
[1:52:48] because of their tradition but that
[1:52:51] little woman could accept it because
[1:52:53] brother B said she had a predestinated
[1:52:55] seat of Life inside of her said why
[1:52:57] couldn't the Pharisees they seen the
[1:52:59] same thing they heard the same thing why
[1:53:00] couldn't they accept it he says because
[1:53:01] they had no representation in heaven but
[1:53:03] she had representation in heaven she was
[1:53:06] a SE genene she brother said she was a
[1:53:08] thought that had fallen from the mind of
[1:53:11] God and when she came in contact with
[1:53:13] God it
[1:53:15] manifest not with words but her whole
[1:53:19] life
[1:53:21] changed brother B makes this statement
[1:53:24] I'm going to finish with this quote out
[1:53:25] do is your life worthy of the
[1:53:27] gospel and it's quote when I read it had
[1:53:30] huge impact on me and I didn't I didn't
[1:53:32] dive into it much when we went through
[1:53:34] the to the tape because I I wanted to
[1:53:36] save it for
[1:53:39] this but it
[1:53:41] was so interesting he
[1:53:44] says when God sends the Holy Ghost and
[1:53:47] knocks at a man's door and he
[1:53:49] deliberately turns it down sometimes
[1:53:51] he's going to turn it down for the last
[1:53:52] time and when you won't be a and then
[1:53:55] you won't be a privileged character you
[1:53:57] can sit in a church and listen to the
[1:53:59] gospel and agree with the gospel you
[1:54:01] might do so much to say I know it's
[1:54:02] right but never put a finger on it to
[1:54:05] help it yourself see you just listen to
[1:54:08] it because you say I believe it's right
[1:54:10] that's just sympathizing with
[1:54:12] it I could say I believe that's a
[1:54:15] $10,000 that don't mean I got
[1:54:18] it I could say that's good cold water
[1:54:21] but refuse to drink it you know what I
[1:54:23] mean and this is eternal life and to
[1:54:27] refuse to do it one day you'll cross the
[1:54:29] line between judgment and mercy and then
[1:54:31] you won't have a privilege to come and
[1:54:34] receive it now this is the statement I
[1:54:37] want you to think
[1:54:38] about to you people who come here I'm
[1:54:40] not responsible for those or other
[1:54:42] ministers speaking to but if it's right
[1:54:45] you owe your life to
[1:54:48] it what more could you ever find that
[1:54:50] would be more of a benefit to you than
[1:54:52] and to know that you can have eternal
[1:54:55] life then listen to this what if I was
[1:54:59] given away capsules here that
[1:55:00] scientifically proven scientifically
[1:55:02] proven that this capsule would make you
[1:55:04] live a thousand years well I'd have to
[1:55:07] get a militia out here and swarm them
[1:55:09] away from the place you wouldn't have to
[1:55:11] make an altar call for it you just have
[1:55:13] to beat them away from it to live a
[1:55:15] thousand
[1:55:16] years that little word picture did a lot
[1:55:18] for me
[1:55:20] friends what if we had a he said what
[1:55:22] have I had a little capsule
[1:55:24] scientifically proven without a shadow
[1:55:25] of a doubt you can take this and live a
[1:55:27] thousand years listen the church would
[1:55:29] be
[1:55:30] full the deacons would have their hands
[1:55:33] full trying to keep down the crowd try
[1:55:36] they'd have to lock the doors because
[1:55:37] too many people would press in amen and
[1:55:40] and and if there was an offer come and
[1:55:42] get them Hey listen you don't have to
[1:55:43] make an altar call you don't have to say
[1:55:45] listen your mama's in heaven don't you
[1:55:47] want to see Mama one day and and this
[1:55:49] and that listen all you got to do is say
[1:55:51] come and get it and there would be
[1:55:52] Stampede down to the front to get them
[1:55:54] why because people want their own
[1:56:05] life think about it
[1:56:07] friends what God is offering us is
[1:56:11] eternal
[1:56:13] life what God is offering is
[1:56:17] himself you know we'll go to work on
[1:56:20] time because if you if you're too late
[1:56:22] to work too many times you might get a
[1:56:24] dearit and you won't get a raise next
[1:56:25] time and so we'll go and we'll do extra
[1:56:27] work to get a raise but we'll be late
[1:56:30] every Sunday for
[1:56:32] church but on time for work because if
[1:56:34] I'm on time for work I can get I can
[1:56:36] gain
[1:56:37] something what's more
[1:56:42] valuable spend all of our time and all
[1:56:44] of our energy pursuing things that have
[1:56:47] no Eternal
[1:56:49] value but what has more value friend
[1:56:54] friends we we treat the things of God as
[1:56:58] if they'll always be there and we can
[1:57:01] take them or we can leave them my church
[1:57:04] intendance doesn't really matter whether
[1:57:06] I'm early or not doesn't matter but the
[1:57:08] prophet said it
[1:57:09] matters the word of God says it
[1:57:12] matters our devotion our daily reading
[1:57:15] the time we spend in the word our prayer
[1:57:17] time all of that twitters away so that
[1:57:20] we can
[1:57:22] buy and sell and build and have Hey
[1:57:26] listen we got to buy and sell and build
[1:57:28] and have there's no way to get away from
[1:57:31] it but if we truly
[1:57:34] believed what God has given us I think
[1:57:37] it'll affect our
[1:57:39] lives I think if we really if we really
[1:57:43] believed if you really believe that this
[1:57:45] is your home church and that God is
[1:57:47] going to feed you from this Pulpit
[1:57:49] spiritual food for spiritual growth
[1:57:51] you'll be here
[1:57:53] amen you'll be early to pray that that
[1:57:56] poor man who's just a broken vessel will
[1:57:58] surrender so God will speak to
[1:58:01] me if we believe
[1:58:04] it if we don't then our actions will
[1:58:07] prove what we
[1:58:09] believe if we believe this is where God
[1:58:11] placed me this is the ministry I sit
[1:58:13] under this is the message of the hour
[1:58:15] this is the word of of life then if we
[1:58:18] really believe that that faith will have
[1:58:21] an effect on our Liv lives amen and the
[1:58:24] manifestation that comes out from us
[1:58:26] will manifest what we
[1:58:28] believe so Jesus says you say you love
[1:58:32] me you love me you love me it's easy to
[1:58:35] say you love me but if you love me keep
[1:58:38] my
[1:58:41] Commandments you love me you love me
[1:58:43] there's all kinds of songs all over the
[1:58:45] world in christiandom about loving Jesus
[1:58:48] yeah how much they love Jesus and Jesus
[1:58:50] is all their love
[1:58:52] and won't do the simple things he says
[1:58:54] in the Bible he said if you love me keep
[1:58:58] my
[1:58:59] Commandments listen if we say we
[1:59:02] see then our sin
[1:59:05] remains so you know what I want to say
[1:59:08] God helped me to see the right thing
[1:59:10] Amen brother B said brother B said
[1:59:14] you're not getting it you don't see it
[1:59:15] like you should he said frankly I don't
[1:59:17] see it like I
[1:59:18] should you know what I think I think
[1:59:21] we're not seeing it like we
[1:59:23] should I'm praying God makes it more
[1:59:25] real to us friends more Vivid more
[1:59:28] personal more in my heart that God that
[1:59:32] I can say what I believe amen comes into
[1:59:35] a life because not because I have to
[1:59:38] live it but because I believe it it
[1:59:40] automatically becomes life see friends
[1:59:43] this is a natural thing this isn't a
[1:59:45] this isn't fake this isn't put on this
[1:59:47] isn't a crow putting peacock feathers in
[1:59:50] that won't work it's it's actually a
[1:59:52] growth that comes from the inside a life
[1:59:54] of faith that starts to push everything
[1:59:56] else out and it starts to manifest the
[1:59:58] life that's on the inside a sheep is not
[2:00:00] man as a manufacturer wool a sheep Bears
[2:00:04] wool what does God asked us to do
[2:00:07] believe him just believe him surrender
[2:00:11] if we call him Lord let him be
[2:00:15] Lord if we love him obey
[2:00:18] him let our lives testify of what we
[2:00:21] actually
[2:00:24] believe and the reality is we all have
[2:00:26] struggles we all have backslidings we
[2:00:29] all have coolings offs we have warming
[2:00:31] UPS we have revivals in our own life we
[2:00:33] have fresh outpourings of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:35] but friend if you find yourself in that
[2:00:37] situation where you're cooling off and
[2:00:38] you need a fresh outpouring of the Holy
[2:00:40] Ghost cry out for it amen if we find
[2:00:42] ourselves getting laxed and lethargic
[2:00:44] about the things of God and pulling back
[2:00:46] from the things that are the most
[2:00:47] meaningful things that have ever struck
[2:00:49] this Earth and we find us a taking a
[2:00:52] shot attitude but God forgive me and
[2:00:54] fill me again with your spirit God give
[2:00:55] me a fresh outpouring I need to come in
[2:00:58] contact with you
[2:01:00] again don't be ashamed to cry out for it
[2:01:03] don't don't just go on in lethargy don't
[2:01:05] just go on like the Rich Young Ruler
[2:01:06] acting like oh great good Master but
[2:01:09] when the requirement is more than I want
[2:01:11] to give I walk away from the good master
[2:01:13] I just kneel at no let me come back and
[2:01:15] say good Master please help me amen
[2:01:17] that's that that I'm having a hard time
[2:01:20] I'm struggling with the request but God
[2:01:22] I believe it's true help my
[2:01:25] unbelief be real be genuine be honest be
[2:01:29] 100% be on fire no halfway no
[2:01:35] 50% this message is Jesus Christ right
[2:01:39] amen do we say that amen right if we
[2:01:43] said it we just made ourselves
[2:01:45] responsible to
[2:01:48] amen if we said that this message is
[2:01:51] Jesus
[2:01:52] Christ then by our own mouth we've made
[2:01:56] ourselves
[2:01:57] subject to this message in this
[2:02:01] day why because he's
[2:02:04] Lord and I want to say Lord
[2:02:07] Lord but the real lord lord from my
[2:02:10] heart be my Lord my Lord be my king be
[2:02:16] my God be my guide be everything to me
[2:02:20] God forgive me for getting distracted
[2:02:22] with things of the world forgive me for
[2:02:24] getting tangled up and tied
[2:02:26] up you know God is so good to us friends
[2:02:30] that he'll allow Calamity to come into
[2:02:32] our lives so that we have no place to go
[2:02:35] but back to
[2:02:36] him he knows what human flesh is like
[2:02:39] and what the Temptations and struggles
[2:02:41] of Life are like and he knows listen
[2:02:43] friends he understands but God will
[2:02:46] allow things to come in our life
[2:02:48] barriers and and hardship and
[2:02:50] difficulties in our own personal family
[2:02:51] failures and all of these so that we can
[2:02:53] get back to what's
[2:02:56] important back to what listen when I
[2:03:00] first came to this message nothing else
[2:03:02] in this world mattered to
[2:03:04] me my other relationships fell away
[2:03:07] family strained everything went sideways
[2:03:10] and upside down and backwards but it
[2:03:12] didn't matter to me I didn't care if I
[2:03:13] had a job or didn't have a job I had the
[2:03:16] truth God let me stay with my first love
[2:03:20] help me not to cool off that was what
[2:03:22] happened to Ephesus let there be there
[2:03:24] let there not be an Ephesian cooling off
[2:03:26] in US
[2:03:28] am listen we've all every one of us who
[2:03:32] served God for a while we've made great
[2:03:34] sacrifices to be where the word is some
[2:03:37] of you have sold out and moved cross
[2:03:38] country sold your houses gave up maybe
[2:03:41] good jobs maybe took a loss on your home
[2:03:44] had to come to Lima amen maybe left a
[2:03:46] beautiful place and came to
[2:03:48] a beautiful place
[2:03:55] gave up relationships gave up status
[2:03:57] gave up friends gave up the church you
[2:03:59] grew up and gave up the traditional
[2:04:01] teaching of your parents how how many of
[2:04:03] us when we first come to this we gave up
[2:04:05] everything and we lost everything we
[2:04:07] lost our reputation amongst our friends
[2:04:08] we lost our friends we lost contact with
[2:04:10] family we lost everything and we were
[2:04:16] happy why because we were like zakus
[2:04:22] we were we come in contact with a living
[2:04:24] God we were like the woman at the well
[2:04:26] we come in contact with the Living God
[2:04:28] and we were it didn't matter
[2:04:32] anymore say God let that Faith still
[2:04:35] have an effect in my
[2:04:37] life you who moved me from the place I
[2:04:40] grew up all my life from the area where
[2:04:42] I had Root Down you pucked me up and
[2:04:44] moved me amen why because I wanted the
[2:04:47] word more than I wanted family I wanted
[2:04:49] the word more than I wanted my job I
[2:04:51] wanted the word more than I wanted
[2:04:52] anything else I say God I still want the
[2:04:55] word more than anything else help me
[2:04:57] God help me
[2:05:00] God what a shame to pluck up and move
[2:05:03] what a shame to sell out and to find
[2:05:06] ourselves embroided and Tangled in the
[2:05:08] world again and going cool and slow when
[2:05:10] we were red hot and on fire CU it was
[2:05:13] everything to
[2:05:14] us let's go back and say God I love
[2:05:19] you I really love you you and I really
[2:05:23] want you to be Lord in my life this
[2:05:26] Faith that's inside of me is calling out
[2:05:30] for Action obedience
[2:05:33] surrender remember
[2:05:35] the Bible tells us what what God
[2:05:39] wants he said do I take more pleasure in
[2:05:42] burnt offerings or in
[2:05:45] obedience burnt offerings looks good and
[2:05:48] says we love God and we're giving him
[2:05:51] but really obedience is really a
[2:05:53] surrender to God and giving to him and I
[2:05:56] say
[2:05:57] God bring me back to my first
[2:06:01] love am and let's all stand
[2:06:09] together I wonder what church would be
[2:06:12] like if everybody who came got a raffle
[2:06:15] ticket and at the end of service we gave
[2:06:18] away a solid gold bar
[2:06:26] you wouldn't miss church because you
[2:06:27] have a scratchy
[2:06:31] throat but if we had a capsule that
[2:06:34] could prove you could live A Thousand
[2:06:37] Years listen friends don't get in your
[2:06:39] mind that I care anything about church
[2:06:41] attendance I'm trying to get people to
[2:06:43] come to church I'm just pointing out
[2:06:46] what happens in our life amen if we're
[2:06:49] not diligent and faithful and stay with
[2:06:51] the word
[2:06:52] God help us don't ever let us get to the
[2:06:55] place where I I believe this message but
[2:06:58] then when our life it's like
[2:07:01] really do we believe the
[2:07:04] message is it true but I wanted to be
[2:07:08] like zakus everybody knew something
[2:07:10] happened to that
[2:07:11] man I wanted to be like the woman at the
[2:07:13] well everybody knew something happened
[2:07:15] to that I don't want people looking at
[2:07:17] me and say well I think they believe I'm
[2:07:18] not sure please God help me not to live
[2:07:21] like that amen listen friends we need
[2:07:24] God we need the life of God we need the
[2:07:26] spirit of God if we receive the word of
[2:07:28] God by receiving the word of God we open
[2:07:30] ourselves to the life of the word and
[2:07:32] let the life of the word come in and
[2:07:33] live the life of the word brother bam
[2:07:36] told us with Samson that God can only
[2:07:39] use Samson's strength because he
[2:07:40] couldn't get to Samson's heart and
[2:07:41] brother Benham said God can only use
[2:07:44] what we surrendered to
[2:07:46] him and the Rich Young Ruler wasn't
[2:07:49] willing to surrender all but zakus was
[2:07:51] and I say God give me a heart to like
[2:07:53] zakus give me a heart like the woman at
[2:07:55] the well give me a heart amen like your
[2:07:58] Apostles amen who dropped their Nets and
[2:08:00] followed
[2:08:01] you give me that kind of Heart Lord let
[2:08:05] that be the faith that's expressed in me

[2:08:11] hope you know I love
[2:08:13] you amen these things are real
[2:08:17] friends these things are the things that
[2:08:19] we face and deal with and we've got to
[2:08:20] be honest
[2:08:23] we've got to we got to we got to go back
[2:08:25] and say why was I willing to lose
[2:08:28] everything but now I can't give up some
[2:08:32] sleep or some time or even hurt
[2:08:37] feelings listen before I didn't care who
[2:08:40] hurt my feelings I was going to come
[2:08:43] hear the
[2:08:44] word

[2:10:34] here for you yes we're not here for the
[2:10:38] singing and the
[2:10:40] socialization God if we've come for that
[2:10:42] forgive us we're not here just because
[2:10:45] our friends are here we're not here
[2:10:48] because it's comfortable
[2:10:51] but Lord we're here because we love you
[2:10:55] we want to serve you your Prophet told
[2:10:58] us we don't come to church to see our
[2:11:00] good places we come to find our bad
[2:11:02] places we come to find the place where
[2:11:05] we need to
[2:11:06] grow and God I found places in me that
[2:11:09] need to
[2:11:11] grow God I
[2:11:13] Repent I'm sorry Lord for the laziness
[2:11:18] the
[2:11:19] lethargy Lord you know my heart and how
[2:11:22] I get Bound in my mind with troubles and
[2:11:25] discouragement and I let it get to me
[2:11:27] Lord and I pull back and I nurse that
[2:11:31] discouragement until it keeps me from
[2:11:34] joyfully loving your word for my first
[2:11:38] love and my passion and desire for
[2:11:40] nothing but your
[2:11:42] truth God if there's anybody else Lord
[2:11:46] that falls into that condition from time
[2:11:48] to time I
[2:11:49] pray God that you would bring bring a
[2:11:51] fresh outpouring of your
[2:11:53] spirit may you sweep through us now and
[2:11:56] burn out Lord all the things that are
[2:12:00] hindering us
[2:12:01] Lord May no Little Creeper vine get a
[2:12:04] hold of us and pull our plant down May
[2:12:07] no troubles or
[2:12:09] cares opportunities or blessings May
[2:12:12] none of it Lord get in our
[2:12:14] way for God there was a time for each of
[2:12:17] us where nothing else mattered but you
[2:12:19] and that's still what we believe
[2:12:21] that's still in my heart that's still in
[2:12:23] the heart of your
[2:12:24] children but God I
[2:12:27] pray I pray Lord that it wouldn't be
[2:12:31] that the greatest response would be if
[2:12:33] we had tablets that could make us live a
[2:12:35] thousand
[2:12:37] years that that would move us and that
[2:12:39] would bring a crowd and that would cause
[2:12:42] a great Revival and
[2:12:45] rejoicing for God you've already given
[2:12:47] us eternal
[2:12:48] life you've already given us your
[2:12:51] perfect word you've already given us the
[2:12:53] truth the reality how could anything be
[2:12:57] more
[2:12:58] attractive how could anything be more
[2:13:00] desirable how could anything have
[2:13:02] greater
[2:13:03] value God I pray you help us
[2:13:06] Lord may it not
[2:13:09] be
[2:13:11] that we have to have something special
[2:13:14] to get a response may it be just your
[2:13:16] lovely
[2:13:17] word that we love so much
[2:13:21] may we not ever have to move to programs
[2:13:23] or entertainment to keep a
[2:13:26] crown cause people to want to come may
[2:13:28] it not be because what we do and
[2:13:31] Showmanship and
[2:13:32] workup but God gather us as your people
[2:13:35] that love your word that love you and
[2:13:38] you only that are not here for each
[2:13:41] other that are not serving you because
[2:13:43] of friendships because of
[2:13:47] relationships because of
[2:13:49] gain but we're here because we love you
[2:13:53] because you revealed yourself to us
[2:13:55] because you are worthy of our praise and
[2:13:58] we love you so
[2:13:59] much God may we make a fresh
[2:14:01] consecration of our lives and surrender
[2:14:03] all over
[2:14:05] again for God we need more of
[2:14:09] you you have no hands but our hands no
[2:14:13] mouth but our mouth no eyes but our
[2:14:16] eyes God you you choose to work through
[2:14:19] us but God you have to have a vessel
[2:14:21] that will surrender to you and will
[2:14:24] empty
[2:14:25] out Lord Jesus I want to empty out right
[2:14:29] now Lord let your children right in
[2:14:31] their seats right now empty
[2:14:34] out God I pray you'd bring to their mind
[2:14:37] anything that's getting in the way
[2:14:40] whether it's work
[2:14:42] relationship
[2:14:44] discouragement whatever it is Lord
[2:14:47] that's starting to drag us down I pray
