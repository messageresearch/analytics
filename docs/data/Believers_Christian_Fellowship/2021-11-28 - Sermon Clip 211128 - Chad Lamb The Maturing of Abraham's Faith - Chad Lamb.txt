TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i'm so thankful for the account in hebrews because the account in hebrews to me is the heavenly account when you just read hebrews and you don't read genesis you're like abraham was a great man by faith he left this land by faith he did this by faith and he was looking for a city all of those things are 100 true by faith he left his home by faith he's so drowned in a strange land by faith amen but the bible's not listing that he didn't fully obey because he took lot along he didn't fully obey because of his father he didn't he didn't fully obey because he left the land it's only looking at what abraham believed and abraham believed the promise even if his actions were missteps even if for a little bit he stepped to the right god will bring him back he stepped to the left god will bring him back but the heavenly record only looks at what abraham believed and all along abraham believed the word of god he believed what god said he believed the promise of god he did obey he did walk amen when where he was lacking god was working out the details i hope that there's just a heavenly account of my life and says he believed the message of the hour he stood fast with the word of god he believed what the prophet said amen because i can look back on my life and say i believed but i still did that i believed but i allowed that compromise i believe but i still went along with this even though i knew it wasn't right amen i want all those things erased from my records i want a hebrew account of my life amen that says he believed the message when he heard it he believed it he walked out of his denomination and he walked into the promise of god and he believed the message and left us home and left all of this and left relationships that's the heavenly account the reality was i prayed tears full in my pillow saying god please don't let me be rejected by my family god if i could stay here and win them over god if i could just stay in the church and change the church the earthly account and the heavenly account are looking at two different pictures the earthly account is looking at my actions the heavenly accounts looking at my faith
