among us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you all good evening it's good to be here together while we're standing let's grab our Bibles and let's read a scripture before we're seated we want to read out of Proverbs chapter 18 while you're turning there I just want to remind you that brother Vitali and his family will be coming in this weekend they actually arrive uh in Columbus tomorrow evening so we'll be picking them up there and uh they'll be taking the Sunday morning service here and then the afternoon service for the Youth so we're looking forward to having him here for that also I want to remind you that Brother Kyle wer will be leaving Friday he'll be flying out to Oregon for services there brother richc and he'll be coming back I think Monday or Tuesday so just be praying for him and brother Wesley will be with him and also don't forget brother Emanuel he's still gone still be gone for another two weeks I believe so remember keep him in prayer he sent me a text let me know that he had one day he wasn't feeling too well but the Lord took care of him and he's feeling much better so just pray for our brother to have strength amen doing a lot of ministering a lot of interpreting a lot of traveling and it has a way of wearing you down so just pray that he'll stay strong amen let's look together here at Proverbs 18:24 proverbs 18: 24 a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother and God bless you as you have your seats amen it's a little bit of an odd scripture to take but God dropped this thought in my heart and I haven't been able to get away from it and the only way to get away from it is to preach it amen and there's a scripture that I read that's going to be the main thrust that I want to launch off of out of 2 Samuel we can go ahead and turn to 2 Samuel chap 10 but I I just want to share with you that um oh it's probably been a couple months ago I read through this and it just struck me every once in a while you read something out of the scripture that strikes you and and for me I know that there's a sermon there I know there's something there that's drawing my attention but I don't know yet how it'll materialize so that was a few months ago and then just over the last several weeks it began to materialize in my heart and so now I just want to share it with you but I want to take for a title Don't Make Friends into enemies Don't Make Friends into enemies and for a subtitle I want to put uh preserving relationships so don't make friends into enemies and preserving relationships amen and that's why I was just dwelling on this because this is not not my usual mode of operation but God dropped it in my heart so solid I knew what to minister amen so we're going to go down this line once we read 2 Samuel begin to see what we're referring to 2 Samuel 10:1 and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of Aman died and hanun his son reigned in his stead then said David I will show kindness unto hanun the son of nahash as his father showed kindness unto me and David sent Comfort sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and David's servants came into the land of the children of Aman and the princes of the children of Aman said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father that he ha sent comforters unto thee hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it wherefore hanon took David's servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away when they told it unto David he sent to them he he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the King said Terry at Jericho unto your beards be grown and then return amen so like I said I was just reading this through my daily my daily reading my daily Bible reading and it struck me and I knew there was something here so I I started thinking about it meditating on it and it just came back and you begin to realize that that there's a great lesson here it's a simple lesson but it's a great lesson here David wants to show kindness David is going to show himself a friend to this neighboring country to the country of Aman and because this man's father showed kindness to David David's going to show kindness to him and sends an ambassage sends some ambassadors that way to comfort him for his father and his extension of friendship amen but they were suspicious of David They didn't accept him as a friend they were suspicious and and the princes of that country began to speak to the king and made him misunderstand David's act of kindness made him misunderstand it uh made him suspicious amen and all of a sudden uh the fear began to creep in that David wasn't genuine this is not a genuine show of friendship and now because fear Creeps in this old self Rises up and now there's an act of self-preservation that's going to take place based off suspicion based off all of these things and all of it is a mirage all of it's false all of it's fake David is being genuine so what he does is he he shames the ambassadors and he sends them away ashamed and they're greatly ashamed and what he did was a terrible defense to the men and David uh uh David then tells them the way that Jericho and then The Story Goes On we won't read all of it but the story goes on and when they realize that they had offended David then they call up the syrians because they know David's going to fight so now they call for enemies and they're starting a battle before a battle started David come as a friend and they didn't accept him as a friend but saw him as an enemy but he was coming as a a friend that's why I said Don't Make Friends into enemies David would have been the best friend they ever had David was a man after God's Own Heart he was a mighty king and a mighty warrior if they would have received his friendship if they would have acknowledged his friend and they would have been friendly unto him he would have been the best friend they ever had but because they were suspicious amen because they had Pride because they had fear fear and pride brought out self-preservation and brought out suspicion and brought out all of this out of their out of their hearts amen and they did the very wrong thing and then after they realized they had greatly offended David now instead of repenting and making it right they go and get syrians to come and become an army to stand with them and when David finds out they've called on the syrians Denny sends joab in the battle there's a great battle and it eventually ends with Aman being destroyed the king losing his kingdom them taking the crown and putting it on David's head and none of it needed to happen right all because they didn't receive a friend as a friend but they allowed the devil to interpret his friendship as an enemy oh man what a lesson friends like I said this is simple amen don't wait me to for me to get to the punchline you've already got it it's so simple you can read it and understand how many times have we done the same thing amen all the time we take a notion from a friend or or we take a compliment and we can take a compliment through the devil interpretation and we can turn a compliment into a suspicious statement what do they mean by that statement why did they say it that way why did he say it why did they say it with that tone and all of a sudden we begin to become suspicious of our friends I say God help us help us everyone amen we find that in the Bible friendship is a very important theme very important Jesus was the greatest friend the disciples ever had he called them his friend friendship shows up from the beginning to the end we find David and Jonathan were friends bosom friends so much friends that the love for one another was greater than a love for a man for a woman amen and they stuck with one another they defended one another they protected and trusted one another friendship is a tremendous theme in the Bible and here we find a case of friendship turned they made they made an enemy out of David when it didn't need to be that way and I think that most of the time the things that happen to us don't need to happen the way they do we we many times turns brothers and sisters into enemies has that ever happened to you by being suspicious why did they do that why didn't they include me in this why did they make that statement why did they go there why last time they called me this time they didn't call me yeah I was invited there last time but I'm not invited there this time brother I said it's simple I mean we're we're so Fallen as human beings it's embarrassing it's shameful sometimes I just look to God and I said God I'm ashamed of being in this hybrid flesh I'm ashamed of where my mind goes I'm ashamed of where my emotions go I sometimes ashamed of myself I tell you what's so tragic Sometimes the best friend you have in the whole world your spouse the devil will make you suspicious of your spouse you'll be suspicious of their motives why did they say that and why why when I said this they said that and why when I asked them to do this they didn't do that what's the devil trying to do is trying to come down and make enemies about out of the best friend you have in the whole world which is your spouse and and we all know what that's like amen the enemy is constantly trying to find a way in to break friendship to break relationship ship that's why the that's why the subtitle is preserving relationships and we're going to get into that but the devil will make us make us suspicious and that suspicion always comes from fear and pride fear and pride and we're going to find out that the best way to stay a friend and the best way to preserve a relationship is we've got to die out to ourselves and stop this notion of self-preservation stop this notion of protecting ourselves and having to prevent harm from coming to us amen the only way to be a true friend amen the only way to preserve a relationship is to become absolutely vulnerable and open to total Destruction amen from the ones you love amen say is that right brother Chad that's what Jesus did yes sir that's what Jesus did let's look at this in John chapter 6 I'm finding more and more as God begins to deal deeper and deeper in my own heart I feel I find more and more that uh all of my problems come from myself that it's not always what happens around me it's how I interpret what's happening around me and many times I have a false interpretation of what's happening and the false interpretation is coming out of self-love amen coming out of Pride amen and and and and a fear that I'm going to lose something I'm going to lose a friend I'm going to lose status I'm going to lose reputation and then all of a sudden I go into counter measures to try to counteract the loss of a reputation or the loss of friendship or a loss of status amen and when I do that I moved into self-preservation but now in order to preserve myself it causes me to go on a counter offensive amen and all the a sudden you can have War break out amen and sometimes it's not open conflict sometimes it's cold war it's a silent War it's an estrangement from friends and you become distant and become cold amen and the the Cold War enters in all because amen of old rotten dirty stinking self and that Old Pride that was injected at the fall amen that we all have to deal with amen that's Lucifer's Pride this comes straight from this comes straight from Lucifer got injected into Humanity through the fall and we're all struggling with it but what we need is a good healthy dose of dying to self and like one brother told me he says sometimes you don't even know what you're supposed to die from yes I mean you want to die to yourself so I died to myself when I come to the message and I threw my shorts away and I cut the cable to the TV and and I died to myself cuz I love TV and I mean I was raised the latchy kid I watched four to 6 hours of TV every day of my life I mean I loved it I I watched it I watched it when I didn't want to watch it I watched it when I was tired of watching it but I watched it anyways so when I cut it out I was dying to self when I cut some old places and I surrendered amen but you realize that this dying out to self amen it's not going to be that simple it goes a whole lot deeper than that and so we we begin to find that brother B said the greatest enemy I got is William brandham well I'm telling you the greatest enemy I got is Chad Lamb this old hybrid flesh with this carnal spirit amen and this this notion of I have to protect myself and I I've got to drop that notion if I'm ever going to get anywhere in the kingdom of God if I'm going to be like Christ I have to drop self-preservation I got to get rid of it I got to stop all this suspicious you know what I'm talking about cuz you're a human being the very ones you love the most sometimes family members become suspicious of one another why did they do that and why did they say that and you know they they got in the fridge and they ate the last piece of cake and they knew that I wanted it they just did that to spite me and then all of a sudden it builds up a wall yes and then we go into Cold War and it sounds funny but that's the harmless end of it but you take that a couple other notches into a brother and sister or to family members or to spouses you you extend it from one Church to another and all of a sudden you got open Cold War for no reason whatsoever other than the war that's going on in our mind trying to preserve ourselves and our reputation and not to allow ourselves to get hurt but is not the example Jesus Christ gave us and it's not the example the prophet in this age gave us if we go to John chapter 6 and look at verse 70 we're going to look at the relationship between Jesus and Judas for a moment and Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spoke of Judas a scariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the 12 I want you to look where we're at in the Book of John we're in John chapter six all the way in the beginning we're in the earlier parts of Jesus's Ministry we haven't even come to the end yet and he already knows that one of the ones that he's chosen is a devil and he knows it's judas's scariot Amen John John discloses that here in the Bible amen but you never find anywhere where Jesus discredits Judas as a friend he calls him friend in fact Jesus knows what's in the heart of Judas and he knows that he's a thief he knows he has the heart of the thief so what does Jesus do to Judas he gives him the bag of money because he know knows in his heart is a thief and he knows he's the one to betray betray him but you know if it was me and I knew if I knew one of you would betray me amen I'm going to tell you it's going to take a whole lot of Grace for me to be as good to you as Jesus was to Judas I'm just being honest I just I need to grow I need more of the spirit of God to take over and I need less of me because if I know if I know from the beginning in our relationship that a few years down the road amen one of you are going to betray me and it's going to cause separation from the disciples I love it's going to cause a painful death it's going to cause all of that it's going to be very difficult for me to maintain the kind of friendship for you that Jesus maintained for Judas but the question is are we going to be like Jesus or not amen Jesus never came to the Earth to preserve his life right you know when we really get a revelation of who we are like genuinely catch a revelation of who we are in the reality you know not the emotional workup not the enthusiasm or excitement of being accepted and being one of them but really quickened in the soul that you know that you came from God and you go to God that you know you're part of God you know you're here to express a portion of the word then really it comes down to the point that what does my life matter anyway what is my reputation worth anyways I'm only here for 70 80 90 years or however space of time he gives me and then I will go on to my eternal reward amen I've come to the place now amen in in my life that the sixth Dimension or the marry supper whichever one I get to First amen Is So Glorious to me that I have no problem dropping this life to move to the next one and I couldn't have always said that because I had such a desire for things in this life experiences I wanted to have I wanted to get married I wanted to have children I wanted to experience these things but the more that I live in this hybrid flesh and the more I realize how wrong it is the thought of leaving this flesh is not a terrorizing thought it's a glorious thought it's a happy thought amen when we know where we're going so if we know we've been dropped into this Earth on assignment yes by purpose and will of God on assignment to accomplish something for his purpose then if I get spit on so what if I get rejected so what if if if everybody turns from me so what I'm here to accomplish his purpose to manifest his will and then to go on back to where I came from brother brandham said this time is just a little hickey on the circle of Eternity amen and it'll be sucked right back into eternity one day when God accomplishes what he wants to accomplish I came from eternity I'm going back to Eternity my whole existence is for eternity I'm only here playing a part and I want to play that part faithfully and I never came here to preserve my life like Jesus never came here to preserve his life I came here to surrender my life amen but been I've been given free choice in this dimension in this area of time in this vessel of clay I've been given free choice so that I could choose to lay down my life and let him have full control and so we must must lose the notion of self-preservation we must keep dying continually to Pride we must not let fear be our motivation I cannot count to you how many horrible decisions I've made because I was afraid I was afraid of what people would think I was afraid of what would happen if I don't move quickly I was afraid I I can't tell you how many decisions I made based off fear and many times It Was Fear I would look bad I would lose out I would fail if you see all those things keep pointing back to one thing me that's true make a horrible financial decision because if I don't jump on this now I'll lose the opportunity why so I could gain something financially right my fear was I would lose yes my fear was my reputation would suffer my fear was an opportunity to pass me by my fear was people would think bad of me and many of those decisions were disastrous some in major ways some in minor ways but that's not the choice love makes love makes a different choice yeah and we saw that in the life of Jesus Christ let's look at John 13 John 13 and10 this is John 13 we read every time we have feet washing once a month and after Jesus washed their feet verse 10 he says he uh Jesus saith in him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet this is he hasn't washed him yet this is before he washes him he that is washed is not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all so he knew about verse 11 for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean here we know that Jesus knew they weren't all clean Jesus knew that one of them was a devil Jesus Jesus knew that Judas would betray him Jesus knew he had the heart of a thief Jesus knew when they were when when they were in h in the house uh uh where Mary came and broke the alabaster box and Judas says this should have been sold and given to the poor Jesus knew why he said that CU he had the heart of a thief right and Jesus didn't call him out Jesus didn't rebuke him didn't make him ashamed of himself Jesus just simply said the poor you always have me you won't always have she's anointed me for my burial but he didn't he he knew but he didn't call him out I wonder how many of us could pass that test knowing exactly why a Brother's saying something but instead of shaming him and exposing him you just cover it over telling you I struggle with these things sometimes you know somebody's up to no good and all you want to do is expose it but we're going to find out that's not really what we're supposed to do so Jesus had Jesus is about to wash judas's feet and I don't believe Jesus washed him any differently than he washed Peter's or John's I don't believe he treated Judas any differently than he treated anybody else I believe he treated him all the same so much so they said one of you amen one of you shall betray me and they all said is it I is it I is it I it wasn't that he had been given the cold shoulder to Judas all week long it wasn't that I mean he barely washed his feet and moved on they had no clue who it was even when Jesus sent him away they assumed he went away on an errand to do something for Jesus they never assumed that it was he this is how Jesus treated his enemy he treated his enemy as a friend you know Billy Paul said in his testimony he said one amazing thing about brother bham he says you couldn't tell his enemies from his friends I said God help me I've got to grow I have to grow but but the purpose of preaching is so we know what we're what we're seeking after what we need what we're praying for saying God I need victory in this help me with this I need to die to myself I need to love everyone as a friend let's go over to Matthew 26 Matthew 26 and I'd like to read verse 47 this is in the Garden of Gethsemane in their coming Judas is leading a band to arrest Jesus in verse 47 he says and while he yet spake Lo Judas one of the 12 came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from Chief priests and Elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever I shall kiss that same as he hold him fast and forth with he came to Jesus and said hail master and kissed him and Jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come Jesus at the point of betrayal calls Judas his friend right never called him an enemy called him a friend he said friend friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him I just marvel at this this is our example no matter how hard it seems or how impossible but you know what I don't believe it's impossible I absolutely do not stand here today and believe that this is impossible I believe this is the age where it's become possible I believe this is the generation amen that will have the manifestation of the life of Jesus Christ I believe that's why God sent a prophet and He restored the word because when the word came back the life of that word came back and if the full measure of the word is back amen then the full life of that word is back here in the bride to bring about the full manifestation of the life of Jesus Christ I I look at this and I find myself short I'm short in many areas I'm fallen short of these things in many ways but I'm not discouraged I'm encouraged because the word is here that will bring me all the way to the full manifestation that God wants out of my life Luther had partial word he had partial life Wesley had partial word had partial life but we're not in the day of partial word and I'm not I'm not settling for partial life but I'm pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus because I believe this is the hour and God sent a word and sent his Spirit to bring that word to to life and that's what I'm depending on I'm not depending on doing better amen I've tried all my life and I failed but there's things that are changing in me that is not an effort it's a life amen the more I recognize and the more I Surrender the more that's exposed and the more I lay down the more something keeps changing in me and I'm not what I used to be I hope you're not what you were 2 three years ago I hope you're different than that see where we where we make our huge mistakes is where when we believe that we've come to maturity before we've come to maturity and we believe that we're just sitting in the church with the revelation of maturity and we're waiting for everybody else to catch up so we can all go home that's where we make a huge mistake sometimes and sometimes the one who feels are the most mature is the one who's actually the one who's suffering the most from pride and fear and self-preservation sometimes we're blind we see everything else well I don't say sometimes in reality we see everything else but the thing we miss is ourselves that's where the greatest blindness is the greatest blindness in our eyes is when we can't see ourselves it's amazing sometimes the most perfect people I ever meet are surrounded by flawed people and they know the flaws of everybody else but they don't realize that everybody else can see theirs so praise God when God begins to reveal them to us one by one we can say God I want to die to that I want to lay that down Lord I'm tired of defending myself I'm wore out with saving a reputation I have no reputation I don't want no reputation I don't I don't want a reputation because if I have a reputation then I have to defend a reputation I'm too tired to defend the reputation I just want to surrender and let God do whatever he wants to do and whatever anybody else thinks and whatever conclusion they want to come up with about me and about my life amen I want to get to the point I don't say I'm there yet but I want to get to the point where that doesn't matter as long as I know he's pleased with me then I'm okay if he's pleased with me even if everybody else misunderstands and doesn't agree and doesn't lie as long as I know he's pleased with me then I want that to be my satisfaction so we find that Jesus was a model friend he was a friend to his enemy so now when Billy Paul says you couldn't tell my my father's enemies from his friends I say praise God because that he was emulating Jesus Christ it didn't stop and William brandom we saw in Jesus Christ not even his disciples could tell his enemy that was among them from his friends and he knew who it was all along so it's not that the prophet it's not like we look at the prophet and say oh my goodness I want to have his life no he was reflecting the life of Jesus Christ he was bringing it in our day and showing in Fallen flesh that you can have the life that Jesus lived can be on display here did that make him perfect absolutely not we saw his mistakes too but that's part of the Perfection you say how are the mistakes part of the Perfection because Perfection is full maturity completeness Perfection is not sinlessness or flawlessness Perfection is completeness or maturity and we saw in the flaws he was corrected by the spirit of God and would come back and make it right that to me is perfection yes amen if he demonstrated flawlessness knowing he was sborn if he demonstrated of flawlessness then we would recognize There's Something Fishy but when we so openly saw his mistakes but we saw the correction we saw him make it right we saw the honesty we saw amen we saw him rebuked we saw him repented we saw all of that to me that was a display of perfection that's a Son of God who' come to adoption material and if it it wasn't just for him that was for me God showed that so I would know this is what I'm coming to yeah exactly right well I make mistakes a pile of them but God help me repent correct me by your spirit let me have that humility and that surrender that under rebuke I'll say Lord I'm sorry if we look at Luke let's go to Luke chapter 22 I just want to say that I pray that I'm never the kind of believer that can pass the doctrinal exam and fail in the life I don't ever want to be that kind of believer that I can tell you what was preached in what sermon in what order and what year he preached what but I but the people around me don't even enjoy being around me don't want that to be my kind of life I'd rather people say you know I'm not sure sure brother Chad understands it all but you know what he sure is a nice brother yes he's a good friend he's loving he seems genuine that that would do me that would do my heart good Luke 22 verse 33 and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death who is this Peter Peter Peter who was confident Peter Who Loved God when Jesus said that that you all are going to forsake me Peter is so sure sure that he loves the Lord so much he's not going to forsake Him Peter makes this statement he said I'm ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and Jesus said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before Thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me Peter thought that he loved the Lord and he did love the Lord I'm not want to take that away from Peter Peter loved the Lord Peter had a fervent desire and a love for the Lord amen and he loved him but we're going to find out that Peter actually still loved himself more than he loved Jesus right that's right not that he didn't love him but there was still too much self mixed in if we go to Matthew 26 back to where we were Matthew 26 and 73 we'll go down a little further and after a while came unto him they that that stood by and said Peter surely said to Peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech berth thee then began he to curse and to swear saying I know not the man and immediately the crew and Peter remembered the word of Jesus which said unto him before the cck crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and he went out and wept bitterly I I think it's amazing now that Peter all of a sudden his world comes crashing down he he he you know everything goes wrong contrary to what his thinking was and he thought that he would stand by the Lord he thought that he loved the Lord more than he loved everything else in the world Amen but when it really came down to the Press he found out that he was willing to forsake the Lord to save his own neck right to preserve his own life to preserve his own person he was willing to deny the Lord and when they didn't believe him he was willing to add cursings in on top of it and then when the grew he realized what he had done and he goes out and he repents and it's wonderful that Peter is broken now and we find after this the Lord comes to Peter and he restores him and when we come to see the Lord restoring Peter amen he comes to him by the Sea of tiberious and we have this whole thing where he says Peter does thou lovest me more than these and he repeats it three times amen because he denied the Lord Thrice and Jesus never shames Peter Peter was already ashamed he doesn't mock him he doesn't shame him he doesn't cast away from his presence he doesn't say he's not worthy to be a friend Jesus is the model friend when Jesus was forsaken when he was betrayed when he was forsaken when they all left him amen he never waited for them to come back to him to make it right he went to them right and he loved them amen and he never said anything about do you know what you did to me and you know how bad that hurt me and you know Jesus didn't do that you don't find him treating his disciples that way he comes to them he reveals himself to them he instructs them and he restores Peter back into fellowship with him when Peter wasn't able to do it Jesus did it he was the model friend and if Peter let say this way if Peter had done to me what he did to Jesus if he had done to you what would we do would we say nothing about it and just say Peter you're still my friend Peter do you love me that's what I thought do you love me this is where I want to be friends brother Bram says he he's he's going to give us some good instruction we're going to look now into some quotes and some scriptures where brother Bram gives us some outstanding instruction so we must love divinely love one another then you don't see your brother's mistake if he does make a mistake you never you look over the top of it and you love him anyhow see that's it love those that love you then does not the sinner the same thing but love those who doesn't love you that's what shows the spirit of God is in you because he loved you when you were his enemy and he loved you and that spirit's in you it'll make you love your enemy as you do your friend this is where it pretty tough and Jesus I would say he had every right to be offended at Judas Judah and he Judas and he had every right to be offended at Peter but he let he surrendered his life he made himself of no reputation he took on the form of a servant he lowered himself for Redemption amen and and he never he never held a grudge he never shamed anybody he never scold him he never mocked them he was a friend it's amazing Jesus never unfriended Judas where do you see in the Bible Jesus ever unfriended Judas right it was Judas who unfriended Jesus not Jesus who unfriended Judas he didn't unfriend Peter when Peter failed him he didn't underf unfriend the disciples when the disciples ran away amen it was never him that stopped being a friend it was always somebody else that stopped being his friend yes I said God help me that's the attitude I want to have every day of my life I don't want to go around cutting off relationships and not talking to you no more and not being a friend and giving you the cold shoulder and staying away from you amen my goodness God help me never to do a thing like that amen but help me to stand and remain a friend regardless of what anybody does to me let me give up my life to be like this amen let's go to John chapter 12 I'm not going to hit every one of these scriptures but I'm going to hit a few of them here John chapter 12 or 13 sorry John chapter 13 verse 34 a new commandment I give unto you John CH 13:34 a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another but this shall all men know that you are my my disciples if you have love one for another here's what brother bam says in the beginning of Christ is the mystery of God revealed we all know it I've read it before but I want to take some time in it in this context and brother brandham when he's coming to the beginning he gives instruction to the church and and here he is he's he's this is after the seals after the Revelation he's now going into Christ as the mystery of God revealed which to me is the one of the greatest Revelations of all time and in the beginning he starts instructing the church and this instruction is so pivotable PIV pivotal even at this time he says says love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness in things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman orever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so now do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together will the enemy come brother B said he would you know we think sometimes we're watching waiting for the enemy to come and not realizing he's coming all the time he's probing every Avenue he's he's jiggling every door to see if there's a window cracked and not he's probing every one of our lives trying to find an inlet so it's not like we'll sit here and wait for him to he's coming he's constantly coming he's constantly waiting for an advantage Amen to move in and work something amen but brother B's telling us what to do amen don't take sides don't begin to talk don't discredit you just stay sweet loving and kind that's the secret he's giving us the secret but the secret is death to self and you know what happens the first time we start seeing something like this take place all of a sudden we want to outsmart the devil we want to find out and we want to counteract act this counteracting this now they're bringing this in and they're starting a clannish thing here and they're Whispering a secret over here now I've got to counteract that and I've got to move into this and I and brother bam told us the only thing to do is lay down your life and forget about it don't try to preserve yourself don't try to save yourself just be sweet loving and kind I tell you I've failed so many times to protecting myself I've given up the job it's better just to surrender and say God I'm trusting you I'm trusting you you save me you defend me you protect me you preserve us I can't protect myself so when the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an En enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't never Clan among one or talk and make yourself clannish we are one I couldn't say left left hand I'm mad at you see this happens so many times in families it happens in churches it happens in workplaces something just gets stirred up and all of a sudden a little group starts to talk to one another and they've got the problems of everybody else in the workplace figured out that's what brother B's talking about don't do that amen we're all one we're not going to Clan up we're not going to draw aside we're not going to treat anybody indifferent we're not going to try brother B said the one who the devil shoots with poison and goes through the church you're not to try to push him out you're to draw him in that's what he said don't ever Clan among or talk and make yourself clannish we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not my not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another another right at with one another you find out sometimes there there'll be something to rise up between one family and another family little misunderstanding a little misinterpretation of something that happened and all of the sudden well I'll say cold war because we're Christians we don't break out in the full-blown open war is that right we don't yell and scream and call each other names but Cold War sets in cuz one family gotten offended at something another family did or Miss interpreted or misjudged a situation and all of a sudden they you know what we're supposed to do in that situation get that much closer together come together and don't let the devil and most of the time you're going to find out that it's an absolute 100% misunderstanding and if it's not and a brother Did You Wrong brother B said forget about it never mention it just love them anyways so either you can take this not notion either they didn't know what they were doing and I misunderstand the situation or they knew exactly what they were doing but my action has to be the same either way so then it comes down to the fact that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if they did it intentionally or it doesn't matter if they did it inadvertently my reaction must be the same reaction see if we can do this in our families and we can do this in the church and we can do this in our marriages and with our friendships amen you're going to find that we're going to close the doors to the devil where he doesn't have easy access to slip in and cause disruption now he goes on he says now you got tapes on that you got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God's in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to pray cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for another that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take Christ right out of my life I'm going to repeat that cuz that is so profound the brother if you think he's a little wrong now listen you're going to think a brother's a little wrong or a sister sure if it hasn't happened today it may happen tomorrow or next week because we're human beings and we're all still making mistakes and we're all misinterpreting one another and you're going to think your brother is wrong so what do I do yes this he said say you pray say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him my brother or sister and it'll take Christ right out of my life why because Christ is not going to inhabit the heart that's full of bitterness is not a welcome place for him he said that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw up take the Buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one one another and then God will bless you I want God to bless me I want the blessings of God to be heaped upon me and you say h you oh my goodness they asked brother Brenham one time we'll get to that quote in a minute he says how can you let people say such evil things about you he says you don't live for yourself right that's how you do it you don't live for yourself that's right praise God I want to read two scriptures out of Proverbs Pro let's go back to Proverbs and start in Proverbs 16 Proverbs 16:28 says a forward man SE is strife and a Whisperer separateth cheap friends what brother Brenham telling us is just not his opinion he's speaking straight script scripture right to begin to talk and to say did you know what that one did and did you hear and I mentioned this before but but I'll tell you I mean it I just like to expose the enemy when somebody comes and says did you hear what's going on such and such family I'm only telling you so you can pray I'm telling you I don't believe that statement one drop I don't believe it they're using that a religious mask to gosp gossip I'm only telling you so you can pray why do you have to tell me to pray you pray do you not believe God hears you when you pray and why do you have to tell me all the details if you want me to pray why can't you see just pray for this family I think they're having a hard time why do you have to give me all the juicy details of what might be going wrong see it's a mask for gossip and that's the problem because just as soon as you go and repeat it and you don't have the details right and one tells another one so that they can pray and one tells another one so they can pray pretty real you find out that nobody's praying but everybody's relaying what we we need to pray about and the prayer request gets more lip service than the actual prayer for the need help us God help us and we're going to read some more let's go to Proverbs 179 I I I mean I got ahead of my scripture but praise God anyhow Proverbs 179 he that cover a transgression seeketh love yes but he that repeatthedose separateth very friends yes praise be to God let's go over to Ephesians we are not here to expose each other's flaws we are here to cover for one another and love each other that's why I think the symbology of feet washing is so important because as we wash one another's feet you realize that in in in that day when they would go to the bath there was communal bath houses and they would go to the bath house and they would be cleaned and this is what Jesus is saying amen because he told him they're clean by the word that I've spoken unto you and he says then when he comes to the Last Supper he say you are clean but not all amen just saving your feet and what he's referring to is the communal bath house where they would go and they would get clean and then they would come back to their apartment or to the house or wherever they're staying and on the way back they would pick up some dust or dirt on the feet they've been cleansed but in their Journey Through the world they picked up a little bit of dirt and now Jesus was going to kneel down and wash that little bit of dirt for by transgressing the World by not transgressing what am I trying to say traveling through the world so he washes that bit off him and and he says you're clean he already told him you're clean by the word I spoken unto you amen he already says sanctify them by thy truth Thy word is true they are already clean but there's a journey in life where we pick up dirt along the way and Jesus come to wash that off his disciples then he says you wash each other I'm not here to criticize your dirty feet my job is to get down and take your dirt with my own hands and wash it off of you Amen to help you as my brother and you come and wash my feet so when we have feet washing it's not just a tradition it's not we come once a month we then we don't come begrudgingly amen it's symbolic of what we're supposed to be living on a daily basis I'm not here to take pictures of your feet amen and post them on the internet and see my brother he spped in something there come on now it's better if I just say hey brother I think you might have stepped in something come here let me wash your feet he said like I said these things aren't profound but they're profound they're simple but they're The Stumbling Stones they're the easy things but it's the place we're failing in yes sir but I don't think we're meant to fail forever praise God Ephesians chapter 4:31 Ephesians chapter 4:31 he says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you I love when he says forgive one another even as God for Christ sake have forgiven you and the question is how did God forgive me yes did he give did he forgive me before I asked him to or after did he forgive me when I was clean or when I was dirty did he forgive me when I come back and said forgive me or did he forgive me before I ever asked and we're supposed to forgive one another the same way God has forgiven us for Christ's sake so can I for Christ's sake forgive you sure if God for Christ's sake can forgive me then I for Christ's sake can forgive you the same way he forgave me and did and did God ever ask you to pay for your wrongs no Jesus paid for your wrongs so why would I ask you to pay for your wrong against me I should forgive you the same way I've been forgiven if I've been freely forgiven I should freely forgive and I shouldn't demand that you meet my requirements for forgiveness and you pay back and you make it right right say who would ever say that it's exactly what you say when you say well I'll forgive you but I'll never forget it and I can't know that I can be a friend like that again and blah blah blah blah blah what you're doing is still holding somebody in contempt and God never forgave you that way praise God so when Paul says I press toward the mark of the high calling it's a high calling but it's the call calling for the elect in this age remember Peter asked Jesus said how many times should I forgive my brother when he's offended me we learned this as a child seven times no seven what did he say until 70 times s my goodness I can't count that high without a recording device I would forget if you made 490 times or not and that's the point yes point is I'm not supposed to hold an offense against anyone supposed to forgive not supposed to hold a grudge not supposed to hold bitterness I'm not supposed to Remember The Faults I'm not supposed to hold on to those things I'm not supposed to repeat it or speak about it but if I seek love I'm to cover a transgression yes not to expose it brother B said in 1958 in the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said and there's nothing wrong there was nothing wrong with any of the members brother B said he was going around fixing up little fusses that had been in the church he mentions it at a couple places in the same area in 1958 towards the end of 1958 and he said there's nothing wrong there was nothing wrong with any of the members so that's amazing statement that he comes and makes because there was little fusses he had to go straighten up but he said there was nothing wrong with any of the members there everyone fine men and women if they could just realize that that's the devil gets between the people that's exactly right it's not the people if you can let a brother see that then he won't hold enmity against the other fellow he'll feel bad he'll feel like well that's I feel sorry for my brother see if he did do wrong why it wasn't the brother it was the devil that did that amen you say well this guy did a certain certain thing your brother didn't do that your sister didn't do that that was the devil got into them that did it so don't blame the brother the sister blame the devil that's the one who caused it yeah amen and brother B said if you can get somebody to realize this they won't have enmity but they'll feel sorry if you can get to the place where somebody actually says something against you I mean they said something wrong and they said something hurtful and they shouldn't have said it they misunderstood a situation they repeated something wrong if you can get to the place to recognize this is a tactic of the devil and I'm not going to fall so easily to the devil's WS but I realized that my brother was just a tool in the devil's hands it wasn't him that brother loves me how do you know that brother loves you because if he loves Christ he loves me he can't help it sometimes we've got to fly a little higher On Eagle's Wings and have Eagle Vengeance and get out of the Cardinal and stop with all the offense and the hurt and he said and she said and fly a little higher and find out who's moving the chest pieces and you realize now I feel sorry for my brother and you know why I feel sorry for my brother because I'm going to forgive him I'm going to let it go and I'm never going to mention it but someday I know that brother's going to feel sorry for what he did and now I feel for him with compassion I'm not angry I'm not upset I don't want him to get in trouble I don't want God to spank him I don't want lightning to fall on him I don't want to get in a car accident on the way to work I really want to forgive him and let him go and ask God to forgive him and let him go and realize my brother didn't mean to and I know someday he'll be sorry for that and when that day comes I know what it's like cuz I've been sorry for things I did wrong and I know how horrible it is and how bad you feel and how sh shamed you are and how you how how you feel like you failed God and your brother and I know that my brother's going to go down that same road and I'm feeling sorry for him now see you realize I'm getting the I'm I'm getting the the the the the pity off of myself and I'm turning it outward and saying God help my brother he didn't mean to do that my sister you know what let's say that you assume that they didn't mean to but really they did how will it hurt you to assume that they did they didn't I would rather be found in error assuming my brother and sister didn't mean to then always in error assuming they did well I just don't want to be a fool I don't be taken for a fool I'd rather be taken for a fool than actually act like a fool amen prise God I'd rather be taken for a foolish childish doesn't understand what's going on around him brother Chad just doesn't get it I'd rather be in that position than be the one who's wise and understand I see what you're doing you're manipulating you're and I'm calling it out and I'm wrong half the time then you Heap shame and foolishness upon yourself say God help us we got to recognize that these are the tactics of the enemy not tactics of my brother brother and sister Proverbs 10:12 I'll just read it to you Proverbs 1012 says hatred stirreth up stries but love coverthe God while we're in Ephesians let's jump over to First Peter 1 Peter 1:22 the things that we're talking about this is the church I want to be a part of Amen the church that can apply the principles that brother bham gave us the scripture gave us the example of Jesus Christ that and that's the kind of person I want to be that's the kind of friend I want to be to you and that's the kind of friend I want to have that's the kind of church I want to go to that's the kind of family I want that's the kind of marriage I want this is what we want yes in 1 Peter 1:22 it says seeing you have purified your soul souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned that means not pretentious or not fake genuine unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently that means intensely how are we supposed to love each other without pretense not faking we're not supposed to fake it and if you got to that place where you're having to fake it it's time to get on your knees and say God get me to the place where I'm not faking it with this brother or sister because you got be real and God knows when you're real and most of the time the other people know when you're real too this isn't about being pretentious this is not about mockery this is not about playing a role and acting out a part that you don't genuinely believe but it's about realizing I have ought against this brother I have ought against this sister and I need God to take this out of my heart because it'll it'll hurt them and it'll take the Christ right out of my life it's more serious sometimes than we we really right think about we we think about sometimes the the things we got to watch out for the big the big blazing S no it's the little foxes that spoil the vine but this is the fellowship I want to be in this is the fellowship I want to give this is the kind of brother I want to be and I I know I failed you all probably a thousand times in this but I'm telling you this is the brother I want to be and these are the Brethren I want you to be I want to dwell in Brothers in a fellowship of brothers and sisters who have this is their greatest desire amen let's go to John 15 now I just want to I started here and I want to get down to the real heart of this again John chapter 15 verse 12 Jesus says this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends now Jesus is telling us this is my commandment to you we know when we read no greater love has no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends we know that he is going to demonstrate that he is going to act it out and we're going to watch that happen in Jesus Christ but he didn't just say I'm going to do this he was telling us to do this this wasn't a commandment for him although he would flesh it out and demonstrate it this was a commandment for you and I let's read it again this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you that means the same way yes amen love one another the same way I Loved You Then he goes on to say greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends if we're going to love one another the same way he loved us then we are going to have to lay down our lives for our friends we are going you say am I going to go get shot be executed maybe probably not but Jesus gave up his life in so many other ways brother B said he had a right to a home he had a right to a wife he wanted to live with his disciples he didn't want to leave but he gave up all of his rights because the love he had for the brethren in obedience to the father he lost his reputation his glory everything he gave it all up yes because he loved me he allowed vile men on to spit in his face he didn't do anything about it he allowed a mock Kangaroo Court an absolute foolishness try him with with no good case no clear-cut case no agreeing Witnesses it was a mockery and he didn't do anything to defend himself he didn't he didn't ched anybody he didn't defend himself he didn't protect himself he didn't protect his reputation he didn't do anything and why did he do that he did that for me and he asked me to love you the same way he loved me you know sometimes we separate friendship we we saw here David's Act of friendship was rejected because of Suspicion they misinterpreted what he wanted and they rejected and they created a big mess sometimes there's fear that caus us to break relationship we fear somebody's not being genuine or fear that we're going to lose our reputation sometimes our friends shame us because of their failure and we distance ourselves from them that's wrong amen we do that to family members sometimes they shame us so we distance ourselves from them that is not how Jesus loved me have I shamed him yes have I brought a reproach against his name yes sometimes we'll be ashamed of one another sometimes you'll be ashamed maybe of your spouse maybe you'll be ashamed of one of your children maybe a child will be ashamed of their parent that's no time to break friendship and save your reputation and pull away yes amen that's not how Jesus loved me what is that all about anyways it's about Pride yes it comes down to rank nasty Pride yes that's right that I don't want to fellowship with a brother anymore because that brother made a big mistake and I don't want to look like I'm associated with that I don't want people to on Lord Jesus help us and we've done it and put religious labels on top of it come on now yes yes I don't want to be that kind of friend I don't want to be the kind of friend that never calls when something bad happens but only calls when it's good that's not how Jesus loved his disciples and that's not how I want to love you and that's not how I want you to love me because none of us are going to make it perfect and we're not all going to make it look good right but I'm not I don't want to pull away from you because you make a mistake and I don't want you to pull away from me cuz I make a mistake but I want us to love one another and no greater love has any man than this that he lays down his life for a friend can we give up our reputation for each other can we give up our reputation for our spouses can we give up our reputation for our children say God help me sometimes we separate friendship for Envy cuz a brother has a position or he's gotten more attention or something and and we don't realize it but we begin to pull away and because it's envy that comes right back to the same old nasty Pride but greater love has no man than this that he laid down his life for his brother if my brother gets something he gets rewarded somehow by God or he receives a gift or he gets a position I want to be happy for him I want him to go higher than me I want him to have more than I have I want that kind of love there's so many things that this pride and fear does yes causes us to try to preserve ourselves save our reputation become envious become jealous we become suspicious that's not pure love that's all self right and that's what we're trying to do is die I've been given life I've been given breath in and out of my lungs I've been given a life in this Dimension so that I can by my own choice die that's right I've been given an existence in this life so that I by my own choosing can choose to die yes I can die a thousand different ways I can die thousands of different times I can die when somebody mocks me I can die when somebody criticizes I can die when somebody it questions me I can die when somebody misunderstands me I can die when somebody falsely accuses me I can die we get thousands of opportunities to die this isn't a one-time death this is a dying out to self and God is going to make sure that as a iron sharpeneth iron so does a friend sharpeneth the countenance of his friend that sometimes there's going to be some rubbing so that you and I can die there's going to be some mistakes so that you and I can die there's going to be things that don't always go right but things that can go wrong so that you and I can die yes exactly right I say God help me die to all this self that I'm so sick of that's why friends when you get to looking at this subject when you really get to looking at all of these subjects and the depth of it and the reality of what we've been called to to actually live the life of Jesus Christ in this flesh when you look at it then you realize without him I'm finished if it's not his Spirit living in me if I don't surren surrender and give up myself and keep giving myself to him keep receiving his word and letting it strip me I'm finished and that's why I tell you that I'm not I I'm not dreading the day that I pass out of this life either through a translation or through death I'm looking forward to it yes praise God I want to read this one more quote as we close it's that message it's the message that day on Calvary I've been listening to that message I absolutely have been loving this message says now what must we do now the first thing that I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you Haven an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when he came in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal Life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons you are Sons you're taking Christ's place you are Sons so don't live for yourself live for others so well brother random I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who'd kill you if they could that's what they' done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you get that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards Calvary if we ever if we ever find ourselves in a spot where we're offended have you ever been offended I've been offended recently I won't tell you how recently but very recently and you realize the only way you can feel offense is if you still have self yes sir that's the only way you can feel an offense so the minute you feel that offense you got to start judging that and say why am I offended right somebody spped on my toes they said something they shouldn't have I well you know what God bless them anyhow God bless them anyhow I want I want to look to Calvary and take that example when we start struggling with these things what we need to do is look to Calvary and look at what Jesus went through leading up to Calvary his Earthly Journey leading to Calvary and the death itself s and that's how he wants me to love others Proverbs 13:10 says only by Pride cometh contention yes yeah have you ever been contentious that means argumentative and felt Justified like somebody had to tell him the Bible says only by Pride cometh contention where there's no Pride there's no contention right and I want to ask you too how many people have you told off that they changed their mind and it changed their life all you did was make yourself feel better because you got a little domination you got to give him a piece of your mind I'd rather give him a piece of the mind of Christ than a piece of my mind I'd rather give him a demonstration of self-sacrifice and true love then selflove and pride because only by Pride cometh contention praise God he said in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said I love you don't forget the Commandments of God to you little children love one another love everybody right or wrong sinner or Saint now we just took it outside the church I'm going to read that again don't forget the Commandments of God to you little children love one another love everybody right or wrong wrong sinner or Sint love them anyhow if you don't then pray God to help you cuz God loved the Sinner and the nature of God is in you if the man is wrong love him anyhow don't partake of his sin seed don't partake of his sins but in sweetness not in sourness and rebuke in sweetness tell him of the hope of life that rests within you through Jesus Christ being revealed to you by the holy ghost man tells us he said live humble this is in 1965 trying to do God a service live humble live loving love one another don't never get nothing among you if you see something coming up in your heart against somebody get it out of there right then don't let it Fester don't act upon it but get on your knees and say God I need your help because you know what you're never going to be able to just to wish it away if it's not if there's something that comes up in your heart if there's an offense or you feel like something was unjust or something happened and it needs to be made right and you feel that coming up in your heart that ought against somebody amen that's when we have to go to prayer and say God I'm in desperate need because this is going to cause bitterness and bitterness will destroy me and everyone around me God would you please root this out of my life and give me your love for that brother or sister I need the kind of love that can be nailed to a cross spit on mocked made fun of and everybody reject rejected in the world and I can say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's the kind of love I need and we feel that offense coming or that a we need to get on our knees and ask God to give us that love yes I want to read one more scripture together and we'll close let's go to Ecclesiastes together it's another simple one but I I want to read this one Ecclesiastes right after Proverbs Ecclesiastes chapter 4 I want to start at verse 8 Ecclesiastes 4 and8 there is one alone and there is not a second y he hath neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labor neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he for whom do I labor and beve my soul of good this is all vanity yeah it is a sore travail this is a man who's all by himself this is what his life is like then read verse n two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for Heath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warmed alone and if one Prevail against two one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken God never intended for us to be alone he wanted us to have friends God never intended us to have Fellowship all by oursel CU we can't get along with anybody and go off and listen to tapes and have only us and only our family CU everybody else is wrong God never wanted that that's a miserable life according to ecclesias but God wanted us to be in Fellowship sheep of a f wanted us to have some somebody to lean on in time of trouble somebody that will cover for me when I need covered for so that I can cover for somebody else God never wanted us to be alone but he wanted us to be in Fellowship God never wanted us to be friendless but he wanted to be our friend and he wanted us to love one another I say praise God I want to be this kind of friend let's all Stand Together musicians if you please [Music] come I can say this is the kind of friend I want to be to you and if you ever see me being a different kind of friend than that please forgive me and pray for me and if you if I ever see you being a different kind of friend than this I will do the same for you and let's love one another let's encourage one another Comfort one another let's wash one another's feet let's keep the devil at Bay and not become easy pray for him let's keep the doors closed the windows fasten let's keep our fellowship secure by dying to ourselves for one another amen God bless you let's pray together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for your goodness to us Lord Jesus we realize we need you Lord we need you more every day father father there's so many traps laid there's so many WS of the devil all around us trying to ruin what you're doing trying to stop us trying to hinder us slow us down turn us around he's always trying trying to break Fellowship trying to ruin the sweet atmosphere that you've provided trying to break up Lord your presence of your Holy Spirit in our lives but oh God you've given us instruction and although it may be simple but without you we can't do it we need you Lord we need your spirit for you were able to sacrifice yourself you were able to lay down your life you were able to love sacrificially I pray God that you would come into each one of us and that you would give us that same love the way that we can lay down our lives for our friends God help us not to be suspicious of one another to be misunderstand each other's motives but help us to believe the best at all times God help us not to speak evil of one another or spread things we shouldn't but help us to cover transgressions cover sin and seek of love God I pray you'd help us to die to our own Pride that drives all of these things so that the devil won't have a tool to work with may we become as dead men that don't need to defend themselves would protect their reputation help me Lord to surrender myself for your children help me to love my brothers and sisters my family my wife my friends the way you love me God by this all men shall know that we are your disciples when we have love one for another God I surrender to you I confess my faults my failures but Lord I'm trusting in you to bring me higher CU you've exposed it in my life and I'm surrendering to this word and recognizing that it's true and I raise my hands to you acknowledging that I want this to be true in my life that I'm surrendering my life to you and I want to die a greater death to myself and I want you to take more portion in me yes oh help me to love the way you love thank you Father and I ask you bless us as we go may we shine the light of your gospel everywhere we go and may the reality that you've brought in This Day become a living reality in our personal lives and I thank you God I want to thank you right now for this Fellowship I thank you Lord for a room full of brothers and sisters that I love with all my heart and I know they love me God I know Lord that in a time of trouble they can be depended on Lord they would stand near and I would do the same for them Lord You've blessed us help us not to forsake or forget what you've blessed us with but help us to nurture it so that it'll grow
