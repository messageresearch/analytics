[0:00] and we know God we saw the son of man
[0:03] Ministry we saw a son of man revealing
[0:05] the son of man that was Jesus Christ the
[0:07] son of man had returned and was working
[0:09] through a son of man that Prophet amen
[0:12] but that son of man didn't leave the
[0:14] Earth when the prophet left the Earth
[0:16] because that that a son of man was there
[0:19] to unite The Head and the body together
[0:21] in the wedding Amen to do what to
[0:23] reproduce the son of man again so now
[0:27] that dispensation is in Bride for
[0:31] in between Son of God and Son of David
[0:34] in between priest and judge or and King
[0:38] amen and the time of Judge and you say
[0:41] then then all of a sudden we have to
[0:43] think oh my goodness you think now if
[0:45] that's the case if there's a unification
[0:48] here if the white wigged one has
[0:50] descended and come down the Supreme
[0:51] judge of all Heaven and Earth looking
[0:53] down with eyes of judgment and he's come
[0:55] to unite with the body and now the sash
[0:57] is about the girdles about the breast
[0:59] and sash over the shoulders we see this
[1:01] dispensational change we say if we're in
[1:03] judgment is there no more Mercy on
[1:07] that's always the
[1:09] question but I'll tell you this there's
[1:11] only one person that can ever extend
[1:14] mercy and the only person in all of our
[1:17] governments that can extend Mercy is the
[1:20] judge the only place to get Mercy is at
[1:24] the Judgment seat you don't get Mercy
[1:26] anywhere else but at the Judgment seat
[1:28] cuz the Judgment seat is the mercy seat
[1:31] and then the Judgment seat becomes The
[1:33] Mercy Seat when when the blood which is
[1:36] the life is upon the Judgment seat it
[1:39] becomes a mercy seat so what did the
[1:40] blood represent it represented the life
[1:43] what is the life the life is the life of
[1:45] Jesus Christ where is it it's in the
[1:47] church it's upon the Judgment seat
[1:49] making it a mercy seat because you can
[1:52] only get Mercy at a judgment
[1:55] seat if you say hey I've committed this
[1:58] crime and I've done this and I've done
[1:59] that you've got to go before some judge
[2:01] somewhere to get acquitted of that to
[2:04] have mercy there's got to be somebody
[2:05] that'll be that has the right to judge
[2:08] and that person with the right to judge
[2:10] is the only one that has the right to
[2:12] give
[2:13] Mercy the police officer can't give you
[2:16] Mercy the one who arrested you the one
[2:17] who keeps you in jail none of them can
[2:19] give you Mercy only at the Judgment seat
[2:22] can you find
[2:25] mercy God
[2:28] Amen why did he move from priesthood
[2:31] into judge because he's no longer
[2:33] covering for the sins of ignorance
[2:34] through the church ages he's brought the
[2:36] fullness of the word now the fullness of
[2:38] the word is available he's not covering
[2:41] for sins of ignorance now he's now he's
[2:43] here as a judge but he's still offering
[2:46] Mercy to those who can come to
[2:48] it
