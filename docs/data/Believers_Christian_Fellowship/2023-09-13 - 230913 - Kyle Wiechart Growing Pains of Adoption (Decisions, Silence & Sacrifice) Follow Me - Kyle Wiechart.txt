Prayer most gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord that thou has given us this evening Lord by your grace you assembled us this evening father we counted an honor Lord to be able to come into a place Lord that you've set aside and Sanctified come to amongst the people Lord that you've set apart and Sanctified and called unto yourself and hear a present tense truth Lord that can transform us from the creatures that we were unto Sons and Daughters of God living as New Creations in Christ Jesus father God it's just a tremendous honor and a privilege and we thank you from the depths of our heart and from our soul and so father God lord we come yielding ourselves to you as a people that are here to hear the word I myself include him and speaking but I'm listening to father to what your spirit would say to me Lord the whole objective Lord is to draw one step closer to you father the objective of every teaching every preaching everything we do is in an effort that we ourselves and those that we minister to can draw closer into your presence father that's the objective of my heart I believe that's the objective of everyone that's come tonight not to be seen not to do a religious duty but father God to hear your word and draw closer to thee father anoint our faith it's in our hearts as the word comes forth may we mix that word with the faith that you placed inside of us and may it become a living reality that we express to the rest of the world we love you we commit this time into your hands in Jesus name amen amen God bless you I think you all heard what I heard amen I almost wanted to stop and say he's here God bless you brother Emmanuel man we're all happy to have you here my my looking forward to Wednesday you get a lot of sleep and then plan on being here for hours upon hours brother we're looking forward to thank you musicians will it fall off my lot to be on this side of the pulpit today so you pray for me if you don't mind let's tell them brother Chad it never fails I always have a really bad day before I Minister and I don't sleep so that's just par for the course I guess it just keeps me weak and dependent and maybe that's always the way he wanted it to be so there's a purpose behind all those things and so if you don't mind I'll have you turn right to the scriptures here two portions of scripture here in the Philippians and in First Corinthians but we'll start in Philippians chapters 2. verse 3. chapters 2 verse 3 Philippians and just say Amen when you get there amen the scripture reads let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross the next scripture if you don't mind the short portion and um oh I'm sorry it's Luke I changed it I'm sorry I changed it last minute I am never comfortable with my notes all the way up to when I step into the pulpit and so I felt to change that Luke 9 23 oh if you only knew how dependent I am Luke 9 23. and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life will lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall save it amen may God add His blessings to the reading of his word he may be seated so I have a lot of notes and I'm nervous because it's a Wednesday night and so I hope I can have Grace in your sight because I'm I already you can tell I'm slow I'm tired so I'm talking slow and then I look at all these notes and I'm like wow how are we going to get through all this but I just believe that God has a way of doing things and there's a reason why I mess up my scriptures and I change things around and he doesn't let me get sleep at night and maybe he just needs me to rest and calm down a little bit and so sometimes he allows those things to happen I have a thing I'd like to speak on tonight and um I'm it's hard for me to even say this I think I'm starting a series can I say that like you don't see how much you're laughing like me say series is like that's an oxymoron but I think I've I'm technically going to be preaching a third part to adoption and uh which is really hard for me to say um and so I I have this and I just handed it on to brother uh Franco I says you do what you want with this title but my title is The Growing Pains of adoption and as a first subtitle decisions silence and sacrifice and as for a text or a subtitle to my subtitle follow me and so as you all know for the last few months I've just been stuck on adoption and I had ministered a first time on this about three months ago to the youth and so for tonight this will be a third part but for you all here the older youth this is the second part for the last time I was here I preached on into the Silence of adoption the first time I preached then I I ministered to the youth and I brought the adoption of sons and I I titled that one your time of decision adoption of sons your time of decision because I began to see there's a decision that becomes very clear um a harder way a choice that one makes to continue on into the pathway of adoption but then when I was out in Oregon this last couple weeks ago I noticed something about the third step and that was the sacrifice of the individual and so that's why I've got this Growing Pains of adoption because I've seen a pattern and the pattern this decision leads to silence which leads to a sacrifice and I'd like to go through that with you if you don't mind and for me it's helped me a lot to actually identify where I'm at in life you know we came up we all grew we all Never Enough none of us came to Christ as a mature Christian we're all been growing and we learn obedience through suffering and many times we suffer by the mistakes that we ourselves make and we suffer um because we do things wrong and oftentimes it's not anybody doing anything to us we've reacted wrong we interpret something wrong and it was supposed to be there for a purpose it was supposed to mold us and shape us and make us something mature us as sons and daughters and oftentimes we just react incorrectly I know I have and brother Gabe at least I'm not the only one right amen makes me feel better I ain't the only one make big mistakes and the reality of it is sometimes we just we just um we just need to grow up it's hard to sound just to be honest with you right the sister got broke grow up I gotta grow up and so as I was looking at these um decisions when I when I brought it to the youth the first portion there um it became very clear to me that as we come into adoption we we come to some tough decisions and we have to suffer many times with the decisions we make and many times we want God we're like hey Lord um where are you at in this situation and he's like well you made your own decision and you want God to deliver you from a bad decision that you make and it's such a unique situ situation because you come to find out you're making many decisions because of your own will your will wasn't his will you made your own decisions and it wasn't his decision for you and then you suffer the consequences of your bad decision because you didn't wait to hear God many times a person would say I'm having marriage problems I don't know did you marry the one that God wanted you to marry there's so many times like Lord why don't you intervene did you pray about your marriage before you got married did you just look for a pretty face and a pretty figure or were you care were you looking for character or something on the inside well God come save me in my marriage you made a bad decision I don't mean to be you know Lord come and fix my job replace my boss he's horrible did you pray about it or did you just get a bigger paycheck and took the job you know what I'm saying I'm just talking to you real plain to live just bring it down to reality for a second many times we want God to Deliver Us from the bad decisions we make because you weren't doing you weren't about the father's business you were about your own business and then God stands back it's like now you want my help you certainly didn't invoke me in the beginning you certainly wasn't looking for my leadership in that decision you wanted to do your own thing you wanted an easier way yes and so but that's not my subject because I've moved on to a third part so sorry only the youth know that whole sermon on decisions and um I'd like to just read some basis here for foundation that's okay because if you weren't here I just want to lay some things out in this adoption process of sons because we're predestinated into the adoption of sons you know what I fail but he's predestinated me to come to this adoption I make big mistakes I don't get it right I don't see the picture at all the time but I'm predestinated I've been forwarding and elected to be conformed into the image of this dear son so even my mistakes will pave the way for that adoption and so brother Branham says in modern events May clear by prophecy he said the shuck held it but now the shuck pulls away it has to remember 20 years has passed by and no more denominations has come out of it and it won't we're at the end of denominations the Wheats taking shape what's the matter with the wheat now it must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen before the combine picks it up amen and I believe that's what's going on I believe we're learning things now more intensely we're now checking motives and objectives and Leadership and why we make the decisions we're really seeing if we're about the father's business we're truly he's truly checking how you learn are you learning are you knowing when to be silent when I'm silent are you running going fast doing your will are you really considering my will in the situation because ultimately I know God wants Fellowship like at the end of the day God wants to be loved and God wants to restore fellowship with me yes and if he has to allow for this life to get really tough to restore Fellowship how many would say Amen that's okay because really what your soul what what are you craving what like like it was so interesting to me yesterday I was like it's always Bittersweet when I get asked to minister because this is the part that really scares me but I love the day before the night before the day the hours before I step into this place and I began to think about last night I'm like why do I love that so much like I love time with my girls I love time with my wife I love time and fellowship with you all but I'm telling you there is nothing more precious to me there's something that happens when I'm all by myself and I've pushed work away and I've pushed calls away and I I made an effort to just isolate myself from the whole world and the influences and the cares of life and consecrate myself to put myself in the position so that I can hear from God and go and say something that could help people and and to hear from myself to help me because I need to hear too and I know and the last time I think like oh I wish I could live like that every day and then struck me I'm like why don't I is that not allowed am I not allowed to live in a world all to myself like Jesus did where I keep everything at an arm's length distance I keep problem situations difficulties of this Natural Life out here so that I can maintain behind the veil closed in with him God like is that possible because the question the reality is it is brother Shea because why is that burning in my heart why is that a deep calling that I don't have to just feel his presence when I'm just preparing for a sermon why can't I feel that presence Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday no matter what the problem what the situation I'm shut in and you know what I began to realize I made a conscious effort to push everything back and not let it come into this space that I have between him and me I I did something it's Unique for me I like I it it's like man Kyle you're slow you didn't realize I'm like yeah I didn't realize it guys I just realized it I made a conscious effort to set you could have called me yesterday and said your rental properties are all on fire and that's I don't care I have insurance it doesn't bother me all your employees they quit it's okay I'm just holding you all out there it's like don't bother me don't bother me I'm shut in I'm shut in I've got something I know I know every time I make an appointment with him he's there he's just there yes but we let we just let life just convince us that he can't be that close to us I don't believe that I don't believe that I believe brother Branham said I never preach in such a way to draw people to myself or that they should come to my church he said I have one objective and that is this one goal if I can achieve this one thing that is to restore a spiritual relationship between God and man where they can live as New Creations in Christ Jesus let of his Spirit walking according to his word that's his objective that was his objective I'll tell you what that's my desire and I believe that's the purpose he was sent for to restore me back into fellowship with God I don't have to live like the world lives I can live in the presence of God each and every day way far away from notes so can I read I'm I'm going to read I'm asking your permissions like well I'm going to read this portion Blasphemous names 1962. he says see a family when a son is born into it it's a son but that son had tutors to raise it and if that son never did come to be the right kind of a son he can never become an heir but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son will be adopted and placed positionally he's become now an heir of all that the father had and that's what God was doing on Mount Transfiguration when he took his own son after he had been proved to be the right son see he had stood all the Temptations and he took him here up on Mount Transfiguration and he overshadowed him dropping down one portion he says there is where the Pentecostal people have made their mistake being born into the family by the Holy Ghost that's right but then we must be made we must be the right kind of a child being tutored by the right tutor I'm under instruction you're under instruction the Holy Ghost wasn't just given to you just to give you a security the Holy Ghost was there to guide you to teach you like a student or like a teacher training a student he's gonna he's gonna teach you a lesson he's going to mold you and shape you and cut you let you make that decision let you take that job because you make more money but it takes you away from the church lets you move to a place that you no longer can have fellowship with with your family you can't no longer do family devotions you can't even get alone with God anymore he's going to let you make the decision go for opportunity and you know what many times you think God's in it because He blesses you in it you think God is in that because you're financially being blessed but your soul is being sacrificed so I want to ask you a question was that the will of God no amen then you cry out to God why are my children this way or why are my wife this way or why am I so cold and backslidden you made a decision of your own will that was contrary to the will of God now you want God to come fix your bad mistakes we're just learning everyone I'm guilty you're guilty everybody relax don't worry everybody's guilty calm down we're all human we make big mistakes that's the reality of it but God deals with us as Sons he's maturing us he's shaping us he's molding us he's making us into the thing that he had a picture of in the back of his mind he had a perfect picture of your Perfection and I'm coming to it and you're coming to it amen we just may come there a little slower at times but that's okay and so I want to continue on before we get into these decisions and silence and sacrifice because I saw those three patterns of an adopted son in Jesus I saw it in the Book of Joshua because Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians which is the adoption book I saw it also in the life of brother branna and I've also seen it in the bride and it's just the pattern so it's just a simple teaching but I want you to see the pattern maybe you'll find yourself in the process because I believe we're identified in Bible characters aren't we and that's why I've subtitled to my title was follow me he showed us the pathway that we're going to take brother Branham even showed us the pathway of an adopted son Jesus showed it to us Israel and them taking the promised land and being positionally placed in their promise and they showed it to you the whole thing was showing you what God was going to do with his bride so as the last time we came we realized there's redemption in the fourth stage you have justification which makes the way for sanctification which makes way for the baptism the Holy Spirit which makes way for the person of Jesus Christ himself to come and have preeminances in your life right that's the process that we're coming to we're not stopping anywhere along the journey amen amen okay I'm going all the way who's going all the way sorry I'm going to invoke you to come back and talk to me a little bit here they're a little too quiet for a second here so I'm going all the way okay we're going there so we knew that in justification was found in the book of Romans right and so being Romans it says you're justified by faith not by the Deeds of the law we moved on into Corinthians I'll go fast Corinthians being the sanctification book where he says in the uh the second verse of chapter one he says to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus we know it's a sanctification then we go on into Galatians we have the baptism of the Holy Spirit right he says oh foolish Galatians who's Bewitched you this one thing that I've learned have you received the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith then we came up into Ephesians which we knew we were predestinating to the adoption of sons and then it came into Philippians and that's where my opening verse was because as you look into Philippians being that is the the fifth we'll say first one Romans second one uh Corinthians third Galatians fourth the book of adoption Ephesians the fifth one being Philippians and I had to correct myself I remembered when I actually said it here the last time I said look Grace but I said it when it came to Colossians it was in Philippians that's the fifth book f-a-i-t-h right n-j-e-s-u-s brings the very headship of Christ down and that's where we have our opening scripture let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus because when that cloud came down brother Benham said it was in the shape of a pyramid and what did it represent the very headship and mind of God was coming down we now have by God's grace a perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine vindication we have it the headship and the leadership of almighty God the Holy Spirit anointing us with this Holy Spirit leading Us by his will and his word and so that's where Philippians comes into view and as I look in the Philippians this is where I noticed there's a decision then there's the silence and then there's the sacrifice this is what I saw when I was out in Oregon now look at it if you will turn in your Bibles Philippians 2 5 we're just going to slow down for a moment and just look at this for a second because I believe we're predestinated to walk in these same footsteps and I think sometimes we want God to just magically change us like just just Lord just mold me over make me what you want me to be foreign but you have there's a process to an adoption there's lessons that you've got to learn there's decisions you have to make there's there's there's sacrifices you have to make there's a there's a process of making yourself of no reputation there's a humbling of oneself it is not just being able to repeat what God has said it's being able to walk in his footsteps I believe the bride walks in his footsteps with him that's why as my subtitle to my title is follow me follow me and that's where if we look here it says let now that word let means allow you have to let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus that means you have to push away your mind to let his mind come into view you have something you have to do you got a decision you got to make you have to seek his will you have to seek his faith say Lord is this your will or is this my will you know often and I was I was with Cali last night and I was talking I had to repent to my daughter and I literally repented her and I said I apologize 90 of the time when this family prays we're asking for God to do something for us ninety percent of the time we're saying Lord ah I need you to heal my body Lord I need you to fix the situation at work Lord I need you to bless this food it's full of poison it's going to kill us if we don't if you don't sanctify and bless it you know what I'm saying Lord do this for me Lord do that for me Lord solve this problem Lord fix that person Lord I don't like this situation Lord deliver me from this one I've been wrong that's not how we're supposed to pray brother Branham said we don't pray to change God's mind we should be praying to change us to fit his mind and his will we pray wrong we're still showing our immaturity we're still speaking like children we should be saying Lord let me learn what you need me to learn Lord open my eyes to see how I should respond to that boss how I should respond to that person how should I be Lord in this situation Lord am I not seeing something should should I make a sacrifice should I cut something off should I turn down the overtime what do I do father amen there's no more crying out for the will of God in our lives we sit back say all is under control no no hold on God's working to restore a spiritual relationship between God and man where we can hear from God and be led of a spirit and actually know his will because the Bible brother bam said the bride will know his will she'll have thus saith the Lord or she stays silent she doesn't make a move she sits still we see this let you must make a decision to allow the will of God to have the preeminence in your life or not and I'm telling you God will bless you in either one that's what's so deceiving that's shocking I don't want to be blessed in doing something that's contrary to the will of God I truly don't remember brother Benham talks about that he says uh the false anointed ones he says we're getting results aren't we that's their excuse God's blessing what we do don't he but it's contrary to his will contrary to his word it's no sign that God's blessing it there's no sign that God's pleased and what you're doing it's okay we're just talking down to earth okay aside when we be so quiet I'm sorry like I'm talking to me remember I'm listening too I'm I'm tuned in and so who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God this is unique because under the unveiling of Christ in this day we find out who we were yes yes we found we're part of God we found I'm bone of his bone life of his life flesh of his flesh there's something in the soul that came from God and it's going to go back to God and then not Jesus said don't they call them gods don't you not call them Gods whom the word of God comes to news flash your gods your sons and daughters of God manifested attributes of his thinking on this Earth to display Christ to the world so we're not it's not wrong for us to make ourselves equal with God but that's why I preach that one sermon on ascension by condescension or descension because if you look here when God's manifested in flesh he doesn't exalt himself he abases himself that's what's so a problem look at me I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ get out of my way I don't have time for you serpency nonsense can't stand that attitude get out of the way devil hey don't disregard a worthy opponent brother bam said God made himself a worthy opponent you're disregarding him and treat him like he's not a worthy opponent yeah come on now but you see that attitude it's just not right it's not the right attitude because I see this son He makes himself of no reputation he being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal but he made himself no reputation I'm not making myself big I'm making myself little took upon himself the form of a servant not a leader not one that said hey everybody sit down listen to me no Jesus didn't do that Jesus was a servant he was doing everything he could to help everybody he could that all the time see the attitude of a son of God how can I help you that's why brother Bama that quote there it just really shook me to my core this one objective I have is to see his true spiritual relationship between God and man restore that's my objective that was his objective I think we need to reframe why we're living here for a moment we're not living on this Earth to just have a comfortable life we should be living every day saying Lord I'm working I'm going to do my part to restore and take one step closer to you because I know there's a promise in the word it says if I draw an eye to you you'll draw an eye to me and while I'm living and drawing 92 I'm going to do something I can wherever I can with whomever I can to help them get a little closer to you I don't know who they are I don't know if they're bride not bride foolish version what does it matter they're human beings Christ died for him do something for somebody at all times you don't know who they are and you don't know why God allowed them in your life we get the wrong attitude about being the son of God get the wrong arrogancy there's no arrogancy you look at Jesus Christ he constantly abased himself Josephus said he didn't even raise his voice when he preached he talked quietly he just talked to the people it's just really struck me I was laying in bed last night I said how what did he do when he walked up to the disciples like think of this guys these are full-grown men working every day working hard these are men fishermen and tax collectors and Jesus little man not good looking there's no beauty that we should be holding it's just simple didn't use good words just talked in common everyday language walks up to a man looks at him follow me yeah and walks off and that full-grown man shuts his books drops his Nets leaves everything and follows him what sermon did he preaching what was said what happened my what kind of atmosphere was created Around Jesus Christ that when a man would even look at him and be in his presence he was willing to forsake all and come follow him and then we need almost an angel to come get us to do anything to draw close to God you know what I'm saying it's like just the very presence his presence and the Simplicity of his word ought to be enough for us to say drop in my net shutting my book pushing that over time away adios amigos you can have it all I want to be in the presence of God I'm leaving here soon this is a trip I gotta unpack for so I gotta get ready you see what that was it's so unique to me how he could just say follow me and you know what I believe he's doing I believe he's saying it again amen drop your nets shut the book turn off the cell phone I'm here follow me oh we got a lot of distractions everyone devil is good at his job people out there yelling the devil's no match mean you're spending four hours on the phone you just consume it yeah right Devil's no match for you uh-huh cannot get off of social media I'm not picking them but you know what I'm saying he's just whistling through the graveyard you're just bluffing God don't I mean devil don't care what you say he wants to see a life a voice of a thousand lived lives that's the Thunder that shakes the enemy I don't care what you say show me a life that's creating an atmosphere around it that the very presence of God is with you wherever you go stop telling me things show me that's the bride I believe she creates an atmosphere by what she's thinking about what she's consuming what she's reading the things that she's showing her desires for she's showing their desire for work she's showing their desire to be popular or is she Desiring to be in the presence of God I don't know it sounds like psalms 27 one thing have I desired of the Lord that I might dwell in the presence of God that's the desire of the Bride him yes amen I really could care less about formalities just so you know I don't come to church just to come to church and do my religious Duty I come to church I can draw close to God if he's got to cut me shape me make me whatever he needs me to be father God don't let me stay the way I am you've got to get me closer to you am I the only one that feels like Lord I need to be closer to you there's something burning in my heart something's got in the way between me and you I don't exactly even know what it is but there is something there and I'm going to do something about it I'm going to take an action and decision to push this stuff away and realize hold on this message came to bring me back into fellowship with God that I once had with you from before the foundation world where was I where was I brother Steve where were you like he asked job where were you come on we're not like other people I the grace of God in our life to show us who we are and what he's doing in this hour I haven't even got to my subject um okay so let's did I even finish the scripture no who being in the fashion of man who being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself God didn't humble him he chose this decision he himself humbled himself he abased himself he washed the disciples feet it's amazing to me he didn't fight to defend his position he didn't try to convince everyone that he was right he just spoke the word humbly walked you look at what God went through to make himself of no reputation he literally went out of his way to make sure he had no reputation he allowed himself to be born in a bad way that the whole society says have nothing to do with them that's a bastard child stay away so he's walking living growing up with all the kids saying leave him alone mom dad say don't play with that kid he's a bastard child you know he went through this stuff let's step back into his shoes for a second you know literally he didn't come God didn't even allow his form to be handsome beautiful articulate he wasn't articulate everybody he spoke common everyday language because the people wouldn't be attracted to anything carnal they were going to be attracted to the words that he spoke they knew that this man speaks not like any other man that has ever been spoken this man has the words of eternal life and never has a man spoke like this and I was thinking about you like you're he's living in an hour they didn't have social media they didn't have the sports and entertainment you know what they did for fun the Smart Ones God amongst them and they would give oratory speeches and stuff like that the great ones and here comes Jesus real simple common everyday man he didn't have a nice suit when he preached you know that he didn't have the greatest garments the greatest robes no had a common everyday Fisherman's outfit or just a common man suit you could say not a suit didn't have great words of wisdom wasn't wasn't handsome it's ugly and he wasn't even tall sorry brother Brian he wasn't even tall brother he's short like me they're shorter than me more than likely but you see there was nothing there was no reputation he made himself in no reputation literally did everything he could to destroy his reputation let himself be identified with a drinkers the Sinners and prostitutes sitting there drinking or not drinking but you know sitting there and fellowshipping with the out the drug or whatever so drug addicts the prostitutes and everything he wasn't ashamed to be identified with him what kind of man is this Prophet From Galilee and sometimes we won't even fellowship with a believer that has a different Doctrine [Music] sorry I'll bring it home can't have fellowship and they'll see the way I see it why sound like Jesus would do it huh no Jesus didn't do that brother bam didn't do that in fact brother man we're gonna draw you out of our Circle that's okay I'll draw you right back in we ain't gonna have no fellowship with you that's okay I'm bringing you back in brother I love you greatest weapon he gave love prayer and love conquer any enemy we better go I'm gonna get in trouble um everybody okay amen sorry we slowed it way down so let's look at decisions if we can we'll pick up this pattern here before that make sure I say this and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross the last portion is I want you to see there was first a decision he allowed the mind of Christ be in him you know brother banham said he was a man like you and me he could have had a wife he could have had a family he didn't have to do those things but he allowed it he led it he let the will of God become the primary purpose by which he was living and there's the question for all of you are you letting the will of God be the primary purpose and desire of your life where's your desires what's your purpose is it to see the will of God fulfilled and why he allowed me to come to earth or is it that I can have a most comfortable life possible and he humbled himself and he became obedient so you see the decision which led to silence he made himself a no reputation he didn't defend himself he didn't say Hey listen to me I got something to say no he stood like a lamb before a sheer's dumb he opened not his mouth then defend himself nor did he change the scene when he could have he had the power to do it but he didn't do it and then you see the last portion he himself became a sacrifice for somebody else and that's the pathway that I have seen as a pattern of an adopted son and I am not omnipotent and I am this is what I see I'm very much open to hearing what other people would see on this believe me I'm not one that says this is the answer no I this is what I see you show me of other things too but I certainly have seen these three patterns with an adopted son Jesus his decision was found in Mark 14 34 and say and saith unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death Terry ye here and watch and he went forward a little and he fell on the ground and he prayed that if it were possible that this hour might pass him and he said Abba Father all things are possible uh take away this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine will be done had a decision to make he allowed the will of the father to be his decision though he himself didn't want to pay that price but he submitted himself to the will of God and now we also seen it also displayed in John 17 19. it says and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also may be Sanctified through thy truth so you see Jesus made a decision to sanctify himself for the father and for others the only way I can express my love to God how am I treating and loving others bible say that you'll find there's always a parallel anytime you're going to bring in an affection for God you're going to find it being expressed to a people every time I've not seen it fail look at the Ten Commandments honor thy father and thy mother covet not thy neighbor's wife you see all this have no other God before thee okay so first portion have no other God before thee keep those Commandments that keep me in line with you and treat your brother don't treat your brother wrong don't cover the brother's wife don't do you know you notice that everybody notice that first here and then here you notice so then as parallels in the Book of Joshua the decision is found in Joshua 1 6 and I should have made a PowerPoint but we'll just go through this Joshua 1 6 the decision it says and they answered Joshua saying all that thou commandest us we will do and withersoever thou sendeth us we will go according as he as we hearken unto Moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only the Lord thy God be with thee as he was with Moses so before they go into the promised land they as a people are saying we will do what you tell us to do we will obey you in all that you say Joshua being the type of the Holy Ghost he's taking them into their promised land and going to positionally place them soon then we look at brother Branham his decision we know this one 1963 standing in the Gap Victor Leduc a full-blooded Frenchman born-again Christian filled with the Holy Spirit gave his address he wrote it down he said Danny uh but prophecy said over brother Branham given to Danny Henry on February 11 1961. at the Full Gospel businessmans now here's what it said because thou has chosen the narrow way the harder way that has walked in thine own choosing now I can see that because Moses made his choice thou has picked the correct and precise a precise and correct way and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision that thou has made this in and of itself will make him come to bring to pass a tremendous Victory and love divine for the Phantom had to make a choice before he could come to a cloud and an adopted son that God could have so much confidence in him that he could go back and preach the Seven Seals because he knew he would only say what the father wanted him to say he first had to come to a point of decision where he wasn't looking for the easy way out he was looking to do just what God Said which was usually found in the harder way so there's a great great great great great way for us to actually identify the decisions we make nine times out of ten I don't think it's the easy way don't think it's the easy way I think it's going to cost you I think the decisions that express our sonship and are coming to adoption is choosing heart of path it's just choosing the harder path it's loving the unlovely it's not reviling or it's not fighting back when reviled against it's not fighting when rejected this is choosing the harder way so brother branham's Choice came into view so we had Jesus's Choice come into view but the branham's choice comes into view now we'll see what brother Branham said about the bride he said in 1965 in leadership sometimes in life you have to confront a thing just like a young this young man did because you are a mortal being and it and God has given you the opportunity to make a choice you have a choice God made you in such a way that you can have a choice if he had put Adam and Eve if he put Adam and Eve on free moral agency so that they could choose and then they made the wrong choice and see he can do no more to you than he did to them he's got to put you the same way that he uh same he's got to put you the same thing so you can choose it or reject it you're making your choice okay understand sorry I got confused in the words and so you see the pattern first decision okay let's move to silence and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on silence because I preached that one here the second one was adoption into the silence and Jesus in Isaiah 53 he opened not his he was oppressed and Afflicted and he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb before the slaughter and a sheep before his shears is done so he opened not his mouth Jesus in silence John 5 19 then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son of man can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever things he seeth for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise so he didn't do anything except the father showed him what to do he went to the pool of Bethesda he had the power to heal everybody but he went to one man that the father showed him to go to do and he healed that one man that's it God's not vindicating you because the abundance of things that you're doing for him he's going to actually say that's my son because you did the one thing he wanted you to do for him you see it's not in the abundance of things we do are you doing the thing he wanted you to do maybe one thing you know he says about John the Baptist he let that man grow 30 years you know learning for a six-month Ministry one thing he had to do just that one thing do that one thing it's like it's like the great Symphony right you know you ever see those got the guy he can't play any musical instruments so he holds those big uh Circle brass things you know they give that guy the guy who has no music without that be me they give him one job okay there's going to be a note coming and when that note comes you ding those things together right you see so he's got a job the symphony has him play his part we got a spot we got a place to play we may not have the gift to play a violin or play the we got to maybe just hit those what are those called symbols see I know nothing about music nothing horrible but we got one part to play and I gotta hit those symbols at just that right time and that may be the one thing God wants you to do that's just one thing just do that one thing usually though it's the hardest thing to do yes yes we'll justify everything else is we're serving God because we're doing this we're going to church we're paying our tithes we're we're you know what I'm saying we're doing everything right religiously but you're not doing that one thing he showed you to do that one thing there's one and you know what it is usually sometimes there's just one thing down in your heart you're refusing to do and you're trying to cover it up you're trying to cover up your religious walk with God you know you're not in not in fellowship with God because there's that one thing that one thing that's keeping you separated from it you're not making that one step having that one conversation not making that one choice that will bring you back into his presence so you just go real fast and run to church and do stay busy and stay in Fellowship but you don't do that one thing it's Unique that that's striking me I kind of feel funny about it that one thing that one thing may be keeping you from his presence do that one thing um so and Mark it says Mark 14 he said oh no now let's go to the parallel of Joshua this silence I'm getting nervous because it's already 8 20. so parallel Joshua 6 10. let's see this silence in action and Joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your mouth neither shall any word proceed from your mouth until the day that I bid you shout then ye shout Joshua the type of the Holy Ghost having headship and Leadership and dominion over his lead over the people saying don't speak until I tell you to speak is that what he said now we follow it back down into six six Joshua 6 16 and it came to pass that at the seventh time when the priest blew the Trump Rich Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord hath given Thee the city now it was time for them to speak so they learned when to be silent and they learned no when to speak Amen to not make that decision not do that thing and then they knew okay now it's time to do that thing there's a pattern if you notice there's a pattern popping out he wants you to walk with him amen not separated from you know your own little journey through life no follow me come follow me I've got a path stick close to me I'll take you so Joshua 6 20 and so the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the walls fell flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city there's your silence paralleling in the Book of Joshua now let's bring it into brother Branham brother Branham had his moment of silence too he says in 1961 Abraham and his seed after him a man met me the other night brother Branham if you'll just compromise this great man in the Full Gospel Church will will take and furnish an airplane if you'll join our organization and you'll and we'll take you with this gift to every major city in the world and blast this thing forth if you'll just compromise a little bit on what you're teaching oh just a little compromise just say something a little bit more than what God wanted you to do he said I he said I said you with a doctor's degree would ask a servant of God to compromise on the word of God I can't even think of such a thing as that man I said no sir there's no compromise in me at all I said I believe God's word teaches the coming of the Lord or the coming of the Son of God I believe in the baptism Holy Spirit I believe in the signs and wonders following the Believers that's exactly what God Said and that's what I stand by I like that is that the attitude of you guys that's what God said I'm standing with it I don't care what the devil would say anything contrary to the word of God get out of here what's wrong with you man I like brother Brandon's attitude what's wrong with you man doctor's degree you compromise on the word of God nah now if the bride has the same attitude now the pergamian church age those in the bride only do his will no one can make them do otherwise oh we'll make you a popular person you know no they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing these Works fulfilling his word he did not complete all his work while he was in this earthy Ministry so now he works in and through his bride dropping down to the next one he says now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming into sight even as it did theirs now Joshua means Jehovah's savior he represents that end time leader that'll come to the church even as Paul came to the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true to Joshua remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word but see they wanted something different so did this last day Church such a pressure to compromise just a pressure to let things in that wouldn't be pleasing to God into our lives into our churches into our homes that you know is not pleasing to God but this is a little compromise does it really mean that much does it mean having the presence of God in your home I don't know you answer the question is that little compromise costing you a relationship with him costing you his presence having the uh having him feel welcome in your home you know that little compromise you know that little thing that video you know that little thing that you know you got to hide it every time a Believer comes to your house you know just little things little compromises it's little compromises no we say no it's the word of God or nothing I'll be militant about that one that's a German inside me no it's the word or nothing and so now let's look to sacrifice now this is the one that I kind of honed in on and uh this is the one that it means a lot to me right now personally as well because I find myself in the same path John here's Jesus's sacrifice John 10 17. therefore Duff my father loved me because I laid down my life that I may take it up again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down I have power to take it up again this commandment have I received of my father you see no man took his life he freely by his free choice laid his life down you know what you make your own choice you either surrender you'll either be crucified you either be rejected you either be destroyed for other sake this is the path we get to choose everyone because I do believe that's part of it I believe my will gets destroyed in the process of his will taking preeminence now in Isaiah it says it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put on him grief when he shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see a seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and May and was made an intercessor for the transgressors by his own free choice you know a father does that with a family a father will die so his family could live you know you go to work you destroy your body so the family can be provided for that's what a father does right you know the scripture we have ten thousand instructors and few fathers the Bible says that and there's an element to that that really resonates to me because you can have someone that tells you what to do you can have someone else that'll intercede on you and pay a price for you to do it you know someone that'll go to prayer for you someone that will really sacrifice for you not many will do that many people tell you what to do but if it requires them to do something for you ah it takes effort that takes sacrifice humans don't want to sacrifice we want the easier way we do it's our nature we avoid pain at all costs that's just the reality of your carnal flesh but the soul does his will and his will is that you would die in sacrifice and pay a price for your brother do something for somebody else intercede for someone else lose some sleep at night I lost some sleep to come here tonight but I did it because I want to be a blessing that's okay with me I know it's either brother Chandler to talk about it's like every time we go to preach it's like so difficult to preach why I had a horrible day yesterday I wanted to be home and spend the whole day in prayer and I had a big problem in the morning and a bigger problem in the afternoon it was horrible day and like why is it always like this every time I get asked to preach I know it's going to be hard it's always hard and honestly I want to say no like I really selfishly I want to talk about his head sorry brother busy can't do it right now because every time it's tough every single time I'm either sick I don't sleep problems at work something goes wrong every time now then I got a conscious choice to make don't I now I know I'm gonna if I say yes if I tell brother Chad sure I'll go I know it's coming Brother Rich asked me to come out to Oregon I had a head cold five days before I go and you ever fly on an airplane with a splitting head cold you know and the pressure on it coming down out to my ear is ringing and I lost Hearing in my ear which was messing with my equilibrium which was making me dizzy right brother Wesley and I I it was wild I'm like every time go to the Philippines sick go sometimes he don't go with me and I go by myself and then I'm really really really sick you know it's horrible why is preaching so difficult like why why why is it always like this I think it's part of something I'm learning I think it's part of something that God's showing me in all of it what price am I willing to pay for somebody else for someone else to be helped for someone else to be blessed to maybe if I have to go through suffering so that God could say just one word that helps you then it's okay I think brother Branham said I would push a a nickel if I knew it this would help me I'd push a Nick or a penny around the whole city if I knew it would help you you see the attitude of a son of God man he would do anything to help you you didn't care who you were didn't care if you were a bride didn't matter I'd do anything I could to help you make your burden a little lighter upon this Earth because life's hard I get it life's difficult I got a lot of sympathy for people and this day my goodness people are losing their minds and you can see why what hope do they have like do you fault a person for going on drugs and drinking themselves what hope do they have stop condemning people they're just trying to satisfy their nerves so they don't lose their minds in this crazy world you know I don't know why I just have a sympathy because I realize yeah without Christ I mean I get it I get it I totally see why you throw yourself into this thing and this thing and this thing and this thing it's because you don't have Christ but I promise you one thing you get Christ you won't thirst that stuff no more I promise you that I promise you brother Branham said something I was speaking to the youth he said it was your faith that lifted you up out of those things it was your faith so many times well God Lifted Me Up out of it no it was your faith in the word that lifted you up out of that God placed something inside of you that could say Amen to the word and you believed it and God like dropped a ladder down into where you were in the mud and the muck and the filth of life and it's like a ladder and you just take a step of faith on that ladder and just wow where am I going you're just climbing out of it you get into the depths of depression I promise you start believing the word you're going to climb out of it you get sorrowful you get weary you get sick I promise you put your faith back in the promise of God he's going to drop like a ladder down to you start climbing yourself out of it it's not rocket science right it's just have faith in God he's provided everything we have need up for this Earthly Journey you just got to believe it Stop Believing the devil's lies it's a lie anything contrary to the word of God I don't care how convincing it is I don't care how much your mind reasons with and says that's the truth it's a lie not made to live this life using this does the Bible say God took a man's mind head God took to God's devil took a man's mind God took his heart seed of faith is right down inside of there say that's the truth I believe it amen and just climb right on out of it don't let nothing get in your way I think brother Ben said just cut your way through every bit of it that's what we do with the word but it's faith in the word why did the word not profit them it was never mixed with faith why is the word not profiting you you're not believing it right you don't want to blame so many people about so many problems maybe you don't believe the word maybe you have more confidence in the Natural Things of life in politics or things of that nature and you have no confidence in the word my goodness man stop consuming the nonsense and start getting back into the word faith comes by hearing the words to start reading the word feeding on the word and see what happens it has a way of stirring you back up again I lost my place where did I go Isaiah okay Jesus Jesus is sacrificed now parallel and Joshua now this is the one that's interesting now the parallel in Joshua I found to be in a little story of a man named Aiken and we'll read it for a second because this man was willing to sacrifice the wrong thing he was willing to sacrifice the word he was willing to sacrifice the presence of God for something carnal and look at what happened Joshua 7 20 and Aiken answered Joshua and said indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel and thus and thus have I done when I saw Among The Spoils of the goodly Babylonian garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold and 50 shekels of weight then I coveted them and I took them and behold they are hidden the Earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it and Joshua and all of Israel with him took Aiken and the son of the son of Zariah zura and the silver and the Garment and the gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and he brought them into the valley of acor and Joshua said why hast thou troubled us the Lord shall trouble thee this day and all of Israel stoned him as stones and burned them with fire and they were stoned and they had stoned them with stones after they had stoned them with stones this man named Aiken was not willing to sacrifice his Lust For carnal things for having the presence of God lead him he was willing to sacrifice the presence and the leadership of God not only for him his life but for his home and for 36 other Israelites that died because one man wouldn't make a sacrifice the reality of it is a father to a home if you're not willing to pay a price for your family you don't pay the price you and your family pay a price so many times we think that our decisions are isolated to ourself no it ain't I'm sorry it's just not it's not your lack of making a sacrifice for your for the your family affects them and also us affects this whole church a lack of laying your will down the lack of laying your own ideas down a lack of saying Lord you know what I'm saying and make it real for a second if you don't make a sacrifice someone else is going to pay a price along with you it's never just you it's never isolated to just you there's someone else that'll suffer too and so looking at brother Branham he preaches a sermon called standing in the gap and you get to see a sacrifice that he had to make you know he got tired of being rejected tired of being constantly he'd preach with all his heart all his soul bring the truth to him and he was constantly rejecting he started getting the complex towards the people and brother by Adam even admits he's like I wanted to leave I wanted to run off to the wilderness I couldn't take it no more I couldn't take it I I just I lost my feeling for the people if I've lost the feeling for the people you can't help nobody if you don't have feeling for someone you can't help them I promise you you can't help them brother ma'am said the secret of my Ministry is I could sympathize with the person step into his shoes understanding sympathize with how he may be feeling or what he's going through that was the secret to his ministry and so brother Branham and standing in the Gap he was going to leave he's going to say I'm done with this people I'm angry I'm upset with the people I don't want to do this no more but God showed him if you go that way and ain't going to end so good for you and then he brought to his review the other people that would suffer because he doesn't take that stand I got something for you aren't you glad he came back aren't you glad that he was willing to pay a price aren't you glad that he was willing to not compromise on the word of God to say just what the word of God said to be faithful in his decisions to not choose the easier way but to choose the harder way aren't you thankful that he could be given millions of dollars and say hey we can make you the most popular man on Earth we could fly you around on the Jets and he said no if it causes me to have to compromise the Lord of God I won't take that way I'm so glad that God had a man that was willing to pay that kind of a price to be that kind of a man that would stand upon the word of God regardless of what man thought even said when I go to preach these things I'm going to lose thousands and thousands of my friends but for the will of God amen and for the purity of the Gospel knowing that God is preparing the people I did it for you and me yeah man that's interesting so there was a purpose in it brother bam says in standing in the gap he said I let the sick lay I want the Lord I want the Lord to let to tell me where to go and what not to do that was wrong I had built myself up a complex because the people didn't hear my message and if you and God forbid that I ever try to compare my life now with Moses but it's exactly what Moses did and the people wouldn't listen to him and he'd come down into to deliver them so he just left them alone and went into the Wilderness but God turned him around and he had a lot he had a long forgot for because he had long forgotten the suffering people so the reality of it is we gotta we gotta be willing to do this for somebody else not just for ourselves sometimes you have to choose a harder way and pay a great price for somebody else not for you I think it is in the it's not the Marines the Navy Seals I believe it is they they put them in groups together because it's easy for a Navy SEAL when they're going to training to just want to give up if they're the only one that has to pay the price but actually what they'll do is I think they'll tie them together they join them with other people because they found out that you're willing to endure a lot more when you know somebody else is going to suffer if you don't make that decision or you don't stand in there that's how they train those Navy Seals and the reality of it is you can endure a lot more if you know this ain't just about you everyone this is about all of us this is about your family this is about your children this is about your wife this is about your extended family this is about your co-workers this is about everything around you you're a little God that has been placed in a little atmosphere that you come in contact with a little world of people around you each and every day and they have to they you've got a purpose in being there you've got a purpose in your job you got a purpose where where you're living where you're expressing Christ to this world there's a purpose behind it and so I've got to be willing to sanctify myself and make some harder decisions because there's somebody else counting on me somebody else counting on me and so now the bride Luke 9 23 and we'll wrap it up quick here just hit this portion it says in Luke 9 23 and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life will lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it my opening scripture because I still believe if I'm going to follow him I'm going to have to pick up a cross and if I can't find a cross then I'm probably not walking the right path I must be on the wrong path if I can't identify what cross I'm actually picking up daily it's Unique this is a daily cross I gotta pick up but maybe I'm on the wrong path because I can't seem to find the cross Romans 8 35 who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation distress or persecution famine nakedness Peril or sword it is written for thy sake we are killed all day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us do you realize he's calling those that are willing to be killed and slayed for the gospel's sake conquerors there's your conquerors there's your Mighty bride of Jesus Christ the ones that's willing to die for his brother and one that's willing to pay whatever price necessary to help someone else there's your true conquerors you know God hides things in such Simplicity we think it's going to be great big wonderful watch this and watch that you'll find a bride that just simply humbly walking according to his word doing the one thing that he wants you to do here the one thing he wants you to do there just obedient and faithful to do the father's will that's it just a real simple humble life I think brother Branham said live a simple humble life and God wants you to do something he'll show you what to do and then do that one thing don't try to do something more just do what he called you to do and Shalom he says suffering for the namesake is Growing Pains of his grace suffering for his word see is just the Growing Pains of his grace yes sir just remember it's the grace of God that was given unto you we're in the growing pain stage guys ever have them growing pains in the middle of the night when you're a kid can't do anything about it you're going to get them they hurt you got to go through it this is all this adoption part it's just the Growing Pains of his grace the difficulties that we incur the situations amongst churches Growing Pains of his grace I'm convinced more and more each and every day that God has allowed certain things to come our way as individuals us as the people and as a fellowship of Believers and that to a bride as a whole because it's time for the maturing of the Bride he's going to increase the sunlight he's going to check the motives and the objectives of your heart the purpose of your desires why you do everything you do why you make the decisions that you make why you can't seem to just stay with what he wants you to do and what price are you willing to pay for one another I believe that's an adopted son yes I believe that's what we're going to see come into view bam says Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal his hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it away from you you let your job you let your wife let your husband you let your children you let the cares of this world you let some Pastor you let somebody get that out of you when you do that way down in your heart you're thirsting you're hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you it's see it's a revelation for the last day is here I'm thirsting everyone I hope I'm not the only one thirsting I'm thirsting and now I'm looking at my life and saying now really what needs to be done what needs to be done I think he's got to change our harder motive and objective it's not just knowing the right thing it's actually becoming being conformed in the image of his dear son it's the time for that conforming it's the time to be crushed it's the time to analyze the decision it's the time to look at their purpose in life it's a time for those things and then it's a time for us to know when to be quiet and there's a time to know when to speak following the headship of the Holy Ghost leadership by his word just doing what he wants us to do and then not doing anything that he doesn't want us to do where you stand musicians where you come hope that's okay it was a little slow for me tonight I'm sorry I should have drank a cup of coffee before I came up to the pulpit hey man I had this quote I liked it just struck me last night when I was thinking this follow me I don't know if it fits but I just left it in here remember when brother Brandon was walking through the woods and a voice said you want to walk with me remember that it just kind of struck me I was laying there in bed and it really I I have a hard time reading this he said I was I stood there watching and they got closer and closer and they turned and walked out into the woods and I just stood there just dumbfounded because you remember he had the opportunity he could have killed three deer boom boom boom he said one for a brother this brother one for this brother and one for this brother they had asked him you know and brother Branham remember he had a complex he loved to be loved because he was rejected as a kid he was totally rejected I mean bad name Born Under a Bad Name totally suffered a complex and he really loved to be loved he wanted to be loved who doesn't we all do and he thought you know what I could get one for that one and that one and that brother I'll be a real hero when I come back to the camp you know he said but I made God a promise he didn't like that and I made God a promise I wouldn't do that no more it's interesting he said I went and then I went away and the voice spoke again that Sean was the Sun was shining on my back it said you remembered your promise didn't you I don't know why that struck me so like it did last night it's like God was taken aback he was like shocked oh you did that of your own free will you did something that pleased me and I didn't force you to do it I wasn't going to punish you if you didn't I was the poor wrath and lightning wasn't going to come out a voice wasn't going to scream you broke your promise no God was like wow you remembered your promise to me you didn't forget about me and you know sometimes we know God won't forget about us but I wonder if God sometimes sits back and say did they forget about me did they forget about me they only ever call on me when I need they need me to do something for him that's the only time I hear them pray anymore it's when they need something from me rather than hey Lord I just want to spend some time with you I'd like to know if there's anything you need me to do today who prays like that that's why I had to repent to my daughter I said I've been praying wrong as a family we pray wrong I'm sorry I apologize I can't remember the last time where I said I gather the family around I said Lord let's pray as a family to find the will of God for what we're supposed to be doing right now Lord search our hearts as a family and say Lord where do you need me to be what do you need me to do is there any place I need to go someone I need to talk to is there someone I need to help or anything I can do for you you know what I'm saying it's like God was shocked he remembered his promise to me said yes Lord I remembered my promise and I know that's you I can't see you Lord but you're here somewhere I said I don't see you but I can hear your voice and I know that's you said you kept your promise you remembered your promise and I'll remember mine too I'll never leave you and I will never forsake you oh my I haven't felt the same ever since I came off that mountain all that afternoon Vision after Vision taking place I come down it seemed like everything was different has been different since then the burden is all gone amen my goodness I don't know why it's just that really really strikes me can we just bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we stand at times at myself Lord I stand a little bit ashamed father that you could do so much be so much for us show us so much truth work in our lives in such Supernatural ways and then we can forget about you I can forget about you so easily the busyness of Life the cares of life Lord it just has a way of sometimes causing us to just drift and Lord I don't want to drift I don't think anybody in here wants to be drifting Lord I want to be found in such a way that I'm purposely purposeful living my life with a Divine Purpose to see to it that I come back into a place in a position that I had with you from before the foundational world and I don't want nothing to take it away from me I don't want to problem a situation at work a situation with a person nothing nothing Lord to hinder me from walking with you father forgive me as an individual forgive us as a people if this is for anybody other than me forgive us father Lord don't let us be such a selfish people Lord that we are only calling upon you when we need you to do something may we have an attitude like a bride like a wife to a husband she's there to serve her husband may this bride be found serving your purpose your will your desire longing every day to know your heart's desire which we know is your word but Lord being sensitive enough to your Holy Spirit to find how we can accomplish that each and every day in this everyday living that we live father we just love you we thank you for your word I'm thankful Lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever I'm thankful Lord that you speak to the Simplicity of your word Lord it can be so simple for me it just it's like simple but yet father God it's such a reality to me now Lord I just pray that you'd help us Lord anoint us forgive us Lord we repent we don't just say we're sorry we're turning away from this kind of a lifestyle and an attitude and a mindset and father that we can draw closer to you Lord we love you we commit ourselves to you father search our hearts Lord may we make a conscious effort to push keep this world at a distance keep the cares of this life and the problems of this life at a distance because there's no room for that in our lives because we're close to you fill that Gap Lord with your presence Lord we love you we thank you we thank you for the opportunity you gave us tonight to be able to break away from the busyness of life and come to church and Lord we're thankful for your revealed word and Lord we're thankful for a prophet that never compromised Lord we love you we thank you may we be found as a bride that never compromises to in Jesus name amen amen you have a song brother what you got you amen only to be one he wants me to be every moment of every day [Applause] yielded completely to Jesus alone every step of this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ready to do what is [Music] [Music] please amen how many appreciated the word oh were you challenged by it corrected by it inspired by it amen the word can do all of it in the same sermon amen oh I thank God that this path that that Brother Kyle was talking about with decision and silence and sacrifice we get new opportunities every day for decisions and opportunities to be signed and opportunities to lay down our lives and I believe we're going to continue to get those until we get this lesson right that we learn what God wants us to do amen I think we're learning that to be an overcomer I'm going to have to overcome myself and to be a conqueror I'm going to have to conquer self because the great mystery of God was unfolded in three folds first to get preeminence in a man God didn't take that preeminence preeminence was willingly given second is to get preeminence in a people he's doing that now but God's not coming and taking God's receiving what's given to him and we're learning to give him preeminence in our decisions in our speaking or not speaking in our self and that last quote that Brother Kyle read it reminded me instantly of something brother Bob shared with me and I believe if I hope I don't get the story wrong because sometimes I get them wrong but I believe it was something that brother Branham had said to brother Lee Vale and he said brother Lee have you ever done something for God just for God all right think about that that's what the last quote was about have you ever done anything for God just for God not so that you would have a neat testimony to share with somebody later not so that you could get credit for making the right decision Sometimes When We Share testimonies is so we can look good if we just be honest have we ever privately in the privacy of Our Own Heart have we ever done something for God just only for God something that will never be mentioned something that will never be known something will never be seen but just because we loved him all right that's what I want to do yes I want to know what pleases him and I want to do it just for him and I want with all that in me to have no ulterior motive and sometimes I get so frustrated I find ulterior motives and I hate it but I want to get to the place where I just love him because he first loved me amen think that's what he wants I think that's what we want but thank God that's what he's growing us into everything he's been teaching us everything we've been going through it's all pointing the same thing this is what we're coming to friends where we learn to surrender self and let him have preeminence where we do what we do because we love him why do we love him because he first loved me oh I'm grateful for the word so grateful for the opportunity you know this is not an easy life and this is not an easy age to live in I'm so thankful he put me here so I can express my love to him I'm so thankful I have opportunities to express my love to him and that's my desire to express my love amen may God help each one of us and may God be glorified and all that we say amen God bless you brother girl it's good to see you here didn't know you were coming up but God bless you it's good to have you and your wife with us and I'm going to ask brother Manuel brother man will you come up and just say hi to everybody and dismiss us with the word of prayer I think it'd be good just to hear our brother's voice I mean we heard it in the amen but we'll hear it again amen God bless you brother Emmanuel it's good to have you [Music] I bless you all greetings I have a special greetings for thousands tens of thousands of Believers I have sent their greetings to you to our pastor to the congregation and it's just so good to be home meeting home this home here this is not brother Chad's home this is not my home it's God's house and it's our home and this evening [Music] I'm just so grateful that the Holy Spirit can speak in such simplicity what we just heard right now it's just Thunders but just in like a little feather but Thunders being inside and we we are we are resting on that it's have a word of prayer together precious loving father [Music] you are still God and Lord we're standing here knowing that what it only took you to strip yourself from your deity to come to take us from the the depth of sin and darkness we were in Lord you could have done it in a moment to strip yourself down but it would be so tremendous so miraculous that men would not even get around but you took time to condescend yourself and to come so near us is the prophet of God said that you're so closer to us and our even elbow is about our body and as you speak to us father day in and day out you just spoke again you're here we don't have to look for something that would catch our eyes we know you're here in your word we have heard you you're here you have not left [Music] and father just pray that as we came in at each and every one of us who would take this as the grandest opportunity if we came in with a little Grudge in our heart we have no reason to take it back home if we came in with a little sickness we were doubting that we can get healed over that sickness we have no reason to take it back home we can only take back home one one thing your word that you said it father it settled you spoke to me this evening you are here why would I take glory and pain suffering bitterness home with me father we just love you you're here Lord in we are going home taking nothing else but your word what we heard your word is you Lord each and every one of us tonight we're taking this as the grandest opportunity ever even if there's no tomorrow tonight we have that greatness opportunity to take you home with us [Music] you gave us yourself tonight Lord forgive us all of our Justice childish things Lord make us grow and we thank you for again give us an opportunity Lord if you have more days for us to gather that we will see your glory again father being manifested on each and every one of us thank you Lord for speaking to us thanks for your home you are faithful you have come as you draw draw a snail or we we heard you and now father we're going back home with you we love you in Jesus Christ then we pray amen [Music] amen it just feels good to have brother Emmanuel back in the sanctuary amen there's always something missing when when each one is gone amen I just want to encourage you I believe by the grace of God if there is a tomorrow each one of us will have an opportunity to practice what we heard for each tonight that's not one of those things we have to wait very long for an opportunity and I just want to recognize it when it comes and not miss it this time I say oh that's my opportunity to show God I love him that's my opportunity to deny myself I say God help me not to miss my opportunities and they may come before we get out of bed but praise God I want God to know I love him and I want to do what I can amen God bless you as you dismissed brother John let's sing only to be what what he wants me every moment every day [Music] to Jesus alone every step of is [Music] ready to do what his word coming to be one he wants me to be every moment of every day and I'm learning [Music] [Music] on Jesus and finding more power than I am ever dreamed I learning Journey on Jesus I found peace foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh I'm learning to leave I'm learning I'm learning to foreign [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music]
