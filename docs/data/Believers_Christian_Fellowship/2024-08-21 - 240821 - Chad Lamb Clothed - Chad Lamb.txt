something keeps holding me and I was on the way to church and she'd got some things out for supper and and I was eating just a pepper you know one of those little Peppers that you munch on and I was eating on it and I opened it up and there was no seeds on the inside side and I looked at it and I thought oh it's kind of like seedless watermelon and I was like they're just doing it and then you know just the words of eternal life just begin to play in my heart and I thought you know that's what I was that's what this is amen no way to bring forth life just looks good the pepper says I'm a pepper I look like a pepper I taste like a pepper but if you put it in the ground it can't bring forth eternal life and I'm so thankful that he saw me before the foundation of the world and he put a seed in there that had nothing to do with that old pepper skin on the outside but he put a seed that's going to bring forth one of these days and it just it just cheered my heart so I hope that wasn't maybe too out of the way for tonight but I'm so thankful that God just shows himself in those simple things you know just preparing for church and I said Thank you Lord for the seed that you put on the inside that there's no seed there that's going to reproduce life except for your seed amen so we love him so much much tonight amen the trials of this world were getting stronger oh the pool i f

the pull pit again it's been a a couple weeks for me amen and so I don't maybe I forgot how already brother BM said it's something you have to stick with so you got to stick with it so you don't forget let's turn with uh together in our Bibles to Isaiah 1 and as you turn I want to let you know that brother Benjamin seabolt's going to be traveling to Michigan to minister for brother Dan Ratliff this weekend so please remember him in prayer and as brother John mentioned uh just keep brother Emanuel and brother Bley Williams in your prayers as well and uh we should hear back from them here pretty soon I think they've got a another week just about another week to go unless they extended I haven't heard word yet that they're extending it so that's as far as I know also want to let you know that I know school's back in session and I'm mindful of that so I don't intend to go long on Wednesday night I know those little guys pretty tired and they got to get up early so just pull hard and fast hard and fast and then we'll see the way the Lord leads Isaiah uh 1:8 come now and let us reason together sayeth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool man God bless you may may have your seats like this scripture we we've known it for quite some time but the Lord is saying let us reason together sayith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool meaning that your your sins are going to be changed they're going to be converted from Crimson from red to White from Crimson to wool amen and there's a prophecy that's a promise that God is making and brother R when he refers to this scripture many times and he refers to it in this manner I'm going to read a quote to you from 1956 and many times he takes that scripture and he goes to this uh comparison and the message fellowship with God through reconciliation says and let me give you a little bit of scientific something you can take a red purely genuine red glass and look through it at a red object and red through red looks white figure it out God looking through the blood of Christ to a red sinner is white as snow though your sins be red like Crimson they shall be white like snow so the way brother R takes and interprets this scripture is he begins to show us that though your sins be red they shall be white as snow though they be like Crimson they shall be like wool and he's and he's telling us that it's not as though that the sin is going to be turned white but the sin is going to be covered with blood amen and red through red is white amen that's how brother R explains this many times several places in the message he goes on in the same quote he says God knew what he was doing when he looked through the blood of the innocent to the guilty that's bloody red and he sees him white not because he's righteous but because he's accepted the righteousness of God through Christ oh just let that soak in not because he's white not because he's become white amen we were born in sin shape and iniquity come into the world speaking Lies We were perverted from the beginning amen and and we come with a sinful nature we come in the wrong way amen but God Amen when he looks through the blood of the Lamb amen and he sees our Crimson spotted stains they're white as snow and so I want to read that again uh because it's important to the rest of what I want to say so I'm just going to repeat here God knew what he was doing when he looked through the blood of the innocent to the guilty that's bloody red and he sees him white not because he's righteous but because he's accepted the righteousness of God through Christ and become reconciled back to fellowship again with God not because something that you do some good deeds that's all right you do The Good Deeds because you're a Believer but that doesn't do it by Good Deeds joining church is all right but that isn't what does it it's when you recognize that you're a sinner lost and the only way that God can see you righteous is through the blood of Jesus Christ then when he sees you through the blood of Jesus he sees you as innocent as his own son Christ Jesus was that's the gospel story friend Simplicity that's the gospel story not that through Good Deeds or through good conduct or through uh uh applying yourself harder or through some wisdom or intellect that you can somehow convert your scarlet colored stains into something Snow White that's an impossibility that the efforts of man cannot do this amen and he says now you're white not because of your righteousness but you've accepted the righteousness of God through Jesus Christ amen and now he's looking at you through the blood filter and through the blood filter he can't see your Crimson stains because red and red looks White to him this is the fundamental basis of the Gospel amen if you would turn with me to Genesis chap 2 I just was meditating and thinking and and and it was like a it so often happens I don't know that I can accurately describe it or even explain it and doing so might be foolish but it's almost like a lightning bolt from Heaven all of a sudden just a flash of inspiration and Revelation and and then all of a sudden things that you've known all your life blossom into something entirely more beautiful than you've already been looking at not something new something that's the same I've told several people over the last couple days that by the time you're 10 years old you know everything you need to know about the message you know the message the message is man fell in the beginning he left God's word and he perverted himself and he's been corrupt ever since and God gave him a law because man couldn't accept his grace and he found out that he was an utter failure and the law exposed how much of a failure he was so Christ came to be the innocent lamb to stand in the place of a of a sinner who could never make himself right no matter how hard he tried but then then the gospel to the Gentiles and the Gentiles ruined it by adding their own intellect and understanding to it but at the end time God was going to bring us back to the full revelation of the full word and restore a bride and marry a bride and take her to glory and bring us back to Eden that's the whole message Friends by the time you're 10 years old growing up in the message you know everything you need and you know the whole message you know it amen but but if you live to be a 100 and you add 10 more decades to that 10y old amen you're never going to come to the end of discovering this message it's going to keep unfolding and keep growing and keep becoming more marvelous it's simple and deep it's it's it's it's easy and it's complex am it's beautiful beautiful so we're going to go back to the most simplest of stories and find that it's the whole gospel if we go to Genesis chap 2 and let's look at verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed man I would like just for a title just for a subject I would like to look at the title clothed the word clothed what does it mean to be clothed and we find here in the beginning that when God made man amen and he made him a help me he took from him and his wife and restored them back together and it says here very just very simply it says that uh they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed so technically they were uncovered amen but the prophet of God tells us that they were covered that they were veiled they had a veil they had a covering although there was no covering there was a covering he says in Satan's eeden this way he said compare this now how much alike that man and his wife both in God's Eden without one stitch of clothes on them and knew it not for why did they know why didn't they know it for they were veiled to their senses of nakedness by the holy veil of the Holy Spirit they could look right at each other and they didn't know that they were naked they were veiled with the Holy Spirit of Holiness they were veiled so they were naked but they were veiled amen praise the Lord a veil means a covering so they were naked and uncovered but yet they were covered and they were covered by the Holy Spirit why because they were obedient to the word they were standing behind the word and the Word was providing for them a covering again in Satan's eting he says notice now the Holy Spirit of God's holy word had a man and a woman naked and didn't know it how beautiful life of the word the seed the word God said there's a tree in the midst of the garden the woman and in the midst of the garden is this tree don't even touch it for the day you eat thereof that day you die they were wholly veiled from it didn't know nothing about it darest to touch it they were wholly veiled they were safe in God's Pavilion they were alive so as long as they stayed behind God's word they were covered they had a covering they had a holy Veil that veiled them to any sense of shame to any sense of nakedness to any lust of the flesh so as long as they stayed behind God's wall God's word God's Veil they themselves were covered they were veiled although Technic te Al we would say they were naked according to the scriptures but but we know that they were under a holy Veil so that's why there was no shame there was also no shame because they were under a veil of innocency yeah because they hadn't violated any word they were never out from behind God's word they were innocent they were pure amen they they had the purest of intentions the purest of Notions the purest of thoughts because why because they were behind God's word and so they were veiled even though they were naked they were veiled now let's go to Genesis chter 3 Verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons initially they were naked but they were veiled but when they left the word the veil their covering was removed and they recognized that they were naked nothing had nothing had changed in the amount of clothing that they were wearing but what it had changed is when they left the word they lost their covering because the covering came by the word the word produced the covering when they stayed behind the word they had a holy veil of the Holy Spirit covering them but when they moved from innocency to guilt by leaving the word by disbelieving the word and acting contrary to the word now they lost innocency they stepped outside of the word they lost the veil and their eyes were open and the veil was removed and they recognized I'm not covered and the first thing they did was start to make their own covering because now when the veil is lifted they realized I'm not covered I need to be covered now they're shame because they lost the veil of innocency so now they stitch together fig leaves which brother Brenham said is religion and they made their own religion their own covering and started trying to hide their shame their sin behind a covering that they made themselves and Isaiah I'll just read it to you you don't have to turn Isaiah 646 says but we are all as un unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fate as a leaf and all our iniquities like the wind take us away the the scripture says there is none that doeth good no not one the all of our righteousness and all of our deeds and all of our religion is still as filthy rags and filthy rags is not the covering you need to cover our sin and our nakedness our nakedness must be covered now because we left the veil of innocency so now there requires a covering but that covering can't be anything that you and I do because if that's our righteousness our righteousness is still filthy [Applause] rags so then we go to Genesis we're still in chapter 3 but let's go to verse 9 and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee and thou should us not eat now we've been through this before so you all know know you all understand this but but they were naked but covered they left the word and lost their covering and realized they were naked and made themselves a covering but when the voice of God came in the garden when the when the presence of God was made known by the voice of God he said I heard thy voice and I hid myself because I was naked amen technically he wasn't naked technically he was covered because he had his fig Leaf apron covering his sin and shame but in the presence of God God he realized this is no covering at all for this sin I'm completely naked in the presence of God so that he was naked but veiled unveiled recognized they were naked put on a veil and the presence of God recognized that they're naked amen this is a an impossible situation but God is going to provide the solution to the problem over we're in verse 21 when he begins to uh bring judgment and Reconciliation it goes to chapter 3: 21 unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them all of a sudden the man had a god-given covering in the beginning and that god-given covering was a holy Veil that was given to him by the word the word produced The Veil and when they stayed behind the word they were within the veil and they had a god provided covering to cover their nakedness when they left the word amen now they recognized their their position their nakedness they had no covering they tried to make their own covering but in the presence of God they recognized they were still naked they had nothing to cover their shame with but God in his Mercy was going to provide another god-given covering they failed the first god-given covering but God as a Holy Father and a loving father in his mercy and Grace he would provide another covering where they failed the original covering remember if they never failed the original covering in they would never need another covering he already gave them a covering a holy veil by the word amen and they left the word and left the veil now they could not produce anything in themselves that would cover their nakedness and shame but God as a loving father he would make the he would make the restitution he would make the offering so that he could bring them back under another Veil and that veil was the shed blood of a lamb now God would take and slay a lamb and he would take the skin of that lamb and he would take that skin and he would clothe and cover the shame the sin the nakedness of his children and what was he covering them in he was covering them in the skin of an innocent substitute and now under the innocent substitute now they were covered in this in this skin of the lamb and now they could they could continue in life and they could have a bit of uh restoration they could move on because God amen though they Des serve death God took a lamb as a substitute for them and that lamb became their sin so that they could get the Lamb's innocency and the innocency of the Lamb could be their covering God foreshadowed the entire Bible in this chapter amen the entire scripture his whole Plan of Redemption he laid out in one chapter in the Bible if you can read the story of ad Adam and Eve in the Bible you know the whole gospel because man now amen had fallen from the word of God remember the only sin is disbelief in the word and they disbelieved the word and now their veil was gone they were naked they were in corruption they were perverted they were spotted they were Scarlet they were Crimson amen and they need a covering amen their own covering could never cover amen it it could never cover their sin and shame but God was going to take something that was still innocent and the innocent was going to cover for the guilty because they lost their innocency what they needed was a veil of innocency to cover their nakedness and that lamb gave its innocency that lamb took their place and became the Sinner and died the sinner's death so that he could give and yield his innocency back to them and the Lamb's innocency would become their covering yeah and remember how brother brandham said he saw in a vision he said I I see Adam put his arms around Eve and as they walk out of the garden amen and they can see the bloody flaps of the skin as it slaps them in the thigh or in the leg as they walk out of the out of the Garden of Eden brother bam caught it in a vision and he saw amen that they walked out amen one arm around the other but they were completely clothed and a coat amen is a fulllength long garment it's a full covering what a coat is amen so they were covered completely covered by what by the lamb and when I when I look at this I find it astounding that God allowed brother benam to have a vision of this so that we would have a clearer picture of what they were covered in they were covered in fresh a fresh covering of a fresh kill amen and that fresh kill wasn't a tanned hide it wasn't tanned because the trickle of blood from the inside of the skin was still trickling down their leg as it slapped against their leg so if it wasn't a tan skin if it was a fresh skin taken off a fresh kill of an innocent substitute that means they were wearing amen the skin that still had the blood still had the blood on the inside that was running down they were under a blood covering a substitute had paid its price but the covering still had the blood amen and and I believe and I don't know this for sure but just by what brother bam said if it was fresh and untanned it must have still had the wool on the outside and so now what they were walking in was white wool amen your sins of their Scarlet shall be white as wool now the whiteness of the skin of the Lamb becomes their whiteness now they're walking in innocency be why because their sins are covered for praise be to God Amen praise be to God this is what God has done for us and this is what God is doing for us amen from the very beginning he took his children who had fallen from righteousness Who Fallen from the word and he began to restore them by slaying a lamb a substitute taking the skin of that Lamb with the fresh kill of a lamb the fresh substitute with the fresh blood putting it on his children and from the beginning he covered them in Blood and robed them in white why do you think when we get to the Book of Revelations their robes are white they're robed in white they're robed in white it all started in Genesis that's been God's plan from the beginning brother R says in the message look he says God being full full of grace and mercy took a substitute and it was a lamb or an animal was offered a substitutionary death but the blood of bulls and goats as Hebrews here said just previously to where I read cannot take away sin it only covered sin it was a propitiation truly but it just covered sin for it was speaking with good conscience looking forward to when the blood would come that would cleanse sin divorce it put it away forever that was the blood of the ultimate lamb Jesus Christ amen in the message God's power to transform brother B says now if you'll turn if you wish to write it down to Revelation the thirr chapter the Holy Spirit predicting this last age to the lean Pentecostal Church age in the last days he said Thou Art naked and blind and know it not amen there is God's seed under innocence not knowing at all they were naked under a veil of the Holy Spirit veiled them from sin and now in the last Church age we find hear that they are naked again and don't know it yeah but it's not the Holy Spirit Veil it's the veil that Satan slipped over Eve back there a veil of lust the lust Veil let's turn to this in in Revelation chapter 3 and look at this together Revelation 3 and verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leans write these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not Thou Art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isab that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous therefore and repent it's a Marvel that at the end time we find the church to supposedly the Church of God Amen standing in a condition where they're miserable wretched poor blind and naked and in this naked condition Hey listen when we get to this last Church age they're naked but they're all walking around with some form of clothing on this is a spiritual nakedness just like amen the nakedness in in Adam and Eve in the beginning was covered by a holy spiritual Veil amen this now has a natural Garment of some sort but they're spiritual completely naked just when just the same as when Adam was there with his fig leafes on and so now he says uh uh I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment not just rment but white rment speaking back to Purity cleansing whiteness white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear so now God is saying I have in this end time a coverage for your nakedness I have a white garment and I counsel you to come to me amen that I might give you this white rment that the shame of your nakedness do not appear that means in the in the end time in this lateran age you have a people so deceived that they're walking around completely naked at least Adam in the presence of God recognized that his fig leaes was nakedness amen at least when God's voice came walking in the garden something struck him and he knew that he was naked although he could look down and see the same covering that he tried to use to convince himself a few minutes earlier and when the presence of God came when the voice of God came Walking In The Garden in the cool of the evening he knew that those fig leaves were no covering at all that he was completely naked and now we've done the same thing through thousands of years of religion we've come to the end time and we've heard the voice of God in the cool of the evening come walking amongst us and it's a shame that there's people who don't even know they're naked but oh God May It Strike our hearts like never before that anything I do is nakedness anything I try is nakedness all my righteousness is filthy rags what do I need in this end time I need a white reignment that he provides me in this end time I need a covering so that the shame of my nakedness doesn't appear amen we're speaking spiritually now the whole thing is a spiritual applic application brother B said back in Satan's Eden again he says notice he said take our women now if you want to see what condition the church is in watch the way women are acting she always represents the church and Satan's Eden of sin and unbelief a religious perversion perverted Kingdom instead of taking God's word they have took the intellectual learning of man and instead of taking the church they took the organization and they're bringing it to one great head now notice perverted from innocence don't miss this now the church has been with the lust Veil on notice what it's done to her it's perverted her from innocence to knowledge the holy Veil she she was innocent with the lust Veil she is knowledge she knows it's Pleasant she knows what it does see it's a fruit a tree to be desired making one wise see she is perverted from innocence to knowledge from holiness to filth and lust and from life to death so what happened at the beginning she went from life to death she went from innocency to knowledge she lusted after knowledge she wanted to use intellect amen and she left innocency and innocency was found in simply staying behind the word amen without questioning without reasoning without scientific experimentation amen her innocency was preserved just by staying behind the word when she stayed behind the word she stayed in innocency she had a veil a covering for her nakedness amen but the minute she left by knowledge she left she left innocency for knowledge oh God help us help us never leave the Simplicity of innocency for knowledge let's go to Isaiah 61 together Isaiah 61 and let's look at verse 10 Isaiah 61 and10 I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation Heath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decked himself with ornaments and as a bride adorne herself with her Jewels so now Isaiah is rejoicing here in the prophecy he clothed me with the garments of Salvation Heath covered me with the robe of righteousness and he types it with the covering of a bridegroom and a bride my what a what a spot of uh foreshadow of Prophecy and so when we look at this scripture he's telling us he's telling us who has clothed who who's done the clothing and who's provided the clothes remember when Adam fell amen and he realized he was naked he provided his own covering but that covering was nakedness in the presence of God Amen but now there's nothing we we get to the place where there's nothing that Adam can do to fix his situation he can't reverse what's been done he can never change it he can never take it back he can never make it right there's not one blessed thing in the world that Adam can do to reverse this course of action he is stuck he tried with his own ability and his own knowledge and his own intellect and his own efforts he tried to make a covering that covering was totally unraveled and unveiled in the presence of a living God so now he stands there before a living God Amen absolutely unveiled to anything he tried to do and there's not a blessed thing in the world that he can do to cover his shame and nakedness so he's totally dependent on his father he's standing there in shame he's standing there in nakedness he's standing there in an irreversible condition yeah without a hope in the world right and his father takes a lamb listen if we we've learned these things since we're little toddlers we've learned these things since we're little kids those who' been raised in church and we know the story we've seen the picture books we've colored pictures about it amen but I don't think we realize the gravity of the situation he's standing there with no hope in the world nothing that he himself can ever do to ever cover his shame and nakedness he's lost he's finished he's done and there's nothing he can do himself right and here comes God Amen coming down in judgment and God is now ad ministering judgment and he's standing here naked exposed helpless with irreversible damage and there's nothing he can do but he's got a loving father who created him and has a purpose for his life and that father goes and finds an innocent lamb that's never sinned never disbelieved never done anything wrong and he took that lamb and he slayed that lamb can you imagine what Adam was thinking when he was watching God there had never been death there had never been Bloodshed there never been the bleeding of the Lamb there never been the stench of fresh flowing blood this was death yes this was I I guarantee a traumatic event first time he had ever witnessed it first time he had ever seen death first time he had ever witnessed suffering the first time he' ever seen blood flow the first time he had heard a desperate bleed the first time he had heard a death rattle yes and it was God doing it it was God afflicting the punishment it was God causing the death what was he doing it for because he had to have a covering of innocency to cover the shame of his son sir something had to die because that was the penalty for sin so God took this innocent lamb and this innocent lamb became Adam by imputation and he imputed Adam's sin upon this lamb and slayed slayed the lamb not for the lamb but he slayed the lamb for Adam's sins amen and then he took the skin off of the lamb and he placed it upon his son and now his son was covered and could continue on amen he wasn't smitten dead in an instant he continued on and God was trying he was beginning the process of restoring fellowship with his Fallen son what a what an experience that would have been to live through it's not a coloring book page it was a reality but neither is Jesus Christ nailed to the cross a coloring book page it's a reality amen who was nailed to the cross that's me he wasn't there for him he was there for me he was nailed because of my sin because of my nakedness because I left the word because I left the veil of innocency not just I was born wrong I chose to do wrong amen and he took all of my sin and all of my shame and all of my perversion and all of my red spots and he shed his blood and he died and he was the innocent lamb so that God could clothe me in a white robe amen praise God let's go over to Revelation chapter 3 I'm going to read a couple scriptures here as we move forward with this thought Revelation CH 3 verse four Revelation 3 and4 thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which ha not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white reignment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father before his angels when we get to the Sardis age he begins to say there's a few names even as Sardis which have not defiled their garments you know he is not talking about the clothes they were wearing Maybe he was talking about their garments weren't defiled what are the garments that a Christian wears what is the spiritual garment that we wear well the prophet of God told us that we are clothed in the word of God we actually are putting on Christ which is the word and there was those in sard us who weren't defiling the word that they had received you have a few and Sardis who have not defiled their garments that means theyve stayed true to the message of their day they haven't defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white listen he didn't he didn't describe what those garments looked like he didn't describe uh uh how they were made all he said is they didn't defile their garments whatever they had been given they were wearing and they weren't defiling it whatever that messenger had brought for that day they were clothed in it and they weren't defiling but he says if those who've kept their garments shall Walk With Me In White for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life he's promising if they not defile the Garment they have they're going to have a white rment amen there's a promise that's coming let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 together book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter 5 in verse 25 says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish so God is going to cleanse his bride God is going to have a bride that is going to be restored that's going to be cleaned from the spots that's going to be cleaned from the blemishes that's going to be pure amen and restored to him and he says he's going to sanctify and cleanse it with the washing how's he going to cleanse it by the washing of the water of the word the word amen is going to remove the spots the word is going to bring Purity the word is going to remove blemish or spot or wrinkle he says that he might presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish so God is going to have a bride amen that is going to be holy and without blemish do you believe that so how is he going to get a bride that's holy and without blemish well it'll probably be when the bride finally figures out what she's doing wrong and gets her act together and starts doing all the right things right because she's got to be a pure bride without spot or wrinkle she's got to start getting her act together she's got to start listening she's going to have to Buck Up and that's not what the scripture says anywhere but it says that he might sanctify and cleanse it he cleanse it he cleanse it she doesn't clean herself he's going to sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of the Water by the word that means if he's going to wash her by the word he's got to provide the word that'll do the washing because she has nothing she can do herself the bride stands listen the bride stands when you come into this world you may be predestinated to be bride of Jesus Christ but before you come to the washing of this word and the clothing of this word you're standing in the same spot Adam was standing in there's irreversible damage there's not a thing in the world that you can do you need a heavenly father to come down and provide a veil of Innocence to cover your shame and nakedness he didn't ask you to do it yourself if you do it yourself you'll do what Adam did and you'll create another denomination to add to the 40,000 denominations and it won't work any better than 40,000 so we stand Here Helpless hopeless in Leo deia miserable wretched blind naked and don't know it until we hear the voice of God come walking in the cool of the evening and then we realize we're naked when we realize we're naked we need a garment but he says come to me for I have a white garment that'll cover your nakedness the shame of your nakedness amen so now it says he will sanctify and cleanse with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious Church read these scriptures and tell me what the church is supposed to to do to save herself to cleanse herself to sanctify herself and to make herself white we'll get to that in a minute he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish now we don't we're not ignorant of the fact that brother Benham said God put himself in partnership with man that there's something for you to do too but that thing for you to do is not make your own garment not wash yourself not provide a word that's pure and clean for the washing not to make yourself wrinkle free and spot and blemish free that's not your job that's his job we are own partnership God and there is something for us to do but that part's not ours to do that's his to do and he's promised to do it Amen brother B says in the invisible union he says the first wedding was n it was you never done it he's talking about the first you come married to an Adam nature because you were born wrong but he says that first wedding is analed as if it never happened it was discredited yeah off the books your first wedding was an knowed it was you never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the Water by the word the word not the denominational not denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you going to be washed you're still as spotted as Eve was so in this partnership amen with the prophet brought it this way what am I supposed to do I'm just supposed to stay in the flow of the water amen I don't provide the water I don't do the cleansing I don't make myself white but my job is just to stay under the flowing of the water why because he's never removed free choice from me yeah we're in partnership with God we have something to do that's something to do is just say wash me Lord I'm not going anywhere wash me pour the bucket over me again and again and again if I need another dousing douse me again if I need another scrubbing scrub me again I can't cleanse myself let's go to Revelation 19 Revelation 19 and I want to read from verse 6 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be aray in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints it's amazing she's she's he says let us rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready see that we're back on partnership again there's something for her to do and it said and to her was granted that she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints I hope you're seeing this actually isn't a picture of the Garment the bride's going to be wearing literally this is a spiritual condition he's going to bring her into he's going to have a linen garment that's going to be pure and white and Winkle free with no stains and her was granted that she should be be a ra in fine linen clean and white with for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and so now when he says it's the righteousness of the Saints you you can start to think well this is our righteousness but you got to remember we have no righteousness our righteousness is as filthy rags so what is the righteousness of the Saints the righteousness of the Saints is his righteousness imputed unto us because we believe his word not because we did something not because we worked the work not because we were able to accomplish some Deeds but his righteousness is is what's imputed unto us when we believe Abraham had righteousness imputed unto him why did righteousness was imputed unto Abraham because he believed amen now we have righteousness imputed unto us why do we have righteousness imputed unto us because we believe amen so whose righteousness is the righteousness of the Saints it's not your righteousness it's his righteousness imputed unto you because you believe Amen in The Invisible union he says he says you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place brother bren's now in 1965 he's in November 25th in 1965 he's right around Thanksgiving time amen and he's coming and preaching a Thanksgiving message and this is just a short time before he's taken off the scene this is the end of his ministry and at the end of the ministry he's come to realize amen that this water that's provided in Ephesians 5 is here this garment for the bride to wear is here and he's coming here and he's showing you how much of a garment's been presented and how much of a pure water is here look at what he says he says you never sinned at the first place right God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God Hey listen when he says that he means it and I believe it amen it's not that I should be Conjuring up that old book of divorcement I was like this and I was like that and I was like that it's out of the mind of God forever totally out of existence I never did it in the first place this is what the message is intended to bring us to he said washed in the blood I'm sorry divorce must put away it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was what is he have to do to take a bride he can't take a polluted bride he's got to wash her he's got to clothe her he's got to bring her back to innocency he can't marry listen Christ can't be United with sin Christ can't be United amen with corruption and perversion so what does he have to do he has to change though your sins be like Scarlet they'll be made white as snow he's got to do it because he can't Unite with the sin so he's got to do something about the sin listen to what brother M says again in The Invisible union says what is sin sin is unbelief we know this we've talked about this so many times we we know it but we don't know it I'm convinced we know it but we don't fully realize it because we keep thinking of all the bad things we've ever done and they keep coming in our mind and the one flaw that we have in humanity amen that God has perfected is God is able to forget but we're not how I wish I had that mind that could forget God is able to forget and put it out of existence amen I'm not so in my Humanity I keep going back to worse days and worse things and that worst day and worse things might have been yesterday and we keep knocking oursel out of position because of those things God's not taking us out of position we take ourselves out of our positionen because of our own mind so what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in God which is the word word pure unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on his word so he starts off by what sin you're being purified from sin what is sin unbelief what is causing the purification it's the bleeding word what's the bleeding word doing to purify me from sin because the bleeding word is a restoration of the word so they we're not caught up in the fallacies and the false doctrines and false understanding that came by knowledge what's he doing he's bringing back a pure word so that you can come by a pure seed inside can reach up and say that ain't nothing but the truth brother brandham and it's declaring that the righteousness of Christ is imputed unto you because you believe not because you did because you believe not because you do but because you believe that's the gospel that's what makes children of Abraham that was Abraham's righteousness he's the father of the faithful he's the father of Faith amen it's the faith in the present tense word of God Amen that's the leading word the word that's shedding its blood right now for us it's the fresh kill of the word brother Brenham said that has the fresh skin and that fresh covering where you can be clothed in the fresh kill of the word and you will walk and there going to be a trickle of blood from the inside of this word that's fresh and running down your legs because in Leo deia he says you're naked you don't know it but come and by of me I've got a white raymen in this time amen that the shame of your nakedness will no longer show no longer in deception no longer in unbelief no longer Amen in fallacy from denomination but the word has been restored you say but but brother Chad I don't understand all of it he never required understanding he never required intellectualism Eve was never required to understand why God said don't touch it wasn't required to understand the science behind it to know the implications of it she was only to believe it and stay behind it yes and when by knowledge she was deceived and disbelieved and acted on that she moved out and lost her veil of innocency and became perverted and needed a substitute but now God has brought back a covering amen his word see it was in John 1:1 we quote it all the time in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God we go to John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh so it means what was God at one time God expressed through his word and that expression took on a form as a human being Jesus Christ God made flesh and that word that's where brother B said that word became flesh in Jesus Christ and that word went to Calvary and that word was beaten and that word was pierced and that word bled that's where brother brandham gets this whole concept the word bled for you the word died for you because Jesus Christ was the fullness of the word the fullness of the godhead bodily and that fullness of the word was bleeding for you at Calvary there's so many Concepts that brother B puts together to try to explain these things he starts talking about the fresh kill of the word amen that there's a there's a there's a fresh kill there's a fresh sacrifice amen every day and there's a word for this day which is the message of the hour amen and it's freshness amen it's got the blood still in it it's got the life still in it and it's the life and the blood and the and the word that's covering our shame and covering our nakedness too many people are trying to use something from a previous day what was in a previous day was good for the previous today amen but God has a covering for today amen amen and that covering is fresh it's not been tanned it still has the blood with it it still has the flesh amen the covering the skin because it was the veil that hid the word amen was that that that innocent lamb what was that innocent lamb that innocent lamb was becoming the word because it was foreshadowing the Lamb of God so what was God slaying on that day when Adam sent God was slaying the word what was he clothing them with with the word because this was in his mind before the foundation of the world and he was going to come and he was going to be the lamb himself and and the and the that word made flesh now that word was going to be the covering so they were covered in the word the bleeding word this isn't a new concept when brother Brenham grabs his terminology he's explaining the entire gospel it sounds weird cuz we never heard preachers preach like that before we never heard these terms but it's spoton with the entire Bible and so in this day brother Brandon preached indictment is that right what do he preach indictment for for the second crucifixtion of Jesus Christ but we didn't see a man like the man who walk walk by the Sea of Galilee we didn't see a man nailed to a cross what how did they crucify Jesus Christ at the same time because he came back in the fullness of the word which was the same thing that was nailed to the cross same exact thing nothing different that was the word made flesh this is the word made manifest yeah it's the same thing so when Jesus Christ came back in this day as the fullness of the word amen the person of the word what did the nomin the denominations do they did the same thing they 2,000 years ago they crucified the Lord aresh Brother Bram said in that day when they took the Lamb of God and slayed the Lamb of God now what they did is they killed the old order that God had mercy through the law of Moses and from that day it was the lamb and the lamb alone but in this day when they took the Lamb of God the word of God in this day and they rejected it and they slain it from that day forward it was no longer Mercy at God winking at the ignorance of the church ages but it became the word and the word only right the bleeding bloody word amen the blood of atonement for us in this day which was the word that's been restored and it becomes also our covering clothed in the bleeding bloody word maybe with the wool still attack Ed so you can be white as War brother BM said in present stage of my Ministry said I'm trusting him someday I don't know when for a crowning of my Ministry I've stayed just as true as I could be I don't know what it'll be I don't know when it'll be and just when he's ready I'm I am done up here I hope when he will Crown my Ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the cloth of the word for his righteousness what a brother want the crowning of his ministry to be to take the word of God and put a garment on the bride amen what kind of garment a wedding garment that's the kind of garment amen the kind of garment that's offered and to the leodan church age amen Is His Garment a white garment that'll cover the shame of your nakedness why because he can't receive that bride and until she's been restored to a condition of innocency he can't take her in perversion so he must provide for her a garment and he provided it in the message of the hour it is the wedding garment friends amen right there's so many like I said so many terms that that the prophet of God uses your feeding on the body word of the son of man the bleeding bloody word and and and and and they they they're bringing him from the old Pascal lamb to the true atonement the word he uses all of these things and it can be so confusing because we've never heard preachers preach like that but when you catch what he's saying he's saying the same thing over and over and over again amen the blood represents the life the life is back because the word's comeing back it's a fresh kill of the word for our day it's got life in it it's got blood in it it'll cover us cleanse us make us ready for the union with Christ and what is it it's the message because the message is Christ not books and tapes but Jesus Christ the word that's been restored back to the bride and what is she supposed to do to make herself ready she's got to straighten up and quit chewing gum in church and start dressing no all she's got to do is let the prophet put the clothing on her and stay in it it's that easy friends it's not complicated it's not hard what did Adam have to do Adam tried he failed what has the bride done for 2,000 years tried and failed tried and failed tried and fail F all kinds of different stitching that that fig Leaf garment didn't work maybe we'll sew it this way well that didn't work that denomination if we had a split in that denomination okay all right you're using the Fig leaves inside out let's flip them around now let's try stitching it that way that's what's been happening for 2,000 years as man keeps trying to modify the Garment but oh praise God in the end time he's got a white garment amen and he's provided it through the preaching of the word through a prophet and brother B when the crowning of his ministry be to clothe a bride and the Garment of the word what kind of word the bleeding bloody word the fresh kill of the word the word that still has life and blood and atonement in it that can cover your scarlet stains and the bride is just like Adam just like the woman oh the way back in Genesis hopeless and without a hope in the world yes right lost is lost can be destroyed perverted corrupted with irreversible damage but God came but God came how are we in this age the same spot amen covered in fig leafes of religion it wasn't working but God came amen and God provided a lamb and God provided a word and God provided the life and God gave the Garment amen amen you know what Adam had to do all he had to do was stand there and let God put the coat on him amen he didn't have to sew it Stitch It slay the lamb he didn't have to do anything he just had to let God put it on him and then his responsibility you know what his part is not to take it off God's in partnership with man God never takes away free moral agency what was Adam's part of the whole deal to stand and be clothed in the coat of innocency and then to walk in it and not take it off and not alter it not hem it up shorten the sleeves tuck it in here amen just leave it the way God gave it yeah right just let him put it on and wear it don't alter it don't change it don't trim it don't make it more fashionable don't Puff the sleeves don't shorten them to 3/4 don't don't do a high low front back amen leave it just the way he gave it amen through the prophet that's all Adam had to do all Adam to do to have his sins covered all he had had to do was walk in the Garment God gave him and stay in it and not take it off and not change it what is it you and I need to do the same exact thing just stay under the washing of the water of the word just let that Prophet put that word on us just allow him to put the Garment on and just stay in the Garment friends don't alter it don't change it don't take it off amen just walk in this word and what will be restored to us innocency not my innocency not my righteousness I'm wearing his righteousness and I'm clothed in his white garment and I'm covered in his innocency Adam was guilty condemned to die what he needed was innocency and he had to get innocent y from an innocent victim and God provided the innocent victim and that innocent victim became guilty instead of Adam so Adam could have his innocency yeah amen oh praise God Jesus Christ came and took my sin upon himself he became guilty he became the sinner he bore the sins of the world and the full brunt of God's judgment why so that he could give his innocency to me so that I could come to him in Purity and innocency and and CLE cleanliness not mine his yes amen God had to restore a word so that he could marry a bride in this age he couldn't come to the marriage Union when the Garment was partial when the spots were still showing through denominationalism when they had partial truth he had to come to where he could fully restore the entire garment which is Jesus Christ the full word of God has come back in this day and there's been a prophet here to clothe a bride in the end time what is that the crowning of his ministry amen yeah and what's God asking of us to do signs and miracles and wonders and be perfect in every way with no flaw he's asking us to keep the Garment on stay in it stay under the water let him keep washing let him keep clothing let him keep covering our spots with the word let him keep adorning the way he wants us to Adorn not the way we want adorned let him decide where the Garment goes and how much is covered let him just keep preparing us how has the Bride made herself ready she let the prophet dresser amen how did Esther get herself ready to meet King aeras she took only what Hagi required she let the king's Chamberlain dress her she didn't alterate change or add her opinion to it that's right what do we need to do how do we make ourselves ready just take what Hagi said just take the Garment that's been given to us this day just take the pure word that's been restored and let him put it on and just leave it on yes sir don't say this is stiff and it's uncomfortable just wear it a while it'll get more comfortable let it change you let it shape you let the life of the word begin to mold you to fit the Garment not try to get the Garment to fit us praise God this is what the prophet longed to be able to do and the seventh seal the prophet says we can see the elements ready to bring it back we can see the elements ready to bring the church into the presence of Christ we can see the bride taking on the form putting the wedding garment on making ready we can see the lights of flickering we know that we're at the end praise God and birth pains brother B says the Bible said his wife has made herself ready at the End of the Age how did she make herself ready I love I love when the prophet tells us see we hear things and we get ideas the bride make herself ready you can have all kinds of ideas what that means to make herself ready you got to ship up Shape Up get this done and Nip Tuck and we have all kinds of ideas when it means to make herself ready Pro says how did she make herself ready to become his wife and what does she what kind of garment she had on his own word she was dressed in his righteousness yes that's what it is right how did she make yourself ready what do we have to do to make ourselves ready just put the word on just wear it don't listen to it put it on don't just agree with it let it become your garment amen fit into the Garment of the word let God clothe us with his righteousness this whole idea of naked and clothed it it it goes all the way through the Bible but what are we going to be clothed with in the end time we're going to be clothed with Christ we're going to be clothed with the life the atonement the purification why why now because now is the time of the wedding we're going to the wedding supper but the wedding's taking place here and what is he doing in the wedding time he's got to restore store a bride to innocency so he can take a bride to himself the perfect bridegroom has to have a perfect bride but the bride can't be perfect on her own so he has to provide something to make her perfect so he sent a messenger he sent a Chamberlain he sent a Hagi he sent a brother brandom he sent a seventh angel he sent a man in this day amen that could that could bring out the water of washing of the word amen so that she could be washed and purified in the word and he brought out the Garment so that she be clothed in the right garment and what does she have to do the same thing Adam did just let it be put on and just wear it amen I want to be clothed in his righteousness what is his righteousness his word what declares me righteous what makes you righteous what makes me righteous what makes anybody righteous the same thing that made Abraham righteous amen Abraham was declared righteous and then tried to sell his wife out how's that make sense what makes what what is that righteousness it's his righteousness how what is my righteousness my righteousness is his righteousness how do I get his righteousness well he puts his righteousness on me why does he put his righteousness on me because I believe his word it's that simple you know believing is not straining believing is not a brain cramp I don't understand this I don't know how to that's not believing faith is a gift that God gives it's not of yourselves it's a gift of God it's something inside of you that can just say truth truth truth I don't get it but it's true I don't know that I measure up but it's true I don't know how to measure it but it's still true it's a gift of God and that gift of God's been given to us and when that gift goes into exercising and then all a sudden there's a confession and there's a faith that believes then God imputes unto us his very own righteousness and God brings us back to innocency not because I'm innocent but because he's put his innocency over top of me and I'm clothed in his innocency the same Adam was clothed in the innocency of that lamb and now we're clothed in the Purity the thoughtlessness the innocency of this pure word which is Christ himself that's why brother brandom at the end of his ministry said you're the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you never did it to begin with it's not even in God's mind it's put out of his remember it's all together you have no spot because red through red looks white I'm so thankful God sent us this message friend what were we going to do if God didn't come in the cool of the evening if he didn't provide the Garment what would Adam do what would we do nothing we could do friends you and I would be doing the same thing everybody else is doing we would be going Hog Wild for ourselves and for the world or we'd be stitching together another kind of fig Leaf but this message is love and grace and Purity and this is innocency restored to a bride who's been Fallen not mine but his one of the things I think we struggle with more than anything is a lack of confidence because we've been taught to be self-confident and to be confident means to be self-confident but I don't think self-confidence is going to do us a bit of good but nonetheless we should be the most confident people on the face of the Earth but not self-confident because it's not me it's not my faith not my righteous not my garment not my word yeah that's right amen but I am confident that that word is pure and I'm confident that that's Christ and I'm confident that it's right and I'm confident the word is pure and I'm confident that I believe it amen so I'm confident that he's washing me in the word that he's clothing me in the word and that I stand before him the same way brother Brenham said the bride stands not because I done anything right or anything to justify but simply because I had something in me that could say that's nothing but the truth we should be able to stand in confidence when we Face obstacles confidence when we have disaster confidence when we fail ourselves and say I'm not much but this word is everything I may fail but this never will I may make a mistake but his promise is never going to be a mistake and how do I know it's mine not because I can prove it not because I have a certificate they even asked brother brandham I I don't have the quote so I'm just going by memory I might have a little wrong they said brother BR can you prove or do you know for sure that that that you're you're one of them or you're born again or something like that and he says no there's no way to prove it he said but I believe it by faith faith is the substance of things hoped for faith is the reality faith is what's true we sometimes try to make good works and a testimony of our faith listen good works will come don't worry about it but you're not always going to do good works but our confidence needs to be in this wedding garment that he's put on us and I'm wearing it you know what I'm still a little clumsy in it it's still tight in some spots and loose in the other I know I've got to grow into this garment but I've Got Confidence in the Garment not in me I know that it's covering me me I know that it's purifying me I know that he's looking at the Garment of the word and he's declaring me sinless spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ no matter how messed up I am on the inside red through red looks white to him God knows he's going to change that corruption into incorruption someday and this old body of mine's going to drop and I'm going to take another robe yeah in Corinthians Paul talks about that your soul amen you grown to be clothed yes clothed upon so that you won't be found naked what's Paul talking about your soul amen longs to be clothed but not with corruption your soul longs to be clothed with incorruption which is your inheritance in the heavens which is pure and ly white which is your theophany which never sin in the first place and when you leave this earth less what you get a white robe and that white robe is your theophany they're waiting for you and if you have a white robe there that means you're predestinated Amen to go and wear that Lily white robe of your theophany and if he's predestinated if you've got a theophany there then he's got a garment for you to wear here that'll purify you and take you there I'm so thankful that we have a white garment that'll cover the shame of our nakedness thank god let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come I just want to read to you one scripture as we're standing as the musicians come it's out of Revelation 19 It's the Return of Christ on a white horse in Revelation 1911 he says I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he that judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean brother bam tells us that the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols is that right I don't know what kind of garments we'll wear in the Millennium we may all wear white robes every single day of our lives or we might have different kinds of garments depending on the task that we're assigned to I don't know but I know that this is symbolic because Revelation is a book of symbols and when we come back with Christ and return we won't be spotted anymore because we will be clothed in fine linen white and clean you know this is not me this is only a garment that I'm wearing yeah and this garment is spotted because of perversion because of the fall in the garden so God has a spiritual Veil to Veil over this spotted garment and that Veil is himself that's him we put on Christ but there's going to come a day when I'm going to get another Veil for my soul Amen to come back in a glorified body with my theophany with my soul and a glorified body and I will be clothed the real me that's down on the inside that's now clothed in perversion is going to one day be clothed in Perfection when God brings me back to a glorified body and I will return to this earth in the Millennium clothed and white linen white and clean no more perversion no more corruption no more hybridization we're going to be clothed yeah forever and linens white and clean amen God bless you all let's bow our heads and thank God for his word Lord Jesus I thank you for your word God we can't fathom we can't fathom the privilege that we have I don't know there's any way to express it Lord the way it's in my heart how we are most the most privileged people that have ever been on the face of the Earth God you unveil yourself and unveil yourself and unveil yourself again and you show us Lord things that we've known but oh how you bring them into full color time and time again how encouraging it is to know Lord that you've done for us in this age the same thing you did for Adam when he fell so thankful Lord to know that you've sent us a garment a wedding garment that's not partial it's not missing pieces but it's perfect it's pure

would help us Lord to have eyes that see and ears to hear God we're coming to you in this day for the white reignment that covers the shame of our nakedness Lord Jesus I'm ashamed of myself I'm ashamed of all my fig Leaf efforts Lord I have tried through human effort and knowledge pure willpower to do something in myself to cover myself and I have failed you Lord but as your your voice continues to ring loud and clear in this generation every effort of mine has equal nakedness complete and utter shame and humiliation but Lord you've come in this generation the same as you did to Adam and you've restored to us a garment Lord a garment that the church was supposed to have and wear and put on and grow but she began to change it she began to adapt it and add to it and take away from it God in the end time you've brought the Garment back you brought the life back the fresh blood You' brought it back the pure water you've restored it you've given us the wedding garment you sent a prophet Lord to tell us how to wear it God help us to just slip into it and stay in it grow us Lord to fit nicely into this Garment of this word shape us Lord and mold us and mold our character and our thoughts and our actions mold us Lord to fit your garment perfectly May the Garment work the changes in US Lord to bring us into shape into form that you predestinated for us to be that your Masterpiece might be complete in US wash us Lord in your word wash away our thinking our ideas our foolish effort efforts wash it all away and give us the humility just to stand still and say I can't do a thing to save myself may we receive what you've given to us in this day and let it be enough help us to let this message be enough your word your life your spirit that comes with it may it be
