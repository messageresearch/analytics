[6:01] his child and forever I am.
[6:06] Amen. Since I saw my name in the book of
[6:12] redemption,
[6:14] since I saw my name in the book.
[6:18] [Music]
[6:19] Oh, I'm in communion with Christ my
[6:24] redeemer.
[6:25] Since I saw my name in the book.
[6:29] Yes. Since I saw my name in the book of
[6:35] redemption.
[6:36] Since I saw my name in the book.
[6:41] Oh, I'm in communion with Christ, my
[6:46] redeemer.
[6:47] Since I saw my name in the book. Oh, one
[6:51] more time. Well, since I saw my name. My
[6:56] name in that book. Since I saw my name
[7:00] in the book.
[7:03] Oh, I am so happy with Christ my
[7:07] redeemer
[7:09] since I saw my name in the glor.
[7:14] Amazing grace
[7:16] will always be my song
[7:23] of praise.
[7:25] For it was grace
[7:30] that bought my liberty.
[7:38] I do not know
[7:42] just why he came to love me so.
[7:50] evil beyond
[7:54] my fall and saw my need.
[8:02] And I shall for it
[8:07] burn
[8:09] my eyes to kill the tree
[8:15] to hear the cross
[8:19] where Jesus died for me.
[8:25] [Music]
[8:26] How marvelous
[8:28] [Applause]
[8:30] the grace that caught my falling soul.
[8:38] He looked beyond
[8:42] my fallen soul. My Oh, let's just stand
[8:47] together as we sing that first verse
[8:49] again. Amazing
[8:51] grace. So thankful for your grace, Lord.
[8:56] Oh, it'll be my song of praise.
[9:00] Oh,
[9:01] for it was grace
[9:06] that bought my liberty.
[9:14] I do not know
[9:17] just how he came to love me so.
[9:25] But he looks beyond
[9:29] my fall and soul my need.
[9:35] [Music]
[9:36] And I shall forever
[9:42] my eyes to calary
[9:48] to you the cross
[9:53] where Jesus died for me.
[10:00] How marvelous
[10:04] the grace that caught my falling soul.
[10:12] He looked beyond
[10:16] my fault and saw my need.
[10:22] Oh, he looked beyond
[10:26] my fall and he saw my need
[10:33] and I bless your name.
[10:37] [Music]
[10:39] Oh, I bless your name.
[10:45] I give you honor.
[10:52] Give you praise.
[10:57] You are the life,
[11:00] the life, the truth, the way.
[11:08] I bless your name.
[11:13] I bless
[11:16] Oh, I bless your name this morning,
[11:18] Lord. I bless your name.
[11:25] I bless your name.
[11:30] I give you honor.
[11:37] Give you praise.
[11:42] You are the life.
[11:45] [Music]
[11:47] You're the truth, the way.
[11:52] I bless your name.
[11:57] Oh, I bless your name. As brother Chad
[12:02] comes this morning some midnight hour.
[12:07] [Music]
[12:09] Oh, if you could find
[12:14] your in
[12:21] your life,
[12:25] then reach out and praise.
[12:28] I will praise the final
[12:33] chain.
[12:34] [Music]
[12:35] Oh, and they will fall.
[12:39] Thank you, Lord, in Jesus
[12:44] name. Oh, we're going to bless your
[12:46] name. We bless your name.
[12:52] We bless your name.
[12:57] We give you honor.
[13:04] give you praise.
[13:09] You are the life,
[13:14] the truth, the way.
[13:21] We bless your name.
[13:26] We bless your name.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Let's bow our
[13:35] heads together and pray. Dear heavenly
[13:38] father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we
[13:41] can bless your name, Lord. You've been
[13:42] so good to us. And God, it's with love
[13:46] in our hearts and great joy, Lord, that
[13:48] we can lift our hands and say, "We bless
[13:50] your name. We love you, Lord, for you
[13:53] are wonderful and your mercies are new
[13:55] every morning. And you've been so good
[13:56] to us, Lord." And God, here we gather
[14:00] this morning, Lord, to sing your
[14:01] praises. You've drawn us, Lord, to
[14:04] yourself. For no man can come to you
[14:07] unless you draw, Lord. God, I pray now
[14:10] that you would feed us as we come, your
[14:12] waiting sheep, hungry, Lord, for more of
[14:14] you. Lord, would you come and break the
[14:16] bread of life with your own hands? Lord,
[14:19] I yield this vessel of mine unto you
[14:21] that you might use it for this purpose,
[14:23] Lord. For God, you determined, Lord,
[14:25] that you would preach the gospel and
[14:27] that you would use man. And God, I want
[14:29] to be a vessel that you can take full
[14:31] control of and have preeminence and use
[14:34] for that purpose. And may the words,
[14:35] Lord, of eternal life come forth. May
[14:38] they strike our hearts, Lord. And may
[14:40] they root down deep and bring forth a
[14:42] bountiful harvest unto your glory. For
[14:45] we give ourselves to that purpose. May
[14:47] you come and have preeminence among us
[14:49] as we yield and surrender to you. In
[14:52] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[14:56] Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you all.
[14:59] It's certainly good to be here together
[15:01] again this morning. Amen. If you want to
[15:03] take your Bibles with me
[15:06] and we can turn to the book of uh
[15:08] Romans. We can turn to Romans chapter 3
[15:12] together. Just want to remind you that
[15:14] uh brother Gabe Smith is away preaching.
[15:16] He's across town preaching for Bible
[15:18] believers. So, we want to remember him
[15:20] and his family today. And also, we got a
[15:22] few visitors here with us today. So, uh
[15:25] we just want to say hi to the Ritter
[15:27] family. It's good to have you guys back
[15:28] with us again in fellowship. God bless
[15:30] you. And I saw Daniel Ber and his family
[15:32] here. God bless you. They're from
[15:34] Junction City. So, it's good to have you
[15:36] all here once again. And uh also, we've
[15:39] got visitors that are from the Chicago
[15:41] area. Brother Peter and Sister Sharon
[15:43] Art. They're passing through this uh
[15:45] area on vacation and they stopped in.
[15:47] So, wherever you are, God bless you.
[15:49] It's good to have you. Want you to feel
[15:51] very welcome here today. Also want to
[15:54] remind you that we have a fellowship
[15:55] dinner after service immediately after
[15:57] service down in the uh fellowship hall.
[16:00] So all of you who are visitors, we hope
[16:02] that you can stay and join us and we'd
[16:03] love to share the time of fellowship uh
[16:06] with you all. Amen. Let's look at Romans
[16:10] chapter 3.
[16:20] Romans chapter 3
[16:23] verse
[16:25] uh
[16:28] verse 21. Let's start at verse 21.
[16:33] says, "But now the righteousness of God
[16:35] without the law is manifested, being
[16:37] witnessed by the law and the prophets,
[16:40] even the righteousness of God, which is
[16:42] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
[16:45] upon all them that believe. For there's
[16:47] no difference. For all have sinned and
[16:49] come short of the glory of God, being
[16:52] justified freely by his grace through
[16:54] the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
[16:57] whom God has set forth to be a
[16:59] propitiation through faith in his blood,
[17:01] to declare his righteousness for the
[17:03] remission of sins that are passed
[17:05] through the forbearance of God, to
[17:07] declare, I say, at this time his
[17:09] righteousness, that he might be just and
[17:12] the justifier of him which believeth in
[17:15] Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is
[17:19] excluded. Amen. Praise God. By what law?
[17:23] Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we conclude that a man is
[17:29] justified by faith without the deeds of
[17:32] the law. Amen. God bless you as you take
[17:35] your seats. Amen.
[17:39] Amen. So, we're going to continue on.
[17:40] Brother Frank, if you want to bring the
[17:41] first slide up. Uh we're just going to
[17:43] continue our thought and carry over from
[17:46] Sunday. Sunday we talked about the
[17:48] strength of grace and talked about what
[17:50] God has done for us uh unmmerited of
[17:54] ourselves without our input. God did it
[17:56] for us. Amen. Before we were born.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; He sent Christ Jesus to die as a
[18:01] propitiation for our sins before uh
[18:05] before we were born. If you want to turn
[18:08] with me, let's go ahead and turn to
[18:10] Ephesians chapter 2.
[18:14] Yeah. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8. Verse
[18:16] 8. For by grace are you saved through
[18:19] faith and that not of yourselves. It is
[18:22] the gift of God. Not of works lest any
[18:25] man should boast. Amen. This is a
[18:28] continuation of the the thought that we
[18:30] had over in Romans because in Romans it
[18:33] was it was telling us that we are saved.
[18:35] We are justified by faith. Amen. By
[18:38] grace in God. Now, we we're considered
[18:40] righteous and justified by faith. But we
[18:42] can't take credit for that faith. We
[18:45] can't be proud. We can't be puffed up.
[18:47] We can't be overly zealous because I
[18:49] believe the word. We believe the word
[18:51] because it was given to us by grace.
[18:53] Amen. By grace are you saved through
[18:54] faith and that not of yourselves. It is
[18:56] a gift of God. Amen. Where is boasting
[18:58] then? It's excluded because we can't say
[19:01] I'm I'm great because I believe. No,
[19:04] you're not. You're not great because you
[19:06] believe. You believe by the grace of
[19:07] God. You believe by his greatness, not
[19:10] our greatness.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; He says in Romans 9 verse1 15 says, "For
[19:16] he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on
[19:19] whom I will have mercy, and I will have
[19:21] compassion on whom I will have
[19:22] compassion." So then it is not of him
[19:24] that willth, nor of him that runth, but
[19:27] of God that showeth mercy. So this is
[19:29] important for us to understand it. It's
[19:32] not that the it's not in my efforts.
[19:35] It's not in what I could do. was not in
[19:37] and how I achieved anything because
[19:40] there was there was no achievement.
[19:42] Amen. That brought me to this place of
[19:44] salvation. And it's so important. That's
[19:46] why there's no boasting. What should we
[19:48] boast in? Because it wasn't my
[19:49] achievement that earned anything with
[19:51] God. It wasn't it wasn't uh uh what I
[19:54] had learned or what I God bless you,
[19:55] Sister Anne. Sister Anne Gibbs is here
[19:57] with Brother Wesley. Amen. Sorry, I got
[20:00] distracted.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so it's not in what we can
[20:05] take credit in. Amen. So, all glory goes
[20:08] back to God who saved us by his grace.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what brother Bham says in
[20:14] the message of grace.
[20:16] Says he can save a wretch like me. And
[20:20] he did. What is it? Grace. William
[20:23] Brand. I'm a drunkard son. That don't
[20:25] make any difference. The grace of God
[20:27] saved me.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Me, I'm a woman's daughter that was no
[20:31] good. don't make any difference. The
[20:32] grace of God saved you. It's sovereign.
[20:35] Has to It doesn't has to ask nobody
[20:37] nothing. And I'm so glad of that.
[20:39] Hallelujah. Can take the violet sinner
[20:42] and make him white as snow. Don't have
[20:43] to ask anybody about it. Oh, it can do
[20:46] it because it's sovereign.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Listen quickly now. That was proved at
[20:51] the cross when there was the vilest
[20:53] thief. He deserved to die. God had never
[20:55] come come across his mind. He never
[20:58] thought nothing of it. There on the
[21:00] cross through through his bloody lips in
[21:02] between the groans there came a sound.
[21:04] Lord be merciful to me. And there came
[21:07] another one back through uh blood,
[21:09] tears, agony, grace took a hold and
[21:11] said, "Today
[21:13] shalt thou be with me in paradise."
[21:15] Grace did that.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. How could that thief help himself?
[21:19] No more than Adam could help himself. No
[21:22] more than Eve could help herself. No
[21:23] more than you can help yourself. No more
[21:25] than I can help myself. No more than we
[21:28] could jerk ourselves up the milky white
[21:30] way with our bootstraps. We couldn't do
[21:32] it. But the grace of God can do
[21:34] something about it. And it does it. The
[21:36] grace of God, the sovereignty of the
[21:38] grace of God. Come to that dying thief
[21:40] today. Shalt thou be with me in
[21:43] paradise. Oh, think of it. That's
[21:45] wonderful.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; So, let's go and look at Luke chap 23
[21:50] together. And we're going to look at the
[21:52] story of the thief. Luke uh 23
[21:56] and verse 39.
[22:07] All right. Luke 23:39. And one of the
[22:10] malifactors which were hanging railed on
[22:12] him, saying, "If thou be Christ, save
[22:15] thyself and us." So we It's It's a
[22:18] picture we want to see. We've got Jesus
[22:20] Christ. Amen. And he's he's nailed to
[22:22] the cross. He's the propitiation. He's
[22:24] the sacrifice. He's there shedding his
[22:26] blood to pay the price of redemption to
[22:28] buy back all that was lost. And on one
[22:31] side is one malifactor, one thief, it
[22:33] says. And on the other side is another
[22:35] malifactor. Amen. And both of these
[22:37] people have lived vile lives and they're
[22:40] getting they're getting just fruits,
[22:42] rewards for their deeds.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; So neither one of them are clean living
[22:46] people.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; All right. It's a perfect picture. We
[22:50] want to see this picture. Amen. Because
[22:52] amen, we don't want to we don't want to
[22:54] find ourselves as the Pharisees walking
[22:56] in front of the cross wagging our heads.
[22:59] We want to find ourselves, Amen, nailed
[23:01] to the cross because of all of our sins.
[23:04] We want to find ourselves, Amen, under
[23:06] judgment because of all our false deeds.
[23:08] And the question is, which one of these
[23:10] thieves are you going to be?
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:17] All right. Now he comes on and says,
[23:22] "But the other," that's what the first
[23:24] thief said. "The other, but the other
[23:27] answered, rebuking him, saying, Dust
[23:29] thou, does thou, does not thou fear God,
[23:33] seeing thou art in the same
[23:34] condemnation? But we indeed justly, for
[23:38] we receive the due reward of our deeds.
[23:40] But this man hath done nothing a miss."
[23:43] And he said unto Jesus,"Lord,
[23:45] remember me when thou comest into thy
[23:47] kingdom." And Jesus said unto him,
[23:50] "Verily I say unto thee, today shalt
[23:52] thou be with me in paradise."
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this picture because in this
[23:59] picture you have the dying thief on the
[24:02] cross, two of them.
[24:04] And then you have the propitiation for
[24:06] sin standing in between of them or not
[24:09] standing, nailed in between of them. And
[24:12] in and in and the one malifactor, he
[24:14] he's he's just saying, you know, why
[24:16] don't you do some sign? Why don't you
[24:18] just save us? Why don't you just give it
[24:20] get us off of this cross? A and he's
[24:23] mocking the Lord and and he's telling
[24:24] them if you if you're so great, Amen.
[24:27] save us from this. But the other
[24:28] malifactor, he's not saying he's saying,
[24:31] you know, I I getting exactly what I
[24:33] deserve.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; I I've done this. He's done nothing
[24:37] wrong. Don't you fear God? And then he
[24:39] looks at Jesus and he says, "Lord,
[24:41] amen." He acknowledges who this is
[24:43] hanging on the cross that this is his
[24:45] Lord. Amen. And he says, "Remember me
[24:47] when thou come into thy kingdom." All of
[24:49] a sudden, his confession is, "I believe
[24:51] you're the Messiah. I believe you're
[24:53] coming to the kingdom. I believe you're
[24:55] the Lord." And all of a sudden, Amen.
[24:57] his faith was expressed in his
[24:59] confession. And he was saved by faith.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; There wasn't a thing he could do to get
[25:04] right first. There wasn't a thing he can
[25:06] do to live a clean life and come to the
[25:08] church. There wasn't anything he can do
[25:10] to straighten up what he had done wrong
[25:12] so that he was meat or worthy to meet
[25:14] the Lord and to go into paradise. He
[25:16] wasn't worthy to go into paradise. He
[25:18] didn't do any deed that would justify
[25:20] him entering into paradise. There's only
[25:22] one thing that he did that granted a
[25:24] pardon and that pardon came because he
[25:26] believed in the word for his day that
[25:29] was nailed there to the cross.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; What condemned the other one? The other
[25:34] thief was not condemned because he
[25:36] smoked, drank, swore, stole, committed
[25:39] whatever he committed. That's not why he
[25:41] didn't enter into paradise. He didn't
[25:43] enter paradise because when he had
[25:45] opportunity to come in contact with the
[25:46] word, he mocked it and railed against it
[25:49] and disbelieved.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Because they both had done the same
[25:55] deeds.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; They were both there for the same
[25:59] sedition. They were both there for the
[26:01] same for the same crime. Amen. And lived
[26:04] a similar life. How could one be saved
[26:06] and the other could not be saved? It was
[26:09] completely by grace. Amen. Well, what do
[26:11] you mean by grace? Why would God give
[26:13] grace to one and not the other? This is
[26:15] why God is just
[26:17] &gt;&gt; and the justifier. God cannot in order
[26:20] for God to be just, he doesn't just say,
[26:22] "I'm going to let you off, but I'm not
[26:24] going to let you off
[26:26] &gt;&gt; because that would violate his justice."
[26:30] But what he says is anybody that can
[26:32] believe in me, anybody that can receive
[26:35] my word, anybody that can accept me gets
[26:38] the benefit of me, which is Calvary.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Because the word was made flesh,
[26:45] &gt;&gt; dw among us. And that word, amen, was
[26:48] nailed to the cross. That word made
[26:50] flesh was crucified and bled and died
[26:53] for us to atone for us. And when every
[26:55] age when the believer was able to accept
[26:57] the word in their day, amen, they got
[26:59] the benefit of the word bleeding for
[27:01] them on Calvary.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't because of we did good
[27:06] deeds.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; I mean, read the Bible.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; They didn't always do good deeds.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; I mean, they did good some good deeds,
[27:15] but they did some bad deeds, too. And
[27:17] the bad deeds were worthy of punishment.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; But why were why were they able to
[27:22] bypass? Why were they why why when uh
[27:25] Jesus died, Amen. Why was there a
[27:28] resurrection of the saints of old and
[27:30] and many that were in the grave slept?
[27:32] Amen. Not all but many. Who were those
[27:34] that came forth? They were the ones who
[27:36] were able to accept the word for their
[27:39] day.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; They were able to accept Christ for
[27:42] their day, the anointed word in their
[27:44] day. And they held to it despite all
[27:46] opposition. They didn't live a perfect
[27:48] life, but they believed the word and
[27:49] held to the the faith they had in that
[27:51] word. And that faith was a gift of God.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; It was God's grace. Amen. To give them
[27:56] the ability to believe the word. And by
[27:58] faith, they were justified.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Amenise
[28:02] &gt;&gt; when the price was paid.
[28:04] So, so when we look at the two thieves
[28:08] on the cross,
[28:10] listen, when it comes to the Lord, I I
[28:12] don't want to be the church member out
[28:14] in front.
[28:16] I want to find myself as one of these
[28:19] two thieves.
[28:21] guilty as charged.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Before salvation, condemned to die,
[28:31] &gt;&gt; because every one of us has exercised
[28:34] our free moral agency to choose sin.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; There's not one of us who've passed
[28:40] through life and not forsaken the word.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; We've exercised the free choice God gave
[28:47] us. And many times we chose the wrong
[28:49] thing. and for exercising our free moral
[28:51] agency and choosing the wrong thing. We
[28:53] are condemned. We've condemned
[28:55] ourselves.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; But I'm so thankful that there's a way
[28:58] to be free.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; And that way is through the blood of
[29:01] Jesus Christ. And access to that grace
[29:04] is by faith.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; But that not of ourselves.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; It is a gift of God.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; So that's so for me so important to
[29:15] remember that it's not what we did. It's
[29:18] it's the faith that God believe us to
[29:20] latch on to his word. And that's what
[29:23] brings us into life. That's what brings
[29:25] us brings us into that place where we
[29:27] can be justified by his grace. And so
[29:32] that's how we all begin our journey and
[29:34] that's how we move into this great
[29:36] revelation of of the grace of God by his
[29:39] mercies. And so as we continue on, I
[29:42] want to build on that and and keep
[29:44] looking at what brother Benham says
[29:46] because we know that we preached on on
[29:49] uh on Wednesday.
[29:52] Amen. I never know what day of the week
[29:54] it is. We preached on Wednesday that
[29:57] that the strength of God's grace was
[29:59] stronger than our failure.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; It was stronger than our
[30:02] misunderstanding. It was stronger than
[30:04] our backslide. His grace has been
[30:06] stronger than anything that we could do.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he was able to save us.
[30:13] Amen. So now we want to look at our
[30:15] response to that grace. What is the
[30:17] response to grace? If we look at this uh
[30:21] quote here from the prophet of God, he
[30:22] says, "Yet that's the same thing that
[30:24] stands today. Men and women can go to
[30:27] church and have the long face and pious
[30:29] as they can be and never lie, steal, and
[30:33] try to live the religion as best they
[30:34] can, but unless they are believers,
[30:37] they're lost." Right.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; That's so important. Brother's trying to
[30:41] show us that it's not just doing right.
[30:44] It's not just coming under a code of
[30:46] operation and keeping all the ordinances
[30:48] of the church and doing all of that.
[30:50] That's all fine. Amen. But that doesn't
[30:52] mean you're saved.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Unless you are a believer, you're lost.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; So there's no scratch of legalist in the
[31:01] Bible.
[31:03] Calvinism is grace is what God did for
[31:05] you and works is what you do for God.
[31:08] It's absolutely separated.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; And now this is what I want to start
[31:12] talking about today. It's something that
[31:14] we all know very well. But grace is
[31:17] unmmerited. Grace is based off God's
[31:19] love. Grace is what God did for me.
[31:21] Amen. Despite any action from me. Amen.
[31:25] And and the and the and the the path the
[31:28] connection to that grace is through
[31:29] faith.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's a gift of God.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then what about works? Why are
[31:36] there commandments in the Bible? Why
[31:38] does God tell us to do stuff? Why does
[31:40] Paul tell the church to do this and
[31:42] don't do that? Why did brother Benham
[31:43] come and tell us the mind of God that he
[31:45] wants this and he doesn't want that? Why
[31:47] all of that if that doesn't matter for
[31:49] salvation?
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because brother Brennan breaks it
[31:55] down and he's going to keep breaking
[31:56] down as we go. Grace is what God did for
[31:59] me and works is what I do for God.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; And he says they're totally separate. We
[32:05] don't want to mix one of these into the
[32:06] other. I don't want to mix my works into
[32:09] salvation because then when I fail in my
[32:11] works, I question my salvation.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't do any good to mix legalism
[32:15] into grace. Amen. Because as soon as we
[32:17] do, we start to go up and down and back
[32:19] and forth. And we're saved one day and
[32:21] not saved the next day. And we have no
[32:23] stability to keep pressing on because
[32:25] we're constantly two steps forward and a
[32:27] step back.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? We still live in a
[32:31] hybrid condition. We still can be
[32:33] tempted by the world. We still can and
[32:35] and make all kinds of mistakes. We make
[32:37] them all the time. Amen. But that's why
[32:39] there has to be a separation of grace
[32:42] and a separation of works. And we're and
[32:44] you come to it from two completely
[32:45] different angles. Amen. want is
[32:47] something that God did for me completely
[32:50] independent of my works.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Completely independent of my merit, my
[32:55] worth, or anything that I could do in
[32:56] the flesh. It's completely separated.
[32:58] It's 100% what God has done for me.
[33:01] Amen. But over here, amen. My response
[33:03] to that love and my response to that
[33:05] grace is a desire in my heart to please
[33:08] him, to do anything I can for him. He
[33:10] gave his life for me. Now there's
[33:11] something in me that wants to give my
[33:13] life back to him.
[33:15] And those things, brother said, are
[33:17] separate, but they go together. So,
[33:19] we'll talk about that.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; He says, if you quit lying, quit
[33:23] smoking, quit stealing, quit committing
[33:25] adultery, quit all, done everything,
[33:27] keep the commandments, and went to
[33:29] church, baptized every Sunday, took the
[33:31] communion, washed the feets of the
[33:32] saints, done everything, healed the
[33:34] sick, and done all these other things.
[33:36] Unless you're born of the spirit of God,
[33:38] elected, you're lost.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Not him that willth, nor him that runth,
[33:43] but God that showeth mercy. So the
[33:46] prophet uses this scripture. Amen. So we
[33:48] know
[33:50] uh we know that it was God's will. Amen.
[33:54] Not our will.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean we don't have a
[33:57] will.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; But no matter how much we want to be
[34:03] saved, Amen. If if God doesn't will, it
[34:06] wasn't God's will to show mercy. It's
[34:08] not him that willth nor him that runth,
[34:10] but God that showeth mercy.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; But we have a will. And what is our
[34:14] will? and how would he exercise our
[34:16] will? The prophet of God told us you
[34:17] have to will to do the will of God. You
[34:19] have to have a desire to want to serve
[34:21] him.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; And to me, that's an appropriate
[34:24] response to grace.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; And so, we're going to talk about that
[34:29] in Romans 8
[34:32] 29. He says, "For whom he did forno, he
[34:35] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[34:37] the image of his son, that he might be
[34:39] the firstborn among many brethren.
[34:41] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[34:43] he also called. Whom he called, then he
[34:45] also justified. Whom he justified, then
[34:48] he also glorified. What shall we then
[34:50] say to these things? If God before us,
[34:53] who can be against us?
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that scripture.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; If God has already determined, Amen. is
[34:59] he already by fornowledge predestinated
[35:01] me to be conformed to the image of his
[35:03] son? Praise God. Amen. I've got the mind
[35:05] of God and the will of God on my side.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; And whom he predestinated,
[35:11] he also called. whom he called, he
[35:13] justified. Whom he justified, he also
[35:15] glor in and God, it's a finished work.
[35:18] Amen. In the mind of God, you've already
[35:20] been glorified. It's a finished work.
[35:22] We're just here acting out what was in
[35:23] his mind. And so, praise God. If if I'm
[35:26] already arrived, Amen. then I'm not
[35:29] trying to arrive.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; But I'm just here fleshing out what God
[35:35] has already determined in his mind.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; So, what shall we say to these things?
[35:39] If God gone before us, who can be
[35:40] against us? And then he starts going
[35:42] down into who can condemn us? Who can
[35:44] lay a charge to the elect of God? How
[35:46] can you accuse them of anything? For
[35:47] Christ died for them. Christ paid for
[35:49] them. Amen. How how can you blame them?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; I mean, we can look at deeds done and
[35:54] say, "I that was wrong and this is wrong
[35:56] and that's not right." But how do you
[35:58] condemn them to hell? How do you tell
[36:00] them they're not a believer and they're
[36:01] a sinner when Christ paid the price of
[36:03] redemption?
[36:05] &gt;&gt; So, if God is for us, who can be against
[36:07] us?
[36:08] In the message of grace,
[36:11] the says, "Think of it. Love and grace
[36:13] is sisters." We read this Wednesday
[36:14] night. Twin sisters. You can't have
[36:17] grace without having love. They're twin
[36:19] sisters. That's exactly right. Before
[36:20] you can have grace, you have to have
[36:22] love. Before you can actually show
[36:23] somebody a favor, you love them. Right
[36:26] or wrong, you have to love them anyhow
[36:30] or you can't see. So, love and grace is
[36:32] the same thing. They're just twin
[36:34] sisters, that's all. Love and grace.
[36:36] There's one quote of the prophet where
[36:38] he says grace is love
[36:40] &gt;&gt; because it's the expression of love.
[36:42] It's God showing favor with without
[36:45] merit because based on his love.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; And that's where his election is based
[36:50] on a love and the proof of his love is
[36:52] found in election because God loved us.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; In marriage and divorce,
[36:59] brother Bram says it's just like today.
[37:01] There are two great schools of doctrine
[37:03] in the church. One of them is Calvinism.
[37:05] The other one is Armenianism.
[37:08] One of them is legalist and the other
[37:09] one is grace. And we come to find out
[37:12] that people who believe in grace, the
[37:14] Calvinist say, "Bless God. It don't hurt
[37:16] me to smoke. It don't hurt me to drink.
[37:18] I can do these things. I've got eternal
[37:20] security." Then we find the other side
[37:23] on the legalist said, "Oh, I would like
[37:25] to ball him out. I would like to show
[37:27] him a piece of my mind, but I'm a
[37:28] Christian. I have to keep still." See,
[37:31] you find yourself on two different roads
[37:33] and neither one of them is right.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; I I love this.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And here's the problem. The
[37:40] problem is human reasoning.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; So that first part of of Calvinism of of
[37:45] of what would be extreme grace or what
[37:48] goes beyond the scriptures in grace,
[37:50] Amen. is is the the thought, well, if
[37:53] without merit, he saved me and I'm saved
[37:55] by his grace apart from my works and
[37:57] it's not of works but only his faith. So
[37:59] if I believe in him, that's all I need.
[38:01] So now it doesn't matter what kind of
[38:03] life I live. Amen. Because of his grace.
[38:07] And you see how slick the devil is
[38:10] because there's a truth there. There is
[38:11] something that is true that they're
[38:13] talking about because it was never based
[38:15] on your merit. And even your mistakes do
[38:17] not put you outside of God's love and
[38:19] grace.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; So they're right. The problem is, Amen.
[38:23] I'm just going to let brother say it
[38:25] here in a few minutes, but the problem
[38:26] of it is, Amen. You're using human
[38:29] reasoning and human logic and you're
[38:31] responding to a gospel truth and human
[38:33] reasoning and now you've perverted the
[38:35] truth of the gospel
[38:37] &gt;&gt; by human reasoning.
[38:40] Now, brother Bram's going to tell us how
[38:42] this works and I think it's so beautiful
[38:44] because the simplicity of the word is
[38:46] always so good. He says, now the last
[38:50] thing he said in the quote here was,
[38:51] "And neither one of them is right." So,
[38:53] I'm going to pick up and read from where
[38:55] he left off.
[38:57] Now, this is hard to say that, but it's
[38:59] the truth. We find ourselves on two
[39:02] different roads. One going one way, one
[39:05] another. Now, let's see what the truth
[39:07] is. So, the prophet of God constantly
[39:10] had a ministry that would pull from both
[39:12] sides, back to this gospel truth, back
[39:15] to the Bible. And he said, "Now, let's
[39:17] see what the truth is." So, now he's
[39:19] going to tell us what the truth is. So
[39:22] listen, this debate has been going on
[39:24] for quite some time between Calvinism
[39:26] and Armenianism. Amen. There were
[39:28] different schools of thought. Amen.
[39:30] Calvinism, Amen, went into grace and
[39:32] then and it went extreme. It went into
[39:34] extreme grace. Amen. So then Armenianism
[39:38] was fighting back against the extreme
[39:40] grace and saying, "No, you have a
[39:41] choice. You have to choose. You have to
[39:43] live right. You have to do right. You
[39:45] can be an outcast from the economy of
[39:47] God if you don't obey God's word." Amen.
[39:49] And these two things, amen, that this is
[39:51] where the Wesleyan movement came in and
[39:53] started with Methodism and the works
[39:55] program. Amen. Was Armenianism. And
[39:57] brother Brenham said they had to come
[39:59] and strike a blowup against Calvinism
[40:01] because it needed a blowstruck against
[40:03] them. It was too far one way. And God
[40:05] brought Wesley and Methodism to
[40:06] counterbalance it.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; God,
[40:08] &gt;&gt; but he said then they went too far the
[40:10] other way. Amen. Right.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; So, this debate has been going on and
[40:14] it's been going on in theological
[40:16] circles and there's been scriptures
[40:17] tossed around to and back and forth and
[40:20] everybody every theologian who holds
[40:22] their position has his stack of
[40:23] scriptures that he can use to support
[40:25] his scripture his his position and
[40:27] they've been doing theological studies
[40:29] and they've been doing papers and
[40:30] they've been doing PhD programs on the
[40:33] debate between Calvinism and
[40:35] Armenianism. Which one is right? So here
[40:38] God sends a prophet with a seventh grade
[40:40] education and he's going to settle the
[40:42] question with a theological discussion.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; And here's how he does it.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Now listen and see if this sounds
[40:53] sensible to you.
[40:56] Now get ready. We're going to have an
[40:58] essay, theological essay on which is
[41:00] right, Calvin's Armenianism.
[41:04] For instance, if I get ready to go
[41:05] overseas and I take my own family and I
[41:08] call my wife up to me and I'll say, "I'm
[41:10] going overseas, dear." Now, here is the
[41:13] legalist side. Now, my wife, I'm going
[41:16] to lay the law down to you. If you flirt
[41:18] with any man while I'm gone, when I come
[41:20] back, you're a divorced woman. And I
[41:23] don't want you to make eyes. Don't uh
[41:25] don't want you to flirting. You
[41:27] understand that I'm your husband. If you
[41:28] if you do it, I'm going to put you away
[41:31] when I come back.
[41:32] Then she reaches and gets me by the tie
[41:35] and says, "My good man, I'm going to
[41:36] tell you something. See, that if you
[41:38] make eyes at any woman or take any woman
[41:41] out or flirt with any woman, you're
[41:43] going to be a divorced man when you come
[41:44] back." Now, wouldn't that be a happy
[41:46] home? That's legalist. So now he
[41:49] explained the Armenian side.
[41:52] I mean, was that complicated
[41:56] theological discussion on the truth of
[41:59] the scripture?
[42:01] Then he says,"Now the other side is that
[42:04] if I go overseas and I make a mistake,
[42:07] go over and say, 'Now look, I'll take
[42:10] this woman out. Oh, it's all right with
[42:12] my wife. She don't care. My wife says,
[42:14] "I'll go out with this man. It's all
[42:16] right with Bill. He don't care. If I
[42:18] don't care, then there's something wrong
[42:20] with me. I don't love that woman, right?
[42:22] And if she don't care, there's something
[42:24] wrong with her. She's my wife. I don't
[42:26] want other men fooling with her. She's
[42:29] my wife.
[42:30] Now the correct way of it is all right
[42:34] are you listening
[42:36] &gt;&gt; now the correct way of it is there's
[42:38] both of them has got a truth but not the
[42:41] exact truth
[42:42] &gt;&gt; so brother Bam just gave us two examples
[42:45] to explain Calvinism and Armenianism and
[42:47] he didn't use any difficult words
[42:51] &gt;&gt; we didn't have to have a degree to
[42:53] understand what he's saying and we
[42:54] didn't even have to use our dictionary
[42:57] &gt;&gt; right so now he says both of these have
[43:00] a truth, but they're both wrong.
[43:03] And he's going to show us the correct
[43:04] way. Now, here's the correct way. When I
[43:07] go overseas to make it right, my little
[43:10] family gathers around and we pray with
[43:12] one another and I commit them to God and
[43:14] they commit me to God. And when we do,
[43:16] we go overseas. I go overseas. Now, I
[43:19] know she loves me. I have confidence in
[43:21] her and I love her. She's got confidence
[43:23] in me. And as long as I love her like
[43:25] that, she don't have any worry about me
[43:27] taking any other woman out. as long as
[43:29] she loves me right, why there is no need
[43:31] of me thinking about any other man going
[43:33] out with her because she's my wife and I
[43:35] believe her. I believe if I would
[43:38] actually do something wrong, make a
[43:40] mistake and go out with some woman and
[43:42] return back and would confess it to her
[43:44] and tell her ma I didn't mean to do
[43:46] that. I just got caught in a trap. This
[43:49] woman just run up to me and grabbed me
[43:51] by the arm and started so and so. I
[43:54] believe she would be understanding. I
[43:56] believe she would forgive me for it. But
[43:58] I wouldn't do it for nothing because I
[44:00] love her.
[44:02] Though she would forgive me, I wouldn't
[44:04] do it. I wouldn't hurt her for nothing.
[44:06] Though I know she would forgive me for
[44:08] it, I don't want to hurt her. And that's
[44:11] the way it is with God.
[44:15] If filio love, which is human love,
[44:17] fellowship love, can make a man feel
[44:19] that about his wife, what about agapeio
[44:21] love, the Greek word, which means the
[44:22] love of God, how would that make me do
[44:24] about Jesus Christ? As long as I want to
[44:27] go do it, it's in my heart to do. And as
[44:30] long as it's in my heart to do it, I I
[44:33] go do it. Legalism won't let me do it.
[44:36] Is because that I I know I'd get
[44:38] punished for doing it. But the real
[44:40] truth of it is is when the love of God
[44:42] comes into your heart till you want to
[44:44] do it. That's the truth of it. There's
[44:46] the two schools. Not legalism or the
[44:48] other or Calvinism. It's both.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So listen, don't rail on the
[44:57] Calvinist.
[44:58] They got truth.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Don't rail on the Armenianism.
[45:02] Armenianist. They've got truth. Brother
[45:04] Benham said they both got truth. He
[45:06] says, "Which is it? Calvinism or
[45:08] Armenian?" both.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; And the reality of it is that the grace
[45:13] of God and what God has done for me puts
[45:15] such a love in my heart and such a trust
[45:17] for him who loved me so much. My
[45:19] reciprocal love for him. Amen. It it
[45:22] changes me in the on the inside to where
[45:24] I don't want to hurt him. I don't want
[45:26] to displease him. I don't want I don't
[45:29] want to I I I don't want to hurt him in
[45:31] any way. I don't want to hurt his name.
[45:33] I don't want to hurt his image. I I
[45:35] don't want to hurt his reputation.
[45:36] Everything about me doesn't want to do
[45:38] it. So I restrain the desires of my
[45:41] flesh. Not because I'm going to go to
[45:43] hell. Not because I'm going to get
[45:45] punished. Not because church people will
[45:47] find out. But I restrain the lust of the
[45:49] flesh because I don't want to do
[45:51] anything to displease my Lord who by
[45:53] grace has saved me despite my merit.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; And we know, I mean, we know good and
[46:01] well that God, he's promised to forgive
[46:04] us of all of our sins. I know God will
[46:06] forgive me if I make a mistake. I
[46:08] believe with all my heart that God will
[46:10] forgive me if I repent. But that doesn't
[46:12] lead me into premeditated sin. That
[46:16] doesn't lead me into fulfilling the lust
[46:18] of the flesh by a concept that I know
[46:20] that he'll forgive me. He has to forgive
[46:22] me anyways. So because he has to forgive
[46:24] me, I'm going to intentionally fulfill
[46:26] this lust of the flesh because now God
[46:28] has to forgive me. Amen. That thinking
[46:31] is a wrong understanding of grace. Amen.
[46:33] something in our relationship with the
[46:35] Lord has to go deeper.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Because it's got to be like marriage.
[46:39] It's got to come to the place where if
[46:41] if brother Bam said, "If I believe if I
[46:42] got caught in a trap and I got stuck in
[46:44] a situation and I made a foolish
[46:46] decision, if I come back to my wife, I
[46:48] believe with all my heart that she would
[46:50] forgive me, this is brother Bam
[46:51] talking." Amen. But he says, "But I
[46:53] wouldn't do anything in the world to
[46:55] hurt her." Amen. There's nothing in me
[46:57] that wants to hurt her. And he said,
[46:59] "That's the truth of it."
[47:02] Amen.
[47:03] Praise God. I think to me one of the one
[47:08] of the uh the the greatest tragedies I
[47:11] it's in marriage too but in our
[47:13] relationship with the Lord is
[47:15] selfishness.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; When when I look at this selfishness
[47:22] that I do something knowing it's going
[47:25] to hurt my wife but I do it anyways
[47:27] because we're already married. She took
[47:28] a vow. She has to forgive me. She can't
[47:31] leave me anyhow. And so I'm going to do
[47:33] what I want to do anyways, knowing it
[47:35] hurts her, but knowing that she has to
[47:37] forgive me.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, if that's the truth, then I
[47:43] don't love that woman the way I should
[47:44] love her.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; If that's the way I think I do not love
[47:49] that woman, right? I love myself more
[47:51] than I love her.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; And listen, uh, none of us should have,
[47:57] I hope none of us did, choose our wives.
[48:00] Amen. Based off their application.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; I mean, how many of you took
[48:05] application? I got 10 applicants. I
[48:07] mean, some of us were lucky to find one
[48:09] who we begged to say yes. I mean, so we
[48:11] may not have got 10 applicants. Amen.
[48:14] But you didn't go through the
[48:15] application. Okay, she's got this much
[48:17] education and this and she can bake this
[48:19] and she knows so many recipes. My
[48:22] goodness, when it come down to getting
[48:23] married, I didn't care if she knew any
[48:25] recipes. I didn't care if she burned
[48:26] everything that came out of the oven.
[48:27] There was something in my heart that
[48:29] loved her and had to have her regardless
[48:31] of anything else. I didn't care if she
[48:33] could cook, if she could clean. I didn't
[48:34] care. I didn't care if she had education
[48:36] or money or anything. That didn't matter
[48:38] to me. What mattered to me was her. I
[48:41] was in love with her, not her attributes
[48:44] or abilities or
[48:45] &gt;&gt; accomplishments. I was in love with her.
[48:51] So it was never about merit. It was
[48:55] always about love.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then once I married that
[49:00] woman, Amen. I loved her so much. Amen.
[49:03] Then there was then as soon as you get
[49:05] married, the moment you're married, you
[49:07] no longer live for self. You live for
[49:09] spouse. And the days of doing whatever I
[49:12] want to do whenever I want to do it are
[49:13] gone out the window. Yeah.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; And we can take a you can take a
[49:17] chauvinistic idea and say, "Well, I'm
[49:19] the man. I'm the head of the house. I
[49:20] make decision." Blah blah blah blah
[49:22] blah. Well, yeah, that's the truth. It's
[49:24] your responsibility for the home. You're
[49:26] the one who makes the decision. You make
[49:27] leadership. But if you take that
[49:29] attitude towards it with unconsideration
[49:31] of somebody else and only considering
[49:34] yourself and your selfishness, amen,
[49:36] you've taken the word of God and you
[49:37] perverted it for your own use and you're
[49:39] no longer reflecting Christ. Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how many scriptures
[49:43] you quote and how right you are about
[49:46] headship if you take the wrong concept
[49:48] because remember the logos is the word
[49:51] with the including the thought God's
[49:53] thought when he mentioned it and when he
[49:54] put a man under uh to take the headship
[49:57] of a woman he was wanting man to reflect
[49:59] Christ's relationship with the church
[50:03] &gt;&gt; and when we start to by selfishness and
[50:05] arrogancy and start to say my way or the
[50:08] highway and I'm the man you do what I
[50:10] say with no consideration for the heart,
[50:13] for the love of a wife, then you've just
[50:15] taken the scriptures and perverted them
[50:18] &gt;&gt; and manifestation.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; But the moment we're married, all of the
[50:23] sudden, Amen. My a friend calls up, hey,
[50:27] you want to go here today? I mean, uh,
[50:30] you know, months before before we
[50:32] started the relationship, it was whether
[50:34] I wanted to go or not. It was all about
[50:36] my own feeling. Do I want to go out with
[50:38] my buddy tonight to dinner? Or do I not
[50:40] want to go out with my buddy tonight to
[50:41] dinner? But the moment I'm married and
[50:43] enter into this love covenant, this
[50:45] relationship, as soon as my buddy asks
[50:47] me, I'm starting to think, what do we
[50:48] have tonight? What is my wife got? Is it
[50:50] going to be okay with her? Would it be a
[50:52] hardship with her? Put her out in any
[50:53] way. Is this a responsible thing to do
[50:55] for her?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; And now I'm restraining my own desires
[51:01] and my own passions. Why? because I have
[51:04] a greater love than the love I have for
[51:06] myself. It's the love I have for my
[51:07] wife.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram took such a deep theological
[51:13] subject
[51:15] and he broke it down so simple.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; This is the way it's supposed to work
[51:21] that I will restrain my desires. I will
[51:25] tell myself no. Listen, don't think
[51:28] because you're saved and born again and
[51:29] filled with the Holy Ghost, every
[51:30] thought that passes through your mind is
[51:32] God and every desire you have is holy.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Don't you dare. Don't trust your flesh
[51:37] for a second.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Don't be deceived by that.
[51:43] Amen. But the relationship is correct.
[51:47] what what I do my works that I do for
[51:50] God the self-restraint the obedience to
[51:52] the word the giving up even uh uh
[51:55] desires of the flesh for God telling
[51:58] myself no amen that is because I love
[52:02] him and I want to please him not so I
[52:05] can go to heaven
[52:08] not not so I can get a reward and not
[52:12] because I'm afraid of punishment
[52:15] &gt;&gt; but simply because If he said it,
[52:18] there's a good reason he said it. And I
[52:19] love him and I trust him.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; I trust his word. I trust what he taught
[52:24] us. And I trust what he taught us
[52:26] through a prophet.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; I trust it. I don't think God would send
[52:29] a prophet and that prophet would start
[52:31] screaming out against different sins and
[52:33] different things that were going on in
[52:34] the Leoian church age. I don't think he
[52:36] would do that. Amen. And make himself
[52:38] untrustworthy unless that's exactly what
[52:41] was in his mind.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:43] I believe I can trust him and even he
[52:45] even who he chooses to be the prophet of
[52:47] the age.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; I can trust his voice.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; And then there's something in me that
[52:54] wants to do his will.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And listen, let's let's not be childish
[53:00] either. Let's not think that you'll
[53:03] never have another desire.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Because we're still in flesh.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; We still have a carnal human spirit. You
[53:11] can still your body can still want
[53:13] something, but that doesn't mean that
[53:16] you want it.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Let's let's let's say that again slowly.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Your body can still scra and want
[53:26] something, but that doesn't mean you
[53:27] want it.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Because who's the real you? It's that
[53:33] seed gene of God on the inside. that
[53:34] it's that child of God that's been born
[53:36] again and is still living in a vessel of
[53:39] clay that was born under perversion and
[53:41] still has influence from the world.
[53:43] Amen. So, so listen, I I I'll give you
[53:46] this example. I'll give you another
[53:47] highly theological one because brother
[53:48] Brandon went so deep. I'll give you
[53:51] another one. Amen. I found that as I as
[53:54] I age,
[53:57] not old, but I can't say young.
[54:01] somewhere in the middle.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; I can't handle sugar and carbs like I
[54:05] used to.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's wrong with my
[54:09] metabolism. My body's completely
[54:11] backsliden and perverted and it doesn't
[54:13] work right anymore. But anyways,
[54:15] &gt;&gt; amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; So, the reality is I've made a decision
[54:19] that if I'm going to be healthy and if
[54:22] I'm going to have longevity and I know
[54:24] God can pull my card at any time, but
[54:27] I've got to make some choices. Amen. for
[54:29] the right reasons. Amen. So that I can
[54:31] be productive and I can be healthy and I
[54:33] can be there for my family and I can be
[54:34] here for the church. So I have to avoid
[54:37] sugar and carbs
[54:39] &gt;&gt; because I know that that's not going to
[54:41] lead me down the right road. That
[54:42] there's a danger at the end of that.
[54:44] Amen. And you might be able to handle
[54:45] them fine, but I can't handle them very
[54:47] well at all.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; That does not mean I don't want sugar
[54:53] and carbs.
[54:57] You set out a whole load of pies and you
[55:01] get the fruit pies and the stuff that I
[55:02] like and you and and and the small
[55:06] family brings ice cream.
[55:11] It's a lovehate relationship, brother.
[55:15] I love it. I hate it. I love it. I hate
[55:17] it.
[55:19] It doesn't mean I don't want it. It
[55:22] doesn't mean I don't have a craving for
[55:23] it. And just because I have a craving
[55:25] for it doesn't mean I have to cave into
[55:26] my craving and take it like my craving's
[55:28] right. But there's something else inside
[55:30] of me, a true me that says I don't want
[55:32] to go down that path because that path
[55:34] is not good. It's not healthy. It's
[55:36] going to harm me in the long run. So
[55:38] there's part of me that has to overcome
[55:40] another part of me.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, have you ever stood in front of
[55:44] the fridge and fought with yourself?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Like you're nuts. Like there's two
[55:49] people. Like you really got the devil
[55:51] and an angel on either shoulder while
[55:53] you're standing there. Do it. Don't do
[55:54] it. Do it. Don't Don't do it. I You
[55:56] know, I'll walk an extra mile tomorrow.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; But yet I I make a decision not because
[56:08] I don't want it, but because I don't
[56:10] want it.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; I want it, but I don't want it.
[56:18] Has
[56:20] &gt;&gt; anybody ever been in that spot?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; I want it, but I don't want it.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now you can your body can
[56:28] crave something or or or or look at
[56:30] something or be attracted to something,
[56:32] but there's something else that's been
[56:33] born again on the inside that wants
[56:35] nothing to do with that. Nothing to do
[56:36] with the world. Doesn't have an
[56:38] attraction to it. Doesn't have a desire
[56:40] for it. Doesn't want it at all.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's stronger than just a desire
[56:46] not to eat or not that. It's a
[56:47] born-again experience that really at the
[56:49] root of you, there's nothing in you that
[56:51] wants the world. There's nothing in that
[56:53] seed that wants anything to do with
[56:55] Satan's Eden. Amen. Any desire comes
[56:57] from the outside man, not the new man,
[56:59] because that's a new creature with new
[57:00] desires.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And that's the me that wants to reign in
[57:06] the flesh. That's the me that tells
[57:07] myself, "No, that's the me that says
[57:10] that's not pleasing to the Lord. We're
[57:12] not going to entertain that thought.
[57:13] We're not going to say those things.
[57:15] We're not going to go to those places.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:20] Praise be to God.
[57:22] Brother Benham says this in Luke 7:47.
[57:25] He says, "Wherefore I say unto thee, her
[57:27] sins which are many are forgiven, for
[57:29] she loved much, but to whom little is
[57:32] forgiven, the same loveth little."
[57:37] This is why I said it's better to find
[57:39] ourselves when we start our journey with
[57:41] Christ as one of the thieves on the
[57:43] cross. Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Because when we realize what we are
[57:49] before redemption,
[57:51] Amen. We realize we were hopeless.
[57:54] We could never do anything to save
[57:57] ourselves. We were as lost as loss could
[57:59] be in this world, in this humanity.
[58:02] Amen. But the grace of God is what saved
[58:04] us.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; And if we could find ourselves as the
[58:07] thief on the cross, amen, that could
[58:09] just say, "Lord, I I'm condemned. I'm
[58:12] guilty. I've done everything wrong. A
[58:15] and there's nothing in me that's right.
[58:17] Amen. But Lord,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; when you come into your kingdom,
[58:21] remember me.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just implore him. Amen. And
[58:25] then receive his mercy and receive his
[58:27] grace in our lives. And then, you know,
[58:31] I love this. This is the woman who
[58:32] washed Jesus' feet in Simon's house.
[58:34] Simon was a religious man who had, let's
[58:37] say, he had his home in order and his
[58:38] ducks in a row. And he didn't realize
[58:40] the depravity of his heart because he
[58:42] didn't believe in the Messiah. He didn't
[58:44] believe how lo he didn't understand how
[58:45] lost he was. Amen. But this woman who
[58:48] was a ranked sinner, she knew exactly
[58:50] how bad off she was. She knew exactly
[58:52] how hopeless her case was. And she knew
[58:54] exactly Amen. She wasn't accepted in the
[58:57] church. She wasn't even welcome into
[58:58] Simon's house because of her dirty life.
[59:00] Amen. So, she knew full well what she
[59:02] was. But she wasn't looking at what she
[59:04] was. She was looking at who this was
[59:06] that's sitting here. And this is the
[59:08] Messiah. This is Christ. This is the
[59:10] Lord.
[59:12] And she just listen. She just went in
[59:15] love to serve him.
[59:18] She didn't go for reward. She went for
[59:20] love.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; There was a revelation in her heart.
[59:23] Brother Benham said she just thought in
[59:25] her heart, I've got to get to him. What
[59:28] was moving her? There was a seed on the
[59:30] inside. Amen. That was pulsating when
[59:32] the word was made flesh in front of her.
[59:34] There was a reaction on the inside and
[59:36] she just had to get to him. It wasn't
[59:38] about I think he'll give me money, he'll
[59:40] give me a reward, he'll bail me out of
[59:42] my bad life. That I don't think those
[59:44] were preconceived ideas. There was
[59:46] something in her that had to respond to
[59:48] the word. And when she responded to the
[59:50] word, her action was an act of her faith
[59:53] that she believed that this was the
[59:54] Messiah and worthy to have his feet
[59:56] washed and he was rejected by everybody
[59:58] else. But something in her could not
[1:00:00] reject that man sitting there.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she was as filthy as filthy
[1:00:05] can be. She was the most unworthy person
[1:00:07] to wash his feet. She was less worthy
[1:00:10] than the footwash flunky that was the
[1:00:12] servant of of of Simon.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; But yet by faith by by an inspiration by
[1:00:22] something that was moving within her,
[1:00:24] she had to get to him. And when she got
[1:00:26] to him expressing her faith in him and
[1:00:28] wept at his feet and did a service unto
[1:00:30] him, Jesus said,
[1:00:34] Simon,
[1:00:36] her sins which are many
[1:00:39] are all forgiven her.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, Simon
[1:00:49] Simon prepared a feast. Simon invited
[1:00:52] the Lord. Simon fed him. Simon did a
[1:00:54] service to the Lord,
[1:00:57] but his service to the Lord didn't get
[1:00:59] him anything
[1:01:01] because it wasn't based on faith. It was
[1:01:05] just works.
[1:01:08] This woman, she did the Lord a service,
[1:01:11] but it had nothing to do with reward and
[1:01:14] it had nothing to do it had everything
[1:01:16] to do with faith.
[1:01:19] And what did she receive?
[1:01:21] She received forgiveness of her sins.
[1:01:24] She was saved.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then brother Brandham or And
[1:01:29] then the Lord Jesus Christ teaches us.
[1:01:31] He says, "Listen,
[1:01:34] her sins which are many are forgiven
[1:01:38] for she loved much. But to whom little
[1:01:41] is forgiven, the same loveth little."
[1:01:45] Oh, if I if if I could just make this
[1:01:48] scripture more more real to me,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; if we could really realize what we are
[1:01:55] left to ourselves
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; and how destitute and how broken and how
[1:02:01] how our heart is failed and when we are
[1:02:04] completely failed without Christ. If it
[1:02:06] wasn't for his grace, we are hopeless.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; We're all on the same page. Hopeless.
[1:02:14] Not that I have some willpower that can.
[1:02:16] No. Hopeless.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for his grace, without
[1:02:19] grace, we wouldn't have faith to
[1:02:21] believe. Without faith to believe, we
[1:02:22] would never come to. We are hopeless.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; That's where this woman was.
[1:02:29] I don't want to be of those that feel
[1:02:33] like God chose me to be his bride
[1:02:36] because I was pretty good and I was
[1:02:38] already loving his word, so he just gave
[1:02:40] me a little more. So, I just came into
[1:02:41] the kingdom. Because that kind of love
[1:02:44] loveth back little.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. That's right.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; But but the one who realized and this is
[1:02:52] the one I want to be. The one who
[1:02:53] realizes I was a hopeless case. I was
[1:02:56] destined for hell. Every decision I made
[1:02:58] was a wrong decision. I had no ability
[1:03:00] to save myself or help myself. I kept
[1:03:02] falling into the same traps and I would
[1:03:04] for the rest of my life until I utterly
[1:03:06] ruined my life. Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; If it was not for his grace, if it
[1:03:11] wasn't for him coming to me, if it
[1:03:12] wasn't for him giving me a seed of
[1:03:14] faith, if it wasn't for him, I'd be
[1:03:15] completely lost. And when I realize how
[1:03:17] destitute I was and how depraved I was
[1:03:19] and how helpless I was, Amen. It makes
[1:03:21] me want to do nothing but serve him and
[1:03:23] serve him and serve him and serve him.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You take you go back to Brother
[1:03:28] Benham's marriage example. You know, you
[1:03:29] get a you get a a girl who's got a a
[1:03:32] high estimation of herself and she
[1:03:34] thinks she's a beauty queen and she's
[1:03:35] all doalled up all the time and she's
[1:03:37] always flirting and trying to attract
[1:03:38] guys and she thinks she's God's gift to
[1:03:40] mankind and she dupes some poor soul,
[1:03:43] amen, into marrying her and she gets
[1:03:45] married and now she sees that husband as
[1:03:47] her servant to provide her with
[1:03:49] fineries, provide her with all the
[1:03:51] elegance that she needs because in her
[1:03:52] mind, amen, this man chose me because
[1:03:56] I'm so great and now she can never move
[1:03:58] into loving that man right and serving
[1:04:01] him like a wife should serve her husband
[1:04:02] because in her mind she's special
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; and she'll never be the right kind of
[1:04:08] wife because she'll never serve her
[1:04:10] husband. She wants her husband to serve
[1:04:12] her cuz she's special.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Well, guess what? When we go to marry
[1:04:16] Jesus Christ with the same mentality,
[1:04:18] amen, he chose me because I was the
[1:04:20] prettiest. He chose me because I was the
[1:04:21] best. He chose me because I could
[1:04:23] believe his because I had a mental
[1:04:25] capacity to accept his gospel. No, no,
[1:04:27] no, friends. That's not why he chose you
[1:04:30] by grace. Despite all of your failures,
[1:04:32] by grace. And when you know you're
[1:04:34] married to him, by unmarited favor, you
[1:04:36] were going the wrong way. You weren't
[1:04:38] worthy of his name.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. When a you take you take a
[1:04:47] different story in marriage. You take
[1:04:50] the washer woman who was chose by the
[1:04:52] boy uh the son of the man who owned the
[1:04:54] armor company.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:57] She was a poor girl stuck in poverty.
[1:05:00] She was now being mistreated by all her
[1:05:03] cousins because she was an orphan. Amen.
[1:05:06] She had no hope of ever rising above the
[1:05:08] position she was in. She was the chief
[1:05:10] servant amongst all servants. She didn't
[1:05:12] get the nicer dresses. She didn't have
[1:05:14] any money. She didn't have anything. She
[1:05:15] was living on the charity of family
[1:05:17] members and they were pushed her down to
[1:05:19] a place that was below them. And she had
[1:05:22] no hope of ever having a different life.
[1:05:24] That's the woman who washed Jesus's
[1:05:26] feet.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; No hope. She was trying. She was trying
[1:05:29] to climb out. And with all her effort,
[1:05:30] she could never escape it. Here, this
[1:05:32] woman, Amen. But she she was just
[1:05:34] serving. She was just accepted her life.
[1:05:37] Amen. She was washing the dishes and
[1:05:38] they were getting ready for the dances
[1:05:40] and they were going to do all that and
[1:05:41] and she was put out of all of it. She
[1:05:44] wasn't accepted with them and wasn't
[1:05:45] allowed to come.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; But this man who was a mighty man, who
[1:05:50] was a rich man. Amen. He come down and
[1:05:53] above everybody else, he chose her.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Not for her dress. I mean, not for her
[1:05:59] singing, not for her dancing, not for
[1:06:01] her talent show.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; He chose her because there was something
[1:06:05] in him he was attracted to and he just
[1:06:07] loved her really for no good outward
[1:06:10] reason.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; It wasn't her status in life and her
[1:06:14] ability. He just chose her because he
[1:06:16] loved her. Listen, you you know,
[1:06:19] humanity and you know how people are.
[1:06:21] Amen. I believe with all my heart that
[1:06:24] girl, Amen. in and in in gratitude for
[1:06:26] what God had done for her and what her
[1:06:28] husband had done for her, I guarantee
[1:06:30] she had no problem serving her husband.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to see myself. Amen.
[1:06:37] Listen, the the the the truth of
[1:06:38] predestinating election is an absolute
[1:06:41] truth and it always will be true. But
[1:06:43] don't you dare forget that it was the
[1:06:45] segene of God in your soul that was
[1:06:47] elected and predestinated chosen before
[1:06:48] the foundation of the world. Not. Amen.
[1:06:51] Your flesh.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; God knew it would come in this flesh.
[1:06:54] But that doesn't make your flesh being
[1:06:56] right.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Makes it wrong. Just as wrong as anybody
[1:07:01] else's is wrong, cuz you came the same
[1:07:03] way.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; We got to realize if it wasn't for what
[1:07:07] he did, I'm hopeless. Can't change my
[1:07:09] condition for forever be this way.
[1:07:13] But he chose. He knew before the
[1:07:16] foundation of the world. He came to me.
[1:07:18] He found me. He chose me. That's why
[1:07:22] these things are so important for us to
[1:07:24] remember.
[1:07:26] Because he who's forgiven much loveth
[1:07:29] much.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; I want to be one who loves much.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I don't want to treat Jesus
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; as though he was lucky to get me
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; and that I think he made a good choice.
[1:07:48] And now I want him to serve me.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; I want him to keep me in comfort. And I
[1:07:55] want him to provide everything I need.
[1:07:57] And I want him to serve me because I'm
[1:08:00] pretty sure he made a good choice and
[1:08:01] he's lucky to have me. Now, I don't
[1:08:03] think we're going to ever say that to
[1:08:05] anybody.
[1:08:06] But we don't want to take that attitude.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And I think it's I think it's possible
[1:08:15] should say it that way. I think we've
[1:08:17] seen it before
[1:08:19] where brother Ben says, "I I know my
[1:08:22] wife, you know, if I'll go out with this
[1:08:24] girl, my wife don't care. It's the wrong
[1:08:27] attitude.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Even though she would forgive him, he
[1:08:30] says his attitude's completely wrong. He
[1:08:32] don't he don't love that woman right.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; And if I know that I can do whatever I
[1:08:38] want and God will forgive me for it and
[1:08:40] he loves me anyways, I don't love God,
[1:08:43] right?
[1:08:47] maybe I don't really understand grace.
[1:08:50] And that's what I think happens
[1:08:52] sometimes is we don't really comprehend
[1:08:55] grace because if we really comprehended
[1:08:58] grace, I think we would realize he is my
[1:09:02] all in all
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; and he is my only hope and chance and I
[1:09:07] owe him everything.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; I owe him everything. Not in a way that
[1:09:14] I begrudgingly have to pay back a debt,
[1:09:16] but I owe him everything because I have
[1:09:20] nothing without him. And now I want to
[1:09:23] give him everything.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; This is what the Apostle Paul says in 1
[1:09:27] Corinthians 15. And last of all, he was
[1:09:30] seen of me also as one born out of due
[1:09:33] time. For I am the least of the apostles
[1:09:35] that I'm not me to be called an apostle
[1:09:37] because I persecuted the church of God.
[1:09:40] But by the grace of God, I am what I am.
[1:09:42] And his grace which was bestowed upon me
[1:09:44] was not in vain. But I labored more
[1:09:47] abundantly than they all. Yet not I, but
[1:09:49] the grace of God which was with me. The
[1:09:51] Apostle Paul now recognizes, hey,
[1:09:53] listen. I was not worthy. I'm the least
[1:09:56] of the apostles and not worthy because
[1:09:58] of my deeds.
[1:10:00] He knows because he we we know about the
[1:10:02] conversion of Paul going absolutely the
[1:10:05] wrong way 100% contrary to the word of
[1:10:08] God and fighting the very thing he
[1:10:10] claimed to love. He was in a bad place.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; And he knew that he was least of the
[1:10:16] apostles and not worthy not meat to be
[1:10:18] called an apostle because of his deeds.
[1:10:21] But he knew by the grace of God he was
[1:10:23] what he was. And now he says I love I
[1:10:26] love the way he says this. But by the
[1:10:28] grace of God, I am what I am. And his
[1:10:30] grace which was bestowed upon me was not
[1:10:32] in vain, but I labored more abundantly
[1:10:35] than they all.
[1:10:37] He's saying, listen, because I
[1:10:39] understand where I came from and I
[1:10:41] wasn't worthy and I'm I shouldn't even
[1:10:43] be here right now, I gave all myself to
[1:10:45] the work he called me to. And then he
[1:10:48] checks himself
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Yet not I, but the grace
[1:10:53] of God which was with me."
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "I didn't even do that by
[1:10:56] myself. Even me giving myself to him
[1:10:59] completely. Amen. Because of my
[1:11:00] gratitude for him, because of my
[1:11:02] unworthiness. And then then I I gave
[1:11:04] myself more to the labor than them all.
[1:11:06] But he but he checks himself. But not I.
[1:11:08] It was the grace of God that was with
[1:11:09] me. I can't even do that by myself.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. What do I want to give God? My
[1:11:16] absolute devotion and love. I want to
[1:11:17] give him first place preeminence on all
[1:11:19] my life as my gratitude for his
[1:11:21] salvation. As my recognition of what
[1:11:23] grace has done for me. Even that I can't
[1:11:26] do without his grace.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; I can't even get that right unless he
[1:11:31] helps me.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; So is my desire, but it's still his
[1:11:36] grace.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Paul makes this statement of himself and
[1:11:43] and Filament or Phileman
[1:11:46] says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:49] Brother will pick up on this statement
[1:11:51] because brother Paul uses it in
[1:11:52] different places. He uses it again in
[1:11:54] Filament later, but he picks up on that
[1:11:57] statement and shows how Paul called
[1:12:00] himself a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:04] And then he begins to expound on it and
[1:12:05] he says, "Why? He was a predestinated
[1:12:08] seed. God said, I have chose him." Yeah.
[1:12:10] And I'm going to show him what great
[1:12:12] things he'll suffer for my name's sake.
[1:12:15] I'll send him to the Gentiles and
[1:12:17] disgrace him in every way that they can
[1:12:19] be disgraced, but yet he'll bear my
[1:12:21] name. Paul went down then till he got
[1:12:24] all of his ecclesiastical stuff cut off
[1:12:26] of him down at the backside of the
[1:12:28] desert for three years and a half down
[1:12:31] there in Arabia until he learned the
[1:12:32] word and the word became he and he
[1:12:35] became a prisoner. He came back in
[1:12:38] chains of love.
[1:12:40] All my seminary experiences gone. I'm a
[1:12:42] prisoner to Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:12:45] Phileman, my brother, I'm a prisoner of
[1:12:46] Jesus Christ. I only can speak and say
[1:12:49] what he tells me. God needs prisoners
[1:12:52] today that will prison yourself to his
[1:12:54] will, to his word.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, we can take what brother
[1:12:58] Bram says here in the last line. God
[1:13:00] needs prison. You say, "Yep, that's what
[1:13:01] God needs today." Amen. I'm going to
[1:13:03] become one of them because that's what
[1:13:05] God needs today. But the way it was done
[1:13:08] was by chains of love. Not chains not
[1:13:11] not chains of turning over a new leave,
[1:13:14] not chains of forcing yourself into
[1:13:16] something. It was actually a response of
[1:13:18] love.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He bound himself by chains of
[1:13:21] love. Which means Paul was free to do
[1:13:24] anything Paul wanted to do
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; because the bond that the chains that
[1:13:30] bound him to Jesus Christ were not
[1:13:32] chains that Jesus Christ put on Paul,
[1:13:35] but they were chains that Paul put on
[1:13:38] Paul to by love attach himself to Jesus
[1:13:41] Christ and be bound to Christ and to be
[1:13:43] a prisoner of Jesus Christ. And so now
[1:13:46] his whole life was subject to Jesus
[1:13:48] Christ by what? By works. No. Did he do
[1:13:51] works? Yes. But what was the motivation
[1:13:54] behind it? Love.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; It was this reciprocating love. He knew
[1:13:58] what he was and he knew where he was
[1:14:00] going and he knew what would have
[1:14:01] happened if he hadn't met the pillar of
[1:14:03] fire. Amen. And that he could not have
[1:14:05] made happen. That was the grace of God
[1:14:07] coming into his life. And he knew what
[1:14:09] he would be without that event.
[1:14:16] And so now he could bind himself by
[1:14:18] chains of love.
[1:14:20] It wasn't a begrudging thing. It wasn't
[1:14:23] a I have to do this and if I don't do
[1:14:26] this I won't. It was nothing like that
[1:14:28] for the Apostle Paul. And there was
[1:14:29] hardship involved. There was difficulty.
[1:14:32] There was self-denial.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; There was suffering. All of that. But
[1:14:37] Paul willingly went through all of that
[1:14:40] because of his gratitude for the grace
[1:14:42] of God.
[1:14:44] Amen. Nobody slapped chains on his
[1:14:46] wrist. He handcuffed himself to Christ.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; The jail cell was open. He went in.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And he closed the door behind him.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Because that's what he he wanted to
[1:14:58] serve God.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And even that he couldn't do without the
[1:15:03] grace of God in his life.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love it. Let's turn to uh
[1:15:08] Philippians 3 together.
[1:15:13] Philippians chapter 3.
[1:15:27] Philippians 3 and4
[1:15:31] says, "Though I might also have
[1:15:33] confidence in the flesh, if if any other
[1:15:36] man thinkketh that he hath whereof he
[1:15:38] might trust in the flesh, I more
[1:15:41] circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[1:15:43] of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a
[1:15:45] Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the
[1:15:47] law, a Pharisee, concerning zeal,
[1:15:49] persecuting the church, church, touching
[1:15:51] the righteousness which is in the law,
[1:15:53] blameless.
[1:15:54] But what things were gained to me? Those
[1:15:56] I counted loss for Christ. Yay,
[1:15:59] doubtless. And I count all things but
[1:16:01] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[1:16:02] of Christ Jesus my Lord. for whom I have
[1:16:05] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:16:07] count them but dung that I may win
[1:16:09] Christ and be found in him not having my
[1:16:13] own righteousness which is of the law
[1:16:15] but that which is through the faith of
[1:16:17] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[1:16:20] by faith that I may know him and the
[1:16:23] power of his resurrection and the
[1:16:25] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:16:27] conformable unto his death if by any
[1:16:29] means I might attain to the resurrection
[1:16:32] of the And Paul was so willing to give
[1:16:36] up everything.
[1:16:38] Not because somebody stood up to next to
[1:16:40] him and says, "You've got to get rid of
[1:16:41] this and you got to get rid of that and
[1:16:42] you got to get rid of this and you got
[1:16:43] to get rid of that." But he says, "I
[1:16:45] count it all loss
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; that I might win Christ. My reputation
[1:16:51] and my position and everything that I
[1:16:53] forego and everything that I let go and
[1:16:55] everything that I turn my back on, I
[1:16:58] count it but dumb.
[1:17:00] and don't want it anymore. I only want
[1:17:02] one thing. I want to apprehend this
[1:17:05] thing I've been apprehended by. I want
[1:17:08] to press towards a mark of the high
[1:17:09] calling in Christ. I want more of him.
[1:17:11] Amen. I want to give my life to him. I
[1:17:13] want to share my life with him. I want
[1:17:15] to do all I can for him because it was
[1:17:18] love.
[1:17:20] That to me is so important. That's the
[1:17:23] way I want to serve him. Friends, that's
[1:17:26] the desire of my heart.
[1:17:30] Abraham says he only reveals his word in
[1:17:33] the predestinated.
[1:17:35] Now when I use the word predestinate now
[1:17:36] it's a bad word to use public especially
[1:17:39] when we have mixed crowds between
[1:17:40] Armenians and Calvinist and I've asked
[1:17:43] you not to think I not to think I know
[1:17:46] it all but they're both wrong according
[1:17:47] to the scripture. Grace is what God did
[1:17:50] for me. Works is what I do for him.
[1:17:54] And the book of Titus 3:3 says, "For we
[1:17:57] ourselves, for we ourselves also were
[1:18:00] sometimes foolish, disobedient,
[1:18:03] deceiving, serving, diverse lust and
[1:18:05] pleasures, living in malice and envy,
[1:18:08] hateful, and hating one another. But
[1:18:10] after that, the kindness of love of God
[1:18:12] our Savior toward men appeared, not by
[1:18:14] works of righteousness, which we have
[1:18:16] done, but according to his mercy, he
[1:18:18] saved us by the washing of regeneration
[1:18:20] and the renewing of the Holy Ghost,
[1:18:22] which he shed on us abundantly through
[1:18:24] Jesus Christ our savior. That being
[1:18:27] justified by his grace, we should be
[1:18:29] made hes according to the hope of
[1:18:31] eternal life. This is a faithful saying,
[1:18:34] and these things I will, that thou
[1:18:36] affirm constantly, that they which have
[1:18:39] believed in God might be careful to
[1:18:41] maintain good works. These things are
[1:18:44] good and profitable unto men. Remember,
[1:18:48] Paul is teaching that your works has
[1:18:51] nothing to do with your salvation.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; We're on the same page. All right?
[1:18:55] Paul's not changing his mind to Timothy.
[1:18:58] Amen. But Paul clearly understands,
[1:19:00] Amen. where he stands. We are justified
[1:19:03] by his grace. He's sitting there telling
[1:19:04] Timothy once again that that we have
[1:19:07] been saved. We ourselves were in
[1:19:09] foolishness and disobed we were all of
[1:19:11] this. Amen. But after the kindness and
[1:19:13] love of God, our savior, amen, to man
[1:19:15] appeared not of works of righteousness,
[1:19:17] not by anything we have done, but
[1:19:20] according to his mercy, he saved us. So
[1:19:22] he's telling Titus, your works has
[1:19:24] nothing to do with your salvation. Your
[1:19:26] works has nothing to do with God's love
[1:19:27] for you. God's love for you is secure
[1:19:29] from before the foundation of the world
[1:19:31] and will not change.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; So, he's establishing this first.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; But being justified by his grace, we
[1:19:39] should be hes according to the hope of
[1:19:41] eternal life. You've already got eternal
[1:19:44] life. He said, "This is a faithful
[1:19:46] saying, and these things I will that
[1:19:47] thou affirm constantly that they which
[1:19:50] have believed in God might be careful to
[1:19:52] maintain good works. These things are
[1:19:55] good and profitable unto men."
[1:19:57] It's like,
[1:20:01] so do I have to do it or do I not have
[1:20:03] to do it?
[1:20:05] I don't have to do works for salvation
[1:20:08] or to earn God's love. I don't have to
[1:20:10] do it to be part of his grace. I don't
[1:20:11] have to do it to have his grace bestowed
[1:20:12] upon me. But this is a good thing.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; This is your love for God. This is what
[1:20:18] the believers should be doing.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; That's what's Paul saying. Be careful to
[1:20:23] maintain good works. Amen. There's so
[1:20:25] many churches today. Amen. They've moved
[1:20:28] over to grace to make grace disgrace
[1:20:30] where the grace of God puts no
[1:20:32] requirements on me. And because I have
[1:20:34] no requirements, I just go live exactly
[1:20:36] like the world lives. Like Leodysia,
[1:20:38] dress, act, talk, listen to, do
[1:20:40] everything else they do. And I'm banking
[1:20:42] on the grace of God. Amen. For
[1:20:43] everything. Because it's not by works.
[1:20:45] Amen. And brother Bam's going to show us
[1:20:46] in a minute. He says, "You're not even
[1:20:48] saved yet if you can live like that.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; You haven't even come to a revelation of
[1:20:53] what grace is. If you can live like
[1:20:55] that, you haven't even come to a
[1:20:57] revelation of what grace is.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm not the only one who says that.
[1:21:00] So, so just bear with me.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; He says in questions and answers, I'm
[1:21:06] your father in the gospel. As Paul said
[1:21:08] there, this is brother Brenam now
[1:21:09] talking to the church. I've begotten you
[1:21:11] to Christ and now I espouse you to
[1:21:13] Christ. That's engaged you to Christ as
[1:21:14] a chase virgin. Don't let me down. Don't
[1:21:17] let me down. You stay a chase virgin.
[1:21:20] How will I do it, brother Ben? Stay
[1:21:22] right with the word. live clean and
[1:21:24] pure, have nothing to do with the things
[1:21:26] of the world. If the love of it's in
[1:21:27] your heart, say, "Oh, Jesus, please take
[1:21:29] that away from me. I don't want to be
[1:21:31] like that. I don't mean just to to be
[1:21:34] some person that's saying this." I mean
[1:21:36] to be a genuine believer. Believe Jesus
[1:21:39] Christ and live for him every day. Don't
[1:21:42] do no evil. Now, a lot of times I speak
[1:21:44] of Calvinistic belief. Now, don't think
[1:21:46] that lets you loose to do anything you
[1:21:48] want to do.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; No. Because God is still God. He's still
[1:21:52] our father. Christ is still our husband.
[1:21:54] He still has instructions for us. And
[1:21:56] his instructions for us should be I mean
[1:21:59] it should be a delight for us to know
[1:22:00] what he wants.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be a delight. Sometimes
[1:22:04] I'm amazed at how much my wife loves
[1:22:07] serving her family and what she'll go
[1:22:08] through and what she'll do to serve us.
[1:22:11] Amen. She'll she'll stay up late. She'll
[1:22:12] get up early. And sometimes I'm
[1:22:14] overwhelmed. Amen. Because I don't put
[1:22:17] those requirements on her. Nobody's
[1:22:18] demanding that she does that. In fact,
[1:22:20] there's things that around the house I
[1:22:22] would do myself. I don't mind doing
[1:22:23] them, but she doesn't want me to do
[1:22:25] them. She wants to do them for me.
[1:22:28] And sometimes I'm blown away about how
[1:22:31] much she wants to do for me. And it
[1:22:33] takes me back a little bit because her
[1:22:35] love is a sacrificial love, but she
[1:22:37] wants to do it not to earn anything for
[1:22:39] me because she doesn't need to earn
[1:22:41] anything from me.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; She does it purely based off love.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it takes my breath away.
[1:22:49] And when I see that kind of love and an
[1:22:51] earthly relationship, all of a sudden, I
[1:22:54] realize what what it is that my heart
[1:22:56] longs for to give back to Christ. I want
[1:22:58] to go the extra mile. I want to do the
[1:23:00] extra deed. I don't want to just check
[1:23:01] off the list of things I have to do. I
[1:23:03] want to do whatever can be pleasing to
[1:23:05] him.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I want to do I don't want Listen, I I
[1:23:10] don't want somebody to give me the
[1:23:11] checklist. If you do this, this, and
[1:23:12] this, and this, you're a believer and
[1:23:14] you've pleased God. Listen, I I don't
[1:23:16] want to just check check. Now, I'm done.
[1:23:18] Now I can go on and do what I want the
[1:23:19] rest of the day. I fulfilled my
[1:23:21] obligations as a believer. I don't want
[1:23:23] to live like that. Amen. I want to live
[1:23:25] every minute. Is this pleasing to him?
[1:23:27] Is this pleasing to him? Is this
[1:23:28] pleasing to him? Not a rulebook, but a
[1:23:31] desire to please him in every situation
[1:23:33] because you can live a rulebook and be
[1:23:35] displeasing in your attitude and your
[1:23:38] actions
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; because you're going to face situations
[1:23:41] that aren't spelled out. You're going to
[1:23:42] face situations that you don't have a
[1:23:44] quote for. You're going to come into
[1:23:45] circumstances that it's just going to be
[1:23:47] your desire to please him that'll help
[1:23:49] you navigate that situation.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Too many times we dive into the message
[1:23:55] and we try to find out, you know, I have
[1:23:57] this desire to do this. Now, I want to
[1:24:00] find out if it's acceptable in the
[1:24:01] message to do this. So, I don't see
[1:24:03] brother Bam say anything about this. So,
[1:24:05] I'm going to do this. And it's all based
[1:24:08] on a selfish desire to do something, not
[1:24:10] based on the desire to be pleasing to
[1:24:12] God. All right.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And if you go to the message looking
[1:24:16] that way, you're going to find the
[1:24:18] loophole that you're looking for.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I guarantee it. You look long enough,
[1:24:23] you'll find the loophole you're looking
[1:24:24] for. I don't want a loophole.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; I just want to know what's pleasing to
[1:24:29] him.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I just want to be sensitive to his
[1:24:32] spirit. I want to listen to the voice of
[1:24:34] God, right? And he explains to us what
[1:24:36] God likes, what God doesn't like, and
[1:24:37] the character of God. And I want that to
[1:24:39] become a reality to me to where every
[1:24:42] situation I face, I'm not looking at
[1:24:44] what do I want versus what I'm allowed
[1:24:46] to do. I'm looking at what do I want
[1:24:48] versus what he wants.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; That's the way I want to live my faith.
[1:24:58] That's the desire of my heart. And I
[1:25:00] failed in it thousands of times. I'll
[1:25:02] probably fail in it again. But in my
[1:25:04] soul, that's what I'm longing to be to
[1:25:05] him. I'm longing to be chained by chains
[1:25:08] of love. Not a have to on anything, but
[1:25:10] a great desire to be pleasing to him.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; I believe that's the desire of the bride
[1:25:14] in the end times. She's going to be a
[1:25:16] genuine true bride of Jesus Christ. And
[1:25:18] he was a true son of God because he only
[1:25:21] did that which pleased the father.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; So, how am I going to be a true genuine
[1:25:25] bride of Jesus Christ when I only do
[1:25:27] that which pleases my husband?
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; That's the life I want to live.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And so, it's it's not simple. It's not
[1:25:35] simple. Do all this and don't do all
[1:25:37] that. It's more than that. It's a desire
[1:25:41] of the heart, a reflection of the heart.
[1:25:45] And the message of grace, the prophet
[1:25:46] says, "We are saved by grace and that
[1:25:48] through faith, not by works." Works
[1:25:51] shows that you have been saved.
[1:25:54] You catch that statement?
[1:25:56] Works shows that you have been saved.
[1:25:59] But what saves you is the grace of God.
[1:26:01] Grace saves you. Grace is what God does
[1:26:03] for you. works is what you do for God to
[1:26:05] show appreciation of what God did for
[1:26:08] you. But but by grace are you saved.
[1:26:11] Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore,
[1:26:14] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[1:26:16] you present your bodies a living
[1:26:17] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[1:26:20] which is your reasonable service, not
[1:26:23] even above and beyond.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Just can presenting your bodies as a
[1:26:28] living sacrifice.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; That means completely dying to self all
[1:26:32] the time. selfish desires, selfish
[1:26:34] wants. Amen. And live holy, that means
[1:26:36] separated, consecrated, and acceptable
[1:26:39] to God, which is your reasonable
[1:26:41] service.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; And be not conformed to this world, but
[1:26:45] be you transformed by the renewing of
[1:26:46] your mind, that you may prove what is
[1:26:48] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:26:50] will of God. For I say through the grace
[1:26:52] given unto me to every man that is among
[1:26:54] you, not to think of himself more highly
[1:26:57] than he ought to think, but to think
[1:26:58] soberly according as God hath dealt to
[1:27:01] every man the measure of faith.
[1:27:04] I love this. I'm going to read this th
[1:27:08] this verse three again because I don't
[1:27:10] want to go so fast we miss it. For I say
[1:27:13] through the grace given unto me to every
[1:27:16] man that is among you not to think of
[1:27:18] himself more highly than he ought to.
[1:27:22] but to think soberly
[1:27:26] according as God had dealt to every man
[1:27:28] the measure of faith.
[1:27:30] We don't think I'm this and I'm this and
[1:27:34] let's be sober minded. Let's not, you
[1:27:37] know, be too far gone in our mind. Let's
[1:27:39] come back to sobriety.
[1:27:42] I'm only this because God has dealt to
[1:27:44] me a measure of faith.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; That that's to be sober minded. Don't
[1:27:48] think more of let's not think more of
[1:27:50] ourselves than we ought to. I'm special
[1:27:52] and I'm like that's that is true. But
[1:27:55] that's only true by the grace of God.
[1:27:56] That's not true by anything I've done.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Not one thing I've done puts me in the
[1:28:01] position he put me in before the
[1:28:03] foundation of the world. He did it
[1:28:04] independent of my actions.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; So when we're going to offer our lives
[1:28:10] as a reasonable service to him, we
[1:28:13] recognize that offering my life is just
[1:28:15] a reasonable service. It doesn't put me
[1:28:16] in a better position.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I'm here by the grace of God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He's dealt to me the measure of faith.
[1:28:23] So, I ought not to think of myself more
[1:28:25] highly. I not I don't want to go back to
[1:28:29] being the wife that thinks he's lucky to
[1:28:31] have me for a wife.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; I want to be sober minded and realize he
[1:28:36] just chose me. He could have chose
[1:28:38] somebody else, but he chose me.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; And here you him. It says, "When you
[1:28:43] really love God, my brother, you don't
[1:28:45] want to get by with nothing.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Please God, let that be my heart."
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; When you really love God, my brother,
[1:28:54] you don't want to get by with nothing.
[1:28:55] You love him. And you serve him because
[1:28:58] that you love him because that he loves
[1:29:00] you.
[1:29:02] Period.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; End of story. Not because I have to do
[1:29:06] anything to earn his love or anything to
[1:29:08] climb to a better position, but simply
[1:29:11] because I love him. And I love him
[1:29:12] because he loved me. We love him because
[1:29:15] he first loved us.
[1:29:18] In the message, you must be born again.
[1:29:20] He says, "So not trying to squeeze in a
[1:29:24] Calvinistic belief." Now, you see, I'm
[1:29:26] not in saying this now that I'm talking
[1:29:29] to a legalist people. That's not it at
[1:29:31] all because I'm a legalist, too. So,
[1:29:33] Brother Brandon preaches grace and
[1:29:35] Calvinism all the time, but he calls
[1:29:37] himself a legalist. I love it. But I
[1:29:41] believe this that Calvin had something
[1:29:42] and so did Armenian have something and
[1:29:45] they both had something but they run off
[1:29:47] the deep ends of it. The Calvinist says,
[1:29:49] "Well, I'm saved and just that settles
[1:29:52] it." His life proves that he isn't. When
[1:29:55] he isn't saved and the legalist says,
[1:29:57] "I've got to do this and I must do this
[1:29:59] and I must do that." Then if you're not
[1:30:01] born again, you're still not saved.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; So there you are. It's between in the
[1:30:07] middle of the road is where we've got to
[1:30:08] stay.
[1:30:10] What are you? What Calvinism is, what
[1:30:13] grace is, is what God did for you. What
[1:30:15] works is is what you do for God in
[1:30:17] appreciation of what he did for you
[1:30:19] through grace. That's the whole answer.
[1:30:21] Then if I'm saved, then I live like I'm
[1:30:23] saved. But I couldn't live like I but I
[1:30:26] could live like I was saved and not be
[1:30:28] saved. See, so it's the fact then that
[1:30:32] brings it to the spot that we must be
[1:30:34] born again. So the born again experience
[1:30:36] tells us what we are. It doesn't mean I
[1:30:39] believe in shouting and all the
[1:30:40] manifestations and demonstrations of the
[1:30:42] spirit, but yet that's not it. See, it's
[1:30:44] something different from that. It's a
[1:30:46] new creature, something in the heart.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; It's not that I do all these works or I
[1:30:53] have to do all of this or or I'm just
[1:30:55] saved and I can do anything I want. It's
[1:30:57] none of that. It comes down to a
[1:30:58] born-again experience where the
[1:31:00] revelation strikes you and you realize
[1:31:02] who you are and what God did for you and
[1:31:04] what you are without him. And then
[1:31:06] there's a love response that comes from
[1:31:07] the soul.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; It's the born again experience. And then
[1:31:11] the new life, new nature doesn't want
[1:31:13] the world. Doesn't want the selfish
[1:31:15] desires of the past. Doesn't want the
[1:31:17] lust of the flesh. It wants to please
[1:31:19] the Lord. That's the born again
[1:31:22] experience.
[1:31:24] He says in 1 John 4:19
[1:31:28] says we love him because he first loved
[1:31:31] us.
[1:31:32] If a man say, "I love God," and hateth
[1:31:34] his brother, he is a liar. For he that
[1:31:36] loveth not his brother whom he hath
[1:31:38] seen, how can he love God who he has not
[1:31:40] seen? And this commandment have we from
[1:31:42] him that he who loveth God loveth his
[1:31:45] brother also. If I could, I just want to
[1:31:48] take a minute and I want to share
[1:31:50] another thought with you if that's okay.
[1:31:52] I want to tie it in with this, but just
[1:31:54] another side thought.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we talk about the response to
[1:31:57] grace, I've been talking about love and
[1:31:58] I've been talking about the response of
[1:32:00] love and giving our lives out of love.
[1:32:03] But there's another response to grace
[1:32:05] that I see. This is just me. But my
[1:32:09] response to God's grace for me dictates
[1:32:11] how I treat everybody else.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Because if I realize what God did for me
[1:32:17] and what I am without him,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; it makes it impossible for me to go
[1:32:21] around condemning everybody else.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; It changes my approach. It changes my
[1:32:26] mentality. It changes everything because
[1:32:28] but by the grace of God, there go we
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Where would I be without him? I mean,
[1:32:33] where we we would be just like Paul.
[1:32:36] Where would I be? I mean, where would
[1:32:38] Paul be if God had not come to him in a
[1:32:41] pillar of fire? Where would I be if God
[1:32:44] had not come and brought the true
[1:32:45] revelation around and woke me up to the
[1:32:47] real? If God's grace had not come to me
[1:32:49] to bring me to the word, where would I
[1:32:51] be? Yeah.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; And if God can do that for me, and if I
[1:32:56] could just remember what I was before,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; there's no way that I could look down my
[1:33:01] nose at humanity and condemn everybody
[1:33:03] else walking around. Amen. If God can
[1:33:05] have grace on me, God can have grace on
[1:33:07] them. They can be a recipient of grace,
[1:33:09] too. Amen. So, it changes my dealings
[1:33:11] with humanity.
[1:33:13] This to me is is a response to grace
[1:33:16] also.
[1:33:19] Amen.
[1:33:24] In Luke, he says, Luke 17:3, "Take heed
[1:33:27] to yourselves. If thy brother trespass
[1:33:30] against thee, rebuke him. And if he
[1:33:33] repent, forgive him. And if he trespass
[1:33:35] against thee seven times in a day, and
[1:33:37] seven times in a day turn again to thee,
[1:33:40] saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive
[1:33:42] him."
[1:33:44] I love this
[1:33:46] because
[1:33:48] how many times have I repented to God?
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; How many times have I failed him in one
[1:33:57] day?
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; How many times in one day have I told
[1:34:02] him I'm sorry?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And if God will forgive me and have
[1:34:07] grace on me, then what right do I have
[1:34:10] to not extend grace for a brother?
[1:34:14] I have no right to treat somebody else
[1:34:16] with no grace because I've been God's
[1:34:18] bestowed so much grace upon me
[1:34:20] continually.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Continually. Listen, I don't want God to
[1:34:26] treat me the way I've treated other
[1:34:27] people. I want God to treat me according
[1:34:29] to this word.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And I want him to give a grace in my
[1:34:32] life to help me treat others the way
[1:34:34] he's treated me.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; So that I can be an extension of his
[1:34:38] life to others.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if my brother offend me, how
[1:34:42] many times? 70 times seven in a day. But
[1:34:45] yet he turned and repent, forgive him.
[1:34:48] Amen. And don't ask him to pay a price.
[1:34:50] Don't ask him to I mean, we don't put
[1:34:52] him in in in in lockdown and put him in
[1:34:55] prison and make him serve so much and
[1:34:57] then pay back. No, remember the brother
[1:34:59] Brandham told the uh uh not Jesus Christ
[1:35:01] told the parable and the parable he said
[1:35:04] those all uh there was a debtor and they
[1:35:06] all had debts and they owed to the to
[1:35:08] the Lord and and the Lord uh forgave a
[1:35:10] man of his debt. He kneel down before
[1:35:12] him. He said please forgive me. I got
[1:35:13] women and children. I can't pay the
[1:35:14] debt. Forgive me my debt. And he says he
[1:35:17] forgave him. That forgiveness was an act
[1:35:20] of grace
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; because his Lord had every right to
[1:35:24] persecute him, every right to sell him
[1:35:26] into slavery. every right. I mean, he he
[1:35:28] this man did nothing to get forgiveness,
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; nothing to have his debts abolished. He
[1:35:34] couldn't have earned it. He couldn't pay
[1:35:36] for it. He couldn't pay it back. He had
[1:35:38] nothing to to He had nothing to help
[1:35:41] himself in this situation. So, the Lord
[1:35:43] said, "I forgive you of your debt." And
[1:35:45] forgave him of it all.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And this man runs out and it was a huge
[1:35:51] sum of money. This man runs out and he
[1:35:53] finds a friend who owes him a tiny
[1:35:55] amount of money. And that tiny amount of
[1:35:57] money, he takes him by the throat and he
[1:35:59] threatens to take him into the
[1:36:00] magistrate to have him locked up until
[1:36:02] every penny was paid. And the servants
[1:36:04] of the master went back and told him
[1:36:06] what this this unruly servant did. And
[1:36:09] he called him up and he said, "I freely
[1:36:10] forgave you of all this and you wouldn't
[1:36:12] forgive a friend of this small debt."
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Grace has been bestowed upon us.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; It should be nothing for us to bestow
[1:36:25] grace on Amen.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Everyone else,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; not just each other in the church. Of
[1:36:30] course, it should be our brothers and
[1:36:31] sisters, but it should go beyond our
[1:36:32] brothers and sisters.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't know who's who. And I don't
[1:36:37] know who's in God's economy, but I know
[1:36:39] I receive grace. Anybody else can.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; God can save me. He can save anybody. He
[1:36:44] can save the vilest. He can save the
[1:36:45] most unruly. He can save the filthiest
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; and make them white as snow. So it
[1:36:52] should change my response to grace, my
[1:36:54] understanding of grace, my re revelation
[1:36:57] of grace should change the way I view my
[1:37:00] brothers and sisters and view the world.
[1:37:02] In Ephesians 4:32 says, "And be ye kind
[1:37:05] one to another, tenderhearted,
[1:37:07] forgiving one another, even as God for
[1:37:10] Christ's sake hath forgiven you."
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; This is how he tells us to act. This is
[1:37:15] how he tells us we should respond to his
[1:37:18] forgiveness by forgiving one another.
[1:37:23] In 1 Corinthians 6:9, he says, "Now know
[1:37:26] you not that the unrighteous shall not
[1:37:28] inherit the kingdom of God. Be not
[1:37:30] deceived, neither fornicators, nor
[1:37:33] idolattors, nor adulterers, nor
[1:37:35] effeminate, nor abusers of themselves
[1:37:37] with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous,
[1:37:39] nor drunkers, nori revilers, nor
[1:37:41] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:37:43] of God." And such were some of you.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Let us never forget that
[1:37:49] truth.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; And such were some of you, but ye are
[1:37:55] washed. But you are sanctified. But you
[1:37:57] are justified in the name of the Lord
[1:37:59] Jesus and by the spirit of our God.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a reminder he lays down.
[1:38:04] Listen, don't don't be deceived. None of
[1:38:06] these people are going to inherit the
[1:38:08] kingdom of God. But that doesn't mean we
[1:38:09] go out in the world and write it. You're
[1:38:11] out. You're out. You're out. You're out.
[1:38:12] because he makes this this statement
[1:38:14] clause that will stop us from that
[1:38:16] attitude. He says, "But such were some
[1:38:18] of you."
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; And don't forget it.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; But you are washed. You're sanctified.
[1:38:28] If God could capture me and pull me out
[1:38:32] of that life, he can pull anybody out.
[1:38:39] In the great commission, he says,
[1:38:42] "Though he's absolutely wrong, before
[1:38:46] you leave the throne of God, you'll be
[1:38:47] feeling sorry for that man." Brother
[1:38:49] Bam's telling us, if somebody's done you
[1:38:51] wrong and really done you wrong and you
[1:38:53] don't know why they've done it, you just
[1:38:55] take them to the throne of God and you
[1:38:57] stand there with them
[1:38:58] shouldertoshoulder.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And listen to what he says. He says,
[1:39:03] "Before you leave the throne of God,
[1:39:04] you'll be feeling sorry for that man.
[1:39:06] You'll be sympathizing with that
[1:39:07] brother. And when you get back down here
[1:39:09] where earth again, you'll go over to
[1:39:12] that brother and shake his hand because
[1:39:14] you know what he's been through. You
[1:39:16] can't stand with a mortal in the
[1:39:18] presence of God and condemn anybody.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; I don't believe. No sir. Even if he's a
[1:39:23] rank sinner.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; And what about a brother that has made a
[1:39:27] mistake? Though I say he's wrong,
[1:39:29] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:39:31] not wrong. But if he is wrong, well, if
[1:39:34] we will take him to the throne of God,
[1:39:35] standing there shoulder-to-shoulder with
[1:39:37] our brother, knowing he's immortal, and
[1:39:39] maybe his destination rest upon our
[1:39:42] attitude towards him. When we come back
[1:39:45] from the throne of God, we'll realize
[1:39:47] that we're everyone guilty and we all
[1:39:50] need help one from the other.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; I believe the revelation of grace
[1:39:56] changes our approach to people.
[1:40:00] changes the way we approach. It doesn't
[1:40:04] mean there's no correction.
[1:40:07] Paul, listen, Paul was the one who
[1:40:09] taught grace. Brother say Paul was the
[1:40:12] apostle, the prophet who separated law
[1:40:14] from grace and established the church
[1:40:16] under the grace covenant of Abraham.
[1:40:18] Amen. And set it up that way without
[1:40:20] works. It was Paul who did that. But it
[1:40:22] was Paul who taught the church how to
[1:40:24] administer church discipline to somebody
[1:40:26] who wasn't living the word.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't mean there's no
[1:40:29] correction. It doesn't mean there's no
[1:40:31] calling out out against sin. It doesn't
[1:40:33] mean that there's not things that are
[1:40:34] still wrong and things God wants us to
[1:40:36] do. It has nothing to do with that.
[1:40:38] Amen. It has to do with the fact that we
[1:40:41] we we by love want to serve God. And if
[1:40:44] we make a mistake, God has not kicked us
[1:40:46] out of grace. He's not taking our name
[1:40:48] off the book. God still loves us. Amen.
[1:40:50] And he's going to bring us back into
[1:40:51] fellowship with him. And if he does that
[1:40:53] for me over and over and over again,
[1:40:55] he'll do it for my brother.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Remember Paul? Remember the Apostle
[1:41:00] Paul, he's telling a story to the
[1:41:02] Corinthian, a story, he's giving
[1:41:04] instruction to the Corinthian church
[1:41:05] that there's a man there that's
[1:41:06] committed a sin that's not even
[1:41:08] mentioned among the Gentiles that he
[1:41:10] would have his father's wife.
[1:41:12] And Paul says, "Listen, that's wrong.
[1:41:15] And you guys not dealing with it, that
[1:41:17] means you're puffed up, you're proud,
[1:41:19] and you think you can just bear with
[1:41:20] it." He says, "Listen, when you're
[1:41:22] gathered together in my spirit with you,
[1:41:23] commit such a one to Satan for the
[1:41:25] destruction of flesh."
[1:41:27] He's telling them church discipline.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; And he expects them to administer it.
[1:41:33] But then we come later in Corinthians
[1:41:35] and we find out that this man repented
[1:41:37] with sorrow. He made it right. And there
[1:41:39] was some who were keeping him at arms
[1:41:41] length. And Paul comes back to the one
[1:41:43] who told them to put him out. Now he
[1:41:45] rebukes them for not taking him back in.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; I love the word of God. Amen. There's
[1:41:53] nothing that my brother can do that that
[1:41:56] God cannot reconcile. God cannot bring
[1:41:58] him in because God's forgiven me of all
[1:42:00] kinds of stuff.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; And listen, most of the thing God
[1:42:04] forgives us for, nobody else knows.
[1:42:09] If we had a list,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; if we had a list of everything God has
[1:42:16] forgiven you for
[1:42:18] and we could pass it out before church
[1:42:23] on a day we had to make a judgment,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; I think we'd be a little softer in our
[1:42:29] approach.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I think we'd be more retrospect. I don't
[1:42:34] think we would be riding on our high
[1:42:36] horse end to condemn.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Paul wanted correction for the saving of
[1:42:40] the soul to save a brother because of
[1:42:42] love.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; And when the brother Amen. When the
[1:42:48] brother repented and wanted to come
[1:42:49] back, it was love and grace that wanted
[1:42:51] to be restored. The whole purpose was to
[1:42:54] be one. And it was not condemnation. The
[1:42:57] whole purpose was oneness.
[1:43:00] salvation,
[1:43:02] healing was the whole purpose.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; And so the message of grace, the the
[1:43:08] revelation of grace to me, the true
[1:43:12] revelation,
[1:43:13] it demands a response.
[1:43:16] Not demands a response in the way I did
[1:43:18] this, you have to do that. That's not
[1:43:19] what I mean by demands response. I mean
[1:43:22] the true revelation of what God did for
[1:43:24] us of grace. We cannot help but respond
[1:43:27] to that.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; When we really catch a revelation of
[1:43:30] what grace really is and what God did
[1:43:32] for us, there is no way we cannot
[1:43:34] respond to that. There's no way we
[1:43:36] cannot give him our love in our life.
[1:43:38] There is absolutely no way we can't.
[1:43:41] Amen. Because his love is drawing it out
[1:43:44] of us because of what he's done for us.
[1:43:46] And it changes the way we talk about one
[1:43:50] another. Changes the way we deal with
[1:43:51] one another. Changes the way we deal
[1:43:52] with all of humanity.
[1:43:55] because of our revelation of God's
[1:43:57] grace.
[1:43:59] Amen. If you could turn to Zechariah
[1:44:01] with me, I want to finish one one last
[1:44:03] thought
[1:44:04] and we'll finish with this.
[1:44:15] Zechariah chapter 4.
[1:44:24] We're going to go to Zechariah chapter 4
[1:44:25] and we're going to start reading from
[1:44:27] verse 6.
[1:44:34] says, "When he answered and spake unto
[1:44:36] me, saying, this is the word of God of
[1:44:38] the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying, not by
[1:44:41] might, nor by power, but by my spirit,
[1:44:44] sayeth the Lord of hosts. Who art thou,
[1:44:47] oh great mountain before Zerubabel, thou
[1:44:49] shalt become a plain, and he shall bring
[1:44:51] forth the headstone thereof with
[1:44:53] shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto
[1:44:56] it."
[1:44:57] Brother Brandham takes this scripture
[1:45:01] and and he brings it into a message
[1:45:03] called the message of grace. He preached
[1:45:05] in in o uh August of 1961 and he refers
[1:45:09] to this scripture and I love the way he
[1:45:11] referred to it because here we see a
[1:45:13] crying of grace grace. Amen. Not just
[1:45:16] grace but grace grace. It puts double
[1:45:18] emphasis and everything in the Bible
[1:45:20] that they wanted to be heavily
[1:45:22] emphasized was repeated like verily
[1:45:24] verily. So here the emphasis is on
[1:45:27] grace, grace, grace. And it has to do
[1:45:29] with Zerubabel. And Zerubabel, Amen, is
[1:45:31] the prince. He's the governor that's
[1:45:33] over Jerusalem at the time of coming out
[1:45:35] of Babylon. They're returning from
[1:45:37] Babylon. Amen. After they've they've
[1:45:40] fallen away from God. The temple's
[1:45:41] destroyed. They've gone captive in the
[1:45:43] Babylon. Now the a remnant of them is
[1:45:46] returning and they're going to rebuild
[1:45:47] the temple. And Zerubabel is the
[1:45:49] captain. He's the leader, the governor
[1:45:51] under that rebuilding process. and he's
[1:45:53] going to he's going to lay the
[1:45:54] foundation, but he's also going to bring
[1:45:56] forth the headstone or the capstone with
[1:45:58] shoutings of grace, grace. And God wants
[1:46:00] them to know that this is grace.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; This return and this restoration is
[1:46:07] grace. So, brother Bam picks it up in
[1:46:10] the message of grace. I love this. He
[1:46:12] says, "We are we are all acquainted with
[1:46:15] this scripture that reads the Bible. We
[1:46:18] know that this was during the time of
[1:46:19] the preparation of the restoration of
[1:46:21] the temple and Zerubbabel was a great
[1:46:24] prince amongst the people who had laid
[1:46:26] the foundation of the building. Now I
[1:46:28] want you to put on your spiritual
[1:46:29] thinking anointed jackets this morning
[1:46:31] as we think.
[1:46:33] And this great prince had determined to
[1:46:35] rebuild the house of the Lord. And then
[1:46:37] when he did he had laid the foundation.
[1:46:40] Now, there's a reason the prophet tells
[1:46:41] us to put on your spiritual thinking
[1:46:43] anointed jacket
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; because he wants us to understand
[1:46:46] something more than what happened in the
[1:46:48] book of Zechariah and what happened
[1:46:51] hundreds of years ago. He wants to bring
[1:46:53] it right up to what's going on right
[1:46:54] now.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And he says now he laid the foundation.
[1:46:59] And as we read on farther, we find out
[1:47:01] that God said Zerubabel has laid the
[1:47:03] foundation with his hands. He also shall
[1:47:06] bring forth the headstone. I want you to
[1:47:08] notice he never said he shall bring
[1:47:10] forth the cornerstone. He shall bring
[1:47:11] forth the headstone.
[1:47:14] And we know that the scripture says that
[1:47:16] Jesus is the chief cornerstone. And he's
[1:47:19] also the headstone. Now, if we will
[1:47:21] think for a few minutes, the seventh
[1:47:24] church messenger was to restore the
[1:47:26] faith of the children back to the
[1:47:28] fathers. In other words, rebuild the
[1:47:30] church again under the power of the
[1:47:32] spirit. Not by power, not by might, but
[1:47:35] by my spirit. He's quoting Zechariah. By
[1:47:37] my spirit, sayith the Lord, not by
[1:47:39] organization, not by denomination, but
[1:47:41] by the Holy Spirit. God will bring forth
[1:47:43] the church in the last day. Zerubabel
[1:47:45] the prince with Joshua was the one that
[1:47:47] was to bring forth this headstone. He
[1:47:50] had laid the foundation. He had to took
[1:47:52] the people back to the foundation in
[1:47:54] type. Brother Re's telling us now, this
[1:47:58] seventh angel is going to do the same
[1:48:00] thing that Zerubbabel is doing. He's
[1:48:01] tying the ministry of Zerubbabel to the
[1:48:03] ministry of the seventh angel. and the
[1:48:05] ministry of the seventh angels, the
[1:48:06] seventh church age messenger which is
[1:48:08] William Brham and he came to do what?
[1:48:10] Bring us out of Babylon which was
[1:48:12] denominationalism
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; and bring us back to a restoration of
[1:48:17] the temple of God. What is the temple of
[1:48:19] God? The church is the temple of God.
[1:48:21] You are the habitation of God. You are
[1:48:23] the temple of the Holy Ghost. And he
[1:48:25] goes back to the foundation because Paul
[1:48:27] says, "I laid the foundation." And he
[1:48:29] brings us back to the foundation that
[1:48:31] Paul laid. That's why brother Brenham
[1:48:33] taught what Paul taught.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Tied together the loose ends. And so he
[1:48:37] brought us back. Amen. And begin to
[1:48:39] build on that. But at the end of his
[1:48:40] ministry, he's going to bring forth.
[1:48:43] Amen. What? Christ again. The
[1:48:44] headstone's going to come down to cap
[1:48:47] off this church, to cap off this temple
[1:48:49] in the end time under the ministry of
[1:48:52] the seventh angel. And what is going to
[1:48:54] be crying? Amen. Unto that unto that
[1:48:57] that that that headstone that's coming
[1:48:59] down, the headship that's coming to the
[1:49:01] church. It's going to be crying out
[1:49:03] grace, grace unto it. Amen. Because this
[1:49:06] building realizes it's your grace. Your
[1:49:09] grace. A double emphasis on grace.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a church, a bride at
[1:49:14] the end time. And she's going to know
[1:49:16] she had nothing to do with it. It's
[1:49:18] purely by the grace of God. And we've
[1:49:20] come to the capping of the the pyramid,
[1:49:22] the capping of the temple, the headship
[1:49:24] of Christ to unify with his body. And
[1:49:27] what is the what is the major
[1:49:29] declaration at that time? Grace.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the church had went into
[1:49:39] ruin. Why? Because they took wrong
[1:49:41] ideas.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; They left the word of God. They left
[1:49:45] what Paul had taught. They added to.
[1:49:47] They took away. They got deceived by the
[1:49:49] Antichrist spirit. They went far away
[1:49:51] and did horrible things and made grace a
[1:49:54] disgrace. And they they they trashed the
[1:49:56] word of God. They did all of that. And
[1:49:58] why didn't God just leave them like
[1:50:00] that? because he had a predestinated
[1:50:02] plan and he had grace. Amen. And by his
[1:50:04] grace, he said, "I will restore."
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; That wasn't because anybody earned it.
[1:50:10] That was because he he had already put
[1:50:13] his love upon his elect and already put
[1:50:15] grace upon them.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; That's why when we come to the end of
[1:50:19] the message, Amen. What is the capping
[1:50:22] off? What is the response from
[1:50:24] Zerubabel? What is the response? What's
[1:50:26] being cried unto this headstone that's
[1:50:28] coming down? The cry is grace, grace. We
[1:50:31] don't deserve this. We haven't earned
[1:50:33] this. We are unworthy creatures, but
[1:50:35] you're choosing to live in us. You're
[1:50:38] choosing to unify with us. You're
[1:50:40] bringing us into the invisible union.
[1:50:42] And the only thing that we can cry at
[1:50:44] the capping time is grace. Grace,
[1:50:48] marvelous, abundant, overwhelming grace.
[1:50:52] How could we as human beings making
[1:50:55] mistakes? How could we, those of us who
[1:50:57] hands have done such evil, minds have
[1:50:59] thought such wickedness, mouth have
[1:51:01] spoke such evil things? How dare we say
[1:51:04] that we're the bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:51:06] the tabernacle and dwelling place of
[1:51:08] God? How dare we, as filthy as we have
[1:51:11] been, and willfully so, how dare we say
[1:51:13] that? There's only one way we can say
[1:51:15] it. It's not by intellectualism. It's
[1:51:17] not by merit. It is by grace. Grace.
[1:51:20] abundant grace. There's no way the bride
[1:51:23] in the end time could feel special like
[1:51:25] I'm special and God chose me cuz I'm
[1:51:27] special. No. God chose me despite how
[1:51:30] despicable I was. But he did it by his
[1:51:32] grace.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; He had before the foundation of the
[1:51:36] world chose me. He had placed something
[1:51:37] in me to sure his choice won't get lost.
[1:51:39] And it's by grace through faith.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; And that not of ourselves. It is the
[1:51:46] gift of God.
[1:51:48] I say God, help us keep the true
[1:51:52] attitude of love and response to grace
[1:51:56] by a true revelation of grace.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on to say, "In the
[1:52:02] message of grace, but now according to
[1:52:04] the prophecy, there will come the
[1:52:06] headstone." And I want you to notice
[1:52:08] that when the headstone comes, the
[1:52:10] prince that's going to cry out the
[1:52:12] message will cry out, "Grace! Grace! For
[1:52:16] it's by grace are we saved, that not of
[1:52:18] works, lest any man should boast. And
[1:52:20] the message of grace has been tramped
[1:52:22] under the feet of men until it's become
[1:52:24] a disgrace. Some of them runs out on
[1:52:26] eternal security. Some runs out into oh
[1:52:29] everything. But the true message of
[1:52:31] grace remains the same. And there's
[1:52:33] where Satan tries to knock it out from
[1:52:35] the church. But it's the grace of God
[1:52:37] that we're all saved by. One of the most
[1:52:40] fundamental teachings in the word of God
[1:52:44] becomes the great cry when the headstone
[1:52:47] is descending. One of the basics, the
[1:52:50] basic understanding that in the New
[1:52:51] Testament that we're saved by grace
[1:52:53] depart apart from works. At the end of
[1:52:56] it all, Christ is the cornerstone and
[1:52:59] the buildings all fitly framed together
[1:53:01] with Paul laid the foundation and then
[1:53:03] brother Brandham brought us back to the
[1:53:05] foundation of what Paul taught. build
[1:53:07] back the church from there all the way
[1:53:09] to the capping time where the headstone
[1:53:10] comes down. And when it comes down, all
[1:53:13] the revelations and all that build upon
[1:53:15] this word comes back to a declaration at
[1:53:18] the capping time. A cry that goes out,
[1:53:20] grace,
[1:53:22] grace.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we should love grace.
[1:53:28] Brother Benham calls the church the
[1:53:29] bridegrace
[1:53:33] because it's all by grace. You and I
[1:53:37] can't be bride by effort, merit, good
[1:53:40] conduct, knowledge, skill, right living.
[1:53:45] We can only be bride by grace.
[1:53:48] And if God can have grace on me, we can
[1:53:51] have grace on everyone else.
[1:53:56] Last scripture, musicians, if you want
[1:53:58] to come, please. And brother John. For
[1:54:00] this is the love of God that we keep his
[1:54:03] commandments and his commandments are
[1:54:06] not grievious.
[1:54:08] How can they be
[1:54:11] when we have a revelation of grace? How
[1:54:14] can the Lord's commandments be
[1:54:16] grievious?
[1:54:18] When when brother Brandham, he tells us
[1:54:21] a story. He takes us back in the Old
[1:54:24] Testament to when David and his mighty
[1:54:27] men were holed up in a cave. And between
[1:54:30] them and Bethlehem was a garrison of
[1:54:33] Philistines.
[1:54:34] And that garrison of Philistines was was
[1:54:37] there and they were trapped in the spot.
[1:54:39] And and David, he was thirsty. He was
[1:54:41] hot. Brother Beam dramatizes the whole
[1:54:43] thing and begins to share it. And and he
[1:54:45] says, "Oh, I just long. Oh, I just would
[1:54:48] love to drink from the water of the well
[1:54:50] of Bethlehem one more time.
[1:54:53] And and brother Ben Brandham said,
[1:54:55] there's three men that overheard him say
[1:54:57] that. That wasn't a command from a
[1:54:59] captain to soldiers. That wasn't
[1:55:02] anything that had to be carried out.
[1:55:04] That wasn't a command. That wasn't an
[1:55:06] order. That was a desire that was
[1:55:08] expressed.
[1:55:10] And and when that desire was expressed,
[1:55:13] there was three. And brother Brandham
[1:55:14] said they three, they loved him so much
[1:55:19] that his least desire was a command to
[1:55:21] them.
[1:55:23] And he said they took off without saying
[1:55:25] a word to anybody. And those three, they
[1:55:27] fought their way through an entire
[1:55:29] garrison of Philistine sand soldiers
[1:55:31] cutting right or left, went to the well,
[1:55:33] dipped a bucket of water out, and fought
[1:55:35] their way all the way back. They
[1:55:37] hazarded their lives. They risked every
[1:55:39] they listen you realize they risked
[1:55:42] absolutely everything because there was
[1:55:44] a man named David that they loved so
[1:55:46] much and respected so much that just his
[1:55:49] desire became a commandment to them.
[1:55:51] They weren't bound by a pecking order.
[1:55:53] They weren't bound by a general and
[1:55:55] subordinates. They were bound by chains
[1:55:57] of love. Amen.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And chains of love moved them to do what
[1:56:01] is is it moved them to do what is
[1:56:03] irrational, irresponsible, moved them
[1:56:05] beyond what would ever be expected of a
[1:56:08] human being. But what motivated them? It
[1:56:10] was their love and desire to please
[1:56:12] David. It was their desire to serve him.
[1:56:15] They loved him that much.
[1:56:18] Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; God help us to be Hey, listen. If that's
[1:56:24] an earthly love for an earthly man who
[1:56:26] was res resembling the king,
[1:56:27] representing the king that would come,
[1:56:29] what about when we're serving the true
[1:56:31] king? What about when we're married to
[1:56:33] the through the son of David? Amen. What
[1:56:35] about him? Can we have the same desire
[1:56:38] that it's not what I have to do? It's
[1:56:39] not what he makes me do. It's not what
[1:56:41] the orders are. But if I see the
[1:56:43] slightest desire, oh God, help me to
[1:56:45] give my life to please him. Help me to
[1:56:48] give my life. Why? Because I have to
[1:56:50] know because I love him that much.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; He has fought for me. He has saved me.
[1:56:56] He went into the pit. He He overcame. He
[1:56:59] slew Goliath.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; He's coming to his kingdom. He's allowed
[1:57:05] me
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; to be one of his mighty men. Listen,
[1:57:11] that's the way I want to serve my Lord.
[1:57:14] Your least desired to me to just to me
[1:57:17] that's the response to grace. That's a
[1:57:20] true revelation of grace. Not that I can
[1:57:23] do whatever I want. I can make my own
[1:57:25] decisions. Of course, you can. God
[1:57:26] doesn't force anything. But oh, when I
[1:57:30] lay down my rights, I become a lamb.
[1:57:34] When I give up my life and when I
[1:57:38] surrender all, that's when I show God, I
[1:57:42] I understand what you did for me and
[1:57:45] this is the least I can do for you. And
[1:57:50] God bless you all. Let's stand together.
[1:57:55] All I can say at the end of this is God
[1:57:57] help me. Amen.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; What's in my heart, what my desire is,
[1:58:02] my great longing to please him, to
[1:58:04] sacrifice myself, to stop giving in to
[1:58:07] the the whims of the flesh, to to to to
[1:58:10] give up anything that's selfish, to give
[1:58:12] myself completely to him. That desire is
[1:58:15] there, the want is there, but oh, I can
[1:58:19] only do it by his grace. So, I'm asking,
[1:58:22] Lord Jesus, would you please come and
[1:58:24] make this desire in my heart a reality
[1:58:27] in my life? I can't do it. Even though I
[1:58:29] want to, even though I've been born
[1:58:30] again, even though I have the desire, I
[1:58:32] can't do it without his grace.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads and pray. Lord
[1:58:38] Jesus, we thank you for your grace.
[1:58:41] God, we live in the hour, Lord, where
[1:58:43] we've heard the cry, grace, grace.
[1:58:48] God, you established the foundation on
[1:58:50] grace. You've built up your bride
[1:58:53] through seven church ages.
[1:58:55] You've come to the capping off with the
[1:58:58] great revelation of yourself.
[1:59:01] And that great revelation
[1:59:04] that comes with the shouting
[1:59:07] of grace. Grace.
[1:59:11] Not just an understanding of grace that
[1:59:13] was in the foundation, but through it
[1:59:14] all at the end when we look back and see
[1:59:17] where the church has always gone wrong,
[1:59:19] where your people has always failed,
[1:59:22] where you've brought us from. And by
[1:59:23] your love and grace, you covered our
[1:59:25] sins. And you brought us out again and
[1:59:27] again and again. And you built us up.
[1:59:29] You sent a prophet, Lord. And you gave
[1:59:31] us a heart to believe. And you've done a
[1:59:33] restoration work that we could never do
[1:59:35] ourselves. When we look at that Lord,
[1:59:38] there was grace at the foundation, but
[1:59:40] there's something in our hearts crying
[1:59:42] grace. Grace at the capping. This is
[1:59:46] nothing but pure grace. And God, I love
[1:59:50] you, Lord. You know my heart. God, I
[1:59:53] long to serve you. I long, Lord. I I I
[1:59:56] get so disappointed in myself because I
[1:59:58] see selfishness.
[2:00:01] I see self-des. And I see little excuses
[2:00:03] I make to allow myself little desires.
[2:00:07] And Lord, that's not really what I want.
[2:00:10] But Lord, from the depths of my soul,
[2:00:12] what I want is to be like those three
[2:00:14] captains that served David.
[2:00:18] Lord, if I just knew that's what you
[2:00:20] wanted, commandment or no commandment,
[2:00:23] that's what I want to do. God, would you
[2:00:25] bestow your grace upon me and help me
[2:00:28] overcome my flesh and help this desire
[2:00:31] in my heart, Lord, to come into
[2:00:33] manifestation?
[2:00:35] For I want to cry, Lord, seeing your
[2:00:38] capstone descended in this day. I want
[2:00:40] to cry grace, grace, abundant grace. And
[2:00:45] I want that revelation of grace to have
[2:00:48] an effect in my life. God, help us as we
[2:00:51] deal with your people, as we deal with
[2:00:53] humanity. May the grace you bestowed
[2:00:56] upon us, may we bestow that upon others.
[2:00:58] Lord, may we be tenderhearted, forgiving
[2:01:01] as you've forgiven us. May we never
[2:01:04] forget, Lord, may we be sober minded and
[2:01:06] never think of ourselves more highly
[2:01:08] than we ought to. But may we realize,
[2:01:11] Lord, that this is nothing but your
[2:01:12] grace in our lives. Not any merit of our
[2:01:15] own or works that we have done. There's
[2:01:16] no boasting and work, Lord. There's only
[2:01:19] boasting and grace. We're bragging on
[2:01:22] you for you've done it all. Your
[2:01:25] shoulders were broad enough. Your back
[2:01:26] was strong enough to bear our iniquities
[2:01:29] and sins. And you did it yourself. And
[2:01:32] Lord, we're so thankful. We love you.
[2:01:35] Bless your people as we go from here.
[2:01:36] May these realities go deeper and deeper
[2:01:39] into our souls. And may the outflow
[2:01:41] become a life that reflects this word.
[2:01:44] We love you, Father, and we ask your
[2:01:46] blessings in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:01:50] Amen.
[2:01:52] Amen. Brother John.
[2:01:54] Marvelous
[2:01:56] grace of our loving
[2:02:01] Lord.
[2:02:03] It's grace that exceeds
[2:02:08] our sin and our guilt.
[2:02:13] For yonder
[2:02:14] on Calary's
[2:02:18] clown
[2:02:19] out
[2:02:22] there where the blood of the lamb
[2:02:28] was spilled.
[2:02:31] Praise
[2:02:36] God.
[2:02:38] Grace,
[2:02:40] grace that will garden
[2:02:44] and cleans
[2:02:47] within
[2:02:50] grace.
[2:02:52] Praise.
[2:02:54] God's
[2:02:57] grace.
[2:02:59] grace that is greater than all
[2:03:05] our seed.
[2:03:08] Amen. I'd like to sing this again, but I
[2:03:10] I just want to bow our heads and pray
[2:03:12] for the fellowship that we're about to
[2:03:14] have that God's presence would remain
[2:03:16] from here into the fellowship and we'd
[2:03:18] feast on the things that we've heard.
[2:03:20] Let's pray together. Lord Jesus, God, as
[2:03:23] we've set this day aside, Lord, to spend
[2:03:25] the day together as a body, God, you
[2:03:27] have so fed us on your word and we're so
[2:03:29] thankful for the truth and reality. I
[2:03:32] now pray that you would bless, Lord, the
[2:03:34] food we're about to partake of and bless
[2:03:36] the fellowship. And God, may you be the
[2:03:39] central theme of all of our fellowship.
[2:03:40] For we recognize you abiding in these
[2:03:42] tabernacles of flesh. As we fellowship
[2:03:45] with one another, may we recognize
[2:03:47] what's going on deeper, but its
[2:03:48] attributes connecting again that came
[2:03:51] from your mind and now we're enjoying
[2:03:53] Lord fellowshipping with you and our
[2:03:56] brothers and sisters. May there be a
[2:03:58] sweet atmosphere and presence and may
[2:03:59] you bless us and may we take courage
[2:04:01] from it and strength from the
[2:04:03] fellowship. May we go and render to you
[2:04:05] back a life of service, Lord, as our
[2:04:08] love gift back to you. We thank you for
[2:04:10] this opportunity and pray you'd bless us
[2:04:12] in it. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:04:15] And God bless you. And I just want to
[2:04:17] remind you any visitors here, you're
[2:04:19] very welcome to stay. We'd love to have
[2:04:20] you join us. And also, if we could let
[2:04:23] our seniors go down first in line so
[2:04:24] they don't have to stand. Amen. God
[2:04:26] bless you all. We'll see you in a little
[2:04:28] bit.
[2:04:29] Oh sin and despair like the sea
[2:04:35] waves cold
[2:04:38] threatened
[2:04:40] the soul
[2:04:42] with infinite
[2:04:45] loss.
[2:04:47] Grace that is greater. Yes. Grace
[2:04:53] untold
[2:04:56] points to the reuge the mighty
[2:05:02] cross.
[2:05:04] Praise
[2:05:08] God.
[2:05:13] Grace that will pardon and bliss
[2:05:19] with the
[2:05:21] grace.
[2:05:24] Praise
[2:05:26] God's
[2:05:28] grace.
[2:05:30] Grace that is greater than all
[2:05:36] our sin
[2:05:38] and dark is the sea that we cannot
[2:05:45] hide.
[2:05:47] What can I
[2:05:52] wash it away?
[2:05:55] Oh Lord, there is flowing
[2:06:00] a crimson
[2:06:02] time
[2:06:04] wher
[2:06:06] snow you may be
[2:06:10] today
[2:06:13] great
[2:06:15] praise
[2:06:17] God
[2:06:21] praise
[2:06:23] to Garden
[2:06:26] [Music]
[2:06:27] within
[2:06:30] grace
[2:06:32] praise.
[2:06:34] God's
[2:06:36] grace,
[2:06:38] grace that is greater than all
[2:06:44] our sin,
[2:06:46] oh marvelous,
[2:06:49] infinite,
[2:06:51] matchless
[2:06:53] grace,
[2:06:55] freely bestow
[2:06:59] on all who
[2:07:04] You that are longing to see
[2:07:09] his face.
[2:07:12] Will you this moment
[2:07:16] his praise
[2:07:18] receive
[2:07:20] grace?
[2:07:22] Praise
[2:07:24] God.
[2:07:27] Grace,
[2:07:29] grace that will pardon and place
[2:07:34] within
[2:07:37] grace.
[2:07:39] Praise
[2:07:41] God.
[2:07:45] Grace that is greater than all
[2:07:51] our sin.
[2:07:54] Grace,
[2:07:56] praise.
[2:07:58] God's
[2:08:00] grace,
[2:08:02] grace that will pardon and bliss
[2:08:08] within
[2:08:11] grace.
[2:08:13] Praise
[2:08:15] God.
[2:08:17] Praise.
[2:08:19] Praise that is greater than all
[2:08:25] our see.
