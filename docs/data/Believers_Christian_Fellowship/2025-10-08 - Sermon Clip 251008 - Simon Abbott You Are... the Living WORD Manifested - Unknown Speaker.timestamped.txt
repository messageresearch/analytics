[0:00] We stand reflecting him.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; We are standing now. We've been given
[0:07] the clothes. We're wearing those
[0:09] clothes. We can say truly we're only
[0:12] standing there when he does it.
[0:14] Sometimes, you know, you know, when when
[0:17] you go to a brother or a sister and
[0:18] they're in need, you don't even know it.
[0:20] So, you go to visit somebody, you just
[0:21] feel in your heart, I'm going to go and
[0:22] visit that bro. I'm going to visit that
[0:23] sis. It's like you go there, you talk to
[0:25] them, and afterwards they're like, you
[0:27] know, you wouldn't believe that really
[0:29] touched my heart. That's exactly what I
[0:30] need. And you're like, well, did you
[0:32] know what you were doing? No. So, no.
[0:34] And it's happened to each one of us.
[0:35] True. True. Happened to everyone, right?
[0:37] Okay. So, can you take credit for that?
[0:40] &gt;&gt; No. No. And how listen, how many people
[0:42] I Well, you see, I I dreamed a dream
[0:45] like
[0:47] &gt;&gt; No. No. Truly. So, if you go somewhere,
[0:49] you talk to them
[0:51] &gt;&gt; and how many times does it happen? Oh,
[0:53] do you know that really that's exactly
[0:54] what I needed? How did you know? Oh,
[0:56] brother Chad's preaching. It's like,
[0:58] mate, that's exactly what I'm going
[0:59] through. That's answered my questions.
[1:01] Can he take any credit for that?
[1:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; No. No. What is it? It's the the Lord
[1:08] manifesting himself through your room is
[1:10] standing there. You see, this is the
[1:12] thing now. What we need to realize,
[1:14] guys. You know, it's not hard for us to
[1:16] believe that brother the prophet, he's
[1:19] part of the bride. He's the, you know,
[1:20] that's that's not hard for us to
[1:21] believe. What's hard for us to believe
[1:23] is that we're part of that same
[1:24] category,
[1:25] &gt;&gt; right? He was only standing there when
[1:28] the Lord worked through him. And it
[1:30] might be a little bit lesser in our
[1:33] eyes. It might be a little bit more
[1:35] simple
[1:36] &gt;&gt; in our eyes because we don't have all
[1:39] the gifts. And but when the Lord uses
[1:41] you, it's the same thing.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; It's him working through you. Listen, be
[1:47] encouraged. Be encouraged because I know
[1:49] each and every one of you it's happened.
[1:50] You've gone to see somebody. You've
[1:51] spoken to somebody. You maybe sent a
[1:52] text. You sent some you some way of
[1:55] reaching out to somebody and they've
[1:56] written about that's just what I needed.
[1:58] You were only sending there when you
[2:00] flicked the text.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; When he did it,
[2:03] &gt;&gt; you were only standing there. He was
[2:05] working through you.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the Lord gets full
[2:09] preeminence in his bride, it will be
[2:11] literally, listen carefully, when the
[2:13] Lord gets full preeminence in his bride,
[2:15] it will be the same as when the Lord
[2:17] stood there and said,
[2:19] &gt;&gt; "Speak the word. You see me, you see the
[2:22] father.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus stood there and said,
[2:25] "You see me, you see the father." What's
[2:27] he saying? You see, you see the same
[2:28] thing. So now, actually, when the bride
[2:30] has full preeminence and you are the
[2:32] written epistle, then basically when
[2:34] people see me, they see this.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; So when you see me, you see the word.
[2:40] When you see me, you see the father.
[2:42] It's the same thing. I at that day, I in
[2:45] you, you in me. And it's the word. It's
[2:47] exactly right, brother. It's the word
[2:48] speaking through you. You can't help it.
[2:51] It just comes out. Amen. You see me. You
[2:53] see Listen.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; When you see me, you see the word that
[2:57] was preached in the seventh church age.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; You see the word that the prophet
[3:02] preached. When you see me,
