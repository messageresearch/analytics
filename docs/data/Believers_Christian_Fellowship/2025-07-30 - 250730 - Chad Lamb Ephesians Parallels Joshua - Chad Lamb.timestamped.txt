[13:04] Savior let me walk with thee.
[13:10] [Music]
[13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this evening.
[13:13] Let's b let's bow our heads together.
[13:16] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful,
[13:18] Father, for your tender mercies, your
[13:21] loving care, your great grace in our
[13:24] lives that has brought us back together
[13:25] again. And now, Lord, as we've Lord
[13:29] turned our hearts, Lord, to you through
[13:31] the singing, through the praises,
[13:33] through glorifying your name and lifting
[13:36] our voices and our hearts to you in
[13:37] worship. Now, Lord, we've come to come
[13:41] and place ourselves before you as you
[13:43] come and speak to us, your eternal
[13:45] words. For God, we want another portion
[13:48] of that word, another portion of
[13:49] yourself as you unveil yourself to us,
[13:52] as you teach us and instruct us. Lord, I
[13:54] pray you would do so by your own power,
[13:56] by your own spirit. May you take this
[13:59] vessel under your control. And may I
[14:00] just yield myself to you and may you
[14:03] come and break the bread of life. Lord,
[14:05] we stand here, Lord, wanting more,
[14:07] hungry for more of you. And I pray,
[14:09] Lord, that we come hungering and
[14:11] thirsting, we shall be filled, Lord, for
[14:14] that's your promise. Pray to have your
[14:16] way in this service with every word
[14:18] that's spoken. In Jesus Christ's name we
[14:20] pray. Amen.
[14:22] Amen. God bless you all. Amen. While
[14:25] we're standing this evening, if you
[14:26] could turn to the book of Ephesians,
[14:28] we're going to continue on uh in
[14:30] Ephesians.
[14:32] Amen. Uh I just want to say how much I
[14:34] enjoyed the Sunday service and I thank
[14:37] God for moving amongst us and thanks
[14:40] brother Jim for yielding himself and
[14:42] surrendering to the spirit of God. It
[14:44] was a refreshing time in the Lord. Amen.
[14:47] And also I want to let you know that
[14:49] this Sunday our brother Gabe Smith will
[14:51] be traveling out of town to minister.
[14:53] He'll be going to Dton, Ohio to preach
[14:55] for brother Steven Goulsby. So remember
[14:57] him and his family in prayer as they
[14:59] travel there and back and as he
[15:01] ministers the word there as well. Amen.
[15:04] While we're standing, let's take a look
[15:05] here at at Ephesians chapter 1 and let's
[15:09] just read verse one.
[15:14] says, "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
[15:16] by the will of God to the saints which
[15:19] are at Ephesus and to the faithful in
[15:22] Christ Jesus." So, is this letter
[15:24] written to you?
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you take your
[15:28] seats.
[15:29] Amen. God be praised. If we could pull
[15:32] up the overhead and we're going to start
[15:35] in, I want to go into the to the next
[15:38] step here. as I was studying and looking
[15:40] at this subject, uh, Brother Rem tells
[15:43] us that Ephesians parallels Joshua. And
[15:46] so, I want to take a look at that. So, I
[15:48] I I trust you all enjoyed the Bible
[15:50] study last time.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we if we had a if we had a
[15:55] good Bible study, let's have another
[15:56] good Bible study today. So, I'm going to
[15:58] kind of do the same format. I think
[16:00] we'll see how it goes. But, I enjoy just
[16:02] slowing down and going through the
[16:04] scriptures from time to time and and I I
[16:06] and I hope to do that again. So, just
[16:08] keep your Bibles handy. Remember
[16:10] remember our rule. If you fall asleep,
[16:11] you get to stand and read the scripture.
[16:14] I don't know if I'll ever actually make
[16:15] anybody do that, but I I love saying
[16:17] that. Amen. It makes me feel good.
[16:19] Anyways, amen. So, if we look at this,
[16:24] if we look at this uh quote here from
[16:27] adoption says, "Now, as we study
[16:29] together, I'd like to say this that this
[16:31] book of Ephesians perfectly parallels
[16:33] the Old Testament. Joshua, Ephesians,
[16:35] the book of Ephesians. So I want I want
[16:37] to see what brother Benham says about
[16:39] this and I want to look into this
[16:40] ourselves because as brother Benham says
[16:42] it parallels Joshua. I want to know how.
[16:45] I want to know why. I want to know in
[16:46] what way. And so we're just going to
[16:48] take a look at that Lord willing this
[16:49] evening. Amen. And as we do, I want you
[16:53] to notice that I think most every quote,
[16:56] almost every quote that I'm going to use
[16:58] tonight comes out of brother Bam's
[16:59] adoption series from 1960. So we're
[17:02] going to use quotes from adoption one
[17:03] and two and maybe three or four. I don't
[17:05] remember now, but but it's it's amazing
[17:07] that in adoption, he's telling us
[17:09] Ephesians parallels Joshua, and that's
[17:12] what he's going to get into. It has
[17:13] something to do with adoption. So, I
[17:15] want that in your mind to begin with as
[17:17] we move forward. Let's go a little
[17:19] further in Ephesians and turn to uh
[17:22] let's stay in chapter 1, but let's look
[17:24] at verse 7 together.
[17:27] in whom we have redemption through his
[17:29] blood, the forgiveness of sins,
[17:31] according to the riches of his grace.
[17:34] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[17:36] all wisdom and prudence, having made
[17:38] known unto us the mystery of his will,
[17:40] according to his good pleasure, which he
[17:42] hath purposed in himself, that in the
[17:45] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[17:47] he might gather together in one all
[17:49] things in Christ, both which are in
[17:51] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[17:53] him, in whom also we have obtained an
[17:56] inheritance, being predestinated
[17:59] according to the purpose of him who
[18:00] workketh all things after the counsel of
[18:03] his own will that we shall be to the
[18:05] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[18:07] Christ in whom ye also trusted after
[18:10] that you heard the word of truth the
[18:12] gospel of your salvation in whom also
[18:14] after that you believed you were sealed
[18:16] with the Holy Spirit of promise which is
[18:19] the earnest of your inheritance until
[18:21] the redemption of the purchased
[18:23] possession unto the praise of his glory.
[18:26] So as we read this, we find out that God
[18:28] did all of this according to his
[18:30] purpose, by his predestinated plan. And
[18:33] his predestinated plan was according to
[18:34] his will and according to his purpose.
[18:36] And according to his will and purpose
[18:38] that he was going to have grace by his
[18:40] grace, he was going to have favor upon
[18:42] us. And he was going to bring us into an
[18:45] inheritance in Christ because he was
[18:47] going to gather everything into Christ,
[18:49] all things which are in heaven and earth
[18:51] in him. And we are included in that. And
[18:53] we're found with an inheritance in that.
[18:55] Amen. Yeah. Right.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Why does this matter? Because the book
[18:58] of Joshua is all about their
[19:00] inheritance. Their inheritance. What God
[19:02] had promised to give them when they were
[19:04] as children of Abraham. He promised to
[19:06] give them the land. Amen. And now uh
[19:09] Joshua, the book of Joshua is bringing
[19:12] them across Jordan into the land to
[19:14] possess their inheritance. Amen. In
[19:16] Ephesians parallels Joshua. Amen. Where
[19:19] Paul is bringing the church. Amen. by
[19:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the
[19:24] land into Christ by the baptism of the
[19:26] Holy Ghost to possess every promise that
[19:28] is ours.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a parallel that brother
[19:33] Brandham was pointing to. We'll we'll
[19:35] read a few more quotes uh to show this
[19:39] God who's rich in mercies. As I was
[19:40] speaking last Sunday on the Ephesians,
[19:42] how that the book of Joshua was the
[19:44] Ephesians of the Old Testament and how
[19:46] it was a book of redemption and
[19:48] redemption has two different parts. Come
[19:51] out of and entering into first you have
[19:53] to come out. Some people wants to bring
[19:55] the the world in with them. But you got
[19:58] to come out of the world to enter into
[20:01] Christ. You see, they had to come out of
[20:03] Egypt.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Then they had to come out of the
[20:06] wilderness. They had to cross Jordan.
[20:07] They had to go all the way into the
[20:09] promise. Amen. And so, you've got to
[20:12] come out of the world to enter into
[20:13] Christ. You have to come out of unbelief
[20:15] to enter into faith. There cannot be one
[20:17] thing in your way to really have genuine
[20:19] faith. You must absolutely leave
[20:21] everything that's contrary to the word
[20:23] of God behind to enter into faith. And
[20:26] that was the book of Ephesians of the
[20:29] Old Testament, Joshua. So he keeps
[20:31] running this parallel uh back again to
[20:35] the adoption
[20:37] uh yeah adoption part one. Did you
[20:40] notice Joshua before they crossed
[20:42] Jordan, Joshua said, "Go through the
[20:44] midst of the camp and clean your clothes
[20:46] and sanctify every one of you and let no
[20:48] man come at his wife for three days.
[20:50] You'll see the glory of God." See, it is
[20:53] a process of getting ready to inherit
[20:55] the promise. So he's showing us there
[20:57] was a process and he's going to type it
[20:59] two ways. One, he says there's three
[21:00] days. Amen. He He says, "Wash your
[21:02] clothes." Amen. Come not at your wives.
[21:04] Amen. Separate yourselves and prepare.
[21:06] You're preparing for what? You're
[21:08] preparing to cross over Jordan. And he
[21:10] says there's a there's a process of
[21:12] getting ready to inherit the promise.
[21:14] Then he's going to type it to three
[21:15] stages of the journey. So now the
[21:17] promise to Israel, God gave Abraham the
[21:20] promise of the land of Palestine and it
[21:22] was to be their possession forever. And
[21:24] they was to always remain in this land.
[21:27] Now they come three stages coming to the
[21:30] promised land. Now watch it's perfectly
[21:32] typed in the New Testament. He goes on
[21:36] and he says there was three stages of
[21:38] the journey and there is three stages of
[21:41] this journey. For we are justified by
[21:43] faith, believing on the Lord Jesus
[21:45] Christ, forsaking the land of Egypt,
[21:47] come out and then are sanctified through
[21:48] the offering of his blood, washed from
[21:50] our sins, and become pilgrims and
[21:52] sojourers, claiming that we are seeking
[21:54] a land, a city that is coming or a
[21:57] promise. So, brother Benam is typing our
[22:00] journey through through justification,
[22:02] sanctification, the baptism of the Holy
[22:04] Ghost, coming out of Egypt. Amen. being
[22:06] separated through the wilderness journey
[22:08] and then a preparation to prepare to go
[22:12] all the way into the promised land. And
[22:14] that's how he's typing it. Amen. Here
[22:16] with Joshua. And so he says, let's go to
[22:19] Ephesians chapter 2.
[22:24] Ephesians chapter 2.
[22:27] Um I think I'm going to read from verse
[22:31] one.
[22:34] Yeah. And you hath he quickened, who
[22:37] were dead in trespasses and sins,
[22:39] wherein in time past you walked
[22:41] according to the course of this world,
[22:42] according to the prince of the power of
[22:44] the air, the spirit that now workketh in
[22:46] the children of disobedience, among whom
[22:48] also we all had our conversation in
[22:50] times past, and the lust of the flesh
[22:53] and of the mind, and were by nature
[22:55] children of wrath. Uh yeah, children of
[22:57] wrath, even as others. But God, who is
[23:00] rich in mercy, for his great love,
[23:01] wherewith he loved us, even when we were
[23:04] dead in sins, hath quickened us together
[23:06] with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and
[23:08] hath raised us up together, and made us
[23:10] sit together in heavenly places in
[23:12] Christ Jesus. So when we were dead, when
[23:15] we were in the world, when we were dead
[23:17] to the things of God, and separated and
[23:19] alienated, Amen. God by his grace had
[23:22] already made a provision for us in
[23:24] Christ. And he did it before the
[23:26] foundation of the world. Amen. But now
[23:28] you see Israel down in Egypt. They're
[23:31] dead to the promise. They're separated
[23:33] from everything. They're out of the
[23:34] promised land. They're as a dead nation,
[23:36] bound up in slavery. Amen. But there was
[23:39] a promise already made before. He told
[23:41] Abraham, "Thy children show Jordan in a
[23:44] strange land. But I'll bring them out
[23:46] with a mighty hand." His grace had
[23:48] already provided a deliverance. Amen. By
[23:50] predestination, by grace alone, not by
[23:53] their merit, not by their effort.
[23:55] Because the promise to Abraham was an
[23:57] unconditional promise based on grace,
[24:00] &gt;&gt; based on the will of God. And so they're
[24:02] down in Egypt, dead as a nation, dead to
[24:05] the promise, separated from everything,
[24:07] and no ability to do a thing for
[24:09] themselves, to deliver themselves or
[24:10] bring them into the promise. But God,
[24:13] amen, God by his infinite mercy, God by
[24:16] his fornowledge, God by his grace and
[24:18] his predestinated plan, he would come
[24:21] and raise them from the dead by his own
[24:23] hand. He delivered them with a mighty
[24:26] arm. Amen. What arm? His arm. Amen. He
[24:29] used Moses, but it was the hand of God.
[24:31] And he come and he delivered them
[24:33] himself by his own power. And that's
[24:36] what he did in Jesus Christ. He
[24:37] delivered us himself by his own power.
[24:41] It wasn't anything we did. It wasn't
[24:42] anything we could do. We were just as
[24:45] bound in slavery. We were just as
[24:47] separated from the promise. We were just
[24:49] as dead as the people of God as as they
[24:52] were in Egypt.
[24:55] But God brought us out by a mighty hand.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:02] Goes on to say, so Ephesians here sets
[25:06] us like Joshua positionally.
[25:09] You notice Joshua after crossing over
[25:11] the land and taking the land. Then he
[25:13] divided the land. Ephraim here, Manasseh
[25:16] here, and this one here, Gad here,
[25:19] Benjamin here. He divided the land. And
[25:22] this is where brother Benhams is
[25:23] breaking down how Ephesians types
[25:25] Joshua. And if you go back to chapter 1,
[25:28] we're going to go back to an important
[25:30] scripture that he's going to reference.
[25:31] Chapter 1 of Ephesians, verse three
[25:35] says, "Blessed be the God and father of
[25:38] our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
[25:40] us with all spiritual blessings in
[25:41] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[25:44] he hath chosen us in him before the
[25:46] foundation of the world, that we should
[25:48] be holy and without blame before him in
[25:50] love. having predestinated us unto the
[25:53] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[25:55] himself according to the good pleasure
[25:57] of his will. So here in the first
[26:00] chapter of Ephesians, he's telling us we
[26:02] were predestinated but there was a
[26:04] purpose in predestination. We were
[26:07] predestinated unto adoption.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the predestinated plan of God
[26:14] for all our adoption
[26:17] and we were predestinated unto adoption
[26:19] of the children by Jesus Christ to
[26:21] himself according to the good pleasure
[26:23] of his will. Not even according to our
[26:25] own thinking, our own desire, but the
[26:27] good pleasure of his will. So let's look
[26:30] at that as we continue on
[26:34] it again in adoption two. Your adoption
[26:37] is not your birth. Your adoption is your
[26:40] placing. When you were born again, John
[26:43] 1:17, I believe, when we are born of the
[26:45] spirit of God, we are sons of God. But
[26:47] we were predestined. Now, here's what
[26:49] I'm trying to get to you. For his sons
[26:51] of the last day, you see, see, we were
[26:53] predestinated unto adoption. Now, here
[26:57] we now here we are. Now, this is what
[27:00] hurts Pentecostal a little. They say, "I
[27:02] got born again. Praise the Lord. Got the
[27:03] Holy Ghost." Fine. You're a child of
[27:05] God. That's right. But yet, that ain't
[27:07] the whole talking. That's that ain't
[27:09] what I'm talking about. See, you were
[27:11] predestinated unto adoption. Adoption is
[27:14] placing a son.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; So, we weren't just predestinated to be
[27:18] born again. Amen. We were that was part
[27:20] of the plan of God. But we weren't just
[27:22] predestinated to be born again. Amen.
[27:24] Because then we would be born again and
[27:26] God would let us uh expire and we would
[27:28] go on to the sixth dimension and wait
[27:30] for the next phase. But that's not the
[27:32] purpose. The purpose was we were
[27:34] predestinated unto adoption. Amen.
[27:37] That's why we were born again so that we
[27:39] could grow under the tutor of the Holy
[27:41] Ghost all the way into the adoption to
[27:43] the placing that he wanted for us from
[27:45] before the foundation of the world.
[27:46] Because remember, God's plan foresaw you
[27:49] doing something for the kingdom.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; That's adoption. God foresaw you
[27:54] participating. He foresaw you in action.
[27:57] He foresaw you with gifts. He for
[27:59] foresaw you working his plan. He foresaw
[28:02] you as a son or daughter of God. Amen.
[28:04] And that's why we were predestinated
[28:06] unto adoption, not predestinated just to
[28:09] birth.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. They weren't just predestinated to
[28:14] enter into the land. Amen. In Joshua's
[28:16] day, but they had a specific place. They
[28:19] were predestinated to a position. Amen.
[28:21] In that position, Moses already spelled
[28:23] out that position. Jacob already spoke
[28:26] over them when he was dying. And when he
[28:28] drew his before he drew his legs up into
[28:29] his bed to die, he placed his hands on
[28:31] his sons and he positionally placed them
[28:34] in the land and spoke prophecy over each
[28:36] one of them.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in the journey, Amen.
[28:40] Then in the journey, Brother Brandham
[28:42] says those Hebrew women under labor
[28:44] pains. Amen. They would begin to speak
[28:46] the positional placing of those children
[28:49] as they were being born. And I don't
[28:51] believe they're I don't believe they
[28:52] said by the river Kedron,
[28:55] &gt;&gt; but they were speaking their tribal
[28:57] name. I mean, they were this was a birth
[28:59] of Ephraim. This was a birth unto Judah.
[29:02] This was a birth unto Manasseh. This was
[29:04] a birth unto unto Simeon. And that would
[29:06] place them in a specific place in the
[29:09] land.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; And then Moses would come along and
[29:12] Moses would tell them, "There's a place
[29:14] I'm dividing the land. It's going to be
[29:17] these dimensions and this is going to be
[29:19] how it's structured. Amen. But Moses
[29:22] never got Amen. Moses didn't cross
[29:25] Jordan. They went across with Joshua.
[29:27] Moses didn't place them in the land
[29:29] although he spoke it. Amen. The one who
[29:31] placed him was Joshua, a type of the
[29:33] Holy Ghost. Put them in their position.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Remember this is Ephesians and Joshua
[29:40] parallels Joshua and it has to do with
[29:43] adoption.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:46] So adoption is the placing
[29:49] of a son
[29:51] says but now to place. How are you're
[29:54] first born into the kingdom by the Holy
[29:56] Ghost. How many knows that? All right.
[29:58] The next you are predestinated unto
[30:00] what? Adoption. What is that? You are
[30:03] predestinated unto placing. Amen. I just
[30:06] want to slow down a minute because I get
[30:08] rolling so fast. I I mean for some
[30:11] people that's not fast. For me that's
[30:12] fast. For some people that's still slow.
[30:15] Amen. But but there's such a sometimes
[30:20] such a striving and such a striving and
[30:22] such a striving. Amen. For the new
[30:25] birth. And there should be because we've
[30:28] got to be born again by the spirit of
[30:30] God.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; It's essential. It's the starting place.
[30:34] We've got to be born again by the spirit
[30:36] of God. But then after you see somebody
[30:39] who settles their salvation in their
[30:41] heart, Amen. That's not the end of
[30:43] striving because we be should be
[30:44] striving for placing.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; We don't just stop. You know, somebody's
[30:50] born again. That's it. Woo. We made it.
[30:52] We crossed the line. We got in. I'm I'm
[30:54] I I'm secure. Listen, in the mind of
[30:57] God, you were secure before the
[30:58] foundation of the world. But you needed
[30:59] the experience of the new birth. Because
[31:01] you need the life, the power of the Holy
[31:03] Ghost to come in you to shape you for
[31:06] what? For placing. Amen.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; To give you the power to act out the
[31:11] word, to give you the power to live the
[31:14] life that he wants us to live.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; And so it's not, you know, the new birth
[31:18] isn't time to say, "Woo, I crossed the
[31:20] finish line and I'm going to go on
[31:21] vacation."
[31:24] &gt;&gt; We just got started, friends.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; That's just the beginning line. That's
[31:28] just where we begin.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Ephesians chapter 2,
[31:33] back to 2:8.
[31:36] For by grace are you saved through faith
[31:38] and not of yourselves. It is the gift of
[31:40] God, not of works, lest any man should
[31:43] boast. We for we are his workmanship.
[31:46] That means his creation what he made. We
[31:49] are his workmanship created in Christ
[31:50] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[31:53] before ordained that we should walk in
[31:55] them. So he we are saved by grace
[31:58] through faith and not of ourselves. It's
[32:00] a gift of God. Amen.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Not of works lest any boast. It wasn't
[32:04] anything we did, but he he did it and he
[32:06] did it for a purpose because he does
[32:08] have works for us to do
[32:11] &gt;&gt; because he created us for such.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; He made us to do something. He made us
[32:16] to accomplish something. He made us for
[32:19] a purpose. He called us for a purpose.
[32:21] He saved us for a purpose. He gave us
[32:23] his spirit for a purpose. And that was
[32:26] ordained before the foundation of the
[32:29] world.
[32:31] He says again, now who could doubt that?
[32:35] That's what Paul said. That's Paul's
[32:37] scripture. That's Paul's writing. That's
[32:39] what he taught his church. The church
[32:41] positionally before the foundation of
[32:43] the world when God in his labor pain was
[32:45] bringing forth bringing forth you
[32:47] knowing what you would do. He
[32:49] positionally placed you into his own
[32:51] body to be a housewife, to be a farmer,
[32:54] to be a preacher, to be a prophet, to be
[32:56] a this or to be a that. He placed you
[32:58] positionally.
[33:00] Then when we have come from the gardic
[33:02] lands of Egypt through sanctification is
[33:04] baptized into the promised land. For the
[33:06] promise of God is the Holy Ghost.
[33:08] Ephesians 4:30. Grieve not the Holy
[33:10] Ghost of God whereby you are sealed into
[33:12] the day of your redemption. I love this
[33:14] quote because I mean this the quotes and
[33:17] other quotes like this to me are such
[33:19] stabilizing quotes
[33:21] &gt;&gt; because he says he positionally placed
[33:24] you into his body when before the
[33:26] foundation of the world
[33:28] &gt;&gt; to be a housewife
[33:31] &gt;&gt; to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a
[33:34] prophet to be this or to be that.
[33:36] Sometimes when we think of positional
[33:38] placing in the kingdom of God. Amen.
[33:40] Sometimes we think too high. Amen.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; We start thinking of an office or an
[33:45] officer in the church or or something
[33:47] that takes place on the platform on
[33:49] Sunday and Wednesday. But listen, this
[33:51] this isn't the church. This is a
[33:53] building that we've set aside for our
[33:54] gathering together, for the preaching of
[33:56] the word, for the worship that we do
[33:58] communally together. But the church is
[34:00] you. Amen. You're the church. The body
[34:03] of Jesus Christ. Wherever you go is the
[34:05] church. Not just here is church. Church
[34:07] is everywhere the body of Christ is.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:11] So when he positionally places us in the
[34:13] church, it wasn't positionally placed
[34:16] during the church service position but
[34:18] in the church body.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; I hope that helps because sometimes we
[34:24] think brother says you know what can I
[34:26] do? He he makes these statements what
[34:27] can I do? I'm just a mechanic. I'm just
[34:29] a this. I'm just a that. He said that's
[34:31] exactly where God wants you to be
[34:33] because that's where he wants his life
[34:34] to emanate from. He's positionally
[34:37] placed you there and there's a sphere of
[34:39] influence that you have and he wants to
[34:40] use you there.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that's the only place
[34:44] that God will use you.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean it's the only thing that
[34:49] you're going to ever do and the only
[34:51] position you ever have, but it's the
[34:52] position you're in.
[34:55] Amen.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; One thing that I've I found
[34:59] in my own self and through others that I
[35:01] talk to many many times is when we look
[35:06] uh when we look really hard and we're
[35:08] striving for position and we get the
[35:12] wrong idea of what that means to strive
[35:14] perfect position. I think sometimes we
[35:17] forget the position we're in.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Right. You know, even in the in the uh
[35:26] example that brother Benham gives us of
[35:28] a son that's coming to adoption over his
[35:30] father's estate. He's a son, but he's
[35:33] put under tutors. He's learning lessons
[35:35] because he's going to need those lessons
[35:36] later. Listen, I I'm just going to say
[35:39] this and I I hope I hope it comes
[35:41] understandable.
[35:43] But when he's there learning his lessons
[35:45] under the tutor, he's in position,
[35:47] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; That may not be the goal. That may not
[35:51] be the entire destination. That may not
[35:53] be the only thing that he he's destined
[35:55] for more than that. But at that time,
[35:58] that's his position. His position is to
[36:00] learn the lesson. His position is to
[36:02] learn to follow the word of the father.
[36:04] His his position is to learn to listen
[36:06] to the tutor because the tutor knows the
[36:08] mind of God.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; He's learning a lot and he's in
[36:11] position. And if he stays in position,
[36:14] God will keep moving his position.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:19] But if he try, brother Bam says we try
[36:21] to climb the ladder too high and we skip
[36:23] the rung and we fall and we break our
[36:24] necks.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; We try to over climb things because we
[36:28] have our own ideas of things instead of
[36:30] just being positioned by God and saying
[36:33] God, amen, teach me everything I need to
[36:36] know today. Amen. Help me to be
[36:37] sensitive to your spirit. Help me to be
[36:39] alert to the thing that you're teaching
[36:41] me. Help me help me to grow. Help me to
[36:44] learn. Help me to manifest you right
[36:46] where I am today.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; I say this many times, but I believe we
[36:50] should as Christians, we should bloom
[36:51] wherever we're planted. Wherever you're
[36:53] at, every whatever position you're in,
[36:56] if it's in the home or out of the home,
[36:58] if it's in school or if it's in work,
[36:59] wherever God has planted you, we should
[37:02] be blooming out like Mr. Lily. Amen.
[37:05] Coming up through the muck of this world
[37:06] and letting ourselves bloom out. Amen.
[37:08] so that everybody can enjoy the beauty
[37:10] and fragrance of Christ,
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ that's living in us.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's not take positional
[37:18] placing and and and put and defer it too
[37:20] much.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; The father's in control of that.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Remember, the father's in control of the
[37:27] positional placing of the son. And the
[37:29] father's responsible for the adoption
[37:31] process.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; So, all the son can do is respond to the
[37:36] lessons of the tutor.
[37:38] and the tutor's checking up with the
[37:39] father and the father's moving the
[37:41] program along. Amen. So, so don't worry
[37:44] about what am I supposed to do five
[37:46] years from now. Amen. Let's try to
[37:48] figure out what we're supposed to be
[37:49] doing today.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I promise if we are
[37:54] predestinated unto adoption and we are
[37:57] his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[37:59] and good works which were before
[38:00] ordained that we should walk in them,
[38:02] we're going to get there.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; I just would like to get there easier.
[38:08] with
[38:10] &gt;&gt; yeah with less detours. You know,
[38:13] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of repeating grades. Let's put
[38:15] it that way.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; I may be in the fourth grade, but I'm
[38:17] tired of seeing this fourth grade desk
[38:19] for the third time. I'd like to go to
[38:21] fifth grade.
[38:22] [Laughter]
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad you foresaw it all and
[38:29] had a plan because I would have sure
[38:30] messed it up, failed, and
[38:32] &gt;&gt; whatever. probably wouldn't have got out
[38:34] of spiritual kindergarten if it wasn't
[38:35] but by the grace of God.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[38:41] he goes on, he says, "When did you did
[38:45] you notice Moses, that great miracle
[38:47] performer that brought down Israel down
[38:49] through the land and brought them up to
[38:51] the promised land, but did not place
[38:53] their inheritance to them? He did not
[38:55] give them their inheritance. He led them
[38:56] up to the land, but Joshua divided the
[38:58] land to the people." Is that right?
[39:02] And Christ brought the church up to the
[39:03] place where their possession was made to
[39:05] them was given to them just the Jordan
[39:08] to cross. But the Holy Spirit is the one
[39:09] who sets the church in order. The Joshua
[39:12] of today puts the church in its order,
[39:14] giving to each one gifts, places,
[39:17] positions, and he is the voice of God
[39:19] speaking to the inner man that Christ is
[39:21] saved, the Holy Spirit. Now, do you get
[39:24] that much of it? Now, we're getting over
[39:26] into the book of Ephesians. Now the same
[39:28] way he's positionally placed the church
[39:31] where they belong. Now Joshua placed
[39:33] them in the natural land. Now the Holy
[39:35] Spirit is placing the church
[39:36] positionally in the land in the position
[39:39] that they belong in their inheritance.
[39:42] So is that what God's doing for you and
[39:44] I.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Let's turn to Ephesians
[39:47] chapter 4 now.
[39:51] Ephesians chapter 4 and I'd like to look
[39:54] at verse seven and 8.
[39:58] But unto every one of us is given grace
[40:01] according to the measure of the gift of
[40:03] Christ.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherefore he saith, when he
[40:07] ascended up on high, he led captivity
[40:10] captive and gave gifts unto men.
[40:13] Whatever we have in us, whatever's been
[40:17] imparted unto us by the by the mind of
[40:20] God and by the Holy Ghost is grace.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] It's not us. It's God's grace.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:31] But
[40:32] everyone in his kingdom, in his economy,
[40:36] every one of his children,
[40:38] everyone has been given a grace
[40:40] according to the measure of the gift of
[40:42] Christ.
[40:44] Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up
[40:46] on high, he led captivity captive and
[40:48] gave gifts unto men. He didn't leave
[40:51] anybody with nothing.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:55] There's no one with nothing.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Everybody's been imparted a measure of
[40:59] grace of the gift of Christ. And for
[41:02] that we should glory.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; And because of that, God has designed it
[41:08] so that we need each other. And and that
[41:12] is also a wonderful thing.
[41:15] Let's look at further down here in
[41:17] Ephesians chapter 4
[41:20] and let's go to verse 11. And he gave
[41:24] some apostles and some prophets and some
[41:26] evangelists and some pastors and
[41:28] teachers for the perfecting of the
[41:31] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[41:32] for the edifying of the body of Christ,
[41:35] till we all come into the unity of the
[41:37] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[41:39] God unto a perfect man, unto the measure
[41:42] of the stature of the fullness of
[41:43] Christ, that we henceforth be no more
[41:46] children tossed to and fro and carried
[41:47] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[41:50] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[41:52] whereby they lie and wait to deceive.
[41:54] But speaking the truth in love, may grow
[41:56] up into him and all things which is the
[41:58] head, even Christ, from whom the whole
[42:01] body fitly joined together and compacted
[42:04] by that which every joint supplieth
[42:06] according to the effectual working in
[42:07] the measure of every part, making
[42:09] increase of the body unto the edifying
[42:11] of itself in love.
[42:15] This is positional placing.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] This is this is the body of Christ
[42:21] moving into do adoption, moving up into
[42:24] the perfect man. And he starts talking
[42:26] about the ministry gifts that he gives
[42:28] that are the ministry gifts of Jesus
[42:30] Christ. And and as far as apostles,
[42:32] prophets, evangelists, pastors, and
[42:34] teachers. Amen. They're given for a
[42:37] purpose. They're given for the building
[42:38] up of the body of Christ. Amen. And as
[42:40] they they build up till we all come in,
[42:43] basically saying till we all come into
[42:45] the stature of a perfect man. Amen. And
[42:47] this is being built up in us, but it's
[42:49] also being built up over seven ages.
[42:51] It's coming through the stature of
[42:52] perfect man, building the church back to
[42:54] that perfect image of Jesus Christ.
[42:55] Amen.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; But when that body comes together now,
[42:59] when they come when they coalesce and
[43:01] come together, Amen. under this building
[43:04] up of the body under this uh measure of
[43:06] the stature of fullness of Christ, it is
[43:08] so that we're henceforth no more
[43:10] children tossed to and fro and carried
[43:12] about by the slide of men and the
[43:14] cunning crabs whereby they lie and wait
[43:16] and deceive, but speaking the truth in
[43:18] love may grow up into him in all things
[43:20] which is the head even Christ. Now verse
[43:22] 16. From whom the whole body fitly
[43:26] joined together and compacted by by wi
[43:30] by that which every joint supplieth.
[43:33] Now he started off talking about a
[43:35] five-fold ministry. He talked about a
[43:37] ministry gifts of Christ that came to
[43:38] build up the church. But that wasn't the
[43:41] end of it.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Because now as the church comes together
[43:44] and is built up, Amen. It's it is it is
[43:48] from from the headship of Christ. The
[43:51] whole body has to be fitly joined
[43:53] together and compacted by that which
[43:56] every joint supply. Now it's not just
[43:59] what the five-fold ministry does to
[44:01] edify. Now it's compacted together and
[44:03] fit together by what every joint
[44:05] supplies.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the purpose.
[44:10] according to the effectual working in
[44:13] the measure of every part,
[44:16] making increase of the body unto the
[44:19] edifying of itself in love. Making
[44:22] increase of the body, building the body,
[44:24] edifying, building up the body in love.
[44:27] Who's now responsible for building up
[44:29] the body? It's not just a five-fold
[44:31] ministry. It's every joint that
[44:33] supplies.
[44:35] It's the effectual working in the
[44:37] measure of every part that Christ is
[44:39] working through every joint, every part
[44:42] in this body to what? Amen. To increase
[44:45] the body unto the edifying building up
[44:48] of itself in love. So the building up of
[44:51] the body of Christ is not just the work
[44:53] of the five-fold ministry. It's the work
[44:55] of every part as it supplies. Every
[44:57] joint as it supplies every part supplies
[45:00] every part that's in position. Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; It's become super super important. Amen.
[45:11] Brother M said, "Even if it's just a
[45:13] little tip of my pinky, I want it to
[45:15] stay right there.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what the joint is, what
[45:18] the part is." Amen. If we think that
[45:20] we're the lowest of the lowest and I'm
[45:22] the worst of the worst. Listen, I don't
[45:24] care if you consider me the lowest of
[45:25] the lowest and the worst of the worst.
[45:27] As long as I'm part of that body, I can
[45:29] be the most minuscule part joint that
[45:31] there is. the most the most uncumbly
[45:34] part, the thing that nobody sees and
[45:35] never gets noticed and lives all of its
[45:37] life working in the internals and nobody
[45:39] ever knows what the spleen does or what
[45:42] this cell does or whatever this thing
[45:44] inside my body. There's so many things
[45:46] in my body, I don't know what it's
[45:47] doing.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; I don't even know what the name is. I
[45:50] don't even know what the function is. I
[45:52] don't even know how many parts there
[45:53] are. Amen. But but they're all working
[45:55] together to increase me, to edify me, to
[45:58] build me up.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; And I'm It doesn't matter what part we
[46:04] are as long as I'm part of that. Amen.
[46:06] What g more glorious position can we
[46:08] have to be part of the body of Jesus
[46:10] Christ?
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] Praise be to God. Amen. And and usually
[46:17] what usually what I find and what I
[46:19] happen what happens to me most of the
[46:21] time when I talk to people, they they
[46:23] they uh undervalue their contribution to
[46:27] the body.
[46:28] Almost everybody you've heard the same
[46:30] thing. I don't really do nothing. I
[46:32] don't And you're looking at them like
[46:33] what do you mean you don't do nothing?
[46:35] Like you you're you do more work than
[46:37] the rest of us. We love everything you
[46:39] do and you do this and you do that.
[46:41] Everybody else can see it, but we
[46:42] ourselves so many times can't. So we
[46:45] undervalue ourselves and we belittle
[46:47] ourselves. But listen, God didn't birth
[46:49] you into his body to do nothing. He
[46:51] didn't he didn't leave you without a
[46:53] measure of grace according to the gift
[46:54] of Christ. He didn't he didn't tag you
[46:57] on as an extra part that doesn't supply
[46:59] anything. We're all here to do something
[47:01] for the kingdom of God. And this has
[47:03] everything to do with positional
[47:04] placing. Has everything to do with the
[47:06] book of Joshua, the book of Ephesians,
[47:08] has everything to do with our whole life
[47:09] and our purpose for being here.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] Amen. So my advice, I've given it
[47:18] before, but I I'll give it again.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; It's free,
[47:22] &gt;&gt; so it might be worth what you paid for
[47:23] it.
[47:26] Don't worry about what you're supposed
[47:27] to do. Just do whatever comes to your
[47:29] hand.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Do what you like. Do what you're
[47:33] inspired to do. Do do what you find
[47:37] yourself doing.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. God will
[47:40] positionally place everybody. Just do
[47:42] what whatever your hand find it to do.
[47:45] Do it with all your might.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; And be happy in doing it. Yes.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Be happy in doing it. Don't don't don't
[47:56] ever use anything God's given you to do
[47:58] as a stepping stone to something else.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Because if you use any position or
[48:03] anything, a gift or anything that God
[48:05] has given you to do in the body, if you
[48:07] use it as a stepping stone to something
[48:09] else, I got a feeling you're going to
[48:10] stay on that stepping stone and that
[48:11] stepping stone will become a landing.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Because that's not the right attitude.
[48:19] right attitude. Whatever God has given
[48:20] me, whatever I can do, I want to do it
[48:22] with my full heart.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:27] And this this next quote, Brother Be
[48:30] says, "But when they are born and
[48:32] positionally born into the kingdom of
[48:34] God, then the Holy Ghost is set in the
[48:36] church, some apostles, some prophets,
[48:39] some teachers, some pastors, some
[48:40] evangelists. Then he's given into theirs
[48:43] speaking with tongues, interpretation of
[48:45] tongues, knowledge, wisdom, gifts of
[48:47] healing, all kinds of miracles. When the
[48:49] church, now this is my purpose of doing
[48:51] this. The church is always trying to
[48:54] take somebody else's corner, but don't
[48:56] do that. You can never raise corn in
[48:58] Ephraim's corner if you're Manasseh.
[49:00] You've got to take your place in Christ.
[49:02] Positionally take it. Oh, it gets deep
[49:05] and rich when we get in here. how that
[49:07] God puts one in the church to speak with
[49:09] tongues another. Now, we have been
[49:11] taught many times we all have to speak
[49:13] with tonesues. That's wrong. We all got
[49:15] to do it. No, we don't. They all didn't
[49:18] do one thing. Each one was the land was
[49:20] provided and divvied up by inspiration.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram goes on to explain this out
[49:25] of the book of Joshua. He says it was
[49:28] given divvied up by inspiration. They
[49:29] didn't all do the same thing. They all
[49:31] lived in different parts of this land.
[49:33] And this land is very diverse. If you
[49:35] look at the nation of Israel, there's
[49:37] mountains and there's plains. There's
[49:38] river sides and there's oceanside.
[49:40] There's the the the coast of the of the
[49:43] uh of the sea of whatever Tiberius,
[49:47] Ganesserat, uh all kinds of names, but
[49:49] anyways, you know what I'm talking
[49:50] about. And where were they positionally
[49:53] placed? It had to do with what
[49:54] occupation they would do, whether they
[49:56] grow wheat, whether they they'd raise
[49:57] goats, whether they'd raise sheep,
[49:59] whatever they would do, whether they'd
[50:00] be fishermen. Amen. So, they were
[50:02] positionally placed in the land. Amen.
[50:04] and they had to do what they were placed
[50:06] to do.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; For the benefit of the whole nation.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Bam's referring to.
[50:14] Now, let's go over here to uh if you
[50:16] would with me to First Corinthians.
[50:19] Keep your place in Ephesians. We're
[50:21] going to come back to Ephesians, but
[50:22] let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[50:31] verse 4.
[50:36] 1 Corinthians 12:4. Now there are
[50:39] diversities of gifts but the same
[50:41] spirit. There are differences of
[50:43] administration but the same Lord. There
[50:45] are diversities of operations but it is
[50:48] the same God which workketh all in all.
[50:50] I want to just pause for a moment. I
[50:51] don't want to go too fast. There's a
[50:54] diversity of gifts
[50:56] &gt;&gt; but the same spirit.
[50:58] There are difference of administrations
[51:00] but the same Lord.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And there are diversity of operations
[51:06] but the same God which workketh all in
[51:08] all.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; So there's many gifts
[51:12] but there's many ways they can be
[51:14] administered.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; And there's many ways they can operate.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; So they don't all have to look the same.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:23] You start running the calculations on a
[51:25] variety of gifts with a variety of
[51:27] administrations with a variety of
[51:29] operations. There's nothing cookie
[51:31] cutter here, friends.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; It's all unique to the way the spirit
[51:35] leads your gift in administration and
[51:39] the way the spirit leads it in
[51:40] operation.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; So, let's not compare ourselves among
[51:44] ourselves. Let's just go the way God
[51:47] leads. Let's just do as God leads us.
[51:49] Amen. Let's continue on.
[51:53] Uh verse 7, but the manifestation of the
[51:56] spirit is given to every man to profit
[51:58] with all. So each one's been given it
[52:00] for everybody else. For to one is given
[52:02] by the spirit the word of wisdom, to
[52:04] another the word of knowledge by the
[52:05] same spirit, to another faith by the
[52:08] same spirit, to another the gifts of
[52:09] healing by the same spirit, to another
[52:12] the working of miracles, to another
[52:13] prophecy, to another discerning of
[52:15] spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[52:17] tongues, to another the interpretation
[52:19] of tongues. But all these workketh that
[52:21] one and self-same spirit, dividing to
[52:24] every man severally as he will.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Who divides it out?
[52:30] &gt;&gt; The spirit.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Not our will, but his will.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go skip over to verse 27.
[52:40] Says between there, he starts talking
[52:41] about the body and how every joint's not
[52:43] the same and not everything is an eye,
[52:44] not everything's a hand, but
[52:46] everything's needed. Then he goes to
[52:47] verse 27. He says, "Now ye are the body
[52:50] of Christ and members in particular. And
[52:52] God has set some in the church, first
[52:54] apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly
[52:56] teachers, after that miracles, then
[52:58] gifts of healing, helps, governments,
[53:01] diversities of tongues." I I love this
[53:03] list.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's interesting about this list
[53:06] when we've been looking at all this when
[53:08] we start when when many times when the
[53:10] gifts of the spirit are preached on only
[53:12] three or four are emphasized
[53:16] &gt;&gt; you know tongues and interpretation and
[53:18] miracles and things like that but but
[53:20] look what he's listing here he's listing
[53:22] wisdom he's listing knowledge
[53:23] discernment of spirit he he he he's
[53:26] listing faith now he comes down here and
[53:28] he's saying some are placed into the
[53:30] church amen uh uh gifts of healing helps
[53:34] Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Helps.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Has you ever heard anybody preach a
[53:38] sermon on helps in the church?
[53:40] &gt;&gt; As gifts of the spirit.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you ever heard anybody
[53:44] getting really fired up talking about
[53:46] what we need to gifts of the spirit? We
[53:47] need the gifts operating in the spirit.
[53:48] Why aren't the gifts operating in the
[53:50] spirit? And and nobody says what we need
[53:52] in here are some helps. We don't have
[53:53] enough helps. I got to see helps in the
[53:55] church.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You realize if we want the gifts
[54:00] of the spirit, we want all the gifts of
[54:02] the spirit. We want everything. We don't
[54:03] want anything excluded because we need
[54:05] to we need joints that supply. We need
[54:08] everything working together. We got to
[54:10] have the spirit working in every one of
[54:11] us. Brother Benham said God put the
[54:14] gifts in the spirit. He never took them
[54:15] out. They're supposed to be there
[54:16] operating in the church.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't get discouraged if if
[54:21] your gift isn't one of those that's
[54:23] visible and that manifest in the
[54:25] service. Amen. There's gifts of the
[54:26] spirit that's given for all.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; And it can be helps. Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Governments, diversities of tongues, are
[54:35] all apostles, are all prophets, are all
[54:38] teachers, are all workers of I get these
[54:41] are hypothetical, right? You understand
[54:43] the answer to all these is no.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Can you pass the test?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are
[54:49] all teachers? Are all workers of a
[54:50] miracle? Have all the gifts of healing?
[54:52] Do all speak with tongues? Do all
[54:53] interpret? But covet earnestly the best
[54:56] gifts and yet show unto you a more
[54:58] excellent way. And he's going to show
[54:59] that when he gets down into love in the
[55:01] next chapter, but we're not going there
[55:03] today. Amen. We're moving on.
[55:07] He says, "Ephraim
[55:10] don't want to stay." One of them go over
[55:12] here and we find Manasseh just over here
[55:14] say, "Oh my, the Lord's given me a good
[55:16] corn field." Then here comes over here.
[55:18] Gad said, "Well, now now wait a minute."
[55:20] Said, "I'm supposed to raise oats, but
[55:22] I'm going to get corn, too." Hallelujah.
[55:24] See, you ain't got nothing to do with
[55:26] corn. Get oats. Oats is your part to
[55:28] raise. You ain't supposed to herd sheep
[55:30] when you're supposed to herd cattle. God
[55:32] wants to place the church. But every one
[55:34] of them wants to do the same thing.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Diversity of gifts.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Diversity administrations. Amen. And
[55:43] operations divided severally as the
[55:46] spirit will.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; I say, God, help me to be whatever you
[55:50] want me to be.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] Amen.
[55:58] Where am I?
[56:01] Well, let's just read on. Let's see
[56:02] where we are.
[56:05] He says, "Now, the book of Ephesians, as
[56:07] I was just saying,
[56:11] no, no, no, no, no." Oh, yeah. I know
[56:14] where I'm at. Don't read.
[56:18] I went too far, too fast. I want to turn
[56:21] to the book of Joshua and read something
[56:23] real quick and then come right back to
[56:25] Ephesians 5. So, if there's a way you
[56:26] can save your spot, please do. So, I
[56:29] want to read uh to Joshua. Let's go to
[56:31] Joshua 23
[56:34] cuz remember we're looking at Ephesians
[56:37] parallels Joshua.
[56:42] And let's go to Joshua 23.
[56:46] I'm going to begin reading at verse two.
[56:50] And Joshua called for all Israel, and
[56:52] for the elders, and for their heads, and
[56:54] for their judges, and for their
[56:55] officers, and said unto them, I am old
[56:58] and stricken in age. And ye have seen
[57:01] all that the Lord your God hath done
[57:02] unto all these nations because of you.
[57:04] For the Lord your God is he that hath
[57:06] fought for you. Behold, I have divided
[57:09] unto you uh by lot these nations that
[57:12] remain to be an inheritance for your
[57:14] tribes from Jordan, with all the nations
[57:16] that I have cut off, even unto the great
[57:18] sea westward. And the Lord your God, he
[57:21] shall expel them from before you, and
[57:23] drive them from out of your sight, and
[57:25] ye shall possess their land, as the Lord
[57:27] your God hath promised unto you. But ye
[57:30] therefore be ye therefore very
[57:32] courageous to keep and to do all that is
[57:35] written in the book of the law of Moses,
[57:37] that you turn not aside there there from
[57:40] to the right hand or to the left, that
[57:42] you come not among these nations, these
[57:44] that remain among you, neither make
[57:46] mention of the name of their God, nor
[57:48] cause to swear by them, neither serve
[57:50] them, nor bow yourself unto them. But
[57:53] cleave unto the Lord your God as you
[57:55] have done unto this day. For the Lord
[57:57] hath driven you, driven out from before
[57:59] you great nations and strong. But as for
[58:01] you, no man has been able to stand
[58:03] before you unto this day. One man of you
[58:06] shall chase a thousand for the Lord your
[58:07] God. He it is that fightth for you, as
[58:10] he hath promised you. Take good heed,
[58:12] therefore unto yourselves, that you love
[58:14] the Lord your God. He's about ready to
[58:17] part from them and he's giving them some
[58:19] final instructions here in in chapter 23
[58:22] and 24. And he's and he's and he's
[58:24] laying out what God has done for you.
[58:26] God has done this for you. God has
[58:29] brought you into this land. God has
[58:30] given it to you. And in verse in chapter
[58:32] 24, he says, "God gave you a land to
[58:34] inhabit that you didn't build. Olive
[58:38] olive vineyards that you didn't plant."
[58:39] Amen. Uh uh uh wine vineyards or grape
[58:42] vineyards that you didn't plant. Houses
[58:44] that you didn't build. God did that for
[58:46] you. That's grace.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; But make sure that you keep going and
[58:52] you stay true to him and stay separated
[58:54] from the world and don't take the gods
[58:56] that are around you and don't go back to
[58:58] the former gods from your father. And
[59:00] he's instructing him all this in chapter
[59:02] 23 and 24. He's telling him, "God did
[59:04] this for you. God brought you out. God
[59:07] brought you in. God gave you the land.
[59:08] God drove out the inhabitants. Now you
[59:10] go possess the rest of the land, and God
[59:12] will drive them out from you. God is the
[59:14] one who fights for you. Not one man
[59:16] shall stand before you. 10 a thousand
[59:19] shall flee before one man. They can't
[59:21] stand before you because God's for you.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "But you better stay
[59:27] with God."
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Don't go back to the old ways. Don't go
[59:32] back to the gods of these other nations.
[59:35] Don't go back to your former gods. Amen.
[59:37] That that they served over the other
[59:39] side of the flood. Talking about Abraham
[59:41] and Tara. Amen. when they were idol
[59:43] worshippers
[59:44] &gt;&gt; said don't do that stay true to God and
[59:47] love God
[59:49] &gt;&gt; man remember Joshua par parallels
[59:51] Ephesians let's go to Ephesians now
[59:55] Ephesians chapter 5
[1:00:01] Paul comes to Ephesians 5 you remember
[1:00:04] the first three chapters is grace the
[1:00:07] next three chapters is works
[1:00:09] instructions
[1:00:11] and he says in chapter 5:1, "Be
[1:00:13] therefore followers of God as dear
[1:00:14] children, and walk in love as Christ
[1:00:17] also hath loved us, and hath given
[1:00:19] himself for us, an offering and a
[1:00:21] sacrifice uh to God for a sweet smelling
[1:00:24] savior." But fornication, and all
[1:00:27] cleanness, and covetousness, let it not
[1:00:28] be once named among you, has become a
[1:00:31] saint. Neither filthiness, nor foolish
[1:00:34] talking, nor jesting, which are not
[1:00:35] convenient, but rather giving of thanks.
[1:00:38] For this you know that no whoreonger, no
[1:00:40] unclean person, no covetous man who is
[1:00:42] an idoltor have any inheritance in the
[1:00:45] kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man
[1:00:48] deceive you with vain words. For because
[1:00:50] of these things cometh the wrath of God
[1:00:52] upon the children of disobedience. Be na
[1:00:54] ye therefore partakers with them. For ye
[1:00:57] were sometimes darkness, but now are you
[1:00:59] light in the Lord. Walk as children of
[1:01:01] light. For the fruit of the spirit is in
[1:01:03] all goodness and righteousness and
[1:01:05] truth, proving what is acceptable unto
[1:01:07] the Lord. And have no fellowship with
[1:01:09] the unfruitful works of darkness, but
[1:01:11] rather reprove them. For it is a shame
[1:01:13] even to speak of those things which are
[1:01:15] done of them in secret. But all things
[1:01:17] that are reproved are made manifest by
[1:01:19] the light. For whatsoever doeth make
[1:01:21] manifest is light. That wherefore he
[1:01:24] saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and
[1:01:26] arise the dead, and arise from the dead,
[1:01:28] and Christ shall give thee light. See
[1:01:31] then that thou walk circumspectly, not
[1:01:33] as fools, but as wise, redeeming the
[1:01:35] time, because the days are evil.
[1:01:37] Wherefore be ye not unwise, but
[1:01:39] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:01:42] is. And be not drunk with wine where it
[1:01:44] is excellence, but be filled with the
[1:01:46] spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms
[1:01:48] and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
[1:01:51] and making melody in your heart to the
[1:01:52] Lord, giving thanks always for all
[1:01:55] things unto God and the father in the
[1:01:57] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. You see
[1:02:00] the parallel between Joshua when they
[1:02:02] were in the land telling them this is
[1:02:04] what God did for you. Now do this.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; And he comes and he tells them the same
[1:02:09] thing through the book of Ephesians.
[1:02:11] This is what God did for you. You're
[1:02:12] predestinated this. God did this before
[1:02:14] the foundation of the world by his
[1:02:16] grace, by his own purpose. You've been
[1:02:18] called. Amen. You're saved by grace.
[1:02:20] You've been called unto good works. All
[1:02:21] of these things he lays out. He said,
[1:02:23] "God did all of that. Now you do this."
[1:02:25] Amen. Keep yourselves separated from the
[1:02:27] world. Don't partake of all of these
[1:02:29] things that are around you. Stay
[1:02:30] consecrated, sanctified, separated for
[1:02:33] the purpose that God called you for.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Ephesians parallels Joshua.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] And
[1:02:44] as we move on, I want to take this last
[1:02:46] little part here
[1:02:48] because we know where did they fail?
[1:02:52] Where did Joshua fail? They were taking
[1:02:54] the land, but before they could fully
[1:02:56] possess it, before they had all of the
[1:02:57] inheritance under their control, they
[1:03:00] started to slip up by making covenants
[1:03:03] and agreements and putting nations under
[1:03:05] tribute. And then their sins, they
[1:03:07] started getting attracted to. And
[1:03:08] everything Joshua told them not to do,
[1:03:10] they started to do. And they fell before
[1:03:13] they completed their entire purpose.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we know the first church did
[1:03:20] the same thing. Paul told him, "God has
[1:03:22] brought you out with a mighty hand. God
[1:03:24] has delivered you from darkness, from
[1:03:26] the realm of darkness. God has brought
[1:03:28] you unto himself. He's birthed you into
[1:03:30] himself. Amen. By the blood of Jesus
[1:03:33] Christ, by the spirit of God, he's
[1:03:34] brought you into your inheritance. He's
[1:03:36] brought you into all of these places.
[1:03:38] Now stay here.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Don't go back to the former lust. Don't
[1:03:42] go back to the things of the world.
[1:03:44] Don't go back to the things that
[1:03:46] religious systems are doing. Don't do
[1:03:47] that." But the church failed. They went
[1:03:49] right back to it. That's right.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we see Ephesians parallels
[1:03:55] Joshua.
[1:03:56] But here
[1:03:58] something Brother BM says that I'd like
[1:04:00] to conclude on. He says, "Now the book
[1:04:02] of Ephesians, as I was just saying, to
[1:04:05] my opinion, is one of the greatest books
[1:04:06] of the New Testament. It leaves us on
[1:04:09] where Calvinism runs out on a limb and
[1:04:10] Armenianism runs out on the other limb,
[1:04:13] but the book of Ephesians draws it
[1:04:15] together and positionally places the
[1:04:17] church." Now, I've typed it with Joshua.
[1:04:19] If you notice, Israel was brought up out
[1:04:22] of Egypt. And there's three stages of
[1:04:24] their journey. One stage was leaving
[1:04:26] Egypt. The next stage was the
[1:04:28] wilderness. And the next stage was
[1:04:30] Canaan. Now, Canaan does not represent
[1:04:32] the age of the millennium. It only
[1:04:34] represents the age of the overcomer, the
[1:04:36] dispensation of overcoming. Because in
[1:04:38] Canaan, they killed and burnt and took
[1:04:41] cities.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; This is important because what did he
[1:04:44] type moving into the promised land for
[1:04:45] us in Ephesians? Going into the Holy
[1:04:47] Ghost, baptism. Amen. And so the Holy
[1:04:50] Ghost baptism isn't yet millennium.
[1:04:52] Amen. Because he's showing there was
[1:04:53] still fighting going on. There was still
[1:04:55] things that were happening.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; He says it again this way. In this
[1:04:59] promised land, everything belongs to us
[1:05:01] in the promised land. See, brother
[1:05:03] Collins, see everything in the promised
[1:05:05] land. When Israel crossed over this
[1:05:07] Jordan into the promised land, fought
[1:05:09] down everything. Now remember, in this
[1:05:11] promised land, that don't mean that
[1:05:13] you're immune from sickness. That don't
[1:05:15] mean that you're immune from troubles.
[1:05:17] But it does spell this. Oh, let this
[1:05:18] sink deep. It says this that it's yours.
[1:05:21] Just rise and take it.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; When they crossed over to their
[1:05:26] inheritance, it was a promise that was
[1:05:28] given to them that was given to their
[1:05:30] father Abraham. They were included in
[1:05:32] the promise by an unconditional covenant
[1:05:34] of grace. God says, "I will do this."
[1:05:38] Amen. And God, according to his covenant
[1:05:40] of grace, did it. He brought them out
[1:05:42] with a mighty hand, delivered them from
[1:05:44] bondage, slavery, darkness, and death,
[1:05:46] and brought them back to life. and
[1:05:48] brought them back into the promise that
[1:05:49] he gave them and get the boundaries,
[1:05:51] divided them into the land, promised his
[1:05:54] power, amen, to help them overcome every
[1:05:56] enemy if they would just keep fighting
[1:05:58] and stay separated.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And the same thing happened, amen, to
[1:06:04] the church. It's happened to us. Amen.
[1:06:06] God brought us out with a mighty hand.
[1:06:08] He delivered us from darkness. He
[1:06:10] brought us from dead, the deadness of
[1:06:12] sin and darkness of unbelief and
[1:06:14] resurrected us to life and brought us in
[1:06:16] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into
[1:06:18] his promise. Amen. But in that promise,
[1:06:21] there's troubles. There's difficulties
[1:06:22] all around. You're not immune from
[1:06:24] sickness. You're not immune from
[1:06:25] fighting. But it does tell you this.
[1:06:27] This is your promise. Take it.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; This is what he promised to you. his own
[1:06:33] life to give you the power to conquer
[1:06:35] every enemy, to overcome every obstacle.
[1:06:38] No matter what faces you, he's already
[1:06:40] promised his promise inside of you to
[1:06:43] help us overcome.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; But we got to stay separated. We got to
[1:06:53] stay
[1:06:55] separated from the world, separated from
[1:06:57] the religions of the world, stay
[1:06:59] consecrated to God, stay in love with
[1:07:01] him.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] Amen. This is where the first church
[1:07:05] failed, but this one, listen, this
[1:07:07] bride's not going to fail.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; I say it many times, not because she's
[1:07:12] better, smarter, uh not not because
[1:07:14] she's better educated, none of that.
[1:07:16] Because he's predestinated her not to
[1:07:18] fail.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. This church by the power of the
[1:07:22] Holy Ghost is going to stay separated.
[1:07:24] She's going to stay separate from the
[1:07:26] world, separate from religion, separate
[1:07:28] from man ideas. She's going to cling to
[1:07:30] the Lord. She's going to love him,
[1:07:31] separate from everything else, and
[1:07:33] overcome and take all the promises. If
[1:07:36] it's promised in the word, if it's in
[1:07:38] the New Testament, it's for you.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Rise and take it. Possess the land.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; I'd like to go to one more scripture if
[1:07:50] you'll go with me to Ephesians chapter
[1:07:54] 6.
[1:07:57] Praise the Lord. The blessings of heaven
[1:07:59] are pouring upon it.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:09] We could try to spiritualize it and make
[1:08:10] something up,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; but praise God. Amen.
[1:08:14] The blessings of God are falling.
[1:08:18] Amen. Now, let's look at Ephesians 6:10.
[1:08:22] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[1:08:25] Lord and the power of his might.
[1:08:28] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:08:30] may be able to stand against the ws of
[1:08:32] the devil. For we wrestle not against
[1:08:35] flesh and blood, but against
[1:08:36] principalities, against powers, against
[1:08:38] the rulers of the darkness of this
[1:08:40] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:08:42] high places.
[1:08:44] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:08:46] of God, that you may be able to stand in
[1:08:48] the evil day. And having done all,
[1:08:51] having done all to stand. Stand
[1:08:53] therefore, having your loins girth about
[1:08:55] with truth, and having on the
[1:08:57] breastplate of righteousness, your feet
[1:08:59] shaw with the preparation of the gospel
[1:09:01] of peace. Above all, taking the shield
[1:09:04] of faith, wherewith you shall be able to
[1:09:06] quench all the fiery darts of the
[1:09:07] wicked. Take the helmet of salvation and
[1:09:09] the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:09:11] word of God. Praying always with all
[1:09:13] supplication and uh with prayer and
[1:09:16] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:09:18] there unto with all perseverance and
[1:09:20] supplication for all saints. This is the
[1:09:23] last instructions that Paul gives to the
[1:09:26] church in Ephesians. Then he goes on and
[1:09:28] asks for prayer for him and brings some
[1:09:30] greetings. But the last instruction that
[1:09:33] he says is be strong.
[1:09:37] Be strong in the Lord and the power of
[1:09:39] his might.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; He gives them instructions. Be strong.
[1:09:43] And it's almost like when God instructs
[1:09:45] Joshua, be courageous and be not afraid.
[1:09:48] And Joshua instructs the people, be
[1:09:49] courageous, be not afraid. Go take the
[1:09:51] inheritance.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; And now the last instructions. He's
[1:09:54] given us what God did for us. We've
[1:09:56] given us who we are in grace. What we
[1:09:58] are by predestination as children of
[1:10:01] God. Predestinated to adoption. Amen.
[1:10:03] Saved by uh grace through faith. He
[1:10:05] gives us all of that. Then he gives an
[1:10:07] instruction for living a separated clean
[1:10:09] life to be useful for the kingdom of
[1:10:11] God. And then he finishes with this. Be
[1:10:14] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:10:15] his might. Put on the whole armor of God
[1:10:19] that you may be able to stand against
[1:10:20] the ws of the devil. Because we're not
[1:10:22] wrestling with flesh and blood. He's
[1:10:24] saying, listen, I'm leaving you with
[1:10:26] this. You're headed for a spiritual
[1:10:28] battle. You're going to fight every day
[1:10:31] of your life to inherit the fullness of
[1:10:33] this promise.
[1:10:35] doesn't mean you've stepped into the
[1:10:36] millennium yet. There's still fighting.
[1:10:38] There's still war going on. There's
[1:10:40] still things to conquer. There's still
[1:10:41] places to overcome in our own lives.
[1:10:44] Amen. There's still promises that we
[1:10:45] want to see manifest amongst us in our
[1:10:48] own lives. Amen. But in order to do
[1:10:49] that, you're going to have to take on
[1:10:51] the mentality of a warrior and not get
[1:10:53] lazy because that's what happened to
[1:10:55] Israel. Israel stopped fighting and
[1:10:57] started farming. Amen. They stop
[1:10:59] fighting and move to the pleasures of
[1:11:01] their inheritance and stop pressing for
[1:11:04] the fullness of the inheritance.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; So what does it denote? He leaves them
[1:11:09] with these instructions. Get your armor
[1:11:12] on.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Put your shoes on. Strap your belt on.
[1:11:16] Get your sword in your hand. And be
[1:11:18] praying all the time. Amen. Because this
[1:11:20] is not a physical thing. This not a
[1:11:22] physical inheritance. It's a spiritual
[1:11:24] inheritance. It's a promise that he's
[1:11:26] given us. And what is the bride? She's
[1:11:28] the New Testament. That's all. So,
[1:11:30] whatever is in this New Testament is for
[1:11:32] us. Every promise is given to us by the
[1:11:35] Holy Ghost, by the death and
[1:11:37] resurrection of Jesus Christ. His blood
[1:11:39] purchased for us everything. His his his
[1:11:42] life returned to us to give us the power
[1:11:44] to possess all. Amen. Let's keep moving
[1:11:47] forward. Be a soldier. Don't be lazy.
[1:11:50] Don't start settling down and
[1:11:52] establishing ourselves and making wine
[1:11:54] and having feast. Let's keep moving
[1:11:56] forward. and let let's move until we get
[1:11:58] the fullness of the inheritance in our
[1:12:01] possession.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; And what's the fullness of the
[1:12:03] inheritance? A new body.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be happy till I get a
[1:12:09] new body. Why? Cuz it's my promise for
[1:12:12] this age. And I'm not going to stop
[1:12:14] pressing. I'm not going to start taking
[1:12:16] my inheritance and living in my
[1:12:19] inheritance. Amen. and staying separated
[1:12:21] from the world and staying consecrated
[1:12:23] to God and loving him above all and
[1:12:26] keeping my mind and my heart and my body
[1:12:28] focused on him and keep myself under
[1:12:30] preparation of battle all the time
[1:12:32] because this inheritance in order to
[1:12:35] fully possess it is going to require a
[1:12:37] fight.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; But praise God, he equipped us for the
[1:12:42] fight. Remember, Ephesians parallels
[1:12:44] Joshua. And Joshua says, "Go take the
[1:12:47] land. You fight. I'll be with you.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; I'll fight for you. I'll drive them out.
[1:12:54] You go fight."
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; It wasn't sitting back on their heels
[1:12:59] twiddling their thumbs while God drove
[1:13:01] them out. No. God says, "I'll fight for
[1:13:03] you when you're fighting.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; I'll drive them out when you're driving
[1:13:06] them out." Amen. And God will do the
[1:13:09] same thing for you and I, friends, when
[1:13:10] we're pushing against the devil. He'll
[1:13:12] push the devil out of the way. Amen.
[1:13:14] When we're taking the sword of the
[1:13:15] spirit with a strong hand of faith and
[1:13:17] driving through the heart of the enemy,
[1:13:19] he'll get behind us by the power of the
[1:13:20] Holy Ghost and push that sword forward.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; But we got to put on the full armor and
[1:13:28] be a warrior in this battle because
[1:13:31] Ephesians parallels Joshua.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Does that is that more clear now
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; than it was? I love these Bible studies.
[1:13:40] My goodness,
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham is so wonderful. The
[1:13:44] gift that God put in him, the word that
[1:13:45] God brought through him.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; There's little nuggets that were dropped
[1:13:49] for us, friends, we begin to understand
[1:13:51] where we are and the picture and what
[1:13:54] went wrong, but what it takes what it
[1:13:57] takes in this hour to fully possess the
[1:14:00] promise.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him?
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; I'm so excited to know that we've
[1:14:07] crossed Jordan.
[1:14:09] We're taking the land. He brought us
[1:14:10] back to our inheritance
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; and it's to be fully possessed
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; for all of it. For all of it. Praise
[1:14:19] God. That's all that I want to share on
[1:14:21] that subject, but I've got one more
[1:14:22] small thing that I want to share with
[1:14:24] you. Uh if you can bear with me for just
[1:14:26] another moment. I got done early, so I
[1:14:28] had a few more minutes.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a a little bit of
[1:14:33] confusion over a sermon that was
[1:14:34] preached here just a little bit ago and
[1:14:36] it was when brother Alistister was here
[1:14:38] and he preached on the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:40] the Holy Ghost and it left a question in
[1:14:43] some people's mind. So I've been
[1:14:44] fielding a few questions from within the
[1:14:46] assembly and from outside of the
[1:14:48] assembly. So I just wanted to take a
[1:14:50] minute to clear up what I thought was a
[1:14:52] little bit of a confusing point. And uh
[1:14:54] it took me a little while to get to this
[1:14:56] because I wanted to wait till I could
[1:14:57] talk to brother Alistister before I I I
[1:15:00] brought this clarification because I
[1:15:02] wanted him to know first. I didn't want
[1:15:03] to just get up and say something and him
[1:15:05] hear about it. Uh so I had to wait till
[1:15:08] he got home and I've been able to talk
[1:15:09] to him now twice and we're at we have a
[1:15:11] very good understanding. we've talked um
[1:15:14] but
[1:15:15] actually when I talked to him about uh
[1:15:18] when he started in the sermon talking
[1:15:20] about the the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[1:15:22] Ghost and he started separating them as
[1:15:25] two different things representing two
[1:15:26] different things through the Bible and
[1:15:27] that the King James translators had a
[1:15:30] different purpose in using them. I found
[1:15:32] it for myself a little bit confusing. I
[1:15:34] was having a hard time. I understood
[1:15:35] what he was saying but I I had a hard
[1:15:37] time piecing that together. And then but
[1:15:39] the rest of the sermon I absolutely
[1:15:41] loved when he started showing us that
[1:15:43] the real purpose for what he was
[1:15:44] ministering was to show us that there's
[1:15:46] a difference with the Holy Ghost
[1:15:48] bringing gifts and actions and acting
[1:15:50] through a people and the person of the
[1:15:51] Holy Ghost indwelling the soul.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Those were two very different things.
[1:15:55] He's trying to show that he was trying
[1:15:56] to show teach the lesson on Holy Spirit,
[1:15:59] Holy Ghost separating them and the New
[1:16:01] Testament to show us that point.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; So that point is exactly what brother
[1:16:07] Brandham taught. Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; But the the way he got there I thought
[1:16:11] was a little confusing and it's had some
[1:16:12] confusion uh for the people. And there's
[1:16:16] a quote where brother Brandham answers
[1:16:18] this question. So I'm just going to show
[1:16:19] it to you. He said, you know, brother
[1:16:21] told us that he went down this study
[1:16:23] because of a question that somebody
[1:16:24] asked him about the difference between
[1:16:27] the Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost. But
[1:16:28] brother Brandham fielded that same
[1:16:30] question and he said it this way. He
[1:16:34] said, here's the question in bold. We
[1:16:36] know that the blessed holy spirit is not
[1:16:37] given to vain repetition in laying out
[1:16:39] the holy scriptures. So please tell me
[1:16:42] why the word holy spirit is used
[1:16:44] sometimes and the word holy ghost is
[1:16:46] used some other times. I know that there
[1:16:48] is a valid reason for this and I would
[1:16:50] like to know why. Brother Brenham's
[1:16:53] answer it is the self-same word. A
[1:16:55] spirit and a ghost is the very same
[1:16:57] thing. A ghost or a spirit it doesn't
[1:16:59] matter. They're just the same.
[1:17:01] Self-same.
[1:17:02] So I think this is what was a little bit
[1:17:04] confusing because this is brother
[1:17:06] Brandham's answer to that question is
[1:17:08] that there is no difference between
[1:17:10] ghost or spirit. They're the self-same.
[1:17:12] And the question was how they're used in
[1:17:14] the New Testament. One times it's uh uh
[1:17:17] holy spirit, the other times holy ghost.
[1:17:20] And brother Brandham says it's no
[1:17:22] difference. And so for me I like staying
[1:17:25] with what the prophet said. I think it's
[1:17:27] simple uh and not to complicate it. And
[1:17:30] so that's what I wanted to bring to you
[1:17:32] because I don't want anybody reading
[1:17:34] their Bibles and going through and
[1:17:36] saying,"Well, now is this what did
[1:17:37] Alistair say? What is this? Holy Spirit,
[1:17:39] Holy Ghost." I think Brother Brandham
[1:17:41] just made it super simple.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Self, same word, a spirit, a ghost is
[1:17:45] very same thing. Ghost or spirit doesn't
[1:17:47] matter. They're just the same self.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Uh the the same same self. So I hope
[1:17:52] that makes it clear for everybody who
[1:17:54] might have been a little confused with
[1:17:56] that.
[1:17:57] And then also in the Bible, I'm just
[1:17:59] going to show a couple uh uh uh
[1:18:02] scriptures in 2 Peter 1:21. I want to
[1:18:05] show what Brother Benham said. For the
[1:18:07] prophecy came not in old time by the
[1:18:08] will of men, but by the holy men of God
[1:18:10] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[1:18:12] Ghost. And so here we have Holy Ghost,
[1:18:15] which is uh only used in the New
[1:18:16] Testament, but it's referring back to an
[1:18:18] act of the spirit of God in the Old
[1:18:20] Testament. So it's the same spirit
[1:18:22] that's working. It's just working in
[1:18:24] different manifestation. And that's
[1:18:26] really what Alistister was trying to
[1:18:27] show that the Holy Ghost works in
[1:18:29] conjunction with man by different
[1:18:30] manifestations in different ages.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And I concur with that. I thought the
[1:18:35] message was sound.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; But this ghost, the word ghost is the
[1:18:40] Greek word numa. It's translated spirit
[1:18:43] 111 times and it's translated holy
[1:18:45] ghost. It's not actually translated holy
[1:18:46] ghost. It's only translated ghost. Holy
[1:18:48] is a different word 89 times. So it's
[1:18:51] translated both spirit and ghost. And
[1:18:54] this is one of those examples of spirit.
[1:18:56] He therefore that despiseth despiseth
[1:18:58] not man but God who hath also given unto
[1:19:01] us his holy spirit. This word spirit is
[1:19:04] the same word as ghost. That's what
[1:19:06] brother bram said. It's the self-same
[1:19:08] word. There's no difference and it's
[1:19:10] used interchangeably
[1:19:12] uh in the bible. I'll show you another
[1:19:14] place in Acts 2:4. And they were all
[1:19:17] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:19:20] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:19:22] gave them utterance. So the question is
[1:19:24] which spirit gave them utterance? The
[1:19:26] Holy Ghost that they were just filled
[1:19:28] with. So here ghost and spirit is the
[1:19:30] same thing.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; All right. And here I'll do one more
[1:19:36] uh Acts 20
[1:19:38] uh 22. And and now behold, I go bound in
[1:19:42] the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing
[1:19:44] the things that shall befall me there,
[1:19:46] save that the Holy Ghost witnessed in
[1:19:48] every city, saying that bonds and
[1:19:50] afflictions abide me. So how did the
[1:19:52] Holy Ghost witness them in every city?
[1:19:54] Through gifted individuals speaking by
[1:19:56] the Holy Ghost. And we saw that when he
[1:19:59] comes and and there's prophecy over him
[1:20:01] through I think it's Agabus who starts
[1:20:03] to tell him that he'll be bound when he
[1:20:05] goes into Jerusalem. So he's telling
[1:20:07] them that the Holy Ghost witnesses in
[1:20:09] every city saying the bonds and
[1:20:11] afflictions abide in me. And then in
[1:20:13] Acts 21 says, "And finding disciples, we
[1:20:16] tried there seven days who said to Paul,
[1:20:20] who spoke to Paul? The disciples who
[1:20:22] said to Paul through the spirit that he
[1:20:25] should not go up to Jerusalem." So here
[1:20:27] it was the spirit speaking through these
[1:20:29] disciples he shouldn't go. But before he
[1:20:31] said it was the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; So you see they're interchangeable.
[1:20:35] Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Now, in defense of of Brother Alistar,
[1:20:38] Brother Alistister in his sermon, he
[1:20:40] said, now Brother Brandham uses them
[1:20:42] interchangeably. They're interchangeable
[1:20:44] in the Bible. They are the same word.
[1:20:45] They're interchangeable. He did say
[1:20:46] that. So, I want I want to make clear he
[1:20:49] did say that. But then when he went on
[1:20:51] into the lengthier description, I was
[1:20:53] afraid that some of that understanding
[1:20:55] got lost. So, Brother Alistister, I
[1:20:58] talked to him and he understands uh
[1:21:00] where the confusion is. And I told him
[1:21:01] that I was going to bring some clarity,
[1:21:04] at least to my understanding.
[1:21:06] And he wanted me to make sure that I I
[1:21:09] shared his apology to everybody. He
[1:21:11] never meant to make anything confusing.
[1:21:13] He wanted to apologize. And he also said
[1:21:15] he sure never intended. He he he said,
[1:21:18] "I do not feel like we need to to
[1:21:20] nitpick the Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost
[1:21:22] and pick it apart." That was never his
[1:21:24] purpose. His purpose was to demonstrate
[1:21:26] that the Holy Ghost is the spirit of
[1:21:28] God. The spirit of God is is is God
[1:21:31] working in and through man. And he's
[1:21:33] worked in different ways and
[1:21:35] dispensations over time. But God is
[1:21:37] showing us in this end time that that
[1:21:40] there can be a brother Bam showed this
[1:21:41] in anointing ones at the end time and
[1:21:43] other places that there can be a Holy
[1:21:45] Ghost, the true genuine Holy Ghost of
[1:21:47] God fall on somebody and cause them to
[1:21:50] do the works of the Holy Ghost. But it's
[1:21:52] different than the person of the Holy
[1:21:54] Ghost entering into the soul, the true
[1:21:57] new birth experience. And that was
[1:21:59] absolutely spot-on.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; So I en I enjoyed the sermon. By the
[1:22:04] time it was over, I was right in line
[1:22:06] with him. I enjoyed what he said. I
[1:22:07] enjoyed the conclusion. I enjoyed the
[1:22:09] point. I enjoyed all of that. Brother
[1:22:11] Alistister's a wonderful brother and his
[1:22:13] ministry's been a big help to me.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And we love him and and we we enjoy his
[1:22:17] ministry. We have confidence in the
[1:22:19] brother. I just I didn't want that. I
[1:22:21] didn't want anybody to read what brother
[1:22:22] Brandham said and get confused. I just
[1:22:25] wanted to share with you from that
[1:22:26] perspective the the way that I see it
[1:22:29] and I think it's clear the way brother
[1:22:31] Brandham shared it also I told I told
[1:22:35] brother Alistister I said the title is
[1:22:37] just a little bit hard you know he says
[1:22:39] well that wasn't supposed to be my title
[1:22:42] I said what he says my title was the
[1:22:44] purposeful life amen he puts his subject
[1:22:46] before his title amen but brother Franco
[1:22:49] didn't know that so he took a subject
[1:22:50] put it up as his title he goes that was
[1:22:52] never supposed to be my title so Franco
[1:22:54] changed changed it. He found out so he
[1:22:56] changed. So it's now it's titled the
[1:22:57] purposeful life. So anyways, God bless
[1:23:00] you. Let's all stand together.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians, if you want to come and
[1:23:06] brother John, if you can make your way
[1:23:07] up.
[1:23:09] Amen.
[1:23:12] Let's bow our heads and pray together.
[1:23:15] Dear heavenly father, we thank you Lord
[1:23:17] for this wonderful day that you've given
[1:23:20] to us. We thank you, God, for your word
[1:23:22] that is so rich and so true. And God, we
[1:23:26] thank you that you sent a prophet in our
[1:23:28] day and vindicated that voice
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; so we knew who to listen to. Lord, we
[1:23:32] knew where to go for you to uncover the
[1:23:35] truths that are laying there for this
[1:23:36] hour.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're so thankful, God, that you
[1:23:40] showed us that Joshua and Ephesians type
[1:23:43] one another. and we can see and learn by
[1:23:46] the example in Joshua and what happened
[1:23:47] in the first church age and learn what
[1:23:50] we're supposed to be doing in this hour.
[1:23:52] God, I pray that you would help us,
[1:23:54] Lord, to be grateful for all that you've
[1:23:56] done for us. That we would look on your
[1:23:58] amazing grace, your predestinated plan,
[1:24:01] your purpose for our lives, and we would
[1:24:03] just rejoice, God, that you did
[1:24:05] something for us we could never have
[1:24:06] done for ourselves. And may we in turn,
[1:24:09] Lord, separate ourselves from every
[1:24:12] other life and everything else in this
[1:24:14] world and everything else all around us
[1:24:16] and dedicate ourselves solely to you.
[1:24:19] And God, help us to put on the full
[1:24:21] armor. Help us, God, to fight against,
[1:24:24] Lord, the ws of the devil, taking on
[1:24:27] this word and placing it upon ourselves
[1:24:29] and each in a fashioned place, Lord, for
[1:24:32] defense. And let us take up the sword
[1:24:34] and push back and fight against the
[1:24:36] enemy. Help us, Lord, to take all the
[1:24:39] land. Lord, where they failed in
[1:24:42] Joshua's day, where the first church
[1:24:45] failed, God, you've predestinated this
[1:24:47] church not to fail, and you sent your
[1:24:49] power down to make sure it would happen.
[1:24:51] Help us to live, Lord, in that
[1:24:53] inheritance. Oh God, we give ourselves
[1:24:56] to you, Aresh, and pray that your power
[1:24:58] would come,
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; to give us overcoming power. God, as we
[1:25:02] fight, would you empower our fight? As
[1:25:04] we press back, would you push with us?
[1:25:06] Would you give us the power to overcome
[1:25:08] every obstacle, every challenge to your
[1:25:10] word that comes in our lives? May we
[1:25:12] take the word and move forward boldly,
[1:25:15] God, when everything comes to challenge
[1:25:17] our walk, to challenge our thinking, to
[1:25:19] challenge our speech, Lord. May we may
[1:25:21] we with your spirit move into the
[1:25:24] inheritance and take all the promise and
[1:25:26] push through every hindrance and
[1:25:28] obstacle that the enemy would set in our
[1:25:30] way. For God, that's what you've called
[1:25:32] us to. You've called us to adoption.
[1:25:35] You've called us to our position. You've
[1:25:36] called us to our place. And this is the
[1:25:38] hour not just of personal adoption and
[1:25:41] placing. This is the hour you want to
[1:25:43] place your bride, Lord, in her full
[1:25:45] glory, coming to full maturity with the
[1:25:47] headship, united with the headship of
[1:25:49] Christ. You want her to come to her
[1:25:51] position. And Lord, for that to happen,
[1:25:54] we each one have to stay in ours. Help
[1:25:57] us, God, to stay in ours. We love you,
[1:26:00] Lord Jesus. We ask for your blessings
[1:26:02] upon us. Guide us, Lord, by your word.
[1:26:05] Direct us, Lord, by your truth. Help us
[1:26:08] to stay sensitive to your spirit and
[1:26:10] pliable in your hands that you might use
[1:26:13] us any way that you wish. We love you
[1:26:15] and we ask your blessings upon this
[1:26:18] service, upon our lives. And as we go
[1:26:20] from here, may you help us, Lord, finish
[1:26:23] the race that is set before us. We ask
[1:26:26] for your blessing over all this in Jesus
[1:26:28] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:26:32] Amen.
[1:26:34] Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me
[1:26:47] true.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; For there's a race that I must run.
[1:26:53] There are victories to be won. Give me
[1:26:58] power every hour to be true.
[1:27:04] Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me
[1:27:09] true.
[1:27:12] Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me
[1:27:17] true.
[1:27:20] Oh, there's a race that I must run.
[1:27:24] There are victories to be won. Give me
[1:27:29] power every hour to be true.
[1:27:35] Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me
[1:27:40] true.
[1:27:43] Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me
[1:27:48] true.
[1:27:51] Oh, there's a race that I must run.
[1:27:55] There are victories to be won. Give me
