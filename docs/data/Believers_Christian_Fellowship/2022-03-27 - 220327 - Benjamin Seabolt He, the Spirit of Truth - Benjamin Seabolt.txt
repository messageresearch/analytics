========================================

oh [Music] we [Music] we work and found [Music] is [Music] [Music] and [Music] me [Music] amen as our brother ben comes this morning let's just sing this [Music] we want to see jesus [Music] and say that we [Music] oh [Music] [Music] one more time oh [Music] reach out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he wants you [Music] praise the lord let's pray together precious lord jesus we just thank you for this opportunity that you've given us to once again gathering around you lord father and as we're just singing that you would give us eyes to see and ears to hear you father but we stand before you today such a privileged people lord that you have come and you have told us what to be looking for to see you father and that you've sent the prophet across the scene to tell us that we aren't searching for a man walking around with nail scars and a crown on his head father but we are looking for the word made manifest and that is christ so father we are grateful for that revelation that we're not stumbling in darkness or that we're not wandering to and fro seeking something that we don't know what it is lord but that we can truly seek you because we know what we're looking for lord may we never take that for granted that we can recognize the form that you have come in in this age lord i pray now that you would just come that you would anoint both speaker and hear that you would just have the preeminence here father and that you would come and do what no man can do lord and to take the book and to loose the seals father to take the bread and to break it for your children lord we just commit ourselves to you lord in the name of the lord jesus christ and the bride says amen god bless you if you have your bibles we'll go to the gospel of john chapter 16. the gospel of john chapter 16. trust everybody is ready to have church this morning you know the bride is a very peculiar type of people they're really the only ones that can have church because church means called out ones and you have to be a little bit different to want to come to a service every week or maybe twice a week to get called out you know that don't fly in the low to see and age they don't want to be called out about anything they would get their feelings hurt they would get a complex you would be considered hate speech possibly so the bride is a very select group of people that can actually have church and be called out and be happy about it be happy that you're called out and your sins are made known and you can repent and line up with the word of god so we're a very unusual type of people let's read here beginning in verse 12 john 16 and verse 12. jesus speaking says i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you unto all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you god bless you as you would have your seats and the topic that i want to speak on this morning is he the spirit of truth and i would i would think we would all agree as we're in the closing moments of time and anybody that's been around i won't even say the message but i will say the religious world foreign any type of time of time of all at all has noticed that there is an exorbitant amount of teaching on what we would consider the baptism of the holy spirit or receiving the holy ghost uh whatever term you want to put to it there and i don't intend to preach anything earth shattering here this morning i don't think this is going to be uh you know anything extraordinary new but it's something that i want to go back and take a look at to maybe just bring a little bit of clarity to that topic because this is extremely important this is the new birth we know the the prophet said that the true baptism of the holy spirit was the new birth and he preached that in the token he said that's one of the mysteries that was revealed under those seals so he also said that satan does not care what doctrine you have or how right you are in your doctor and he says if you miss that life you're not going to come up anyhow so i would venture to say by default this is the most important thing to have a proper understanding and a true experience of the true new birth and if that is the most important thing then i don't necessarily think we can over emphasize the truth of that and it's it's one of those things that really my point here this morning is if it's something even carnally speaking if you are seeking something or if you are looking for something you have to know what it is you're looking for or one of two things is going to happen you're never going to find it or you may find it and you still won't know that you have it does that make sense and i find that when it comes to people that are unsettled and people that are unstable that is usually in a spiritual sense that is usually one of the two problems they don't know what they're looking for or they have actually found what they're looking for and they can't recognize it for what it is and because of that there is an unsettledness and you say well that'll never happen if you if you get that holy spirit you're going to know it you're going to be settled you're you're not going to have any issue there but i'll remind you of the interview with sister bruce who was all tore up about it and she had a vindicated prophet tell her you're fine you have it i know you have it i've seen you under discernment you have it but she was all tore up because she didn't recognize it for what it was and the prophet in that interview he made it so simple for her he said sister bruce what did you used to be and what was your desires in the past and she explained them and he says but what is your desires now and what are you now and he asked her the simple question what did that what did that what could change you born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and all the carnal and human hybrid human elements that would be in our being what has the capability to change that other than christ himself it can be self-reformed to to some extent but i'm we're talking and and the prophet and her we're talking about the very innermost being the soul itself the desires is what he was talking about there is nothing that can change that but god so those are the two elements that we run into is not knowing what you're seeking and if you don't know what you're seeking you're probably not going to find it but there is a slight chance that you would but if you still did not know what you were seeking you would not know what you had found and again it's something that will unsettle a person it is something that they will go all their lives have mental conditions be unstable and remember the prophet said that there's teaching that's to come into the church to settle the people and i'm not standing here before you trying to declare myself as a professor you remember there's all types of teaching there's kindergarten teachers so you know that's that's not a self exaltation so just just bear that in mind that's where i want to deal with this this morning is to really teach on this subject because we must know what we have saints we must know what we have because there's going to come a point in time and i would say in the very near future and may currently be going on that we are going to be pressed into a situation that we must know where we stand and we must know what we have when we must know that it will it will stand the test we have to know that we're going to have to know that and i'm not here to declare that we don't have that i just want to reaffirm and have a proper understanding of that so as we look here in john 16 this is jesus himself speaking the fullness of the godhead bodily in flesh speaking and he says i have many things to say to you this is the topic i have many things to say to you in other words he has words to say but you cannot bear them now how be it when he personal pronoun when he the spirit of truth so now he gives a title to a person the spirit of truth is he that will come and tell you the words that i want to tell you right now but cannot he the spirit of truth the spirit of truth is a title to a person and the spirit of truth we know the person is god himself the spirit of god himself but now jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily gives a title that has not been declared yet to the spirit of god himself and that is the spirit of truth he self he defines this spirit that is to come and it is the spirit of truth this is extremely important of all the things that he could attach to this spirit the spirit of praise the spirit of worship the spirit of signs of wonders of healings of miracles anything that he could attach to this promise that is to come he simply says this is the spirit of truth that will come and he attaches that to the person that is to come and we know that person that has to come it was the spirit of jesus it was the spirit of god but so that we would understand and so the disciples would understand what is to come he gives this definition to it when he the spirit of truth is come he person again will guide you unto all truth for he person again shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come verse 14 he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine if you'll do a quick count there there is one two three four five six seven eight times that he says he in two sentences not the sharpest tool in the shed but i think he's wanting us to catch something this is not a thing this is not a thing this is a person and this person has a title that when he comes in this dispensation when this promise is fulfilled he is going to come with the title i am the spirit of truth and remember what jesus said when he started this conversation in verse 12 i have many i'm going to use my verbiage here i have many words of truth that i want to tell you right now but i can't because you can't bear them and then he immediately starts talking about a promise that is to come and a person that is to come and a spirit that is to come and it just so happens that this spirit's title is the spirit of truth what do you think the function of this spirit of truth is going to be it's going to be to be to declare the things that jesus could not declare at that time so i would say that that's probably the most important thing that we want to remember this morning is the holy spirit is by the scripture i don't care what anybody else says i don't care what anybody else says by the scripture the baptism of the holy spirit is defined as receiving the spirit of truth period you do not have to receive the spirit of anything else to receive the baptism baptism of the holy spirit but simply receive the spirit of truth john 4 24 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth john 5. don't try to turn to these i'm going to go through them quickly you can jot them down or just uh go back and catch them later first john 5 verse 6 this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth of all the things that he can say the spirit is he says the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost these three are one again the father the word and the holy ghost these three are one and the verse right before that declared them as the spirit of truth first john 4 6 we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us heareth not what words words that's what he's talking about he heareth the words he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error so we recognize now there is a spirit of truth and a spirit of error and the only way to properly and accurately discern those we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us and he that is not of god heareth not us so if you do not want to hear the truth or you cannot hear the truth you are not of god and you have no capability to be of god that's hard but that's not my saying i'll read you the scripture here in just a second if you have no capability to hear the truth you are not of god and if you are of god you have the capability to hear the truth and that is given of god by his grace but paul or i'm sorry john starts bringing in what i would call scriptural spiritual discernment and he says if you want to discern between the true spirit the two spirits he he defines the two and he says if you want to discern between those two there's only one way to do it you have to have the capability to hear from god ephesians 5 verse 8 for ye were sometimes in darkness but now are ye light in the world walk as children of the light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth so now paul comes and he starts describing the fruit of the spirit and we know this spirit is the spirit of truth so it just so happens that one of its fruits is it is in all goodness and righteousness and truth truth of the word is always tied to the true holy spirit to the true baptism of the holy spirit to the true receiving of the holy ghost to the true new birth you put whatever terminology you want to on it i'm okay with that but if it doesn't come back to receiving the truth for your age it is not the true holy spirit it is not god's spirit it is not he himself and if it is the truth for your age it is none other than he himself john 14 verse 17 even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you notice he does the same thing that he did earlier he he gives the the declaration of this title of this spirit that is to come even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not and immediately goes to the person personal pronoun him it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him i thought he was talking about a spirit of truth why is he keep talking about a person for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you verse 18 i now it gets really specific i will not leave you oh i thought you said he wouldn't leave me i thought you said the spirit of truth wouldn't leave me but now you're saying i won't leave you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you see this is why i say it is so important that we recognize what we're after and if we have got what we're after because if we have really received the baptism of the holy spirit we have received none other than the person of christ jesus himself god himself that should settle you saints that should make us very very stable and how can you be sure because ultimately he reveals himself as the spirit of truth the capability to receive the truth for your age self defaults to you being his bride there is no one else capable to do that we should of all things we should get on our face and thank god every day that he has placed something within us to receive truth not that he just sent truth because he sent truth across the globe seven times but there was a extreme minority that had the capability to receive that truth what a privileged people we are saints what a privileged people we are but we want to recognize that privilege for what it is and we don't want to be seeking something and continue seeking something when we've got what we're seeking and we want to allow that to bring the rest and the peace and the stability and the settledness that it's supposed to john 14 15 verse 26 but when the comforter so now there's another description coming in but when the comforter has come and this is why it's so important that i'm speaking on this this is a scriptural title of the comforter if the comforter has come why should you still be tore up it's in his very title that he's to take that away what good is the comforter coming if you still remain tore up this is a function of the baptism of the holy spirit it's so that you won't be tore up because it's the comforter coming to bring you comfort of your stability and your position in christ the comforter has come whom i will send you from the father even the spirit of truth so now the comforter and the spirit of truth is the exact same thing don't pray for peace and comfort if you're not ready to receive the truth if you're not really sold out completely given over to the truth for your age don't bother praying for peace and comfort you're not going to get it it's impossible because of the same thing but when the comforter has come whom i will send you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the pro father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning you want comfort and peace you want a settledness of stability get that revelation get that revelation that because i have the capability to receive the truth for my age i by default have been with him from the beginning if that don't comfort you if that don't settle you if that does not bring you peace i've got nothing else to offer nothing like if that don't work you're hopeless it's just the facts but if you can gather a proper revelation that because i can receive the truth for my age that means i had to have been with him in the beginning jesus said the reason that you can be taught of me now is because you were taught of the father before those scriptures are not wishy-washy based upon the bad situation you had at work yesterday or the fight that you had or the argument that you had or the ups and down in your emotional realm it's not subject to that you were to bring all of that subject to this revelation because all of those things will change can change and have changed this is something that will not change not on your best day not on your worst day not on your mediocre days this is something that was settled a long long time ago this is the answer to the laodicean problem this is the answer to the nervous tension sweeping the world it's because they're seeking something they can't get but if you have the capability to receive this do not allow yourself to be left in that nervous tension condition of laodicea accept it for what it is and be grateful and again we're not talking about sinless perfection in our flesh we're talking about a proper understanding of the grace of god that has been extended to us as revealed by the fruit that i have the capability to receive the truth and walk in the truth and love the truth for my age we should never take that lightly it's such an anomaly to us because we we i would say we take it for granted because as believers we came to the world as believers even when we didn't know we were believers we were we were believers and as believers we functioned and we responded to the word of god as believers even when we didn't know we were believers so really all that we've ever known is too above to be a believer that was a mouthful i know but we can't even as a unbeliever or i'll say it this way we can't even in an unbelieving state respond as a true unbeliever we can't think like that we can't function like that we can't operate like that and because of that there's not this there's there's possibly not this huge uh junction in time and moment that we can say oh oh oh this has changed this is different i've never i've never felt like this i've never acted like this especially for those of you that was born and raised in this message there may not be this huge dividing line because you were always in the proper atmosphere and you was always around the truth and you just walked in the truth but don't ever take that lightly and do not ever don't um do not not allow that to be what it is allow it to be what it is the capability to receive the truth for your age is the evidence that you have been with him from the beginning it is worthy of the significance that it stands for ephesians 1 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and in whom also after ye believed believed in what the words of truth ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise how were you sealed with the holy spirit not because you came up here and cried not because you came up here and shouted not because you danced around you spoke in tongues you have a ministry you have gifts of healing you have supernatural you have prophecy you have this that and the other you were sealed with the holy spirit under one condition after that ye have heard the words of truth the gospel of your salvation you believed do not allow somebody to tell you that it's anything other than that can it come with all of those things that i just described absolutely but you can also have all of those things i just described before this happens in and of itself there is only one evidence for the true baptism of the holy spirit receiving the truth for your age period that might make you jump and shout and stand on your head it may make a tear trickle out of the corner of your eye or it may have absolutely no response on you except for a changed life that it will have but that changed life may not even be represented in a physical viewing it may simply be that you changed within because again you take somebody that's born in this message in a real godly christian atmosphere and home they may already be walking the walk and talking the talk and may have all of you fooled but the only person they can't fool is themselves and they know they don't have the goods because they don't have the peace and the comforter on the inside but when they hear the words of truth and they believe on that they receive the comforter and the peace on the inside and they're the only ones that know about it and there's nothing external that changes that's why i say it can come with a lot of things or it may not come with anything outwardly but one thing is for certain you as the individual will know maybe nobody else will know but you will know that you have received the words of truth for your age and it doesn't really matter what everybody else knows and what everybody else sees and whatever everybody else thinks you're the one you're the one that has to know you're the one that matters that is the evidence and we'll touch on that in a little bit of being sealed with the holy ghost the holy spirit the new birth the token the baptism of the holy spirit whatever terminology you want to put on it i don't care what's been preached on it and or who you've heard it from this is one thing that i can say hear the words that i'm speaking unto you because they're truth this is what the scripture says and the religious world the rel the goal of the religious world is to change this and make it something other than this because if they don't change this that the holy spirit is receiving the words of truth and believing them if they don't first change this they can never build a denomination they can never have a religion another religion they first have to chip away at this and make the evidence something else they have to this is where they have to start future home of the heavenly bridegroom brother branham says then jesus said in john 14 when he the holy ghost is come he will bring these things to your memory i just want to interject this because i like it it makes me feel good he does not say that he's going to reveal this to you and it's all new he says it's going to he says it's going to bring things to your memory if he's bringing things to my memory it means i knew something before and i forgot it don't don't take that lightly if you had the capability to forget something that the holy spirit is going to bring to your remembrance it means that you knew it before and the only way that you knew it before is that you was in him in the beginning we take these things lightly and his cliches and his catchphrases really grasp it saints because if you do the comforter will come into your life the rose of sharon the prince of peace he will come he will come he will bring these things to your memory see show you what day you're living in so now we have a vindicated prophet on the scene and he comes along and he says when you receive the holy ghost it will show you what day you're living in so if you don't know what day you're living in do not try to tell me that you have the holy ghost vindicated prophet by default it's impossible you have to have a proper understanding of what day that you're living in in order to have the holy spirit that is what the holy spirit does per the prophet you cannot have the holy spirit without that that is the evidence of the holy spirit is receiving the truth and the truth is recognizing what day that you live in you have to know what day that you live in in order to receive the word for that day because if you don't even know what day that you're living in how can you say i've received the word for this day or what word did you receive the word for this day well what day do you live in i don't know well then how do you know that you received the word for your day i know that's silly but just really think about it it's it really is as simple as brother random made it and as the scripture makes it but the devil has to complicate it because he's got to keep you tore up and the only way to keep you tore up is to make you think that you're not okay so he has to he has to attack this but i just want to encourage you this morning allow it to be as simple as it is really just allow it to be that simple that i was in him in the beginning and i can't be lost because i love his word and i receive it and whenever i have something that don't line up with his word i repent of it and i line up with his word it really is that simple saints there is no other people on the face of the earth that has that capability we take that for granted but there is no other person that has that capability i wasn't going to do this but i'm going to do it anyhow go to revelation chapter 5. i've just got to do this you've got to catch how important this is this isn't in my notes so if i mess this up you just forgive me but i want you to catch this i was thinking about this the other day when i read something revelation chapter five very very very familiar portion of scripture and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth nor under the earth was able to open the book neither to look upon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of judah okay so now we're going into descriptions right weep not weep not because the line of the tribe of judah judah was where the kings came from the root of david hath prevailed and opened the book and to loose the seven seals thereof i'm gonna make this really short so i don't get carried away and lose track of where i'm going brother random says this was the most sublime portion of scripture and when he the lamb which we know is god which we know is jesus christ the only one worthy he attaches one name to his description in the most sublime portion of scripture the root of david he attaches a human name to him other than jesus the one that's worthy to loose the seals the one that's worthy all redemption is hanging on this and in the description he would attach a humanistic name to it other than jesus christ this is profound this is significant the question is why why david why david why not moses why not abraham why not william branham why not why not another name david why david david had one characteristic unlike any other in the scripture david had plenty of mistakes i believe he did we would all agree on that david planned a man's death so that he could take his wife who he had already had impregnated prior to the man die like david did some stuff but his name is attached in the description of the most sublime portion of scripture the prophet says his name is attached to this one coming and opening the book why because the characteristic that david had was regardless of anything that david did david would always repent and line himself up with the word and the characteristic of the one loosing that book was attached to the name of david for that reason that's why i say saints we should never take it lightly that we have the capability to repent and line ourself up with the word because this is the same characteristic that god himself said because that man has that virtue i will mention him in the description of the one who will come and take that book the capability to repent and line yourself up with the word to even have that unction to even have that desire look at where it puts you scripturally saints the devil has a heyday in your psyche and in your emotional realm i would just bring that up to him i'm not saying that he's not going to continue to do that every day he's going to continue to do that every day but this is the answer to the devil's question this is why the seals had to be broke to reveal this to us do not ever take lightly the capability to repent and line yourself up with the word there is only a select group of people on the face of the this earth that has that capability and they're also known as the bride you can't be you can't you can't have that capability and not be the bride saints somebody catch that this morning god's wanting somebody to catch that you cannot have this capability and not be the bride i'm sorry yes i think i said that correctly you understand what i'm trying to say if i didn't say it correctly to have the capability to repent and line yourself up with the word means you are the bride by default you can't have one without the other so if you have the desire i'm going to say it a different way because i've said it every other way if you have that desire to repent and line up with the word do not let satan tell you that it's something different than being the bride only the bride has that i'm not talking about fake repentance i'm not talking about a little bit repentance i'm talking about a full repentance to the word of god only the bride has that brother and says john 14 when he the holy ghost is come he will bring these things to your memory he will show you what day you're living in and then another thing you'll know by him him by he'll show you things to come see right back to the prophetic again when he's come brother branham says when he's come we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest what is the word made manifest him showing things to come he declares something and then he manifests that thing that he declared that was to come brother branham says that is the holy ghost john 6 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophetess nothing the words that i speak to you they are spirit what is spirit the words that i speak to you and they are life what are the words that i speak to you they are life what are the words that i speak to you they are spirit what is the spirit they're the words that i speak to you which is truth revealing the day that you're living in and telling you things to come you will not find any scriptures that says the holy spirit is screaming shouting jumping speaking in tongues prophecy ministry healing you will not find any scripture for that the only scriptures that you will find defining the baptism of the holy spirit and the new birth of receiving the holy ghost is receiving the truth for your age and i'll say like paul says if any man if any angel let alone a man if any angel preaches any other gospel let him be accursed if any minister would preach any other gospel to bring confusion to that let him be accursed per paul because let it be as simple as what god said it is the ability to receive truth for your age is the is receiving god's spirit don't take away from my comforter don't take away from the rose of sharon the prince of peace let him be as simple as what he wants to be let him be a comfort that he wants to be don't try to make his spirit something else john 6 28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god so if you have the spirit of god by default you're going to work the works of god correct and they ask him the question what might we do that we work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god this is the work of god that ye believe on him who he hath sent that's pretty simple allow it to be simple allow it to bring the comfort that simplicity brings the work of god there may be many works of god that christians do there may be many works of the spirit that people do prior to and after and maybe even during them receiving the true new birth and the baptism of the holy spirit but the one baseline evidence that all true born-again christians will have is that they will believe on whom god has sent also by default that means giving up your own idea because you cannot totally believe on whom god hath sent if you still reserve part of your opinion about what they had to say and whether they were right or not that is the work of the spirit of truth to remove your ideas about everything and to receive the ideas from the vindicated messenger messenger of god that he has sent if you can't do that do not try to tell me you have the holy spirit you can't have one without the other and again this brings us to a peculiar group of people because what people has the capacity to give up any of their own ideas and just believe a man it would have been fine if it was jesus christ he wasn't born in sin but now in our day we're talking about a man that was hybrid in his flesh and brother branham says the hardest thing that god has ever tried to do is get one man believe another so again saints look at the look at the capabilities that we have that no other human beings have we have an ability to forsake our own understanding and take what a vindicated prophet of god has said about everything and don't try to tell me you're doing the works of god if you haven't done that first because per the scripture that is the baseline work of god that's where you have to start forsaking your own ideas and believing on who him whom god hath sent if you have not totally sold out to him whom god hath sent and just in case somebody doesn't know him whom god hath sent in our age was william branham brother william branham i'll make it really clear i'll even spell it if you want me to so there's no misunderstanding that was the one that god sent and that is the one that you have to sell out all of your thinking to because that is whom god sent and that is the only way that you can even start to have the spirit of truth in the holy spirit and the new birth is to default to whom god hath sent that's not my words that's jesus's words they ask him the question point blank how can we work the works of god believe on whom i've sent to you i've got nothing else to say on the topic jesus said it john 8 48 jesus said unto them if god were your father you would have loved me for i proceeded forth and come from god neither came i of myself but he sent me so he's making it real clear for them oh by the way i'm the one that he sent if you don't believe on me you're going to die in your sins why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye of ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do what was the lust of their father keeping his own opinion what did the fairs i'm not making that upstairs what did the pharisees do they kept their own opinion jesus said you're going to do what your father did well if we don't know what the father did we just have to wait and see what the pharisees did and then we'll know what their father did what did the pharisees do they kept their own opinion of the word and the of whom god sent that's what satan did in the beginning that's what cain did god told him do this like your brother what did cain do he kept his own opinion spirits die or i'm sorry men die spirits don't die what did the scripture say how can you discern between the spirit of right and wrong forsaking your own opinion year of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was the murderer he was a murderer from the beginning a murder of what a murderer of the truth and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him look at the definitions that he's attaching to this why didn't he just say he was nasty he was evil he murdered he did this because he wanted us to know and properly be able to discern in the final closing moments of time between right and wrong he abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh the lie he speaketh of his own his own what his own opinion he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not speaking to them not us we believe him when he tells us the truth because that's what our father did you say well how do you know that's what your father did because what i do brother brandon says he spoke his word he had to believe his own word for it to manifest so even if i didn't know what the father did i can recognize what i'm doing and what am i doing now that i've received the spirit of truth i believe the truth i believe the word i believe on whom he whom he hath sent and if that's what i'm doing as his son that means that must have been what he did 65 ashamed when god made the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost and you receive it there is something that settles within you that there is nothing takes its place hold this phrase the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost now i'm going to continue when a man ever meets god not in some emotional workup some enthusiasm or some religious doctrine some catechism or creed or a dog dogma that he has accepted for a comfort for himself but when he really comes to the place like moses did on the side of the desert walk up face to face with almighty god and you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and the promise of the hour there is something it does to you see you're not ashamed of it it does something to you now i want to go back and just pull the phrases that he attaches to this what does something to you the baptism of the holy ghost when a man ever meets god face to face with almighty god the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and promise for the hour those four descriptions are the same thing if you ever meet god face to face he's going to tell you the word exactly for the hour that and promise for the age that you're living in that is you meeting god and that is the baptism of the holy spirit you're not ever going to have any of those happen without all four of them happening i'll say it again it really is that simple all right continuing in ashamed now we're going to take a little bit of a turn here because remember we started out the ability to judge between truth and error he says remember you might meet a spirit that would act like god a spirit that would act like god you might meet a spirit would do this that or the other follow it a little bit and see how it compares with the word of god it's pretty good advice because the word of god is the spirit of god and if i want to discern this spirit maybe i'll see what it does with the word maybe i'll see what it does with whom he hath sent maybe i'll see what it does with the promise for this hour then i can accurately discern the spirit he says this spirit might be acting like god though maybe it's coming on a white horse but it don't have any arrows you might meet a spirit that would act like god you might meet a spirit would do this that or the other follow it a little bit and see how it compares with the word of god you might meet a spirit that would tell you you are saved and give you a glorious feeling and you would shout and scream then when it comes to denying the word how can the holy spirit that wrote the word deny his own word that's deceptive saints this is a spirit this is not a spirit acting like a man with a you know fork tongue and horns and a sharp pokey spear this is a spirit that would act like god in so much that it would try to tell you that you are saved and give you a glorious feeling to make you shout and scream you say that's that's close i'll never be able to discern that you're right you won't only the word can that's why he doesn't say anything else to do except for check it by the word see how it responds to the word see how it responds now we say that and we oh yeah of course we we check it by the word no we have to check it by the word of he whom was sent that's the big difference it's not you going back and picking up the scripture and trying to discern whether it's right or wrong you can't even discern that scripture without he whom he hath sent so when i say you ha when you have to check by the word i'm not saying you check it by the word through your own filter you check it through he whom he hath sent filter because if not you're going to find yourself giving over to that spirit that's acting like god and making you believe that you're saved because it gave you a glorious feeling to make you scream and shout or some other gift of the spirit or some other sensation it is only if you run it through the filter of he whom he hath sent that you will be properly judging it by the word remember the baseline evidence is believing on he whom he had sent that's the work of god that's the work of the spirit of the truth that's the baseline we can never deviate away from that as we progress he says you might meet a spirit that would tell you you are saved and give you a glorious feeling now here's the question here's the question why why if the devil is such an evil horrible fellow would he do that why wouldn't he just come and tell you you're a rotten piece of earth and you don't stand a chance that's true that's true but he knows that'll never cut it with the believer because there's something in the believer that they keep coming back and he don't know that they're a believer but he just has to deal with this person that won't quit repenting like give it up already you're a worthless piece of dirt you will never line up to the word of god and then you repent again and he's like just go away already so finally remember the brother brother says he's a very shrewd smart individual he's not some dummy so if you have somebody who won't quit repenting because they know they're not right with god what other options do you have besides trying to tell them okay you're okay now whether they're not whether they are or not if that's what they're after and he only knows that by their actions but they keep repenting and they keep seeking god and they keep seeking the word finally he's going to recognize you know what telling them they're never going to get it it's not going to work telling them that they're worthless and they'll never arrive like they already got that they understand they're okay with that they believe that i'm just gonna i'm just gonna have to tell them that they've made it i'm just going to have to act like the one that they're seeking and tell them they're okay that's the only chance he has saints because if not you're just going to keep repenting until you really do get it so before you do really get it here he comes this is his last tactic i'm going to tell him they've arrived when they really haven't and that will get you every time if you don't check it by the word from whom he hath sent because the word from whom he hath sent will be the word for your age and that's the one thing the devil will not do he'll tell you you're saved he'll tell you you're okay he'll give you glorious sensations he'll give you glorious gifts he'll give you glorious manifestations but one thing that he will not go close to is letting you see the word for your day because by default if he allows you to do that you've arrived and you really have got it and brother branham says he can't go that far he has no capability to go that far that's not my idea take it back to cain cain could not go that far judas could not go that far the pharisees could not go that far they could come all the way up brother brandon says judas could come all the way up but could not go to pentecost he won't go that far but he will go right up to that so the only way that you can make sure that this is not a deceiving spirit that's trying to tell you you are saved when you're really not is if you check it and see whether it's telling you the revealed word for your day and again you will not know the revealed word for your day unless you first received him whom he had sent i know i keep going around and around the cow shed but somebody's going to catch it this morning allow it to be that simple saints because if not we're going to find ourselves deceived we're going brother branham says the satan's deception today right now his deception was one thing to make people believe they're saved when they're not it's the religious spirit he's had his days to where he would just kill you if you profess the name of jesus christ he had those days but it didn't work he tried to kill it out which is what brotherhood says that's what he would do to you right now if god would allow him but he can't take your life so because he can't take your life and take you off the scene the fact that you keep repenting and lining yourself up with the word of god he only has one tactic left he's got to make you think you're okay when you're not and the only way that you'll properly be able to discern that is if you take it back to the words of the prophet if you'll take it back to the teaching and the principles that brother branham laid out it's the only way that you're going to be okay and properly discern it so this is the little angle that we're going off on here is as we come to the closing moments of time remember the scripture said it would be so close it would deceive the very elective it was possible and this is all hinging on the new birth this is all hinging on the true baptism of the holy spirit so that is what once you receive that like satan's done we have that understanding right like once you're born again satan's done so whatever whatever he's going to accomplish or try to accomplish prior to that he has to do prior to that because once you've arrived you you've arrived like you can't be born again and then unborn again you can backslide we all know that that's not what i'm talking about we're talking about the soul we're talking about the new birth we're talking about receiving the spirit of truth once you receive the spirit of truth you can't unreceive the spirit of truth you can receive a spirit of partial truth and then unreceive a spirit of partial truth but you can't unreceive the spirit of the truth because it's a person and once you've got jesus you can't lose jesus because it wasn't you getting jesus to begin with it was jesus getting you so whatever he's going to deceive whatever deception he's going to bring on the scene that would deceive the very elected he has to do it prior to your new birth and it's not the deceiving times won't happen after the new birth but the ability to discern those and withstand those lays within the new birth so it's not that deception won't be attempted or tried or that deception quits coming it keeps coming but after this you're not going to be deceived you may be confused you may be confused for a long long time but at the end of it you're not going to be deceived he says you might meet a spirit that would tell you you're saved and give you a glorious feeling you would shout and scream then when it comes to denying the word how can the holy spirit that wrote the word deny his own word that spirit must punctuate every promise of god with an amen if it isn't then you never met god you met a deceiving spirit and the world is full of it today 1965 the easter seal and the same thing is with every true believer when the preaching of god's word comes forth hold that in your mind when the preaching of god's word comes forth and it's vindicated and proved that it's god work god's word for this hour then there's something within the believer if that church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the holy ghost message what is the message the holy ghost message what is the message for this hour the holy ghost message what is the preaching of god's word that is to come forth the holy ghost message he the spirit of truth that is what is to come forth there's something in him that screams out now when this holy spirit represented as the eagle flying over the land and finds the believer it isn't your own thinking your own drawing it's god drawing now the holy spirit is here on earth looking out those individuals that god has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on jesus christ the great super son of god who redeemed us all it comes down watch what it does it comes down and takes its place of abode in the human life now notice it brought the quickening power now that quickening power that comes that came upon jesus quickened him to manifest the promise manifest what promise the promise for his age but look what he says now to manifest every promise of the word of that day so does the holy spirit that came upon us in this day if it's not a mockery holy spirit a mockery holy spirit talk about deception satan again is not coming riding on a black horse as the grim reaper he is coming as a spirit that would make you feel that believe that you're saved when you're not he is coming as a mockery holy spirit this this so jumped out to me when i was listening to this in this terminology a mockery holy spirit if i was a mockery holy spirit what would i do i'm going to back up once one step the only thing that i can't do is reveal the truth for the age that you live in because if i do that i'm the holy spirit but i'm only a mockery holy spirit so if i am a if i want to be the best mockery holy spirit in the closing moments of time where i will deceive the very elect if it was possible what all would i do i would do everything the holy spirit does except for tell them the truth for the day that they live in based upon the message of whom god hath sent that's what i would do maybe i'm just a dummy but that seems like the right thing to do if i want to be a really good mockery holy spirit now if i wanted to just be an evil spirit i'd come make you commit adultery smoke cigarettes live in sin i'd just make you do all that other stuff but if i was really trying to get as many as i could and if i was really trying to get the elect if it was possible i know remember brother brown says satan is a religious spirit he knows he knows he's not going to get us out there we've already seen too much so the only thing that he can do is imitate as best as he can that real holy spirit but remember there's a line that he can't cross or he would be the holy spirit if i was going to be the best mockery holy spirit i would do every manifestation and every gift and every emotional realm workup that i could but i sure wouldn't let you know what the truth of the hour was and i sure wouldn't let you know that if you have the ability to repent and constantly line yourself up with the truth of the hour that that means that you're broad i sure wouldn't tell you that i definitely would make it way more complicated than that and i would definitely tell you every time you messed up and didn't line up with the word and i would say that right there's your evidence because you're not lining up with the word i would tell i would i if i was going to be the best mockery holy spirit i would probably even tell you that more than once a day but that's that's just me i don't know what he would do i've never really dealt with him you know but that's probably what i would do if it's not a mockery holy spirit by default that means there is a mockery holy spirit like it or not if it's not the devil mocking the holy spirit but if it's the real true holy spirit it'll manifest the promise of this hour now you say well what is the promise promise of this hour glad i don't have to use my own interpretation there because the prophet interpreted that for us he says what is the bride the manifestation of this hour what is the manifestation of this hour the bride what is the bride the word made manifest the whole word made manifest that's this hour not impartiality so the one thing the devil is not going to tell you is that you are the bride and you are the fullness of the word made manifest in this hour he'll tell you everything other than that some bad some good because you have this gift in your life means you're okay means you're the bride he'll tell you that you're a minister there's no way that you're not the bride you believe god sent a prophet there's no way that you're not the bride he believes god sent a prophet but he sure won't repent and line up with what he had to say see the difference see the difference the ability to repent and line up with the spirit of truth is the only evidence you can hang your soul on saints it's the only one you can hang your soul on it'll manifest the promise of this hour notice if he's a true eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's an eagle you say ah it's too deep i can't understand it if you're an eagle you will understand the message of the hour what really is the problem when people confess that is they make the message more complicated than what it really is when you make the message more complicated what than what it is then you can't understand it but i just want you to answer me one question if in malachi 4 god sent you a prophet you have to make that personal because if you just say god sent a prophet it does no good the devil believes that but if god sent you a prophet and you can't understand the principles of what he had to teach what good did it do for god to send a prophet and if you are the elect of god why would god send you a prophet you can't understand see the problem is we let that little deceiving mockery holy spirit come in and try to make it something more deep and more mysterious than what it really is and it's not that it's not deep and it's not that it's not mysterious as brother chad said a little while back the message is simple but it's not simplistic there is a truth to that it is deep it is mysterious but i'll tell you the most deepest and mysterious thing in the whole wide world you want to hear what that is it's a people that will continually come to a service and get called out about what is wrong in their life and repent and line up to the true word of god that's the most mysterious thing in the world you say well no it's not yes it is because the person that's telling them and calling them out and preaching the true word of god is born in sin and shaped an iniquity of themselves it would be no mystery if jesus christ was standing here himself in his 16 elements and preaching to us well that would be easy to line up with but now he would come and use a hybrid vessel to preach the true word of god and a people would be able to receive that and line up to it that's deep that's mysterious brother iran says that's the hardest thing god has ever had to do now the little eagle probably in the barnyard barnyard was eating all right but he knowed it wasn't just exactly right but then when he heard the truth then he received the truth now in john 5 24 jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come unto the judgment but is passed from death and to life just think how simple that is he that believeth now the correct way of saying that is he that understandeth so the prophet even comes along and says think how simple that is the ability to understand the spiritual principles from he whom god hath sent remember understanding the spiritual principles does not mean that you can go to somebody and tie it together from genesis to revelation you may have no capacity to do that it takes a gift to do that even gifts have a problem doing that that does not mean that you do not understand the message the message is the principles from the tree of life the message is the principles of truth and you receive the principles of truth when you receive that and you repent of your own ideas and line up to that you can receive the principles of the message and not be able to rightly divide the message to anybody that has nothing to do with it it takes a gift to to divide that brother brandon even so much in questions and answers he says go be a witness go be like go go tell somebody about the love of christ he says but now if it comes to something you just can't tie together he says that's fine take them to the pastor didn't say that means you're backslid that means you're not elect that means you're not bright he didn't he didn't make any qualms about it he says that's fine just tell them about the love of christ if it comes to something you can't tie together in the scriptures that's what the preachers are for that's what those gifts are for that doesn't make them any better because they may not even have been able to testify to that person it doesn't make anybody better or less or anything it's just operating in the capacity and the ability that god has given to us i want to lay emphasis on letting it be as simple as god made it because if you don't you're not going to stand the test of time that is coming you are not going to stand the pressure that is coming you are going to be deceived by some other spirit that would tell you you're okay when you're not line up with the word of god and when you line up with the word of god let it mean what it means for you to have that ability i've been a little over an hour now so we're going to come to a close i want to read you a couple more quotes if that's okay do i need to make you stand up and do jumping jacks run some laps stand on your head okay in the church age book brother branham says now get the real meaning of what we're going into i must caution you to ever keep in mind that religion spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts that intertwine but are as opposite as black and white religion and spiritual world and the spiritual world are made of these two trees which had their roots in eden both the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branch branches intertwined with each other the church is made up of the same it is made up of good and bad remember he says the spiritual world and the religious world they intertwine they're made up of the same good and bad two vines make the church but one is true the other is false catch this statement this is profound now god will speak to each one he just says there's true and there's false and god will speak to both of them god will talk to the false fun god will speak to this false fine not kind of speak will speak god will speak to the mockery holy spirit to the false vine that's why people like to make prophecy and whether it comes to pass the end-all be-all but it's not just because somebody prophesies and it comes to pass that is not the end-all be-all the prophecy must line up with the word the prophecy must line up with the characteristics and the principles of the vindicated messenger for that age look at balaam did what balaam say come to pass yes who was talking to balaam god was talking to balaam brother branham says god will talk to both vines he will give them prophecies he will give them ministries he will give them gifts remember god talking is not necessarily verbage it may be manifestations that is god talking god will talk through a healing ministry god will talk through the gift of prophecy god will talk through the gift of discernment god will talk he will speak to the false vine gifts and callings are without repentance now god will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church both groups he will call them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true spirit only the elect will not be deceived this is god himself speaking to truvine and the false fine he will speak to them he will speak about them and brother branham says only the elect have the capability to discern what he's really saying and which is which file like i said don't ever take lightly the capabilities that we have to hear the truth and to know that he's talking to us we should never underestimate that ability in that capability only the elect will not be deceived matthew 24 24 for there there shall arrive false christ false christ false anointed ones we know this false prophets shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so way back there in the early church a very short period after pentecost the false vine got to intertwine itself around the true vine and we find the deeds of the nickelodeons what that was the deeds of the niculadians to overthrow the laity and that spirit is going to be found fighting the true vine until it is destroyed by god what spirit the false vine spirit a spirit a mockery holy spirit is what's going to be fighting the true vine a mockery holy spirit that god will speak to and about that's why god speaking through somebody is not even any evidence god may speak through somebody and it's no evidence god spoke through a donkey one time you think he had the holy ghost it'll be so closely to deceive the very elected that is why above all things saints above all things and i shared this with brother chad i said you know we we pray as we're coming to minister you know what the mind of the lord is and what we what he wants us to say i said but anymore i don't even feel like preaching i said i just want to stand before the people and tell them how grateful that i am that god sent me a voice that i know the right the way of right and wrong god sent me a voice god sent he loved me so much that he sent me a voice that i would not be deceived because if it wasn't for that voice i would not stand a chance and as we see the world dissolving into chaos and madness on every handstand people are losing their mind i cannot tell you in the last month how many phone calls i've got just because of the nature of the business that i do of people out of their minds i don't know what spirit was released in the last month but it was a bad one and people are insane they are absolutely nuts people brother brown says it's going to be what they've seen in their imagination becoming real before them but they won't know that it's not real i'm telling you saints we have arrived we have arrived if you knew of the amount of people that thought that there was cameras in their house and people listening to them and drones flying around following them each and every day and radar affecting their body and people are believing that other people have the capability to implant something in their brain and speak to them they call it a voice to brain technology and they want me to fix it i can't fix it doesn't matter how much you pay me i can't fix it i've got something that will fix it but i can't fix it but i'm telling you i don't know what released that spirit but it is it is rampant right now people are losing their minds they are crazy and i would be the same way and you would be the same way if god had not loved us enough to send us a voice and that's all that i want to declare this morning as we stand i'm just going to stop if i go farther we're going to be here for another hour but i want to stand here and declare thank you god thank you jesus that you loved me that you would send me a voice so that i would be able to properly discern as the musicians would come that i could properly discern between right and wrong and that i would be able to properly discern who he the spirit of truth is saints of god forsake your own idea believe on him he whom god hath sent totally forsake all give over to that voice it's the only chance we have and god loved you and me enough that he would not let us be deceived but he would send us a voice how grateful we should be saints there is a lot of things to preach there is a lot of glorious things in the word of god there is beautiful shadows and types but above all i just want to say how thankful i am he sent me a voice the grace of god where would i be where would you be if he did not send us a voice and how foolish how foolish we would be not to yield to that voice to recognize it for what it is and to forsake our own ideas and our own opinions how foolish we would be the scripture says that how foolish you would be to cast to cast eternal life away how foolish we would be that god would love us enough number one just even let us recognize who that voice was and then give us the capability to hear that voice and give us a capability to repent as david would repent and line up to that voice how thankful we should be that we have that capability don't take it lightly and don't let satan try to tell you the holy spirit in receiving the new birth and the gift of the whole the baptism of the holy ghost is something other than that that is it that is the wholeness of it the ability to receive the word for your age the ability to hear that voice let's pray together before i keep preaching precious lord jesus lord there's plenty more to say here lord i don't feel that i've got very far but i just i feel that it's far enough for today lord lord we just want to bow here humbly lord and as i said there's a lot to preach there's a lot to say there's a lot to bring out but lord we just want to close this service in thanksgiving father lord that you would look down upon us a hybrid sinful hell-bound race of people lord and you would say i'm not going to let that one go that way i'm not going to let the end that one go to that end of destruction lord but you would look down and say i'm going to place something within that one because i know he'll respond to it that she'll respond to it lord and and you would place that within us before the foundation of the world and then in your amazing intelligence and sovereignty and simplicity lord you would just send us a voice that would bring that seed to life lord knowing that your seed would quicken to the word father we cannot be thankful enough father lord we cannot we do not have words and vocabulary to express our gratitude but we would just pray that you would look down on each and everyone's heart here this morning lord and and just see how grateful and thankful and how we praise your holy name for the voice that you have sent us father that we do not have to wonder in chaos and and confusion as the rest of the world is doing nowadays as as satan would finish setting up his edom on this earth and destruction and sin is rampant and confusion is rampant but we can stand a solid stable right-minded people because you sent us a voice to write our minds lord to bring us a proper understanding lord we are so grateful for that and we worship your name for that lord and we would just pray that as we have recognized that for what it is that you would come in your sovereign ability and allow us to die out to ourselves lord reveal to us those things that we have have need to yield to you and to line up to your word father for if you don't come and reveal them to us lord we just won't know lord warren we're incapable we're fragile human beings we're confused already lord if you don't come in your grace and your mercy and reveal to us what we need to change lord we have no ability to but we think we're thankful lord that that's your desire as it is our desire for you said you would have a bride without spot or wrinkle and that is our desire lord to be without spot or wrinkle we just worship your name and thank you lord for what you have placed within us lord and what you have brought to us and we would just ask as we would depart that we would relax and allow that to mean what it really means lord that we would take stability in that and that we would allow the comforter to be the comforter and that we would not be tossed about but we would allow your word to stand as it is we love you and we worship you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you brother ben if you'll sing a song [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] you jesus for the grace that you have given [Music] how grateful we should be that we have that ability and we can recognize that and stand here with a voice and a clear mind to give him the praise that he deserves [Applause] [Music] once again now thank you [Music] all saints i'm not trying to work on your emotions but just think where you would be without that where would i be without that without that voice where would we be singles oh let us not take it for granted he warned us not to take it for granted don't
