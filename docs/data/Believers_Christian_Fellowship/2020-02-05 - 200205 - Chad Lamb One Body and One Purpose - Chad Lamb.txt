feel my god this first [Music] [Music] and as the heartland so my soul [Music] is the lord [Applause] with thy words [Music] i lived [Music] my soul [Music] here's my [Music] turn your eyes upon and the things of this earth will let's sing it again [Music] it is wonderful is is wonderful face and the things of his earth will grow strangely [Music] is amen let's just turn our eyes onto him not to a man and not to each other but to him amen let's take our bibles over standing and let's turn to the book of first corinthians chapter 14. i just want to thank brother ben coli for stepping out in faith you know it's not easy to do that but i appreciate him following the leading leadership of the lord and taking the risk to step into something god's calling him to and i really appreciate that for everybody who's willing to do that amen what we're standing let's take a look at first corinthians 14. and verse 12. even so ye for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church so this he's speaking to the corinthian church and the corinthian church was they were zealous for gifts they liked gifts but he wanted them to excel to the edifying of the church because all those gifts were there to edify or build up the church and he wanted to be excellent not just for the gift but for the gift that will build up the church and i'd like to take for a subject this evening and talk about one body and one purpose one body and one purpose and let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this day that we have to be together and all we know the weather outside is not good lord but you're good and god we know that your hand of protection is upon us lord because we're your children and we're here lord because you've called us together and while we pray you bless all those that have come lord that you would protect them that you would change whatever needs to be changed so that after this service we can go home safely lord that you would take care of us along the way for those who weren't able to make it lord because of the conditions we pray should bless them may they be able to stream or whatever they're doing lord that your blessings would be upon them but father we're looking to you now that that you would just speak to us this evening while we've gathered here we've not gathered in vain we've gathered with a purpose lord and we pray your purpose would be accomplished take your preeminence among us and speak through these lips of clay we pray in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats amen praise god i appreciate you coming out amen the weather forecast is a little mixed but praise god the forecast from god's not mixed all is well amen he takes care of everything so we just appreciate that very much so tonight i have a unique subject i want to talk about not really the preaching subject i want to get into that but there's been something that's been happening and transpiring for a little while now that i just want to bring to everybody's attention and uh something that i've been watching and and and god god is raising up another gift amongst us and he's raising up the gift of a prophet right here amongst us here in the assembly and it's and it's unusual for us but it shouldn't be unusual for us because we believe we're going back to the book of acts church and in the book of acts they had all of the gifts operating and so i've been spending some time over the last few years with brother rich levy and god has been bringing brother rich through some very prophetic experiences and uh it's been happening for some time uh going back as much as four years but really in the last two to three years things have been growing in intensity frequency and clarity i would say it that way and brother rich has been very good about coming to me all the time and just sharing and not not knowing what direction things are going in not knowing what's happening just sharing the experiences that he's been having but these experiences i can tell you are very prophetic and and they keep they keep pointing us in a direction and and for the last couple of years it's not been clear which direction things are going in but i believe of late god is making it clear that he's raising up a gift amongst us and i want to do some teaching on that because you know i i was thinking myself i've never seen this happen i don't know how long you've been around or what you've seen but i've i've never seen this if i'd come to you and i say there's a brother in assembly and he feels a calling to preach well we've seen that happen before and we say yeah i can understand that but but when i tell you that god is raising up a gift of a prophet amongst us all the sudden it's like i don't know i've never seen that how does that work and there's a little bit of hesitation that we can have because of the unfamiliar but the words not unfamiliar on the subject and the message isn't either so i want to take a look at the word and at the message and see if we can find familiar ground and see if we can be properly taught and have the proper understanding amen because i think it's important to understand if god's doing something i want to understand what he's doing and i want to properly approach it with the proper attitude the way god the way god's bringing it and like i said before with anything that god does i don't want to be ahead of him and i don't want to be behind him i don't want to be to the left i don't want to i want to be right in the mark wherever god is i want to be there and when god raises up a gift it's easy to go ahead or stay behind out of fear or move ahead out of fanaticism but what we want to do is be where god is so we want to look at the scriptures and and and then talk about not just offices but gifts and offices and if you'll turn with me to first corinthians 12 we'll go through a bit of a bible study and look at the message and then i'll explain some more of what's been going on first corinthians 12. and verse 1 first corinthians 12 1. now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant you know that you were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as you were led therefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administration but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but is the same god which worketh all in all so there's a diversity of gifts we know that right but within the diversity of gifts there's a diversity also of administrations the way the gift is administered and beyond that there's a different manifold presentation of operations so there's so there's a there's a uh let me get the wording right here so there's a diversity of gifts there's also a diversity of the way it's administered and there's a diversity of the way it's operated sometimes when we use the word profit we instantly go to brother branham and now our ideas profit everything has to be exactly like brother branham but it doesn't have to be exactly like brother branham brother bannon was raised up to be a prophet of the age amen he's a prophet not in a five-fold prophet one of those prophets but he's a prophet over the five full ministry he's a prophet of the entire age so immediately when we hear that word all of a sudden we we go right there because that's the example we've seen so much but that's not necessarily there's a diversity of gifts there's a diversity of administrations and there's a diversity of operations so just because we've seen something one way one time doesn't mean it always has to operate that way all right we're clear we want to let god do what god's doing the way god does it because every gift can operate in a unique way for instance you know you can take two preachers and they can preach totally two totally different styles they can administer the gift and operate the gift in two totally different ways and and we're not uncomfortable with that right we get comfortable with that because we've seen it so much so when we use the term profit we and we we always get this enigma or this image but we need to relax for a minute and just look at the scriptures and understand amen that there's a there's a diversity of administrations and a diversity of operations verse six again but is the same god which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so the the spirit is given to each one for different things to profit everyone for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these work at that one and self same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so god's the one who divides it up separates it as he will for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because i am not the i am i not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the hole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you name much more those members of the body which we seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncommonly parts have more abundant comeliness for our comedy parts have no need but god has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacketh that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it and where one member be honored all members rejoice with it now you are the body of christ and members in particular and god has said some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers and after that miracles then gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gift of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shall i unto you a more excellent way so the apostle paul is very much taking the body of christ and typing it to our physical body and when our physical body we have members that are diverse from one another very different from one another you can't compare your liver to your finger but yet they're all important for the working of the body and everything in your body works together for the edifying of the body that's why i titled this one body and one purpose everything in my body is working for one purpose it's working to keep my body alive functioning moving doing what my what my purpose is and that's each one of us every one of us is an individual amen are placed in the body for one purpose and that's to keep the body going and so it doesn't matter what gift we have what position we're in and where we are in this body we know that we're talking about the entire body the universal body of jesus christ but what works in the universal works in the microcosm as well and it also works here as a local body and here in the local body amen we god is placed in the body everything that the body needs so that there's no lack but there's one body with one purpose and that purpose isn't for individual members to rise above others if god if god gives an ability to my finger if god gives an ability to my pancreas they won't be the same ability but they each have an ability to work together for the edifying of the body that makes sense so we have to understand what what paul's trying to teach us so that we can move forward now let's go to ephesians chapter 4. ephesians chapter 4 and verse 10. he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ so why were the offices given for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god and to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ for we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men in the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working and the measure of every part making increase of the body and to the edifying of itself in love you get the point every part has one purpose different office different administration amen amen sometimes a different operation but all for one purpose so if god's going to raise something up among us it's for the same purpose for the same purpose he'll raise up a minister an evangelist a pastor the same reason to raise up a song leader or a musician or somebody who can write songs is the same reason he'll raise up any gift in any position in the body now what we've read here in the five-fold what we've termed as the fifth ministry is these are offices so you have gifts and you have offices so the people who have an office in the church have gifts all right but not everybody have gifts has an office that makes sense they're two different things and god god ordains the offices not man it's what god places in the church the offices but the spirit also gives gifts amen and the gifts are given severally as he will so everybody gets a measure of the spirit and everybody gets some something for the body amen and those are gifts but not everybody with a gift holds an office but everybody with an office has a gift that makes sense okay let's look at a couple things the prophet of god says here in the submergent church age 1960 god never intended the church to be run by men god runs his church and he runs it through the gifts of the spirit the gifts of the spirit is in the church to correct the spirit he's got five ministerial officers in his church first of them as apostles or missionaries missionaries the highest calling there is apostle the word missionary means one sin apostle means one cent he says but they are apostles all right apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors now that's the elected offices of god to his church then in each local church there is nine spiritual gifts that come among the people that is knowledge wisdom gift of healing working of a miracle speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and all these things go in each local body and every person in the church has an individual ministry and that individual ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of christ so nobody can say they don't have a ministry because the prophet said you do we may not be clear what it is we may not know that we're operating it or not but it's been given to us and odds are we're already operating in it but don't know it but every individual ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to the edifying of the body of christ but the man preaches in 1959 balm and gilead says now there's five offices that god puts in the church there's nine spiritual gifts that accompany that offices and all the members of the body the first is apostles which is missionaries the word apostle means one that sent a missionary apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists these offices god sets in the church they're all in operation or should be you got that they're all in operation or should be we cannot bypass one and say there's teachers without saying evangelists we cannot say there's evangelisms without saying there's apostles we cannot say there's apostles without admitting there's prophets all of them are for the perfecting of the body of christ so brother branham clearly tells us that this is this and the scriptures clearly tell us that this is one of the offices in the church in the new testament church and it in it and it should brother said it should be there he said it should it said they're all in operation or should be and so we for us you know for me personally i've never seen this now i've seen brother abraham myra and brother abraham clearly is a gift of a prophet but he's also a pastor and he's also a preacher and i've witnessed this gift operate and it operates and i've seen it but i didn't see it come up you know i didn't see when it started as a boy how god dealt with him and how god got everything got placed i just see it now years and years later and i accept it for what it is because you see it right and it doesn't you know to me it's not scary because you see it operating amen but but but to see something come up for us and now is it's a new experience for us and that's shameful because it shouldn't be i don't believe it should be a new experience but for us it is but what do we expect if god keeps taking his word and lining us to his word and lifting us higher and higher bringing us back to what the book of acts church really was what should we expect to be happening we should expect it but when it comes although we expect it it comes he always does things in an unusual way that requires you to have faith in what he's doing that's just the plan of god that's just the way god does it he does things an unusual way in an unexpected way amen so that you're going to have to still operate by faith to accept what god's doing but we should have expected these things we should expect more we should expect we should expect this and more amen so so although it's unusual that's shameful to say it's unusual but hey god will forgive us for that because we're moving we're moving we're not staying stationary we're moving to where god wants us to be by his grace he's moving us as a body of believers to that full manifestation of what he has determined before the foundation of the world for us to be and i don't believe we're going to get out of here that we're till we're firing on all brother ben said all 16 cylinders so everything's in operation everything's working and the spirit of god has total preeminence over every gift and every office and everything's clicking just right on time i don't think we're going on a body change till that's happening so we should expect more and more and more to come along let's look at romans 12. before we get into a lot more keep wanting to lay down a scriptural foundation and look at the message romans 12 and verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according that god has dealt to every man the measure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the pro to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teaches on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimilation abort that which is evil and cleave to that which is good so god is keeps telling us the same thing in the scriptures there's one body many membered and every joint is differing but supplying everything is different but with one common purpose and one common goal so it's one body with one purpose amen brother bam says in the message blind bartimaeus from 1959 i hope i didn't lose anything to another is good stewardship i've lost something i've lost part of my quote but we'll come back to it maybe i'll find it actually i know what i'll do sorry bear with me for a second i don't want to lose my quote all right yeah blind bartimaeus 1959 now in the church he has sent gifts some are apostles apostle and a missionary is the same word meaning once sent he said uh he goes on down he says a missionary prophets apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors that's the office of the church and these offices should be alive with the holy spirit not set in by man but set in by the holy spirit in each church you got that not set in by man but set in by the holy spirit in each church apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors these are offices that god set in the church man has nothing to do with it god puts them in the church that's the way we want it god has nothing to do with our man has nothing to do with it god puts it in the church and i'm going to try to go back and hopefully i haven't lost anything i know you don't know what that means but i know what that means to go back all right so we want to keep keep following this thought through now when brother branham when he's teaching on prophets many times when he begins to talk about a new testament prophet or prophets in modern day most of the time when he's talking he's trying to vindicate his ministry and show his ministry and brother branham you know he's like john the baptist he's a prophet yay and more than a prophet because he was prophesied to come and be a forerunner and brother brennan was the same thing he was a prophet yay and more than a prophet and then he was there to fulfill certain scriptures and he came as a forerunner for the second coming and so brother branham many times when he's talking about prophet and explaining it you can show he's trying to get the people to understand the concept of what his office is and so he explains it in that certain way but what brother branham doesn't always do he does in a few places and we'll look at that but he doesn't always break down what the other prophets would look like not the prophet of the age but the prophets that's in the church he doesn't always go into detail to explain that but he does in a few places so i'll i'll go to those in just a minute amen all right let's let's turn to first peter 4 catch another scripture here first peter chapter four first peter chapter four and verse seven it's the same theme when we were picking it up by peter now it says but the end of all things is at hand hey where does that place us where does that place this scripture see these things matter the end of all things is at hand i like that so now we're right here we're right in this scripture but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity or love among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins use hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any men minister let him do it as the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom he prays in dominion forever and ever amen if you prophesy do it according to the grace of god if you speak as the oracle of god amen whatever you do do according to the channel that god's working through you and we're not here to imitate one another and we're not here to put ourselves in positions or take positions upon ourselves this is clear we're not here to say you're this and you're that brother benham said that's where the latter reign made their mistake they tried to man to appoint gifts and men by laying on their hands to appoint certain positions and he said god does those things but you're here to minister according to the faith and according to the grace and faith that's been given to you and that goes for each of us not just certain gifts and differing from others but that's for each of us to operate according to the grace that's been given to us by the faith that's been given to us so that jesus christ gets the glory this isn't a man-made effort i should put it that way this is not a man-made effort and this is not anybody with the ability to press themselves into anything you're never going to press yourself into anything there's no seeing an office and wanting that office and working towards that office or towards that gift that'll never happen it's not going to happen the spirit gives those out severally as he will and god ordains those offices into the church you can't you can't strive for it you can't climb to it you can't work towards it it's something that if it's going to happen it's going to happen it's going to happen to you and it's going to happen through you so there's no pressing no striving there's actually a just getting sincere with god and dedicating your life to god and letting god do what god's going to do with you because he's already predetermined he's already appointed it we just have brother baby said the secret to operating any gift is to relax not to press not to strive not to make ourselves something or push ourselves in anything but just to relax and let god do what god's gonna do uh because because when we use the term profit we our minds always go to certain places amen i just wanted to talk about this for a minute because if you look in the old testament at all the prophets you see that those prophets didn't operate the same way is that true you have you have isaiah who was a prophet who was brought up under a king and he was with the king all the time but he was leaning on the the the arm of flesh and we know what happened to you to isaiah so isaiah was brought up he was a prophet brought up under the king and the palace with all those things but then you have amos who was a herdsmen who nobody ever heard before and he just tromped into town one day and dropped prophecy and nobody knew who he was where he come from he said i'm not a prophet or the son of a prophet but he said when the lion roars who can keep his peace you know so it wasn't always the same way we've had prophets from many different tribes right we've had prophets that would minister and they would give a prophecy one time in the bible and never again you say then you have prophets who are responsible for writing the bible so they operate differently you have prophets who use symbols you'd have prophets like jeremiah i think it was jeremiah who would make a wooden yoke and he said by this you'll be yoked amen and one took it and broke it over their knee so he's using a symbol but then you have another prophet like mikaya who stands before ahab and jehoshaphat he uses no symbols at all he just says what he saw in heaven he saw a scene play out he heard a conversation and he tells what he saw in heaven jeremiah doesn't tell what he saw in heaven jeremiah brings a yoke as a symbol and saying this is what's going to happen you see they're not copying each other and all the way down to the old testament these these prophets operated very differently in their operation you had a i believe it was ezekiel i may be wrong but ezekiel was a levite and a priest and so you have a levite and a priest who's also a prophet but you didn't have to be a levite and a priest to be a prophet so you have all these different things and you have even like like jeremiah jeremiah amen his life became a symbol of prophecy when he's told to strip his clothes off and lay on one side for so many days and then to flip to the other side and that was going to be a symbol of what was coming to the church but mackay didn't have to do that and isaiah didn't have to do that so when we want when we want a gift to always operate the same time every way we're going to miss what god's sending if they would have wanted jeremiah to act like isaiah when he stripped naked and laid on his side there would have been mass rejection that's not and he was rejected right because sometimes it comes differently than what you expected the prophet hosea was told to go and marry a harlot and to have children and then name them names that would prophesy a condition that was happening and and the names were horrible amen in the lives of the children were horrible but they were acting out amen in their life what was going to happen in prophecy to israel so you can see if if you were in israel that day and god was sending you a prophet and you had in your mind the way a prophet had to act every prophet has to be like moses you'd have missed jeremiah you'd have missed hosea you would have missed so many things if you had to make them all the same so not every prophet is going to have the same administration in the same operation does that make sense i want to explain to you some of of how god is dealing with our brother rich because it's unusual and it's unique to him but we want god to be god and god to decide what the gift is going to look like because because when when god's been dealing with brother rich over the last little bit he's dealt with him with dreams he's dealt with him with visions open vision and the word of the lord has come to a voice he sort of the lord the word of the lord speak to him an interpretation of a dream or a prophecy that will come to pass and so it's not just brother ben said there's a difference between somebody with a gift of prophecy and a prophet he said a gift of prophecy can move from one to the other to the other to the other it doesn't stay on the same person it can be in one person one time and never again and it can go from person to person in the church it can come through tongues and interpretation it can come through a word of knowledge it can come even even a few times in a person's life but a prophet is different than a gift of prophecy but a prophet will have the gift of prophecy but it's different that prophet is built to be a prophet and they operate differently it's not just a gift of prophecy and as uh as brother rich has been talking with me and sharing with me and we've been talking for him these are new things too and when brother rich first come to talk to me it's not like he had everything ironed out and knew where he was going and what was happening these things were happening to him uncontrollably involuntarily things were just happening he'd have a dream he'd have a vision the word of the lord would come to him and things would happen and it was involuntary but he he he wasn't able to say this is that i i know exactly what god's doing he's saying this is just happening just like it would be for any of us this is just happening but the beauty of it is we've known brother rich for how long how long have you been here brother rich 20 some years brother rich hasn't been chasing crazy stuff and in the fanaticism for 20 some years he's been a steady stable brother in the church so when these things begin to happen you have to take notice it's not it's not like somebody who's always on the fringes and somebody who's always dabbling in something way off here and but no this is a brother right among us who's having prophetic things happen to him that are unusual unusual to him unusual to us but you have to take note when you begin to see a pattern set in and you begin to see things happen another thing that that is unusual with what happens with brother rich is god will do something in his life and and something will happen to him in his physical life at work or with family or whatever something that's happening and and it will play out like everything in our lives play out circumstances will come to pass things will happen and then then all of a sudden god will come to him and he said many times god will come to him when he's going to bring an interpretation or give him a revelation of what's happening he said he'll wake him up in the morning and not when he's not quite awake and he's not yet asleep but somewhere in between the word of the lord will come he said he may speak a phrase may speak just a few words but when that happens the whole revelation of the event downloads and he's got the whole interpretation and then he'll look back and see what was taking place in his life was just a scenario that god was going to use to show him something that's coming or something that's happening you understand that just like the prophets of old and and there's been several things that's happened several things that the lord has showed him or dealt with him some things have to deal with in into the future somewhere in the future we don't know where some things are happening concurrently and some things have already happened i've watched them come to fruition i've watched them happen but unfortunately i'm not going to be able to share everything with you because some of these things are are very sensitive because they involve people's names and they evolve things that are difficult that are hard and and things that have happened and and i just don't feel like that can be exposed openly but what i did is i asked all the deacon brothers to come together and a couple other brothers in assembly that i know have spiritual gifts and we came together sunday after communion service over in my office and brother rich had the opportunity to share give some background and share what's been happening over the last several years and we met for four and a half hours and there's a lot of details i'm telling you there's a lot of things that go together for four and a half hours he explained to myself which i had already heard it all all the deacons and a couple of the other brothers that i had felt in my heart to have come and after you sit and you listen to everything unfold and everything transpire and you start to see click click click click click you realize this isn't a gift of prophecy this is god's god's raised up a gift of a prophet it's more than just a gift of a prophecy this is this is more than that this is after the new testament order of a prophet and and that doesn't scare me and i hope it doesn't scare you because these things should be here is it unusual yes is it new is anything new under some a suspect that's the way we've been but it shouldn't be because these are actually old things that are coming back to the church this is actually not new things these are things that should have been here all along but we're lost somewhere but it's it's it was established by the apostle paul it was in the book of acts it should have been here all along but great praise be to god is coming back now now me and the brothers when we sit and heard this we we realized god was doing something in our midst and and i'll i'll add this i'll inject inject this here there was another dream that brother rich had in in i'm not going to share with you the dream because he doesn't have the interpretation of it but in the dream when you begin to describe it it's obvious that there's something going to happen there's going to be something that god's going to do that he's going to make his bride aware of ahead of time and it's going to be i believe with all my heart on a big scale but but yet brother rich didn't get thus saith the lord on he doesn't have a word from the lord he doesn't have the interpretation you know so there's no presuming and we don't want to presume we don't want to say that we know it might be this but from everything that we i look at i can see i i sense in my spirit there's something that god wants to share with us to prepare us for the future but i i'm saying that for this reason when we heard everything that was happening we heard the testimony and we got to see for ourselves what god has been doing i realized that in this is just brother chad only brother chad i can't say that the lord told me this but inside in my spirit i sensed we better not miss our opportunity that i felt like we need to receive the gift god's given us and if we can receive by faith the gift god's given us and we can pray as a body i believe god will use that gift to bring the interpretation of the dream instead of waiting for the interpretation to dream and wait for everything to be in a nice package and come and tell you thus thus doesn't us i i don't want to wait for that i want to move when god moves and move by faith and if we can recognize that god's raised the gift of among us i want to accept it as from god and then pray and pull on the gift and believe that god will give the interpretation of the dream so that's not wishy-washy it's not presuming it's not any man's idea but it's of the lord and and so that's that's what we're what's what we're wanting to do today we're wanting to to receive what god's giving us we're wanting to accept what god's doing and we want to accept it by faith amen i want to take a look at a at a new testament prophet in the book of acts if we can turn to acts 11 together and just lay this in here acts chapter 11 and verse 27 and in those days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch and there stood up one one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judea which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul so now from jerusalem comes prophets down into antioch and one of them named agabus stands up and he prophesies of a worldwide famine you get this a worldwide famine and why does he prophesy of a worldwide famine so that the church can be prepared so that they can start putting money aside so they could help out those that are in judea and guess who took the money paul and barnabas guess what paul didn't prophesy of the famine another prophet did you see what i'm saying it wasn't all in one source it wasn't all in one place that god had there was another prophet not on the same level of paul agabis we don't have anything agabus wrote we don't have anywhere where agabus set the word straight i mean we don't have anywhere where activists left the book behind we don't have anywhere where agabus took the law and placed it in grace that was paul's job paul was the one who laid the word down paul was the one who brought the old testament into the new testament amen but that was paul's job agabus wasn't going to do it but even though paul was there god still had a gift that could raise up and prophesy and call for a world and say there's going to be a worldwide famine and it happened that's the important part it happened let's go over to acts 21. and verse eight and the next day we that were of paul's company departed and came into caesarea and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist which was one of the seven and abode with him and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy so this wasn't a weird thing in the new testament they come to his house and he's got daughters there that they prophesy amen praise be god and verse 10 you know i want to get to where we can say that common where that doesn't become weird for us but we can say hey that man's got daughters who prophesy and that's not a weird statement and that doesn't give anybody a a a scare or a fear but it becomes a normal part of our lives verse 10 and as we tarried there many days there came down from judea a certain prophet named agabus and when he was come unto us he took paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem then paul answered what me need to weep and to break my heart for i'm ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus so activist comes down and the apostle paul is there the prophet of the age but activist is a gift activist is the office of prophet in the church and he comes down and takes paul's girdle ties up his own hand and said this is what will happen to the man that owns the girdle and it happened so i mean it happened that's the important part it wasn't important that he said it what was important is that it happened because that's the office of a prophet now in the message demonology religious realm 1953 prophet says now you said well the prophets are the old testament oh no the new testament had prophets you believe that are we a new testament church we're going back to the book of acts church said agabus was a new testament prophet look at the spirit of prophecy falling down there and telling paul then then here come against down from jerusalem and found paul and tied his girdle around him and turned over and said thus saith the lord the man that wore this will be bound and chains when he gets to jerusalem agabus who stood up and told foretold what would take place he was a prophet not a man with the gift of prophecy see there's a difference let's turn to acts chapter 9. that's chapter 9 and verse 10 and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here lord and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth and he has seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight and ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man of how much evil he hath done to the saint of jerusalem and hear he hath authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost so god is speaking to ananias but but brother branham says here in questions and answers in 1964 said i believe paul the reason that he had to be baptized again is he persecuted the christians that's right god knew because i have chosen him he said to ananias the prophet so what if brother branham called ananias here he called him a prophet so ananias the prophet new testament book of acts prophet not just a gift of prophecy but a prophet he said ananias the prophet now go down to 1951 here our hope is in god now the sixth chapter in the eighth verse listen closely god never promised to bless my word but he promised to bless his word and now listen closely now as we're duplicating the day when this great man elisha who had a double portion of the spirit of elijah there never was in the age any two major prophets on the earth at the same time there were many minor prophets but there were one major prophet you got that there's only one major prophet there's only one prophet of the age there's only one brother branham but brother braden said many minor prophets remember when elijah was on the earth and elijah and elisha was walking together and and the manna was going to move from elijah to elisha elijah was the major prophet but then elijah was going to be the major prophet but as they were moving down to jericho to cross jericho amen they came in contact with the school of the prophets there was a group of prophets together and they prophesied and they knew what was going to happen they were prophesying that your master will be taken up today and elisha knew it he was a prophet too he said i know keep your peace so there was the school of the prophets but there was the major prophet in the days of elijah and elisha amen before this transpired elijah had already cursed ahab right he had already cursed he had to be already pronounced judgment on ahab he was the prophet of the age he was the major prophet amen but at the same time that he was still around amen when jehoshaphat came up to speak to ahab and they were going to join forces together to take back part of their land amen they called for a prophet and they had 400 but that wasn't good enough for jehoshaphat he needed one more and they brought makaya what was bacaya mackay was a prophet and mekiah prophesied amen he saw amen a whole conversation and a scene play out in heaven and brother brennan said he checked his vision with the prophecy because there was a major prophet on earth that had already foretold what would happen so the minor prophet has to check his prophecy with the major prophet of the age amen that makes sense so mechaia amen he was operating the office of a prophet but brother branham said he saw it he saw what took place but he said he had to check it with what elijah said if god raises up a prophet among us it's going to operate the same way it's got to be checked with what elijah said because that's the word that was restored in this day but yet mikaya was there yet mackay had an office yet makai was operating in it as a minor prophet but yet he was still a prophet yet he still saw what took place in heaven he told it and it happened that's the key it happened brother branham said in jehovah jireh in 1955 so now there's a difference between gift of prophecy and a prophet one is a gift of prophecy and the other one is a prophet a gift of prophecy must be judged by two or three spiritual men it can come upon one person tonight being another person tomorrow night and on another one the next night what it is is a gift in every local body a church but a prophet is different they are born a prophet and they come up prophets and all that they say must be true every time or it cannot be recognized as a prophet in the office you see that's a tight stipulation it's a difference between gift of prophecy and profit if it's a prophet all that they say must be true every time not hit or miss not once in a while every time or it cannot be recognized as a prophet in the office so you see it's different it's not a gift of prophecy it's the office of prophet and that's a person who's raised up with the gift of a prophet not many people who can catch something or catch something here catch them there have a spiritual dream and god give them an interpretation it's different they're constructed to be a prophet and like i said before with our brother rich it wasn't just a dream here or a dream there it wasn't a word of knowledge here or there but it was a dream with the word of the lord as an interpretation with an open vision with a life scenario that plays out then god wakes him up gives him the interpretation scenario and watches the same thing play out in the church exactly like it was foretold i've seen that happen so it's more than just a gift of prophecy friends god has raised up among us an office raised up among us a gift and and we have an opportunity to receive it or reject it and i for one want to receive what god sends when god sins god's responsible for watching over it god's not going to let it go awry god loves brother rich god loves you and i if we can stay together and stay in humility and have the proper understanding of what god's doing among us and can place it in the scriptures and place it in the message and stay together god will not let anything go awry god will keep it on track because he loves his bride and he doesn't want her to be deceived and god's given us enough word to know how to check it everything must happen every time so so god's not going to let his bride be taken this way or that way he's going to keep her on track we're in the final moments of this race and i've explained to you a little bit uh as best as i understand on second hand information how the gift has been operating but i said that so that you understand brother rich has no control over it he can't make a dream come he can't make an interpretation to a dream come he can't do anything he's just there and it happens sometimes things happen in clusters things events will happen close together and then there'll be nothing happen for months or nothing that he's aware of having from nuns and then maybe something happens he looks back and say something's been happening all along it's very unpredictable it's it's completely up to god it's god operating a gift it's not a man operating it and so i say that to say this it's not the kind of gift like brother branham had where you can go up to him and you can say you know where's my lost keys you know what i mean i don't want us to get the wrong understanding and i don't want to put the wrong kind of pressure on our brother we don't want to put any pressure brother bannon said brother brother neville had a gift of discernment and a gift of prophet to a gift of prophecy but he said the people were pushing pulling him in the air trying to get him to operate it you know and he had to correct brother neville and tell him not to do that amen so we've got to be careful this isn't it's not a mirror image of what brother branham was doing it's not even like brother abraham he's got a different gift it's not like you can go in and say you know has the lord showed you anything about me we don't want to be children we want to be mature we want to be solid we want to be stable we don't want to be childish we don't want to just take gifts and play with them we want to understand how god sends them they come in different diversity of gifts with different administrations and with different operations and we want to just watch and see how god uses our brother and how things come out amen and not push and not and not try to persuade and not be childish more than anything god has built us up to maturity and keeps growing us in maturity and he expects us if he's going to bring a gift he expects us to take it in maturity and be mature about it and so it's it's not it's not something that's frivolous and it's not it's not like it may not be like something you've ever seen operate before but it doesn't have to it can operate the way god wants it to operate but god has opened up another channel another office another way for him to speak to us and i for one am thankful god has is restoring even us as a local assembly he's bringing us back to the picture he had in the book of acts he's bringing us back to the fullness of the word amen and it was something he did in his time nobody pulled for it nobody pushed for it nobody tried to make it happen no man has anything to do with this and for that i'm especially thankful and so i want to have the right understanding that there's a gift among us if god wants to let us know something there's a gift among us we can be praying and i want to tell you now there there is a dream attached to a prophecy that has something to do that i know god wants to tell his bride before it happens i know that but i believe if we receive what god is giving us and we receive it by faith and we receive it in maturity and we say god would you give brother rich the interpretation of that dream i believe what we're doing here today amen is going to please the lord and i believe the lord is going to allow that to operate but we have to take it in maturity we all have to be responsible because it's one body with one purpose if god's raising up a gift it's not for that person to become a superman if god's raising up a gift it's for the edification of the body god doesn't raise up a ministry gift so that minister can be a superman that minister is the servant of all that's what minister means ministry means to serve and there's a fivefold ministry all of those offices are there to serve the body this is for the edification of the body this is for the building up and perfecting of the saints it's not for any man to get anything and i assure you i promise you out of all the men that i know that have stepped out in faith in an office god's got them i promise you it comes with a cost and our brother he'll he has to pay the price to bear that and i want you to pray for him i want you to pray for brother rich and for his family that god will keep him humble keep him tuned in keep him you know give him the right understanding helping to stay sensitive and and and help us to be sensitive and be mature and let us pray for one another and hold each other up and encourage one another and love one another god i believe this is there's just more to come i believe if we can approach this the right way there's more to come brother branham said in 1962 putting on the whole armor of god now golf forfeited his army i'm sorry god fortified that's a different meaning i need a drink i'm going to take a drink god fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was god doing listen did you ever think what the offices of the church is it's god's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer foresee before satan ever gets to it dunn told it what is it god dressed up in his church these offices is god's dress wear when you see those offices pastor teachers avengers what is that that's god's dress where god's presence god's spirit working through man 1963 questions and answers on the seals there's a question would the bride of christ would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture brother bram says sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of christ certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she's consists of apostle prophet teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it's so humble it'll be so humble what's the ministry of the bride consists of apostle prophets teaches pastors evangelists it'll be so humble it'll be a regular brother just a regular brother that you didn't expect a regular brother that there's something laying there that in due time god's going to draw it out he does the same thing when he calls a preacher a pastor or an evangelist or an apostle it's the same thing amen there's something there that god ordained to be there and in due time he brings it to the surface just a common brother just a regular person just somebody that you may not have expected before but all of a sudden god does it and when god does it god vindicates it i'm going to say when we were we met this past sunday for four and a half hours we learned and we heard the vindication we heard and and i wish that i could share with each one of you everything i heard but it's just too sensitive it'll cause too many problems but but but the brothers were with me and we heard and we saw the vindication we saw what god was doing and and with anticipation looking to what god will do and in my heart it was just a surreal moment i said if we can trust god if we can just trust god and not be timid and not be fearful not be timid every time we come to a new junction not be fearful every time something different happens but check it with the word and if it's in the word then let us move forward with faith that god's doing something not everything that's different wrong not everything that's different wrong not every junction not every junction is a disaster god's bringing his church higher and higher and higher and i personally believe there's more gifts to be mined out of this assembly but it's not going to be done by the effort of a man it's not going to be done by an intellectual deal it's going to be done by if we accept what god gives us now he'll give more and if you receive what god gives you he'll give more and if you receive but if you don't receive and you're too afraid to take it and you're too timid in what god's doing then you'll just sit right there until you can receive what god's giving but then when you receive what god giving he can give more and i want to be right where god is on the mark amen not ahead not behind not to the right not to the left but right on the mark we met like i said for four and a half hours i got home at 11 30 at night and i was exhausted because it was just emotional it was just overwhelming and it was long and you know then my wife waited up for me and i talked to her and was sharing with her some things that were going on and got in bed maybe 12 30 or 1 finally drifted off to sleep and i i woke up in the morning and these things are heavy on me you know it's one of those things you recognize this is a moment god's asking us to step up this is real something's happening and god wants us to be tuned in and aware and he wants us to step up and he wants us to accept what he's doing and i i realize it's a heavy moment not a bad moment but a heavy moment and i feel as a pastor i feel the weight the full gravity of the moment and and so i wake up in the morning and i go to pray and my wife and i we do devotions together every morning and brother abraham myra he sends out a little daily devotion every day with a scripture and a quote and he just grabs it off voice of god website the daily bread and then he adds another quote behind it and so like i said we were in this meeting we heard all these things we discussed these things get to bed that night 12 31 wake up seven in the morning and wake up my wife and we we sit down and i open up that thing brother abraham sent and the first scripture my eyes laid on that he sent to me i didn't go look it up said he that will receive a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward i said that's not coincidence that's just what me and the brothers talked about and that's just what we decided that we were going to receive what god was sending as god sent it receive it by faith and trust god he the receiver the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward brother branham said they asked him what's a prophet's reward he said it's to be the friend of a prophet well i was already brother rich's friend but i think it means more than that i think if you're the friend of the prophet what do you get prophecy to be the friend of the prophet is the one that gets to hear the prophecy and the question is do we want it do we want what god's giving us will we receive it by faith not fanaticism not immaturity not pushing or pulling not going too far this way but we'll receive what god's doing as god's doing and say god i see you're doing something i receive it by faith and when we pray for god to keep leading as a body can we pray and say god i see what you're doing i recognize it i receive it by faith and god i pray that you would you would watch over us that you would bless our brother rich that you would bless all the all the elders in the church you bless each one of us with the right approach and the right attitude and keep us marching forward right and step with your word will you pray that way we pray for brother rich and his family amen god is good friends it's amazing that we as a body of believers we've been through so much i mean so much and and for those of us have been around for any length of time we've been through so much and it's like god has never let us stay the same for the last five years he's never let us stay the same he's always brings a challenge and he asks us to rise up rise to the occasion he brings another challenge he brings a correction he brings an understanding he brings a teaching i mean it's it's non-stop constant it's a challenge it's a lifting up it's a challenge it's a lifting up it's a challenge to lifting up but i want to ask you how many of you are flying higher now than you've ever flown in your life why because god doesn't want us to stay the same we are not coasting like we are now all the way to the change in the body but we're going to be going higher and higher and higher and there's going to be more perfect manifestation of the entire body of christ this is not a one-man ministry anymore this is not just a few gifted people and everybody else watching it this is the whole body getting into position in every joint supplying and what we've seen temporarily we're going to see in the fullness fullness of its power [Applause] not by one man doing it not by a group of men doing it but the whole body is going to be every joint that supplies you could i can take my little finger like this and start bending it and you could say that fingers operating independent of the rest of the body and that's a lie because my heart has to beat my bone marrow has to make blood i every system in my body has to be working my nervous system my brain every function my lungs everything has to be working just to do that there's no independent action in the body every system is relying on every other system for every action and if we can operate it as a body then you'll see the finger move and the hand moving the leg everything will begin to function if we realize that i want to stay plugged in i want to i want to be a contributing part of the body amen and i want to be whatever system god has whatever place he has i want to be fully functioning so anything he wants to do he can do it there's no independent we're all individual members with an individual connection to god amen but that individual connection to god ties us and links us all together in an inseparable bond where we are mutually dependent on one another there is nobody that's not dependent on the rest of the body even though we're individuals with god with an individual relationship with god but that individual relationship is the glue that binds us together in one body in christ and that body has to function like a body and nobody's independent praise god i don't know about you but i'm excited i'm so glad god hasn't given us the privilege of just being a normal church we haven't been normal it seems like nothing's normal but i don't want to be normal i don't want to be what i've been i want to be what he wants me to be i still see more in the message i see more in the word of god more capabilities more untapped resources more potentials to be expressed i see more in the message do you see more in the message if i see more in the message then i'm not i'm not going to stay where i'm at god's got to give he's got to lift this bride into the full manifestation of everything that he spoke of her and i want to be right in time right in tune step in step with where he wants us to be let's all stand musicians if you could come brother ben if you could come up praise be to god i want to be a mature believer i want to grow up i want to have faith in what god's doing let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for all that you're giving to us lord in all that you're doing god we thank you lord for our brother rich for his faithfulness through the years for a steady consistency lord and god now that you're you're raising him up you're really beginning to display what's inside our brother what you've ordained god we pray that you'd protect him that you would shield him from every fiery dart how the enemy would love to take a gift like that and misuse it but you didn't raise it up to be misused you raise it up to edify your bride you raised it up to help us be in our position and to function fully and we just pray that you bless our brother let your anointing and inspiration be upon him and let him fully function in the capacity you've designed for him to function in bless his wife and his children and his family keep him encouraged lord as we pray that you'd watch over him and protect him and use him for your glory bless each one of us with a proper understanding let us each one lord come to an a mature understanding of what you're doing let our eyes be wide open and let us see what you're doing and catch it in time lord that we might be in step and in harmony with what you desire for us god this dream that our brother has had lord lord he's sensing that it's it's important and significant it's for the bride and it's for now and my spirit says the same thing lord and i just pray that you'd give our brother the interpretation of the dream that it before your bride lord that she might be edified that she might be lifted up she might be prepared she might have understanding god anything that anything that you want to do lord we want to give you the freedom to do it your way any gift you want to rise up among us lord we we want to get over our traditional understanding and quit relying on the past lord but help us just to look at your word and move forward any gift you want to rise up lord give us the faith and the understanding to receive it as you bring it lord god we believe that you'll do more than this because we see it in your word and god we're trusting in you to bring us help us to have the right response the right attitude and the right approach to what you're doing right now god we love you help us as an assembly stay humble lord let us stay humble lord and dependent on you and earnestly seeking you for every move that we should make i pray god that you would give me wisdom lord be on the wisdom of a human being god you've called me to be a pastor lord and no man can do it but you can do it lord this is your office and i pray god that you just protect us all lord and lead us all and guide us by your perfect will let your spirit have absolute liberty among us do what you desire to do have preeminence among us o god lord i pray for each saint
