[7:28] galatians chapter 3
[7:30] and we'll just launch right into the
[7:32] word
[7:33] amen thank god that we can be here
[7:36] together
[7:37] i pray appreciate the atmosphere i pray
[7:41] that god will have his way amongst us
[7:44] galatians chapter 3
[7:49] verse 7.
[7:54] galatians 3 and 7 will read
[7:58] now ye therefore know ye therefore that
[8:01] they which are faith
[8:03] the same are the children of abraham
[8:06] so how do you become a child of abraham
[8:08] by faith
[8:10] by faith and want by faith in the word
[8:12] amen that's what abraham believed and
[8:14] abraham didn't believe
[8:16] uh he didn't just believe any old word
[8:18] or anything
[8:19] he believed the present tense word amen
[8:22] when god spoke to him he believed it
[8:24] when god's word was when it was time for
[8:26] god's word to be made manifest in that
[8:28] hour
[8:28] amen it was told to abraham abraham
[8:30] received it and he believed it amen
[8:33] making him making god impute
[8:35] righteousness unto him because of his
[8:37] faith
[8:38] and making him the father of faith and
[8:40] so if we can believe the way abraham
[8:42] believed amen
[8:44] you realize it's not so much just
[8:46] believe the same thing abraham believed
[8:48] in a way it is because it's all the word
[8:50] but but it's believed the way
[8:52] abraham believed and how did abraham
[8:55] believe
[8:56] abraham believed the present tense truth
[8:58] amen
[8:59] making him the father of the faith
[9:01] praise be to god so let's keep reading
[9:04] you know therefore that they which are
[9:05] of faith the same or the children of
[9:07] abraham
[9:09] and the scripture foreseeing that god
[9:11] would justify the heathen through faith
[9:13] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[9:15] saying indeed shall all nations be
[9:17] blessed
[9:17] so then they which be of faith are
[9:20] blessed with faithful abraham
[9:23] amen you get the same blessing abraham
[9:25] gets if you can believe the same way
[9:26] abraham believed
[9:28] and let's bow our heads and pray lord
[9:30] jesus we ask your blessing over the
[9:31] reading of the word
[9:33] god i pray that you would come lord in
[9:35] your divine power
[9:37] by the anointing of your spirit lord you
[9:40] would take this vessel of clay lord and
[9:42] use it to preach your gospel
[9:44] i pray that you would hear through our
[9:46] ears lord and that that word would take
[9:48] root in our lives and
[9:49] bring forth fruit lord while we yield
[9:52] ourselves unto you we come now to hear
[9:54] from you and we pray you would speak
[9:55] clearly to us lord
[9:57] and may your children respond to your
[9:59] voice we ask your blessing over every
[10:01] part of this service that you would have
[10:02] preeminence
[10:04] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[10:07] you can all be seated let's stay in
[10:09] galatians in
[10:11] chapter 3 here and return over to verse
[10:13] 16.
[10:16] now to abraham and his seed were the
[10:18] promises made
[10:19] he saith not unto seeds as of many but
[10:22] as of one
[10:23] and to the seed which is christ this is
[10:26] such an essential scripture if we could
[10:28] just
[10:29] hang on to this for a minute and
[10:32] meditate on this for a moment
[10:33] sit down to abraham and his seed where
[10:36] the promise is made
[10:37] so so the promises are to abraham and to
[10:40] his seed
[10:42] which would be the seed line after him
[10:44] and brother ben tells us
[10:46] it is not his natural seed line not not
[10:49] isaac and and jacob and all of them but
[10:51] this is his
[10:52] faith seed amen abraham's seed which was
[10:54] faith
[10:56] and so now to abraham and his seed were
[10:58] the promise is made
[11:00] so now if you if you are faith amen you
[11:03] receive all the promises of faithful
[11:05] abraham if you're of faith
[11:06] amen so now to his seed where the
[11:08] promise is made
[11:10] he saith not and deceits as of many but
[11:12] as of one and to
[11:14] thy seed which is christ
[11:17] so christ was the seed of abraham
[11:20] amen so christ was that seed
[11:24] not seeds he's talking about not many
[11:26] he's not talking about many seeds or
[11:28] or or seed lines or diversity he's
[11:31] talking about one
[11:32] seed and that's the faith seed which is
[11:34] christ
[11:35] and all the promises are to that seed
[11:39] which is christ amen and if you have the
[11:41] faith
[11:42] like abraham had you are part of the
[11:45] promises that were to abraham and you
[11:47] become a child of abraham
[11:48] by the faith that abraham have and if
[11:50] you're a child of abraham you're part of
[11:52] that
[11:53] seed and that seed is christ
[11:57] not something else not something minor
[12:00] not something kind of like
[12:01] but it has to be the same thing
[12:04] romans 4 16. turn over the book of
[12:07] romans
[12:08] chapter 4. i want to lay in a few of
[12:12] these scriptures here
[12:14] and i got quite a few quotes i'd like to
[12:16] read
[12:18] if we can romans chapter 4
[12:21] verse 16.
[12:25] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[12:27] by grace
[12:28] to the end the promise might be sure to
[12:30] all the seed
[12:31] not to that only which is of the law but
[12:33] to that also which is of the faith of
[12:35] abraham
[12:36] who is the father of us all so is
[12:39] abraham your father
[12:42] amen that makes you abraham seed and
[12:44] abraham's seed was not seeds as many but
[12:46] as of one
[12:47] and abraham's seed is christ which is
[12:49] the faith seed
[12:50] and if you have the same faith amen
[12:52] you're part of the same seed
[12:55] praise god and that means all the
[12:57] promises that were given to abraham were
[12:58] given to you
[13:00] praise god colossians chapter 1.
[13:07] we know these scriptures well but it's
[13:09] just nice to lay them in right here in a
[13:11] foundation
[13:12] lay them in here together colossians
[13:16] chapter 1 verse 26.
[13:21] even the mystery which hath been hid
[13:24] from ages and from generations but now
[13:27] is made manifest to his saints to whom
[13:29] god would make known what is the riches
[13:31] of the glory of this mystery among the
[13:33] gentiles which
[13:34] is christ in you the hope of glory
[13:38] who in you christ in you what is christ
[13:41] he
[13:41] is the seed of abraham and where is the
[13:44] seed of abraham
[13:45] he's with the faithful he's with the
[13:47] children of abraham
[13:48] because that's the seed of abraham which
[13:50] is christ
[13:51] and now and now the great mystery amen
[13:54] that was hid from generations and ages
[13:57] is now made known
[13:58] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[14:02] oh i don't think we understand it right
[14:05] i don't think we can possibly comprehend
[14:07] it the way that it ought to be
[14:08] comprehended
[14:09] because if we comprehended it the way it
[14:11] ought to be comprehended then all of a
[14:13] sudden we would realize
[14:14] i have no problems amen everything is
[14:16] fine amen god has chosen me before the
[14:19] foundation of the world
[14:20] and chose me to be part of christ
[14:25] amen and if i'm part of that i'm part of
[14:28] that promise i'm part of that seed
[14:30] and then everything he promised to
[14:32] abraham which was an unconditional
[14:34] covenant everything that he promised
[14:37] abraham
[14:37] abraham's promise was not like adam's
[14:40] promise on condition if you will i will
[14:42] but it moved into an unconditional
[14:44] promise
[14:45] and he says i will and because he could
[14:47] swear by nothing greater he swore by
[14:48] himself that he would perform his oath
[14:51] and so now we've got a sure promise
[14:54] being part of this seed
[14:55] that god will perform what he promised
[14:57] amen the inheritance will come
[14:59] amen despite amen our conduct our
[15:02] conduct wasn't our conduct and merit
[15:05] wasn't obligatory for this promise this
[15:07] promise supersedes that
[15:10] because he made the promise on his own
[15:12] amen by his own merit
[15:14] and he swore by himself that he would do
[15:16] it regardless of what abraham did
[15:21] praise be to god that gives me a whole
[15:24] lot of hope and consolation
[15:26] now i titled this the supersede and
[15:29] i was reading the message uh last night
[15:32] or yesterday
[15:33] the super sign brother branham titled
[15:36] the super sign
[15:37] but it just struck me about the
[15:39] supersede and i just want to preach on
[15:41] that this morning by the grace of god
[15:43] brother branham says in the message the
[15:45] super sign and he preaches this at the
[15:46] end of 1963
[15:48] and it's november 29th it says oh god
[15:51] if the world could only see that that
[15:53] god and man are one
[15:56] the super sign the super sign when
[15:58] brother man is preaching super sign
[16:00] what's the super sign the super sign was
[16:02] the first man that god could come into
[16:04] all that god was he poured into christ
[16:07] now brother rem doesn't stop there
[16:09] he's talking about the super sign all
[16:10] that god was he poured into christ
[16:12] and all christ was he poured into the
[16:14] church super sign
[16:17] god and man together what is the super
[16:20] sign
[16:20] the super sign is god and man together
[16:24] oh praise god god and man
[16:27] together that was to be the super sign
[16:30] of the last day
[16:31] when the entire bible was to be
[16:33] fulfilled in the last days
[16:35] what was to be fulfilled in the last
[16:36] days malachi 4 revelation no the entire
[16:39] bible
[16:41] you realize brother man was not saying
[16:43] you know it's just this verse in this
[16:44] verse and we know the verses that apply
[16:46] to the day and age we live in we can
[16:48] pull them up amen and we talk about luke
[16:50] 17 30 and malachi 4.
[16:52] amen we talk about revelations 10 1-7
[16:56] but but friends brother brennan said in
[16:57] the end time amen it's to be the
[16:59] manifestation of the entire bible
[17:02] because the entire bible is one story
[17:04] one goal
[17:05] one purpose that god had in his mind and
[17:08] he's been letting it out down through
[17:09] generations and down through the old
[17:11] testament amen to
[17:12] finally let it out let it out let it out
[17:14] until finally there was a man
[17:16] standing on earth that encompassed all
[17:18] that word
[17:20] and then from him was taking a portion
[17:22] amen that he could have a bride amen and
[17:24] over
[17:25] through the new testament he was letting
[17:26] it out building it up building it up
[17:28] building up
[17:28] until finally amen he would declare that
[17:31] she's on earth and the headstone now
[17:33] will come to unite with that bride
[17:35] that's the whole bible the whole purpose
[17:37] of the bible
[17:38] is god amen god god god
[17:41] god moving into flesh amen expressed as
[17:44] male and female united
[17:46] as one and put back into eden again so
[17:49] the end time
[17:50] is when he's going to fulfill all the
[17:53] word
[17:55] when the entire bible was to be
[17:57] fulfilled in the last days
[18:00] a super sign a virgin shall conceive
[18:04] and this conception when it's brought
[18:05] forth will be god manifested in the
[18:07] flesh a super sign
[18:09] they still don't believe it but it was
[18:10] anyhow it's still
[18:12] a super sign no to super sign they've
[18:15] got superman today they got
[18:16] fictions of superman all these other
[18:18] kind of super things
[18:20] but the church has got a super sign god
[18:22] back in the church
[18:24] manifesting in human flesh god united
[18:26] with man
[18:27] his sure super sign
[18:31] his sure super sign notice the eternal
[18:33] sign an
[18:34] unfailing sign it will never fail man
[18:37] and the word and man becoming one when
[18:40] god's word and man become one
[18:42] as saint john the first chapter says in
[18:44] the beginning was the word
[18:45] and the word was with god and the word
[18:47] was god and the word was made flesh and
[18:49] dwelt among us
[18:50] that's the super sign the super sign
[18:54] is when the word amen when the word
[18:58] is made flesh and dwells among us
[19:04] and we can see that amen in jesus christ
[19:07] amen when he come on earth the word was
[19:08] made flesh and dwell among
[19:10] us that was a super sign but when that
[19:12] prophet was here on the scene
[19:13] amen that was the word made flesh what
[19:16] word
[19:17] luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 amen malachi
[19:20] 4 it was the very word of god amen that
[19:23] was materialized amen through the flesh
[19:26] of a human being
[19:27] amen and when that word was being
[19:29] fleshed out
[19:30] luke 17 30 was being demonstrated and
[19:33] fleshed out
[19:34] amen that was a super sign it was god
[19:37] and man the word and men
[19:38] becoming one and manifesting the word
[19:41] was the super sign
[19:45] it's an eternal sign an unfailing sign
[19:48] the word and man becoming one
[19:52] oh if that was the super sign of that
[19:54] day when that same spirit that was on
[19:56] jesus christ comes into his church to
[19:58] manifest the written word for today
[20:00] that is still the super sign
[20:04] friends it's still the super sign amen
[20:06] there's no
[20:07] i mean there's no uh if we want to see a
[20:10] super sign
[20:11] there's no pointing back to something
[20:12] else amen because there's a super sign
[20:14] on earth today
[20:17] let's just keep going and talk about
[20:19] this for a little bit
[20:21] the same message that prophets prophets
[20:24] are the chief sign
[20:26] god's chief sign is a prophet and i'm
[20:28] going to speak a few minutes about that
[20:30] they are his word made manifest for the
[20:32] age
[20:33] and that's the reason the prophet is
[20:34] always god's chief sign
[20:36] he has never sent a judgment upon the
[20:37] earth without first sending a prophet
[20:39] you see and search the scriptures a
[20:41] prophet is the chief sign of god to his
[20:44] people
[20:44] that he has sent this person this
[20:46] certain person like noah
[20:47] like moses like elijah and the prophets
[20:50] he sends them to manifest the word for
[20:52] that age
[20:53] to give his people a warning so the the
[20:56] chief sign
[20:57] amen is is a prophet i mean we saw that
[21:00] chief sign
[21:01] and john the baptist when he came as a
[21:03] prophet to announce the forerunning of
[21:05] jesus christ
[21:07] and brother branham now became a chief
[21:09] sign to the age amen because he came to
[21:11] fulfill the word to take the word and
[21:13] make it live
[21:13] he became the word in this age
[21:17] what word luke 17 30 the revealing of
[21:20] the son of man
[21:23] what word uh revelation 10 7 in the days
[21:26] of the voice of the seventh angel
[21:27] what word he actually took the word and
[21:29] took it on flash
[21:31] and fleshed out the word
[21:34] and that was a sign to this age
[21:39] and so in the same message super sign
[21:42] i'm going to read several quotes out of
[21:43] this message
[21:44] as we build this platform so watch let's
[21:46] take the path
[21:48] of abraham just for a moment a type of
[21:50] his seed
[21:51] abraham the prophet watch god had spoken
[21:53] to him in many ways
[21:56] since he had left the chaldea the city
[21:58] of ur he had traveled along and god had
[22:00] showed him many great signs
[22:01] appeared to him showed him all kinds of
[22:03] things that would happen
[22:04] told him what would take place all these
[22:06] things he has told him
[22:08] but before he received his promised son
[22:10] he was standing near the gates of the
[22:12] gentiles just above sodom
[22:14] and before he received his super son or
[22:16] a son that was to be born a super son of
[22:18] course
[22:19] before he received him not the royal one
[22:20] now but before he received him
[22:22] he received the super sign what was it
[22:26] god came down to him in the form of a
[22:28] man notice that
[22:29] man that talked with him that stood at
[22:31] the tent where he was at performed a
[22:33] super sign
[22:34] and when his super son came on the scene
[22:36] his super son performed the same sign
[22:38] to show that he was abraham's supersede
[22:41] glory
[22:42] and he promised the same thing in the
[22:44] last days do you see what i mean
[22:46] abraham before just before the promised
[22:49] son arrived
[22:50] as we're looking for now abraham's seed
[22:52] royal seed
[22:53] that was the natural seed this is the
[22:55] royal seed when the natural seed got
[22:57] their sign they rejected it
[22:59] so have we nothing but the royal seed
[23:01] still the church seed
[23:03] will still reject it again so when it
[23:06] come time
[23:07] for abraham to receive the promise
[23:10] remember we're benefactors of every
[23:13] promise abraham would receive
[23:16] and so he had a promise he was going to
[23:18] receive a promised son
[23:20] amen but before he could receive that
[23:22] promised son there had to be a super
[23:24] sign
[23:25] given and that super sign would be when
[23:27] god would come down himself
[23:29] and he would take material of the earth
[23:31] and he would build out of it
[23:32] a body a man that he could step into and
[23:35] brother baby said this man ate and this
[23:37] man drank and this man had dust on his
[23:39] feet
[23:40] abraham watched his feet he said it was
[23:42] a man amen he made a body a man
[23:45] and he came down into the flesh of a man
[23:47] and he stood there amen before abraham
[23:50] and what was the sign he showed he
[23:52] showed the sign of the messiah
[23:54] amen by discerning the thoughts of sarah
[23:56] and the tent behind him
[23:59] amen and so the the pattern is laid out
[24:01] amen before the super
[24:03] and before the promise can be fulfilled
[24:06] there had to be a super sign that come
[24:07] first
[24:08] and the super sign that came first was
[24:10] god and man
[24:11] becoming one
[24:15] now see god in that day elohim
[24:18] he didn't have a body that he could work
[24:21] through like that
[24:22] amen so he had the first he had to
[24:24] create a temporary body
[24:27] this was a temporary body he came to
[24:30] abraham in
[24:30] because after he left he said that body
[24:32] just went back to the elements of the
[24:34] earth
[24:34] it was a temporary body that he came in
[24:37] amen because the way hadn't been paved
[24:39] yet for god to come into human flesh
[24:42] but the next time amen that he was going
[24:45] to come and show a super sign
[24:47] it was going to be when jesus christ
[24:49] came on the earth amen in that body
[24:51] amen was a virgin born body there was no
[24:54] sin in that body
[24:55] and when he was born now there was a
[24:57] body that elohim could dwell in
[25:00] and now he come now he came
[25:04] and this time he showed another super
[25:06] sign
[25:07] and he showed the sign of god and man
[25:09] becoming one
[25:10] amen but now it was a body that had been
[25:13] birthed through a
[25:14] woman first it was a body that was
[25:17] created by the hand of god temporary
[25:19] faded away next it was a body that was
[25:21] created in the womb of mary amen that
[25:23] was actually birth he birthed his own
[25:25] body
[25:26] that he could live in a virgin birth a
[25:28] sinless birth
[25:29] he meant so that he could dwell in that
[25:31] and that vessel would become that it
[25:33] would be the lamb of god
[25:35] that would take away the sins of the
[25:36] world amen and so now
[25:38] at the end of time he promised that same
[25:41] thing would repeat again
[25:42] only now the work of redemption has so
[25:45] thoroughly been done
[25:47] that he can take a sin-born body of
[25:49] flesh
[25:51] and he can do the same thing god did and
[25:54] a
[25:54] hand handmade body of flesh had that
[25:57] handmade body of flesh that god made
[25:59] hadn't sinned amen hadn't been born
[26:02] hybrid hadn't come of a man of a woman
[26:04] he brought it up so he could dwell in it
[26:06] temporarily so that he could show the
[26:08] super sign
[26:09] amen and then he could leave and that
[26:10] body would go back to the elements
[26:12] but the next one would be virgin born
[26:14] amen having no sin so he could live in
[26:16] it
[26:16] but that virgin-born body would pay the
[26:19] price for
[26:20] all the rest of the seed
[26:23] and then at the end of time to prove how
[26:26] thoroughly he has redeemed his children
[26:28] amen god would do the same thing he did
[26:31] on the planet
[26:32] uh before abraham and sarah he would do
[26:35] the same thing that he did in jesus
[26:36] christ
[26:37] now he would do it the same thing from a
[26:39] man that was born in sin
[26:42] shaped in iniquity come through
[26:44] hybridization amen born
[26:46] amen in the lowly hills of kentucky why
[26:48] what's he showing he's showing how
[26:50] thorough the redemption is the
[26:52] super sign down is the same thing that
[26:54] it was when abraham here
[26:55] it was the same thing in jesus christ
[26:57] it's the same thing that's repeated
[26:59] again in this generation
[27:00] and it's proving the redemption process
[27:03] is complete
[27:07] oh hallelujah
[27:10] that should give us a whole lot of
[27:12] courage friends
[27:15] there was no body no physical body
[27:18] for elohim to step into when abraham was
[27:21] here
[27:23] when jesus came he had to come sinless
[27:26] but birth through a woman
[27:28] so that there was a body he could step
[27:29] into
[27:32] but through the process of redeeming his
[27:34] bride
[27:35] when he comes to the end of time he's
[27:38] going to do the same thing
[27:39] it's been done three times
[27:43] elohim and a handmade body
[27:47] elohim and a sinless birth body
[27:52] elohim in a hybrid body born in sin
[27:59] to show the super sign the super sign
[28:03] declaring the full power of redemption
[28:11] let's keep moving forward
[28:16] he says now watch the super sign god
[28:19] come down in the form of a man and
[28:20] performed a sign and his back turned to
[28:22] the tent
[28:23] and asked where sarah was and abraham
[28:25] said she's in the tent behind you
[28:27] now remember the gentiles were fixing to
[28:30] be burned just like it
[28:31] it is now the gentile world is to be
[28:33] destroyed by fire we know that
[28:35] so he come down amen brother baby says
[28:37] there was three angels that came down
[28:40] took on bodies of flesh amen as elohim
[28:42] and two angels
[28:43] and and one stayed with abraham the
[28:45] called out group
[28:46] amen but two and he types him with he
[28:49] shows them as
[28:49] oral roberts and billy graham went down
[28:52] into sodom and blinded them by the
[28:53] gospel amen brother ben was so clearly
[28:56] identifying
[28:57] the the the type in the shadow where
[28:59] we're at in time by laying it all out
[29:01] amen they're right there sodom in the
[29:03] sodom condition
[29:04] god coming down to judge sodom amen and
[29:07] it's repeated again in this day
[29:10] he says it says look at the track of the
[29:12] church it's coming up through luther
[29:13] through wesley through pentecost
[29:15] denominations
[29:16] we've had revelations and other kinds of
[29:18] things we've had speaking in tongues
[29:20] we've had gifts of healing
[29:21] we've had every manifest everything
[29:23] manifested
[29:24] but look right at the end time before
[29:27] the burning and the destroying
[29:28] the super sign mysteriously appears
[29:31] mysteriously
[29:32] right on the scene again before us amen
[29:35] god himself
[29:36] not a man but god made manifest a super
[29:39] sign
[29:40] an everlasting sign an eternal sign
[29:43] a super sign god manifested in the flesh
[29:47] same signs that his son did his super
[29:49] son promised the same at the end
[29:51] as it was in the days of sodom so shall
[29:54] it be at the coming of the son of man
[29:56] the super sign will return
[30:00] you know brother ben's preaching he's
[30:01] preaching the super sign
[30:04] and he's preaching this and he's laying
[30:05] it out and it's not a long message he's
[30:07] laying
[30:07] out in shreveport and he's calling out
[30:09] to them to shake themselves away
[30:10] wake up to the hour that we're in he
[30:12] says you've been good to me
[30:14] you've fed me amen you fed my children
[30:16] you've clothed my children
[30:17] he says but you've got to wake up and
[30:19] recognize what's going on
[30:21] and he's laying it out so plain
[30:24] he's saying there was two that went
[30:25] there they were right there at the time
[30:27] at the end of the gentile world and
[30:29] sodom
[30:29] and gomorrh were going to be born burned
[30:32] and jesus christ said
[30:33] amen that day amen so shall it be as it
[30:36] was in sodom so and lot's day so shall
[30:38] it be
[30:39] amen at the revealing of the son of man
[30:42] he said what will he do he'll show a
[30:44] super sign again
[30:45] what he did then he'll do again and
[30:47] brother bam comes to the end of the
[30:49] sermon and he starts the discernment
[30:50] which is the sign of the messiah
[30:52] amen and he says so you'll know he said
[30:54] i'll turn my back
[30:56] he starts calling out people in the
[30:58] balcony and calling out people over here
[30:59] calling out people over here
[31:01] why he's trying to wake them up to the
[31:03] fact that the super sign is here
[31:05] amen god and man is connected again like
[31:08] he was
[31:09] when elohim came to abraham like he was
[31:11] when jesus christ was on the earth
[31:14] anything how how in the world can that
[31:17] be because we're come to the end of
[31:19] redemption for the gentile pride
[31:21] amen she's come through the cycle of
[31:22] redemption she's been purified and
[31:25] washed by the watering of the word amen
[31:27] so that he could come down
[31:28] and connect in such a way to prove amen
[31:32] that to prove the day and age that we
[31:34] live in
[31:36] praise be to god
[31:43] he says the super sign will return
[31:47] and the message this day the scripture
[31:49] is fulfilled
[31:50] it says that was the royal seat of
[31:52] abraham and here that royal seat of
[31:54] abraham
[31:55] which came because of that
[31:56] identification of that man sitting there
[31:58] with abraham come to prove it was the
[32:01] same god
[32:01] promised in this day as it was in the
[32:04] days of sodom so shall it be in the
[32:06] coming of the son of man
[32:07] when he is revealing himself as son of
[32:10] man this is the day for this scripture
[32:12] to be fulfilled
[32:16] brother man is making it clear this is
[32:18] the day
[32:19] for that scripture to be fulfilled when
[32:22] he says
[32:23] he says as it was in sodom this is what
[32:25] brother bram says as it was in the days
[32:27] of sodom
[32:28] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[32:29] of man when when he
[32:31] is revealing himself the son of man so i
[32:34] want you to see
[32:35] as as brother bram says over and over
[32:37] and over again
[32:38] you can connect the revealing of the son
[32:40] of man luke 17
[32:41] 30 the revealing of the son of man is
[32:45] the coming of the son of man
[32:47] it is his coming the coming of the son
[32:50] of man
[32:51] he comes and reveals himself
[32:54] the coming of the son of man is the
[32:56] revealing of the son of man
[32:58] amen you can't reveal who's not come
[33:04] and so brother branham is standing there
[33:06] showing
[33:07] amen that was what was in that man that
[33:10] talked to abraham
[33:12] is now come
[33:15] what was there in jesus christ amen when
[33:18] he met the woman
[33:19] in samaria by the well and said hey you
[33:22] know
[33:22] go and get your husband and she says i i
[33:25] you know she says i don't have a husband
[33:27] he says you've told the truth you've had
[33:28] five and the one you're with now
[33:30] is not your own amen what's he doing
[33:32] brother baby showing that same life
[33:34] amen that same elohim that was in that
[33:36] body of flesh
[33:37] is now in this body of flesh
[33:41] doing the same sign and brother man says
[33:43] you know that's not me he said a man
[33:45] can't do these things he said i don't
[33:46] know you're a perfect stranger to me who
[33:48] did you touch you didn't touch me you
[33:50] touched him
[33:51] who's him it's the son of man
[33:54] the revealing of the son of man is the
[33:56] coming of the son of man
[34:00] they are linked together
[34:03] and so we see the super sign
[34:07] of his presence the super sign of his
[34:09] coming
[34:12] brother bram says again in the super
[34:14] sign
[34:16] he says now you all can't be that one
[34:19] he's talking about the prophet he's
[34:22] talking about
[34:23] that that super sign of elohim speaking
[34:26] through flesh giving the sign of the
[34:28] messiah
[34:29] he said now you all can't be that one
[34:31] but you can be part of that with your
[34:33] faith
[34:35] i'm part of it i'm absolutely part of it
[34:39] amen
[34:40] because that amen that oh
[34:45] that revealing of the son of man showing
[34:48] the coming of the son of man
[34:50] amen was a part of brother ben's
[34:53] ministry was that of john the baptist to
[34:55] forerun his second coming
[34:57] is that true the four won his second
[35:00] coming
[35:00] amen but the second coming amen was so
[35:04] mysterious
[35:05] that the second coming came amen and
[35:08] demonstrated itself in the same vessel
[35:10] that was declaring his coming
[35:13] so when john the baptist was here
[35:14] declaring his coming amen when he come
[35:17] he come in another vessel and that
[35:19] vessel declared
[35:21] john's ministry to be correct
[35:24] but in the end time the one declaring is
[35:27] coming
[35:28] amen that that coming of the lord will
[35:30] also come down in demonstration and
[35:32] manifestation
[35:33] through the forerunner and prove what
[35:35] the forerunner was telling
[35:38] that's what the sign of the messiah does
[35:40] it's nothing more than jesus christ
[35:42] in flesh
[35:45] so now you all can't be that one but you
[35:48] can be part of that with your faith
[35:50] why am i part of that because that
[35:52] demonstration
[35:53] amen of the son of man coming the son of
[35:56] man coming did not stop
[35:58] with brother branham but he came and how
[36:00] did he come
[36:01] he come to unite with the bride
[36:04] he come amen this this second coming the
[36:07] coming of the son of man
[36:09] amen we see it and brother branham typed
[36:11] out demonstrated perfectly beautiful
[36:14] showing that he is here
[36:17] but when brother branham left amen the
[36:19] son of man didn't leave
[36:20] amen the son of man the purpose of of
[36:23] elijah coming
[36:24] was an eleazer ministry amen to take and
[36:27] unite
[36:28] isaac with rebecca to bring the two
[36:30] together
[36:31] so that what so that it can reveal the
[36:33] son of man again
[36:35] that's improving his word so how am i
[36:37] part of it i'm part of it because that
[36:39] son of man
[36:40] amen has come down to unite with the
[36:42] bride to be
[36:44] amen the bride coming of christ
[36:47] he's already come
[36:50] in his flesh body as husband
[36:55] and now he's come to be demonstrated in
[36:58] the body of his bride
[37:01] just like adam and eve adam had already
[37:05] come
[37:05] and adam was eve he had already come he
[37:08] had already had manifestations on the
[37:10] earth
[37:10] amen but god was going to lay adam down
[37:13] and pull apart
[37:14] out of adam and he was going to form
[37:15] amen the wife of adam the bride of adam
[37:18] misses
[37:18] adam i mean she was going to be upon the
[37:22] earth amen
[37:23] then he was going to rise up adam again
[37:25] and unite the two together
[37:26] what was the woman she was just a
[37:29] further expression of adam she was
[37:31] adam he was adam she was adam
[37:34] what was inside of her adam what was she
[37:37] made out of
[37:38] adam what life was in her adam what
[37:41] spirit was in her
[37:41] adam praise be to god
[37:46] that's how i'm identified with when i
[37:48] see that super sign
[37:49] that super sign indicates that there's a
[37:51] super seed
[37:53] and i'm part of that supersede i don't
[37:55] have to replicate what brother brenham
[37:57] did
[37:58] i'm part of it by faith because it was
[38:00] here proving there's a supersede on
[38:02] earth and i'm part of that super seed
[38:06] that super race brother bam says
[38:14] now i'll finish reading this quote
[38:15] before we move on now you all can't be
[38:17] that one but you can be part of that
[38:18] with your faith all of them couldn't be
[38:21] jesus
[38:22] when they was on earth but they could
[38:24] believe him and accept the message
[38:26] there was one moses one elijah one noah
[38:28] on down always been that
[38:30] but the rest of them could accept it and
[38:32] they could have had no ministry unless
[38:34] there had been somebody believe it
[38:36] jesus would have had no ministry unless
[38:38] somebody believed it paul would have had
[38:40] no ministry unless somebody believed it
[38:41] the holy ghost has got no ministry by
[38:43] the word today unless somebody is
[38:45] willing
[38:46] to get away from their creed and come
[38:48] back to the word again
[38:50] i'm part of it by faith and the message
[38:53] of modern events made
[38:54] are made clear by prophecy it says jesus
[38:58] when he when he come he was to be a
[39:01] prophet
[39:02] that's right and today before jesus
[39:04] comes again the full manifestation of
[39:07] the purpose of jesus christ is to be
[39:08] made manifest in flesh
[39:10] think of it as it was in the days of
[39:13] sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[39:14] the son of man
[39:15] when the son of man is being revealed
[39:17] did you catch it
[39:18] let's read it slowly as it was in the
[39:21] days of sodom and
[39:22] sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[39:25] the son of man
[39:26] when the son of man is being revealed so
[39:29] the coming of the son of man is the day
[39:31] the son of man is being revealed
[39:35] praise god has the son of man been
[39:39] revealed
[39:41] has the son of man come this is the
[39:43] coming of the son of man
[39:46] and he's still coming but what form is
[39:48] he coming in
[39:49] he's coming in bride form and what is
[39:52] the bride form supposed to do
[39:54] reveal the son of man praise god
[40:01] what is revealed unfolded made known
[40:04] the secret had been brought forth
[40:06] revealed in the day that the son of man
[40:08] will be revealed
[40:09] the world will be in a sodom condition
[40:12] we've got it haven't we
[40:13] oh how many believes that in a sodom
[40:15] condition and that's exactly right look
[40:17] where it's sitting now
[40:18] remember there's always three groups of
[40:20] people and every bunch of people you
[40:21] gather
[40:22] that's make believers unbelievers and
[40:24] believers we have there in every group
[40:26] they have them
[40:27] they had them all in all time there was
[40:30] the sodomites there was the loddites
[40:32] and there was abraham and abraham was a
[40:34] called out group and he
[40:36] wasn't in sodom to begin with now watch
[40:38] their message
[40:39] they had been looking for a promised son
[40:41] looking for it for years
[40:43] god had showed abraham many great signs
[40:45] and wonders
[40:46] but here god came down himself like a
[40:49] man
[40:50] you said that was an angel abraham
[40:51] called him lord capital l-o-r-d
[40:54] and any reader of the bible knows that
[40:55] the capital l-o-r-d is elohim
[40:57] in the beginning god lord god elohim the
[41:00] all-sufficient one
[41:01] abraham call him the lord god elohim now
[41:04] notice there was two people that went
[41:06] down into sodom with the message
[41:08] and they preached the sodomites they
[41:09] didn't perform nothing but blinded them
[41:11] which preaching the gospel does blind
[41:13] the unbeliever
[41:15] but watch what kind of sign the abraham
[41:17] group received
[41:18] now we are supposed to be the royal seed
[41:20] of abraham
[41:22] isaac was the natural seed but the faith
[41:24] seed
[41:25] the faith in the promised word the
[41:26] promised word don't miss it
[41:28] was that royal seed that was the seed
[41:32] the promised word was the royal seed
[41:34] amen it's always been the word the royal
[41:36] seed is the word
[41:38] amen christ is what the word amen god is
[41:42] the word christ is the word
[41:43] the bride is the word the royal seed is
[41:47] the word amen christ is the word
[41:51] the word is god
[41:54] praise be to god was the royal seed that
[41:58] was
[41:58] that was the seed abraham's faith
[42:02] i want to go back and read that slow
[42:04] because at first it's easy to miss
[42:07] we are supposed to be the royal seed of
[42:09] abraham
[42:11] isaac was the natural seed but the face
[42:12] seed the faith in the promised word
[42:15] the promised word don't miss it was the
[42:17] royal seed that was the seed
[42:19] abraham's faith what was the seed
[42:23] abraham's faith faith
[42:26] in the promised word of god produced the
[42:28] seed
[42:30] we being dead in christ we're abraham's
[42:33] seed
[42:35] heirs with him according to the promise
[42:38] abraham's seed is
[42:40] christ and we are
[42:43] abraham seed are you abraham's seed
[42:48] abraham seed is christ we're abraham's
[42:52] seed
[42:54] we are christ
[42:58] that's a big statement to make but when
[43:00] you recognize
[43:01] it's not the hybridization we're talking
[43:03] about it's not the birth from natural
[43:05] parents we're talking about
[43:06] but it's that seed that gene of god that
[43:09] attribute of god down on the inside that
[43:11] is the word
[43:12] of god and that word of god has got to
[43:14] come into manifestation in this age
[43:16] and it's got to manifest what it was
[43:18] spoke for what it was placed for amen
[43:20] when god had a thought in his mind that
[43:23] thought had a purpose amen and that
[43:25] thought a word
[43:26] is a thought expressed so that means
[43:29] that attribute that's laying in us
[43:30] was a thought that was in god's mind and
[43:33] that thought was something he wanted to
[43:35] express
[43:37] the thought amen was something that
[43:39] needed an expression
[43:40] amen when it was expressed that's the
[43:42] word
[43:45] so what are the believers the word in
[43:47] the book what book the lamb's book of
[43:50] life
[43:52] who's the lamb christ so the lamb's book
[43:56] of life
[43:58] who are the believers the words written
[44:00] in the book
[44:02] that means we are the word the thought
[44:05] of god
[44:06] something god wanted to portray
[44:09] something god
[44:10] wanted to manifest was his thought amen
[44:12] so he recorded it
[44:14] in the lamb's book of life
[44:18] or i'll rephrase it and hopefully you
[44:21] don't think i'm sacrilegious
[44:23] the book of life of the lamb
[44:27] male and female your marriage
[44:30] certificate
[44:31] your book of redemption the record of
[44:34] the royal seed
[44:35] the book of christ
[44:40] the lamb's book of life the record
[44:44] coming forth of the seed
[44:49] again in super sign it says
[44:52] watch watch what the bible said
[44:56] what is the super sign is the word made
[44:59] manifest in every age
[45:00] is that right well why couldn't they
[45:03] believe jesus
[45:04] when hebrews 4 said the word of god is
[45:05] quicker more powerful than a two-edged
[45:07] sword cutting asunder
[45:08] that is when it's preached in its power
[45:10] it cuts right and left two edge cuts
[45:13] both ways what is it cuts plum to the
[45:15] morrow of the bone
[45:16] and what else does it do discerns the
[45:18] thoughts
[45:19] in the heart they couldn't believe him
[45:22] but he was discerning the thoughts in
[45:23] their hearts
[45:26] they they didn't want to believe the
[45:27] manifestation in this day coming through
[45:29] that prophet that forerunner amen they
[45:31] wouldn't believe it but he was
[45:32] discerning the thoughts of their heart
[45:34] but i want to bring it on down home
[45:36] because it's the word the word
[45:38] is a discerner of the thoughts intents
[45:40] of the heart and how many times have you
[45:42] sat in service here and had your
[45:44] thoughts discerned by the word
[45:48] what is it showing it shows that the
[45:49] supersede is here and the super sign is
[45:52] still here
[45:53] amen only it's not going to be one man
[45:55] and a prophetic ministry
[45:56] turning us back to the crowd it's going
[45:58] to be a man with no gift of discernment
[46:01] that has no idea what you're going
[46:03] through
[46:03] amen but we'll just take the inspiration
[46:05] of the word and the word will come down
[46:08] and be a discerner of the thoughts and
[46:10] intents in your heart
[46:11] and in your life and the discussion you
[46:13] had last night and the conversation you
[46:15] had with your wife this morning
[46:17] and the very thing that you've been
[46:18] hiding from everybody else and then god
[46:20] will come and bring his word
[46:21] and cut and separate the morrow and the
[46:23] bone
[46:25] and discern between the thoughts and the
[46:26] intents of the heart what is it
[46:28] it's the super seed it's this royal seed
[46:31] amen it's the word
[46:32] made manifest it's the same discernment
[46:35] that was there
[46:36] in another form
[46:40] why because the word is the discerner
[46:43] if we really catch that the word is a
[46:45] discerner and he is the word and the
[46:47] bride is the manifestation of the word
[46:49] she's united with the word
[46:52] and now she's preaching the word and its
[46:54] power
[46:56] and preaching the word and its power is
[46:58] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[46:59] the heart
[47:02] if we could catch it we would quit
[47:04] chasing after gifts
[47:08] we would quit looking for somebody to
[47:09] solve my problems somebody
[47:11] to fix this and so somebody to rise on
[47:13] the scene that can tell me all my
[47:15] problems
[47:15] we would quit looking for that and we
[47:16] would sit down and say god you have
[47:18] opened the book in this day
[47:20] you have given us your word amen and
[47:21] you're here amen you're here in your
[47:24] fullness amen to bring us the word
[47:26] i have a need there's something in my
[47:27] life and nobody else knows it but you're
[47:30] still the discerner of the thoughts and
[47:32] intents of the heart
[47:33] if you are the word and you're the
[47:34] living word and you're living in your
[47:36] bride
[47:36] then i can hear amen that word coming
[47:39] through your bride
[47:41] and the evidence that you're here is
[47:43] that word will discern
[47:45] my thoughts and intents in my heart
[47:48] that word amen will repeat the
[47:50] conversation in the king's bed
[47:52] chamber back to him again
[47:56] see god's doing it in such a way we
[47:59] can't all be that one
[48:01] we can't all be the moses we can't all
[48:03] be the jesus but we can believe it by
[48:05] faith
[48:05] but god in the transition he moved from
[48:08] forerunner and to the thing he
[48:10] forerunned which was the bride coming of
[48:11] christ
[48:12] and brother branham said well the bride
[48:13] they asked brother ben will the bride
[48:14] have a ministry he said of course of a
[48:16] ministry it's a great ministry it's
[48:18] going on now and it consists of apostles
[48:20] prophets teachers evangelist pastors
[48:24] and if we have the right attitude
[48:26] towards the word of god
[48:28] we realize it's not a man it's not this
[48:30] man
[48:31] that man this other man i mean forget
[48:33] the names it doesn't matter it's got to
[48:35] be the word
[48:37] we're going to look past the man amen
[48:39] and see that that's a vessel chosen of
[48:41] god to bring the word and the word is a
[48:43] discerner of thought
[48:44] the word is my husband the word is my
[48:46] headship the word is what i need
[48:51] brother branham came he showed exactly
[48:53] what was showed to abraham
[48:55] he came and he showed exactly what was
[48:58] demonstrated
[48:59] through jesus christ proving that the
[49:02] son of man was here
[49:05] but something else happened next
[49:10] let's go to isaiah chapter seven
[49:15] keep moving through this as we work our
[49:18] way down
[49:19] isaiah chapter 7.
[49:39] therefore the lord himself shall give
[49:41] you a sign
[49:43] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[49:45] a son
[49:46] and shall call his name immanuel which
[49:49] means god is with us
[49:52] brother branham called this an
[49:53] everlasting sign
[49:56] there's a sign god says i'll give you a
[49:58] sign and brother branham says it's an
[50:00] everlasting sign
[50:01] and that sign is a virgin shall conceive
[50:05] and bear a son and call his name
[50:08] god with us
[50:12] brother branham told us he said
[50:17] in this day this bride will fulfill
[50:21] all that was spoken of the virgin
[50:25] this day this bride will fulfill all
[50:28] that was spoken of the virgin
[50:31] what was spoken of the virgin a virgin
[50:33] shall conceive
[50:34] and bear a son and we'll call his name
[50:36] god
[50:37] is present tense with us
[50:40] which god the one that was in that body
[50:43] on the plains of memory
[50:44] the one that was in the body of jesus
[50:46] christ amen through the cycle of
[50:47] redemption amen has completed a
[50:49] redemption cycle so that he can come
[50:51] back
[50:51] into the virgin bride amen who's
[50:54] conceived on the perfect virgin word
[50:56] making her a virgin bride and what has
[50:59] she reconceived on she's conceived on
[51:01] the royal seed and what is she bringing
[51:04] forth she's bringing forth the life of
[51:06] the son
[51:08] what is it what is it what is she
[51:11] bringing forth
[51:13] emmanuel god with us
[51:16] what day are we living in the day that
[51:18] the virgin shall conceive and bring
[51:20] forth the promised sign
[51:22] and his name shall be emmanuel this
[51:24] isn't
[51:25] this is a sign but brother man said this
[51:26] is an everlasting sign
[51:29] what happened then is repeating
[51:31] spiritually now
[51:32] it was natural there it is supernatural
[51:35] now
[51:40] but the man says back in the super sign
[51:41] a virgin shall conceive and from that
[51:43] time
[51:44] god and man will be one united together
[51:46] an
[51:47] everlasting eternal sign a super sign
[51:51] an everlasting eternal sign a super sign
[51:54] is what god and man becoming one how did
[51:57] god a man become one when the virgin
[51:59] conceived
[52:00] and brought forth the son he said but
[52:03] the super sign
[52:04] still god ever remains true to that
[52:07] super sign
[52:08] it's god in man manifesting his written
[52:11] word
[52:12] friends what is the super sign i i i
[52:15] hope
[52:16] i hope that we can all move and
[52:17] transition in our thinking
[52:19] and move away from elohim and mamrie
[52:22] move away
[52:23] amen from from elohim and jesus christ
[52:26] move away from the manifestation in
[52:28] brother branham
[52:30] what is the super sign now the super
[52:33] sign now is god and man becoming one
[52:37] it's the super sign and it's so humble
[52:40] amen the world is
[52:41] missing the super sign it's so humble
[52:44] amen
[52:44] it's in a humble group of people amen
[52:47] brother branham amen when he come and
[52:48] preached the seals
[52:49] he said think something like that when i
[52:51] preached a week ago on sunday i mean god
[52:54] in simplicity how did i know
[52:55] it would be like that what was he
[52:57] preaching he's preaching the seventh
[52:58] seal he's preaching the coming of the
[53:00] lord he's preaching the whole book open
[53:04] so i know it comes in such a simple way
[53:06] amen through a simple preacher in a
[53:08] simple building to simple people
[53:10] and a little brick building on the
[53:12] corner of eighth and penn street
[53:14] in jeffersonville indiana what was
[53:15] happening amen the greatest thing in the
[53:17] scriptures was unfolding
[53:20] and in such a humble way people drove by
[53:22] people walked by
[53:24] people lived nearby amen had no idea
[53:26] what was happening
[53:31] but the mighty god was being unveiled
[53:34] the seals would be taking off and his
[53:37] bride was being called out
[53:40] and put on display
[53:46] but the super sign i'm reading this
[53:48] quote again is still
[53:49] god ever remains true to that super sign
[53:52] it's god and man manifesting his written
[53:55] word his word
[53:56] when he the holy ghost is come upon you
[53:58] he'll reveal these things show them to
[54:00] you
[54:00] and will show you things to come hebrews
[54:02] 13 8 jesus christ is saying yesterday
[54:05] today and forever exactly in christ is
[54:10] the mystery of god revealed he says this
[54:12] is god's great mystery of love expressed
[54:14] that god and man became
[54:18] one what's the love story
[54:21] god and man becoming one
[54:24] it's the love story still today and it's
[54:26] a love story to you and i
[54:29] what does god want to do with us become
[54:31] one with us
[54:34] god what did he call us for what do you
[54:37] want us to do in this
[54:38] life are we here to support a church
[54:41] work are we here to are we here
[54:45] to just listen to tapes you go call us
[54:48] to listen to tapes
[54:50] they're going to call us just to say
[54:52] that brother branham was a prophet
[54:56] he called us for more than that
[55:00] he called he's calling for another super
[55:02] sign
[55:04] and it's going to take a supersede to
[55:06] produce the super sign
[55:09] and that supersede is christ
[55:12] the royal seed of abraham
[55:16] see whatever he is she is he came from
[55:20] her
[55:20] whatever he is she is can't be anything
[55:22] different
[55:23] if he's the word she's the word if he
[55:26] was immanuel
[55:27] she has to be immanuel if he was god
[55:31] with us she has to be god with
[55:33] us
[55:38] god and man became one see the whole
[55:39] thing is god and man one god and man was
[55:42] one there
[55:42] and god and man is one here
[55:46] really god of man was one there
[55:49] back when jesus christ was on the earth
[55:51] and god and man is one here
[55:55] what is it being filled with his spirit
[55:57] him having the preeminence
[55:58] that was god's achievement god's that's
[56:01] god's purpose to do that
[56:03] that he might be in christ in christ in
[56:05] us and all of us together one
[56:07] the holy spirit same thing it revealed
[56:09] it to christ reveals it here
[56:11] and supernatural and the supernatural
[56:13] creative power
[56:14] oh my the same god that could say that
[56:17] to moses let there become frogs the same
[56:19] one could stand up there
[56:21] let this water be turned to wine see
[56:22] amen is that right
[56:24] he's the same god the same one he might
[56:26] even be the same one that says let there
[56:28] be squirrels where there was no
[56:30] squirrels
[56:33] he just don't change it's god and man
[56:35] that's his manifestation
[56:37] that's what he's revealing that's what
[56:38] he's trying to do in god's own word
[56:41] revealing it shows that man cannot
[56:43] create
[56:43] god is the creator it ain't man no more
[56:46] it's god the creator
[56:47] in man which is his church now
[56:52] amen he's not mincing words it's god and
[56:55] man
[56:55] amen which is his church now the
[56:58] dispensation
[56:59] has changed
[57:03] further in christ as the mystery of god
[57:04] revealed you think i'm beside myself i'm
[57:07] not
[57:07] we've got the devil's answer not me that
[57:09] liveth but christ the word living in me
[57:11] it's not my idea it's his power not my
[57:13] idea it's his word
[57:15] he's promised it here it is he said it
[57:17] would be here and here it is
[57:19] we got his answer christ has risen has
[57:22] paid the price for our redemption
[57:24] want god in christ manifested he gave
[57:26] that flesh that in the blood
[57:28] then in the blood might come the life
[57:30] and the flesh be redeemed
[57:32] that god in his redeemed flesh could
[57:35] manifest his word for the day
[57:37] as he did in that day he did it and
[57:40] brother branham brother branham had
[57:41] prophecy that he had to fulfill
[57:43] he had scriptures that he had to fulfill
[57:46] and he fulfilled those scriptures
[57:48] proving amen he was the word on display
[57:52] the word made manifest amen but those
[57:54] scriptures are not our portion of
[57:56] fulfill
[57:57] they've already been fulfilled but
[57:58] there's bride scriptures that have to be
[58:01] fulfilled today
[58:02] and that's our portion of the word to
[58:03] bring forth in this day
[58:05] as a bride amen we don't have to repeat
[58:07] what's been done in another day
[58:09] we don't have to repeat another work in
[58:11] other scriptures
[58:12] amen but the full measure of the words
[58:14] come to be displayed
[58:15] and christ united with his bride the two
[58:18] becoming one and going back to the
[58:20] promise
[58:22] we've got portions of the word to
[58:24] fulfill amen and he's going to fulfill
[58:26] that
[58:26] through us we are the vessels we're not
[58:30] looking for another vessel we are the
[58:31] vessels amen
[58:32] this is the display of god
[58:37] back in christ the mystery of god
[58:38] revealed again he says oh if i could get
[58:40] the world to see that
[58:42] why there you are there is the body of
[58:44] christ living standing redeemed redeemed
[58:46] oh my justified in his sight why
[58:50] why are we justified we are his victory
[58:54] the church is his victory he came forth
[58:58] in his last days with the glorious
[58:59] gospel showing his victory
[59:01] he died for this purpose and we are
[59:03] proof of his victory
[59:05] listen no matter how much you want to
[59:07] display christ
[59:10] he wants it worse see
[59:14] we've got victory when we overcome we
[59:16] have victory when
[59:17] but it's his victory we are his victory
[59:21] i mean we're proof of his victory we're
[59:23] proof of his life amen why
[59:24] why did he come and die he came and died
[59:27] he gave of himself so that he could
[59:29] redeem a bride
[59:31] amen so we are his great achievement we
[59:34] are
[59:35] his great victory that he would have a
[59:36] bride in this day
[59:38] that would stand on his word and display
[59:40] the full word
[59:41] that's his achievement that's his
[59:43] victory that's his goal
[59:45] it's not just something we conjured up
[59:47] it's not just something that that we
[59:49] want to do it's something he wants to do
[59:51] through
[59:51] us we just have to yield him to his hand
[59:55] and believe what he's doing and let him
[59:57] do the
[59:59] the work is his victory he came forth in
[1:00:01] the last days with his glorious gospel
[1:00:03] showing his victory
[1:00:04] he died for this purpose and we are
[1:00:06] proof of his victory
[1:00:07] i mean when we see him coming down and
[1:00:09] living among the church that's his
[1:00:11] victory
[1:00:12] shows that he couldn't keep him in the
[1:00:13] grave neither can they keep us
[1:00:15] that's right and we already potentially
[1:00:18] arise
[1:00:19] because we've raised from the dead
[1:00:20] unbelief in his word
[1:00:22] from denominational creeds to eternal
[1:00:24] word of the eternal god
[1:00:26] which is him himself working through us
[1:00:29] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:00:31] yesterday
[1:00:32] today and forever and then the word
[1:00:35] moves on down into the body from the
[1:00:37] head what is it the same word nothing
[1:00:39] can be added or taken from it
[1:00:41] so that same word moves from the head as
[1:00:43] the day comes close
[1:00:45] down in the body down into the body
[1:00:47] vindicating that they are one
[1:00:48] they are husband and wife their flesh of
[1:00:51] his flesh
[1:00:52] word of his word life of his life spirit
[1:00:55] of a spirit
[1:00:56] so how much different is she than him
[1:01:01] flesh of his flesh this is the day that
[1:01:04] the flesh is becoming word and the word
[1:01:05] is becoming flesh
[1:01:08] where pinch yourself if you're the bride

[1:01:15] word is becoming flesh and the flesh is
[1:01:17] becoming the word

[1:01:22] yours his victory
[1:01:27] flesh of his flesh word of his word life
[1:01:29] of his life spirit of the spirit
[1:01:31] amen how do you know it bears the same
[1:01:33] record
[1:01:34] same fruit same word see manifest christ

[1:01:41] amen same signs the things that i do
[1:01:44] show you also
[1:01:45] oh hallelujah my notice the vindicated
[1:01:48] word in his body
[1:01:49] is his very victory and the reason of
[1:01:52] his death
[1:01:55] the vindicated word in me
[1:02:00] make it personal you the vindicated word
[1:02:02] in you
[1:02:04] the vindicated word in me
[1:02:08] is his victory and the reason
[1:02:11] of his death why did he die
[1:02:14] so that i would be here fully redeemed
[1:02:18] by the purchase of his blood so that he
[1:02:20] could live in me
[1:02:22] and live his life through me not to be a
[1:02:25] church member
[1:02:27] not to be but to be him on display
[1:02:30] in the way that he wants to display
[1:02:32] himself through me
[1:02:34] not the way i want him to display
[1:02:36] himself but the way he wants to display
[1:02:37] himself through me
[1:02:40] through every circumstance through every
[1:02:42] trial
[1:02:43] through every family ordeal through
[1:02:45] every misunderstanding
[1:02:47] through everything that we face he wants
[1:02:49] to express
[1:02:50] his word in every situation in our lives
[1:02:55] no matter how bad we want it he wants it
[1:02:57] worse
[1:02:58] see the death not in the spirit when he
[1:03:00] died he only died
[1:03:02] in the flesh his spirit went to hell and
[1:03:03] preached to the souls in prison that
[1:03:05] right
[1:03:05] his face only died then he raised it up
[1:03:07] again and quickened it quicken means
[1:03:08] made alive
[1:03:09] his flesh which was his body and that's
[1:03:12] the word
[1:03:13] it's been laying dead for years guess
[1:03:16] this brother bam is talking about
[1:03:18] jesus christ the word it's been laying
[1:03:20] dead for years
[1:03:21] but it gradually began to come in the
[1:03:23] reformation and now

[1:03:39] quickens made alive his flesh which was
[1:03:42] his body
[1:03:43] and that's the word it's been laying
[1:03:45] dead for years
[1:03:46] but it gradually began to come in the
[1:03:48] reformation and now she's standing upon
[1:03:50] her feet
[1:03:50] oh how i wish i had time to go back into
[1:03:52] ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and
[1:03:55] show you
[1:03:55] he said can these bones live again he
[1:03:57] said prophesy
[1:03:59] how can prophecy come only through the
[1:04:01] prophet
[1:04:02] it's the word of the lord here you dry
[1:04:04] bones the word of the lord
[1:04:06] and sin you skin came upon them and they
[1:04:08] stood up a mighty army and began to
[1:04:09] march toward zion
[1:04:11] glory to god that's him that's him the
[1:04:14] victory
[1:04:15] let's turn to ezekiel and read this he
[1:04:17] said oh how he wished he had time to go
[1:04:19] into it but praise god we got time
[1:04:23] we got time to go into it ezekiel 37
[1:04:35] i just want to take my time brother
[1:04:38] brennan felt rushed
[1:04:40] i don't want to feel rushed

[1:04:46] oxygen to get the brain cells working
[1:04:49] again just

[1:04:53] trustees could put in
[1:04:54] oxygen little tubes
[1:04:58] so everybody can have oxygen so we don't
[1:05:01] get too sleepy
[1:05:03] you awake praise god let's go to ezekiel
[1:05:06] 37.
[1:05:09] ezekiel 37 verse 1 the hand of the lord
[1:05:12] was upon me
[1:05:13] and carrying me out in the spirit of the
[1:05:14] lord set me down in the midst of the
[1:05:16] valley which was full of bones
[1:05:19] and caused me to pass by them round
[1:05:21] about and behold
[1:05:23] they were very many in the open valley
[1:05:25] and lo they were
[1:05:26] very dry they were they're not dry
[1:05:30] they were very dry they weren't dead
[1:05:33] they were really dead
[1:05:36] they were so dead they were back down
[1:05:38] the bones and them bones were very dry
[1:05:41] and he said unto me son of man can these
[1:05:43] bones live and i answered oh lord god
[1:05:46] thou knowest
[1:05:47] again he said unto me prophesy upon
[1:05:49] these bones and say unto them
[1:05:51] oh you dry bones hear the word of the
[1:05:53] lord thus saith the lord god unto these
[1:05:55] bones behold i will cause breath to
[1:05:57] enter unto you
[1:05:58] and you shall live and i will lay sinews
[1:06:01] upon you and will bring up flesh upon
[1:06:03] you and cover you with skin
[1:06:04] and put breath in you and you shall live
[1:06:07] and you shall know that i am the lord
[1:06:09] so i prophesied as i was commanded and
[1:06:12] as i prophesied
[1:06:13] there was a noise and behold a shaking
[1:06:15] and the bones came together
[1:06:16] bone to his bone and when i beheld lo
[1:06:19] the sinews and the flesh came up upon
[1:06:22] them
[1:06:22] and the skin covered them above but
[1:06:25] there was no breath in them
[1:06:27] then said into me prophesying to the
[1:06:29] wind prophesy son of man
[1:06:30] and say to the wind thus saith the lord
[1:06:33] god come from the four winds o breath
[1:06:35] and breathe upon these slain that they
[1:06:37] may live
[1:06:39] so i prophesied as he commanded me and
[1:06:41] the breath came unto me
[1:06:42] unto them and they lived and stood up
[1:06:44] upon their feet an exceeding
[1:06:46] great army we go back to the quote that
[1:06:50] we're reading from
[1:06:51] brother branham he's talking before this
[1:06:53] he said the vindicated word in his body
[1:06:55] is his victory and the reason of his
[1:06:57] death
[1:06:58] see he says quicken means made alive
[1:07:02] his flesh which was his body that's the
[1:07:05] word it's been laying dead for years
[1:07:07] but it gradually began to come in the
[1:07:09] reformation and now she's standing on
[1:07:11] her feet
[1:07:12] he says oh oh how i wish i had time to
[1:07:15] go back into ezekiel so he's tying this
[1:07:18] with this happening in ezekiel about the
[1:07:19] dry bones because you realize
[1:07:22] before you can have dry bones in a
[1:07:24] valley of dry bones
[1:07:25] you had to have living beings amen the
[1:07:27] church had to be alive at one point
[1:07:30] there had there had to have been a an
[1:07:33] axe church there had to have been a
[1:07:34] church that was alive
[1:07:36] and been filled with the spirit of god
[1:07:37] amen but through four stages amen
[1:07:39] it's come down amen to bones a valley
[1:07:42] full of dry bones in the dark ages
[1:07:47] and it was dead and it was like it was
[1:07:49] dead and brother branham types it with
[1:07:50] christ the word
[1:07:51] amen which is his body and he said it
[1:07:53] laid like it was dead
[1:07:57] but now in the reformation and the
[1:07:59] reformation
[1:08:00] it becomes to come back again
[1:08:03] in in ezekiel when he prophesies after
[1:08:07] he prophesies
[1:08:08] there's three stages that the body goes
[1:08:10] through bones come to bones
[1:08:12] sinew grows on the bones and then
[1:08:15] they're covered in flesh
[1:08:17] justification sanctification baptism in
[1:08:20] the holy ghost
[1:08:23] but yet they're not living yet
[1:08:29] there's got to be a fourth stage
[1:08:32] not the three stages they were standing
[1:08:34] there they were standing on their feet
[1:08:36] again
[1:08:36] they looked like a church
[1:08:39] pentecost looked like a church looked
[1:08:42] like an army standing on their feet
[1:08:43] everything armor body everything but it
[1:08:47] didn't have the life of him yet amen
[1:08:50] had everything but he himself
[1:08:54] and he said now he says prophesy
[1:08:57] again prophesy again and call for the
[1:09:00] winds
[1:09:00] to come and he wrote and they come and
[1:09:02] they were a mighty
[1:09:03] a great army but i want to tell you
[1:09:05] friends that army wasn't a new army
[1:09:08] it was the same army that went down
[1:09:11] it was the body of christ and the body
[1:09:13] of christ is coming back
[1:09:15] and now represented in you and i because
[1:09:17] why
[1:09:18] the word has come back and where is the
[1:09:20] word come back to
[1:09:21] the word has come back to a people amen
[1:09:23] the word has not come back to books the
[1:09:25] word has not come back to tape
[1:09:27] the word has not come back to ink but
[1:09:29] the word has come
[1:09:30] back to flesh to be fleshed
[1:09:34] out in his body which is his church
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] four stages of destruction four stages
[1:09:40] to come back and that last
[1:09:42] that last stage amen through the prophet
[1:09:44] was
[1:09:45] calling the the life to come back
[1:09:48] the wind the spirit amen and he's been
[1:09:50] bound the holy ghost has been bound for
[1:09:52] nearly 2 000 years at the
[1:09:53] at the river denominational rivers
[1:09:57] but is to be loosed in the evening time
[1:10:01] by the evening time message the holy
[1:10:03] ghost the wind
[1:10:05] the breath the life back into the church
[1:10:09] again
[1:10:12] to be what the same
[1:10:15] great army that went down
[1:10:21] the same thing that went down has called
[1:10:24] us back
[1:10:25] when when god came in flesh to show the
[1:10:28] sign of the messiah
[1:10:30] when he came to as elohim in a temporary
[1:10:33] body
[1:10:34] on the plains of memory when he came
[1:10:36] there amen he came and he showed a super
[1:10:38] sign
[1:10:39] of discernment to show him that there's
[1:10:41] a son coming
[1:10:44] but how was that sun going to come that
[1:10:46] sun was going to come
[1:10:47] amen when abraham and sarah were turned
[1:10:50] back to their youthful condition again
[1:10:54] when abraham amen typing the word when
[1:10:57] the word has come back
[1:11:00] but if abraham gets made young again
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:03] there still will do no good because
[1:11:05] abraham needs a wife he needs a bride to
[1:11:08] reproduce himself
[1:11:10] so if you're going to bring the word
[1:11:12] back
[1:11:14] if you're going to bring abraham back to
[1:11:16] a young condition
[1:11:18] amen you have no option but to bring his
[1:11:20] bride back too
[1:11:23] so if the word is going to come back
[1:11:25] amen if abraham's coming back
[1:11:27] sarah has to come back to youthful
[1:11:28] condition too amen said that there can
[1:11:30] be a conception so that she can receive
[1:11:32] the promised son
[1:11:34] and the word is come back in our day
[1:11:37] amen but it doesn't do any good just to
[1:11:39] bring a
[1:11:40] word back in written form amen if you
[1:11:42] don't bring
[1:11:43] amen the bride back to receive that word
[1:11:46] to conceive on the word to bring forth
[1:11:48] the son of man again
[1:11:51] so these dry bones can they live thou
[1:11:54] knowest
[1:11:55] thou knowest prophesy how can they live
[1:11:58] only by prophecy how will they prophesy
[1:12:00] only with the prophet and we've had the
[1:12:02] prophet in this day amen to speak the
[1:12:04] word
[1:12:05] that'll bring life to the dry bones to
[1:12:07] bring it back
[1:12:08] amen to the place that it's fallen from
[1:12:11] to what to be a mighty army the army of
[1:12:14] the lord
[1:12:15] the flesh body of jesus christ on the
[1:12:17] earth that he's working through in this
[1:12:20] day
[1:12:24] it says in the message
[1:12:27] spoken word is the original seed
[1:12:31] now notice now in this god foresaw and
[1:12:33] predestinated a world of sons and
[1:12:36] daughters
[1:12:37] what did god want he wanted a world of
[1:12:40] sons and daughters
[1:12:42] that was his original that's what he saw
[1:12:44] that's what he foresaw
[1:12:46] that's what he wanted that's what adam
[1:12:48] and eve were supposed to produce
[1:12:51] they were supposed to bring forth christ
[1:12:55] now remember christ is that royal seed
[1:12:58] christ is that promised seed amen and if
[1:13:01] things would have been done
[1:13:02] correctly back then the child would have
[1:13:04] come forth would have been christ
[1:13:11] and then they would have had more
[1:13:15] and more and more
[1:13:19] so would the first one have been christ
[1:13:20] what would the rest of them been
[1:13:24] if they brought forth christ the first
[1:13:26] time the next time well that'll be
[1:13:28] christ he's the big brother
[1:13:29] everybody else is just some sub species
[1:13:35] no they would have brought forth christ
[1:13:38] and they could have called his name seth
[1:13:42] could have called his name abel could
[1:13:44] have called his name noah could have
[1:13:45] called him moses
[1:13:49] could have called it chad could have
[1:13:50] called it bob
[1:13:56] do you realize that's how we were
[1:13:57] supposed to come originally
[1:14:01] but the fall disrupted that amen broke
[1:14:03] it down
[1:14:04] but it's still god's desire it's still
[1:14:07] what he wants to have
[1:14:09] amen and all of his children together
[1:14:11] are the royal seed
[1:14:12] are christ we've come
[1:14:16] and fallen flesh we've come through
[1:14:17] hybridization but it doesn't change the
[1:14:20] seed that's on the inside
[1:14:21] amen the seed that's on the inside is
[1:14:23] still what it was originally meant to be
[1:14:25] in the beginning
[1:14:26] but now it has to come through a fallen
[1:14:28] condition and work its way back up that
[1:14:30] way
[1:14:32] it's like the pawn literally brother
[1:14:33] branham talks about born down in the
[1:14:35] mucking mire and pushes its way to the
[1:14:36] light and pushes his way to the light
[1:14:38] and finally breaks forth the light and
[1:14:39] shows what it is on the inside
[1:14:43] but you're not in your ought to be
[1:14:45] conditioned but in your ought to be
[1:14:46] conditioned
[1:14:47] you should have been born perfect amen
[1:14:49] you should have come forth perfect
[1:14:50] all the way back in the garden of eden
[1:14:52] because he wanted a world
[1:14:53] he foresaw a world inhabited with sons
[1:14:56] and daughters
[1:14:57] and he is going to have that world
[1:14:59] friends
[1:15:00] and it's going to be it's going to be
[1:15:02] the father amen and he's going to have
[1:15:04] his family
[1:15:05] which is christ
[1:15:08] male and female
[1:15:14] praise be to god
[1:15:17] notice now in this god foresaw and
[1:15:20] predestinated a world of sons and
[1:15:21] daughters
[1:15:22] he predestinated him to be there and
[1:15:24] because of hybriding disbelieving god's
[1:15:26] word caused the hybriding
[1:15:28] god has put it right back again that you
[1:15:30] don't have to be hybrid
[1:15:32] any more you can come right
[1:15:35] back to the original word and be a son
[1:15:37] of god just like you was supposed to be
[1:15:40] at the beginning oh friends this
[1:15:43] is so absolutely the truth amen i know
[1:15:46] we've got struggles and i know we mess
[1:15:48] up
[1:15:48] and i know we make our mistakes and
[1:15:50] we've got our fusses and we've got all
[1:15:51] these things that go on in us
[1:15:53] amen but we don't have to be hybrid
[1:15:56] anymore
[1:15:58] amen there's been a word that has come
[1:15:59] forth to wash away our hybridization and
[1:16:02] bring us
[1:16:03] back amen to bring that seed to life
[1:16:05] which that seed was to be you in the
[1:16:07] beginning
[1:16:08] that was what was supposed to come forth
[1:16:10] amen but now that seed come forth and
[1:16:12] the wrong kind of flesh amen and receive
[1:16:14] the wrong kind of spirit
[1:16:16] but praise god amen there's a word
[1:16:18] that's come to wake
[1:16:20] up the real you and bring forth that
[1:16:23] real you
[1:16:24] that will begin to take dominion over
[1:16:26] all of this false and we still got the
[1:16:28] troubles we still got all these things
[1:16:30] that that plague us and tempt us and
[1:16:32] trouble our minds and trouble our
[1:16:33] spirits
[1:16:34] it's still there but friends if we can
[1:16:36] keep getting under the washing of water
[1:16:38] of the word
[1:16:38] amen and keep bringing life to the seed
[1:16:41] life to the seed life to deceit
[1:16:43] it'll rise up in greater dominion and
[1:16:45] greater dominion
[1:16:46] until there's such a dominion it will
[1:16:48] change the flesh
[1:16:49] into what god's original idea was
[1:16:53] god made an earth to take you out of
[1:16:56] because his original idea
[1:16:57] was to have a world full of sons and
[1:16:59] daughters he put the elements on the
[1:17:01] earth and
[1:17:02] and on the earth for your body amen not
[1:17:05] to be corrupted and hybrid but to be
[1:17:07] perfect
[1:17:08] and this plan of redemption is taking us
[1:17:11] back to that idea that he had in his
[1:17:13] mind
[1:17:14] sons and daughters and glorified flesh
[1:17:16] upon this earth
[1:17:19] we don't have to be hybrid anymore we
[1:17:22] don't have to be in a hybrid condition
[1:17:23] anymore
[1:17:24] there's a word here to lift us out of
[1:17:25] that and keep lifting and keep lifting
[1:17:27] and keep lifting
[1:17:28] don't get discouraged because your flesh
[1:17:30] hasn't changed yet just let it keep
[1:17:32] lifting and keep lifting and keep
[1:17:34] lifting
[1:17:34] until it all changes
[1:17:38] he's changing us from glory to glory the
[1:17:41] inside has changed
[1:17:44] born again new birth changed
[1:17:48] and now it's working on the outside
[1:17:53] you don't have to be hybrid anymore
[1:17:56] you can come right back to the original
[1:17:59] word
[1:18:00] the original word the idea god had in
[1:18:03] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:18:05] world
[1:18:06] you realize friends we've been taken
[1:18:08] past
[1:18:10] oh i want to say this careful i'm so
[1:18:13] misunderstood sometimes
[1:18:14] we've been taken past the written word
[1:18:19] i don't mean we go beyond the bible we
[1:18:20] believe things not i'm not talking about
[1:18:22] that
[1:18:23] but we've gone past the ability to read
[1:18:28] and brother branham has taken us right
[1:18:29] back to the mind of god
[1:18:32] to know what he meant when he said that
[1:18:33] what was he talking about here
[1:18:35] what does it mean she was beguiled by
[1:18:38] the serpent
[1:18:40] what does that mean he's taken us back
[1:18:42] we've gone back beyond the ability to
[1:18:44] read gone back beyond the ability to
[1:18:46] pray
[1:18:46] and then we've gone back into the mind
[1:18:48] of
[1:18:53] let's god to ephesians chapter five
[1:19:08] ephesians 5.
[1:19:20] ephesians 5 and 25.
[1:19:25] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:19:27] also loved the church
[1:19:29] and gave himself for him that he might
[1:19:31] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:19:33] of water by the word
[1:19:35] that he might present it to himself a
[1:19:36] glorious church not having spot or
[1:19:38] wrinkle
[1:19:39] or any such thing but it should be holy
[1:19:42] and without blemish this is god's great
[1:19:46] achievement
[1:19:49] this is christ's work
[1:19:52] why did he send the word in this day so
[1:19:54] that he could take that word and wash us
[1:19:57] by the water of the word that
[1:20:00] so that we could work really hard
[1:20:04] and get everything right and present
[1:20:06] ourselves no so that
[1:20:07] he that he can come down through a super
[1:20:12] sign
[1:20:12] and say i'm here through a super sign
[1:20:16] amen he can say he can say it is i
[1:20:20] be not afraid there's a man here that
[1:20:22] can turn on the light
[1:20:28] who is brother branham talking about who
[1:20:30] was that man it wasn't brother branham
[1:20:33] it is i be not afraid it wasn't brother
[1:20:35] branham amen who was here
[1:20:36] he himself was here amen and he showed
[1:20:39] in a super sign that he was here
[1:20:41] and he could do like he did on the
[1:20:42] planes of memory and turn his back and
[1:20:43] say you and the balcony there you have
[1:20:45] this and that you're a stranger to me if
[1:20:46] you are raise up your hand
[1:20:49] showing that it wasn't that man amen but
[1:20:52] it was
[1:20:52] it was the son of man it was christ
[1:20:54] himself come down
[1:20:56] so that he could restore back to the
[1:20:58] original word
[1:21:00] because you can't take you can't take a
[1:21:03] contaminated word
[1:21:05] and purify a bride with a contaminated
[1:21:08] word so he's got to come back and show
[1:21:10] that i'm
[1:21:10] here amen this is my word to bring back
[1:21:13] a pure word
[1:21:14] that can purify a bride
[1:21:18] so that he he came
[1:21:21] brother branham didn't have any control
[1:21:23] over what was happening he didn't know
[1:21:25] he didn't understand
[1:21:26] he wasn't controlling anything it was
[1:21:28] controlling him
[1:21:31] what was it he was going to present
[1:21:33] himself
[1:21:35] a bride without sparta wrinkle if he was
[1:21:38] going to present himself as pride was
[1:21:40] he he had to listen friends this is his
[1:21:43] great achievement this is the purpose of
[1:21:44] his death
[1:21:45] this is his victory it's not your
[1:21:47] victory it's his victory
[1:21:50] the fact that he'll have a bride without
[1:21:51] sparta renko is not your victory it's
[1:21:53] his victory
[1:21:57] it's the purpose of his death and so now
[1:22:00] he is going to present himself
[1:22:03] by what by the washing of the water
[1:22:06] by the word that's why the word has come
[1:22:09] back in this day
[1:22:10] so that he can wash us from
[1:22:11] denominations unbelief
[1:22:13] all kinds of wrong ideas and
[1:22:15] misunderstandings and misconceptions
[1:22:17] about god
[1:22:17] and misconceptions about salvation and
[1:22:19] misunderstanding of who we are
[1:22:22] he come to wash us away from spiritual
[1:22:24] amnesia he come to wash away
[1:22:26] all man-made ideas amen so that he could
[1:22:28] present
[1:22:29] us to himself amen a spotless bride
[1:22:33] this is his work and his achievements
[1:22:41] see in the future home brother makes an
[1:22:44] outstanding statement and i got a couple
[1:22:46] quotes that's going to show this here as
[1:22:47] we wind down
[1:22:50] see god in the beginning when he thought
[1:22:53] of you
[1:22:54] he thought of others like that thought
[1:22:56] of himself
[1:22:57] being tangible
[1:23:00] let's read this again in the beginning
[1:23:03] way back when it
[1:23:07] when he thought of you and thought of
[1:23:09] others like that
[1:23:11] he thought of himself being tangible
[1:23:18] i want to read that one more time
[1:23:22] in the beginning when he thought of you
[1:23:24] and he thought of others like that
[1:23:27] thought of himself being tangible
[1:23:32] see god
[1:23:35] created a world
[1:23:38] to take you out of
[1:23:43] and he wanted a world inhabited with
[1:23:46] sons and daughters
[1:23:48] bunny when he looked in his mind when he
[1:23:50] thought with his mind if we could just
[1:23:52] say it like that with
[1:23:53] no understanding you know as a human
[1:23:56] could just use words
[1:23:57] when he thought in his mind he thought
[1:24:00] of a world full of sons and daughters
[1:24:02] and when he was thinking of that world
[1:24:04] full of sons and daughters
[1:24:06] he had to think of me because i'm one of
[1:24:08] them
[1:24:10] did he think of you were you in his mind
[1:24:13] then
[1:24:14] when he was thinking of this world
[1:24:15] inhabited with sons and daughters
[1:24:17] in flesh made out of material the earth
[1:24:19] not hybrid not broken down not found but
[1:24:21] eternal and perfect and beautiful
[1:24:24] with the right spirit that they had
[1:24:26] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:24:28] amen with with the with the c gene of
[1:24:30] god on the inside
[1:24:32] with the theophany spear amen with a
[1:24:34] with a perfect glorified body
[1:24:37] when he looked down at that he thought
[1:24:39] of me
[1:24:41] because i was one of them he thought of
[1:24:43] you you were one of them
[1:24:44] and he was thinking of that world when
[1:24:46] he was looking down at that world and he
[1:24:48] was thinking about sons and daughters
[1:24:50] on the earth he was thinking of himself
[1:24:52] becoming
[1:24:53] tangible what
[1:24:57] was it it was god god moving down
[1:25:00] amen god coming onto the earth to be
[1:25:03] sons and daughters
[1:25:05] god becoming tangible
[1:25:08] god having fellowship with his
[1:25:10] attributes
[1:25:12] god moving among amen why
[1:25:15] why is it that we love each other so
[1:25:17] much
[1:25:19] i mean we frustrate the daylights out of
[1:25:21] each other we still love each other
[1:25:26] what is the bond friends what is it that
[1:25:28] makes you want to come to church and hug
[1:25:29] your brother's neck
[1:25:32] what is it it's god seeking out god
[1:25:38] is god becoming tangible that's why you
[1:25:42] can't break up fellowship amen
[1:25:44] that's why you can't stay off by
[1:25:45] yourself amen because when god thought
[1:25:47] of you and others like you he thought of
[1:25:49] himself becoming tangible
[1:25:51] and he said how can how can you say you
[1:25:53] love god when you don't love your
[1:25:54] brother whom you can't see and you love
[1:25:56] god you can't see
[1:25:58] why did he say that why did he make that
[1:25:59] statement because your brother has
[1:26:01] god inside if he's genuinely your
[1:26:04] brother there's a piece of god inside
[1:26:06] amen and it may not be the outside
[1:26:08] exterior it might be
[1:26:09] you know it might be not the you know
[1:26:11] the man or the woman who sometimes says
[1:26:13] things a little rough or harsh
[1:26:16] that's not what you love it's the life
[1:26:18] on the inside that's trying to express
[1:26:22] through that flesh body that's what you
[1:26:23] love that's why you can't wait to say
[1:26:25] god bless you can't wait to shake their
[1:26:26] hand
[1:26:27] you can't wait to give them a hug you
[1:26:28] can't wait to get back in fellowship
[1:26:30] again you can't wait to sit down at a
[1:26:32] table
[1:26:33] and talk together what is it it's the
[1:26:35] attributes of god
[1:26:36] fellowshipping together again
[1:26:39] they were together in the mind of god
[1:26:41] they've been separated out and portioned
[1:26:43] down
[1:26:43] to come forth in their time in season
[1:26:45] and to be expressed in bodies and we
[1:26:47] know that these bodies are hybrid but
[1:26:49] it's still
[1:26:50] god is still cleansing that so he can
[1:26:52] express himself through it
[1:26:54] it is emmanuel god with us
[1:26:58] that's why we love each other you can't
[1:27:00] love god and not love your brother so
[1:27:04] simple
[1:27:04] the bible's so simple how can you say
[1:27:06] you love god and don't love your brother
[1:27:12] how can there be fightings and
[1:27:15] contentions and strife among us
[1:27:19] shouldn't be we've got to go deeper than
[1:27:21] the flesh
[1:27:22] and look at the attributes
[1:27:25] when god looked down and he saw he saw
[1:27:28] himself
[1:27:29] becoming tangible
[1:27:32] when i see you i see god becoming
[1:27:35] tangible
[1:27:39] oh that flesh it's getting older
[1:27:42] getting weaker at deteriorating but it's
[1:27:43] going to change
[1:27:46] we've got to see something more than
[1:27:47] that
[1:27:49] sometimes you see in your brother or
[1:27:50] sister a little bit of a rough exterior
[1:27:53] because of some complex
[1:27:55] or some childhood damage or something
[1:27:56] going on but somehow
[1:27:58] you love them anyways they're rough as a
[1:28:01] cob and you love them anyways
[1:28:03] and they hurt your feelings all the time
[1:28:05] and you love them anyway guys there's
[1:28:06] something else in there
[1:28:08] there's something behind that veil
[1:28:10] that's expressing something that you
[1:28:12] know
[1:28:12] deeper down that's god that's my brother
[1:28:15] amen and it's one attribute calling out
[1:28:17] to another attribute coming in
[1:28:18] fellowship together
[1:28:20] what is it it's god becoming tangible in
[1:28:23] his bride
[1:28:25] elohim the son of man in his bride
[1:28:30] let's look at romans 8 while we're on
[1:28:31] this subject lay this scripture in
[1:28:43] romans chapter 8 verse 29.
[1:28:56] for whom he did for know he also did
[1:28:59] predestinate
[1:29:00] to be conformed to the image of a son
[1:29:04] did he foreknow you did he predestinate
[1:29:08] you
[1:29:09] what did he predestinate you for to be
[1:29:12] conformed
[1:29:13] to the image of his son and what is his
[1:29:17] son
[1:29:18] the word he predestinated you to be
[1:29:22] conformed into the image
[1:29:24] of the word that he might be the
[1:29:26] firstborn among many brethrens
[1:29:29] this is his victory this is his great
[1:29:32] achievement
[1:29:33] this is the reason of his death
[1:29:36] remember he foreknew you
[1:29:40] you accept that he predestinated you
[1:29:44] he predestinated you to be
[1:29:47] it's not just generic predestination
[1:29:50] sitting over here on shelf sprint no
[1:29:51] predestination
[1:29:52] to something he predestined you to be
[1:29:54] conformed into the image of his son
[1:29:56] till you will be like
[1:30:00] jesus this bride
[1:30:03] is predestinated to be conformed into
[1:30:05] his image
[1:30:07] what is that a super sign
[1:30:11] the supersede christ giving forth the
[1:30:14] super sign
[1:30:16] when god who is his word
[1:30:19] and man become one
[1:30:23] but chad how can i express it
[1:30:26] if you're a woman don't cut your hair
[1:30:29] what's that god the word and man
[1:30:31] becoming one
[1:30:34] you understand because the scripture
[1:30:36] speaks against it
[1:30:38] it's simple friends it goes from the
[1:30:40] simple to the complex it goes from the
[1:30:42] mundane ordinary to the most
[1:30:44] supernatural thing
[1:30:45] all the way through is the word
[1:30:48] and the word god and man is becoming one
[1:30:51] what is it it's emmanuel it's god with
[1:30:53] us where is he he's in his bride
[1:30:55] because the bride has got the full word
[1:30:57] restored she doesn't have the full word
[1:30:59] restore so she can pick and choose she's
[1:31:01] got the full word
[1:31:02] restored so it will conform she'll be
[1:31:04] conformed into that image
[1:31:07] and whatever the word says she'll
[1:31:08] express and whatever the
[1:31:11] attitude the word brings she'll bring
[1:31:12] and whatever whatever the word calls for
[1:31:14] she'll call she'll do it she'll bring
[1:31:16] forth
[1:31:17] whatever the word is calling forth in
[1:31:18] our lives through our individual
[1:31:20] circumstances will be brought forth
[1:31:22] through our lives
[1:31:24] how is the bride and the word the same
[1:31:25] because the bride is expressing
[1:31:28] the full word
[1:31:31] raising children keeping a home
[1:31:34] going to work paying taxes
[1:31:41] the simple the ordinary the routine
[1:31:45] god and man are becoming one
[1:31:49] and if god can be expressed in
[1:31:52] us in the way we pay our taxes
[1:31:57] and the way a man treats his wife in a
[1:31:59] way a wife references her husband
[1:32:04] in a way we dress and the way we speak
[1:32:06] about one another
[1:32:09] the reverence and respect we have for
[1:32:11] god's word the residence reverence and
[1:32:13] respect we have for one another
[1:32:15] if god amen if god can become one with
[1:32:17] us
[1:32:18] and we can become one with the word and
[1:32:20] display the word in all those little
[1:32:22] things
[1:32:24] then he can speak squirrels into
[1:32:25] existence too
[1:32:27] then he can say unto this mountain be
[1:32:29] plucked out and cast and see but don't
[1:32:31] try to talk to the mountain if you can't
[1:32:33] talk right to your wife
[1:32:37] see what i'm saying if we can't keep
[1:32:40] from fussing and fighting amidst
[1:32:41] ourselves
[1:32:42] quit trying to call for the tree to quit
[1:32:43] bringing fig trees amen
[1:32:45] if we can't even do we got to keep the
[1:32:48] word we got to keep
[1:32:48] all the word and man we want to see such
[1:32:52] dynamic supernatural things but i'm
[1:32:55] telling you friends the dynamic
[1:32:56] supernatural things are built on the
[1:32:58] back of
[1:32:59] every day calm and living the word
[1:33:02] day after day amen decision after
[1:33:05] decision
[1:33:05] conversation after conversation it's got
[1:33:08] to be the word the word the word the
[1:33:10] word in our home the word in my mind the
[1:33:12] word in my heart
[1:33:12] amen the word when nobody's looking
[1:33:17] the word in our conversation with one
[1:33:18] another amen the word would not
[1:33:20] work the word when i'm at church it's
[1:33:22] got to be the same word at church it's
[1:33:23] the same word at work
[1:33:26] not one life here and another life there
[1:33:31] not one testimony here it's got to be
[1:33:33] the word the word the word the word the
[1:33:35] word
[1:33:39] and word on top of word on top of word
[1:33:41] on top of word
[1:33:44] i'll tell you what's more supernatural
[1:33:48] be careful i say this i feel like i got
[1:33:50] to be careful all the time
[1:33:52] but i love you guys you love me so i'm
[1:33:53] not going to be careful
[1:33:56] what's more supernatural than seeing
[1:33:59] blind eyes open

[1:36:41] it's not your victory it's his victory
[1:36:45] it's his achievement it's been his goal
[1:36:48] so what do i have to do brother chad
[1:36:50] stay
[1:36:52] under the washing of the water
[1:36:55] by the word this word came
[1:37:00] to identify a bride this word came to
[1:37:02] wash a bride
[1:37:04] so that he could present to himself he
[1:37:07] could present to himself a bride
[1:37:10] without spot or wrinkle why
[1:37:14] because god wants to be tangible
[1:37:19] in you and i his desire
[1:37:24] brother says in the message god is his
[1:37:26] own interpreter
[1:37:29] he said i mean attributes was his
[1:37:31] thoughts and a word is a thought
[1:37:32] expressed
[1:37:33] and then that was in his thinking and
[1:37:36] when he said let there be
[1:37:37] and there was let there be and there was
[1:37:40] and now remember you christians were his
[1:37:42] thoughts before there was a world
[1:37:44] and you are the manifestation of his
[1:37:46] thinking
[1:37:51] his thinking his victory his goal
[1:37:55] his purpose you see the pattern
[1:37:59] he saw us because he wants to be
[1:38:01] tangible
[1:38:04] amen before there even was a world you
[1:38:08] were in christ
[1:38:09] amen i'm the royal seed i had to be in
[1:38:12] christ
[1:38:13] before there was even a world you were
[1:38:15] in christ in god in the beginning
[1:38:17] that makes you then you see his subjects
[1:38:19] and the whole thing is god himself
[1:38:22] materializing himself
[1:38:23] tangible so he could be handled seen and
[1:38:26] so forth
[1:38:27] and that's what god is the whole thing
[1:38:32] what
[1:38:38] god wants to be tangible held
[1:38:43] touched that was his goal
[1:38:47] he's going to have it in a perfect way
[1:38:50] in the new heavens and the new earth
[1:38:53] but he's going to have it also in his
[1:38:56] bride
[1:38:59] he's going to have it in his brothers
[1:39:00] and sisters
[1:39:03] not a second person not a third person
[1:39:06] not a fourth person sometimes we think
[1:39:09] we must be the millionth person
[1:39:13] but it's god god
[1:39:16] what's what's the attribute of god god
[1:39:18] what's the word of god god
[1:39:21] god wants to be tangible in your flesh
[1:39:25] in my flesh
[1:39:26] he wants to be seen he wants to be heard
[1:39:29] through our lips
[1:39:30] seen through our actions demonstrating
[1:39:33] his word
[1:39:35] the message identification he says then
[1:39:37] see god come down
[1:39:38] and the character of god was christ he
[1:39:41] was the reflection he was god made
[1:39:43] visible
[1:39:43] god made visible what was christ god
[1:39:46] made visible
[1:39:47] in the beginning was god he wasn't even
[1:39:49] god then no god is an object of worship
[1:39:51] only thing he was was the eternal and in
[1:39:54] him was attributes and those attributes
[1:39:55] were thoughts
[1:39:56] and those thoughts was expressed to
[1:39:58] words and the word was made manifest
[1:40:01] what is it it's all god becoming
[1:40:04] tangible
[1:40:05] and you are part of god
[1:40:08] and jesus come to redeem those that was
[1:40:10] put on the lamb's book of life
[1:40:12] before the foundation of the world it
[1:40:13] was in god's thoughts and that's what he
[1:40:15] came to redeem and them as soon as it
[1:40:18] strikes them they see it
[1:40:19] because the life is in there
[1:40:23] he said in the restoration of the bride
[1:40:24] tree he said otherwise you're going to
[1:40:27] form what's known to me
[1:40:29] as a bride see it's i'll go with you
[1:40:34] you will be part of me you will be my
[1:40:35] bride my life will be in your body just
[1:40:37] like husband and wife as one person
[1:40:40] you and i are going to be one at that
[1:40:42] day you'll know that i am in the father
[1:40:43] the father and me i in you and you and
[1:40:45] me
[1:40:46] oh i just love that satan just gets so
[1:40:48] angry at that see
[1:40:50] the oneness of god
[1:40:55] the oneness of god this is why brother
[1:40:58] branham couldn't preach
[1:40:59] pentecostal oneness
[1:41:02] couldn't preach trinitarianism because
[1:41:05] neither one is adequate to express
[1:41:07] god the oneness of god is all of his
[1:41:10] attributes
[1:41:12] is the oneness of god god is his
[1:41:14] attributes god is his word his word is
[1:41:16] his attributes
[1:41:17] his attributes are his thoughts his
[1:41:18] thoughts expressed through his words
[1:41:21] what is the believer the words in the
[1:41:22] book what book the lamb's book of life
[1:41:26] you see no matter which way which angle
[1:41:28] we take and try to describe it it all
[1:41:30] comes back to the same thing
[1:41:32] our origin was in god we come from god
[1:41:35] we go to god it is a part of god
[1:41:44] god satan just gets so angry at that see
[1:41:46] the oneness of god
[1:41:47] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:41:49] and all that christ was he poured into
[1:41:51] the church
[1:41:51] there you are makes them all
[1:41:54] one let's read one more scripture as we
[1:41:59] close first john
[1:42:00] chapter 4. musicians if you want to make
[1:42:04] your way up
[1:42:05] and brother ben first john 4.
[1:42:16] first john 4 and 17.
[1:42:22] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[1:42:24] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:42:27] because as he is so are we
[1:42:31] in this world
[1:42:34] as he is it didn't say
[1:42:38] we will one day be
[1:42:41] as he is so are we in this world
[1:42:46] what is he the word what are you
[1:42:50] the word what is a word
[1:42:53] a thought expressed what was that see
[1:42:56] gene of god inside of you an attribute
[1:42:58] of god was an attribute a thought
[1:43:00] what is a word a thought expressed when
[1:43:02] that attribute comes to life by the
[1:43:04] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:05] and starts to live out that's the word
[1:43:09] that's the anointed word which is
[1:43:12] christ the bride of christ
[1:43:16] is the body of christ
[1:43:19] it is god desiring to be tangible
[1:43:25] love one another that's why john he got
[1:43:28] so revelated he went to heaven brother
[1:43:30] baby says he's
[1:43:30] so revelated he went to heaven he's seen
[1:43:32] all that was there he's seen all the way
[1:43:34] over into the millennium the new heavens
[1:43:36] and the new earth and he comes back and
[1:43:38] he says
[1:43:39] little children love one another
[1:43:43] let's make it simple little children
[1:43:46] love one another
[1:43:48] i've been to heaven i've been back i've
[1:43:50] seen all through the church ages
[1:43:52] and i've seen the tribulation period
[1:43:53] i've seen the calling on the jews
[1:43:55] i've seen the new heavens and the earth
[1:43:56] come up after the millennial ring i've
[1:43:58] seen it all
[1:44:00] and the best thing that i can give you
[1:44:03] after seeing it all is this
[1:44:05] little children love one another
[1:44:09] because when you love one another you
[1:44:10] love god
[1:44:13] super simple we were together before
[1:44:17] we'll be together again i'm attracted to
[1:44:21] you and you're attracted to me
[1:44:23] you're not attracted to me from my good
[1:44:24] looks that's a guarantee
[1:44:28] and that's probably the reason i'm not
[1:44:29] attracted to you either
[1:44:35] but there's something else there that's
[1:44:37] irresistible
[1:44:39] there's a magnetism in the children of
[1:44:41] god
[1:44:42] you know brother bram said you know how
[1:44:44] you get around some people and they just
[1:44:45] create an
[1:44:46] atmosphere around them you just want to
[1:44:47] be near them
[1:44:49] other people they seem okay they're all
[1:44:51] right but you just can't wait to get
[1:44:52] away
[1:44:55] they look good on the outside they seem
[1:44:57] all right but
[1:44:59] there's something you can't connect with
[1:45:02] something not there there's people you
[1:45:05] get around and you just love to be
[1:45:06] around them you just want to talk to
[1:45:08] them you just want to spend time
[1:45:09] you just want to be in their atmosphere
[1:45:12] i tell you what friends it's not the
[1:45:14] good genetics
[1:45:17] it's not the way they comb their hair
[1:45:21] their nice teeth if you as a
[1:45:24] redeemed child of god come in contact
[1:45:26] with that there's something else there
[1:45:29] brother branham would call him on the
[1:45:31] pulpit and said i see you have a
[1:45:32] welcoming spirit
[1:45:37] i just want to say this little children
[1:45:39] love one another
[1:45:43] because if you love one another you love
[1:45:45] god and if you can't love your brother
[1:45:47] you see
[1:45:47] you know you can't tell me you love god
[1:45:49] who you haven't seen
[1:45:51] because his brother is his
[1:45:53] representation on the earth
[1:45:55] this brother by the washing of the water
[1:45:58] of the word and uniting with christ has
[1:45:59] become
[1:46:00] elohim god with us
[1:46:03] the supersede displaying the super sign
[1:46:07] and it's a everlasting sign this virgin
[1:46:11] bride is conceived on the word
[1:46:13] and what is she bringing forth the word
[1:46:17] in simple humble everyday life the word
[1:46:20] is on display
[1:46:22] and it's attractive to the attributes of
[1:46:24] god
[1:46:26] we're polarized to one another
[1:46:31] love one another love god
[1:46:34] will we always get it right probably not
[1:46:38] does that matter so much not really
[1:46:43] but when we love one another we better
[1:46:46] let's all stand
[1:46:51] when you've climbed to the peak of the
[1:46:53] stature of a perfect man
[1:46:55] you've got all your ducks in a row and
[1:46:58] you've lined up temperance
[1:47:00] virtue godliness
[1:47:03] you've got buttons on your merit badge
[1:47:06] seth
[1:47:08] when you've got all the great
[1:47:09] achievement you've gone all the way to
[1:47:11] the top
[1:47:12] the last great achievement of them all
[1:47:15] is love divine
[1:47:20] godly agapo love
[1:47:24] if we don't have love we don't have
[1:47:26] nothing
[1:47:30] and what is the bride she is the
[1:47:32] supersede
[1:47:33] christ on earth and what is she to
[1:47:35] portray
[1:47:36] the super sign and what is the super
[1:47:39] sign
[1:47:40] god and man become one
[1:47:45] that's the bride's ministry on this
[1:47:47] earth
[1:47:48] don't overlook it friends don't look for
[1:47:52] fireworks don't look for
[1:47:54] pyrotechnics on the stage don't look
[1:47:56] look for that
[1:47:57] humble life that humble loving life
[1:48:01] that's reverent to god and obedient to
[1:48:03] god's word
[1:48:04] watch for that you're going to see
[1:48:05] elohim
[1:48:08] watch for remember jesus had three and a
[1:48:10] half years
[1:48:12] of light's camera action but he had 30
[1:48:14] years
[1:48:15] of molding his character and learning
[1:48:17] obedience by the things he suffered and
[1:48:19] growing and increasing
[1:48:22] right what was he in those 30 years
[1:48:25] the word made flesh
[1:48:30] every day living a life i bet the ones
[1:48:33] around him noticed it was different
[1:48:37] don't overlook the life
[1:48:40] don't overlook the everyday your brother
[1:48:43] living a godly life
[1:48:44] every day your sister living a godly
[1:48:46] life every day don't overlook that
[1:48:47] that's elohim that's god becoming
[1:48:49] tangible
[1:48:51] learn to respect it learn to cherish it
[1:48:53] learn to honor it
[1:48:55] there's a lot of people in the world
[1:48:56] that can do mighty wonderful signs
[1:48:59] open blinded eyes he opened the hearing
[1:49:02] of the
[1:49:02] deaf they can do wonderful things they
[1:49:04] can preach like it's nobody's business
[1:49:06] they can put on a show for the masses
[1:49:08] amen but they cannot live the life
[1:49:10] simple and humble every day don't
[1:49:14] overlook the sign of him
[1:49:16] what's he here to do what did that union
[1:49:19] do
[1:49:19] he came the son of man to reveal himself
[1:49:21] the son of man to unite the head and the
[1:49:23] body together to do what
[1:49:25] to show the son of man again in humility
[1:49:29] and reverence and obedience and empower
[1:49:33] the power to live the word
