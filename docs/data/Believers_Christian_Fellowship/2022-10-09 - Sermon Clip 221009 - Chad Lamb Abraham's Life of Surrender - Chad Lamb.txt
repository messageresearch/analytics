========================================

nobody wants difficult situations nobody wants fusses and fights nobody wants a hard situations the Apostle Paul did not want a thorn in his flesh that was not his choice that was the choice of God who knew what Paul needed so that he wouldn't become puffed up so they can in humility and Minister the word and God Did It for Paul and God Did It for the people that would hear Paul Paul didn't want it amen but once he realized it was the will of God he surrendered himself to it it was not angry about it was not bitter over it did not get hurt till God tow towards God Amen all of a sudden he began to glory in his he said now therefore glory in my infirmities for when I am weak then am I made strong ball began to learn to to yield and even brother Branham he had a problem with tension all of his life amen and there towards the latter part of his ministry he said you know this tension's bothered me all my life I get the blues I get the feeling like nobody loves me and I know that's not the truth that's just me doing that and he starts to describe the tension that he gets under and the anxiety and and the depression that he goes through and he starts to explain this amen and then he says but I got to thinking about this tension it's this tension that drove me to Christ he said what would I be without tension he said it's good for me instead of cursing the thing and getting upset about it and getting angry amen he began to realize that God was using this for me this is a blessing of God it drove me to Christ it keeps me dependent on Christ amen it keeps it keeps us in the right State of Mind many times and and I've seen so many times where people go through very difficult situations very difficult family situations difficult marriage situations a difficult work situation whatever kind of situation Church situations and you realize after talking to them for a little while they're hurt but they're hurt towards God because they said God could have prevented it God could have stopped it why could God allow it to happen why why am I going through this and why is this happening in my life and they're hurt over the situation but the more you talk to them to realize they're actually hurt at God Amen and there's a little bit of hurt they're harboring towards the almighty God because they know God could have stopped it God could prevent it and I don't understand why God allowed it and I just want to I want to live the life of Abraham and say God allowed it for my purpose there's some benefit in it somewhere I'm not going to be hurt at God I'm not going to be offended at God I won't be a hurt or offended towards my brother I'll just recognize that God is working something in my life and I needed another layer of separation
