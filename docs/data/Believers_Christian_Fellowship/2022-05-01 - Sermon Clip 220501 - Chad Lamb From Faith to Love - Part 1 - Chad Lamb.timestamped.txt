[0:00] so many people think they can say
[0:01] anything they want if it's true
[0:04] you'll see people sometimes say
[0:05] something to somebody it's so rude so
[0:07] cutting so sharp and you say something
[0:09] to them say but it was the truth
[0:12] jesus could have said a lot of things
[0:14] that was the truth but he didn't say a
[0:15] word
[0:16] when he stood before pilate he could
[0:18] have said a lot of things but he didn't
[0:20] speak when he was on the cross he could
[0:21] have said a lot of things that would
[0:23] have been every bit the truth but he
[0:25] kept his peace
[0:26] all he said is father forgive them
[0:29] we think sometimes we have a right to
[0:31] cut people down or set the record
[0:33] straight or expose somebody's sin or
[0:35] something like that and then we feel
[0:37] justified because it's the truth
[0:40] i think what we need is some holy ghost
[0:41] temperance
[0:44] to say what good would it do anyways it
[0:46] won't change them
[0:48] if you speak the truth you have to speak
[0:49] the truth in love
[0:52] so don't be angry at a brother and want
[0:54] to stick it to him and say i'm just
[0:55] saying this because i love you
[0:58] that doesn't justify what you're getting
[1:00] ready to do amen you have to really love
[1:03] them to say the truth not say you love
[1:05] them just to clear up you know i've
[1:08] already okay i love you okay now i'm
[1:10] going to cut you to the heart
[1:12] in front of your wife and your children
[1:14] but i already said i love you and i said
[1:16] it in love so it's the truth and i'm
[1:17] okay no we need some temperance
[1:20] to control ourselves no retaliation
[1:24] there's no there doesn't need to be any
[1:25] retaliation
[1:27] you know jesus didn't even set the
[1:29] record straight
[1:32] so many false accusations so many things
[1:35] were said against him so many lies
[1:37] defaming his character calling them
[1:39] bails above doubting his birth all these
[1:42] things
[1:43] they were coming against him amen
[1:45] denying his place in scripture denying
[1:46] his sonship all of these things and he
[1:49] never set the record straight
[1:52] he let them believe whatever they wanted
[1:54] to believe he had absolute temperance he
[1:56] was just going to do what god told him
[1:57] to do
[1:59] i mean so many times we're so tempted
[2:01] when somebody spoke evil about us or
[2:03] said something or a rumor comes full
[2:05] circle and comes around and you know
[2:07] that's not true hey you know what
[2:10] sometimes it doesn't do any good to set
[2:11] the record straight and most of the time
[2:13] when you try to set the record straight
[2:14] you look guiltier
[2:19] sometimes that's just a trap of the
[2:20] devil to get you in a little deeper
[2:24] jesus didn't pay the time of day to it
[2:26] he kept doing what the father called him
[2:27] to do and i think it's a good habit for
[2:29] us to not pay any attention to the
[2:31] rhetoric not pay any attention to the
[2:33] accusation of somebody at work he's
[2:36] trying to defame your character trying
[2:38] to take credit for your work just let it
[2:40] go let god expose it when god does it's
[2:43] way better anyways
[2:46] you're not here for a promotion and
[2:48] you're not here for a good name at work
[2:50] you're here to serve god's purpose
[2:52] and if it god's purpose he has you in
[2:54] that job and you need a good standing in
[2:56] that job god will right the wrong and
[2:58] when god writes the wrong i mean nobody
[3:01] can work like god can work and nobody
[3:03] can fix a situation like god can fix the
[3:05] situation in fact if you keep quiet and
[3:08] have temperance in hand and you just
[3:10] wait on the lord and have patience you
[3:12] watch god work by the time god's done
[3:14] you'll feel sorry for that man or woman
[3:18] that's what will happen you'll have
[3:19] sympathy for them
[3:20] and because i mean you could have been
[3:22] so upset so hurt and have such a
[3:25] temptation to go set the record straight
[3:27] because you know that they would be in
[3:28] big trouble you didn't do anything wrong
[3:30] they did it wrong they're lying blah
[3:32] blah blah whatever but you just hush up
[3:34] and have temperance control yourself and
[3:36] stay in the line god puts you in and
[3:38] when god solves that problem you end up
[3:40] saying oh god help them i'm sorry i
[3:42] didn't want that to happen to them
[3:44] you'll feel so sorry for them
[3:48] amen what is it going to take holy ghost
[3:50] temperance
