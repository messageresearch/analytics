for somebody must declare your glory in this world and in this earth Lord You' revealed yourself to us what can we do but declare your glory magnify your name and it's our privilege Lord and now we

might be yielded to you and that you might have control and speak your word and your word only and may Lord we Feast on that and grow Stronger by that portion we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you all while we're standing this evening let's take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Revelation and uh just want to say I heard from Brother Emanuel that he got back from Pittsburgh for ministering for Brother John last Sunday and the services went well he was on his way here this evening but he got caught in a hailstorm and had to turn back so I we just trust that all is well with him and we can see him on Sunday also uh Brother Kyle wer he'll be traveling this Sunday to uh go Minister for brother Jean as well so we want to pray for he and his family and then I want to remind you that this Sunday brother Burley Williams will be preaching for us so we want to keep all of these things in prayer for Brother Kyle and his family for traveling Mercies in Ministry there and brother Burley for the same coming here we're very much looking forward to having him with us again as we're standing with our Bibles let's look at Revelation 19 verse 7 Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife ha made herself ready now let's turn to chapter 21 chapter 21:9 let's read there next and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last place plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife man God bless you as you have your seats may the Lord bless us as we look into his word this evening amen amen without his Blessing it would be impossible without him giving us eyes to see and ears to hear we would be just as lost but I thank God he's promised amen that he would help us in this hour amen we look at these two scriptures and I I grabbed these just to show that without question the lamb has a wife amen the lamb has a wife there's no question about it we read in in chapter 19 that she's made herself ready and in chapter 21 the seventh angel was going to show us the Lamb's wife the bride the Lamb's wife so the lamb has a wife amen I think that's really important so that's what we want to talk about this evening is the Lamb's wife amen how many wants to be that amen that's our desire to be the Lamb's wife We Believe by revelation we are but it it means a lot to say something like that and I wanted to read a quote from proving his word just to show where we are in time we know it really well but I'm going to lay it down uh once again he said Jesus says As it was in the days of Sodom and Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more is a church SE not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride so the re the revealing of the son of man is the coming of the son of man to do what to unite The Head and the body to unite the bride and with the head for the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman oh I don't know do you see what I mean brother R says it's not a clergyman so you don't look at him it's not a preacher he said it's more than the preacher it's more than the clergy man it's more than the man it's the son of man coming down he's working through that flesh of course but it's the son of man he says not a clergyman oh I don't know do you see what I mean it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage now this is the purpose for me reading this so we can get this point here amen he so he goes to quote of scripture fill yourself of the Flesh of Mighty Men cuz the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they two become one then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing amen this quote is so Monumental because it tells us where we are in time amen and we are now in the marriage of the Lamb the marriage of the Lamb has come the marriage is taking place right now so the son of man has come down into flesh not a clergymen but he's he's using that flesh to manifest himself it's the revealing of the son of man to make his word so real that it'll unite The Head and the body it'll bring the marriage of the bride and the bridegroom call will come through this and he said the marriage is taking place now the invisible Union is taking place now the Rapture will be going to the marriage supper amen so that's why when we talk about the Lamb's wife amen it's important to know that the marriage is taking place now amen amen we're not talking about something future we talk about the Lamb's wife amen but he's taking his bride to himself now this is the dispensation we live in where he's uniting with her and he's uniting one by one as as as the members of his body gathered together they're uniting with the headship of Christ and the marriage of the Lamb is taking place amen so that means that means the lamb has a wife but wife brings with it a the term wife brings with it a whole set of responsibilities that are different than just bride and that's what we want to talk about for a little while and we might continue on I don't know how much we'll get done but but it just keeps unfolding as we go so the term wife when we come to the term wife amen we have you have bride and you can be talking about a a an engagement phase and and a phase leading up to marriage amen but but when you talk about wife it brings a whole new set of responsibilities and a whole new Set uh of of of of of responsibilities and issues amen that we must administer and so uh my my wife was my bride before she was my wife but now that she's my wife she's still my bride I'm still a bride but I believe by the union of Christ I've become the Lamb's wife part of that wife I'm not it in a whole but we are many member many member body and so because I believe that to be true amen the then the question is am I willing to take the responsibility of wife that's different than just bride not girlfriend phase not engagement phase amen but now the wife what responsibility is that let's go back to Genesis chapter 2 and keep laying a few scriptures in here Genesis chapter 2 in verse 23 and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh and my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 all the way to the New Testament to the Apostle Paul writing to the Ephesian Church Ephesians chapter 5 and I'm going to read verse 29 to 32 Ephesians 5 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones now he goes right back to what what Adam just said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church so he says in verse 30 we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones I don't know how more specific he can be that we are part of his body amen and so this is what Adam said would take place in a marriage and this is what uh the Apostle Paul is saying is taking place in the marriage that we become part of his flesh of of his flesh of his see here I want to get it right members of his body of his flesh and of his bones amen we are united with him now we've come to the to the marriage of the lamb praise God and he speaks a great mystery it looks like marriage uh Earthly marriage but it's only typing the union between Christ and the bride and they are to be one flesh brother brandham says not I'm sorry not brother brandham but the angel of the Lord told him to pick up his pen and write and I'm going to read this from the church age book and just read just a small segment said notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes the full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time I find this quote fascinating amen because it wasn't brother brandham just receiving a revelation or even seeing a vision it was actually the angel of the Lord told him to pick up his pen and write and he was writing and not even knowing what he was writing till he stopped and and and and he took it out and he had to read what he just wrote showing that this is a message from the angel of the Lord to us declaring to us that there was something that Christ did not finish in his Earthly Journey he left he left what did he leave it for for the other part of himself for the other part of his body those who are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones he left that part of the work for them to do amen and now in order to do that work she must come under the headship of Christ which is the fullness of this word that's been restored and she must have thus sayeth the Lord amen which is the word and she must have that or she keeps still what's it showing she must come to the place of of a submissive wife of a perfectly submissive wife in order to fulfill this commission she can't fulfill it on her own she can't fulfill it without his headship she can't fulfill it without being submissive to her headship amen but yet it must be fulfilled cuz it was left for this specific time it's not going to be left undone he's not going to not finish any of his work but he's going to finish it but he must have a a bride he must have a wife who comes under the submission of headship in order to finish this work that's why it's different to be a a wife than just a bride amen because the wife now comes under the headship of her of her husband and she must come under complete authority of her husband amen sometimes we wonder why we preach headship and why we preach submission and the roles of and the roles of a woman and the roles of a husband and the roles of a wife amen because our Earthly marriages must be a reflection of this image of Christ in his bride amen and it's not just preaching it to so so we can have men who are egotistical and and they get to dominate over the women it has nothing to do with any of that it has everything to do with keeping the picture of the Bible pure and straight and that's why brother B said one of the most horrible things on earth is a dominating woman why because it's the spirit that's in the Catholic church it's the spirit of denominationalism a dominating woman amen it it ruins the entire picture because the only way that God can finish his work amen through Christ is for her to take on the headship of Christ and come into submission to that word regardless of her thoughts or feelings or ideas why because her husband Christ Jesus Christ when he was here he had to come under complete submission to the headship of the father father and only then could he finish his commission his part of the commission now the further part of the commission the work that he left for this specific time can only be done if we come under perfect headship Amen to our bridegroom amen so it's different than girlfriend boyfriend it's different than the the the stage of the butterflies and the excitement and enthusiasm amen now it comes to the place where where we get down to the reality of Life yes amen I I as I told you I said I believe it was when I was in Australia I said it like this uh everybody wants to be a bride but nobody wants to be the wife because when the honeymoon's over after the after the big day and the pageantry and the flowers and the decorations and the Beautiful music and the and the and the woman being the center of attention the beautiful dress and all of that amen after the honeymoon's over you come back and and somebody's got to do the dishes somebody's got to pack the lunch somebody's got to wash the clothes amen it's not all fuzzy feelings all the time it's not all glory and it's not all pageantry all the time sometimes you get down to the work of being a wife amen and it's about service submission it's about sacrifice brother BR said in the token he says Jesus was baptized by John and the Bible said and they saw the spirit of God like a dove coming down upon him therefore if it would have been a wolf or if it had been any other animal the nature of the dove could not have blended with the nature of the wolf neither could the nature of the dove blend with any other animal but the lamb and those two Natures come together then they could agree with each other what if the dove had come down and instead of it being a lamb there would have been some other animal it would quickly have taken its flight and went back but when he found that nature that he could blend into he just became one and then the dove led the lamb and notice it led the lamb to slaughter now the lamb was obedient to the dove no matter where it led it was willing to go and so now brother bram's showing a picture of that day on the on the banks of Jordan when Jesus was baptized and the spirit of God descended like a dove and it rested upon the lamb and he mentions a several different places he said that Dove could not rest on anything with a nature an aggressive nature or the wrong nature a wolf or anything else it could only rest on a lamb because they had the same nature and when it rested on the lamb then the dove became the leader of the lamb and the lamb followed the leadership of the dove amen because because the lamb is a follower a lamb is submissive amen so now the dove couldn't descend anywhere else but it said notice and the and and it led the lamb to slaughter but the lamb followed along another question is if the lamb has a wife what kind of wife will the lamb have if the lamb has a wife then his wife will be a lamb because there's no h breeding there couldn't be anything else there couldn't be any other nature there couldn't be any other kind of animal if the lamb has a wife then his wife must be a lamb oh praise God and we know that the that the dove the Holy Ghost could not descend on any other nature only on the nature of the lamb but we live in the day amen when when when the Holy Ghost has descended in full measure at the opening of the word to rest where on Lambs amen coming back on the lamb to do what to lead the lamb in Matthew 4:1 it says then was Jesus led up of the spirit unto the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil when Jesus received this Holy Ghost when the Dove came and began to lead him where is the first place the dove leads him the dove leads him into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil what a leading place to lead the lamb but the lamb is a sacrificial animal and he's a submissive animal so if we want to be the bride what kind of nature should we exhibit as the bride the same that Christ had amen so where can the spirit lead us to where the question is where will we where will we be willing to follow the dove to We Will Follow the dove to Blessings we may follow the dove to church we may follow the dove to special meetings we may follow the dove in blessing and reward are we willing to follow the dove into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil what if that's where that's what if that's where the dove wants to lead are we going to change nature and stop being a lamb if the dove wants to lead us into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil are we going to be the Lamb's wife and have the same nature of the Lamb because there's no high breeding so if he's a lamb we have to be a lamb and if the and the dove leads the lamb then can the Holy Ghost lead us today into places we don't even in our flesh want to go amen Jesus in his flesh I'm sure he didn't want to go fasting 40 days and afterwards being aung and when he was Hunger now being tempted of the devil with all of these Temptations but he had to pass the test amen so now are we willing to be a wife to go to go anywhere our bridegroom goes are we willing to be a wife I mean before before we're a wife before we say yes we can we can weigh things out you know I'm talking in the natural we can look at it we can look at a young man if there's a young man interested in a young woman she can sit back and she can say I mean what what kind of nature is he does he have a good job what kind of home will he provide amen where does he live and what's he doing and and all of those things she can consider but the day she says yes and she takes those vows amen she is now under the headship of the man amen and her days of choosing are now over because she's accepted the headship of this man if he moves she moves amen if he loses all her his wealth with a poor decision she's lost all her wealth she must stick with him amen is that true or not true then if that's true in the natural what's true in the spiritual amen if the if this is the way the Lamb's going to walk which way is the Lamb's wife going to walk if he passes through Troubled Water what is she going to do say I'm not going there I'm going back to Mom and Dad she's not going back to Mom and Dad she's married to the lamb amen amen why sometimes we want the benefits amen but we don't want the sacrifice we want the we want the label and we want the day of Glory but we don't want the day of sacrifice and surrender and submission but if he was a lamb she'll be a lamb amen it'll be the nature and our nature is being changed to the nature of the Lamb amen let's go to Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 I'm going look at verse 29 Romans 8 verse 29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren I thank God that he predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son it's our only hope but yet we know what the destination is to be conformed into the image of the sun to be like the lamb amen we know that we've been reading in second Peter 1 we've read it several times now the last several times we ministered how that he's given us precious promises that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature amen adding to our faith virtue and all of these things all the way up to the Capstone which is love so what are the Divine Promises by these were to be to partakers of the divine nature to what to come into His very nature the nature of what the nature of the Lamb amen and so that's what we're called to in this day and let's go to Ephesians 4 and we're going to look at the same thing in Ephesians chapter 4 because it's the work of the ministry now Ephesians 4:11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen the destination is clear what Journey are we on we're coming into His Image we're coming into the image of Christ we're coming into the image of the Lamb that's what the ministry is supposed to be producing for the edifying of the Body for the perfecting amen so they all come into a perfect man and until we come into the the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ what are we coming here Sunday and Wednesday and Sunday and Wednesday and Sunday and Wednesday why keep why are we doing this because the word is molding us into the very image and nature of the Lamb because we're the Lamb's wife and we must reflect the lamb and so we have to keep getting molded and molded Into His Image why because the destination is clear we're moving to the Capstone which is love which is God right God is love and he's got to bring us into his nature we must reflect on this Earth the nature of the Lamb because why we're the Lamb's wife and so we we can we can want to do so so many things and we can want to be so many things and we can think of a a a a great powerful move in the end time but the most powerful move that I can think of is God taking the people under absolute under control and having preeminence and doing only what he says amen not going off on our own ideas and not trying to conjure up our own and solve our own problems amen because that's not what the wife is to do she's to come submissive to her husband not to solve her own problem not to not not to take her own ideas but she's there as a help me to her husband Amen to take his vision and his plan and help manifest it and the home amen that's why I think it's it's so important amen that we understand what nature that we're under that if we're the Lamb's wife we're also a lamb amen uh do you remember the story that brother brandom told of those two young couples that he married we've talked to it many many times but the one was the rich couple one was the poor couple and he took the poor couple and he and they come to his uh front room and he married them in his front room and he was poor and she was poor and they didn't have a enough money to hire a preacher and and his brother doc told him my brother will do that and right and they come right into his living room and and they were shabby and she hardly had any shoes on at all or hardly had a dress no shoes on and and he married that couple and he's comparing and contrasting it with the rich couple but the part that always stands out to me is when he comes down to the to the point when he wants to check up on them and he goes along as as he acting like he says acting like he's checking the the electric poles and the insulators in the poles and and he gets up close and we know about the rich people they were fussing and they were fighting and they had everything but he comes up to this little home here that had nothing was in shambles and he and he starts to listen and he hears a conversation and he Peaks through the cracking the door and he sees her sitting on his lap and they've got an old hat turned upside down they got a little bit of money in there and they're counting so much money for groceries and so much for insurance and so much for that and brother bam said they didn't have enough to meet the ends and then he said oh I I want to buy you that dress so bad and she said oh I don't need a dress the one I got is fine and he says but you look so PR pretty in it and she goes oh I don't need it and brother M said when he looked through that CL crack she was sitting on his lap he had his arm around her she had her arm around him and they really loved one another and brother said he looked from there he could see the steeple on the house up on the hill and he said William Brandon which one would you want he said I take that character down here but what was it she took the same nature as her husband what happened on the hill amen that woman took the same nature as as her husband yes he was jealous he was spoiled he was selfish and what was she she was jealous and she was spoiled and she was selfish he chose one that reflected his character and then she was molded into his image and she was reflecting back to him what he was amen but this one down on the hill that's why I think it's so detrimental amen if you ever start criticizing your husband or start criticizing your wife amen you're on Dangerous Ground because you are to be one and you start tearing him down amen that's who you're supposed to reflect and you start tearing her down and she's your reflection oh my goodness what we need to do is get on our knees and say God help me get this right understanding amen cuz something's not working amen so now this little one down this this little couple down here she was a reflection of him he was sacrificing for her and she was SA sacrificing for him he didn't he didn't want a new fishing pole he didn't want new fishing lures he didn't want to take a vacation what he wanted to do with the little bit of money he had left over is he wanted to buy her a dress what was he doing he was sacrificing for her you know what she had the same nature of him she wasn't saying well just let the insurance go amen I'll take the dress that would have been the wrong nature that would have been the nature for the woman on the hill in the ivory Palace but she was reflecting her husband when he sacrificed for her she sacrificed for him and what did Christ do for you and I amen what should we do for him amen what right do I have to be selfish and take and never give back amen and want the showering of praises and all the things that come upon me but I don't want to give myself to the ministry and I don't want to give myself to Christ and I don't want to give myself for the furthering of the Kingdom help us Lord Jesus you know brother Brenham asked this couple before they got married he says what'll happen if you run out of work and you run out of money are you going to send her back to mom and dad he says no we'll struggle right along and he asked this young woman he says what'll happen if he loses his job and he can't take care of you anymore are you going to run back to Mom and Dad and she says no I'll stick with him and brother brandham said it made me feel little when I saw that they really loved each other so sad friends when Christ doesn't give us everything we want and we're willing to walk away when Christ doesn't answer every prayer request and we get angry and get upset when Christ doesn't give us everything we want and we start to pout yes and the question is which kind of wife am I reflecting the one on the hill or the one in the Box Car amen we've got to realize that I'm married to the lamb I'm not my own I'm not here for myself I'm not here to find my own way listen you know you know how horrible it is what a terrible picture it is when a man will come home and he's worked all that he can work and he's done all that he can do and and and his wife just wants more I want more furniture I want more Goods I want more this and I want more that and he says honey I've done all I can I can't do no more and she says well I'll just leave the house go get a job and I'll buy it for myself [Music] we've just marred the image of Christ in his bride why because you're taking it into your this is what the church has done they taken it into their hands to provide for themselves well we'll just have a program and we'll just have a school and we'll just do all of these things ourselves amen why they're not waiting on God to do it and if God doesn't do it saying hey that's fine with me if now's not the time if we don't have the money amen if if you decide Lord that it's not a good time for us to have this then we say you know best amen so we talk about you know you know brother brandham even preached on women working but he also he was balanced in all things he wasn't legalistic in it he he even commended amen a few women in his church who were working and they kept their honor and integrity even at the manufacturing PL and from the pull pit he gave them honor and respect for that but he said they were helping their husband build a house right so it's not about just it that's not it it's not about just working or not working what it's about is keeping the image right amen not making our own money so that we can make our own decisions I make my money I make my own decisions with the money I make that completely ruins the image of Christ in his bride that is the wrong kind of reflection so brother bandham when he was talking about these things he was talking about the image of Christ he was talking about why when he explained these things amen because the home must be a reflection of Christ and his every marriage must be a reflection of Christ and his bride amen but when we want to go provide for ourselves and we want to if we're told no and then no's not good enough I mean it it's it's detrimental and what it shows is everybody wants to be a bride nobody wants to be the wife remember I think I was thinking about this when brother Simon Abbott was here last last and brother Simon said everyone wants to be the queen but no one wants to bake the cake I was sitting in an airplane when I heard that and I was laughing out loud everyone be wants to be the queen but nobody wants nobody wants to do the hard work but Christ was willing to sacrifice for us amen we pull bad attitudes and yes people will leave church because they didn't get their way people will leave the message because they didn't get to do what they wanted because the message was a hindrance to what they wanted how is that the nature of the Lamb amen what about sacrificing when a woman comes to a marriage amen now she gives her body to this man why because he's going to make his family he's going to make his home and when she receives his child amen all of a sudden she's given herself completely over to this man he's going to reproduce himself and produce his family and she gives her body completely to it she gives up her Comfort she gives up her sleep her diet changes her body changes everything changes cuz she submitted to her husband and now to she's supporting the family the bringing forth of the family amen and she gives her she has to give her all to it what should we be doing amen for Christ to reproduce himself amen Christ has a bride and he wants to minister Amen to his children through his bride amen and we can't be selfish but we must give ourselves even giving ourselves to one another amen for the nurturing up of God's children amen what about sacrificing for each other Amen to make a home praise God you know brother Bram says in it's the rising of the sun said Satan doesn't care how religious you are how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again why you've got to have that life on display we know the quote really well out of Revelation CH 4 when he says Oh how we need in Jeff and build thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out sweetness and Holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil listen to what he just said amen when it hurts the devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God why that was the lamb Sanctified holy consecrated to God that's what hurt the devil that day what's going to hurt the devil today the same kind of life in her yeah what was in him being in her is what's going to shake the devil and then listen what he says say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil you say if I could preach like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts or somebody a great influential speaker oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing you get all the theology you wanted and all the Seminary training and the devil just sit back and laugh at it but when he sees that life what life the life of the Lamb where in her the same life reflected in her that's what he's trying to get preeminence to do now is he's trying to bring that life into a body he got preeminence in the lamb now is he going to pre pre have preeminence in the Lamb's wife I believe he will because he promised he would amen when I when I looked at this subject when I was thinking about it meditating on it I went back to the marriage vows and I looked back at the marriage vows that we take in in that that we use when we when we marry a man and a woman together and we we say I and whatever the bride's name take thee whatever the groom's name to be my wedded husband to haveen to hold from this day forward man that sounds so good I take you to be my husband to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part according to to God's holy ordinance and thereto I give thee my pledge what we do when we come to this marriage vow is we pledge to one another I'm not just here for the good times I'm not just here for the blessings and I'm not just here when it goes right but I pledge myself to you that I'm here for richer and I'm here for poor if you lose all your wealth I'm sticking with you amen like he asked that young woman amen what if what if your husband here what if he loses a job you going back to Mom and Dad she goes no I'll stick right with him if we go through poverty if we miss meals I'm not running away because I've pledged myself to him oh praise be to God how should we pledge ourselves to Christ amen only for richer only for better only for the benefits or are we here in the good times and the low times you know Christ didn't come to Earth just for the highlights amen he came down to be spit upon he came down to be rejected he came down to be mocked and why did he do it he did it for me he sacrificed for me and if the lamb sacrificed for me his wife the Lamb's wife ought to reflect his image right back to him oh praise God God help us Amen to come to the realization and the reality of this because I don't want to be a fair weather Christian I want to be the real deal amen if I pass through poverty with my Lord you say how could he he owns the cattle in the Thousand Hills but sometimes he's got to bring us down into the Valley Amen to move somewhere else and it comes down to a a a time of without a time of lacking a time of suffering amen and can I walk with him in a time of suffering the same I can walk with him in a time of blessing can I trust him the same can I stay submissive to his word the same or am I going to start getting discouraged and quit coming to church amen and start doing other things amen because why well I'm just so down because times are so tough and things are going wrong and nothing goes right for me and I got discouraged and I quit coming to church why did you give up on Christ he never gave up on you what about your pledge to be a wife and stop being a girlfriend and be a wife amen when times are tough don't leave your husband when times are good don't leave your husband in sickness and in health but I'm sick and he didn't heal me and I got discouraged and I quit coming why did you give up on him as is his word that tells you to come to the con congregation to the fellowship amen why dishonor him just because of a poor time or a sick time or a worse time does he not know how he's leading can we not trust him in All Things Christ suffered for me can I suffer for him he was rejected for me can I stand rejection for him if you've if you proclaimed this message long enough you've been rejected for it and this message is Christ he was rejected for me can I be rejected for him he was stepped on and he was mocked and he was made fun of and he was called be elub can I be called names for him it's it's coming down to the reality I yes I can't help it it's just the reality friends there's a there's a scripture that I've been meditating on that I want to bring to you but first I want to I want to go to a couple other places and then I'll get to the scripture in the in chrisis the mystery of God revealed brother B said Satan said he's talking about the temptation to Eve oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but the Eve in the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it listen the only hope I have the only hope I have in making it and not failing is cuz he predestinated me to make it and not fail not because I have any ability to do it myself but this is the hour we live in when his bride will be on display because she's predestinated not to yes sir God's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said this his church would be here without spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the Splendor of him his word manifest she'll be a token to the world she'll be a token to the world something that they can look at and then let's go to Second Corinthians now second Corinthians I still haven't got to the scripture I'm meditating on but we'll get there 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 2 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse ver two says ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ I love that the Epistle of Christ that means you're the letter Christ wrote To The World the epistle uh the epistle to the Ephesians is an epistle a letter of Paul to the Ephesians to the Corinthians but you're called to be the the Epistle of Christ the letter of Christ for as much as you're manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart what are we supposed to do we're supposed to be his love letter his letter his epistle written to the world not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not on Stone like it was on Mount Si but engraved in our hearts and we're to be a display of God's word now let's go over to First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 7 1 Corinthians 11:7 for a man that inde not not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man amen the woman is the glory of the man amen what kind of Glory should we be for him the woman is the glory of the man when we talk about the two couples that brother brandham married the woman on the hill was a reflection of her husband's character and she was declaring to the world what kind of man she was married to but the woman down in the Box Car she was a reflection of her husband's love and sacrifice and surrender and she was sacrificing and surrendering and loving back she was his glory amen when I read that story and I and I see her response you just know she had a good husband you just know she had a good husband she had a husband she loved a husband she could trust a husband who sacrificed for a husband she could have confidence and you know she has a good husband how do you know she has a good husband because she's refle ref in her husband her character reflects his character her conduct towards him is a reflection of his conduct towards her amen and what kind of Glory am I bringing Christ in my life amen I want to be a written epistle I want to be read of all men I I desperately want the Holy Ghost to come and write in my heart that letter so it can manifest not my own Glory not my own desire but his glory I want to be the Lamb's wife I want to be a lamb Amen in the Masterpiece brother bam says notice the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word of the bridegroom and then if the bride is is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also notice the bride must be why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is just a smitten piece off of him there is the Masterpiece she she must be a reflection of him if he was the word she must be the word word and now let's go to John chap 11 and I want to share with you this thing that I've been meditating on for weeks sometimes you just get a scripture in your mind and just roll over it and roll over it and roll over it and it begins to strike deeper and deeper in John 21 let's go to verse 18 and we know this is after the death burial resurrection of Jesus Christ he comes uh to find them fishing on the sea and he speaks to them and Peter swims the shore and all those then he starts to ask Peter Peter does thou lovest me more than these three times and he says feed my sheep then after that he speaks to to Peter again in verse 18 He says verily verily I say unto thee when thou was young thou Gest thyself and wst with thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall GD thee and carry thee G the Wither thou wouldest not he's speaking of his death because he's going to be crucified let's read that again say I say unto thee when thou was young thou Gest thyself and wst whether thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall GD thee and carry thee whether thou wouldest not because he's going to be crucified for Christ look at verse 19 this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify God so interesting to me that phrase starts getting in my heart and I can't get it out signifying by what death he should glorify God you mean Peter was going to glorify God by death by being crucified by being turned over to authorities by being tried as a criminal and being crucified that's how he was going to glorify God I wonder by what death I could glorify God maybe by the death itself we think the only way to bring glory to God is through Supernatural Feats and through all these other things but there was a death that Peter could go through that would glorify God and not Peter I started meditating on that and saying by what death he should glorify God and the woman is the glory of the man and if Christ sacrificed himself for me then what should I do to glorify him maybe I should sacrifice myself for him maybe I should reflect the nature of the lamb be led by the dove even Into the Wilderness to be tempted by the devil even to face Temptation even to face trials even in good times and bad times in richer and in poorer and sickness and in health if Peter could die a certain death to glorify God can I go through a trial to glorify God can I go through a hard time to glorify God can can God take me through a valley to glorify God is there more than one way to get Glory out of my life amen he got Glory out of Peter's life certainly certainly when when he when he healed the lame man amen Peter gave glory to God and God got glory in that when he walked by and they were healed by a shadow falling on them God got glory in that but that wasn't the only way he got glory in Peter's life because there was a death in which he signified what way in his death he could glorify God and that means I can bring glory to God not just in my successes not just in just in Supernatural things but I can glorify God even in the way I submit and surrender to his leadership and will for my life if that's what pet Peter gets to the point God already told him about his death God told him what way in which he could glorify God that's why when you read I think it's in second Peter when Peter talks about his departure it's no big deal for him he said my departure is coming near it's time for me to leave why cuz he knew that that was going to be glorifying God and he submitted to it he wasn't backing down he wasn't complaining he wasn't n leaving the ministry he didn't decide not to believe in the Messiah anymore he didn't protect himself defend himself he submitted himself maybe there's a death for me that I can glorify God maybe there's a manner in which I can crucify my own flesh and bring glorify glorify God amen maybe it's in more ways than just one and then I I love what happens next it's always amazing to me he said verse 19 again thus spake he signifying by what death he should glorify God and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me then Peter turned about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth thee Peter SE seeing him sayith to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do Jesus sayith unto him if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow thou me do you know that John brought glory to God but not the same way Peter brought glory to God God signified by what death that Peter could glorify God but you know that John didn't have to be crucified and John didn't have to die a martyr John was the only one of the disciples could die of old age amen and you say well maybe he didn't glorify God no God had a different way in which he could glorify God and it was different than the way Peter could glorify God and Jesus ends up saying what is that to thee follow me it doesn't matter and you say God how come you heal them and don't heal me how come they have a nice family and I have family troubles how come that's a good church and I'm stuck in this situation why do they get a good job and I don't get a good job what is that to you follow him just surrender to the headship of your husband amen if you need a good job he'll give you a good job amen and if he gives you a job that has some degree of suffering say praise God maybe in my death in this job I can bring glory to God maybe in whatever he has to me let it be to the glory of God maybe through the trial I can bring more glory to him than maybe in a in a in arousing testimony of a supernatural ball of fire per maybe it's actually walking through this Valley and submitting and surrendering and keeping the right attitude amen maybe that's how he wants me to glorify him maybe somebody else will do it by laying hands on a lame man and they leap and jump and walk maybe that's how they bring glory to God but maybe God's designed for me to bring glory to him to suffer through tribulation and trial and and and act like a lamb yeah amen we don't know but we know that God knows amen what's that to thee Peter's saying well if I have to be crucified what does he get if this is how I'm going to glorify you what's he going to do to glorify you and Jesus said don't you worry about that don't you worry about that you follow me am oh what a that little bitty few few verses there had got me all stirred up inside amen God if I've got to die let me die if you've got if I need to die to this situation or die to that situation or Surrender my will in this or my preference in that let me crucify the flesh if that's how you want me to bring glory to your name then let me be willing like Peter was at the end of his life and say hey now it's time what he said is going to come to pass it's time for my departure cuz why I want to have the nature of the Lamb oh friends I don't know sometimes I don't know why I even preach like I preach I want to preach happy things and and we're all this and that but there's a reality to our life amen and and the the when Jesus was on Earth amen he had campaigns and he had healings and they followed after and they wanted him but they also mocked him and made fun of him and spit on him and rejected him and took him in a mock trial and false accusations and and they and they rejected him as a whole nation and and they hung him on a cross and and and you talk about wholesale rejection amen but he submitted to it it wasn't always you know he glorified his father not just in the healing but also on Calvary when he was spit on and didn't spit back when he was riled against and didn't R back he was bringing glory to his father and we know testimonies bring glory to God we know the supernatural in our life brings glory to God and we want that but maybe our surrender and sacrifice also brings glory to God maybe our submission to the headship of the word even when it goes against the desire of the flesh glorifies God maybe when I submit myself to the headship of Christ and deny myself you know what I'm doing I'm reflecting the nature of the Lamb right because when Christ was on earth when Jesus Christ was here he surrendered to the will of the father and he only did that which the father showed himen and he goes to Gethsemane and he's wrestling with himself and brother bam brother bam so depicts it so beautifully if it wasn't for the prophet of God we wouldn't be able to say these things but the prophet of God says he's wrestling out will he will he go to Calvary or will he stay with his disciples what he wanted to do what he wanted to do he he himself wanted to stay with his disciples he didn't want the separation he didn't want the pain and suffering that came but or would he obey the father or would he stay with the disciples and do that's what he wanted to do but he wrestled it out till he says not my will but thine be done and what was he doing he's bringing glory to the father I say God let me bring Glory to you sometimes what's hard is he doesn't tell us ahead of time he told Peter when you're old you'll somebody else will G you they'll take you where you want to go they'll stretch your arms out and signifying what measure he might die by how he might glorify God sometimes he doesn't tell us ahead of time that you're going to go through a hard time and you're going to suffer and you're going to suffer a long time but the way you suffer is going to bring glory to me yeah the way you die listen if we remain on this Earth much longer before the translation of the body many of us are going to die make your death glorify God die in faith die believing die in Joy looking forward to step to the next Dimension glorify God in death glorify God in life glor glorify God in High Times glorify God in the low times glorify God in much glorify God without much glorify God in sickness glorify God in health that's right amen wa what right do we have to complain what right do we have to get selfish what right that's not the nature of the lamb and that's not what he's called us to reflect and we are the glory the woman's the glory of the man I want to bring glory to my husband and I want to bring glory to him by reflecting back to him his character because the kind of wife a man chooses reflects what's in him what his nature is and what he thinks of his future home and I believe by all my heart he's chose me so he must know that there's something down inside of me that can reflect his nature and so I know the potentials are there I just have to surrender myself and die to myself and say God by the power of your Holy Ghost would you bring out the reflection of you that must be in me because you chose me I didn't choose me you called me I didn't call me bride you said you're coming to unite with me you've come to me I didn't come to you all I did was say yay Lord that's what I want amen now I know that the wife you choose reflects what's inside of you and what you're thinking of your future home so God inside of me is your choice bring it to the surface Lord I Surrender Lord I Surrender bring it to the surface you know what we need we need we need the Holy Ghost to move in our lives every every day because this isn't something we can do on ourselves this isn't sure willpower this is something that we must resign ourselves to and say God I've got to die today I've got to Die Tomorrow I've got to Die the next day but you've got to come and live your own life because if not I'll be the wrong kind of reflection of your life and I don't want to hinder I don't want to bring a bag Mark against your name this this eve of the last is not going to fail because she's predestinated not to Something's already inside of her and he sent his word to draw it out I say God whatever glorifies your name let me glorify your name and the Masterpiece he says now closing in a few minutes I want you to notice real close of something that just happened Malachi 4 is to bring back to the original she is smitten from the church from the church body smitten with her master for the same purpose she is the word just the same as Joseph was smitten from his Brethren because he was the word and Jesus was smitten from his Brethren because he was the word the church is smitten the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word there's your stages again the word living in an action the Bible bride not some man made bride the Bible bride smitten and Afflicted of God now listen he goes right to Isaiah 53 which is speaking of Jesus which is speaking of the lamb and he applies it to the bride now he says the bride the Bible bride smitten and Afflicted of God no Beauty we should desire her but yet we did esteem her smitten and Afflicted of God that's right she stands alone she is smitten from all the denominations according to Revelation 3 she is smitten out of the lateran Church age that she was raised up in that's the church was raised up in the lateran church age that's the husk what you saying he says she is smitten and Afflicted of God rejected in the church AE rejected from the denominations and that's how he wants to be glorified in her in her rejection amen he was rejected will be rejected if he was the word we must be the word if the word's been rejected and ridiculed and mocked and made fun of and discredited then what do you think we should expect in our lives but if my husband is poor then I'm happy being poor if my husband is Rich I'm rich if my husband's going through a good time I'm going through a good time if he's going through a bad time I'm going through a bad time why because I've surrendered my life to him my identity is wrapped up in him if the word was rejected then I'll be rejected why because I'm part of him in the good times and in the bad times in Romans 8:35 let's turn there together I want to read just two more scriptures and we'll close Romans 8:35 says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter let's read it again you care if we go back and read it one more time I love asking that because I mean I don't think you're going to say no you might say it in your heart but not out loud because we think about being married to Christ and being healed and being rich and having the cattle on a thousand hills but but let's actually read what Paul says who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter he's a lamb we're Lambs amen nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord if none of those things will separate us from his love amen will we separate ourselves from him because of these things or will we stay with him in his love and Peril and nakedness and sword and being counted as sheep for the slaughter all the day long will we stay United with him if he goes to the Cross will we go to the cross if he goes into trial and tribulation will we go into trial will we let the dove lead us into the Wilderness to be tempted by the devil to bring glory to God or we say no that's not what I signed up for we go back to our vows I take thee Lord Jesus to be my wetted husband to have in to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poor and sickness and in health to love and to cherish I want all of that to be true in my love back to him nothing will separate his love from me I don't want anything to separate my love back for him let's go to Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chap 3:4 Philippians 3 and4 though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he have whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is the law blameless but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things that do count them but dung that I may win Christ what else do we want in this life but him and what else do we want to do in this life but glorify him and there's nothing else I desire but to glorify him and to reflect his nature amen but I know that it's going to take God coming and helping me but I believe that's the hour we live in isn't it not isn't this the hour for him to manifest himself in Bride form isn't that the hour we're living in is it we we we've talked about it so much we know that it's true but we were seeing it in power in demonstration in Revelation and all of these things but but to me if I'm going to see it there I've also got to see it in suffering and in rejection and in submission and in a lamb nature it's got to be both if I'm going to be his bride if I'm going to be his wife I've got to be able to take both sides everything that he is I am everything he goes through I go through amen his rejection is my rejection his success is my success and I want to be his glory and I want to glorify his name on this Earth the only way I can do it is to reflect back his character while I'm in this earth I never saw Jesus complained to God when somebody rejected him I never saw him complain to God When Trials came when he went to the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil I didn't see him blaming God or complaining to God I saw him submitting to the leadership of the dove and and obeying his father in all things did we see as a man wrestle in Geth yes he was a human being he wrestled in Gethsemane did we seem tired and need to all those things are true but but he submitted to the we will of the father and to the leadership of the father and what was he on Earth he was a reflection of his father he was God in flesh reflecting the very life of God what are we on this Earth the reflection of Jesus Christ Our husband and I want to be a good reflection you know the kind of wife I want to be the Box Car wife the Box Car wife I I'm okay I'm fine Lord everything you give me is wonderful I'm happy with you I'm happy with what you give me I'm pleased with the decisions you make for me I'm happy with your leadership I trust in you and I know whatever you lead is best and I'm giving all my faith and trust into you I want to be a box car wife I don't want to reflect the wrong nature amen let's all Stand Together there's many many more things that were on my heart but I'm going to save that for another time and just say that there's no way there's no way that a lamb can be married to a wolf there's no way the poor man from the box guard could have married the rich girl on the hill cuz he had to pick a wife that reflected his nature that's why Christ could couldn't take a modern denominational to be his wife that's what brother Benham said he couldn't do it he had to take one that would reflect his nature that would be humble and submissive and have faith and trust in him amen I'm so glad that he chose me I don't feel worthy of it and I don't feel like I'm I'm a good reflection but I know if I surrender to his life he'll come and do things in me that I can't do myself all I need to do is surrender to him I don't need to take it into my own hands I don't need to solve my own problems what I need to do is trust in him and let him lead amen let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you God for this day and Lord Jesus you told Peter by what death he can glorify you God it's an amazing scripture to me that things that look negative can bring glory to your name things that look bad can be a way in which we can bring glory to your name things that the world would call tragedy maybe a failure but God those are ways in which we can glorify your name when Peter would be tried as a criminal rejected by governments hung on a cross to die the world would call that failure but that's how you chose that he would glorify you God I I don't know what you have planned for our lives but God may we pledge ourselves to you for better and for worse for richer and for poor and sickness and in health Lord I'm sorry for pulling back in bad times when I got discouraged got down sorry Lord there even times Lord I tried to fix things myself and I didn't trust you like I should I wasn't as submissive as should have been when you said no I tried to find my own way and I'm sorry Lord but I want Lord with all my heart to be a lamb yes Lord I believe you've called me to be your bride in this hour I believe it lord I can't help but believe it God if I lay my life down would you pick it up and use it for your glory if I surrender to you would you get Glory out of my life Lord and God I pray that you encourage my faith draw out of me Lord all the attributes you've placed in and help me to be shaped into your very image to grow into your stature to the fullness of you Lord God may I be a reflection on this Earth of your life Lord and help me Lord to stay submissive and trusting to reflect you on this Earth to say Lord your way is the right way and your will is the best and what you choose is what I want God I pray that you'd put that in my life put that in my mouth put it in my mind help me submit to it Lord God there's times I've acted fussy and complaining and I repent for it Lord because I recognize every choice you've made for me is the right choice and every Valley you've took me through was needful and every trial was on purpose with an intent For Your Glory for my shaping to be molded into your image and I say God I'm thankful for everything that you have allowed in my life and I trust trust you in everything that has happened I trust you and everything that's happening Lord I trust you and everything that will happen I want to trust you Lord let your glory be made manifest in our surrender and God may we be your reflection on this Earth for that's what you your Prophet preached is the age that we live in and what you're trying to accomplish cuz you didn't finish all of your work in your Earthly Journey but you left some of it to do in and through your bride God I want to surrender to you so that you can finish that work in this day and that you can get all the glory I love you father I thank you Lord Jesus for your mercy for your graciousness God how can we not be patient in trial when you've been so patient with us how can we not endure with what you allow when you've endured with us for years and years years you've been patient with us how can we not reflect back to you patience and endurance God you've loved us even when things go wrong and when we've done wrong how can we not love you when things go wrong seemingly God how can we not reflect back to you the same love you've given to us God I love you I thank you and I trust you moving forward Lord we don't know what the future holds and what our what path our journey will take us no doubt many of us will go different ways for you had a path for Peter and a way at the end of his life he could glorify you but it was different for John and may each one of us maybe have a different way in which our surrender and our sacrifice of ourselves can bring glory to you but God help us not to look to the other help us not to compare but help us to look to you only and trust in you only for Lord all that you do is good and all that you do is right and you have a purpose and a plan in it all God we want to be a reflection of you on this Earth help us God I pray as we part and go our ways tonight may we walk out of here determined to make our pledge to you and to live it whether we understand or don't understand whether it feels good or doesn't feel good Lord we've pledged ourselves to
