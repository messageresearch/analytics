we're standing let's just take our bibles and go ahead and turn to the gospel of john and we'll turn to chapter 5. amen i just want to say god bless you brother mike and sister carolyn it's so very good to see you here today amen god is good and he's faithful praise the lord i enjoyed the specials today very much and thank god for the gifts that are in the body my sister tanya i really appreciate it sister dania's testimony that was amazing amen god is faithful god is wonderful god is supernatural and for us the supernatural is becoming a natural part of life amen praise be to god i'd like to read this scripture here in the gospel of john chapter 5 verse 39 john 5 and 39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me so we're going to continue on with part 11 in this series of search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me only we're taking it from from another angle jesus was here he was the word made manifest in his day and the word made manifest in his day was contending with religious leaders who refuting the things that he was saying and he tells them just search the scriptures amen the scriptures are testifying of me and now the bride is here is the word made manifest in this day amen and all kinds of spirits and religious leaders are trying to contest that but all you need to do is search the scriptures for they testify of who she is amen all the christ types when you look down through the bible and you and you see moses amen and you see joseph and you see all these christ types if you look you'll see a gentile bride there too there's always a type of the gentile bride along with the type of christ all the way down through and so we truly can say search the scriptures in them that's what you're resting eternal life on you're trusting your eternal destination on these words in this bible and it's the same words that are testifying of this bride hallelujah let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this day that you have allowed us to live in lord there's been no day like it lord there's no been no time like this time and we counted a privilege just to be walking on this earth at this time lord though we be in bodies of hybrid flesh we hold within us a promise for a change in the body this is the day this is the age that the satan will be ultimately defeated and the curse will be reversed and we are the people we believe lord that will be you lord putting satan under your feet in this bride at this end time lord we pray that you would bless and anoint the ministering of the word lord that you would just help me stay out of the way know that i could relax lord into the into your hands lord and you can take me into your hands and take this gift and use it for your glory bless us as a people to receive what you have for us today in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated praise the lord i just wanted to remind everybody that we're going to start wednesday night we start the tape service or the tape tape service for wednesday nights for the next couple

kyle will take the service here on sunday so keep him in prayer as well i know he'd appreciate it i'd appreciate him god bless you let's turn together to matthew chapter one we've been through these scriptures so many times i i looked and i believe this is number 11 in this series but we've had such a wonderful time looking through the first chapter of the book of matthew amen and so i'd like to just uh read the first six verses again and then we'll skip down and and pick up mary today we would like to talk about mary amen we've talked about these four women in this first six verses and we went through each one we've talked about tamar and and how tamar had come into the line of judah but but there was no conception no seed and and finally amen through the fourth stage of her journey she has to go back to the original seed which is judah himself and then she has to play the part of a harlot to do so and she goes back to the original seed giver him and not the sons but back to the original seed back to judah and she conceives judah's fourth child who gets the birthright amen who comes on down through the line then we come down to rahab the harlot of jericho and she's playing the part of harlot she's a gentile amen but when they come to possess the land because of her faith in the message of her hour of her day she is spared and she's given a true token and all that will believe her and come under that token are spared as well and then she's taken outside the city and and she's outside of denominations she's outside of the camp of israel amen but there's a prince in the house of judah this same bloodline that's coming all the way down the line of david coming all the way down to christ amen right in there there's a prince named salmon and salmon takes a stroll one day outside the camp amen because we meet him outside the camp amen he was crucified outside the camp and we meet him outside the camp and these two meet and they're married and now solomon the prince of the house of judah one of the most eligible bachelors of his day takes the harlot of jericho probably probably one of the most gossiped about events in all the camp of israel probably one of the most misunderstood acts that was taking place in that day that people couldn't imagine amen we've got a commandment we're not supposed to do these things moses has told us not to marry outside of israel and now here's solomon amen he is the prince of the house of judah he's in the line of the birthright and can you imagine all the talking that was going on all over him and at the dinner tables at the quiet times at the well amen at the gatherings they're they're all but it's god amen god's painting a picture god's laying a shadow amen so that he was foreshadowing things that are to come amen in that day it was probably the most misunderstood event of the day but it's the very thing that we can look back on and say see there it is search the scriptures they are they that testify of me no matter what my condition no matter what denomination belief i had no matter what amen no matter what i have i have been feasting on and what i have been believing that was false amen there comes a time that i can meet christ outside the camp amen and through marriage i can be justified and brought into the camp and so now these things that we we read through these scriptures and it's so easy just to read scripture scriptures are easy to read but they were hard to live i mean it's easy to read through tamar i mean you can just read right through it it doesn't take very long by the time you're done it's a happy ending but when it was being fleshed out when the scriptures were being lived it wasn't that easy for tamar it wasn't that easy for rahab it wasn't that easy for ruth and naomi amen they were misunderstood they were misjudged amen they didn't know themselves sometimes what was going on in their lives they didn't know why they had fallen into these situations why life had taken the turns it had taken why they were in catastrophe why they were in chaos why they were in trouble and the whole reason is for you and i here today they're passing through troubles they're passing through trials and what's happening god is writing his bible [Applause] tamar amen first husband he's evil and wicked and he dies amen do you know what that experience is like for a woman and then she's married she's going to have a family and her husband dies these aren't easy things then she's going down and now the the second one who's going to come and the the second son is going to raise up seed now she's going to have a heritage she's going to have a son named that's going to take care of her she's going to have provisions and now he refuses now she sent back to her father's house waiting for the third son but judah refuses to give the third son amen and now she's she's in trouble i mean she's in tribulation she has no heritage she has she has nothing amen for the future so she does something that seems impossible to be done in a righteous line seems like there's no way god is going to honor what tamar will do but tamar will dress up like a harlot and deceive her father-in-law judah into lying with her so that she can see seed and then to raise up amen a son unto judah to replace the one that was refused her and seemingly this is there's no way god can write his bible this way but that's how he wrote it it seems like if if i may have said this before but if i was god and i was writing the bible i would write it differently but i guess if i was god i'd write it the same way because i'd be god if i was god with the mind i have now with the temperament i have now with the carnality that is embedded in me right now they would be clean i would leave out all the bad parts i would make it look so nice and you would read the bible that i would write and you'd be like they were all perfect people amen hallelujah it's like you know so many people on facebook you know all you're getting is the highlights i mean all you're getting is the golden stuff all you get is like the perfect family stuff everybody smiling in front of you know in front of the lighthouse on the beach they don't take pictures or record the argument on the way there because somebody crossed the line in the seat and his legs on my side all right we don't tell the whole story but god told the whole story because he's laying a shadow right he he's laying a shadow that is so misunderstood in the day that it's happening the levites may not have understood what salman was doing can you imagine the good advice he must have had from so many friends can you imagine the conversations he had with concerned clergy [Music] solomon d i mean do you know that the birthrights do you know that you're going to pollute the bloodline do you know this is a harlot in jericho not of israel she didn't come from jacob do you know that we're not supposed to do this amen and maybe solomon had no explanation maybe solomon couldn't defend himself maybe all he could say is i don't know i just know this is right how is it right show me where moses said let just just just tell me how it's right i don't know i just know it's right hallelujah so solomon takes rahab amen and no doubt there was a mystery surrounding that and it might have been scandalous in that day so the bible the writing of the bible was not clean and it was not easy and they weren't just skipping through the land amen and everything was wonderful as god was telling these stories and writing out his bible it came through hardship it came through misunderstanding it came through false accusations but god had his way nonetheless in in and solomon and rahab would have a son named obed and obed would be a great man in bethlehem and we know solomon and rahab would establish amen established the city or the village of bethlehem and bethlehem was going to be the place where christ was going to be born the house of god's bread and they established bethlehem and then boaz comes up and is a great man in bethlehem and how is it that boaz the most eligible man in bethlehem he was a great man he was a wealthy man no doubt that there were maidens in that day they would have loved to have snagged boaz right but maybe boaz was the ugliest man in bethlehem i don't know but something somehow we find that boaz is not married and has no amen he has he has no birthright son to take his place amen in the story of naomi and ruth coming into the land you find that elimelech leads his family out of the promised land into moab why did he do that who knows was it right no it was wrong but it was right it was wrong he was told not to do it he wasn't supposed to do it a jew was never blessed outside of his homeland outside of his portion of land he shouldn't have done it but yet he had to do it you see because there's got to be a story a of naomi coming back into the land and as she's coming back into the land there's got to be a gentile bride coming back with her who is going to unite with the kinsmen redeemer it has to happen this way this is the way the bible has to be wrote and a lima like may not know why he's doing what he's doing and does elimelech suffer for it he suffers for it see what we have amen in just a few verses is we have a hard life lived we have people who live through difficult circumstances so that you and i could say search the scriptures they are they that testify of me [Applause] all these things happen for our examples apostle paul he comes and he says now now don't be like those in the wilderness who lusted after flesh and lust and don't do this and don't do that and these things were given for our examples these things happen he says for our example they didn't happen for them they happened for us ray apple was not a harlot for herself she was a harlot for me amen naomi and ruth weren't destitute for them they were destitute for me amen ruth wasn't wasn't forsaken amen she wasn't destitute and going back in poverty back with her mother-in-law with no hope of the future for her she went through that for me hallelujah and if that's god how how god wrote his bible amen to foreshadow what's happening today what do you think it's going to be like to live this word today is it going to be easy no is there going to be misunderstandings absolutely are there going to be concerned clergy absolutely will there be things that look wrong but are right absolutely that's the way it's going to be that's the way the shadow is laid down it's being fleshed out the same way today amen you live a misunderstood life praise be to god i'm in good company misjudged amen doing things that don't always make sense amen moving in places and going ways that don't seem to make sense having trouble amen hit us and drive us in the places we don't want to be amen but god if he did that to lay down the shadow now when it comes time for the reality to be displayed on this earth he's going to do the same things amen strike us in ways we don't want to be stricken smitten us in ways we don't want to be smitten move us into positions in places we don't want to be why because now it's time to display what the shadow's been foreshowing then obed now takes ruth and you know roots of there was another nearer kinsman amen that wanted to redeem naomi's land wanted the inheritance but he said if you get the inheritance you have to take the moabitess to raise up seed to the dead and he says i don't want that i don't want her amen ruth wasn't something that they were all seeking after amen amen they she was she was rejected because of marring the inheritance but obed wasn't concerned about marring his inheritance he was willing to share his inheritance and he made ruth a joint heir because christ is not worried about marrying his inheritance by taking you and i amen he's not marring his inheritance by taking you and i he's willing to share his inheritance and make us a joint heir amen and then ruthing boaz have obed and obed begins becomes a a restorer of life and inertia of old age to naomi and obed is given to naomi and naomi becomes the foster mother of obed and you never hear anything more about ruth amen because this this gentile message will go back to the jews oh all of this god is foreshadowing our day and then we go a little further obed begets jesse jessica gets david and david begets salman of her that was the wife of uriah then you move into a scandal in the kingdom where david does something so scandalous he takes another man's wife and has the man murdered and tries to cover up what he's done and we've been through this and you understand it well but through the scandal through the wrong god is foreshadowing our day and you think it was easy for bathsheba we know it wasn't easy for uriah it wasn't easy for bathsheba it wasn't easy for david it wasn't easy for the kingdom it wasn't easy for those that were around and witnessed this it was a confusing time could you imagine working for david and you're watching all this happen as a servant you see her come you see her go you see a message relayed amen and you hear about what happened and you start to piece together what's going on can you imagine what it would be like to live in that day this is your king but god is writing his bible let's read matthew chapter 1 verse 1. the book of degeneration of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham begot isaac and isaac begot jacob and jacob begot judas and his brethren and judas begot pharas and zerzera of tamar tamar is the first woman mentioned in this lineage and pharas begat ezram and ezram begat aram and aram began a meena dab and amina debbie got neyasan and naasembe got salman and salman begot boaz of rahab second woman mentioned and boazby got obed of ruth third woman mentioned and obed begot jesse and jesse begot david the king and david the king begot solomon solomon of her that had been wife of urias third woman or fourth woman mentioned this is bathsheba so in the first six verses coming to solomon we have four gentile women and the four gentile women and then after this there's no more gentile women listed so right here clustered in these first few verses are these gentile women because we have four stages amen of the wheat plant coming back to life we have four uh we have four anointings on the church ages amen so we have this four the number of deliverance also four amen is his number back to seed and so solomon is a type of christ and and in solomon's day he brought them to the golden age of israel brother branham said a type of the millennial reign of christ and so now solomon is a type of christ bring him to the millennium so now you see there's four gentile women used to bring about christ in the millennium in typing in shadow and from that point on israel was downhill that was the highest point for the nation that was the highest point for their spirituality that was the highest point for their peace and their prosperity amen and their world influence that was the highest point and from then on it slips downhill and there's not a gentile woman mentioned in the slipping downhill the gentiles are mentioned in the building of the kingdom of the type of christ god is foreshadowing in the first six verses what the entire new testament is about it's about these gentile women coming through the church ages building back to christ coming in a millennium sitting on the throne of his father david hallelujah so then we go through we read down and there's many more verses it's all this one begot this one this one begot that one no more women mentioned but there's another woman mentioned in the first chapter of matthew that we haven't talked about yet and we'll pick it up in verse 16. and jacob begot joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ so here we have the fifth woman who's mentioned in the genealogy of jesus christ and this woman is mary the virgin let's read it again and jacob begot joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who was called christ so all the generations from abraham to david are 14 generations and from david until the carrying away into babylon are 14 generations from the carrying away in babylon unto christ are 14 generations now the birth of christ was on this wise when is his when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph the son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost so that makes the holy ghost jesus father amen he didn't have two fathers he only had one and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done then it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the prophet of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name immanuel which being interpreted is god with us then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus so now we want to look today at mary and mary mary is the number five she's the fifth woman mentioned in this genealogy and brother branham tells us five is the number of grace so this is the nut this is miss grace this is the elect lady amen brother branham says in well no let's look at luke let's let's take this same story over in luke chapter one you turn with me to the gospel of luke chapter one and we'll begin reading in verse 26. and in the sixth month i love that because what did the six seals reveal the seventh hallelujah in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women now let's imagine like i said before let's not just read the scripture and be like oh that's a neat story in the story book but no here's here's a virgin girl this is a this is a young woman a very young woman brother benham says and she's engaged to a man named joseph and and now she she's brother bam says she went to the well fetching some water amen and she's in the city of galilee named nazareth and in galilee a city named nazareth amen and he come to a virgin espouse to a man verse 27 whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women now has that ever happened to you can you imagine the astonishment the shock the wonder look at the next verse and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a sign and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her so this is this is super interesting and i want to look at this first i want to go back and i want to look at the uh i want to look at verse 28 let's go verse 28 together and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored this word highly favored amen in the greek it is i don't even know how to say these keritu i think but it says to be highly favored it's used twice one is interpreted to be highly favored the other is to make accepted to pursue with grace to compass with favor to honor with blessings so this is something god was doing to her not something she had done or earned highly favored the question is how did she get highly favored the bible doesn't say the bible gives us nothing that mary did it didn't say that she was upright in conduct it didn't say that she had lived virtuous we know she's a virgin but it didn't say you know that she where she had come from how many times a week she went to synagogue it didn't talk about her prayers and her fastings or her own giving amen there's no discussion on what mary did to put herself in this position amen it's nothing more than the declaration of the mind of god concerning her amen and he said thou art highly favored amen thou has been made accepted amen and he goes on they are highly favored the lord is with thee not the lord will come to you the lord is with thee now she hadn't conceived yet she had this event hadn't take place yet but still the lord was with her amen and and and do you think that the lord has not been with every seed amen that's been traveling through life amen do you think the lord wasn't with rahab rahab is living a life of prostitution and harlotry amen but the lord knows right where she is amen the lord's watching over her do you think rahab may not have had opportunity to die at some point but god preserved her life amen something would have happened maybe in her childhood something in her adulthood but god is saving her for a specific purpose because she's a predestinated womb to bring forth amen boaz nothing's going to happen to her the lord is watching over her and now mary comes to a position where there's an angel that says you're highly favored and the lord is with thee can you imagine mary looking around amen like so many of us do when we start thinking of natural things i haven't seen him i was here alone i've been walking alone for so long and the angel's saying you've met you've not recognized the presence of the lord the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women when she saw him she was troubled and is saying cast in her mind what manner of salutation it should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god this word favor in the bible is i don't know karis carey's c-h-a-r-i-s but it is interpreted a hundred and thirty times as grace a hundred thirty times in the new testament this words in type and interpreted grace and it's interpreted favor six times so let's look at this this again verse 30 and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found grace with god and this word found i mean it's an interesting word found because the word found here in the greek it can it means to come upon to hit upon to meet with and it can mean after searching to find a thing sought or without previous searching defined by chance to fall in with so now there's a certain kind of found where you know i i've lost my pen you know and so i'm looking around i'm actively searching and i'm looking for a pen and when i find it hey i found my pen but there's another kind of found amen where without any searching amen you just come in contact with the thing without you searching without you looking you just meet with it you just come in contact with it and this is what happened to mary mary wasn't looking for this amen this came to her [Applause] how many of you were looking for the message of the hour when it came across your path how many of you were thinking oh god there needs to be a prophet in this day you're going to have a bride amen show me where this great prophet of malachi 4 is you weren't looking for it but grace found you you found grace with god you've come in contact with the grace when did the grace show up amen when you decided to believe the message no way when you made a decision that you're going to believe the word and all of a sudden grace was poured on you had grace from before the foundation of the world when your name was recorded in the lamb's book of life and sealed there amen grace was already amen it was already given to you there come a point when you found grace with god you came in contact you met with you stumbled upon god wasn't stumbling he knew just how to give it to you but for you it came as a surprise for you you weren't certain for you it was as if it was just by chance i met somebody at work and i had a friend and he gave me a tape and he gave me a book and he invited me to church it was just it just happened but with god it didn't just happen god's been watching for you amen hallelujah amen and so the angel goes on to describe that she's going to have a son and name's jesus he's going to be son of the highest have the throne of his father david verse 33 and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man. now i want you to understand mary is not doubting that she's going to have a son and she's not doubting his name will be jesus she's not doubting he'll be the son of the most high she's not doubting that he'll sit on the throne of his father david she's just curious how it's going to work she never questioned what the angel said she wants to know how it's going to be there's so many things in life that you hear the prophet say amen you don't question that he said that and you're the one that's going to do it there's going to be a manifestation it's going to come through you the son of man minister in the bride but sometimes you're like how is it going to happen not that i'm doubting it i know it's going to happen but how's it going to happen mary didn't have a spirit of doubt upon her she was asking a question and because all she knows is natural things all she knows is a natural life amen and in a natural life it takes a man and a woman amen to bring forth a baby she's not questioning whether there's going to be a baby you realize that she's not doubting that there's not going to be a son she's not downing he won't be the son of the most high she's not doubting he'll take the throne of david she's asking how will it be so look at the angel and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee because he's been bound by chains and dogmas and denominational challenge chains for nearly two thousand years but he's going to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time messenger the holy ghost back on the people again the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born and thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who is called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her mary had never seen this happen before there is no example in the bible of a woman conceiving without a man but she believed it see mary is the fifth woman and mary is lady grace thou art highly favored thou hast found grace with god and brother bam says in the invisible union of the bride of christ in 1965 man i add to this woman grace may i place her in the bible also is called the elect lady this misgrace i'm going to talk about no the bible declares now the bible declares to the elect lady that if you notice elect come from the word elected lady one lady amongst all other ladies was elected like the virgin was to bring forth the body of god on the earth she was an elected woman god chose mary mary didn't choose god we got to understand this mary was just going about her business mary was just doing what mary did mary didn't choose god mary you know no doubt mary had heard about the prophecy a virgin shall conceive and when she lives in israel she must have heard that out of isaiah chapter 7. she must have heard isaiah 9 and 6 a son is born she must have known those scriptures amen but she may have never dreamed in her wildest dreams that she would be the one to fulfill that scripture she wasn't looking for god to fulfill that in her she was just going about her business but she was ordained before the foundation of the world to be the womb that would bring forth christ she's walking misgrace one woman amongst all other women there's no woman like this and you can't earn this position i want to ask if there was any way amen if there was any way to earn the position the the girls in israel would be lining up amen running obstacle courses doing whatever kind of training they had to do or whatever kind of purification to take this privilege amen but there was not an earthly thing that could be done to be this woman no matter how hard you tried no matter how hard you fasted no matter how hard you prayed you could never take this scripture upon yourself it doesn't matter how much you see the need for it amen you can say we really need that deliverer now amen and i'm a virgin and i want it to happen i'm going to go on a 30-day fast i'm going to go on a 40-day fast i'm going to live pure and clean i'm not i'm going to go into a cave and i'm not going to come out there's nothing you can do to be this miss grace she's just living she's just walking she's just living a normal life amen and the angel comes to her to identify who she is to her because she doesn't know who she is she can read isaiah 7 the virgin a council conceived she doesn't know she's the virgin it's going to take an angel to identify who she is [Music] hallelujah and then the angel begins to tell her the the fulfillment of the scripture because to say have a son name jesus and she is this is it this is it amen and she's not asking she's not saying that's not possible it can't be jesus it can't be me she never says that friends all she says is wow now how is that going to happen hallelujah and the angel explains to her the holy ghost shall overshadow you brother braham goes on to say invisible union like the virgin was to bring forth the body of god on earth she was an elected woman god chose mary and also god has chosen an elected lady which is his bride she's elected i hope we're members of that tonight across the world across the nation rather the illustration here shows the relationship of the bride to christ the elect lady and how she was to be brought to him where she would come from and how that she would be brought to him the church here an illustration that we got in view is illustrated by a woman which a woman is always a type of the church because the church is considered a bride a bride she is the bride of the lord jesus the son of god and this bride amen is just as predestinated as mary was if you're in this bride you were every bit as predestinated as mary was and mary was predestinated okay so mary's the predestinated one she's the woman that's going to bring forth christ there's nobody else in the world there's nobody else past amen present or future there's no other hope for the salvation of the world but mary bringing forth you understand god doesn't change his predestinated will if mary wasn't the one he wasn't going to get another one she's the one and mary's walking along living her life and now she's been predestinated before the foundation of the world she's come from the mind of god but she's in spiritual amnesia she has no idea she came from the mind of god she has no idea she's the one to bring forth christ in her day she doesn't know she's just hoping to have a good marriage to joseph raise some babies have a nice family live a life without a bunch of sickness and hardship and die someday she's not planning on being the virgin she's not hoping to be the one she's just living life so it's not mary's responsibility to come in contact with the angel it's not mary's responsibility to conceive what can she do mary's not responsible to bring forth for bringing forth the word mary's not responsible to bring forth the word of god amen marries the chosen one all she's doing is walking and at some point it's god's responsibility to meet her to with an angel and an angel to identify to her who she is amen and then there's a c gene of eternal life down in there that's going to say be it unto me according to your word see just like this day there's an elect lady to be the bride of jesus christ amen we've many of us just lived our life just did our thing had no hope no desire no thought of being that elect lady but we were just as predestinated as mary and it wasn't our responsibility to find the message of the hour it was god's responsibility to bring an angel into our path to identify who we are in the day we're living in and what scriptures were to manifest amen it's not our job to question it you may say wow that's amazing i can't see how that would work but i believe it we finally say just just we come to terms with the fact i may never understand how it's going to work mechanically i may never understand how it's going to work naturally with physics and chemistry and all this but i can say be it unto me according to your word amen amen and amen now brother brahm says in the message of grace 1961 he said think of it love and grace is sisters twin sisters you can't have grace without having love why because he extends grace to whom he's already loved and how do you know his love his love is elected love god's love is elective love who he's chose before the foundation of the world amen you can't have grace without having love they're twin sisters they're exactly right before you can have grace you have to have love before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't that means mary was loved before she met the angel that means mary was the was the object of god's love before she said be it unto me before she responded to the word amen he can never say amen that you found favor you found grace he can never say that you're highly favored that grace is put upon you he can't say that unless love is already extended to her so you were the object of god's love before you believed his word [Music] hallelujah i love it before you can show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't see so love and grace is the same thing they're just twin sisters that's all love and grace we can't see one without the others god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he shed his grace abroad in our hearts through the holy ghost see there's just nothing you can do without working one with the other grace grace of god this is what saves us and so mary is lady grace i want to i want to look at something in the in the life of brother branham if we go back to the to february of 1962 we know the seals are going to be open in march of 1963 he's going to preach the seal series but a year before that in 1962 he's preaching february 4th right in the beginning of february so right along this time of the year he's preaching in a message titled communion he says we see that the astronomers are predicting sometime in this early part of the first part of the month beginning on the second or the fifth or somewhere along this month the indian astronomers predict the world to blow to pieces and the american newspapers make fun of it i do not believe the world's going to blow to pieces but i do say it's wrong to make fun of it so here's brother branham and what he's referring to is there's newspaper articles out that there's going to be an alignment of five planets something that brother man's gonna say hadn't happened for like 25 000 years or something like that amen and there's indian astronomers saying the world's going to blow up there's a prediction or something like that amen and he says the american papers are making fun of it he says now i don't believe the world's going to blow up but i think it's wrong to make fun of it amen then he goes on to say because some things fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that when the five planets mars jupiter venus and so forth comes into their they never have did it oh they claimed maybe 25 000 years ago but who was back there to know it i predict that this is a spiritual application 1962 early february i predict this as a spiritual application i believe it's the coming in of the issue of god that the great revelations of the word will be opened during this time this is before sirs is this the time this is before the visions this is before all of this happens that sends him out west amen to see a visitation of seven angels before any of that that happens in december here we are in february of that year before that he's already looking at an alignment of five planets and he's saying it has a spiritual application and it's the issue of god the great revelations of the word will be open during this time he's exactly right remember they claim it was three stars come in their orbits when jesus was born and this is five and five is grace the number of grace three is the number of perfection five is the number of grace jesus j-e-s-u-s five grace g-r-a-c-e faith f-a-i-t-h so forth number of grace god never sends his power to the church it'll be his god ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace it won't be the obedience of the people so god is showing an alignment of five planets in the heavens and is making the newspapers and there's predictions and all of that that's why amen friends we've got we've got all kinds of signs in the heavens going on we've got blood moons and this and eclipses and all of that and you rest assured there's a spiritual application don't make fun of it but don't you go probing either because you're not a prophet without a prophet you're going to have all kinds of chaos and theories and all of this going on and all we're going to do is just hurt the cause of christ all we can say is there's a spiritual application god shows it in the heavens first before he declares it on earth it's got a spiritual application things are happening and things are happening in the heavenly bodies all the time it's making the news all the time and i don't understand because when i was growing up amen in the last few years it didn't seem like all these astronomical events had so much impact on the news i don't know if some of you watched more news than me over the last 30 or 40 years but it seems like all of a sudden it's like constantly there's an eclipse there's a blood moon there's a super wolf blood moon there's a blah blah blah blah blah because spiritual things are taking place that's all we can say spiritual things are taking place on the earth i can't tell you what they are and this one means that and this one lies that i can't tell you that all i can tell you spiritual things are taking place on the earth and they're taking place quickly we go from one astronomical event to another to another to another that means this bride must be moving into position that means israel must be moving into position that means things are lining up quickly hallelujah he says now grace god ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace it won't be the obedience of the people i want to ask you a question who lined those five planets up and how long ago were they set in a cycle that would bring them to an alignment millions i don't know billions i don't know how many years so many years ago when god set the heavenly bodies in their place and began to move them into the heavenly dance where they would move about amen in a certain time all the way back whenever he did that he knew that in 1962 that there was going to be five planets that would line up because now it was time for something to take place on the earth do you think things are just happening and you're in my life you think that these are accidents and random events and wow that was odd that that happened to me things have been ordained from before the foundation of the world are beginning to take place it won't be it'll be his grace it won't be the obedience of the people now think about this back when god lined up three stars brother brenham said to look like one for the magi to see it's the three offices of god coming into one amen into jesus christ and he said that all the way back however long ago he put them in orbit they lined up how did he know that mary would believe how did he know there would be a virgin on earth that would believe amen her position was secured before the stars were put in place her position her works what she's ordained to was placed in his book before the stars were placed in the sky that's why it has to be by grace amen it can't be dependent on your works because he's already ordained it so he's already said it would be so it's already taken place in his mind he's already placed it in the heavenly bodies and he's not going to change it just because you've lived like a harlot in jericho for so many years he's not going to change it just because italy malek left the land amen and naomi went destitute and the sons marry a moabite woman and they got to come back for he's not changing his plan because of the circumstances he's not waiting to see what you will do to see if he will work his plan he has already worked his plan the heavenly bodies are already set and the scripture says he declares it in heaven before he does earth and the heavens have been set how long have the heavens been set in fixed position and timing of rotation it's already said it's already done in the mind of god and you're here fleshing out what has already been said it's by his grace not by the obedience of the people if he had to wait for us he would have had to wait until after you're born let's put it this way he would have to wait till after mary was born to see what kind of girl mary was to see if she was suitable and then create some stars amen oh i hope i don't miss the rapture are you kidding me don't ever say that again if you have the possibility of missing the rapture you are guaranteed to miss the rapture if it is possible for you to miss the rapture then you're guaranteed to miss the rapture do you think god's going to wait and decide who he's going to rapture and wait and see okay yeah they've done pretty good check they're in the he already knows who's going to take that heavenly flight and the body he already knows who's going to slip dimensions in the translation of the body it's already fixed you're not going to miss the rapture if you're a child of god a sieging of god that was in his mind before the foundation of the world you will not miss the rapture that's a scare tactic of the devil that's a scarecrow when the devil comes with that you just say boo devil you fell in sin you had an evil thought you said something you told a lie and when you were under pressure maybe you'll miss the rapture the rapture me making the rapture wasn't dependent on me never lying meeking the rapture was not dependent on my obedience making the rapture was his grace amen that come from his love amen that was extended when he wrote the book [Applause] hallelujah how could mary miss it she couldn't miss it it came to her how could she not believe it she had something inside her to believe it with all the ingredients were present the heavenly bodies were moving and she was moving under the influence [Music] it was wrote in god's mind amen it was wrote in the heavenly bodies it was wrote in the pyramid it was wrote in the bible and now it's being written upon the earth in mary's life and they all have to match there's going to be no discrepancy hallelujah still in the same message february 1962. 5's number of grace it'll be his grace it won't be the obedience of the people and isaiah said in the 40th chapter how to cry to jerusalem that her warfare was over yet she was guilty of idolatry but it was god's grace that was sending him god sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not our merits so it may mean something i predict that there'll be a change i don't know what it'll be but i believe it's fixing to happen we're we're right on the eve of it now so brother venom is a prophet in the land he's seeing the alignment of stars he's saying five is grace something's grace something's happened the issue of god is coming forth the word's being restored in this day it won't be by your merits to be by his grace i believe it's happening don't know what it is but it's fixing to happen we're right on the eve of it now praise god let's go to romans chapter 11. i just want to lay down this grace real tight here romans chapter 11. romans chapter 11 verse 5. even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace he's talking about the jews the jews didn't believe christ but even yet in their unbelief there's a there's an election according to grace there's a remnant according to the election of grace and if by grace then it is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then israel has not obtained what they seek for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded i see the message i see the light i'm walking in the light why because of grace not because of merit we couldn't do anything to earn it there's no way so brother branham 62 february 4th in the communion message he's talking about these stars then he comes the next month in march march 18th he preaches a a very pivotal very powerful message he preaches the spoken word is the original seed so what he reads yeah spoken word of the original seed and he says there's been three seeds planted he says there's been the evangelical seed plan and the pentecostal seed's been planted and he says and the word's been planted now the planting is done now watch what comes forth he's talking about the diminishing of the revival meetings the diminishing of the healing means and he's saying that was just there to get the seed sown there's been three seeds now watch amen watch what these seeds bring forth they're going to begin to bring forth a harvest of what's been planted so now he comes the next day after that message which is march 19 1962 and he preaches a message called the end time sign seed next day he said three is the number of perfection we all know that three is god's number in his numerology god is known by his numbers three is perfection seven is worship 24 is worship 40 is temptation 50 is pentecost jubilee so forth all of his numbers his numerals of god is perfected is in perfection now three is the number of perfection just before now listen now close when the little baby christ was born three stars went together and made the one morning star that reflected the coming of an infant christ a perfect one now what's happened so he points back to when christ was born when the infant baby christ was born there was a lineman of three stars now what's happened we see a roar in the paper across the television out across a nation where five stars just fell in line with the world what's five a number of grace every time those stars come then something happens on earth what taken place five stars fell in what is it an introduction of what when three came together introduced introduced baby christ now five has come together the number of grace they've lined up what it's introducing what that's his question what's being introduced since then just look what's taken place germany almost washed off the map some of the magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon every distressful things prophesied by them for the last days look what's taken place england the other day had a storm that blowed away 70 thousand houses one day disasters everywhere california los angeles like to wash into the ocean what is it beginning of sorrows i thought this was grace number five going together grace but now all these natural disasters are happening under the line and the stars he says the beginning of sorrows earthquakes is picked up everywhere why is it so he starts showing all the natural how the earth is responding to these five stars lining up and he says what is it five stars come in line grace god's grace what's happened an infant church a bride infancy that the power of god has begun to fall on her she's taking form a bride for the bridegroom so here brother branham in february 62 is reading the newspaper seeing the alignment of stars hearing what the magi are saying and he's saying i believe he has a spiritual application i believe the word's coming forth now amen don't know what's happening but we're right on the eve of it he comes to march 18th 1962 a month later and he speaks preachers spoken where's the original seed he says now look the seeds are planted now watch what comes forth the next day in time sign seas he goes back to the five stars which a month earlier he said he couldn't determine exactly what it was but now after spoken word is the original seed he comes and said what is the five stars announcing what is it an infant church a bride coming forth and you think you can mess up this plan and you think that sometimes how we can derail the stars have the planets have lined up to bring it forth an infant church a bride infancy that the power of god has begun to fall on her she's taking form a bride for this brideground that three stars meant his perfection of the heavenly father of the trinity becoming one on earth among us god's office is becoming one office what happened now it's the church of the living god coming together under the word of god and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach amen might not believe that but it's the word just the same what are you going to do with that you might not believe that but that's the word just the same brother benjamin is announcing and all heaven is moving at this announcement that an infant church of bride is coming forth a bride for his bridegroom it's announcing the approach of it now brother branham comes into the message uh in the church age book in pergamon church age he says the second son jesus also a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like was adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she's a virgin of his word she's a virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin whatever was promised before is going to happen now the word of promise came to the virgin mary but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest so mary didn't just get a word the promised word came to mary through an angel but that promised word wasn't just a word it wasn't so mary could write a book about it amen and write down what the messenger had told her amen and go around and keep saying the messenger said this the messenger said this the messenger said that's not why it came the word came to her but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest amen the word of promises come to the bride in this day not amen through an announcement of an angel so that we can make a book and so we could write the book and mary could go around with a book say look what the angel said look what the angel said look what the angel said that's not why the angel brought a message amen the word that came to mary was he himself to be made manifest and how was he himself to be made manifest the only way was to come into the virgin bride what do you think's taking place today friends amen it's not just so he can have a book it's so that he himself can be made manifest the word of promise came to the virgin mary but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin what did the virgin do nothing she surrendered she just accepted she just yielded herself she allowed him to have preeminence in her body that's all she did he did it himself he acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because because because she accepted his word to her what are you going to have to do to make all this come to pass just accept his word just believe it just say i surrender all just say i give you my life i believe it i believe it and here i am there's nothing else you can do he himself will manifest himself he himself will bring his word to pass he's the one who lined up the stars he's the one who sent the messenger he's the one who brought you on earth in this day he's done it all there's nothing for you to do except accept what he said believe it and say here i am be it unto me according to your word not according to my will not according to my idea but be it unto me according to your word let's go to luke luke chapter one after this event takes place mary takes off and goes looking for elizabeth her cousin we come to verse 39 luke chapter 1 verse 39 and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into the city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost look at the ministry of the virgin now within her is the seed of life it's it it's alive in her image she's conceived and she runs and she greets elizabeth and all she does is bring a salutation and she brings a salutation brother branham said the baby within elizabeth's womb was dead had never moved before but when she heard the salutation the baby leaped for joy and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and began to prophesy what did mary do she just showed up there's a power working in her life there's an anointing that's upon her and it's bringing life to a baby that would be stillborn it's bringing an anointing on elizabeth things are moving why all she did was accept the word hallelujah elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spoke out in a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this when says this to me that the mother of my lord shall come to me or lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believeth blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord see even elizabeth recognizes she says blessed is she that believed there was nothing else that she could do but believe believe the angel's message believe the true report all she could do believe it and when she believed it she said for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord how am i going to live this kind of life how are we going to do these things just believe it and if you believe it there will be a performance of those things that were told you of the lord how am i going to have the power of the spoken word how am i going to do this and that i don't know how you're going to do it just believe it and it'll be performed just believe it and it'll come to pass just accept it and it'll happen brother bram said and from that time 1961 mary the little virgin never had a woman bore a child without being intercourse with man never had she been able to ever be able to have a child without natural pollen but she believed god and before she felt any life or any or anything else the angel's words was good enough for her she met the lord said hail mary blessed out there among women you're going to have a child knowing no man she said behold the handmaid of the lord and from that time mary never waited till she was positive hallelujah mary didn't wait for a sign mary didn't wait amen until she saw miraculous healings to believe that she was the bride mary didn't wait to believe this word was true until she got a bunch of signs and a positive confirmation she didn't wait till she began to show she didn't wait till she felt something kick inside of her before there was one evidence before anything in her physical body changed she confessed amen what the angel had told her and she believed it amen and it was taking place in her life there's so many things that are happening now amen and so many things that we believe and we know there's things that are going to happen yet and how is it going to happen well when i start to see it tighten up i'll believe you'll never believe then when i start to see the power of the spoken word in the bride you're not going to believe then amen but the real believer believes now the real believer believes before he sees one sign one thing changed one positive confirmation amen of what he holds in his heart just because the angel said it is enough for me [Applause] why she's the ordained one to receive it amen she's the only one on earth to receive it she doesn't have to work her way up to it she doesn't have to try hard she's ordained to believe without seeing the bride the real true bride is not the one that's holding on and hanging around with the believers waiting to see what things happen and when i start to see even nobody's saying this out loud but they're thinking it in their mind it's something in their heart there's a doubt you know we'll start to see and there's going to be a tightening up yeah there's going to be a tightening up and when we see the government start passing yeah governments start passing laws and then we'll see a manifestation the full power of jesus christ on display when we begin to see that that's not the believers the believer says if i don't see it for 30 more years if i don't see it for 40 more years i believe it anyhow because the angel of the lord told me and he showed me out of the scriptures and i believe it hallelujah hallelujah praise be to god there's an interesting story that takes place in judges i believe chapter six i'm not going to take the time to go there we might minister on some other time but but there's a man named gideon remember now five is the number of grace now there's a man named gideon who's going to be the fifth judge of israel and and they're in a time when the midianites now are oppressing them and the midianites and the malachites are taking all they have and he finds himself threshing out wheat and hiding it by the wine press to keep it from the midianites amen every time they would have a harvest and every time they would they would harvest the seed they would rush in and they would steal what they had and leave them just enough to survive to create more crops and so now he's in this situation where he's hiding out he's stretching out wheat just to have enough to hide away from the midianites there's no thought in his mind of defeating the midian knights he's hiding his wheat from the midian knight he's confident they're coming to take it you see where gideon's at he's not he's not saying i'm not hiding it i'm bold as a lion they're not going to take my wheat no he's sure they're going to take his wheat he's confident they're coming again he's confident they're going to have more power than him so he's got to hide it then an angel comes to him says thou gideon mighty man of valor you know we know gideon you know i don't suppose he looked over his shoulder because he was hiding he was probably doing this secretly but the angel says gideon thou mighty men of valor and all of a sudden gideon's like excuse me what did you say he doesn't feel like a mighty man of valor here's a man who's oppressed by enemies who's hiding enough wheat to survive for the next year because they're going to come and take it from him because he's not strong enough to defend himself how gideon mighty man of valor excuse me could you run that past me one more time he says you're going to deliver you're going to deliver israel of the midianites this is the man hiding his wheat you're going to be the one deliver them if gideon thought that he was a deliverer he wouldn't be hiding his weeds gideon thought he couldn't do it he wasn't powerful enough he wasn't able and he responds he says me but my family is the least in israel and my father's house is the least in that tribe we're the lowest so gideon has a perception of himself based off his vision and his carnal understanding based off his natural life his natural heritage his natural birth his position he's looking around and he's identifying himself by his natural position but this angel of the lord has given him a different identification you're not leasing the tribes you're not least in your father's house your father's not least in manasseh he says you're a mighty man of value you're the deliverer you're going to be the judge and you're going to deliver the hand them out of the hand of the midianites and and brother branham has this statement he says and have not i sent thee 1962 he says now gideon when he was out there threshing his wheat no doubt but that a prophet's message was going through his heart that the prophet said i'm the god of abraham isaac jacob i'm the one that brought you out of egypt i'm the one that gave you what you you've got turn to me there he and his father out there threshing his wheat an angel came to him or he thought it was an angel it happened to turn out to be it wasn't an angel it was god himself because it's capital l-o-r-d you see and when he spoke to gideon gideon was a little surprised he said now mighty man of valor listen he didn't know he was he didn't know he was and brother ben says maybe you don't know you are you might be many of those mighty men of valor tonight sitting here you say the little church small group oh my there was only two there him and his daddy there only has to be two here you and christ that's all it takes to be a mighty man of valor that's right he says and from that time 1960 listen we could all take a lesson from mary she never waited till she felt life she never waited for anything positive his word was enough for her she started on her way rejoicing saying testifying she was going to have the baby before any visible sign appeared that's the way a real believer takes god at his word and starts testifying giving god praise as soon as you can settle on the fact that god said so that's what makes the difference god said so gideon looked at his conditions god wasn't looking at his conditions there was there was a position for gideon to step into that was ordained before the foundation of the world it didn't matter what his natural conditions were it didn't matter what look what he looked at amen all that mattered what was what in the what was in the mind of god from before the foundation of the world and when the lord came in the form of an angel and said gideon thou mighty man of valor but everybody said he didn't know that he was but he still was how long had he been a mighty man of valor he was always a mighty man of valor before he was born he was a mighty man of valor before he came to this earth he was the one to deliver them of the hand of the midianites it was his ordained position but he was he had spiritual amnesia he was walking in an identity crisis because he knew who his granddaddy was he knew his daddy was he knew his tribe he knew where he grew up he knew his portion of the land but he didn't yet know anything about who he really was we've come to this life you can recite your genealogy you may know when your ancestors crossed the atlantic to set up as immigrants in the united states you may know where all they lived and how they moved you may have the family bible with who married who and who moved here who was born when and you still don't know nothing about yourself until the angel of the lord the messenger of this age begins to identify who you are and then you're starting to catch a real identity and something inside says be it unto me according to your word that's who i really am you're not weak you're not crippled you're not unpowerful you're not unable you're none of those things you're the bride of jesus christ that's the true identification brother branham comes to the first seal in 1963. he's preaching the first seal he says now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand he's talking about the symbols amen and the vision when when when christ peeled back the seal and a white horse rider went out and the pale horse is given in a church symbol do you understand it church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken so the actual seal is broken in the last days yes broken to who not to christ but to the church notice now oh my that just makes me tremble stop for a minute what's making the prophet tremble he says that was the symbol form they for thousands of years saw the white horse rider and a crown was given and had a bow and they knew all of that but when it's actually time to be broken broken to who not to christ he already knows so when it comes time to break who's he going to break it to he's going to break it to the church he's going to break it to the bride and brother branham is here watching the breaking of the seal and he's looking at the people that it's broken to and he says that makes me tremble this wasn't a series that he preached friends amen this wasn't an idea that he had that he could take a series of ten sermons on that was a pretty good idea this was changing everything and he comes along and he says broke into who to the church oh that just makes me tremble i hope that the church truly understands it see what i mean you people i'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it so what's he doing he's here at the time that christ has come in the actual breaking of the seal to identify what the symbols are amen in the only way that it can be broken amen is if the seventh church age messenger is here and that the bride is sitting presents so in order for them to understand what's happening he says i'm going to call you bride so that you understand it you could be sitting there that day and you could be listening to the prophet and you could take the term bride as a generic term you're sitting there oh okay bride he's talking to that one and that one and that one he's talking to all these people but there's a different revelation when you sit there and he says i'm going to call you bride and you don't take it in a group setting you don't take it in a building you don't take it and people sitting in the building but when he says i'm going to call you bride something in your heart lightens like that and says he's talking about me me personally me me not the group me see that revelation changes everything the angel of the lord has come the angel standing in the pulpit and the angel the lord himself is breaking the seals through this angel and he's coming down and is the actual breaking of the seal it is the time it is the event it's taking place right then and he looks out and he says now i'm going to give you a positive identification so that it's not going to go over your head so that you won't miss what's taking place i'm going to call you bride oh hallelujah there's not another term that i want to hear there's not another thing that you can say to me that gets me more excited in this day when he says i'm going to call you bride and i can say be it unto me according to your word you're talking about me that prophet's calling me out he's identifying me how do i know because the seals were broke to me it's not broke to christ amen it's not broke amen to christ it's broke to the church to the bride and if i saw the breaking of those seals and i can see what the thunders are and i believe what it is then that makes me bride now mighty man of elder he didn't know that he was but he still was and when you see the breaking of the seals and you know by revelation what's going on amen it's identifying you as bride what else do you need to see what other manifestation do you have to have it's the revelation of the seals in your life that identifies you as the bride hallelujah see an angel came to gideon and gave him his identification and he had to believe what the angel said angel came to mary and gave her identification and she had to believe what the angel said but an angel has come to you to give you an identification and you have to believe what he said some of us have sat too long on our hands waiting for something to happen to identify me as the bride i'll know when i have a tingly sensation i'll know when this happens and i'll know when i see a vision i'll know when something else i'll know when god himself comes down into god himself has already come down and told you through the mouth of that prophet that was god speaking and breaking his seals to his bride what more are we looking for that was the event that is the identification it's already happened and now there's a people on this earth that's looking at that and saying i'm not waiting for another sign i'm not waiting something in my heart says that ain't nothing but the truth and if that's the truth and if i see it that's my identification i'm the bride what else do you need to be identified the brother you don't need anything else the devil has us sitting on our heels saying someday if i get a sign if i see something if i have a sensation next altar call next camp meeting forget all of that go back to the identification that the prophet gave in the breaking of the seal who's he breaking it to he's breaking it to the bride well i see the seals and i see the thunders and i believe in malachi 4 and i believe in the coming of the lord i believe in all of that but i'm just waiting to know if i'm in the bride or not the devil has got you duped [Applause] the devil has got you sitting on your heels waiting for some day there is no some day the day is here the day is now it's time to quit questioning how will this be will there be a man will there be a prayer line will there be a meeting i know it's true but how will it be he's already identified you by breaking his seals to you by unveiling himself christ doesn't unveil himself to the foolish virgin he doesn't unveil himself to the harlots he unveils himself to his bride and i've seen the unveiling of god and something in my heart has a positive witness that that's nothing but the truth you can't say that's the truth the seals are open brother branham was malachi 4. revelations 10 7 it's all happened the mighty angels come down i believe it all oh if i was only in the bride that's a lie of the devil that's deception from your enemy trying to keep you from your promised land when brother banham says you're the bride you can't say i know he is and she is he is and she is it doesn't help you to be able to identify others as bride there's no victory in that revelation there's no victory in the revelation well i know my husband i know my wife is i know my mother is i know this one is i know that one there's no victory in that revelation but victory comes in the revelation is when he said i'm going to call you bride you say that prophet called me bride that's overcoming revelation that's grace being extended to you that's you coming in contact with the love of god and saying that's my position from before the foundation of the world what are those five stars aligned to announce i'm coming it announced my approach it announced me being here today that's what those five stars announced it announced me being on earth right now receiving the word and i hope you can say the same thing about you that in 1962 when there was an alignment of five stars announcing the approach an infant bride amen it was talking about me those stars were pointing to me not to my friend not to those that go to church with me to me if every one of them fall away those five stars were still pointing to me a positive identification from an angel oh if i could have been there that day to hear him he's here he's speaking if i could have an angel what about the angel messenger in the pulpit this morning what about the preacher that's here this morning with the gift of god giving you a positive identification is there something in you can say that's me he's talking about me what he's saying is me that's who i really am [Music] [Applause] what are you what should you wait for take it now take it this morning take it by faith say be it unto me according to your word there's an angel in the pulpit now identifying a bride by the revelation of the word [Applause] what more do we need a sign what more signs do we need how how will it be me how will it happen it's the holy ghost overshadowing you and that thing that's going to be born in you is christ i don't comprehend in my mind it's not doesn't make logical sense to me but i can say from my heart be it unto me according to your word [Applause] brother brenda comes in the invisible union of the bride of christ he says he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgiveness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the bible said your first husband that you were married to the word the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church no that don't sound right does it you might find that in the almanac but not in god's bible by the washing of the water by the word in the word see what word luther's word nope it's included it's included but not that alone wesley's word nope it's included in this but not wesley's alone if you're going to be washed in the water of the word you've got to be washed in the water of the word for your day and that washing of the water of the word cleanses us from all sin listen the prophet goes on washed by the water of the word you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a minute you're standing now listen to the qualifications you are standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every jot every title where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from those shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah boy i want that how do i get that by believing every word every jot every tittle every amen by believing the fully restored word in this day makes you washed in the water of the word for this age it makes you justified as if you never did it in the first place who told you that an angel from the lord the seventh church aged messenger the angel of the lord is the one who said that amen the same kind of angel who spoke to mary same kind of angel amen who spoke to gideon if they can believe that angel why can't you believe this angel what's different there's nothing different it's an angel from the lord speaking to you telling you that you have never done it in the first place but i'm so condemned about my past listen to the angel but i've done so many wrong things so at rahab so had mary magdalene hallelujah that didn't stop them from being part of god's plan he says talk about a thanksgiving oh i feel good real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know of you are now listen this is not just somebody talking this is the angel to the age amen this is the angel this is the last angel the seventh church age messenger amen this is the angel of revelation 10 7. this is the this is the fulfillment of scripture speaking these words and he says you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god you say how me you know what i've done he's not referencing what you've done these five these five planets aligning showed grace is coming what is grace grace is the effect of god's love in your life when did you get that love before the foundation of the world it bypasses your merit it bypasses your conduct and goes right back to your original position you never did it in the first place what's your first place in the mind of god you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god how are you going to believe unless you've heard it how are you gonna believe every word of god unless you come to the full restoration of the word amen have you come to the full restoration of the word have you heard it do you believe it you're eligible for this position that makes this statement pointed to you not don't say that's to the bribe that's too generic don't say that's through the church that's too generic don't say this to this church that's too generic he is speaking to you as an individual this is your individual position in christ if you've been born of the spirit washing the blood of the lamb and believe every word of god you stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect [Music] well i just can't accept that i'm sorry i can i can not by my merit but by grace not by what i've done by what the five five alignment of planets has announced coming on the earth i can say it because an angel said it i can believe it because he told me i can believe it because there's a witness in my heart i believe that that's true for me i'm perfect not because of merit not because of deeds not because of my current conduct i'm perfect because i've been washed in the water of the bleeding word what word the full word which is jesus christ restored in this day we're feasting on that word we're covered in that blood we're washed by the washing of the water of the world no more denominational water that's already got filth inside of it you can't get purified by denominational water you can only be washed pure virtuous sinless as though you never sin in the first place the only word that can wash is the fully restored worse with no mind of man no man's interpretation no hybridization [Applause] and if you believe you've come to that and that you believe it despite yourself then the angel is talking to you not your neighbor not the church not the church back 50 years ago the angel is speaking to you can you receive it like gideon can you receive it like mary can you say be it unto me according to your word not my deeds according to your word you see friends the things that the prophet has told us that this bride has potential for is not possible if she's condemned the things that the lord has said that would be manifest through this bride in the end time is not possible if there's a speck of condemnation how can i speak something into existence i just yelled at my children there has to be something more powerful than my conduct there has to be something that has a more of a sanctifying power than my willpower there's if i'm going to come to perfection it's going to have to be something outside of me outside of my human my humanness outside of my human abilities because i will never come to this position in myself i've come to this position because he said so and then he made it possible by opening the word and guess what you can say the seals were broke in 1963. that's true but the seals were broke to me and if the seals were broke to me then i'm the bride and if i've been born in the spirit and washing the blood of jesus christ and believe every word of god i stand as though i've never sinned in the first place now when god unctious you speak yes because you're as righteous as god is righteous you're as pure as christ is pure because of what he's done let's look at luke chapter one and verse 46. this is mary's response luke 1 46 and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord why she believed it before there was one trace of life she believed it for one thing before one thing in her physical form changed she believed it and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord my spirit hath rejoiced in the god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest state of his hand made for for behold for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for us it's a little backwards all the previous generations been looking forward to this one calling this one blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he has showed strength with his arm he has scattered the proud and the imagination of their hearts he has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he has filled the hungry with good things in the rich he has sent empty away he hath hope and his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to a seed forever what is this the cry of the virgin bride my soul does magnify the lord my spirit cries out in his mercy he has taken the nothings of the world and confounded the wisdom of the wise he has brought down the rich and he has fed the hungry amen god did this she couldn't do it we can't do it he's done it [Music] and we believe it praise be unto god don't sit another day saying god could you just show me he's showing you in the breaking of the seals he's showing you in the revealing of the word he doesn't reveal his word to everybody he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't give the mystery of the seven unknown thunders to everyone he gives it to his bride i have no problem with the seals i have no problem with the thunders i have no problem with what's going to take place in the future i have no problem with the bride i just don't know if i meant every identification you need you're walking on top of ignoring the true signs looking for a false sign when i have a shaking sensation when i have a dynamic outpouring of spirit when i have a supernatural certain experience take place in my life then i'll know you're looking for false evidence and passing up the true evidence that's right in front of you what is the true evidence the messenger from heaven has i told you who you are he's broke the seals he's broke the word the mighty god's been unveiled and you see it and you believe it [Applause] oh god if you could just show me he's showing you every service he's showing you every tape he's showing you every message book you read he's showing you you're the one i'm willing you're the one i love you're the one i'm breaking my mysteries to you're my sweetheart you're the one would you just receive it hallelujah just receive it say god i believe it with all of my heart i'm not worthy i'm not capable i'm the lowest of the law i'm nobody of the littlest family of the littlest group a late comer whatever it is i've sinned many a sin i've lived a horrible life it doesn't matter all i'm saying lord is what you've said through your messenger i believe to be true when you broke those seals i believed every word of it amen when you magnified your word i believed it when you unveiled yourself i believed it well you said i believe i have no problem with the message i have no problem with the messenger i have no problem then i'd like to make a statement if you have no problem with the message no problem with the messenger no problem with the seals no problem with the revelations then you have no problem millions have heard this word and don't believe it millions have heard a tape or read a book or had a friend witness to him it may be billion by now i don't know how many and they couldn't receive it thousands and tens of thousands were raised in churches where the message was preached and they left but you couldn't millions heard a tape and didn't believe it you did tens of thousands and thousands of thousands amen have heard the seals and still wonder if the seals are open but you know they're open [Music] if you don't have a problem with the word you don't have a problem quit letting the devil give you a problem but i don't live in overcoming life because you don't believe you're the bride but i should live a different kind of life when when you believe and identify yourself in the word and believe what he said about you you'll live an overcoming life your doubt is being expressed in your conduct amen but i just keep following us in and i just keep making the same mistakes it's because you're still wondering if you're the bride or not if we just accept what he said and receive it the way he said it and take what brother branham said and said that's me he's talking about and you believe it with all your heart and surrender yourself to guess what's going to happen your life is going to change things you struggle with will start falling away not through effort but the manifestation of your revelation pushes away unbelief all sin is a product of unbelief when i stop sinning i know i got it you'll never stop sinning when i overcome this you'll never overcome it unless you respond to the faith that's in your heart and receive what he's given you and believe it with all your heart that will change your life the devil's got us on merry-go-rounds keep circling someday i'll overcome this and when i overcome that the secret to overcoming is believing faith this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith if you have no problem with the message you have no problem just accept it as such just believe it next time you hear a tape and brother bam says you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ say amen not amen to who he's talking to on the tape not amen to who the preacher is preaching but amen to me that's nothing but the truth and i believe it and you keep confessing it and you keep walking it and you keep believing it and watch what happens to your life those things just begin to fade away i'm tired of the devil lying to god's children i'm tired of the deception god's children living below their privileges why it's because of what we believe but if we'll just walk into the faith that's there and just surrender to it and just give him preeminence not try to figure anything out not try to figure out how it's going to be how is this going to happen how's it going to be it doesn't matter the holy ghost will overshadow you you just say be it unto me according to that word that you just spoke what word sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ you never did it in the beginning be it unto me be it unto me according to your word one word the word that the angel just said i believe it now be it unto me the burden of proof is not on you i've got to prove i'm a bride no you don't the burden of proof is not on you the burden of proof is on the one who called you the bride the one who identified you is the one who has to prove what he's identified well i just have to prove there's got to be a healing there's got to be a manifestation there's got to be a perfect life amen you're going to get really tired really fast the burden of proof is not yours the burden of proof is the one who said you're the bride lord you said it i accept it and receive it now bring it to pass in my life isn't that simpler that's freedom every other thought is bondage that is total liberty and freedom in christ it's not a life you live it's a life he lives through you but he can only do what you believe he's there he's there in capernaum he's there in nazareth he's there to heal everybody but he couldn't do many money miracles because of their unbelief he was there to heal the multitudes he would go into one place they would believe and everybody in the city would be healed he would go to his own hometown and they would have doubts and only a few were healed see there's a there's a law that his word operates by faith so just release faith quit holding it back quit waiting quit looking for another time just release the faith that's in your heart and say lord i believe your word i believe you've opened the seals i believe you've come down as the mighty angel i believe revelation 10 1-7 has happened i believe it i believe i'm the bride i believe it i don't understand it but i believe it and i'm just gonna confess it i'm just gonna tell others about it i'm gonna say i'm the bride why because your angel said i was who's he breaking it to to the church to the bride what's broken to me i must be the bride don't overthink it just receive it [Music] and when you receive it confess it when you confess it walk in it and watch what happens next god bless you let's all stand amen friends bennett made a statement he said when the bride can discern the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and resist and withstand the antichrist spirit amen the devil will be powerless before her right now i don't want to explain that i just want to talk about this powerless devil what makes the devil powerful and what makes him powerless see there's only one power that he has really he says well he has cancer and he has the car wrecks and no he really only has one power and that power is deception it's the only power he has is the power of deception and when a true revelation comes it dispels the deception and he he is powerless before her by what by the full revelation of the full word he is rendered powerless so don't let him deceive you about your identification because when you can receive who you really are and believe it by faith and confess it and act on it before you see one thing change but if you truly can believe it and truly confess it and stand on it he becomes powerless to hinder you from being the bride so what's he using deception lies don't believe him anymore say i refuse to believe the devil and i accept the angel messenger hallelujah well someday if he writes it in the skies he already circled a cloud what more do you need what other sign do we need to just surrender and say it's me it's me i'm the bride i know it why because i believe not my conduct not my genealogy not my years of service in the message none of that matters what matters is that i believe it and i know it and it's true and i'm willing to stand on it by revelation are you the bride absolutely how do you know because he broke the seals to me because a messenger identified me as a bride i believe it but what signs you have in your life and what happened when you got the holy ghost where is your he never told me to look for that he told me to believe and to receive and that i would have an experience of the new birth and that experience is a changed life stop looking for supernatural signs we've got gobs of them tons of them look for the opening of the word look for it being revealed to his bride and if he's revealing his word to you if your heart is burning on fire under the preaching of the word what's happening whose heart's burning well it's the bridegroom speaking to his bride a thousand other girls may not care what he says but there's one girl whose heart burns whenever the bridegroom speaks [Applause] i just get so excited when i listen to a message when i read the books i just something in me keeps stirring what is that friends that's your identification that's who you really are amen stop stop looking for something else and just say i surrender take me let's bow our heads their heavenly father we thank you lord jesus you are so amazing lord what you've done in our age is beyond a mental conception our comprehension it goes so much deeper than that it goes down into our soul and it ignites a fire that's more than emotion that's more than intellect it's more than reasoning it's a reality burning within us lord we just ask now that you would just help us to resist all the lies of the enemy god if your children are sitting here you're a little bride and lord she's not yet been able to step into that pure identification given by your messenger because of a doubt because of a concern because of a question i pray god that they would be able to push all those things aside and say be it unto me according to your word you call me bride and i believe it lord let that manifestation come forth let that reality come to the hearts of your believing children and lord let a manifestation come from that statement of faith and let there be a life lived lord by your power in her we love you god we ask your blessings to be upon us anoint each one lord move on the hearts of the people god we want the devil to be powerless because he has no more deception you've given the word lord you've given the vindication of the word the devil should be powerless to us now forgive us lord for not walking in it forgive us we're not surrendering into it more but help us now as we make a full surrender lord as we give ourselves afresh to you lord every one of us we want to say be it unto me according to your word oh god we're surrendering lord every thought and every imagination and every carnal idea and we just want that word to be fleshed out in these bodies we surrender to it we believe it we accept it and we know it's nothing but the truth let it come to manifestation now in us lord not another time now not another place here not another people but us as individuals let it come now lord let the reality move into manifestation in a greater way than ever before we ask it in the name of jesus christ we love you lord take your people lord as we go out to these doors and go into the world lord let us be bright shining lights burning embers moving with confidence in who we are who you are in us let us not hold back from the world anymore and withhold this light lord but let us set it on a candlestick lord and let the whole world see that this is nothing but the truth lord we're not going to apologize anymore for being your bride we're not going to him haul around and act like it's not us we know lord individually you've identified us with your bride we're not ashamed of that lord but we're happy to be considered your bride let us put that light on a candlestick for all the world to see may many others find their way to you lord to that same revelation take us from our place here as we go out for fellowship as we go out into our homes let us meditate on these things let them not fade away but let eternal things be taking place now lord let deception be removed from your people we ask it in jesus christ's name amen brother venom said we could all take a lesson from mary before she felt one thing [Music] before she had one positive sign of life she testified we could all take a lesson from mary before there's one sign before one supernatural event takes place i believe i'm the bride the supernatural event has already taken place he's given you eyes to see that's the most supernatural event of them all there are people who are blind to the message of the hour that have been given the power to open blinded eyes there have been people who are blind to the message of the hour have been given the power to raise the dead so what's the greatest sign not raising the dead not opening blinded eyes not healing the sick what's the greatest sign the greatest sign is having isaf it makes your eyes come open and you see the message for your day that's the greatest sign friends you can be blind and speak in tongues and dance in the spirit and raise the dead but only the bride gets the isaf and only the bride has eyes to see what other sign do you want what other manifestation are you looking for the greatest one that you could ever get you've already got you have eyes to see if he does nothing else the rest of your life you should sing and rejoice like mary my my soul does magnify the lord for he's given me eyes to see and i know that i'm the bride god bless you let's sing this song be it unto me if you help me with the song you can be dismissed as we sing you can stay in worship as you like just want to say we love you and god bless you be careful out there supposed to start snowing be careful on your way home and god be with you let's sing this song together according to your promises [Music] i can stand secure lord carve upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word o lord [Music] according to your word to your promises i can stand secure lord carve upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word [Music] according to your work to your promises i can stand secured upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your [Music] to word
