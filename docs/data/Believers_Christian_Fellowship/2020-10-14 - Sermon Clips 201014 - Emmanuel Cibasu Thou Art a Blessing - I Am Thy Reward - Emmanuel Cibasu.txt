TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do you remember he put adam on a covenant do this and not this this and not that touch not handle not taste not but we find out when he started again he started with abraham and in abraham he started him on an unconditional covenant the first man adam was given a law to live by do not touch that touch not but the second man god is rebuilding he's storing him on an unconditional covenant not if you will i have already done it i've blessed you and you you and your seed and so forth after you it was an unconditional covenant that he started with abraham and the reason he starting with abraham giving him an unconditional covenant is because god found that man cannot keep a covenant you and i we cannot keep a covenant he takes god himself to keep his own covenant and when he called abraham just think about abraham like you and me maybe maybe a farmer a hunter when he called him what he expected and wanted from abram was for abraham only to believe and he gave him that opportunity that that that ability to believe him because he was not going to force him and by simply believing what he called him he called him for the rest was upon god he was determined as we believe his word the remaining of what he will do with this bride that's god's determination he will accomplish it without your input and my input
