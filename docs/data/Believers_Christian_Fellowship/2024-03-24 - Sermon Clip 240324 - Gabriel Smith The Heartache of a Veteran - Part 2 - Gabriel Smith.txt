========================================

we we we all uh want to uh do a little tweak here and we know uh because we like it our way is that right but but God has called us to take what has been corrupted and to have a true restoration that it goes back to the original amen right we don't want to add that one thing to it we we don't even want to put the fuzzy dice on the mirror right we want it original amen just like it came from the factory and and you know we we we we think of this and and in this message there there's so many uh offshoots and so many uh ideas and and and there's so many different fandangled things but I I love what the prophet said uh in a a man running from the presence of the Lord he he he took the Mysteries and he made it so real brother bam says he says in uh man running from the presence of the Lord he says now watch what he says may all the great Mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age Lord be unveiled to us amen and will see the plainness of God Amen so so the revelations ought to make what Christ plain to us so so if we have a revel ation of complication that's not the Mysteries but but the revelations are to bring plainness of Christ but but watch what he says he says so that we'll know what's the mystery supposed to do right so that we'll know how to behave ourselves sir and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the Lord Jesus so in this message in this seven seal book of redemption that's been Loos to us in this day yes it ought to bring plainness and it ought to bring us to a realization of the incorrect parts of our body and it ought to bring our members of our body into discipline to God's word amen and and if that message brings anything else we're looking at it wrong you know we we all want the Mysteries but but really in essence we ought to look and say what are the Mysteries doing for me where am I at in my Christian experience and and and and if it's in a and and if we're falling short then then maybe we need to real maybe we need to take a second look and go wait a minute minute maybe I don't see the Mysteries like I should
