========================================

we've learned these things since we're little toddlers we've learned these things since we're little kids those who have been raised in church and we know the story we've seen the picture books we've colored pictures about it amen but I don't think we realize the gravity of the situation he's standing there with no hope in the world nothing that he himself can ever do to ever cover his shame and nakedness he's lost he's finished he's done and there's nothing he can do himself right and here comes God Amen coming down in judgment and God is now ad ministering judgment and he's standing here naked exposed helpless with irreversible damage and there's nothing he can do but he's got a loving father who created him and has a purpose for his life and that father goes and finds an innocent lamb that's never sinned never disbelieved never done anything wrong and he took that lamb and he slayed that lamb can you imagine what Adam was thinking when he was watching God there had never been death there had never been Bloodshed there had never been the bleeding of the Lamb there never been the stench of fresh flowing blood this was death yes this was I guarantee a traumatic event first time he had ever witnessed it first time he had ever seen death first time he had ever witnessed suffering the first time he'd ever seen blood flow the first time he had heard a desperate bleed the first time he had heard a death rattle and it was God doing it it was God afflicting the punishment it was God causing the death what was he doing it for because he had to have a covering of innocency to cover the shame of his son sir something had to die because that was the penalty for sin so God took this innocent lamb and this innocent lamb became Adam by imputation and he imputed Adam's sin upon this lamb and slayed slayed the lamb not for the lamb but he slayed the lamb for Adam's sins and then he took the skin off of the lamb and he placed it upon his son and now his son was covered and could continue on amen he wasn't smitten dead in an instant he continued on and God was trying he was beginning the process of restoring fellowship with his Fallen son what a what an experience that would have been to live through it's not a coloring book page it was a reality but neither is Jesus Christ nailed to the cross a coloring book page it's a reality amen who was nailed to the cross that's me he wasn't there for him he was there for me he was nailed because of my sin because of my nakedness because I left the world word because I left the veil of innocency not just I was born wrong I chose to do wrong amen and he took all of my sin and all of my shame and all of my perversion and all of my red spots and he shed his blood and he died and he was the innocent lamb so that God could clothe me in a white robe
