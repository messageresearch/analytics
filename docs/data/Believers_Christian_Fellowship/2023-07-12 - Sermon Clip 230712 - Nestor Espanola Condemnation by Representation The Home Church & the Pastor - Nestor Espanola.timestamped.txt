[0:00] that's why the prophet said
[0:02] those who love you
[0:04] those you love
[0:07] God will give it to you
[0:10] see
[0:12] that's how important the pastor is
[0:15] praise God he is God's angels to you
[0:20] praise God to guide you
[0:22] he will be accountable
[0:25] to your soul
[0:27] see that's why I'm very careful even in
[0:30] our church I'm very careful when I
[0:33] studied the message when I started
[0:35] scripture before I give it to the people
[0:37] praise God see
[0:40] because that is the the last
[0:44] commandments of Jesus to the apostles if
[0:47] you love me
[0:50] feed my lamb
[0:52] Peter if you love me feed my sheep be
[0:55] there if you love me feed my sheep
[0:58] say if you love the Lord if the minister
[1:02] is a pastor love the Lord he will find
[1:05] he will find the food
[1:08] for God's children for the ship of God
[1:10] for the Lamb of God
[1:13] Hallelujah
[1:15] see
[1:17] that's why the message you cannot feed
[1:19] the flux in a wishy washy message you
[1:22] know
[1:23] praise God you cannot do that to the
[1:26] message believer
[1:28] say in the church that's why I've been
[1:30] telling you to the people read the
[1:32] message read the message in that way you
[1:35] will understand what I am saying
[1:37] I give you the quotation but if you
[1:40] don't read the message you don't know
[1:42] praise God the holy story
[1:46] Hallelujah
[1:49] say even if you read the message if you
[1:51] have no Pastor you will be like the
[1:54] eunuch
[1:55] remember that in the book of Acts
[1:58] then there is one unlearned man
[2:02] Phillips
[2:04] he said how how do I know if nobody
[2:06] explained it
[2:09] but he is a smart man
[2:12] Hallelujah that is what I'm telling to
[2:15] the people
[2:17] you need Pastor praise God you need home
[2:21] Church
[2:22] say
[2:23] Hallelujah
[2:25] when you are at home
[2:27] say yorat is you know it
[2:31] then here at home you're going to
[2:34] exercise
[2:35] everything Faith virtue
[2:39] your Temperance your patience
[2:42] praise God your godliness
[2:45] you can only
[2:47] do it here not in the outside
[2:50] Alleluia
