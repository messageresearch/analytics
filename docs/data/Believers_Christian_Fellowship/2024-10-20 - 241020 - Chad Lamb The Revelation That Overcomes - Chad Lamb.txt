and may they become one with us and may we move into that image we love you God and we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you all good morning it's good to be here with youen if you could take your Bibles and turn to the Book of Romans say God bless you brother Jim it was certainly good to hear you sing again brother we appreciate that I said when I see him standing singing I thank God that he's healed our brother and continuing to heal our brother amen God is so good amen let's look at Romans chapter 16 together we're going to look at uh read a couple verses while we're standing yet Romans 16 let's begin with verse 25 Romans 16:25 now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever amen amen amen God bless you as you have your seats praise be to God we look back uh here at verse 25 it says now to him that is of power to establish you this word establish you is is a word that I want to look at for just a moment if we pull it up uh in the concordance it's it's translated established established strengthened steadfastly set that's how it's translated into the King James Bible it means to make stable Amen to place firmly to set fast to fix to set one's face steadfastly amen to strengthen to make firm to render constant amen amen I don't know about you but I like that amen the whole list sounds good to me that's what I want and he and he says he says now him that is of power to establish you so God has the power to establish you but how according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ and according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began so what is this preaching of Paul revealing the mystery of Jesus Christ what does it do it's what God is using to establish the church and so what what is God what is God doing with the gospel the preaching of Christ the revelation of the mystery what is he doing he's he's making stable his church he's placing it firm he's setting it fast amen he's he's he's setting one's face steadfastly he's making firm he's rendering it constant amen how's he doing it by the revelation of the word being preached amen and so and so we realize that God does not change his ways amen he's still doing the same thing he's still revealing the mystery of Jesus Christ in our day there's still a mystery that has been kept secret in the back part of God's mind but has been revealed amen through another messenger amen and he come back to restore to us all that was lost and to Break Forth that great mystery that was in the back part of God's mind and what is God doing God is establishing us according to the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Mystery that's been hid since the foundation of the world and so it's this gospel it's this Revelation it it's this preaching that brought forth amen it's what God is using to set us fast to establish us to make us firm to render us constant amen so so that is to me that is just absolutely amazing that this is the tool in God's hand because he's got the power to establish us but he's doing it according to the preaching according to the mystery let's turn quickly to Judges chapter 3 also want to say as we're turning that I thoroughly enjoyed the last two Services the service with brother Nathaniel was was wonderful what a good lesson it was and then I also very much uh enjoyed Wednesday night with brother Andreas and so many I felt like I left with a pocket full of gold nuggets and and I've been chewing on it meditating on discussing it ever since then amen and so there's some things that he said that even has just been an inspiration even for today and so I I was just disappointed that he stopped and then disappointed we couldn't add another service the next day and so I talked to him about possibly coming back and doing weekend meetings so he has a chance to express more of his thought and he said he would if the Lord allows so just pray that the door opens hopefully sometime this coming year that we can have our brother back according to the will of the Lord but I certainly enjoyed it amen uh Judges chapter 3 Judges chapter 3:31 I'm going to read one verse judges 3:31 and after him was shamgar the son of anith which slew the Philistines 600 men with an ox go and he also delivered Israel me we've got a little scripture here there's only really two scriptures in the Bible that I'm aware of that mentioned shamgar here is it where it's directly mentioned and it's mentioned also Deborah mentioned shamgar uh and and as she begins to speak in the next chapter but uh but we see there's just a little blip in the Bible about this shamgar uh who slew the Philistine 600 men with an ox go and he also delivered Israel and so we know he became one of the judges of Israel we've got so little information but I thank God that he sent a prophet who could give us more information because God doesn't Place anything in his Bible in vain everything is there for a purpose and it has a meaning and brother Ram taught us that God condenses his truth because the Bible's only so big but the the truth of God is is is unending Everlasting and unfathomable and he's packed the whole revelation of God into the Bible so so many things have to be extracted out of it amen but but in the message convinced and then concerned he says uh he speaks of shamgar he says he was one of the judges of Israel many ministers never even seen that in the Bible but he was one of the judges of Israel one little verse wrote about him but I like him he's a man after my heart now you know the Philistines then every man did what he wanted to do so we find out that the Israelites had raised up a whole lot of crop and the Philistines would set back over there and gambled and let them slay for them and there would there they'd walk right in no Unity among them go right on in and say well take their crops year after year they did that this little old fellow one day he wasn't a Warrior brother REM says he was just a humble farmer he wasn't the Bible doesn't record that he was any any had any special abilities talents Supernatural strengths but he was just a one little fellow he wasn't a warrior only thing he had was his crop and I imagined him standing there after putting his crop in the barn he looked at his little ragged kids and his wife needed a dress and he just got it all laid in nice and he was standing there leaning saying well maybe we can eat this winter one thing I absolutely of love about the ministry of a prophet in our day is he makes the Bible come alive in a way where you can realize these were human beings they had motion and feeling and families and situations and circumstances and if it happened for them it can happen for me amen that we're living amen like the Bible says of Elisha he was a man of like passion such as we are we realize then The Human Experience is The Human Experience and it has been The Human Experience for quite some time so there's nothing different between them and and I me and them it's just the time frame that we're living in but many times the conditions repeat we find ourselves in the in the same situations and we can take strength from what we read what God has done and he's he's now we the situation Comes Alive amen year after year he's farming he's laboring he's working and year after year they come and steal the majority of what he's worked for leaving him just enough to barely sustain he's barely getting by he's barely surviving no thriving and his kids are ragged his wife needs a dress I mean and he's he's got hope that this time it'll be different this time we'll keep our crop amen and this is the this is the situation shamgar finds himself in and he says he he just got it all laid in nice put packed in the barn and he was standing there leaning saying well maybe we can eat this winter he heard something he looked looked out the barn window and here come a thousand Philistines March March March great big plates of armor over them big well-trained men Spears in their hands marching right up to take what he had he looked down at his kids he looked at his wife he was concerned but what was he he was helpless he's not a swordsman now he didn't say now wait a minute maybe I better go to school and learn how to duel the Creeds if he'd had done that that's all he'd have knowed about but there's one thing that he knowed he had happen to think I love when somebody just happens to think you realize we don't ever just happen to think he just happened to think by birth I'm an Israelite and God promised Abraham my father that his seed would possess the gates of his enemy amen that's enough amen he was concerned of his family he was convinced he was an Israelite the first thing he had in his hand he grabbed it he was an ox goat a stick a little piece of brass on the end of it knocked the mud off the plow pushed the and go along go the ox as it went along and a thousand Philistines with armor he he don't see the opposition he was concerned and he was convinced he was convinced and know that he was an Israelite he was convinced that God could couldn't lie he was convinced that the blessing was upon him he knew that it was a promise of God Amen brother I feel religious right now he was convinced that it was God's promise just the same as acts 238 is God's promise he was convinced that God said his seed which he was would possess the Gate of the enemy so he grabbed that Ox goat and stood right out there and beat every one of them down amen listen listen something changed in shamgar but what changed in shamgar was not the strength in his arms what changed in shamgar was not he didn't get extra weapons extra tools extra gifts extra talents none of that changed what changed in samgar is his spiritual Amnesia broke and he caught a revelation of who he was what gave him the strength to resist the Philistines was not a sword was not a spear was not something new amen was actually something old yeah a promise a word of God that he had already made a promise that he had already given that was laying there and it was unchanging it was as unchanging as God was unchanging and what happened is is the situation of Life had beat shamgar and the rest of the Israelites down until they started to forget who they were and they started forget the the what it meant to be a Seed of Abraham and they lost sight of the promise so many negative things had happened so many bad things had happened to them they lost their crops they come under bondage and so many situations begin to Rob them of the revelation of who they were and what it means to be a Seed of Abraham so when it come time for God to bring Deliverance he didn't need he didn't need to send somebody to military training he didn't need to teach him how to forge weapons the the brother B said that he was helpless he was helpless year after after year they had come and robbed him of his crops year after year they had been in bondage and slavery year after year he was helpless to resist them he could do nothing to hold on to his crops he could not do nothing to stop the the Looting and the thievery and he could do nothing to change his condition because when he looked at himself in the flesh there was nothing he could do he was weak yes sir and that remains the reality listen if we look at our flesh we are weak if we look at our talents our abilities our skills our strength our mind everything on the human level is an absolute failure and incapable and weakness of overcoming in the day we live but oh I thank God what changed in shamgar was not anything physical nothing physical changed in shamgar what changed in shamgar was a revelation that came back to him wait a minute wait a minute didn't Moses say didn't God tell us that he's given us this land didn't he tell us that it's ours to possess didn't he tell us we could drive out the enemies didn't he tell us that his Delight would be upon us didn't he tell us that it would bring forth milk and honey didn't he tell us that this promise is to the Seed of Abraham they shall possess the gates of their enemy why am I standing here letting this enemy possess my Gates when there's a promise laying there amen shamgar didn't just think God dropped the Revelation in his heart to connect him back to a promise that had already been made by a prophet of God and shamgar overcame by Revelation shamgar overcame by a revelation not by a new tactic not by a new skill not by a new gift amen he overcame by a revelation and a revelation of what had already been written that's right what I love the Bible I love this message it's life to the children of Goden shamgar didn't have to change one thing about himself to defeat those enemies right he didn't have to go to church he didn't have to offer an additional sacrifice he didn't have to get some Merit from God some he didn't do something to get an extra reward he didn't have to change one thing about himself and he didn't need to do or get anything else all he needed to do was be himself yeah amen and what was shamgar you know you look in the natural shamgar was a farmer shamgar was a nobody he was weak he was he was poor he he had he had been robbed so many times his children were shabby if his children were shabby and his wife needed a dress what did he look like right right what was this estate looking like he had no extra funds to do anything he everything about him was in deterioration he didn't need to get a loan he didn't need to go to school he didn't need to buy weapons he didn't need to go to the church he didn't need to get new gifts he didn't need to change anything about himself what needed to change was his Revelation and it was the only thing that needed to change and when the Revelation changed he took up his Ox go because what was the ox go the ox go was him he was a farmer it was what was in his hand it was who he was it was the it was the position he was in that God had put him in he didn't have to get a new position he could fight like a farmer not like a warrior amen it's so interesting he took the ox goat he took the ox go and went out and slew 600 Philistines with an ox go because the ox go represented his position he didn't have to change position he didn't have to wait till he started preaching he didn't have to wait till he got a position in the church he could go as he was he could go with the Revelation he had and who he was and the position God put him in and with that revelation and he can knock down all the Philistine Army that came to Rob him how foolish a farmer with Rags with an ox goat in his hand standing in the middle of the road beating down 600 Philistines and at the end of the day they're all dead and he's standing there with an ox goat in his hand it's completely unreasonable but this has nothing to do with reason it has everything to do with the revelation of the promise of God for the children of God and that is what God has restored in our day he's broke our spiritual Amnesia to bring us back back in contact with who we really are that's why the message came heyen listen friends the message didn't came so we can know who William brandom is because because God Vindicated him we had to have him had to have a messenger had to have somebody who would restore had to have the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 had to have the Fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 and we had to know that that's part of our Revelation but that came so you can know who you are because just knowing who somebody else is does not give me the victory what gives me the victory is when I know who I am according to the word and I can take my position in this Bible sir amen almighty god let's turn to First Samuel if you will with me I love the fact that Samuel didn't have to improve himself change himself change his nature change his occupation changes skill set he didn't have to change anything the only thing that had to change was his thinking and when his thinking changed he already was everything he needed to be amen right in order to have Victory he was already everything he needed to be to win the day because he was Israelite amen he was Seed of Abraham he was in the promised land he was a recipient of the promise listen I don't think we have to change who we are our occupation our position I think we just need to move forward with the revelation of the word 1st Samuel 17 need to turn there myself 1st Samuel 17:33 this is when Goliath is coming and making his great boast and when he boasts everybody runs away afraid even Saul whose head and shoulders Above the Rest of the army of Israel he's hiding but the little Shepherd Boy comes along to bring cheese and bread and and wine to his brothers and the captain of the host and see how things are going and and uh he becomes a big problem for them and the reason he becomes a big problem for them is he's not afraid they're all afraid but he's not afraid and because he's not afraid he's a big problem for all of them because they're afraid I love it and so word gets up to Saul that there's a there's a little runt in the camp that thinks he can fight Goliath and so uh uh Saul calls for him and has this discussion with him and let's pick it up in verse 331 17 and 33 1 samel 17:33 and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth you are not able what was Saul looking at Saul was looking at the outside he was looking at the flesh the circumstances he was looking at what most people call reality but that reality was not reality the Unseen was the reality the scene was not the reality so he's looking at a Shepherd boy he's looking at a small boy he's looking at him standing there in whatever he would have wore that day no armor no armor plating no weapons he's got a bag a shepherd's bag he's got a sling in that bag he's got a staff maybe sandals and who knows what kind of garment he didn't show up for for battle so he looks at him and he says listen you can't go he's a warrior and you're just a youth and he's been a warrior since he was a youth he's he's you're outgunned he's out he's out you're out trained he he's he's got skill he's got weapons he's got size he's got everything that you don't have yeah right but n David knew he had something Goliath didn't have Goliath had so many things that David couldn't match David couldn't match his armor David couldn't match his stature David couldn't match his strength David couldn't match his skill in war David couldn't match anything when it came to the external he had nothing to match but he had one thing that Goliath didn't have and he knew that one thing was enough he goes to verse 34 and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing Heath defied the armies of the Living God David had an experience with God and that experience with God was was listen The Experience David had was when David was in his position as a Shepherd amen right that was his position when he was in his position was Shepherd yeah that position he was in was not Warrior that position he was was not captain of the host the position he was in was Shepherd and when he was a Shepherd Faithfully fulfilling the duties of a Shepherd here comes a lion and here comes a bear and so he goes out as he is as a shepherd with a revelation of who he is and he smites the lion and he smites the bear he rescues the Sheep he brings them back to the fold and now he stands and he gives this experience Amen to he gives this experience to Saul and what he's telling Saul is sa listen don't worry about strength don't worry about listen the lion had teeth and Claws I don't have teeth and Claws the bear had teeth and Claws and thick skin they had muscle they had weight they had every advantage over me quit looking at all of that amen there was something else in me that they didn't have amen praise the Lord and he says now then then that here's the this is the key to me he says I slew verse 36 I thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine this was what he said all the way back when he first heard Goliath boast and when he boasted and everybody ran and hid David was like where are you guys going why is everybody hiding in their tents as Goliath say is out there boasting send me a man and you know what he says he says what will the King give to the man that slays this uncircumcised Philistine look at the title he gives Goliath he doesn't call him a warrior he doesn't call him a giant he doesn't call him anything what he does is he positionally places Goliath and he positionally places himself this is an uncircumcised meaning he's not part of the word he's not part of the promise he's not Seed of Abraham he has no Covenant with God Amen he's got sure he's 9 foot tall sure he's got a spear like a Weaver's beam sure he's stronger than five men sure he's got he's been a soldier since he was a child sure he knows how to do it but I'm not looking at that I'm looking at a promise of God he sent through a prophet amen and he's uncircumcised and what's David what what is David pointing to when he says this uncircumcised Philistines he's pointing to the fact that he's circumcised he's part of the Covenant he's part of the promised word he's Seed of Abraham he doesn't defeat Goliath by strength he doesn't defeat Goliath by wisdom he doesn't defeat the Goliath by changing his position he defeats Goliath by a revelation what Revelation the revelation of who he is we can we can have all kinds of Revelation that's right revelation of the church age of Messengers revelation of the correct doctrin and and they are all extremely important revelation of the seventh messenger and the seventh angel and revelation of what the mystery of the seals were revelation of the Thunders but all of that came to bring you the greatest Revelation you'll ever have and that Revelation is who you are in God who you are in Christ that's the Revelation that wins the victory brother B says I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that you might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of God Amen see you always were the sons of God see for for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well when he before he even become material on Earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he knowed the color of hair you would have he knowed all about you is that the truth yeah is it true about you amen not just it's true because I read it not just true because brother bam said it that we know that's true that's a given he's been Vindicated we have faith in that it's true but the reality has to strike home that's true about me be before there was a molecule before there was Stardust before there was a speck of anything I was part of God Amen and that Revelation is what the spiritual Amnesia has to break all of us to bring us back in contact with so that we're not always afraid of everything we face in life turn with me to Ephesians chapter 3 listen friends this message came to set us free this message came to put us back in our position that's right this message came to break the spiritual Amnesia amen oh praise be to God amen amen I find so many times I find so many times that we're sitting waiting for something to happen waiting for something to change waiting for some super duper thing to happen waiting for some gift to drop in waiting for some man to come along shamgar no doubt listen No Doubt shamgar was waiting saying oh if God would raise up a warrior if God would if God would bring back Joshua oh if we had Joshua again right if we had one of those Warriors who first drove out the Philistines if Caleb was here again oh if oel was here oh we would oh we would drive him oh it would be glorious we'd go back to our promise we'd live happy like we did before but he didn't realize the overcoming was in him right not outside of him in him because of who he was that's right because of what God promised him because of what the word says it was him he's looking for somebody else and so many times in our lives friends we're looking for somebody else to rescue us somebody else to come and and if somebody could just come and give me a word of the Lord that can happen and when that happens we thank God for it but don't wait on that because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world what has been placed in you amen is greater than any obstacle you will ever face on this Earth he that is in you the seed Gene of God tell me the SE Gene of God can't conquer what you're facing in your life we're looking for Heroes and God's trying to show himself Mighty in a many membered bride amen a farmer housewife a carpenter a mailman a young boy a young girl teenager a young adult that's where God wants to to defeat his enemy yeah amen amen listen friends don't wait for the hero to come along the hero's in you he's returned where is he he's in his bride we say he's in his bride but greater is he that's in you he's got to be in me I can't face the obstacles of the day with my strength with my wit with my understanding amen I can't just say oh God send me a hero he is my hero and he's already come to me it's already filled me with his Spirit he's always Quicken the seed of life within Me Greater is he that's in you amen than he that's in the world amise God when shamgar recognized that he defeated the devil when David recognized this is an uncircumcised Philistine and I'm a circumcised Israelite Seed of Abraham he won the battle Yeah when we recognize who we are and what God has promised us and what he wants to do in this age we'll win the battle we will overcome amen he says in uh Ephesians chapter 3 Let's look there says uh chapter 3: 16 let's go to verse 16 that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith amen that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in Us in us not to us not Upon Us in US Amen in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all the ages World Without End what is this Revelation that we need he said we need to be strengthened with might back to verse 16 by might with his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith amen that you being rooted and grounded in love like listen we have to stop looking at physical things that's right and look at what faith sees amen this is Paul writing this do you believe Paul was a mighty warrior of God do you know Paul was beaten several times he was beaten with rods he was beaten with whips the historians believe that he was beat in his back so his back laid bare and beaten with with rods and with stripes so many times that he walked hunched over because of the scar tissue on his back do you know that he had a thorn in his flesh that was a limitation physically brother Brenham alluded to the fact that it was a problem with his eyesight and he had to have people write letters for him and you know he was rejected and Cast Away and got so one time he didn't even have a coat for the upcoming winter was asking a friend to bring his coat so here's half blind hunched over beat up beat down rejected Paul you know what he is he's a mighty warrior he's an overcomer he's defeating the devil not by his outside appearance and not by the circumstance where is that mighty warrior that's overcoming the devil in his AE he's in jail yes sir he's in prison yes right what the mighty warrior that God was send in that age to help his children overcome the one who would be the example for all the church ages the one who would write the New Testament that all of us would grain strength from the one that the prophet of the end time would turn us back to the teachings of Paul where is that mighty warrior that's defeating the Devil he's in jail he's cold and he wants his coat and everybody's left him all alone and forsaken him we got to stop looking at the outside quit looking in the mirror but look in this mirror and find out who we really are because we are the children of God where is Christ he's in you amen so we need to be that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love what's he trying to do he's trying to reveal his love for you that's right amen remember we heard it Wednesday his love is a the fact that he chose you before the foundation of the world that you're part of him that's his love and his love can't fade it can't change it's constant it's unchanging and just like our brother Andre was saying on Wednesday it just thrilled my heart to hear him say it and when you were doing the right thing God didn't love you more when you were doing the wrong thing he didn't love you less because God's love doesn't change we have old Armenian ideas about God's love going up and down we're going up and down God's staying constant his promise is constant his love is constant what he thinks of us is constant it's not changing our minds our emotions ourselves are all over the place so we feel like a Son of God we don't feel like a Son of God brother Bram had a question somebody said to him one time brother Bram sometimes I don't feel like I'm saved brother B said sometimes I don't feel like I'm saved but I'm not saved based off my feelings I'm saved by faith in God's promised word it's by faith you are saved and that's a GI so now in Ephesians he wants to root you and ground you in his elective love so that you have a foundation in his love so you're not tossed all over the place because his love is not changing if he ever loved me he always loves me praise God and you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend so you might comp comprehension is based off my understanding of God's election amen you understand that we have to be rooted and grounded in love that we may comprehend amen yeah I want to know God but you don't know who you are and you don't know how much he loves you right is that right I just whacked this thing right off my ear it's what happens when a fly flies in your ear while you're preaching you get in a fight with yourself so God is trying to root and ground Us in his elective love so that we have a foundation in his love so we can comprehend I wonder if sometimes we're trying to comprehend the bread and length and depth and height what is the breath and length and depth and height it's the revelation of Jesus Christ it's the message that been delivered to us and we're trying to comprehend the height and depth and length and breadth we're trying to comprehend all of that and how are we trying to comprehend it amen we're trying to comprehend it with no Foundation of election and predestination and we keep getting confused and we keep wondering and we keep doubting about ourselves we got to come back he wants you rooted and grounded in his elective love that you can be able to comprehend the with the Saints what is the breath and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church amen that's where he wants to be glorified in us that's where he wants to show his glory show his might that's where he's working abundantly he's working in us praise be to God shamgar had to get a deeper Revelation he had to have the spiritual Amnesia broke off and he needed to believe he was it's true and I can as long as he didn't believe he could he couldn't but when he believed he could he could yeah as long as Saul and the armies of Israel believed they couldn't then they couldn't but God brought a little Shepherd boy who believed he could yeah and because he believed he could he could amen Hey listen there's billions of people on the Earth who don't believe they can and they can't they can't be God's representation they can't be Christ manifest on the earth they can't be the Bride of Jesus Jesus Christ because they don't believe they can they can't amen and listen that that's that's what's so sadome sometimes about even those that we fellowship with and go to church for years with and sit and listen to the preaching of the word because they don't believe they can be bride they can't it doesn't mean they're not predestination is predestination but they can't move into the promise they can't move into the realities they can't seem to grasp aold amen of what God has done for us and have overcoming faith and overcoming power because they don't believe they can be but oh God break the Amnesia off of us and open our eyes so that we realize who we really are who we really are and what the promise really is and it's true and I'm part of it and I can not because I have ability nothing has to change in ability what has to change is revelation because God has already provided everything we need to overcome amen shamgar had the the ox go that's all he needed listen if he didn't have an ox goat and he had a pitchfork he would the one with the Pitchfork he went with what he had what did David go with that Saul tried to arm him Saul tried to get him a little bit better Theology and you know brother B expains I tried to get him a helmet and armor and and he got him all looking like a warrior and he said I can't do this I've never proved any of this he went the way he was he went himself he went a Shepherd boy amen but this Shepherd boy had an anointing on him from a prophet to be a king and he had an experience with God On The Backs side of the desert and he knew who he was and he knew the promise of God and he knew this was an uncircumcised Philistine and I'm a circumcised Israelite it's all he needed to know there was a whole lot of things he didn't know yes sir how long is the fight going to take what is it going to be how will he die I don't know if God showed him in a vision or not he may have known but he didn't have to know amen they could have asked him a whole bunch of questions and he could have answered I don't know to a slew of questions but that didn't change anything in who he was and where his faith was he overcame by faith let's turn to First John together first John chapter 4 we've been through the scripture many times but it has impact on me every time I read it and I want it to have a greater impact amen first John 4:17 hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world Amen that means I'm like him in this world that's where our love is made perfect that's what gives us boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world that's a tremendous Revelation Verse 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear have torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love amen we love him because he first loved us this Revelation comes right back to election again he loved me before the foundation of the world he didn't love me when I gave my heart to him he didn't love me when I did nice things he loved me before the foundation of the world he loved me because he chose me he loved me because I'm part of him he loved me and his Love's never changing and so now this is what makes our love perfect this Revelation that as he is so am I in the world and then with that revelation of love I love him because he first loved me so this is elective love on display and a revelation of what he's called me to be and that love cast out fear amen because fear have torment you realize telling yourself not to be afraid is not working whistling in the graveyard is not working I mean you know and and talking big doesn't work either we try to sound like we're not afraid as hopes that maybe we won't be afraid but it doesn't work what cast out fear is perfect love what is that perfect love that perfect love is based off a revelation that as he is so am I in the world and we love him because he loved me first this is his election and this is my position and election and position brings us into the reality of Love That Will cast out fear this is what shamgar came to listen don't tell me shamgar wasn't afraid don't tell me when he heard the troops coming Trump Trump trump every year to come don't tell me he wasn't afraid you can't tell me Gideon wasn't afraid when he was behind the wine press threshing out a little bit of wheat to have a little bit of grain for the year you can't tell me he wasn't afraid amen he was afraid but what began to change the circumstance what began to change his fear when he realized what God thought of him when he realized God loves you God's chose you you're you're a chosen vessel of God and he's with you and he's going to be in you and he's going to work the victory through you and all of a sudden he wasn't afraid anymore and and brother B tells us shamgar wasn't afraid he went out there amen he was ready to fight and he wasn't afraid does there any sign of fear in David's voice when David's talking to Saul when he's running out to the battle and Goliath starts laughing and mocking at him is am I a dog that you come at me with sticks and you little boy I'm going to I'm going to cast your I'm going to put you on my beam and and set you up for the birds to eat your flesh and and those are those are nasty things amen and this is a big dude saying it with a big spear you know somebody starts talking to you like that in the Walmart parking lot with a spear that's 9 foot long he me you you know you look at him you look at his muscles you look at his Spear and you look at you but there's no sign of fear in David yeah cuz David had a revelation right listen that the doctor can tell you whatever he tells you amen you can't stop human emotion human emotion's human emotion but when that Revelation hits it changes everything when that Revelation is I'm a Child of God and his word is true and the promise is true I'm holding on to the promise and all of a sudden fear starts to take Wings you can't push it out by being a bully that's right you can't override it by talking tough but the when the Revelation begins to settle in wait a minute God's word hasn't changed in the last five minutes when I just heard that that all of a sudden I have this terrible terrible thing that they're talking about that news didn't change God's predestinated plan for my life that news didn't change who I am that news didn't change the Bible that news didn't change the promise I'm sticking with the word and love cast out fear amen when brother Benham comes and he preaches the seventh seal when he gets to the seventh seal he starts talking about the third pool and I'm going to talk about that just briefly for a minute and and he's in the seventh St he's preaching he says and just then he picked me up he's going back to the vision uh of the three pools and back now he's to the part where the big tent is and he took me up and set me way up high to where I a meeting was going on looked like a tent or Cathedral of some sort and I looked and there was a little box like little place over in the side and I seen that light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see there in the picture it Whirled away from me like that and went over to that tent and said I'll meet you in there and said this will be the third pool so he's tying the tent Vision the little room in the tent and the little box he's tying it together with the third pool and he says this will be the third pool and you won't tell it to nobody amen then he goes to Sabino Canyon in the Sabino Canyon he just just a short time before he's preaching this amen just a month or I think a month before he's in Sabino Canyon praying and he's got his hands up and a sword strikes his hand and when that sword strikes his hand he looks at it and it's real he's holding in his hand said it just fit his hand it was glistening and he had all these thoughts about it but God told him he said that's the king sword and here's what brother B said that it talk goes back to the tent to the little room and he says I'll meet you in there this will be the third pool and you won't tell it to nobody and in sainia Canyon he said this is the third pool amen so there's no question about what the third pool is the third pool amen what whatever the tent was in the little room and people going in the tent amen and the angel of the Lord being there that Pillar of Fire being in there was the same thing that happened in Sabino Canyon when the sword hit his hand that will be the third pole this is the third pool amen so we don't need to question what the tent is in the little room it's the third pull he's showing it in symbol form just like the sword is symbol form just like the tent in little room and the pillar of fire and people going symbol form so don't get hung up on the symbols again seven seal he still I'm still reading he says the voice shook down through there and Rock The Rocks it's the sword of the king and then I come out of it the sword of the king not if it said a sword of a king but it said the sword of the king and there's only one the king and that's God and he has one sword that's his word that what I live by that so help me God standing over this holy desk here with this holy word laying here it's the word amen so what is the third pull it's the word it's the opening of the word it's the word coming into the hands of the prophet and he said it just it's the king's sword and we know that the sword of the spirit is the word of the Lord amen and it just fit my hand so it's the word coming to the prophet of the hand the hand of the Prophet so that he can dish it out and give it out to the bride amen so we know that the third pool is the word and in the in Sab again it's the word coming to the hand of the Prophet but the third pool was also people lined up around the corner going into a little room one by one and coming out on the other end different than they came in amen amen so don't be afraid to let the symbols amen be symbols and don't let the third pull amen don't don't make it simplistic don't don't fail to miss what God's trying to show us under this third pool Ministry am and and if I I'm going back to 1956 and I'm going to read to you the in February of 1956 the first time brother bam talks about this vision and he says there was a nice smooth spoken gentleman stepping out and said now while brother branham's arresting a little bit we'll line the prayer line up I think that's kind of interesting while brother bren's resting a little bit we'll line the prayer line line up said you all with prayer cards beginning at a certain place line up to my right and so I looked over that would be to my left from where I was standing and there was a little building sitting in there little building that's built like that and all the people were old just looked like went around the tent and out a city block or more a great line of people they were all standing around there with their prayer card just when I seen a woman in an ambulance stretcher was laying and a man behind her was standing on crutches so they were standing there waiting for their turn there was a lady taking down their names and things and and then there was a canvas stretched here and no one could get around that tent and just then now I want you to watch this and listen now it listen how it is now so you watch the difference then I heard something whip around a were were were like that always going every time we have a healing service that's just what happens that's the way it has always sounded sounded that way in the bush that time when I heard it it's always been that way and I felt it I heard it rather going moving and I looked and here went that real soft light moving away from me and went down and went into that little building and there's a there's something different between the light and the angel cuz he was still here with me and that light had went into the building and this Angel still speaking behind me which is a big man he said I will meet you in there so then I said I don't understand why in there he said watch and this woman when she come out of there there an ambulance stretcher she was pushing the stretcher out the other side so he had seen her in the vision standing there on an ambulance stretcher going in and he watched her come out the other side and she was pushing the stretcher and walking yeah amen goes on to say and the lady the lady asked her what happened she said I don't know it just happened amen she said' I've been in this stretcher said I've been down in bed for years and here come the man out packing his crutches and they asked him what said he said he he said he didn't know and he was coming to the platform to testify and I said I don't understand that in there and I watched he's now watch he's always scripture he said did not our Lord say when you thou prayest be not like the Hypocrites that make a show enter into the secret closet and when you've done so close the door then pray to your father which seeth in secret and he that see in secret shall reward thee openly he said you remember that name that you were hunting that time you dreamed about said yes he said I'll meet you in there and this time it won't be a public Show and The Vision left me amen I just love these things because to me they become more and more real all the time we've talked about them for years we've looked at them and we've looked at them with confusion we've looked at them with misunderstanding and still today I don't know that I can completely understand everything that he said but it's becoming more of a more of a reality that that is the third pole he said that will be your third pole and you won't tell to nobody and Sabino can and the sword in his hand this is your third pull so whatever that is and whatever the sword is is linked together in the third pool amen it has something to do with the with the pillar of fire Christ himself in that little room and people going in one way and coming out hole the other way oh my I think think that the third pole has something to do with the word coming to the prophet and that word coming to the prophet brings us into an individual introduction to Jesus Christ the same way Paul met him amen spiritual union he met him as a pillar of fire on the road to Damascus and now that presence was in that room and they went in one by one this isn't church this isn't group this isn't family this is you coming in contact in the third pool with Christ himself The Living Word of God and when you meet Christ in the little room amen it's not a public show amen it's not anything somebody can copy it's not anything that even anybody can explain it's not to be replicated it's not to be a formula it's to be a living reality inside of you that you have come in contact with the person of the third pool which is the word that has been restored in this hour and it changes you everybody in that line is Afflicted with some sort of Affliction crutches and wheelchair and all of that but they come out and and she's pushing the the wheelchair the man in the crutches doesn't need his crutches anymore amen listen don't think physical think spiritual if you're looking for the third pool to produce a prayer line where people don't need crutches and wheelchairs anymore listen God has already done that he did that in the first and second pole that's not the third pull the third pole goes deeper than flesh the third pole is fixing your spiritual condition the afflictions through the soul what was holding us back where the Holy Ghost have been bound by these denominational Rivers for all this time but is loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Ghost backing the people your spiritual condition that came through the church AE and den nomination and man's ideas and all kinds of confusion is under this third pool going to be [Applause] healed brother brenon went through the third pool do you believe that yes do you believe he was in a little room all by himself when the angel came to him every day amen said I've been alone in that little room and he come out on the other side and he said my Bible's a new book something changed in him spiritually he was the same stature he was still baldheaded he was still 50 some years old he would go on to say uh uh I'm getting old now that brother gave me a a cane looks like I'm going to have to use it now after after the seals he says I wake up and you always got a new pain a new Creek and new that he still had a nervous condition he still got the blues he still had tension he still got depressed so the third pole is not fixing all of your natural problems you're still living a natural life the third pole is fixing your spiritual problem it's fixing the soul it's bringing you back into what God always meant for you to be a son or daughter of God it's Awakening what woken shamgar what was awakened David amen under the anointing of this prophetic Ministry it's bringing you to the realization of who you are and what you're destined for you're anointed to be the Bride of Jesus Christ you're anointed to be the queen that sits with him and rules and Reigns and now will I'm coming into that position I know who I am I know where I'm at I know the word that's promised to me and if I face Goliath I can face Goliath because I know who I am amen that's the amen not because when I come to this Revelation all my problems went away listen my problems didn't go away you know still sometimes wake up and limp in the morning because I got a stiff heel and there's a tendon that's whatever and you know you just keep walking because you know it'll work itself out still have all kinds of things that happen in life life still listen the the the meeting of Christ in the little room when Christ is revealed personally to you that's right it doesn't take all your problems away it gives you the ability to overcome every problem it gives you strength establishes you and Roots you and grounds you in love so that you might know the the height and depth and breadth and width of this revelation [Music] that he might do a mighty work in you that's what the purpose of the third pool is and because he wants to show himself Mighty and he wants to overcome and he wants to overcome in you like he did shamgar like he did David then guess what's going to happen to you all kinds of problems sir piles and piles of problems tons and tons of trouble why cuz greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and he's going to prove it he's going to manifest it he's going to prove it he's going to show there's a people that'll stay with my word there's a people who won't back down from the promise there's a people regardless of the circumstances will still say God is good I know the truth and I'm pressing [Applause] on Amen almighty god brother BM says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says you know now you see the seals now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him so it's the Lamb's Book of Life all that's in the book is him then he goes on to say all that's in the book would be him do you believe that amen am everything that's in that book of redemption is him then he says for that's the believer the words in the book am the book I thought everything written in the book was him but yet the words in the book is [Applause] me oh does 2 + 2 equal 4 what brother B said when he's sitting in the woods and he's got his little tablet he's waiting there and the spirit begins to move and all a sudden it's like this 2 plus 2 equal 4 2 plus it gets louder 2 plus 2 = 2+ 2 I love the way he says that he may have grabed just anything that come to his mind he may have used just any analogy but the analogy is giving you a proper conclusion that this plus this equals this right this plus this equals this if everything in the book is himym and the Believers is the word in the book then what are the Believers 2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 = 4 and tell brother bom jumps up and runs and runs and runs around the tree because 2 plus 2 equals 4 and now we know who we are and why we cannot lose it has nothing to do with my mind my temperament my abilities uh my experiences who I grew up with what my name is has nothing to do with that it has everything to do with the fact that I'm one of the words in the book and all that's in the book is him and he cannot lose [Applause] praise God this is how we overcome not the delusional idea that if I'm a bride of Christ everything I say is going to make everything better and I'm going to have power and with that power I'm going to make sure I never have a problem again and the refrigerator breaks and I smack it and it comes working again and my car breaks down I said no no not today listen friends you're going to pay a mechanic you're going to buy a new refrigerator it's not a illusional Pentecostal idea it's the reality of overcoming overcoming what adversity overcoming everything Satan's Eden can throw at the bride she'll overcome not by power not by might but by thy Spirit sayeth the Lord by a revelation that God is in me working through me if I can just hold steady and stay with the promise God is going to work a victory what happens is fear sets in and under fear we are doing all kinds of crazy things but if we could just have an Awakening of real faith and Hold Steady and remember who we are and remember what he promised and remember the hour we live in and remember where he's working and just say I don't know how I have no idea how but it's going to work out for the glory of God we will overcome this situation amen not because I have the faintest idea how it's going to work but it can't fail because his word Can't Fail praise be to God brother mam says in the rising of the sun he says you believe that we shall rise in him we become part of him the Easter the revealed Secret Of God like it was then after uh life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sins and trespasses the true Easter seal has broke death from around me and I'm alive the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the e seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now oh I love when he amen he pointed back to what happened at the resurrection of Jesus Christ but he didn't leave it there that's the problem every denominational teaching leaves it 2,000 years ago but not then now but now God by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in US amen for now we are quickened with him you know what we need we need a revelation of Jesus Christ amen that's right amen but we need a revelation of where Jesus Christ is yes sir because that's what the message came to show us yes sir amen is where he would be in the end time when the head comes and unites with the body that he would be in her amen that's the Revelation that we need friends we need to realize that by the Holy Spirit he has broke to seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in US amen what Resurrection seal is broke this time the seal that was around my life that veiled my understanding the Amnesia seal the denominational seal the human seal the the mental seal was broke from around my life so that I could see Christ revealed that's right in me am praise God then brother Brenham sings a song We shall rise Hallelujah we shall rise amen when death's bars are broken we shall rise Hallelujah we shall rise and listen to what he says aren't you glad I'm so glad Way Back Down Yonder in a little old Coal Shed one morning the seals were broken and I raised with him a new creature brother BR know when the seal broke for him but as the seal broke for you that's right not I don't mean the break breing of the seal to understand that God sent a prophet and that there's a message know sir but a further breaking of the seal where the seals broke from your life and you see Christ revealed as he lives in you to where you come to the great Revelation at the end time Christ in you the hope of glory brother benam says in the message adoption from 1960 when he's coming to preach adoption he says this this is the first part of adoption says Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I think is a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus what's he preaching adoption ad positional placing of sons and he says now I think we need to come to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ and some sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother beer that teaching goes beyond that especially to the church now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is what he is in God's mind yeah amen teaching places a man positionally what he is now listen to The Nest statement and we can never never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are what gave David the faith to overcome positionally he knew what he was well gave shamgar the victory I mean the power of Victory positionally he knew what he was that's what gave brother brandom the power to go and do the things that he had to do that's what gives you and I the power to overcome is when we position we have faith because positionally we know who we are listen I Know Who I Am by natural birth I I understand it you know I I know my parents I lived with them I talked to them they show me the pedigree I've got my document from the hospital I know where I am by that birth but that hasn't done me a bit of good that's caused all my problems but I need to know who I am by another birth certificate by the Lamb's Book of Life birth certificate I need to know who I really am so that I can overcome the trials amen I want to I want to close out and just look at job for a minute as we finish up here if you can turn with me to the Book of Job please praise God Almighty in the Book of Job we're going to go to chapter one we're going to start right at the beginning Job chapter 1 verse 6 now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and esth Evil just pause for a minute God calls him perfect a perfect man that means he's come to the stature of a perfect man just watch our types this is an Old Testament type he says perfect means fully mature or complete so he's come to the stature of a perfect man and the Lord said unto him uh said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and esth Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said do job fear God for not Hast not Thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance increased in the land but put forth thou thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and so I don't know about you but if God was having that discussion about me when he said he's a perfect and upright man oh man you know your heart would be glowing your feet would be lifting off the ground this is what God is saying and then when Satan says yeah I know but but it's because you blessed him I would look at Satan and be like shut up but he says you know just touch his life take all his stuff and he'll curse you you know if you were listening to that conversation is about you you'd be like tell him no God tell tell him no and God says go ahead that was the whole point from the beginning yeah you remember when Wednesday when brother Andreas said that we always look at silence when the father's silent is a negative but when the father silent is a positive job was getting ready to enter into the trial of his life and God was not going to speak to him no vision no dream no Audible Voice nothing in fact all of his feelings were going to go the opposite direction he was going to go through the trial of his life and God was going to speak to him and we realize by reading the scripture and understanding that first God allowed Satan to to afflict him and he lost all of his wealth he lost all of his camels all of his donkeys all of his sheep all of his servants and all of his children in one day and one day he lost everything and in verse 20 let's look at chapter 1 verse 20 after he lost everything says then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped water response friends you know why he worshiped because he was a perfect man and upright yeah this is the way we're supposed to act amen he fell down upon the ground and he worship and said naked came I out of my mother's womb naked shall I return there the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord amen and all this job sin not nor charge God foolishly amen it's very evident by the story that God was not angry with job he was not punishing job he he in no way was mean angry upset job had not done anything wrong actually if we can wrap our minds around it God was proud of job amen right and God thought a lot of job and he let the worst trial of his life come upon him because he was proud of him and he thought a lot of him and he knew what was in him you see how carnal thinking is never going to win the day carnal thinking will derail us every time friends cuz every time our life starts to unravel and fall apart and we have a series of events in our life that keep taking us down we keep thinking Lord what's wrong with me where am I wrong why are you angry with me what have I done wrong if you just show me I'll fix it just show me I'll fix it just show me I'll fix it and there's nothing wrong with that prayer we should search Our Lives there's nothing wrong with that but in reality because bad things happen doesn't mean because you've done something wrong it does not mean God's angry there's a very good chance that when really bad things happen to you that God's actually kind of proud of you and he knows what's inside of you and he knows that he can manifest himself in you through this somebody else couldn't do it they may collapse they may say something wrong they may they may bring a reproach but not you sometimes people say things like you know they get they get a diagnosis the doctor will say you've got heart disease you've got cancer and you say you you say say the the first thing pops out of mind why me God why did you let this happen to me I mean that's not bad question I don't even think God gets angry at that so don't misunderstand me we live a human life with human emotions amen we say why me listen we if we stop and think for a minute you say who else would I rather him put this on my brother my sister and my spouse if somebody has to carry this burden why do I wish it on somebody else amen why me why why' you let this happen to me why me me somebody's got to overcome all of the devil's tricks amen and maybe it's you because he knows that you won't lose faith that you'll keep believing that you'll keep pressing that's right and he knew this about Job brother Brenham says in Victory Day says now remember God has counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail this to get this when you have a trial or a test that shows the grace of God has found you you found favor with God the Lorden thank you God thank you for telling me the truth yeah thank you for reminding me of the truth you know this isn't the first time you and I have heard it but every time we hear it it does something for us because the the devil's lying to us all the time our minds are lying to us circumstances are lying to us and we have to constantly be brought back in contact with God's truth that's not his disapproval that's right right he says listen he says when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found you you found favor with God and God believes that you can stand the test remember he's never done anything to to you to destroy you he's only putting it on you to declare his glory through you amen so that he can manifest himself through you and that he can show himself to you and show himself to others through you and and he goes on to say he says remember he did the same thing by job Satan said oh yes I see job down there God said he's a perfect servant there's none in the earth like him there's nobody like job he's a perfect man now he's my pride and joy I don't know about you but this is not how I've pre treated my pride and joy because man's thoughts are not as high as God's thoughts Satan said oh sure he gets everything he asked for said let me have him once said I'll make him curse you to your very faith face said I'll just make him curse you God said he's in your hands but don't you take his life God had confidence in J listen when the devil told God when when God told the devil hey have you thought about job have you considered him he's perfect there's none like him and and the devil says it's just because you put a hedge of protection around him you you let me touch him and'll curse you to his face you know God didn't say okay okay and God didn't say oh I hope job makes it you can touch him you can afflict him just don't God was not worried God was not nervous God was not upset God was not biting his nails hoping that job made it through God knew what was in him God knew what he built him for God knew what he could do he knew better than job knew and God knows better than you know he knows better than I know sometimes we go through things we think that are absolutely breaking us to bits there's times that the pressure is so great and sometimes it's not physical pressure it's emotional pressure is so great that we think we're absolutely going to break and snap and collapse under this pressure and we say things to God like God I can't take anymore I can't take it I'm falling to pieces amen that's just our own perspective from our human realm but God was never once worried about you falling to pieces and not making it and collapsing he knew you would come through and if something has to be broke out of you then it's going to be broke out of you but you're going going to overcome when the lessons is learned when what has to come out comes out you're going to come out of the trial because he always knew you would there's nothing taking God by surprise so he says God had confidence in job when he looks like everything has gone wrong God is giving you a trial he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around you're not a hot bed plant a hybrid you're a real Christian God is giving you a test SE what you'll do about it to see what you'll do about it amen no wonder Peter said these fiery trials which counted Joy it's more precious to you than gold and many times we hum and haul and oh well well that well that's something God give you to overcome he knows you'll do it he's put his trust in you amen oh God let that Revelation change me because listen friends a trial is always going to end it's going to end you're you're it's going to be a different day you're going to come out of it on the other end you're going to go through you're going to learn something you're going to manifest something you're going to demonstrate something you're going to come out on the other end and when you come out on the other end you're going to kick yourself and feel like a heel for all the things that you said while you're in there so let's catch a revelation right now and say next time God puts trust and confidence in me I'm not going to complain I'm not going to Grumble I'm not going to accuse God foolishly what I'm going to do is say God if you give me strength and you believe can go through this Lord just direct my steps guide me one step at a time show me how to overcome by your word and manifest your life in me now I Surrender oh I surrender to your will I Surrender Lord I I I want healing I want Deliverance I want to come out and I believe I will because there's a promise in your word but through the Journey let me act like you would act in this trial let me demonstrate your faith your love your life let the foundation being rooted and grounded in love may it open unto me a great understanding that I I might have love that passes understanding and takes the fear [Music] away that's when we say foolish things do foolish things and make mistakes is when fear begins to control us but perfect love cast out fear this message didn't come to make us afraid you know brother brandham never come and preached about the Rapture to make you afraid you wouldn't make the Rapture if somebody comes and preaches the Rapture and makes you afraid you won't make the Rapture that is not the message the message came to tell the children of God there's no way you'll ever miss the Rapture it was Secure before the foundation of the world there's nothing you can do to take yourself out of it God put it he wrote it in indelible red ink in the blood of Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world Amen you're going to make the Rapture that's what the message come to take our fear away amen so that we could have faith so that by faith we could know his love so that fear would be abolished so that we could actually manifest the life of Jesus [Music] Christ the message did not come to make us afraid it didn't come to make us afraid of God it didn't come to make us afraid of the missing the Rapture it came to make us fall in love with our bridegroom and Unite with our husband who loves us more than anything else amen it came to bring us security it came to bring us love it came to bring his confidence it came to establish Us in the present truth so that we'd be set firm we'd be rendered constant we'd be strengthened and unmoved that's why the message came not to toss you emotionally from here to there to whip you back and forth and make you feel like I'm not good enough I'm not going to make it that's not what the message is for the message came to establish you to establish you in the present truth to make it where you're not tossed you're not moving you're not falling apart amen am it came to make it so you could stand by what by the preaching of the Gospel by the revelation of Jesus Christ by the by according to the mystery which has been hid since the foundation of the world praise God I said God help me to preach this message right sir help me to preach it true with the true intent and the purpose that it came for to strengthen his bride help me God oh you know that job had two rounds of Trials wasn't just one he lost everything lost all his material Goods lost his children but then when that didn't work he worshiped God Satan comes back before God again and you know Satan didn't mention to God that job was doing good he didn't go back and give a report you know job he he's unbreakable no he just was quiet he presented himself before God again he's probably hoping the subject wouldn't come up cuz God said have you considered him try him touch him and he was so confident if you let me do this I'll curse you do and it didn't happen I'm pretty sure he didn't want God to mention it again yeah in the next meeting he comes up and and you know everybody's reporting you know we're just dramatizing this is going on in this sector this is going on in this sector and and then Satan what's your report well we did this and this and we deceived all these people and all of this okay is that it yeah that's it okay oh just before we close what about job what about job and he says listen flesh for flesh hey he made it through first round one but you let me touch his flesh then he'll curse you you know what God says no I think job's suffering enough that's been hard enough he's already proved all he needs to prove God says go ahead but don't take his life you talk about mind battles job had to go through mind battles you know later in the book job he begins to express some of those mind battles he said he begins to express and what's he expressing I have no idea what God's doing I don't know why this is happening he gets he gets three really nice buddies who come to him to comfort him you know God provides everything you know even the brothers and sisters who say the wrong thing at the right time for the right reason because it's the wrong thing but it's the right thing it's all wrong but it's still right praise Lord does that ever happened to you somebody come along to try to comfort and console you and everything they said was wrong but somehow it's still right in God's plan yeah right that's why you can't even be bitter towards them God's just trying to work something out in us and demonstrate something in US amen there's no reason to be bitter and hurt and upset at everybody else who's ever done us wrong God allows everything to happen in our life for a reason he wants to display himself he wants to mold us he wants to make us he wants to break us he wants to train us wants to form us let God do his work quit being bitter at everybody who said something about you all you're doing is just destroying your own testimony by suling and bitterness and hurt and they hurt me yeah they hurt you everybody's been hurt but it was somebody in the church yeah almost everybody's been hurt by somebody in the church but they shouldn't have well yeah I mean that's the truth they shouldn't have but they did right and did it cross God's desk or not you know we still think like children so God help us to stop thinking like children we're moving into adoption adoption is different adoption is not training wheels adoption is not consoling adoption is not coming and telling you every little thing to do adoption is not coming in cleaning up all your messes adoption is not Daddy fixing everything adoption is you got to figure this out because I put in you what you need you've come to a place in maturity you got in you what you need to overcome and because you got in you what you need you've come to a place of maturity it's in you you've got it I've taught you you've been trained by the Holy Ghost you know the answers to the questions now I'm going to step back and I'm going to let you but it's going wrong it'll come out right but what if they it's going to be okay will they make a mistake obviously they're going to make a mistake but it doesn't matter I've already turned over the checkbook he's already got my signate ring I'm not taking it back if he makes a mess he's got what he has inside of him to clean up his mess adoption is different friends yeah we want a hero to show up and rescue us we want somebody with the gift to come and make it all better that's not how adoption Works adoption is he's got confidence in you he's placed you in a situation and greater is he that's in you than he's in the world the Overcomer is in you amen the overcoming tools are in you you don't need something special be who you are if you're a farmer take your Ox goat if you're a Shepherd take your bag yeah if you're a mama be a mama if you're a daddy be a daddy you don't need a special position you don't need a special gift you are what you are by the grace of God you are who you are by God's position and you as mama you as Daddy you as farmer you as mechanic you are a son of almighty God you are a daughter of God and he's brought us to an adoption age because he's got confidence in his seed and he'll let bad things happen oh God how could a loving God listen we should be long beyond that question read the Bible how could I let how could God let this happen to me we just need to go back at Genesis and start over again listen how could God let this happen to me don't ask listen don't ask job that question he'll just look at you you start complaining about your situ and job would just be like listen just go talk to somebody else God will let it happen because he's got confidence in his seed he's going to manifest himself he's going to show there's a bride on the earth that's not like Eve she stick with this word what did God love so much about job is no matter what happened to job everything listen you I don't think we can fathom how much he lost yeah the amount of wealth he had was unfathomable yes I mean know the number of sheep the number of camel listen camels you don't eat camels camels are not for food camels are semi trucks in the ancient days for transporting goods yeah right and he had hundreds of them right what goods was he transporting this man was a wealthy he was the greatest man of the East yeah he lost everything including his seven children he lost everything in one day then he lost his health then he's picking boils then his wife gets angry and upset and contentious with him the man loses everything but you know what he didn't lose he didn't lose faith in the word for his day never lost faith in the word for his day because when his when his when his friendly friends come along and tell him that job listen listen we we are reasonable human beings and we can look at your situation and we can draw a conclusion you must be a sinner because God doesn't act this way God doesn't do this to his children God doesn't allow these hard trials God doesn't want you to suffer God doesn't want these things to happen to you amen so there's something wrong in your life have you searched your life usually it starts off like this how how's everything with you and the Lord I mean you're having a hard time brother I'm here for you uh I love you um how's things with you and the Lord are you prayed up okay well we're praying for you continues going have you searched your life brother that's helpful I tell you I'm pretty sure when somebody hits a hard trial they've probably searched their life already you're asking them if they searched their life probably is not helpful have you considered that maybe you did this wrong and this wrong and this wrong listen when job faced all of that job says I am not a sinner sir and job is not saying I've done everything perfect job is not saying I have no air brother brandham said job was looking at the sacrifice God's required word for that day was that I slay an innocent lamb to cover my sins I slayed the lamb not only for myself but for my children I have no sin not because I haven't done anything wrong but because I met God's requirement and God was so proud of that no matter what he went through and no matter what he was accused of he stood fast on the word for his day the revelation of his day was the same revelation God showed in Eden that a lamb will cover your sins and he slayed the lamb his sins were covered and he had faith in God's word and God was so pleased with job because job never deviated from that Revelation whatsoever job didn't know what was going on he was confused about why it happened he began to say things that even God told him he shouldn't have said saying God's being unfair with me he should have never said that but he never doubted the word of God he never compromised on the word he never stepped back on the promise that if I do what God says I'm doing I have no sin God loved him because he stood with the word amen job didn't have everything right he didn't say everything right but God was pleased because he stayed with the word amen oh Amen brother B says and the message look from 63 he said job when even all of his friends had turned him down everything was wrong job kept looking towards the sky some of them said you're a secret sinner you're look you're you're looking job what are you looking up that way for because you've done sin God has done proved what he's done to you you're a secret sinner job knowed he wasn't a sinner he had met exactly every word god required that burnt sacrifice that burnt offering was all God asked for now listen friends are you listening God only asked for the burnt offering and job knowed he had made the burnt offering sacrifice God only asked you to believe his word not to live perfect not to never make a mistake not to have up ups and downs what is God asking you to believe his word and what is that word it's the bleeding bloody word that washes you from all your sins and washes you and cleanse you from The Prostitute spirits of these denominations and makes you clean and virtuous and pure virgin bride of Jesus Christ what is it the washing of the water of the word he's not asking you for perfect conduct he's asking you to believe his word God only ask you to believe his word amen he don't ask all these isms and Creeds and and everything else he asked you to believe him am listen it's perfectly okay to say I have no idea why this is happening sure you know sometimes in our spiritual immaturity we try to be spiritually mature yeah so when travesty happens or tragedy travesty is the wrong word my family informed me of that I've used it wrong several times and God knows how to fix Pride thank you I love you all it's so sad that we can so quickly be derailed off of the word and feel like I've done wrong God's mad at me but all those things happen God's just asking us to take him at his word I called you my bride believe it I sent a prophet to call you out believe it I told you what I think of you believe it I told you I chose you before the foundation world just receive it just stay with it just don't change don't go up and down don't go back and forth don't alter anything just say I believe it what's happening to you I don't know you know we used to say well this is happening because of this because I said that and did this and God's doing this and God God's trying to do something with my neighbor and God's trying to do something with my co-workers and it's like how do do you know that that was spiritual immaturity trying to act like we were spiritual mature trying to give an explanation for every trial we go through well maybe this is happening for the medical staff maybe maybe not it could be maybe not we don't have to have answers let's get beyond having to have answers because what we do is we start manufacturing answers we don't need any answers God can do with us whatever he choos to do because what he does is perfect and with a purpose and the reason that we're on this planet is to manifest him regardless of what we think about it what God does is perfect what God allows is right what God predestinated for us to overcome is exactly what we're going to overcome because he predestinated it so we don't have to have answers job got to the place he says he works on my right but I can't find him behind me I don't know where he's at I have no idea what's happening to me actually as we close let's read that I wasn't going to read it I try to shorten stuff and be good and all that stuff but let's go to back to job I just can't help it it's too good friends back to job let's go to chapter 23 here's job in chapter 23 this is the last scripture I want to read leave you with job 231 then jod answered and said even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me if I could just talk to him he would strengthen me there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left where he does work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as goldone my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food where was job where did job get to job got to the fact where I wish I could talk to him I wish I could ask him if I did he would strengthen me he would deliver me I know he loves me but I don't know he's working here I can't perceive it he's on my right I can't see it behind me I don't know where he's at I'm completely confused to why this is happening but one thing I know for sure is he knows the way that I take I don't know what's happening but he knows what's happening in my life and when I am tried I shall for come forth as gold why because I've help held his word more than my necessary meat I've loved his Commandments and held his Commandments more than anything else that's how I know listen friends we can love this message with all our heart hold on to it amen this is God's love letter to us this is God's this is God's identification to us he's telling you you're mine you're Israelite your Seed of Abraham you're chosen you're loved you're my bride all is well between you and I that's what the message is telling us hold on to that word more than your necessary meat more than life love this message and hold on to it friends don't compromise it don't argue about it don't debate it don't disbelieve it just hold on to this promise this message is here to give you a true identification of who you are to root you and ground you in the love of Jesus Christ so that you might understand the width and depth and breadth and height of his great love and you might that his Works might abound Amen in you do we understand what's happening most of the time not super spiritual fakers tell you they always know what's happening in their life I did this so God allowed this and this and this and they make you feel like a heel because you're going through all kinds of trouble and you don't know why and if you did something wrong you don't know because you've asked God and he hasn't showed you anything so all you know to do is keep moving forward and believing his word but they say well this happened to me but it was because my cooworker needed and my wife and then blah blah blah blah blah the end of the day they don't know right but they just don't want to say I don't know job was to the point where he said I I haven't got a clue you asked me hundreds of questions I don't have the answer the only thing I know is I haven't left the word yes amen you say I'm this and you say I'm that and you give me examples and you come around and you tell it again and you try to convince me listen they were what were they doing they were trying to get him to lose his hold of the word by reasonings by fleshly things by things he could see but he held fast to the promise of the word listen the devil and sometimes friends and coworkers they're going to try to get you to lose your grip on the word maybe in the devil will come in year well maybe it's not for you it seems to work out for everybody else it's not working out for you listen just go read job okay the next time he tells you that that's not true why was why was Peter hung upside down and persecuted in prison why was Paul chased from City to city and beaten multiple times stoned left for dead Shipwrecked cast out of cities why was that because he was wrong because he sinned CU he didn't believe the word cuz he wasn't Bri listen friends let's read the Bible and come in contact with the real reality God is proving himself he's doing it through us he sent a message to open our eyes to the truth because the truth will make us free because the truth will root us and ground Us in love amen and perfect love will cast out fear to me that's why why the message came so that I could pass through whatever God's allowed me to pass through but I could do it with the right attitude and I can never let go of this word help me God to never let go of this promised word this message God bless you let's all stand musicians if you please come the next time somebody says what's going on you can say I don't know why do you think this is happening I have no idea and before they say anything to you you might just be better off saying and you don't either but I'll give you the short answer God allowed it does he have to correct me quite likely is he trying to teach me something probably is he trying to display something yes probably is he trying to manifest himself in some way to somebody else likely could be all could be some I don't know but I know this he knows the way that I tell and when I am tried I shall come forth as gold because I have determined that this message is more than my meat more than life to me and I'm never letting go of it praise God let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for your word God it's more to us than life this message Lord came to break us free free from reasoning free from our own flesh free from the things that have been holding us back for Generations God it's so precious we love it so much we love the truth we love you this third pool come to make us spiritually whole so that we could finish your work which you left for the specific time to do in and through us God I yield myself to that work Lord and I want to declare before this congregation that I trust you I trust your ways I don't always understand I I honest from my heart God sometimes I don't know why I don't know why it has to be so hard sometimes I don't know why it has to look so ugly but God I Trust You Lord I trust that if I'm wrong you'll fix me if I have a misunderstanding you'll teach me if I'm wrong you'll correct direct me because you love me because you elected me you chose me before the foundation of the world you're not going to lose me and your love's Not fading away but God I pray if my eyes need open give me more eyesa if I need corrected correct me if you want to use me to manifest yourself you can have me but Lord I want to stay true to this word above all I love you help me to confess your word more than my Serv circumstances confess your word more than what I see let your word your promise be a reality and may you the revelation of who we are in you Trump every
