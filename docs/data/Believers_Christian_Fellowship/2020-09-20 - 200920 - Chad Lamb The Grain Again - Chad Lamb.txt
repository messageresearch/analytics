[Music] there is none like you no one else can touch my heart like you do i could search for all eternity and find there is there is could search for all eternity lord and find there is i [Music] hallelujah and i got a feeling we're going to get to search all through eternity and keep discovering him amen and keep reinforcing that there is none like him and we're going to let you be seated for just a moment man this is an exciting morning for the assembly we're going to ask brother gerai and sister rebecca wholesale if you guys want to come and bring your newest little addition to the family amen we're going to dedicate samantha daniel wholesale to the lord man i looked up this name and samantha means god heard and i believe god has heard their prayer giving them a little girl daniel means god is my judge and so it's an exciting morning dedicate this little girl to the lord amen god bless you praise the lord brother ben said life is a precious thing and when he gives life to a believing family we believe it's ordained it's for a purpose this isn't things that happen to us aren't random it's just not the laws of nature but for us we believe it's god amen so we want to stand together and receive this gift from the lord dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this gift of life that you've given lord to the hands of her brother jeraiah and sister rebecca lord you've heard their prayer you answered them in due season lord you gave them the desires of their heart lord and now they give this child back to you to recognize lord that all life has come from you

danielle and lord they'll shape her lord and they'll do their part lord if you anoint them with your spirit they'll do their part and god we're asking that you would do what no man can do what no mother and father is able to do but he would take this little life this little lick of fire that's down in the soul and that by your word you would spark it to life lord by the baptism of the holy ghost that you would use her every day of her life for your glory that she would be a testimony of your life in light lord as a congregation we stand in support of this family nor we just bind our hearts together with thirst and thank thankfulness and thanksgiving to you for this life and lord we support them as they raise her for your glory let everything we do and everything we say be done for your glory and by your preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you brother amen god bless you both praise god let's all stand god has certainly been good to his children amen we're so excited to see the blessings of the lord amen let's take our bibles and turn to hebrews 13. we'll just start in the word of hebrews chapter 13. we're going to read 13 8 which is a very familiar scripture to us and we all know very well and as we're turning there i just want to remind you that brother emmanuel is today in northern idaho he'll he'll be preaching here shortly there this morning and traveling back then i presume tomorrow and then i also talked to brother benjamin siebold he's going to be going to arkansas next week for preaching for brother david morris in arkansas next week so be praying for him as well let's read here in hebrews 13 and verse 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever i don't know i don't know i've never counted how many times brother brenda quoted the scripture a part of it but it's got to be i mean it's it's got to be 100 or more and this was a theme to him and a theme in his ministry and so this scripture it's it's easy to read it doesn't take very long but i think the full impact of that is still unfolding to us let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this day and for this word and as we look into your word i pray you'd open it for us lord we as human beings lord with the ability to read we can read we can read printed words on printed on paper lord but but it takes you to open up the understanding to us it takes you to give us divine revelation on the word we pray you would do that this morning i pray to you be with our brother emmanuel lord as he's ministering this morning in idaho speak through him use the vessel for your glory and may your bride there be edified as well we give you preeminence this morning in jesus name we pray amen you can all have your seeds let's turn over to to the book of john the gospel of john john chapter one and we'll begin at verse one so we're gonna be reading these two super familiar passages of scripture to us but they just they always get richer every time john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god then you go over to verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glories of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so we read these two scriptures and we want to look at these two together this morning amen we want to look at jesus christ amen the same yesterday today and forever and we know that jesus christ is is the word made manifest amen and we know in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen and so we want to look at the ministry of jesus christ amen but maybe in a broader way than just the three and a half year ministry he had or the 33 year life span that he had in flesh but it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever brother madam says in the message the unchanging god working in an unexpected way from 1962 he says he was brought in the way that israel thought he would be issued in he was not brought in the way that israel thought he would be issued in they thought he'd be a mighty king with a stick in his hand and go out and beat the romans over the head with it but that wasn't god's way that wasn't even the scripture for him to do it in that coming the next coming is when he's going to do that they've got the first and second coming mixed up together so he come then lowly meek setting on a mule riding in and he come out of the smallest city amongst all the big provinces and all the scriptures just fulfilled of his coming the way he will come but they failed to see it see but he did the messianic messier eik sign provided that he would prove that he was messiah and they rejected it because he come in an unexpected way to them now listen he didn't come in an unexpected way because the scripture said how he would come he came in an unexpected way to them so it wasn't god in an unexpected way it was god in an unexpected way to them amen now if they had just been willing to accept him on the basis that god sent him 1958 he says can we see jesus in the message can we see jesus then if christ manifested himself in the closing of the jewish dispensation now listen close the way he did when he manifested himself to the jews because they were looking for him to come and fail to recognize him is that true now the gentiles was not looking for him to come we were heathens in those days worshiping idols but at the close of the dispensation of the jews when they had rejected him the way he manifested himself at the close of the jewish dispensation he will have to do the same thing at the closing of the gentile dispensation or he did wrong for manifesting himself the way he did in his power at the close of the jews and would not do it at would not do it at the gentiles you understand clearly the brother of them says he become at the end of the jewish dispensation and he showed the sign of the messiah and then he discerned their thoughts and intents and he had all the manifestations inside of the messiah amen if he did that at the end of the jewish dispensation he will have to do it again at the end of the gentile dispensation so it's got to be the same thing it's got to be the same display and the same chance amen but he's not he's going to do the same thing he's going to do it the same way but he's not going to do it in the same form amen so he's going to do it but he may not do it according to what the expected way brother bam says in 1962 why i'm against organized religion they believed there was a coming messiah oh them jews they sure but when jesus come the way he did they said that can't be him [Laughter] i love that because when we start talking about the way jesus is coming our day they say that can't be it because this is supposed to happen that's supposed to happen and he's supposed to drive out the roman and you're getting things mixed up you're getting comings mixed up and you're getting dispensations crossed and you're getting out of kilter with the sequence of the word so that that can't be him they fail to understand the word now jesus didn't come contrary to the word did he but he came contrary to the organization interpretation of the word moses didn't come contrary to the word he came exactly with the word but cora failed to see it and all down through it's been that way we live in the same day amen the same things are going on now what's going on then he says in the message who is this melchizedek from 1965 she said sir i proceeded out on a prophet and he's speaking to the samaritan woman at the well i perceive that they were a prophet she said we haven't had one for 400 years now we know that the messiah is coming and when the messiah comes that's what he's going to do that was the sign of the messiah for he was the son of man that's what he's going to do when he comes you must be his prophet he said i am he nobody else could say that she dropped that water pot and run into the city and said come see a man who told me what i'd done isn't this the very messiah now remember he promised to do the same thing at the end of the gentile race he's going to do the same thing but it's not going to look the same way but he's going to do the same thing the jews had four thousand years to look for that messiah four thousand years of teaching he was coming and what he would do when he got there and they failed to see him or failed to recognize it and when he made himself known in the very bible terms that he said he would then he had when he had been a theophany and then become flesh and dwelt among them they failed to see it and called his works the works of the devil now we've had two thousand years of teaching coming down through the roman catholic church after the apostles then we come down through the roman catholic the greek and so forth on down to luther's age in wesley what more 900 different organizations come down they had all these ages teaching now he promised just before the end time would come that the picture of sodom and gomorrah would again as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the end time the son of man will reveal himself again yet a little while and the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for i personal pronoun i will be with you even in you to the consummation the end of the world i will be with you he is the same yesterday today and forever oh my goodness he's the same yesterday today forever but he says the world won't see me but you'll see me you'll see me because i'll be in you i'll be with you amen i will be there not another person not the second person but the same person in another form the world couldn't see it but they could see it because he's the same yesterday today and forever you see the samaritan was actually from my last night's sermon was hagar see a perverted type the jew was sarah the saraite but the gentiles of mary the royal seed abraham's royal seed now it's promised that in these last days that this same god this same christ would come back here and reveal himself as son of man i'm going to read that last sentence again now it's promised that in these last days that the same god this same christ would come back here and reveal himself as son of man so the same god the same christ would come back here and reveal himself as the son of man he's going to do it just like he did at the end of the jewish dispensation amen he come and he revealed the thoughts and intents of the heart he showed the sign of the messiah he sowed the same thing when god came down elohim and flesh on the plains of memory what he showed to abraham he's going to show again to abraham's elect seed at the end of the the jewish dispensation and he's going to come back and do the exact same thing to to the same seed which is abraham's royal seed he's going to show them the sign of the messiah the same thing that he did on the plains of memory so that they will know like abraham knew like they like the royal sea knew at the end of the jewish dispensation and like we know at the end of the gentile dispensation that that that is god in flesh it's just a different form a different manner of manifestation but it's the same god it's the same christ now let's turn together over to ii timothy i'm going to read two scriptures back to back second timothy chapter 3 2 timothy 3 and 8. now as janice and jammers withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith brother is going to have a lot to say about this in a moment in the quotes i'm going to read but janice and jammers withstood moses so do these also resist the truth when they were resisting moses they were resisting the truth they weren't resisting the man the man was just a vessel god was going to use amen but when they resisted moses they were resisting the truth because moses was doing what god told him to do so he was the very manifestation of the spoken word of god and when they resisted that they were resisting god they were resisting the truth so as janice and jamers withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith so so now brother bam says in the le in the last days you're going to have a return of janice and jambries and he said if the and this is what brother baptist says in the anointed was at the end time he said if it's going to be at the end time it's got to be after the opening of those seals because that marks the end time amen the the the ministry of the seventh angel is sounding forth will be the mystery will be finished at the end time amen so now it's got to be after the opening of the seven seals that this is made manifest now jamberry's withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith now let's look turn to luke chapter 18. luke 18 and verse 8. i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth now remember genesis and jammers will reprobate concerning the faith now he's saying nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth now brother branham told us that there's going to be a revealing of the son of man and the revealing of the son of man is the coming of the son of man the son of man comes to reveal himself the same god the same christ comes as son of man so now he says when the son of man cometh now we know when that is when the world's in a sodom condition when once again elohim steps down in the flesh and turns his back to the crowd and begins telling what's going on in the tent behind him we realize we've come to the same place and he says now uh nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth mother branham says in the anointed ones at the end time said it reprobates concerning the truth concerning the faith the faith there there's only one faith that's right concerning the faith reprobates now that's the question here's where i want to go to in revelations 10 we'll go to in a minute in a few minutes and another scripture verse he said in the days of the message of the seventh angel the mystery of god ought to be finished here is the question is if you follow in that line in this hour will it be finished will i find the faith will malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original word now i i'm i mark this down and i highlight this because i want to stop here for a minute brother branham's asking a question he said will i find faith will malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original the word now brother ben is not saying will god send elijah god had already sent elijah that was well established brother branham already knew he's getting here he's in july of 1965 he's not questioning whether or not the forerunner will come he's not questioning whether or not the spirit of elijah has come he's asking whether malachi 4 will be fulfilled because the fulfilling is malachi 4 is a people on the earth who go back to the original word so he's not saying you know will will god send that elijah we'll we'll you know will the forerunner come not that's not what he's asking the son of man is come now he's asking really fine faith on the earth that's the question because janice and james will reprobate concerning the faith what faith the original faith of the original father's the original word that's what they were reprobate concerning is that faith that the the faith of the children turned back to the faith of the fathers brother said the original word so brother baby's not questioning whether malachi 4 and the revelation the the prophecy of malachi 4 has come he's well established in that fact and he knows by the opening of the seven seals that that has confirmed malachi 4 has come elijah has come but now the question is will malachi 4 be fulfilled because that's not brother branham's portion amen his portion was elijah the forerunner amen revealing the son of man but there has to be a people on the earth that will receive that faith of the father turn back to the original word and that will be the fulfilling of malachi 4. and that's where janice and james are reprobate that right there is where the reprobate amen they're not reprobate amen brother bam said they're not reprobate in their life their life is fine they're not reparating their christian works they're not reprobating manifestations they could do all that moses could do they were not reprobate and healing they were not reparate in deliverance they were not reprobating all that they will reprobate concerning the faith which is the fulfillment of malachi 4. so brotherhood says will that's the question when the son of man comes because he knows he's right here he's at the coming of the son of man the revealing of the son of man and malachi 4 has come the forerunner is gone amen now the mystery should be finished now the question is will it be the question is will malachi 4 be fulfilled and i say absolutely right here if nowhere else god let it be fulfilled right here turn my heart back to that original word because i want the word and nothing else not one drop more not one drop less i just want the original word and all of it he goes on in the same quote he says now he just finished saying malachi 4 will malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original the word reprobates jameson chambers as they withstood now also listen ii timothy 3 8 withstood moses also in the last days these same reprobates would come now see where it says here having a form of godliness anointed ones you go back and read it when you get home so that i can finish out this morning reprobates concerning not reprobates in living their fine cultured man not reprobates in character not reprobates in christian works they resisted the truth and they will reprobate concerning the faith the one that the children have been the faith that the children have been turned back to the original word which came at the opening of the seals so all of this comes into manifestation at the opening of the seals because how can you be reprobate concerning the faith until the faith has been restored and when the faith has been restored now you can be reprobate concerning the faith and being shown that you've been resisting the truth because another prophet has come in the same fashion as moses amen and they resisted moses now when they resisted this prophet in the end time amen they're resisting the truth and been found reprobate concerning the faith let's turn to the book of acts now acts 19. acts 19 verse 1 and it came to pass that while apostle was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coast come to ephesus and find his certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what were then were you baptized and they said unto john's baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12. brother ben's going to pick up this same scripture he's going to repeat a portion of this over here in the um the church age book in the section on the revelation of jesus christ he says and it came to pass well paul while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coast came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believed and they said we have not so much as heard whether to be any holy ghost he said unto what were you baptized and they said unto john's baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him now paul the apostle are not paul paul is coming to them and they're referring back to john the baptist the forerunner of his first coming and they're they're they are stuck in the forerunner's ministry you understand these are good people these are real believers these are genuine seed because when they heard more they accepted it right quickly and were baptized in jesus name this is not these are not reprobates concerning the faith these are not individuals who are resisting the truth amen they just not they haven't heard it all amen they heard the forerunner part they grabbed a hold of the forerunner part they were living the forerunner part they were obedient to the forerunner part amen and even you know these were this brother says he goes on to say these were disciples of apollos and apollos was a great scholar and he was going into the synagogues and burning them up showing amen that the messiah would come that jesus would come amen but aquila and priscilla had to take him and show him the way of life more plainly like he he didn't get to the next step he had got to the forerunner to elijah coming amen to lay straight to paths and he had got to malachi 3 he had got the prophecy in isaiah he had seen the forerunner come amen but he hadn't gone beyond the forerunner yet but he was not he was not a reprobate he was not a genus and jamboree he was a true predestinated seed of god and he had come to the point and now aquila and priscilla amen they they don't chastise him they don't scold him they don't make him feel like an unbeliever they just say hey you're doing good let me show you something else because what john was here to do john came to forerun he did that but what he forerunned has already come praise god he said when he goes on it reads the scripture and he says these good people at ephesus had heard about the coming messiah john had preached him they were baptized and repentant of sin looking forward to believing on jesus oh these dear folks at ephesus were fine people and if anyone had a right to feel secure they did notice how far they had come they had come all the way up to accepting the coming messiah they were ready for him but don't you see that in spite of that they had missed him he had come and gone now listen these were like i said not reprobates not resisting the truth they just hadn't heard the rest of it yet they and he says look how secure they ought to have fell because they caught the prophecy amen they caught the forerunner ministry they recognized john the baptist and what he was doing and they were repented of their sins waiting for the messiah to come oh friends there's many times in the message we've caught that god has sent a malachi 4 elijah god has sent amen his word in this day god has fulfilled that portion amen and now we sit so many times repentant and washed out and free from denominational teaching and waiting waiting waiting waiting for something to happen amen for the lord to come for something to happen when it's already happened friends amen and sometimes when somebody's stuck in the forerunner ministry amen they're living it amen they're believing it they're repented they're washed out amen they're standing there waiting for the next step amen all they need sometimes is somebody in love like aquila priscilla and say hey let me show you the way of life more plainly more perfectly can i share with you what i see because they're not reprobates they're not resisting the truth these are children of god they just need to hear amen that the the the revealing of the son of man was the coming of the son of man the same god same christ has come back to reveal himself the son of man don't miss it don't miss it good people feeling secure don't miss it because what john 4 run has come and i'll say what elijah has for run has come let's turn to matthew 16. matthew 16 and 13. matthew 16 13 when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiah are one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god now i'm going to keep reading and brethren and jesus says and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and brother rem says in the message anointing ones at the end time said these trees this true vine and false vine you've heard me preach on that since from years ago how they've grown up together brought them in individuals and showed that from cain and abel the two vines that met in an altar both of them religious both of them anointed both of them desiring life and worshipping the same god and one was rejected and the other received and the only way that the one that was received could have done anything different from his brother it has it was revealed to him for the bible said by faith hebrews 11th chapter by faith abel offered unto god or more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified that he was righteous so brother of em said there's two brothers here's two twins amen they're on the earth both desiring to worship god both working to bring a sacrifice doing all the religious services amen but one brought an appropriate offering and the other one did not amen and the only way that abel could do different than cain was by revelation that's it and cain although he got instruction he could never catch the revelation because god gave him the instructions just do what abel did he got the instructions from god he got the thus saith the lord from god but what he could not catch was that revelation and when he could not catch the revelation he could not keep the word that's why you see people sometimes in the message they struggle to keep the basics of the message i mean uh staying away from tv and and hair and and and make up and dress and conduct and entertainments and all these basic basic basic things and you realize the revelation hasn't struck yet because once the revelation struck strikes it's totally different picture everything looks different everything feels different your whole attitude changes your whole desires have shifted it's not anymore trying by a form of government and and by a a code of rules amen trying to line up and mesh myself into this to be a believer no just be a believer and let god by revelation quicken the seed on the inside and you'll find out the desires for those things just begin to melt away and so abel the only reason he could do different was by revelation the only reason he could receive revelation is because he was a seed of god cain he could get the instruction that's why you can give instruction until you're blue in the face don't cut your hair don't wear makeup don't dress him honestly don't tell dirty jokes don't get caught up in worldly entertainment and you can teach and teach and teach and teach and finally cain will break under that pressure and he'll kill his brother how many times does that happen you preach legalism i can't do that there's no grace here i'm leaving what has cain done he's killed his brother and brother we have to preach those things it's not that we should not preach those things but understanding amen you'll never preach it in such a way that you'll get cain to get catch a revelation you preach it so that abel can catch the revelation so we always preach it but never he said that's why you don't have to preach it harder you don't have to preach it firm or and you don't have to get angry about it you don't have to scream and shout and you don't have to tell people you're going to go to hell and you're going to burn and it's going to be horrible it's going to be the most terrible thing ever you don't have to do that to get able to catch the revelation [Applause] [Music] so many times i think by the forcefulness and the threats and the fear-mongering amen that comes through preaching sometimes i think it's a human effort by human government to get somebody to look like a believer what's the point of looking like a believer if you're not a believer be a believer and god will make you look like a believer praise be to god it's a revelation all of it's by revelation we catch a higher order of understanding our eyes become open and now all of a sudden it's not about it's not about well how short short and how tight is ty all of a sudden it's like wait wait a second i get the picture i'm jesus christ i'm the temple i'm tabernacling deity everybody who sees me is gonna this is the image of jesus christ on the earth today oh now i understand why it matters praise be to god so he says now the only way that that he could have done anything different from his brother was rece it was revealed to him by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified that he was righteous jesus said the spiritual revelation of who he was who does man say i the son of man am he said peter he said peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god blessed out there simon simon son of jonas flesh and blood never revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church what the true revelation of the word there is the true vine again able by faith so now what what he's saying is we don't have to repeat what peter said because if we just repeat what peter said with the same understanding that peter had that day we are still going to miss the true revelation of the word and the church is not built on repeating what peter said with the understanding peter had i hope you understand what i'm saying it's not wrong to repeat the scriptures but amen we have to go amen we have to we have to receive the true revelation of the word in our day and when we recognize that that is christ then we're saying the same thing peter said so peter's talking about the manifestation of jesus christ in flesh god in one body and he's looking at god in one body he asks who do men say that i the son of man am and then they answer well some are this and some are that it's really a divided camp they really haven't come to any conclusion but who do you say by your own personal revelation who do you say that i am he said thou art christ the son of the living god and he said flesh and blood you're blessed because flesh and blood didn't tell you that but my father which is heaven and upon this rock amen not the rock of being able to say that jesus christ 2 000 years ago was the son of god my goodness billions of people can confess that in this day but that's not the rock that's not the rock that he's built his church on he's built his church on the solid unmoving rock of true revelation from the father for the word may manifest in their day it's what held moses's church it's what held noah's church it's what held abraham's church it's the same thing and upon this rock now it's funny that jesus asked this question who did they say i the son of man because we've come right back to the son of man again brother branham said we've got a son of god through the church we had son of man and jesus christ son of god through the church ages amen moving to son of david so there's been three names son of man jesus christ son of god amen the holy ghost through the church ages amen and son of david when he establishes the kingdom on earth through the millennium but he said just between son of god and son of david he comes as son of man again so now it's appropriate in this day to ask the question who do you say this son of man is not that one this one it's still an appropriate question to be asked today not who was the son of man that peter was talking about it's the same son of man he's come to the churches and son of god but he's come back amen the same god the same christ came back in the revealing of the son of man and who do you say this son of man is because the way you answer that question is going to determine what seed is on the inside because only the seed can catch a revelation of who the son of man is praise be to god and we may for years like many of us we may have been moving our way through dispensations amen and come from the church eight dispensations and and see a a forerunner coming to forerun is coming and we see that forerunner and we catch it and we believe it and we receive it with all of our hearts and we go to manifest it and live it and we come to it looking forward saying oh he's forerunning the second coming of jesus christ someday in some day and someday in some day amen becoming the believers at ephesus preaching like apollos and brother said good people children of god disciples believers not antichrist not janice and jamborees amen the reason i know that is because i've been there i've been where apollos was i've been where these believers at ephesus was i had caught john the baptist coming i had caught amen malachi 4 i had caught elijah coming and i gave my whole life to it and believed it and surrendered everything repented from the denominational idea but i was looking someday someday someday until somebody come along and the holy spirit come along and whispered you got to look back he's already come he's here the son of man is here when brother ben said he injects himself as son of man we have to understand that injection a son of man is injected between son of god and between son of david so until he comes as son of david to set up his earthly kingdom in the millennial reign he must remain here as son of man even though the the the a son of man that was revealing the son of man was taken home amen the son of man did not leave when brother branham left because that son of man that come must remain present with us until we come to the son of david manifestation so now i'm going to ask you the question who do you say the son of man is you're like where where like i saw it in brother branham i saw it so clearly i understand the plains of memory i understand elohim and a body of flesh i saw it there there was a man he turned his back to the crowd that was it it was a son of man revealing the son of man i got it but that that manifestation that son of man he left and so now you're saying who is this son of man i'm not asking you who was that son of man in brother branham's day that's not my question today i'm not asking you who that was on the platform with you who it was to discern their thoughts and intent i'm asking you who this son of man is here today who do you say this is where is he and who do you say he is because he's got to be here he's got to be here and remain until we change dispensation of the son of david so where is he and who is he and who do you say he is praise god amen you know what's happened we've come right back to matthew 16 again who do you who do you say the son of man is well some say this and some say that and it was malachi 4 and it was revelations 10 7 and that's a yeah yeah some say this and some say that the question is who do you say this is who do you say the son of man is further in the anointed ones at the end time he says the true vine and the false vine both had the same anointing holy ghost anointing the true vine and the false vine both had the same anointing the water fell on both of them no wonder he warned us it would deceive the very leg if it was possible notice they look the same they're anointed the same but notice by their fruit how do you know it now i want to lock down on this because the minute we start talking by their fruit how do you know you start thinking god in this gentleness peace long suffering temperance is that right by their fruits the fruit of the spirit the fruits of christ but brother brennan is not going to point to those fruits to notice the false vine he will not point to any of those fruits because the false vine have all those fruits so brother early in his ministry he used to say now the the the evidence of the holy ghost he knows it's not tongues but he doesn't know yet what it is to the evidence of the holy ghost it's got to be the fruits of the spirit yeah you get all those fruits of the spirit then he recognized no those can all be copied the false vine has the same fruits as the true vine that's why brother men will go in talking about you know your kind old priest you know he took care of you when you were sick he gave you money when you had when dad was out of work and he dedicated the babies he's been there all the time it means he's got character amen brother bannon even he he starts talking about makaya mikaya and zedekiah when they come before jehoshaphat and ahab and they asked mikaya mikaya is there anything wrong with zedekiah nope you ever seen him tell a lie no you ever see any problem no is his degree good yep is he a prophet of god yep is he a jewish prophet yes does he tell the truth yes is there anything wrong with his character nope can't put a light a finger on his life so you can't rely on those fruits well then you can go well the fruits let's go to manifestations you know we got speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues and laying on of hands and healing because because mark 16 said this will go with all the believers and it's absolutely the truth it should be present in the church of god there should be laying on of hands there should be tongues it should be in the church of the living god but the false vine can have all of the same manifestations so we can't look at that fruit so but by your fruit you'll know them well i can't look at manifestations and i can't look at fruits of the spirit or character or conduct or behavior what fruit can i look at to separate the true and false vine let's let the prophet of god tell us now you know that isn't an orange because it's bearing a grapefruit that vine is all right it's living in the tree but it's bearing a grapefruit it isn't like the first one and if the church says that they believed jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and deny his power deny his works deny his word the church that believes in jesus christ will do the works of jesus christ it'll it'll have the life of jesus christ and if it isn't no matter if the life is pouring into it if it isn't predestinated from the roots it'll bear grapefruit every time or something different but if it if it's the predestinated life in the roots it'll bear jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if it's the word coming up through the root which he is the root the beginning of time now i'm going to go on down and see what brother branham calls this fruit he makes it super clear but he says if it's predestinated life in the roots it'll bear jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and i want to spend some time thinking about that jesus christ yesterday today and forever so we're going to take out jesus christ and spread him over the bible yesterday today and forever now how would you recognize true and false vine through the whole bible because the true vine is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you can't necessarily do it by conduct because david sinned with bathsheba and had riot killed you can't just do it by fruits because they were all manifesting the same fruit and some had bad fruit and good fruit and the righteous eats them had bad fruit and abimelech had no unrighteousness but what was the separating factor through the entire scriptures being able to receive the word for your day through the entire bible the separating from the true and false vine through the holy and it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so it's got to be the same measuring stick the same separating principle that has to work through the whole scriptures it's got to work here at the end time the same as it did all the way back in the beginning and is separated by being able to receive the word of god for your day it's simple when we back up and look at it some people want to say well this means that and this means that amen but you know brother bem said it can all be replicated if it can be replicated amen if it can be if it can be copied amen then that's not it he says he goes on to say notice but it's what they produce that tells you the difference by their fruit jesus said you shall know them man does not gather grapes of a thistle even though a thistle may be right in the grapevine that that could be that could be possible but the fruit will tell it what is the fruit are you ready what is the fruit the word for the fruit for the season that's what it is their teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the season what time it is so what is their fruit their fruit is their teaching amen the teaching of the season is the is the true vine amen the teaching of the wrong season is the false vine it's the teaching of what the teaching of the season what time it is man's doctrine denominational doctrine or god's word for the season so the separating line brother brennan is bringing to us is the same separating line that we've had through the entire word of god amen it's the teaching being able to accept the word of god for our day amen and teach the word of god for our day the word in its season in that being taught is the fruit because they'll be the same kindness the same temperance amen the same brotherly love the same do you understand and the same healing and the same tongues and the same dreams that's why people in the past have gotten confused because they'll see an uptick in manifestations in the pentecostal church and prophecies and things like that in the in the church nominal the pentecostal church in this day and they get confused and don't get confused that's a genuine holy ghost on a genuine gift but brother banh says false vessel because of the teaching that the it goes to balaam and he says you know you go to balaam balaam amen it was brother says he goes over to jude i think in the book of revelation he said it was the teaching of balaam not the prophecy of balaam the prophecy of balaam was true the teaching of balaam was false so under the spirit and brother bam said he was a true prophet he was born that way he had the gift of a prophet amen and under that gift he had the brother bear said the same anointing that moses had and under the same anointing that moses had amen he catches the true prophecy and when he goes to curse israel because he's a genuine prophet with the genuine holy ghost he cannot under that anointing curse them all he can do is say you thou art a unicorn how lovely are thy tents and those that bless you will be blessed amen he pours out a blessing and a recognition of how god sees them remember balak had taken him up to the backside so he could see all the wickedness and the pollution in the dirt and the filth and the worst of the works that they had to offer and he looked at that he thought that'd be a suitable place to curse and when he goes to curse because he's got a true gift by the true spirit of god the same one moses had now what he starts doing is he starts speaking how god sees the backside of israel i don't care what the devil tells you i don't care what some false teacher has tried to tell you amen under a true anointing a false vessel under a true anointing can only say what god says and god didn't have anything evil to speak about that camp that day and there was evil there brother benham said just cause for cursing and all god could give us a blessing and balaam under the same anointing with the same gift brought forth a true prophecy and there was nothing wrong with this prophecy the problem was with his teaching his teaching that we're all the same that we can join in together in worship and fellowship it wasn't his prophecy it was his teaching it's not the tongues it's not the healings it's not the miracles it's not the dreams it's not the prophecies they're not wrong so when you see something happen in an uptick in the pentecostal root and you start seeing gifts and you're like look what they've got they've got what we don't have i dare say not don't you dare say something like that because we've got something they could never have we've got the word for this day and a faith in our heart to believe it and receive it amen and all of those gifts are present but they're under control why because god's highest form of communicating with man is the preaching of the word and if god can communicate through the preaching of the word he does not need to use every gift that's out there all the time because his highest form is the preaching of the word [Music] but every gift is present rest assured every gift is present amen just because you see this pop up in this what is it it's the latter rain they're under the latter rain brother member says the rain falls on the scripture the rain falls on the just and the unjust and brother brown said it's the former and latter rain the former rain was the teaching rain remember when it comes to the opening of the seals it was the latter rain or the harvest rain the rain that would fall to bring every seed into full maturity whether it's true or false where the tweet or thistle so what's happening they're under the latter rain and under the latter rain the gifts can operate don't let that confuse you that's not the fruit the gift is fine the teaching is false teaching trinitarianism teaching armenianism that every time you fail you got to come to the altar you got to start all over again you got to get re-baptized amen teaching that you know you can be lost when if you're a predestination of god you can't be lost so the the anointing is right the gift is right the manifestation is right but the teaching is wrong i hope that helps don't get confused by what we see i've had people tell me before the pentecostals are doing more than us no way no way what are you looking for are you looking for a manifestation are you looking for the word what are you focused on are you looking for the son of man who do you say the son of man thou art christ the son of the living god k ephesus was prophesying and didn't have that peter was running scared for his life but he had something k ephesus would never have i'd rather take peter's portion than k ephesus give me the word above everything else give me the word give me the word with the revelation the word for this hour above everything else that you can get give me that word because with the word comes everything the fullness every gift every manifestation every power in fact the revealed word is the power praise god let's get into matthew chapter 7. matthew chapter 7 verse 15. beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth forth not good not forth good fruit is shown down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruit you shall know them now we know the difference between an evil fruit and a good fruit right because the evil fruit is the wrong teaching on the word the good fruit is the revelation of the hour that's what the prophet of god told us so now we don't have to be confused about scriptures like this it says not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and his will is his word how do i know to do the will of god it's his word his will is his word he's given us his word this day he's given us his will and when we receive that in its full measure and live it with all that's in us amen we're doing the will of the father it's not him that saith lord lord that will enter in but he that doeth the will of my father and you cannot do the will without receiving the word many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have we cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity the iniquity was not casting out devils the indiquity was not the miracles the signs and the wonders that was not the iniquity the iniquity was to know to do good and refuse to do it to not do the will of the father to not baptize in jesus name though you can see it in the scriptures to not dress in modest apparel though you can see in the scriptures and not teach the people to do that amen that is not doing the will of the father because you're not keeping the word amen you're teaching the wrong doctrine now you're found with iniquity no matter how many miracles healings and whatever has happened amen that's not the iniquity the iniquity is not keeping the word praise be to god that's why the brother bear said the bride will have the word and the word alone that doesn't mean there won't be manifestations with it but that's not her security my security is not in the things that made judas feel secure judas comes back with the the disciples who went out two by two and they start declaring oh i mean we healed the sick and i mean we did many many things and the devils were subject into us he said don't rejoice in that the devils are subject unto you rejoice that your names are written in [Music] heaven i don't my security i don't want my security to be the same thing that made caiaphas feel secure or made judas feel secure or any of these people in matthew chapter 7 that come and said lord lord you realize this group when they called him lord lord they knew who he was this is a familiar term of lord lord with emphasis upon it and they say lord and i've mentioned this many many many times but i'm going to reinforce it here they're standing at the white throne judgment they are not lying to god they are not trying to pull the wool over his eyes they are being honest when he says when we have are we not prophesied in thy name they did it we're not cast out devils in thy name they did it and done many wonderful works they did it and apparently if they can stand at the white throne judgment and make that their defense they have a false sense of security that the fact they could prophesy cast out devils and do many mighty works would make them fit to enter into the kingdom of heaven and but god saw them unfit although the works were fine amen the iniquity was not keeping the word brother branham said you minister sit in your study and you read that faith and you turn the page quick to not have to deal with it that's this group right here so let our security be in the revelation of the word our security is so rich because it's a divine revelation it's not a put on it's not a pretend you can't make yourself not believe it's not a trying or straining i'm working my way to i just believe it it's a it's something that god has done in my heart something that was given to me it's not something i worked up to read enough labored enough i just receive it as it is i believe this gospel and abel was so secure in his revelation that he didn't fight back when cain fought him and he was willing to lay down his life no greater love has any man than to lay down his life for a friend and abel surrendered himself under the revelation of the world word and he didn't fight back against king that's real security in your revelation but when you've got to lash out and strike out and fight and prove you're right where's the security at where's our confidence in the word that we believe why not just say i don't know i just believe it you don't see it that's okay i mean that's fine with me i'm not upset i don't think abel was angry at kane because cain couldn't see what abel was telling him i don't think that's the nature that he had he may have felt sorry he may have been grieved but i don't think he was angry but somehow it made cain angry to have a difference the difference in revelation the difference in understanding made cain angry but i don't think it made abel angry and abel was able abel was able abel was able to not fight back i want to get to that place where i'm so secure in christ like the apostle paul if they throw rocks at your head they throw rocks at your head what could he do about it they beat you on the back they beat you in the back what did he do he was so secure he was so confident that what he had was the word of god when they left him for dead outside the city the disciples gathered around and he come back to life and you find him in the next city preaching again that's a man who's thoroughly convinced that what he's got is the goods and what he had he was so convinced in what he had that when god allowed the circumstances to turn negative and evil and he was beaten for what he said he didn't throw away what he what he taught you understand he was confident that this was jesus christ that this was the word he'd go right back and teach it again he'd go right back and say it over he'd go right back and preach the same sermon he got stoned for he preached it again why because he knew it was the truth that's a man who was confident he wasn't willing under the first sign of pressure to run away like marcus did in their first journey marcus hightailed at home he eventually repented they were restored but at the first when that pressure come he hightailed at home paul had nowhere else to go he was standing on the word he had the word he had a commission he had nothing else he was so convinced he was willing to give his life for it i want to be that kind of confident these people in matthew chapter 7 standing before almighty god at the white throne judgment have a false sense of security and have staked their salvation on the wrong thing they have put their salvation their defense at the white throne judgment they have based it on their works and their manifestations of the spirit and i want to say true manifestations of the true spirit i wonder i wonder if we could stand at the white throne judgment and you yourself be there who really lived a simple basic christian life really there wasn't a lot of hoopla about your life there wasn't tons of supernatural you had some supernatural things that happened you had god do some special things in your life but really you never had a public display of that it was really private in your life private in your home and and you had god show up on the scene you had manifestations of gifts in your life but really it was never public it was never broadcast many people didn't know and you sit there and your confidence was never in the fact that god answered your prayer because if your confidence is in the fact that god answered your prayer when he decides not to answer your prayer where did your confidence go and if your confidence is in the fact that you lay hands on somebody and they're healed what happens if they lay hands on somebody and they die where did your confidence go but can you imagine sitting there you're the bride you're not in the white throne gender you're just sitting there you're you're on the throne with christ you didn't have a flashy life you didn't have a lot of things you could point to and one by one these great men of the age come the pentecostal age raising the dead and healing the sick and and one by one they're refused and banished out of darkness what was the separating line what was the dividing line it was you were able by the grace of god to receive the word for your day you were able to receive the son of man you were able to accept that this is jesus christ the son of the living god and something in your heart cried out when others would say it's bogus or it's a charlatan or it's a false prophet something in your heart said it's none other than jesus christ the son of god brother ben says again an anointed ones at the end time he said oh america how of god would have hovered you but now your hours come you lead the world in filth blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affections no true love even for one another man to woman woman to man not even natural affection filthy sexually truth fakers false accusers incontinent fierce and despises those that are good in other words say you bunch of holy rollers someone asked the other day about coming up here to the church said don't go up there all it is is a bunch of noise and carrying on see despisers of those traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god you say brother brenham that's communist what's the next verse say having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof now brother injects a statement in here in parent they put it in parentheses so i'm going to finish this sentence and i'm going to show you what he emphasized having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof the word having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof what's the power of that it's the word you have a form of godliness god-likeness amen but when you reject the word you reject god amen you reject the power of godliness because the power of godliness is based on the revelation of the word because the word was with god the word was god amen brother brahma said the god is the word having a form of guidance but denying the power thereof the word jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever manifested the promise for the day just exactly like han and i just exactly like zedeki just exactly like balaam on back other false prophets having a form of godliness anointed see having reform anointed and ordained ministers having a form of godliness but denying that he's the same yesterday today denying his word so if you deny the power thereof having a form regardless but denying the power thereof the pentecostals will teach that you're denying the manifestation of the gifts that's not what brother benham said when you deny the power thereof you're denying jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the word made manifest in your day that's the power thereof denying that he's the same yesterday today denying his word how did they deny jesus in that day who did they deny when they denied jesus the word who were they denying the word when they denied him they denied god they were religious they taught from their bible but denied the present day word amen they were religious they were bible scholars they were bible teachers they were religious they were teaching out of the bible the same bible jesus was quoting from was the same one they were reading from and jesus was quoting scriptures to show who he was and they were quoting scriptures to deny who he was come out of the same bible they taught from their bible but denied the present day word what are they today same thing anointed preaching the gospel of pentecost but denying the present day promise of the word being vindicated jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever do you see it the man was going to say moses said now the lord god will speak to me and show me and has told me what to do and i'll tell you said i am sent me god told him to say i who should i say send me they're going to ask me your name that i met you that you have a name what's your name say tell them i am sent you because if you want to know god you have to know him as the i am you cannot know god as the i was or that i will be but the only way to know god today is to know him as the i am i am sent me i am not i was or will be i am present tense the word now not the word that was or the word that will come the word that's now you get it i am i am is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god is that right i am i want god if you want god you contact him as the i am the word made manifest it says there is one genuine christ spirit there is one genuine christ remember we're talking about jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever there is one genuine christ spirit that's the word made flesh as he promised to do it think on that there's one genuine christ spirit that's the word made flesh but he's the same yesterday today and forever so brother brennan's not talking about 33 years that was 2000 years ago he's talking about the word made flesh what's that that's the genuine christ spirit let's go to hebrews 11. hebrews 11 and 24. by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of refuse to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ you tell me christ was all the way back in the book of genesis moses made a choice and his choice was to bear the reproach of christ because it's jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever the same jesus christ we're accepting today is the same jesus christ moses was accepting and bearing his reproach it is the word the word the word the word he says back in anointing once at the end time it's the grain of wheat itself the son of man will be made manifest the grain of wheat will come back to itself again the son of man in the last day he says the reason the elected jesus said won't be deceived because they are that word i'm going to put these two things together let's go back and read it it's the grain of wheat itself the son of man will be made manifest the grain of wheat will come back to itself again the son of man in the last days so we're coming back to the son of man again in the last days the grain of wheat is coming back to itself in the last days and then he says the reason the elect the elected jesus said won't be deceived because they are that word they can't be nothing else they can't hear nothing else they don't know nothing else that's right so what word are they if they are the word if the bridegroom was a word what will the bride be the word if eve amen if the woman was actually taken out of the man and god looked down at man and woman and called her adam she was adam and you understand that i mean she was adam she was the same thing whatever adam was she was whatever adam was made out of she was made out of whatever spirit was in her was the spirit that was in adam so she was him one the woman before she got her name eve because eve is the name of blasphemy it's a name of adultery so she got her name after she fell not before so as the woman woman is title woman isn't name she had a name she had a god-given name and her name was adam because she was him they were two of the same thing male and female of the same thing the same substance the same spirit the same life so now if he's coming back to grain again he's coming back to itself the grain again that's the word and she's coming to her position which is the word and the and christ coming back as the son of man is the word for our day the bride coming her position is the word for our day are you getting it not two words for our day one word for our day not two manifestations in our day one manifestation in our day when he comes back to the grain and she becomes the word then you're uniting signs and times she is the word she is the grain that's why brother bram said see tussle i mean blade tossled shut grain blade tossled shut gray he teaches it over and over and over again now he tells us jesus the son of man is coming back to grain back to itself again how will it come back to itself again he's been coming back through the church ages and finally he comes back to the grain the original word there's can i find faith when the son of man comes will he find faith what faith the original faith in the original word back to grain again when the flesh becomes the word and the word is becoming flesh see the elected jesus said won't be to see because they are that word let's look at john 12. the gospel of john chapter 12. remember my question and don't forget it who do you say this son of man is not that son of man i think the dispensation previous to us in the forerunner is clear but i'm asking today who do you say this son of man is because there has to be a ministry the son of man on earth john chapter 12 verse 21 the same came therefore to philip which was the theta sorry of galilean desired him saying sir we would see jesus philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answered them saying now i want you to focus on the question the greeks which are gentiles not jews gentiles they're coming and they're asking a question and they're saying we want to see jesus so now you got to you got to know the question and who's asking the question to make sense of the response and jesus answered them and saying the hours come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die and abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit what did he just do he just answered their question you're gentiles this isn't the form i come to the gentiles in they say we would see jesus it wasn't time when it was now time for the gentiles to come seeking jesus he says well it's time for the son of man to be glorified i got to get off the scene because the gentiles are looking for me and they will not find me in this manifestation it's time for me to go but tell them if a corner wheat fall into a ground and die unless it for the fallen ground and die of bite of the alone but if it die amen it'll come forth what will it come forth one will come forth many the bridegroom will come down and come up the bride it'll go down one's grain of wheat it'll come back and ahead a multiple grains of wheat so how will the greek see jesus not as the singular grain but in the head when it comes back to a body a bride body of jesus christ that's when the greeks will see him we would see jesus uh-oh it's time for the son of man to be glorified i'm not going to show myself in this form to the greeks but if i don't go in the ground and die i'll buy it alone but if i go into the ground and die we'll bring forth much fruit if you want to see me look for the grain again who do you say the son of man is and the message the unveiling of god brother says now to the perfect after the stalk has been formed after the toss has been formed after the grain has come into the cob then it has to come to perfection back to the regular grain again you notice he's talking about the church ages he's referring to church ages and he's talking about jesus coming back to the grain but he's talking about the church ages so i hope you can see it's the same thing remember the grain must be germatized if it don't it won't live none of that was outside of the messengers will ever come to life it has to be germanized to it but remember the same life that was in the stalk is in the grain it's just maturing itself right back see he revealed himself what son of man the grain that went into the ground get the message brother did you get it he he the it's been the same life through the stalk through the torso through the stalk and remember it's coming back to maturity back to grain again back to the same grain that went in the ground it's just maturing itself right back see he revealed himself what the son of man the grain that went into the ground so when he reveals himself as son of man again it'll be grain time harvest time maturity time the greek said to him we would see jesus he said except the corner except the corn falls into the ground see all right now what did he reveal himself next in a different form stalk and tossle and so forth i'm not just making this up friends brother branham is telling us what those church ages were it was building back a body for jesus christ he revealed himself then same spirit but in a different form but that's the lat but what's the last of the corn it comes back to the grain again is that right and his ministry comes from them reformations back to the original word again the word comes to a prophet and he promised in malachi 4 and to restore the faith of the people back to the original grain what went in the ground is hear the same do you catch that amen jesus said unless a corner of wheat fallen to the ground he went to the ground and died he said what was back there is here the same the grain has come up through here it come up as a son of god when he says it come up as the son of god he's talking about the seven church ages it was son of man son of god through the church ages back to this little sliver of son of man before son of david sets up his earthly kingdom in the millennium so now he's talking about this is grain here but this grain's got to go into the ground and die through the church age it's got to be restored back but it's got to come back to grain again when it's grain again it's the same thing that went down son of man son of man went down it was the son of god through the restoration process the building of the body but when it's capped off at son of man again who do you say the son of man is see he says back to the original grain what went in the ground is here the same the grain has come up through here it come up as a son of god now now it reveals itself here as son of man and then it reveals itself as son of david on the throne see them three sons just exactly oh my again like the original not to the to the perfect ministry of himself not some man not some denomination as they've worked down through the age there but himself made manifest manifest himself to the promise making saint luke 17 28 malachi 4 and so forth hebrews 13 8 just exactly right at that time what time should it be when the royal seed of abraham is looking for the promised son and all types must be fulfilled and god himself appeared in the form of a human being to abraham's natural seed before the destruction and jesus said it would be the same thing to the royal seed before the promised son returns we've come right through that cycle we've had three angels that come amen we've had two that goes down into sodom brother of them said oral roberts and billy graham but one stayed up here with this elected called out group and what was that it was god working in a body of flesh brotherhood said it's not me who does this he said i can't tell you what's wrong with you it's not me it's god then we come to the invisible union of the bride of christ he says but remember when it went down and the grain began to ripen you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead so for the grain to ripen the church ages have to die all of them have to die so the life moves into the grain hallelujah can't you see where we're standing if everything in that stalk has to die and the shuck then can't you see where we're standing we're standing past the shock back in the grain that's the only place the life can be what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus in bride form what have we been talking about what went in the ground the grain what's coming back at the end of the ages the grain when the greeks looked for him he was singular but he couldn't show himself to the greeks that way he says unless a corner we fall into the ground i abide alone but if it falls on the ground diet brings forth much fruit when after he's done with the son of god dispensation amen and all the life leaves that all the life moves into the grain which is the bride amen the same life that went down comes back up again the same everything the same he's this is what he says the same jesus in bride form why did they miss him when he come to the jews because he came in an unexpected way to their theology why did they miss him in this day because he came in an unexpected way to their theology but it is now back to the grain it is now harvest time it is the it is the the former rain has come the latter rain has come the harvest is on he's cleaning and pulling out his harvest because it's back to the grain again that's what harvest is that's what adoption age is that's what bride age is it's all the same thing it's the harvest of the wheat i want to read that again life is in the grain again brother branham is not saying it will be the life is in the grain again which means it is not in any previous dispensation and it was proved by god taking a wave sheep and plucking up a piece of this field which is bright age field which is church field amen pulled it up out of the bride and he waved it before the people it was the first part of the word to come to harvest maturity it wasn't the man it was the word that was inside the man had come to maturity to display jesus christ back in flesh again and it was waved over the people showing the whole harvest that the whole field that we are at harvest time now the life is in the grain amen and whatever happened to that is happening to me not another age not another dispensation not another time but the time is on that's what the wave sheath marks the time is on this is harvest time now we know where the life is it's in the grain what is the grain it's jesus in bride form i love the fact that he didn't say christ because if he had said christ people would take this quote and they'd shove it into a different category and they'd make it a son of god text but this is the son of man text jesus same jesus in the bright form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all that life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the rapture it's the same jesus in bright form who do you say the son of man is well you know it's the spirit of god it's a spiritual manner brother graham said it's jesus and bride form and it can't be accepted because he comes in an unexpected way to our theology oh if there's any believers in ephesus listen to me today it's jesus in brideform it's the coming of the son of man came at the revealing of the son of man those events happen together amen this is grain time this is harvest time we're not looking for the harvest we're in the harvest we're not looking for the rapture this is the rapture the rapture is ongoing now gathering all the wheat together and when he gets it all together amen he's going to carry it away this is the harvest this is the rapture this is the grain this is the son of man this is christ jesus in bright form back in the anointed ones at the end time he says the anointed ones jesus said they're teaching for doctrine the interpretation of the scriptures of man see not the word of god not his vindicated word teaching a historical christ see something that was when moses introduced god to them he had to introduce him as i am it's got to be i am teaching a historical christ something that was and the bible said he is i am not i was or will be i am right now he's the word that lives through there he was in the beginning he was in the blades he was in the tassel he was in the shock but now he's in the grain no questions anointing ones at the end time again he says in the very day that the son of man is revealed revelation 10 1-7 okay that's when he's revealed the opening of the seals revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh angel's message open up those seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seemed to be so hard for you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left to shock it can't organize it's the grain itself again he has already come back to the grain that's the bride age that's what the bride is supposed to be is the grain his very life jesus in bright form brother brown said at the end of anointed ones i wasn't the one appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things foretells these things that happen so perfect they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it i wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that i spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god i'd like to say it this way it's not you it's god you can say the same thing brother bam could say it's not me it's not me none of myself it's not my works or my ability it's not i'm living a nice life and i'm a nice person it's not me amen it's god inside of me god moving me in ways that i couldn't move before god bringing me into manifestations in places and faith that i never knew i had it's not me it's god god's doing the work he said the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he's the one that you're feeding on you know you are what you eat if you eat the son of man you become you fill in the blanks the son of man's christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man when the son of man came the first time it was the full measure of the word on full display in a vessel and when the son of man comes in this time it's a full measure of the word on a full display in a many-membered vessel that's what he's desiring to do today friends and he wants to take your vessel and my vessel and he wants to manifest himself through us how by what fruit what will be the fruits of that it could be anything that's in the word but it will never be contrary to this word the fruit will be receiving the word for your day manifesting the word for your day being the bride things that are to be now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride the manifestation of this are the manifestation of the word for this day i ask you who do you say this is who do you say the son of man is because it is the son of man and grain again in bride form the question is who do you say this is that's a group of people with funny ideas and these ones believe this way and these ones believe this way or can you say that is christ the son of the living god this is none other than jesus christ working among his people you realize to come back to grain again does not mean to deliver a message to the people to put it on books and tapes and have the message in their pocket that was not the purpose of the son of man ministry that was not the purpose of the message so but so many times we've got the wrong idea we think of the message as the words on tape we think of the message as the books and the tapes and i've got the message and i've got this sd chip and i've got all the message you could have that sd chip and have none of the message because the message is christ it's back to grain again it's jesus christ it's jesus in bright form that's the message now you get it now you got it it's the very life of god it's the word that has come back been restored to the original faith back to the original word now that word is abiding in a people and living in flesh that's the son of man when the son of man was here before it was the word made manifest in human flesh and the son of man today is the word made manifest in human flesh the message is not what you have in your pocket the message is not what you have in your book amen the message is christ jesus in bride form the son of man the grain that went into the ground and died has come back in much fruit and that is christ the son of man christ the son of the living god but he's come in a form that wasn't expected and a plumber and a carpenter and a businessman and an accountant and a housewife and a store clerk and i didn't expect that to be the son of man like i can see it in brother branham there's the son of man i see that i'm telling you if you leave it there you're the same place that believers were in ephesus you're preaching the same thing apollos preached not a bad man a good man a lovely man a seed of god but he had to know the way of life more perfectly amen that's the son of man no that was the son of man that was the revealing of the son of man that was the coming of the son of man that was the testimony to the royal seed like on the plains of memory but that testimony changed the bride to receive the seed to bring forth the word because that's what happened to sarah because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour what is the fruit brother brahm told us to look for the teaching the doc the the the miracles of janice and jeremy were fine the prophecy of balaam was fine it was the teaching that was false teaching that were in that that there's some other manifestation for this day because what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living who do you say this is it's none other than jesus christ the son of the living god but it's come in an unexpected way yeah when i was a little kid i didn't expect it peter didn't expect it paul didn't expect it but god knew brother branham didn't expect it but god knew jehovah jiren 1964 just believe just have faith now don't no one move around just sit real rev i want you to imagine standing before you and here somewhere christ this is what brother bran now let's just put ourselves in his words don't move around be real reverent i want you to imagine standing before you in here somewhere christ raised up from the dead come right through the walls one time eat bread feel me on flesh and bones and disappeared right before them now brother was telling them to get a mental image of jesus christ standing here like he walked through on the disciples one day he said now he promised that he would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh again he did that brother branham i agree but can i read the quote he promised that he would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh again in your flesh like he did at the days of sodom god which was christ manifest in the flesh now in his church his bride see they're coming together it's uniting time churches are uniting nations are uniting and the bride in christ is uniting back to the grain itself again back to the original word when i come on the earth when the son of man comes will he find faith and the answer is yes because there's a bride that was here to receive it when he came that question has been answered brother bam said will malachi 4 be fulfilled a restoration back to the order of faith the answer is yes because god saw to it that there was a predestinated people with something inside of them that could receive that word and say that's my lord that's nothing but the truth he promised oh i just love this quote that he would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh again in your flesh back to the grain what he told the greeks was a prophecy of our day and we're the manifestation of that prophecy that's why jesus promised we would be here today let's turn to colossians musicians you can come if you'd like blake if you'd like to come colossians chapter 1 verse 26. colossians 1 26 even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory the same thing jesus said to the greeks now paul lays down the prophecy in the great mystery but now we're at the days of the fulfilling of this word and the fruit that janice and jemerys brought forth were not believing the word resisting the truth and reprobates concerning the faith balaam brought forth a true prophecy with a true gift under a true anointing but he had a false teaching but now we've been taught by the prophet himself that this is grain time this is jesus in the form of the bride this is the son of man the grain returned back to a head again at the end of the church ages when everything else has died brought up to a bright age to the harvest time and now jesus christ wants to be displayed the manifested word today is the bride that's where we're at that's who we are not by merit not by choice but by predestination and he's not looking for efforts and he's not looking for skills he's looking for someone that will humble themselves and allow him to have the preeminence so that he can show that the grain is in your flesh amen it's not going to be you you've got to say just like brother ben i wasn't the one who came in the river that day i wasn't the one who said those things i wasn't the one who knew what was sick with you and i'm not the one who healed you brother versus you didn't touch me he you touched him i'm just a man i could do nothing for you in my flesh it's not me it's not my flesh it's not the birth of parents amen you realize it's god who predestinated me to this position before the foundation of the world i'm his bride and the manifestation of the word for this day because he said so and now the only thing i can do is just humble myself die to myself and surrender to that being true and let him have his way stay humble stay submissive stay dead but now it's back to the grain again the son of man is here he's promised to return appear at the end time in human flesh in your flesh don't deny it don't fear it don't push it away just say lord i believe it lord i believe it now help me god let's all stand [Music] [Music] is life comes where the two drops shines all around jesus one more time such a beautiful
