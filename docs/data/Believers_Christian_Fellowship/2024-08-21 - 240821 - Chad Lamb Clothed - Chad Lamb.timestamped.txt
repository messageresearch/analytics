[2:55] put a song in my soul today a song of
[3:01] Praise
[3:04] hallelujah amen to pardon me for being
[3:07] just a little bit cheerful tonight I was
[3:11] I told Jill on the way to church you can
[3:12] just play something softly I sing that
[3:15] something keeps holding
[3:16] me and I was on the way to church and
[3:19] she'd got some things out for supper and
[3:22] and I was eating just a pepper you know
[3:23] one of those little Peppers that you
[3:24] munch on and I was eating on it and I
[3:27] opened it up and there was no seeds on
[3:29] the inside side and I looked at it and I
[3:32] thought oh it's kind of like seedless
[3:34] watermelon and I was like they're just
[3:36] doing it and then you know just the
[3:39] words of eternal life just begin to play
[3:41] in my heart and I thought you know
[3:43] that's what I was that's what this is
[3:47] amen no way to bring forth life just
[3:51] looks good the pepper says I'm a pepper
[3:53] I look like a pepper I taste like a
[3:55] pepper but if you put it in the ground
[3:56] it can't bring forth eternal life and
[3:59] I'm so thankful that he saw me before
[4:02] the foundation of the world and he put a
[4:03] seed in there that had nothing to do
[4:04] with that old pepper skin on the outside
[4:07] but he put a seed that's going to bring
[4:08] forth one of these days and it just it
[4:10] just cheered my heart so I hope that
[4:12] wasn't maybe too out of the way for
[4:14] tonight but I'm so thankful that God
[4:16] just shows himself in those simple
[4:18] things you know just preparing for
[4:19] church and I said Thank you Lord for the
[4:22] seed that you put on the inside that
[4:24] there's no seed there that's going to
[4:25] reproduce life except for your seed amen

[15:49] amen man God bless you man it's good to
[15:52] be here today tonight good to be back in
[15:55] the pull pit again it's been a a couple
[15:57] weeks for me amen and so I don't maybe I
[16:00] forgot how already brother BM said it's
[16:01] something you have to stick with so you
[16:03] got to stick with it so you don't forget
[16:05] let's turn with uh together in our
[16:07] Bibles to Isaiah 1 and as you turn I
[16:10] want to let you know that brother
[16:11] Benjamin seabolt's going to be traveling
[16:12] to Michigan to minister for brother Dan
[16:15] Ratliff this weekend so please remember
[16:17] him in prayer and as brother John
[16:19] mentioned uh just keep brother Emanuel
[16:21] and brother Bley Williams in your
[16:22] prayers as well and uh we should hear
[16:26] back from them here pretty soon I think
[16:28] they've got a another week just about
[16:30] another week to go unless they extended
[16:33] I haven't heard word yet that they're
[16:34] extending it so that's as far as I know
[16:37] also want to let you know that I know
[16:38] school's back in session and I'm mindful
[16:40] of that so I don't intend to go long on
[16:42] Wednesday night I know those little guys
[16:45] pretty tired and they got to get up
[16:46] early so just pull hard and
[16:49] fast hard and fast and then we'll see
[16:52] the way the Lord leads Isaiah uh
[16:57] 1:8 come now and let us reason together
[17:00] sayeth the Lord though your sins be as
[17:02] Scarlet they shall be as white as snow
[17:05] though they be red like Crimson they
[17:07] shall be as wool man God bless you may
[17:10] may have your
[17:14] seats like this scripture we we've known
[17:17] it for quite some time but the Lord is
[17:20] saying let us reason together sayith the
[17:23] Lord though your sins be as
[17:25] Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[17:27] though they be red like Crimson they
[17:29] shall be as wool meaning that your your
[17:32] sins are going to be changed they're
[17:34] going to be converted from Crimson from
[17:36] red to White from Crimson to wool amen
[17:39] and there's a prophecy that's a promise
[17:41] that God is making and brother R when he
[17:44] refers to this scripture many times and
[17:47] he refers to it in this manner I'm going
[17:48] to read a quote to you from
[17:50] 1956 and many times he takes that
[17:52] scripture and he goes to this uh
[17:55] comparison and the message fellowship
[17:57] with God through reconciliation
[17:59] says and let me give you a little bit of
[18:01] scientific something you can take a red
[18:04] purely genuine red glass and look
[18:06] through it at a red object and red
[18:08] through red looks white figure it out
[18:11] God looking through the blood of Christ
[18:13] to a red sinner is white as snow though
[18:16] your sins be red like Crimson they shall
[18:19] be white like snow so the way brother R
[18:21] takes and interprets this scripture is
[18:24] he begins to show us that though your
[18:26] sins be red they shall be white as snow
[18:29] though they be like Crimson they shall
[18:31] be like wool and he's and he's telling
[18:33] us that it's not as though that the sin
[18:36] is going to be turned white but the sin
[18:38] is going to be covered with blood amen
[18:40] and red through red is
[18:43] white amen that's how brother R explains
[18:46] this many times several places in the
[18:48] message he goes on in the same quote he
[18:50] says God knew what he was doing when he
[18:52] looked through the blood of the innocent
[18:54] to the guilty that's bloody red and he
[18:56] sees him white not because he's
[18:59] righteous but because he's accepted the
[19:01] righteousness of God through
[19:03] Christ oh just let that soak in not
[19:06] because he's white not because he's
[19:08] become white amen we were born in sin
[19:11] shape and iniquity come into the world
[19:12] speaking Lies We were perverted from the
[19:14] beginning amen and and we come with a
[19:17] sinful nature we come in the wrong way
[19:19] amen but God Amen when he looks through
[19:22] the blood of the Lamb amen and he sees
[19:24] our Crimson spotted stains they're white
[19:26] as snow
[19:28] and so I want to read that again
[19:32] uh because it's important to the rest of
[19:34] what I want to say so I'm just going to
[19:35] repeat here God knew what he was doing
[19:38] when he looked through the blood of the
[19:40] innocent to the guilty that's bloody red
[19:43] and he sees him white not because he's
[19:46] righteous but because he's accepted the
[19:49] righteousness of God through Christ and
[19:51] become reconciled back to fellowship
[19:53] again with God not because something
[19:55] that you do some good deeds that's all
[19:57] right you do The Good Deeds because
[19:59] you're a Believer but that doesn't do it
[20:01] by Good Deeds joining church is all
[20:03] right but that isn't what does it it's
[20:06] when you recognize that you're a sinner
[20:07] lost and the only way that God can see
[20:09] you righteous is through the blood of
[20:11] Jesus Christ then when he sees you
[20:13] through the blood of Jesus he sees you
[20:16] as innocent as his own son Christ Jesus
[20:19] was that's the gospel story
[20:22] friend Simplicity that's the gospel
[20:25] story not that through Good Deeds or
[20:28] through good conduct or through uh uh
[20:30] applying yourself harder or through some
[20:32] wisdom or intellect that you can somehow
[20:34] convert your scarlet colored stains into
[20:37] something Snow White that's an
[20:39] impossibility that the efforts of man
[20:41] cannot do this amen and he says now
[20:43] you're white not because of your
[20:45] righteousness but you've accepted the
[20:47] righteousness of God through Jesus
[20:49] Christ amen and now he's looking at you
[20:52] through the blood filter and through the
[20:53] blood filter he can't see your Crimson
[20:56] stains because red and red looks White
[20:58] to him this is the fundamental basis of
[21:02] the Gospel amen if you would turn with
[21:04] me to Genesis chap
[21:08] 2 I just was meditating and thinking and
[21:12] and and it was like a it so often
[21:14] happens I don't know that I can
[21:16] accurately describe it or even explain
[21:17] it and doing so might be foolish but
[21:20] it's almost like a lightning bolt from
[21:22] Heaven all of a sudden just a flash of
[21:24] inspiration and Revelation and and then
[21:27] all of a sudden things that you've known
[21:28] all your life blossom into something
[21:30] entirely more beautiful than you've
[21:32] already been looking at not something
[21:34] new something that's the same I've told
[21:37] several people over the last couple days
[21:39] that by the time you're 10 years old you
[21:41] know everything you need to know about
[21:42] the
[21:44] message you know the message the message
[21:47] is man fell in the beginning he left
[21:50] God's word and he perverted himself and
[21:51] he's been corrupt ever
[21:53] since and God gave him a law because man
[21:56] couldn't accept his grace and he found
[21:57] out that he was an utter failure and the
[21:59] law exposed how much of a failure he was
[22:01] so Christ came to be the innocent lamb
[22:03] to stand in the place of a of a sinner
[22:05] who could never make himself right no
[22:06] matter how hard he
[22:08] tried but then then the gospel to the
[22:11] Gentiles and the Gentiles ruined it by
[22:12] adding their own intellect and
[22:14] understanding to it but at the end time
[22:15] God was going to bring us back to the
[22:16] full revelation of the full word and
[22:18] restore a bride and marry a bride and
[22:20] take her to glory and bring us back to
[22:21] Eden that's the whole message
[22:23] Friends by the time you're 10 years old
[22:26] growing up in the message you know
[22:27] everything you need and you know the
[22:28] whole message you know it amen but but
[22:31] if you live to be a 100 and you add 10
[22:33] more decades to that 10y old amen you're
[22:36] never going to come to the end of
[22:37] discovering this message it's going to
[22:39] keep unfolding and keep growing and keep
[22:41] becoming more marvelous it's simple and
[22:44] deep it's it's it's it's easy and it's
[22:46] complex am it's
[22:49] beautiful
[22:51] beautiful so we're going to go back to
[22:53] the most simplest of
[22:54] stories and find that it's the whole
[22:57] gospel if we go to Genesis chap
[23:00] 2 and let's look at verse
[23:06] 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[23:08] to fall upon Adam and he slept and he
[23:11] took one of his ribs and closed up the
[23:13] flesh instead thereof and the rib which
[23:15] the Lord God had taken from man made he
[23:17] a woman and brought her unto the man and
[23:20] Adam said this is now bone of my bones
[23:22] and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[23:23] called woman because she was taken out
[23:26] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[23:28] father and his mother and shall cleave
[23:30] unto his wife and they shall be one
[23:33] flesh and they were both naked the man
[23:35] and his wife and were not
[23:38] ashamed man I would like just for a
[23:40] title just for a subject I would like to
[23:43] look at the title clothed the word
[23:45] clothed what does it mean to be
[23:48] clothed and we find here in the
[23:51] beginning that when God made man amen
[23:54] and he made him a help me he took from
[23:55] him and his wife and restored them back
[23:57] together and it says here very just very
[24:00] simply it says that uh they were both
[24:03] naked the man and his wife and were not
[24:05] ashamed so technically they were
[24:09] uncovered amen but the prophet of God
[24:11] tells us that they were covered that
[24:13] they were veiled they had a veil they
[24:15] had a covering although there was no
[24:18] covering there was a
[24:19] covering he says in Satan's eeden this
[24:22] way he said compare this now how much
[24:24] alike that man and his wife both in
[24:26] God's Eden without one stitch of clothes
[24:28] on them and knew it not for why did they
[24:31] know why didn't they know it for they
[24:33] were veiled to their senses of nakedness
[24:36] by the holy veil of the Holy Spirit they
[24:38] could look right at each other and they
[24:40] didn't know that they were naked they
[24:42] were veiled with the Holy Spirit of
[24:44] Holiness they were
[24:46] veiled so they were naked but they were
[24:49] veiled amen praise the Lord a veil means
[24:53] a
[24:54] covering so they were naked and
[24:56] uncovered but yet they were covered and
[24:58] they were covered by the Holy Spirit why
[25:00] because they were obedient to the word
[25:02] they were standing behind the word and
[25:04] the Word was providing for them a
[25:06] covering again in Satan's eting he says
[25:09] notice now the Holy Spirit of God's holy
[25:10] word had a man and a woman naked and
[25:13] didn't know it how beautiful life of the
[25:15] word the seed the word God said there's
[25:17] a tree in the midst of the garden the
[25:19] woman and in the midst of the garden is
[25:21] this tree don't even touch it for the
[25:23] day you eat thereof that day you die
[25:26] they were wholly veiled from it didn't
[25:28] know nothing about it darest to touch it
[25:31] they were wholly veiled they were safe
[25:33] in God's Pavilion they were alive so as
[25:37] long as they stayed behind God's word
[25:40] they were covered they had a covering
[25:42] they had a holy Veil that veiled them to
[25:44] any sense of shame to any sense of
[25:46] nakedness to any lust of the flesh so as
[25:49] long as they stayed behind God's wall
[25:52] God's word God's Veil they themselves
[25:55] were covered they were veiled although
[25:57] Technic te Al we would say they were
[25:59] naked according to the scriptures but
[26:01] but we know that they were under a holy
[26:03] Veil so that's why there was no shame
[26:06] there was also no shame because they
[26:08] were under a veil of innocency yeah
[26:11] because they hadn't violated any word
[26:13] they were never out from behind God's
[26:15] word they were innocent they were pure
[26:17] amen they they had the purest of
[26:19] intentions the purest of Notions the
[26:21] purest of thoughts because why because
[26:23] they were behind God's
[26:25] word and so they were
[26:27] veiled even though they were naked they
[26:29] were
[26:30] veiled now let's go to Genesis chter
[26:35] 3 Verse
[26:40] 6 and when the woman saw that the tree
[26:43] was good for food and that it was
[26:44] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[26:46] desired to make one wise she took of the
[26:49] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[26:50] unto her husband with her and he did
[26:53] eat and the eyes of them both were open
[26:56] and they knew that they were naked and
[26:58] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[27:00] themselves
[27:02] aprons
[27:04] initially they were naked but they were
[27:08] veiled but when they left the word the
[27:11] veil their covering was removed and they
[27:14] recognized that they were
[27:16] naked nothing had nothing had changed in
[27:20] the amount of clothing that they were
[27:21] wearing but what it had changed is when
[27:23] they left the word they lost their
[27:26] covering because the covering came by
[27:28] the word the word produced the covering
[27:31] when they stayed behind the word they
[27:33] had a holy veil of the Holy Spirit
[27:35] covering them but when they moved from
[27:37] innocency to guilt by leaving the word
[27:40] by disbelieving the word and acting
[27:42] contrary to the word now they lost
[27:44] innocency they stepped outside of the
[27:46] word they lost the veil and their eyes
[27:48] were open and the veil was removed and
[27:50] they recognized I'm not
[27:52] covered and the first thing they did was
[27:54] start to make their own
[27:56] covering because now when the veil is
[27:58] lifted they realized I'm not covered I
[28:00] need to be covered now they're shame
[28:02] because they lost the veil of innocency
[28:04] so now they stitch together fig leaves
[28:06] which brother Brenham said is religion
[28:07] and they made their own religion their
[28:09] own covering and started trying to hide
[28:11] their shame their sin behind a covering
[28:14] that they made
[28:16] themselves and Isaiah I'll just read it
[28:19] to you you don't have to turn Isaiah 646
[28:22] says but we are all as un unclean thing
[28:25] and all our righteousnesses are as
[28:27] filthy rags and we all do fate as a leaf
[28:30] and all our iniquities like the wind
[28:31] take us
[28:32] away the the scripture says there is
[28:34] none that doeth good no not one the all
[28:37] of our righteousness and all of our
[28:39] deeds and all of our religion is still
[28:41] as filthy rags and filthy rags is not
[28:44] the covering you need to cover our sin
[28:46] and our nakedness our nakedness must be
[28:48] covered now because we left the veil of
[28:50] innocency so now there requires a
[28:52] covering but that covering can't be
[28:54] anything that you and I do because if
[28:56] that's our righteousness our
[28:58] righteousness is still filthy
[28:59] [Applause]
[29:01] rags so then we go to Genesis we're
[29:04] still in chapter 3 but let's go to verse
[29:07] 9 and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[29:10] said unto him where art thou and he said
[29:12] I heard thy voice in the garden and I
[29:13] was afraid because I was naked and I hid
[29:16] myself and he said who told thee that
[29:19] thou was naked hast thou eaten of the
[29:21] tree whereof I commanded thee and thou
[29:23] should us not
[29:24] eat now we've been through this before
[29:27] so you all know know you all understand
[29:29] this but but they were naked but
[29:34] covered they left the word and lost
[29:36] their covering and realized they were
[29:37] naked and made themselves a
[29:39] covering but when the voice of God came
[29:42] in the garden when the when the presence
[29:44] of God was made known by the voice of
[29:46] God he said I heard thy voice and I hid
[29:48] myself because I was naked amen
[29:50] technically he wasn't naked technically
[29:52] he was covered because he had his fig
[29:54] Leaf apron covering his sin and shame
[29:56] but in the presence of God God he
[29:58] realized this is no covering at all for
[30:00] this sin I'm completely naked in the
[30:03] presence of God so that he was naked but
[30:07] veiled unveiled recognized they were
[30:10] naked put on a veil and the presence of
[30:12] God recognized that they're naked amen
[30:14] this is a an impossible situation but
[30:16] God is going to provide the solution to
[30:18] the
[30:20] problem over we're in verse 21 when he
[30:22] begins to uh bring judgment and
[30:25] Reconciliation
[30:28] it goes to chapter 3: 21 unto Adam also
[30:32] and to his wife did the Lord God make
[30:34] coats of skins and clothe
[30:37] them all of a sudden the man had a
[30:41] god-given covering in the beginning and
[30:44] that god-given covering was a holy Veil
[30:46] that was given to him by the word the
[30:48] word produced The Veil and when they
[30:50] stayed behind the word they were within
[30:51] the veil and they had a god provided
[30:54] covering to cover their
[30:55] nakedness when they left the word amen
[30:59] now they recognized their their position
[31:01] their nakedness they had no covering
[31:03] they tried to make their own covering
[31:04] but in the presence of God they
[31:06] recognized they were still naked they
[31:07] had nothing to cover their shame with
[31:09] but God in his Mercy was going to
[31:12] provide another god-given covering they
[31:15] failed the first god-given covering but
[31:18] God as a Holy Father and a loving father
[31:20] in his mercy and Grace he would provide
[31:22] another covering where they failed the
[31:24] original covering remember if they never
[31:26] failed the original covering in they
[31:28] would never need another covering he
[31:30] already gave them a covering a holy veil
[31:33] by the word amen and they left the word
[31:35] and left the veil now they could not
[31:38] produce anything in themselves that
[31:39] would cover their nakedness and shame
[31:41] but God as a loving father he would make
[31:44] the he would make the restitution he
[31:46] would make the offering so that he could
[31:48] bring them back under another
[31:52] Veil and that veil was the shed blood of
[31:55] a
[31:56] lamb now God would take and slay a lamb
[31:59] and he would take the skin of that lamb
[32:01] and he would take that skin and he would
[32:03] clothe and cover the shame the sin the
[32:06] nakedness of his children and what was
[32:09] he covering them in he was covering them
[32:11] in the skin of an innocent
[32:14] substitute and now under the innocent
[32:16] substitute now they were covered in this
[32:19] in this skin of the lamb and now they
[32:22] could they could continue in life and
[32:24] they could have a bit of uh restoration
[32:26] they could move on because God
[32:28] amen though they Des serve death God
[32:30] took a lamb as a substitute for them and
[32:32] that lamb became their sin so that they
[32:35] could get the Lamb's innocency and the
[32:37] innocency of the Lamb could be their
[32:43] covering God foreshadowed the entire
[32:46] Bible in this chapter
[32:49] amen the entire scripture his whole Plan
[32:52] of Redemption he laid out in one chapter
[32:55] in the Bible if you can read the story
[32:57] of ad Adam and Eve in the Bible you know
[32:59] the whole
[33:00] gospel because man now amen had fallen
[33:04] from the word of God remember the only
[33:06] sin is disbelief in the word and they
[33:09] disbelieved the word and now their veil
[33:11] was gone they were naked they were in
[33:13] corruption they were perverted they were
[33:15] spotted they were Scarlet they were
[33:17] Crimson amen and they need a covering
[33:19] amen their own covering could never
[33:21] cover amen it it could never cover their
[33:24] sin and shame but God was going to take
[33:26] something that was still innocent and
[33:28] the innocent was going to cover for the
[33:30] guilty because they lost their innocency
[33:33] what they needed was a veil of innocency
[33:35] to cover their
[33:37] nakedness and that lamb gave its
[33:40] innocency that lamb took their place and
[33:43] became the Sinner and died the sinner's
[33:47] death so that he could give and yield
[33:50] his innocency back to them and the
[33:53] Lamb's innocency would become their
[33:55] covering
[33:58] yeah and remember how brother brandham
[34:01] said he saw in a vision he said I I see
[34:05] Adam put his arms around Eve and as they
[34:08] walk out of the garden amen and they can
[34:10] see the bloody flaps of the skin as it
[34:14] slaps them in the thigh or in the leg as
[34:16] they walk out of the out of the Garden
[34:18] of Eden brother bam caught it in a
[34:20] vision and he saw amen that they walked
[34:23] out amen one arm around the other but
[34:25] they were completely clothed and a coat
[34:28] amen is a fulllength long garment it's a
[34:31] full covering what a coat is amen so
[34:34] they were covered completely covered by
[34:36] what by the lamb and when I when I look
[34:39] at this I find it astounding that God
[34:42] allowed brother benam to have a vision
[34:43] of this so that we would have a clearer
[34:45] picture of what they were covered in
[34:47] they were covered in fresh a fresh
[34:50] covering of a fresh kill amen and that
[34:53] fresh kill wasn't a tanned hide it
[34:56] wasn't tanned because the trickle of
[34:58] blood from the inside of the skin was
[35:00] still trickling down their leg as it
[35:01] slapped against their leg so if it
[35:03] wasn't a tan skin if it was a fresh skin
[35:06] taken off a fresh kill of an innocent
[35:09] substitute that means they were wearing
[35:11] amen the skin that still had the
[35:15] blood still had the blood on the inside
[35:18] that was running down they were under a
[35:19] blood covering a substitute had paid its
[35:21] price but the covering still had the
[35:24] blood amen and and I believe and I don't
[35:26] know this for sure but just by what
[35:28] brother bam said if it was fresh and
[35:30] untanned it must have still had the wool
[35:32] on the outside and so now what they were
[35:35] walking in was white wool amen your sins
[35:38] of their Scarlet shall be white as
[35:40] wool now the whiteness of the skin of
[35:43] the Lamb becomes their whiteness now
[35:46] they're walking in innocency be why
[35:49] because their sins are covered
[35:54] for praise be to God Amen praise be to
[35:58] God this is what God has done for us and
[36:00] this is what God is doing for
[36:05] us
[36:09] amen from the very
[36:12] beginning he took his children who had
[36:15] fallen from righteousness Who Fallen
[36:17] from the
[36:18] word and he began to restore them by
[36:22] slaying a lamb a substitute taking the
[36:25] skin of that Lamb with the fresh kill of
[36:28] a lamb the fresh substitute with the
[36:31] fresh blood putting it on his children
[36:34] and from the beginning he covered them
[36:36] in Blood and robed them in
[36:40] white why do you think when we get to
[36:42] the Book of Revelations their robes are
[36:44] white they're robed in white they're
[36:46] robed in white it all started in Genesis
[36:49] that's been God's plan from the
[36:53] beginning brother R says in the message
[36:56] look he says God being full full of
[36:57] grace and mercy took a substitute and it
[37:00] was a lamb or an animal was offered a
[37:02] substitutionary death but the blood of
[37:05] bulls and goats as Hebrews here said
[37:06] just previously to where I read cannot
[37:08] take away sin it only covered sin it was
[37:12] a propitiation truly but it just covered
[37:15] sin for it was speaking with good
[37:17] conscience looking forward to when the
[37:19] blood would come that would cleanse sin
[37:21] divorce it put it away forever that was
[37:24] the blood of the ultimate lamb Jesus
[37:25] Christ amen in the message God's power
[37:28] to transform brother B says now if
[37:31] you'll turn if you wish to write it down
[37:33] to Revelation the thirr chapter the Holy
[37:35] Spirit predicting this last age to the
[37:38] lean Pentecostal Church age in the last
[37:40] days he said Thou Art naked and blind
[37:44] and know it not amen there is God's seed
[37:48] under innocence not knowing at all they
[37:50] were naked under a veil of the Holy
[37:53] Spirit veiled them from sin and now in
[37:56] the last Church age we find hear that
[37:57] they are naked again and don't know it
[38:00] yeah but it's not the Holy Spirit Veil
[38:03] it's the veil that Satan slipped over
[38:05] Eve back there a veil of lust the lust
[38:10] Veil let's turn to this in in Revelation
[38:13] chapter 3 and look at this together
[38:31] Revelation 3 and verse
[38:36] 14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[38:38] the leans write these things sayith the
[38:40] amen the faithful and true witness the
[38:42] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[38:44] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[38:47] hot I would thou were cold or hot so
[38:50] then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[38:51] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[38:54] out of my mouth because thou sayest I am
[38:57] rich and increase with goods and have
[38:58] need of nothing and knowest not Thou Art
[39:01] wretched and miserable and poor and
[39:04] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[39:07] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[39:09] mayest be rich and white rment that thou
[39:11] mayest be clothed and that thy shame of
[39:13] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[39:15] thine eyes with isab that thou mayest
[39:18] see as many as I love I rebuke and Chase
[39:20] and be zealous therefore and repent it's
[39:24] a Marvel that at the end time we find
[39:26] the church to supposedly the Church of
[39:28] God Amen standing in a condition where
[39:30] they're miserable wretched poor blind
[39:33] and naked and in this naked condition
[39:37] Hey listen when we get to this last
[39:39] Church age they're naked but they're all
[39:41] walking around with some form of
[39:42] clothing
[39:43] on this is a spiritual nakedness just
[39:46] like amen the nakedness in in Adam and
[39:49] Eve in the beginning was covered by a
[39:51] holy spiritual Veil amen this now has a
[39:54] natural Garment of some sort but they're
[39:56] spiritual completely naked just when
[39:59] just the same as when Adam was there
[40:01] with his fig leafes
[40:03] on and so now he says uh uh I counsel
[40:06] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[40:08] that thou mayest be rich and white rment
[40:11] not just rment but white rment speaking
[40:13] back to Purity
[40:15] cleansing whiteness white rment that
[40:18] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[40:19] shame of thy nakedness do not appear so
[40:22] now God is saying I have in this end
[40:26] time a coverage for your nakedness I
[40:28] have a white garment and I counsel you
[40:30] to come to me amen that I might give you
[40:33] this white rment that the shame of your
[40:35] nakedness do not appear that means in
[40:37] the in the end time in this lateran age
[40:40] you have a people so deceived that
[40:42] they're walking around completely naked
[40:44] at least Adam in the presence of God
[40:46] recognized that his fig leaes was
[40:49] nakedness amen at least when God's voice
[40:52] came walking in the garden something
[40:54] struck him and he knew that he was naked
[40:56] although he could look down and see the
[40:58] same covering that he tried to use to
[41:00] convince himself a few minutes earlier
[41:02] and when the presence of God came when
[41:03] the voice of God came Walking In The
[41:05] Garden in the cool of the evening he
[41:07] knew that those fig leaves were no
[41:09] covering at all that he was completely
[41:11] naked and now we've done the same thing
[41:13] through thousands of years of religion
[41:15] we've come to the end time and we've
[41:16] heard the voice of God in the cool of
[41:18] the evening come walking amongst us and
[41:20] it's a shame that there's people who
[41:22] don't even know they're naked
[41:27] but oh God May It Strike our hearts like
[41:30] never before that anything I do is
[41:32] nakedness anything I try is nakedness
[41:34] all my righteousness is filthy rags what
[41:37] do I need in this end time I need a
[41:39] white reignment that he provides me in
[41:41] this end time I need a covering so that
[41:44] the shame of my nakedness doesn't
[41:48] appear
[41:50] amen we're speaking spiritually now the
[41:55] whole thing is a spiritual applic
[41:59] application brother B said back in
[42:02] Satan's Eden
[42:04] again he says
[42:07] notice he said take our women now if you
[42:10] want to see what condition the church is
[42:12] in watch the way women are acting she
[42:15] always represents the church and Satan's
[42:17] Eden of sin and unbelief a religious
[42:19] perversion perverted Kingdom instead of
[42:21] taking God's word they have took the
[42:23] intellectual learning of man and instead
[42:25] of taking the church they took the
[42:27] organization and they're bringing it to
[42:29] one great head now notice perverted from
[42:33] innocence don't miss this now the church
[42:36] has been with the lust Veil on notice
[42:38] what it's done to her it's perverted her
[42:40] from innocence to knowledge the holy
[42:44] Veil she she was innocent with the lust
[42:46] Veil she is knowledge she knows it's
[42:49] Pleasant she knows what it does see it's
[42:51] a fruit a tree to be desired making one
[42:53] wise see she is perverted from innocence
[42:55] to knowledge from holiness to filth and
[42:58] lust and from life to death so what
[43:01] happened at the beginning she went from
[43:03] life to
[43:05] death she went from innocency to
[43:08] knowledge she lusted after knowledge she
[43:10] wanted to use intellect amen and she
[43:12] left innocency and innocency was found
[43:15] in simply staying behind the word amen
[43:18] without questioning without reasoning
[43:20] without scientific experimentation amen
[43:23] her innocency was preserved just by
[43:26] staying behind the word when she stayed
[43:28] behind the word she stayed in innocency
[43:30] she had a veil a covering for her
[43:32] nakedness amen but the minute she left
[43:34] by knowledge she left she left innocency
[43:37] for
[43:39] knowledge oh God help us help us never
[43:43] leave the Simplicity of
[43:46] innocency for
[43:51] knowledge let's go to Isaiah 61 together
[44:05] Isaiah
[44:07] 61 and let's look at verse
[44:16] 10 Isaiah 61 and10 I will greatly
[44:20] rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be
[44:22] joyful in my God for he hath clothed me
[44:26] with the garments of salvation Heath
[44:28] covered me with the robe of
[44:30] righteousness as a bridegroom decked
[44:32] himself with ornaments and as a bride
[44:34] adorne herself with her Jewels so now
[44:38] Isaiah is rejoicing here in the prophecy
[44:41] he clothed me with the garments of
[44:43] Salvation Heath covered me with the robe
[44:45] of righteousness and he types it with
[44:48] the covering of a bridegroom and a bride
[44:51] my what a what a spot of uh
[44:54] foreshadow of Prophecy
[44:57] and so when we look at this scripture
[45:00] he's telling us he's telling us who has
[45:03] clothed
[45:05] who who's done the clothing and who's
[45:07] provided the
[45:09] clothes remember when Adam fell amen and
[45:12] he realized he was naked he provided his
[45:14] own covering but that covering was
[45:16] nakedness in the presence of God Amen
[45:18] but now there's nothing we we get to the
[45:21] place where there's nothing that Adam
[45:23] can do to fix his
[45:24] situation he can't reverse what's been
[45:27] done he can never change it he can never
[45:29] take it back he can never make it right
[45:31] there's not one blessed thing in the
[45:32] world that Adam can do to reverse this
[45:34] course of action he is stuck he tried
[45:37] with his own ability and his own
[45:39] knowledge and his own intellect and his
[45:40] own efforts he tried to make a covering
[45:43] that covering was totally unraveled and
[45:45] unveiled in the presence of a living God
[45:47] so now he stands there before a living
[45:50] God Amen absolutely unveiled to anything
[45:53] he tried to do and there's not a blessed
[45:55] thing in the world that he can do to
[45:58] cover his shame and
[46:01] nakedness so he's totally dependent on
[46:03] his
[46:04] father he's standing there in shame he's
[46:08] standing there in nakedness he's
[46:10] standing there in an irreversible
[46:12] condition yeah without a hope in the
[46:16] world right and his father takes a
[46:21] lamb listen if
[46:23] we we've learned these things since
[46:26] we're little toddlers we've learned
[46:27] these things since we're little kids
[46:28] those who' been raised in church and we
[46:30] know the story we've seen the picture
[46:32] books we've colored pictures about it
[46:34] amen but I don't think we realize the
[46:35] gravity of the situation he's standing
[46:38] there with no hope in the world nothing
[46:40] that he himself can ever do to ever
[46:43] cover his shame and nakedness he's lost
[46:45] he's finished he's done and there's
[46:47] nothing he can do
[46:49] himself right and here comes God Amen
[46:52] coming down in judgment and God is now
[46:54] ad ministering judgment and he's
[46:56] standing here naked exposed helpless
[46:59] with irreversible damage and there's
[47:01] nothing he can do but he's got a loving
[47:03] father who created him and has a purpose
[47:05] for his life and that father goes and
[47:07] finds an innocent lamb that's never
[47:09] sinned never disbelieved never done
[47:11] anything wrong and he took that lamb and
[47:14] he slayed that lamb can you imagine what
[47:16] Adam was thinking when he was watching
[47:18] God there had never been death there had
[47:21] never been Bloodshed there never been
[47:22] the bleeding of the Lamb there never
[47:24] been the stench of fresh flowing blood
[47:26] this was
[47:28] death
[47:30] yes this was I I guarantee a traumatic
[47:35] event first time he had ever witnessed
[47:38] it first time he had ever seen death
[47:40] first time he had ever witnessed
[47:41] suffering the first time he' ever seen
[47:43] blood flow the first time he had heard a
[47:45] desperate bleed the first time he had
[47:47] heard a death
[47:48] rattle
[47:52] yes and it was God doing it
[47:57] it was God afflicting the punishment it
[47:59] was God causing the
[48:03] death what was he doing it
[48:06] for because he had to have a covering of
[48:11] innocency to cover the shame of his son
[48:16] sir something had to die because that
[48:19] was the penalty for sin so God took this
[48:21] innocent lamb and this innocent lamb
[48:24] became Adam by imputation
[48:28] and he imputed Adam's sin upon this lamb
[48:30] and slayed slayed the lamb not for the
[48:33] lamb but he slayed the lamb for Adam's
[48:35] sins amen and then he took the skin off
[48:39] of the lamb and he placed it upon his
[48:41] son and now his son was covered and
[48:44] could continue on amen he wasn't smitten
[48:47] dead in an instant he continued on and
[48:49] God was trying he was beginning the
[48:51] process of restoring fellowship with his
[48:53] Fallen son
[48:57] what a what an
[48:59] experience that would have been to live
[49:02] through it's not a coloring book page it
[49:06] was a
[49:08] reality but neither is Jesus Christ
[49:11] nailed to the cross a coloring book page
[49:14] it's a reality amen who was nailed to
[49:16] the cross that's me he wasn't there for
[49:18] him he was there for me he was nailed
[49:20] because of my sin because of my
[49:22] nakedness because I left the word
[49:24] because I left the veil of innocency not
[49:26] just I was born wrong I chose to do
[49:29] wrong amen and he took all of my sin and
[49:32] all of my shame and all of my perversion
[49:35] and all of my red spots and he shed his
[49:37] blood and he died and he was the
[49:39] innocent
[49:42] lamb so that God could clothe me in a
[49:46] white
[49:48] robe
[49:53] amen praise God let's go over to
[49:55] Revelation chapter 3 I'm going to read a
[49:57] couple scriptures here as we move
[50:00] forward with this thought Revelation CH
[50:07] 3 verse
[50:13] four Revelation 3
[50:16] and4 thou Hast a few names even in
[50:18] Sardis which ha not defiled their
[50:20] garments and they shall walk with me in
[50:22] white for they are worthy
[50:27] he that overcometh the same shall be
[50:29] clothed in white reignment and I will
[50:31] not blot out his name out of the book of
[50:33] life but I will confess his name before
[50:35] my father before his angels when we get
[50:38] to the Sardis age he begins to say
[50:42] there's a few names even as Sardis which
[50:46] have not defiled their
[50:48] garments you know he is not talking
[50:51] about the clothes they were
[50:55] wearing Maybe he was talking about their
[50:57] garments weren't
[50:59] defiled what are the garments that a
[51:01] Christian wears what is the spiritual
[51:03] garment that we wear well the prophet of
[51:05] God told us that we are clothed in the
[51:07] word of God we actually are putting on
[51:09] Christ which is the word and there was
[51:11] those in sard us who weren't defiling
[51:13] the word that they had
[51:16] received you have a few and
[51:21] Sardis who have not defiled their
[51:24] garments that means theyve stayed true
[51:26] to the message of their
[51:28] day they haven't defiled their garments
[51:31] and they shall walk with me in white
[51:34] listen he didn't he didn't describe what
[51:38] those garments looked like he didn't
[51:40] describe uh uh how they were made all he
[51:42] said is they didn't defile their
[51:44] garments whatever they had been given
[51:45] they were wearing and they weren't
[51:47] defiling it whatever that messenger had
[51:49] brought for that day they were clothed
[51:51] in it and they weren't defiling but he
[51:53] says if those who've kept their garments
[51:56] shall Walk With Me In White for they are
[51:59] worthy he that overcometh the same shall
[52:02] be clothed in white rment and I will not
[52:05] blot out his name out of The Book of
[52:07] Life he's promising if they not defile
[52:10] the Garment they have they're going to
[52:11] have a white rment amen there's a
[52:14] promise that's coming let's go to
[52:16] Ephesians chapter 5
[52:20] together book of Ephesians
[52:32] Ephesians chapter
[52:36] 5 in verse
[52:40] 25 says husbands love your wives even as
[52:42] Christ also loved the church and gave
[52:44] himself for it that he might sanctify
[52:46] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[52:49] Water by the word that he might present
[52:51] it to himself a glorious church not
[52:53] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[52:57] but it should be holy and without
[53:00] blemish so God is going to cleanse his
[53:03] bride God is going to have a bride that
[53:07] is going to be restored that's going to
[53:09] be cleaned from the spots that's going
[53:11] to be cleaned from the blemishes that's
[53:13] going to be pure amen and restored to
[53:16] him and he says he's going to sanctify
[53:18] and cleanse it with the washing how's he
[53:20] going to cleanse it by the washing of
[53:22] the water of the word the word amen is
[53:25] going to remove the spots the word is
[53:27] going to bring Purity the word is going
[53:28] to remove blemish or spot or wrinkle he
[53:32] says that he might presented to himself
[53:33] a glorious church not having spot or
[53:36] wrinkle or any such thing that it should
[53:38] be holy and without blemish so God is
[53:41] going to have a bride amen that is going
[53:44] to be holy and without
[53:46] blemish do you believe that so how is he
[53:49] going to get a bride that's holy and
[53:51] without blemish well it'll probably be
[53:53] when the bride finally figures out what
[53:54] she's doing wrong and gets her act
[53:56] together and starts doing all the right
[53:58] things right because she's got to be a
[54:01] pure bride without spot or wrinkle she's
[54:03] got to start getting her act together
[54:05] she's got to start listening she's going
[54:07] to have to Buck Up
[54:10] and that's not what the scripture says
[54:14] anywhere but it says that he might
[54:17] sanctify and cleanse it he cleanse it he
[54:21] cleanse it she doesn't clean herself
[54:24] he's going to sanctify and cleanse her
[54:26] with the washing of the Water by the
[54:27] word that means if he's going to wash
[54:29] her by the word he's got to provide the
[54:31] word that'll do the washing because she
[54:33] has nothing she can do herself the bride
[54:36] stands listen the bride stands when you
[54:38] come into this world you may be
[54:40] predestinated to be bride of Jesus
[54:41] Christ but before you come to the
[54:43] washing of this word and the clothing of
[54:45] this word you're standing in the same
[54:46] spot Adam was standing in there's
[54:48] irreversible damage there's not a thing
[54:50] in the world that you can do you need a
[54:53] heavenly father to come down and provide
[54:55] a veil of Innocence to cover your shame
[54:57] and
[54:58] nakedness he didn't ask you to do it
[55:00] yourself if you do it yourself you'll do
[55:02] what Adam did and you'll create another
[55:04] denomination to add to the 40,000
[55:07] denominations and it won't work any
[55:09] better than
[55:12] 40,000 so we stand Here
[55:15] Helpless hopeless in Leo deia miserable
[55:19] wretched blind naked and don't know
[55:22] it until we hear the voice of God come
[55:25] walking in the cool of the evening and
[55:28] then we realize we're naked when we
[55:31] realize we're naked we need a garment
[55:32] but he says come to me for I have a
[55:35] white garment that'll cover your
[55:37] nakedness the shame of your
[55:40] nakedness
[55:42] amen so now it says he will sanctify and
[55:47] cleanse with the washing of Water by the
[55:49] word that he might present it to
[55:51] himself a glorious Church read these
[55:54] scriptures and tell me what the church
[55:55] is supposed to to
[55:57] do to save herself to cleanse herself to
[56:00] sanctify herself and to make herself
[56:05] white we'll get to that in a minute he
[56:09] might present it to himself a glorious
[56:11] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[56:14] such thing but it should be holy and
[56:17] without
[56:18] blemish now we don't we're not ignorant
[56:21] of the fact that brother Benham said God
[56:22] put himself in partnership with man that
[56:24] there's something for you to do too
[56:27] but that thing for you to do is not make
[56:29] your own garment not wash yourself not
[56:32] provide a word that's pure and clean for
[56:34] the washing not to make yourself wrinkle
[56:37] free and spot and blemish free that's
[56:39] not your job that's his job we are own
[56:42] partnership God and there is something
[56:44] for us to do but that part's not ours to
[56:46] do that's his to do and he's promised to
[56:48] do
[56:49] it
[56:51] Amen brother B says in the invisible
[56:53] union he says the first wedding was n it
[56:57] was you never done it he's talking about
[56:59] the first you come married to an Adam
[57:01] nature because you were born
[57:03] wrong but he says that first wedding is
[57:06] analed as if it never happened it was
[57:09] discredited
[57:11] yeah off the
[57:13] books your first wedding was an knowed
[57:15] it was you never done it in the first
[57:17] place because there's only one thing
[57:20] could do it that would be God come down
[57:22] himself and took your place in the form
[57:24] of the Son of God Jesus Christ and
[57:26] washed you by the water of the washing
[57:28] of the Water by the word the word not
[57:31] the denominational not denomination the
[57:33] word washed you but if you won't stand
[57:36] in the water of the word how you going
[57:38] to be washed you're still as spotted as
[57:40] Eve
[57:41] was so in this partnership amen with the
[57:44] prophet brought it this way what am I
[57:45] supposed to do I'm just supposed to stay
[57:48] in the flow of the water amen I don't
[57:50] provide the water I don't do the
[57:52] cleansing I don't make myself white but
[57:55] my job is just to stay under the flowing
[57:59] of the
[58:01] water why because he's never removed
[58:03] free choice from me yeah we're in
[58:07] partnership with God we have something
[58:08] to do that's something to do is just say
[58:10] wash me Lord I'm not going anywhere wash
[58:13] me pour the bucket over me again and
[58:16] again and again if I need another
[58:17] dousing douse me again if I need another
[58:20] scrubbing scrub me again I can't cleanse
[58:25] myself let's go to Revelation
[58:41] 19 Revelation
[58:46] 19 and I want to read from verse 6 and I
[58:50] heard as it were the voice of a great
[58:52] multitude and as the voice of many
[58:53] Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[58:55] thundering saying
[58:56] Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[58:58] reth let us be glad and rejoice and give
[59:01] honor to him for the marriage of the
[59:03] Lamb is come and his wife have made
[59:06] herself ready and to her was granted
[59:08] that she should be aray in fine linen
[59:10] clean and white for the fine linen is
[59:12] the righteousness of the
[59:15] Saints it's amazing she's she's he says
[59:20] let us rejoice and be glad for the
[59:22] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[59:24] wife have made herself ready
[59:27] see that we're back on partnership again
[59:28] there's something for her to do and it
[59:31] said and to her was granted that she
[59:33] should be ar raay in fine linen clean
[59:35] and white for the fine linen is the
[59:37] righteousness of the Saints I hope
[59:39] you're seeing this actually isn't a
[59:41] picture of the Garment the bride's going
[59:43] to be wearing literally this is a
[59:45] spiritual condition he's going to bring
[59:47] her into he's going to have a linen
[59:49] garment that's going to be pure and
[59:51] white and Winkle free with no
[59:53] stains and her was granted that she
[59:55] should be be a ra in fine linen clean
[59:57] and white with for the fine linen is the
[59:59] righteousness of the Saints and so now
[1:00:01] when he says it's the righteousness of
[1:00:03] the Saints you you can start to think
[1:00:05] well this is our righteousness but you
[1:00:07] got to remember we have no righteousness
[1:00:09] our righteousness is as filthy rags so
[1:00:12] what is the righteousness of the Saints
[1:00:14] the righteousness of the Saints is his
[1:00:16] righteousness imputed unto us because we
[1:00:18] believe his
[1:00:20] word not because we did something not
[1:00:23] because we worked the work not because
[1:00:25] we were able to accomplish some Deeds
[1:00:27] but his righteousness is is what's
[1:00:29] imputed unto us when we
[1:00:32] believe Abraham had righteousness
[1:00:34] imputed unto him why did righteousness
[1:00:36] was imputed unto Abraham because he
[1:00:38] believed amen now we have righteousness
[1:00:40] imputed unto us why do we have
[1:00:42] righteousness imputed unto us because we
[1:00:44] believe amen so whose righteousness is
[1:00:46] the righteousness of the Saints it's not
[1:00:48] your righteousness it's his
[1:00:50] righteousness imputed unto you because
[1:00:53] you believe
[1:00:58] Amen in The Invisible
[1:01:02] union he
[1:01:06] says he says you're standing
[1:01:09] completely you never sinned at the first
[1:01:11] place brother bren's now in 1965 he's in
[1:01:14] November 25th in 1965 he's right around
[1:01:17] Thanksgiving time amen and he's coming
[1:01:19] and preaching a Thanksgiving message and
[1:01:21] this is just a short time before he's
[1:01:22] taken off the scene this is the end of
[1:01:24] his ministry and at the end of the
[1:01:25] ministry he's come to realize amen that
[1:01:28] this water that's provided in Ephesians
[1:01:30] 5 is here this garment for the bride to
[1:01:33] wear is here and he's coming here and
[1:01:35] he's showing you how much of a garment's
[1:01:37] been presented and how much of a pure
[1:01:39] water is here look at what he says he
[1:01:41] says you never sinned at the first place
[1:01:45] right God don't even know it's in the
[1:01:48] sea of forgetfulness you never did it
[1:01:51] you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:01:53] but really from the beginning you were
[1:01:55] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:01:56] of God you're standing there washed and
[1:01:59] your old book of divorcement is put away
[1:02:02] and it's dead absolutely out of
[1:02:04] existence even in the mind of God Hey
[1:02:07] listen when he says that he means it and
[1:02:09] I believe it amen it's not that I should
[1:02:11] be Conjuring up that old book of
[1:02:13] divorcement I was like this and I was
[1:02:15] like that and I was like that it's out
[1:02:17] of the mind of God forever totally out
[1:02:19] of existence I never did it in the first
[1:02:21] place
[1:02:26] this is what the message is intended to
[1:02:28] bring us
[1:02:31] to he said washed in the blood I'm sorry
[1:02:36] divorce must put away it's dead
[1:02:38] absolutely out of existence even in the
[1:02:40] mind of God you're The Virtuous bride of
[1:02:44] Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[1:02:46] precious virtuous sinless Son of God
[1:02:48] standing with pure unadulterated bride
[1:02:51] word that he Washed by the Water of his
[1:02:53] own blood that became flesh and
[1:02:55] manifested that he might take you which
[1:02:57] were predestinated in the bosom of the
[1:02:59] father before the beginning the same as
[1:03:01] he was what is he have to do to take a
[1:03:06] bride he can't take a polluted
[1:03:09] bride he's got to wash her he's got to
[1:03:12] clothe her he's got to bring her back to
[1:03:16] innocency he can't marry listen Christ
[1:03:19] can't be United with sin Christ can't be
[1:03:22] United amen with corruption and
[1:03:24] perversion so what does he have to do he
[1:03:27] has to
[1:03:29] change though your sins be like Scarlet
[1:03:32] they'll be made white as
[1:03:34] snow he's got to do it because he can't
[1:03:37] Unite with the sin so he's got to do
[1:03:39] something about the
[1:03:41] sin listen to what brother M says again
[1:03:44] in The Invisible union says what is sin
[1:03:48] sin is
[1:03:50] unbelief we know this we've talked about
[1:03:52] this so many times we we know it but we
[1:03:55] don't know
[1:03:56] it I'm convinced we know it but we don't
[1:03:58] fully realize
[1:04:00] it because we keep thinking of all the
[1:04:02] bad things we've ever done and they keep
[1:04:05] coming in our mind and the one flaw that
[1:04:07] we have in humanity amen that God has
[1:04:09] perfected is God is able to
[1:04:12] forget but we're
[1:04:13] not how I wish I had that mind that
[1:04:17] could
[1:04:19] forget God is able to forget and put it
[1:04:21] out of existence amen I'm not so in my
[1:04:24] Humanity I keep going back to worse days
[1:04:27] and worse things and that worst day and
[1:04:29] worse things might have been
[1:04:34] yesterday and we keep knocking oursel
[1:04:37] out of position because of those
[1:04:40] things God's not taking us out of
[1:04:42] position we take ourselves out of our
[1:04:44] positionen because of our own
[1:04:47] mind so what is sin sin is unbelief
[1:04:51] unbelief in what the word unbelief in
[1:04:54] God which is the word word pure
[1:04:58] unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon
[1:05:00] for the skies amen standing ready think
[1:05:04] your garments Washed by the Water of the
[1:05:06] bleeding word the word become blood the
[1:05:09] word bled for you you are washed in the
[1:05:11] bleeding word the word bleeding the life
[1:05:13] of God in the word and the Word was bled
[1:05:16] for you that you might be washed from
[1:05:18] the filth of these prostitutes and be
[1:05:20] cleaned and Sanctified by the washing of
[1:05:22] the water of the word and makes your
[1:05:25] mind and heart stayed on God and on his
[1:05:28] word so he starts off by what sin you're
[1:05:31] being purified from sin what is sin
[1:05:34] unbelief what is causing the
[1:05:36] purification it's the bleeding word
[1:05:38] what's the bleeding word doing to purify
[1:05:40] me from sin because the bleeding word is
[1:05:43] a restoration of the word so they we're
[1:05:45] not caught up in the fallacies and the
[1:05:47] false doctrines and false understanding
[1:05:49] that came by knowledge what's he doing
[1:05:51] he's bringing back a pure word so that
[1:05:54] you can come by a pure seed inside can
[1:05:57] reach up and say that ain't nothing but
[1:05:58] the truth brother brandham and it's
[1:06:00] declaring that the righteousness of
[1:06:02] Christ is imputed unto you because you
[1:06:05] believe not because you did because you
[1:06:08] believe not because you do but because
[1:06:10] you
[1:06:12] believe that's the gospel that's what
[1:06:15] makes children of Abraham that was
[1:06:16] Abraham's righteousness he's the father
[1:06:18] of the faithful he's the father of Faith
[1:06:21] amen it's the faith in the present tense
[1:06:23] word of God Amen that's the leading word
[1:06:26] the word that's shedding its blood right
[1:06:28] now for us it's the fresh kill of the
[1:06:31] word brother Brenham said that has the
[1:06:32] fresh skin and that fresh covering where
[1:06:35] you can be clothed in the fresh kill of
[1:06:37] the word and you will walk and there
[1:06:39] going to be a trickle of blood from the
[1:06:40] inside of this word that's fresh and
[1:06:43] running down your
[1:06:47] legs because in Leo deia he says you're
[1:06:50] naked you don't know it but come and by
[1:06:51] of
[1:06:52] me I've got a white raymen in this time
[1:06:56] amen that the shame of your nakedness
[1:06:58] will no longer show no longer in
[1:07:01] deception no longer in unbelief no
[1:07:03] longer Amen in fallacy from denomination
[1:07:06] but the word has been restored you say
[1:07:08] but but brother Chad I don't understand
[1:07:10] all of it he never required
[1:07:12] understanding he never required
[1:07:13] intellectualism Eve was never required
[1:07:15] to understand why God said don't touch
[1:07:18] it wasn't required to understand the
[1:07:20] science behind it to know the
[1:07:21] implications of it she was only to
[1:07:23] believe it and stay behind it
[1:07:29] yes and when by knowledge she was
[1:07:32] deceived and
[1:07:33] disbelieved and acted on that she moved
[1:07:37] out and lost her veil of
[1:07:39] innocency and became
[1:07:41] perverted and needed a
[1:07:46] substitute but now God has brought back
[1:07:50] a
[1:07:52] covering amen his word
[1:07:57] see it
[1:07:58] was in John 1:1 we quote it all the time
[1:08:01] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:08:04] was with God and the Word was
[1:08:06] God we go to John 1:14 and the Word was
[1:08:09] made
[1:08:10] flesh so it means what was God at one
[1:08:13] time God expressed through his word and
[1:08:16] that expression took on a form as a
[1:08:18] human being Jesus Christ God made
[1:08:21] flesh and that word that's where brother
[1:08:25] B said that word became flesh in Jesus
[1:08:27] Christ and that word went to Calvary and
[1:08:30] that word was beaten and that word was
[1:08:32] pierced and that word bled that's where
[1:08:34] brother brandham gets this whole concept
[1:08:35] the word bled for you the word died for
[1:08:38] you because Jesus Christ was the
[1:08:40] fullness of the word the fullness of the
[1:08:42] godhead bodily and that fullness of the
[1:08:44] word was bleeding for you at
[1:08:52] Calvary there's so many Concepts that
[1:08:55] brother B puts together to try to
[1:08:56] explain these things he starts talking
[1:08:58] about the fresh kill of the word amen
[1:09:00] that there's a there's a there's a fresh
[1:09:02] kill there's a fresh sacrifice amen
[1:09:04] every day and there's a word for this
[1:09:06] day which is the message of the hour
[1:09:08] amen and it's freshness amen it's got
[1:09:10] the blood still in it it's got the life
[1:09:12] still in it and it's the life and the
[1:09:14] blood and the and the word that's
[1:09:16] covering our shame and covering our
[1:09:18] nakedness too many people are trying to
[1:09:20] use something from a previous day what
[1:09:22] was in a previous day was good for the
[1:09:24] previous today amen but God has a
[1:09:27] covering for today amen amen and that
[1:09:30] covering is
[1:09:32] fresh it's not been
[1:09:37] tanned it still has the blood with it it
[1:09:40] still has the flesh amen the covering
[1:09:42] the skin because it was the veil that
[1:09:45] hid the word amen was that that that
[1:09:47] innocent lamb what was that innocent
[1:09:49] lamb that innocent lamb was becoming the
[1:09:52] word because it was foreshadowing the
[1:09:53] Lamb of God so what was God slaying on
[1:09:56] that day when Adam sent God was slaying
[1:09:58] the
[1:10:01] word what was he clothing them with with
[1:10:03] the word because this was in his mind
[1:10:05] before the foundation of the world and
[1:10:07] he was going to come and he was going to
[1:10:08] be the lamb himself and and the and the
[1:10:10] that word made flesh now that word was
[1:10:13] going to be the
[1:10:17] covering so they were covered in the
[1:10:20] word the bleeding
[1:10:23] word this isn't a new concept when
[1:10:25] brother Brenham grabs his terminology
[1:10:27] he's explaining the entire gospel it
[1:10:30] sounds weird cuz we never heard
[1:10:31] preachers preach like that before we
[1:10:33] never heard these terms but it's spoton
[1:10:35] with the entire
[1:10:39] Bible and so in this
[1:10:42] day brother Brandon preached
[1:10:44] indictment is that right what do he
[1:10:47] preach indictment for for the second
[1:10:48] crucifixtion of Jesus
[1:10:51] Christ but we didn't see a man like the
[1:10:54] man who walk walk by the Sea of Galilee
[1:10:56] we didn't see a man nailed to a cross
[1:10:58] what how did they crucify Jesus Christ
[1:11:00] at the same time because he came back in
[1:11:02] the fullness of the word which was the
[1:11:04] same thing that was nailed to the cross
[1:11:06] same exact thing nothing different that
[1:11:09] was the word made flesh this is the word
[1:11:11] made manifest yeah it's the same thing
[1:11:16] so when Jesus Christ came back in this
[1:11:18] day as the fullness of the word amen the
[1:11:20] person of the word what did the nomin
[1:11:22] the denominations do they did the same
[1:11:24] thing they 2,000 years ago they
[1:11:26] crucified the Lord
[1:11:31] aresh Brother Bram said in that day when
[1:11:35] they took the Lamb of God and slayed the
[1:11:37] Lamb of God now what they did is they
[1:11:39] killed the old order that God had mercy
[1:11:42] through the law of Moses and from that
[1:11:44] day it was the lamb and the lamb
[1:11:48] alone but in this day when they took the
[1:11:51] Lamb of God the word of God in this day
[1:11:53] and they rejected it and they slain it
[1:11:55] from that day forward it was no longer
[1:11:58] Mercy at God winking at the ignorance of
[1:12:01] the church ages but it became the word
[1:12:03] and the word
[1:12:04] only right the bleeding bloody word amen
[1:12:09] the blood of atonement for us in this
[1:12:11] day which was the word that's been
[1:12:12] restored and it becomes also our
[1:12:16] covering clothed in the bleeding bloody
[1:12:22] word maybe with the wool still attack
[1:12:25] Ed so you can be white as
[1:12:33] War brother BM said in present stage of
[1:12:35] my Ministry said I'm trusting him
[1:12:39] someday I don't know when for a crowning
[1:12:41] of my Ministry I've stayed just as true
[1:12:42] as I could be I don't know what it'll be
[1:12:45] I don't know when it'll be and just when
[1:12:47] he's ready I'm I am done up here I hope
[1:12:51] when he will Crown my Ministry of this
[1:12:54] of letting me take the clothes of the
[1:12:55] word and dress his bride in the cloth of
[1:12:58] the word for his
[1:13:00] righteousness what a brother want the
[1:13:02] crowning of his ministry to be to take
[1:13:04] the word of God and put a garment on the
[1:13:07] bride amen what kind of garment a
[1:13:10] wedding
[1:13:12] garment that's the kind of garment amen
[1:13:14] the kind of garment that's offered and
[1:13:16] to the leodan church age amen Is His
[1:13:19] Garment a white garment that'll cover
[1:13:21] the shame of your nakedness why because
[1:13:23] he can't receive that bride and until
[1:13:25] she's been restored to a condition of
[1:13:27] innocency he can't take her in
[1:13:29] perversion so he must provide for her a
[1:13:33] garment and he provided it in the
[1:13:36] message of the
[1:13:37] hour it is the wedding garment
[1:13:40] friends amen right there's so many like
[1:13:44] I said so many terms that that the
[1:13:46] prophet of God uses your feeding on the
[1:13:49] body word of the son of man the bleeding
[1:13:51] bloody word and and and and and they
[1:13:54] they they're bringing him from the old
[1:13:56] Pascal lamb to the true atonement the
[1:13:58] word he uses all of these things and it
[1:14:00] can be so confusing because we've never
[1:14:01] heard preachers preach like that but
[1:14:03] when you catch what he's saying he's
[1:14:05] saying the same thing over and over and
[1:14:07] over again amen the blood represents the
[1:14:09] life the life is back because the word's
[1:14:11] comeing back it's a fresh kill of the
[1:14:13] word for our day it's got life in it
[1:14:15] it's got blood in it it'll cover us
[1:14:17] cleanse us make us ready for the union
[1:14:20] with Christ and what is it it's the
[1:14:23] message because the message is Christ
[1:14:25] not books and tapes but Jesus Christ the
[1:14:28] word that's been restored back to the
[1:14:29] bride and what is she supposed to do to
[1:14:32] make herself ready she's got to
[1:14:33] straighten up and quit chewing gum in
[1:14:35] church and start dressing no all she's
[1:14:37] got to do is let the prophet put the
[1:14:40] clothing on her and stay in
[1:14:43] it it's that easy friends it's not
[1:14:46] complicated it's not hard what did Adam
[1:14:48] have to do Adam tried he failed what has
[1:14:51] the bride done for 2,000 years tried and
[1:14:53] failed tried and failed tried and fail F
[1:14:55] all kinds of different stitching that
[1:14:57] that fig Leaf garment didn't work maybe
[1:14:59] we'll sew it this
[1:15:03] way well that didn't work that
[1:15:05] denomination if we had a split in that
[1:15:07] denomination okay all right you're using
[1:15:09] the Fig leaves inside out let's flip
[1:15:10] them around now let's try stitching it
[1:15:12] that way that's what's been happening
[1:15:14] for 2,000 years as man keeps trying to
[1:15:16] modify the
[1:15:18] Garment but oh praise God in the end
[1:15:21] time he's got a white garment amen and
[1:15:23] he's provided it through the preaching
[1:15:25] of the word through a
[1:15:27] prophet and brother B when the crowning
[1:15:29] of his ministry be to clothe a
[1:15:32] bride and the Garment of the word what
[1:15:35] kind of word the bleeding bloody word
[1:15:38] the fresh kill of the word the word that
[1:15:40] still has life and blood and atonement
[1:15:43] in
[1:15:44] it that can cover your scarlet
[1:15:48] stains and the bride is just like
[1:15:52] Adam just like the woman oh the way back
[1:15:55] in
[1:15:56] Genesis hopeless and without a hope in
[1:15:59] the world yes right lost is lost can be
[1:16:04] destroyed perverted corrupted with
[1:16:07] irreversible
[1:16:10] damage but God
[1:16:13] came but God
[1:16:15] came how are we in this age the same
[1:16:18] spot amen covered in fig leafes of
[1:16:21] religion it wasn't working but God came
[1:16:25] amen and God provided a lamb and God
[1:16:28] provided a word and God provided the
[1:16:30] life and God gave the Garment amen
[1:16:34] amen you know what Adam had to
[1:16:37] do all he had to do was stand there and
[1:16:40] let God put the coat on
[1:16:42] him amen he didn't have to sew it Stitch
[1:16:46] It slay the lamb he didn't have to do
[1:16:49] anything he just had to let God put it
[1:16:52] on him
[1:16:55] and then his responsibility you know
[1:16:56] what his part is not to take it
[1:17:02] off God's in partnership with man God
[1:17:04] never takes away free moral
[1:17:06] agency what was Adam's part of the whole
[1:17:09] deal to stand and be clothed in the coat
[1:17:12] of
[1:17:14] innocency and then to walk in it and not

[1:18:40] righteousness and I'm clothed in his
[1:18:43] white garment and I'm covered in his
[1:18:47] innocency Adam was guilty condemned to
[1:18:50] die what he needed was innocency and he
[1:18:53] had to get innocent y from an innocent
[1:18:57] victim and God provided the innocent
[1:19:00] victim and that innocent victim became
[1:19:02] guilty instead of Adam so Adam could
[1:19:05] have his innocency yeah amen oh praise
[1:19:08] God Jesus Christ came and took my sin
[1:19:11] upon himself he became guilty he became
[1:19:13] the sinner he bore the sins of the world
[1:19:15] and the full brunt of God's judgment why
[1:19:17] so that he could give his innocency to
[1:19:19] me so that I could come to him in Purity
[1:19:22] and innocency and and CLE cleanliness

[1:19:30] a word so that he could marry a bride in
[1:19:31] this age he couldn't come to the
[1:19:33] marriage Union when the Garment was
[1:19:35] partial when the spots were still
[1:19:36] showing through denominationalism when
[1:19:38] they had partial truth he had to come to
[1:19:40] where he could fully restore the entire
[1:19:42] garment which is Jesus Christ the full
[1:19:45] word of God has come back in this day
[1:19:48] and there's been a prophet here to

[1:20:11] on stay in it stay under the water let
[1:20:15] him keep washing let him keep clothing
[1:20:18] let him keep covering our spots with the
[1:20:20] word let him keep adorning the way he

[1:20:25] adorned let him decide where the Garment
[1:20:29] goes and how much is

[1:21:44] it back we can see the elements ready to
[1:21:47] bring the church into the presence of
[1:21:48] Christ we can see the bride taking on
[1:21:50] the form putting the wedding garment on
[1:21:53] making ready we can see the lights of
[1:21:55] flickering we know that we're at the
[1:21:59] end praise God and birth pains brother B
[1:22:03] says the Bible said his wife has made
[1:22:07] herself ready at the End of the Age how
[1:22:10] did she make herself
[1:22:12] ready I love I love when the prophet

[1:22:23] to make herself ready
[1:22:25] you got to ship up Shape Up get this
[1:22:27] done and Nip Tuck
[1:22:30] and we have all kinds of ideas when it
[1:22:32] means to make herself
[1:22:33] ready Pro says how did she make herself
[1:22:36] ready to become his wife and what does
[1:22:40] she what kind of garment she had on his
[1:22:43] own
[1:22:45] word she was dressed in his
[1:22:49] righteousness yes that's what it is
[1:22:52] right how did she make yourself ready
[1:22:55] what do we have to do to make ourselves
[1:22:56] ready just put the word
[1:22:59] on just wear
[1:23:01] it don't listen to it put it
[1:23:05] on don't just agree with it let it
[1:23:08] become your
[1:23:10] garment amen fit into the Garment of the
[1:23:17] word let God clothe us with his
[1:23:22] righteousness
[1:23:24] this whole idea of naked and clothed it
[1:23:27] it it goes all the way through the
[1:23:30] Bible but what are we going to be
[1:23:32] clothed with in the end time we're going
[1:23:33] to be clothed with
[1:23:35] Christ we're going to be clothed with
[1:23:37] the life the atonement the
[1:23:41] purification why why
[1:23:44] now because now is the time of the
[1:23:48] wedding we're going to the wedding
[1:23:49] supper but the wedding's taking place
[1:23:51] here and what is he doing in the wedding
[1:23:53] time he's got to restore store a bride
[1:23:55] to innocency so he can take a bride to
[1:23:56] himself the perfect bridegroom has to
[1:23:59] have a perfect
[1:24:00] bride but the bride can't be perfect on
[1:24:03] her own so he has to provide something
[1:24:05] to make her
[1:24:07] perfect so he sent a messenger he sent a
[1:24:10] Chamberlain he sent a Hagi he sent a
[1:24:12] brother brandom he sent a seventh angel
[1:24:15] he sent a man in this day amen that
[1:24:17] could that could bring out the water of
[1:24:19] washing of the word amen so that she
[1:24:21] could be washed and purified in the word
[1:24:23] and he brought out the Garment so that
[1:24:25] she be clothed in the right
[1:24:27] garment and what does she have to do the
[1:24:30] same thing Adam did just let it be put
[1:24:34] on and just wear it amen I want to be
[1:24:38] clothed in his
[1:24:40] righteousness what is his righteousness
[1:24:43] his word what declares me
[1:24:46] righteous what makes you righteous what
[1:24:48] makes me righteous what makes anybody
[1:24:50] righteous the same thing that made
[1:24:52] Abraham righteous amen
[1:24:55] Abraham was declared righteous and then
[1:24:56] tried to sell his wife
[1:24:59] out how's that make
[1:25:01] sense what makes what what is that
[1:25:04] righteousness it's his
[1:25:06] righteousness how what is my
[1:25:08] righteousness my righteousness is his
[1:25:11] righteousness how do I get his
[1:25:13] righteousness well he puts his
[1:25:14] righteousness on
[1:25:16] me why does he put his righteousness on
[1:25:19] me because I believe his
[1:25:21] word it's that simple
[1:25:25] you know believing is not straining
[1:25:27] believing is not a brain
[1:25:31] cramp I don't understand this I don't
[1:25:33] know how to that's not
[1:25:35] believing faith is a gift that God gives
[1:25:38] it's not of yourselves it's a gift of
[1:25:39] God it's something inside of you that
[1:25:42] can just say truth truth truth I don't
[1:25:45] get it but it's true I don't know that I
[1:25:47] measure up but it's true I don't know
[1:25:48] how to measure it but it's still true
[1:25:51] it's a gift of God and that gift of
[1:25:53] God's been given to us and when that
[1:25:54] gift goes into exercising and then all a
[1:25:56] sudden there's a confession and there's
[1:25:57] a faith that believes then God imputes
[1:25:59] unto us his very own
[1:26:03] righteousness and God brings us back to
[1:26:07] innocency not because I'm
[1:26:11] innocent but because he's put his
[1:26:13] innocency over top of me and I'm clothed
[1:26:16] in his innocency the same Adam was
[1:26:18] clothed in the innocency of that lamb
[1:26:21] and now we're clothed in the Purity the
[1:26:24] thoughtlessness the innocency of this
[1:26:27] pure word which is Christ
[1:26:30] himself that's why brother brandom at
[1:26:32] the end of his ministry said you're the
[1:26:34] sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:26:37] Christ you never did it to begin with
[1:26:39] it's not even in God's mind it's put out
[1:26:41] of his remember it's all together you
[1:26:43] have no
[1:26:46] spot because red through red looks
[1:26:51] white I'm so thankful God sent us this
[1:26:53] message friend
[1:26:55] what were we going to do if God didn't
[1:26:57] come in the cool of the evening if he
[1:26:59] didn't provide the Garment what would
[1:27:01] Adam do what would we do nothing we
[1:27:03] could do friends you and I would be
[1:27:05] doing the same thing everybody else is
[1:27:07] doing we would be going Hog Wild for
[1:27:09] ourselves and for the world or we'd be
[1:27:11] stitching together another kind of fig
[1:27:15] Leaf but this message is love and grace
[1:27:18] and Purity and this is innocency
[1:27:20] restored to a bride who's been Fallen
[1:27:24] not mine but
[1:27:27] his one of the things I think we
[1:27:29] struggle with more than anything is a
[1:27:32] lack of
[1:27:33] confidence because we've been taught to
[1:27:35] be
[1:27:37] self-confident and to be confident means
[1:27:39] to be
[1:27:40] self-confident but I don't think
[1:27:42] self-confidence is going to do us a bit
[1:27:43] of
[1:27:44] good but nonetheless we should be the
[1:27:47] most confident people on the face of the
[1:27:49] Earth but not
[1:27:51] self-confident because it's not me it's
[1:27:53] not my faith not my righteous not my
[1:27:55] garment not my word yeah that's right
[1:27:58] amen but I am confident that that word
[1:28:01] is pure and I'm confident that that's
[1:28:03] Christ and I'm confident that it's right
[1:28:05] and I'm confident the word is pure and
[1:28:07] I'm confident that I believe
[1:28:09] it amen so I'm confident that he's
[1:28:12] washing me in the word that he's
[1:28:13] clothing me in the word and that I stand
[1:28:15] before him the same way brother Brenham
[1:28:17] said the bride stands not because I done
[1:28:20] anything right or anything to justify
[1:28:22] but simply because I had something in me
[1:28:24] that could say that's nothing but the
[1:28:27] truth we should be able to stand in
[1:28:29] confidence when we Face obstacles
[1:28:31] confidence when we have disaster
[1:28:33] confidence when we fail
[1:28:35] ourselves and say I'm not much but this
[1:28:39] word is
[1:28:41] everything I may fail but this never
[1:28:43] will I may make a mistake but his
[1:28:45] promise is never going to be a
[1:28:47] mistake and how do I know it's mine not
[1:28:50] because I can prove it not because I
[1:28:53] have a certificate
[1:28:55] they even asked brother brandham I I
[1:28:56] don't have the quote so I'm just going
[1:28:58] by memory I might have a little wrong
[1:28:59] they said brother BR can you prove or do
[1:29:01] you know for sure that that that you're
[1:29:03] you're one of them or you're born again
[1:29:04] or something like that and he says
[1:29:08] no there's no way to prove
[1:29:10] it he said but I believe it by
[1:29:14] faith faith is the substance of things
[1:29:16] hoped for faith is the reality faith is
[1:29:20] what's
[1:29:21] true we sometimes try to make good works
[1:29:25] and a testimony of our faith listen good
[1:29:28] works will come don't worry about it but
[1:29:31] you're not always going to do good
[1:29:34] works but our confidence needs to be in
[1:29:36] this wedding garment that he's put on us
[1:29:39] and I'm wearing it you know what I'm
[1:29:41] still a little clumsy in
[1:29:43] it it's still tight in some spots and
[1:29:46] loose in the other I know I've got to
[1:29:47] grow into this garment but I've Got
[1:29:49] Confidence in the Garment not in me I
[1:29:52] know that it's covering me me I know
[1:29:54] that it's purifying me I know that he's
[1:29:56] looking at the Garment of the word and
[1:29:58] he's declaring me sinless spotless
[1:30:01] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ no matter
[1:30:03] how messed up I am on the inside red
[1:30:05] through red looks white to
[1:30:08] him God knows he's going to change that
[1:30:11] corruption into incorruption someday and
[1:30:13] this old body of mine's going to drop
[1:30:15] and I'm going to take another robe
[1:30:19] yeah in Corinthians Paul talks about
[1:30:22] that your soul amen you grown to be
[1:30:24] clothed yes clothed upon so that you
[1:30:28] won't be found naked what's Paul talking
[1:30:31] about your soul amen longs to be clothed
[1:30:34] but not with corruption your soul longs
[1:30:36] to be clothed with incorruption which is
[1:30:38] your inheritance in the heavens which is
[1:30:40] pure and ly white which is your
[1:30:41] theophany which never sin in the first
[1:30:43] place and when you leave this earth less
[1:30:46] what you get a white robe and that white
[1:30:49] robe is your theophany they're waiting
[1:30:51] for you and if you have a white robe
[1:30:53] there that means you're predestinated
[1:30:55] Amen to go and wear that Lily white robe
[1:30:58] of your
[1:30:59] theophany and if he's predestinated if
[1:31:01] you've got a theophany there then he's
[1:31:03] got a garment for you to wear
[1:31:05] here that'll purify you and take you
[1:31:09] there I'm so
[1:31:11] thankful that we have a white
[1:31:14] garment that'll cover the shame of our
[1:31:17] nakedness thank god let's all Stand
[1:31:21] Together musicians if you'll come
[1:31:28] I just want to read to you one scripture
[1:31:30] as we're standing as the musicians come
[1:31:32] it's out of Revelation
[1:31:34] 19 It's the Return of Christ on a white
[1:31:37] horse in Revelation 1911 he says I saw
[1:31:40] heaven open and behold a white horse and
[1:31:42] he that sat upon him was called faithful
[1:31:45] and true and in righteousness he that
[1:31:47] judge and make war his eyes were as a
[1:31:49] flame of fire and on his head were many
[1:31:50] crowns and he had a name written that no
[1:31:53] man knew but he himself and he was
[1:31:55] clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood
[1:31:57] and his name is called the word of
[1:32:00] God and the armies which were in heaven
[1:32:02] followed him upon white horses clothed
[1:32:05] in fine linen white and
[1:32:09] clean brother bam tells us that the Book
[1:32:12] of Revelation is a book of
[1:32:15] symbols is that
[1:32:17] right I don't know what kind of garments
[1:32:20] we'll wear in the Millennium we may all
[1:32:21] wear white robes every single day of our
[1:32:23] lives or we might have different kinds
[1:32:25] of garments depending on the task that
[1:32:27] we're assigned to I don't know but I
[1:32:30] know that this is symbolic because
[1:32:32] Revelation is a book of
[1:32:34] symbols and when we come back with
[1:32:36] Christ and return we won't be spotted
[1:32:41] anymore because we will be clothed in
[1:32:44] fine linen white and
[1:32:47] clean you know this is not
[1:32:50] me this is only a garment that I'm
[1:32:52] wearing yeah and this garment is spotted
[1:32:55] because of
[1:32:56] perversion because of the fall in the
[1:32:58] garden so God has a spiritual Veil to
[1:33:01] Veil over this spotted garment and that
[1:33:04] Veil is
[1:33:07] himself that's him we put on
[1:33:10] Christ but there's going to come a day
[1:33:12] when I'm going to get another Veil for
[1:33:15] my soul Amen to come back in a glorified
[1:33:18] body with my theophany with my soul and
[1:33:21] a glorified body and I will be clothed
[1:33:24] the real me that's down on the inside
[1:33:26] that's now clothed in perversion is
[1:33:28] going to one day be clothed in
[1:33:29] Perfection when God brings me back to a
[1:33:31] glorified
[1:33:34] body and I will return to this earth in
[1:33:37] the
[1:33:38] Millennium clothed and white
[1:33:42] linen white and
[1:33:44] clean no more perversion no more
[1:33:48] corruption no more
[1:33:51] hybridization we're going to be clothed
[1:33:53] yeah forever and linens white and clean
[1:33:58] amen God bless you all let's bow our
[1:34:00] heads and thank God for his
[1:34:02] word Lord Jesus I thank you for your
[1:34:06] word God we can't
[1:34:09] fathom we can't fathom the privilege
[1:34:12] that we
[1:34:13] have I don't know there's any way to
[1:34:16] express it Lord the way it's in my
[1:34:18] heart how we are most the most
[1:34:20] privileged people that have ever been on
[1:34:22] the face of the Earth
[1:34:25] God you unveil yourself and unveil
[1:34:28] yourself and unveil yourself
[1:34:31] again and you show us Lord things that
[1:34:34] we've

[1:34:38] full color time and time
[1:34:41] again how encouraging it is to know Lord
[1:34:45] that you've done for us in this age the
[1:34:47] same thing you did for Adam when he
[1:34:50] fell so thankful Lord to know that
[1:34:52] you've sent us a garment a wedding
[1:34:55] garment that's not

[1:35:56] generation every effort of mine has
[1:35:59] equal

[1:36:05] humiliation but Lord you've come in this
[1:36:07] generation the same as you
[1:36:09] did to
[1:36:12] Adam and you've restored to us a garment
[1:36:15] Lord a garment that the church was
[1:36:17] supposed to have and wear and put on and
[1:36:19] grow but she began to change it she
[1:36:24] began to adapt it and add to it and take
[1:36:26] away from
[1:36:27] it God in the end time you've brought
[1:36:30] the Garment back you brought the life
