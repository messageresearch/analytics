you know when when uh when job was here God actually set up that trial for job it was not it was not Satan that did that that was God that did that he's going Satan have you considered my servant job you know we be thinking the Lord should be protecting him keeping Satan away and that's what Satan said you are keeping me away he said no no no come and have a look there's no one like him in the land god starts bragging on job he he starts he starts needling the devil about job he's such a great man there's no one in the earth like him so Satan he says you can Satan says well I can't get to him God says you can but don't take his life but God sets it up this way because as job was a great man and God was impressed with job but God said I can make him greater I can make him twice what he is by by giving him a trial that he becomes an overcomer and job was twice the man that he was at the beginning and right now the Lord is bragging on his bride he is behind the scenes he and Satan are having a conversation he's bragging on you sometimes that causes our trials he's making something beautiful out of your life yeah that's true and I heard somebody say this too and I I can identify with it being true if you had a choice of all the different trials that that are available which ones would you pick would you pick brother so and so's trials brother sister so and so's trials all you'd pick your own trials so leukemia would you choose that well I'm on the other side of that now so you say praise the Lord I'm glad that I've been through that experience and he delivered me I'm glad to have that on my record he's the delivering God you know when I was I was lying in hospital and only certain simple scriptures could come to me I couldn't think too well or pumping me full of drugs and things but Romans 8:28 just stood out all things work together for the good all things and I thought that all things that means right now all things and I got myself up out of the bed I was there by myself in the isolated room for 7 weeks and I stood up I said Thank You Lord all things it means that right now this is for my good tears running down my face and the presence of the Lord just came down in the room and when my wife came back in I said I'm going to be well presence of the Lord's been here all things are working together for good he wants to hear his bride quoting his word amen that's just that's what it's all about
