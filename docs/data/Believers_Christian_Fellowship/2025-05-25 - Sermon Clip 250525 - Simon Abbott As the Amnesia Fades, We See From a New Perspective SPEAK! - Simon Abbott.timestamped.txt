[0:00] Amnesia, just the smallest little
[0:02] something, a little glimpse of something
[0:04] and it triggers a memory. And sometimes
[0:07] that's how it is. And the amnesia starts
[0:09] to lift from off of us. You know,
[0:11] brother Ron talks about the soldier. He
[0:13] talks about the soldier. I'm not going
[0:14] to read it. I'll just paraphrase it. So,
[0:15] so brother talks about the soldier and
[0:18] he's he's shell shocked. He comes back.
[0:20] He's on the train and the soldiers, they
[0:22] let him out for a little stretch of the
[0:23] legs or whatever. And the guy sits there
[0:25] and he looks at the starts looking
[0:26] around and he starts scratching his face
[0:28] and watching and he sees the water tower
[0:30] and he's like looking at the water tower
[0:32] and then he he starts walking and and
[0:34] the soldiers they kind of watch him from
[0:35] a distance and let him go and and he he
[0:37] follows a path around and he goes around
[0:39] this path and brother tells a story goes
[0:41] around the back and over the back of a
[0:42] hill or something and there is a house
[0:45] and there is his father who's waiting
[0:47] for him and the father says I always
[0:50] knew you'd come back to me and so on and
[0:53] so forth. So for this soldier that was
[0:55] lost, the memory that was triggered, it
[0:57] was a water
[0:59] tower. And when we hear the word of God
[1:02] preached, we can't explain it. Just like
[1:05] the soldier, he at that point in time,
[1:07] he would not have been able to explain
[1:08] it. See, the soldier at this point in
[1:11] time when he sees the water tower, don't
[1:13] forget when we first heard the message,
[1:16] something said, "Yeah, that that's it."
[1:18] Yeah. But we still didn't know who we
[1:21] were. Yeah, we didn't know our identity.
[1:25] This soldier boy, he's there. He sees
[1:27] the water tower. Something inside him is
[1:29] tugging on his heart, but he still
[1:31] doesn't know his identity. He walks
[1:34] around the path with every footstep he's
[1:37] taking. The amnesia is fading, but he
[1:40] still doesn't know his identity. He
[1:42] comes face to face with his father.
[1:46] He still doesn't know his identity. It
[1:49] takes the father to identify the son.
[1:52] See, we don't always just like, okay, I
[1:55] heard the message and boom, that was it.
[1:58] Really? Nice testimony. Next story. No,
[2:01] no, no. We heard the message. Something
[2:03] inside us is like, mate, there's
[2:05] something there.
[2:08] But it was just something there. And we
[2:11] go further. We go further until
[2:13] eventually we get there. We see through
[2:14] a glass darkly. Then face to face,
[2:17] suddenly we're seeing, mate, mama,
[2:19] that's me. See what I mean? We're going
[2:21] up these steps of life
[2:23] and by faith we walk. We hear something
[2:27] familiar. It wasn't a water tower. It
[2:28] was maybe something else. But we hear
[2:30] something familiar and by faith we just
[2:32] keep walking down this little path. We
[2:35] don't know where it's going to end. Did
[2:36] anybody in here know that they would end
[2:39] up sitting in this chair when they were
[2:41] like 12? Anybody? Any hands? No. No.
[2:46] See, so but you're walking by faith. But
[2:48] you end where you end up is in front of
[2:50] the father and it's the voice behind the
[2:53] voice
[2:56] that's actually calling out to you and
[2:59] identifying you. The the scream from the
[3:02] eagle was the
[3:04] identification of who he was going to be
[3:07] when he reached maturity. Here's a man.
