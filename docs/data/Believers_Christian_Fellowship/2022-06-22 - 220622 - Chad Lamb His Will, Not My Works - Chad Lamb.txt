we ask you to bless this service now for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you all while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn if you will to john chapter 19 say god bless you sister karen it's good to see you feeling good amen and brother les it's good to see you here i'm glad you're feeling better man god is good amen um i just wanted to let you know we're gonna have a visiting minister on sunday i hadn't really planned it that way and i wouldn't normally schedule somebody in after having so many visiting ministers and being away myself but i just learned that gabriel matagne from romania is in the country contacting me this week and said that he could he'd like to extend his trip he wanted to come by and see us brother gabriel's a pastor in romania and he's the one who organized the camp that we went and ministered at i don't know maybe four or five years ago and i was supposed to be there for easter and i believe it was 2020 got cancelled by cove but i was supposed to be there in september of 2021 was canceled by covet and so we've been supposed to connect for quite a bit but he's here in the states and he's a fine brother very active in the ministry very active and spreading the message through romania and so he'll be here sunday and i've asked him to take the service so he'll be preaching for us so be praying for that and be praying for him so it's something that just came up and and so i'm looking forward to seeing him again also one of the deacons told me we have visitors from tucson brother juan sister anna gonzalez and their family god bless you it's good to have you you're very welcome amen and we'll hopefully get a chance to shake your hand after service amen let's look now at john chapter 19 while we're standing we'll read this one scripture then take our seats john chapter 19 verse 16 then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took jesus and led him away before we have our seats i'd like to read one other scripture in luke luke 23 we just turn back to that quickly luke 23 and we're going to read part of this verse verse 33 luke 23 and verse 33 and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him man you may take your seats and god bless us as we look at his word amen when we look at these two scriptures it says that pilate he's referring to pilate in john 19 then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took jesus and led him away and then the scripture we're looking at now it says they they come to the place which is called calvary and there they crucified him we know these four words are very important brother brenham first addresses this in the second seal but then he really elaborates on it in the indictment it says there amen the most holy place jerusalem they the most holy people god's chosen people crucified the most cruel form of capital punishment him the most precious person jesus christ so brother venom takes and lays out the indictment based on this scripture and those four words amen there they crucified him but i'm not really wanting to go into that into the indictment but i just want to take a look at something that's been on my heart i expressed it to a couple brothers on sunday after the service and so this will tie in with sunday but i want to continue with a little bit different thought amen and we know sunday we were talking about the value of the word and and i'd like to just say i don't know that we could ever value enough the word that we have you know we took that statement brother bam said i wonder if um oh i can't remember what it said amen what was it brother praise god i wonder if we are sufficiently i want i know i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst amen praise god i'm glad some people have good fresh memories and they're still young sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst amen i don't think we can ever be impressed enough i don't think we could ever value it enough amen it is the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to mankind for god to open what was a mystery in the back part of his mind and whispered his love secrets to his bride amen i don't know that we ever i don't know what ever come to the end of how amazing that is i don't know that we'll ever discover how wonderful that is amen until we get out of here i don't know but we should give everything to that amen and so now i you know i was thinking on that thought and and then moving from that some things that i've been meditating on and i want to read just a a a statement brother bennett makes here a god's word calls for total separation from unbelief it says then we rebuke satan and all his powers of darkness amen he's at the end of the service here and he says all of his powers of unbelief the spirit of god has raised up a standard against you satan you are a defeated being jesus christ defeated you at calvary i just wanted to read that last statement jesus christ defeated you at calvary brother bennett makes this statement multiple times through multiple uh um sermons he preaches he says many times that satan was defeated at calvary and he when he and he's rebuking the devil many times in a prayer line of praying over people and he's rebuking the devil and casting them out and saying you were defeated at calvary and and we began to look i began to think about the devil being defeated at calvary and i started meditating on this thought and and thinking that at calvary if you'll just not get too stumbled of what i'm about to say but at calvary jesus didn't do anything at calvary jesus had no works no works of his own he extended no effort he didn't do anything there were no miracles there was there was not there was no effort there was no work there was there was no demonstration there was no manifestation there was no preaching one of the greatest victories mankind has ever experienced was calvary the price of redemption was paid at calvary the victory over hybridization was paid for amen was won at calvary amen i don't know that we can ever be thankful enough for calvary for the shedding of that pure blood as an atonement for my sins as a substitute for me amen he took my place at calvary but when it comes to calvary amen it wasn't what jesus did there was nothing he did it's what he surrendered himself to it wasn't a work amen calvary wasn't works amen calvary wasn't effort calvary wasn't ministry calvary wasn't manifestations amen calvary amen was one man totally in control of god amen one person who would completely submit to the will of god amen brought forth the calvary it wasn't what he did it's what he surrendered to amen that brought calvary and remember jesus as our example in everything amen so when we look at the greatest victory the greatest victory came oh i'm going to say things that sound bad but they're not bad they're good the greatest victory came with the least amount of personal effort because it wasn't what he did there they took him and they crucified him there they crucified him he didn't crucify himself amen he didn't scorch himself amen to pay for our sicknesses by his stripes amen it says by his stripes we are healed but he didn't lay the stripes on himself others did it to him amen there he shed his blood but he didn't prick himself he didn't nail himself to the cross he didn't crucify himself he didn't condemn himself to die he didn't pass the judgment he didn't do the works all he did was surrender to god in gethsemane amen and others took him and crucified him it wasn't what he did it's what he surrendered himself to and if that brought the greatest victory to mankind the shedding of blood amen what will bring this greatest victory in the final act of redemption to bring a change in the body what is it that we can do amen what is it this is my whole thought amen is not his will not my works we get so i i find that there there's so many times brother bam said man has always tried to have something to do with it amen that's the failure of mankind that's the failure of denominationalism that was the failure in exodus 19. it's been the failure all along that man wants to put his effort towards something but every time man puts his effort towards something he ruins it amen and it's god it doesn't want us to put our effort towards something he wants us to surrender to something and it was his will now now don't don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have any effort we do the word of god we sacrifice we give up we we obey we do what he called us to do but at the end of the day what can you do amen what what work are you able to work what thing what can you do what power do you have what will your little hands and your little body what will it do they meant nothing but surrender to the will of god it's the will of god that'll bring the victory remember jesus is our example he goes to win the battle he goes to bring victory he goes to release us from bondage he goes to to break the power of the enemy by hybridization he goes to shed his precious blood amen as a perfect slain lamb to free us from the curse and there's nothing he can do there's nothing he can add to it there's no effort he can put into it he just has to completely surrender and let god do what god already ordained that god would do he wouldn't even speak at his trial you think of the wisdom of solomon but he said a greater than solomon is here the wisest of the wisest was standing there on trial amen and the trial was a dog and pony show and it was an absolute ridiculous trial and do you think that jesus with a few phrases couldn't have unraveled the whole thing he couldn't have made pilate ashamed of himself he couldn't make canvases in the high priest tucked their tails and those who were speaking against him run away and hide with just a few phrases he could have discerned the whole thing he had more wisdom than solomon had amen a greater than solomon was standing on trial amen and it wasn't his wisdom that was going to win the day it wasn't words it wasn't discernment it wasn't anything that was going to win the victory he had to close his mouth and completely surrender and let god do it amen this was god's victory man this was god's doing amen but god couldn't do it without a human being god has so set his plan that he doesn't do anything without you and i he needs a man to work through amen but he didn't need this man to do anything he needed this man to say thy will be done not mine [Music] that's the kind of man he needed for the greatest victory amen for the for the destruction of satan for the overcoming amen of the fall he needed a man that wouldn't put his own effort into it amen wouldn't use his own mind that wouldn't even use his gifts for the greatest victory he needed a man that will stand and be quiet and surrender and let god have his way amen brother bam tells us he could have called for legions of angels to deliver him he said brother man quoted billy sunday and he said the trees at calvary were full of angels waiting for him to just twitch his finger he had power to deliver himself he had gifts amen to deliver himself he had he had the ability a man to do all manner of things but he didn't do anything he did nothing he did nothing nothing nothing but completely yield to the will of god i'd like to take his example god help us to take his example we we sometimes feel such a pressure to produce something to do something that that i have to do something as if god needs my help god needs my effort god doesn't need my help he needs my surrender amen god can't work his program without you and i that's absolutely the truth but he's not depending on your brain he doesn't need your thoughts he doesn't need he doesn't need your intellect he doesn't need your smooth charisma he doesn't need your gifts what he needs is you amen jesus says in john chapter 5 let's turn to john chapter 5 together this is such a lesson that we can take you know how brother bam tells us that in jesus temptation in the wilderness he had all gifts but he didn't use any of his gifts to overcome the devil he used he used it is written he had all gifts all knowledge all understanding all power he had all abilities he could have he could have done anything amen as far as a demonstrative a gift or a power or manifestation amen but he used none of his gifts to overcome the devil amen all he used was the word he said it is written and brother bam said he put amen that in the in the hands of the weakest christian the ability to overcome the devil because we can take the same thing that jesus took whether we have gifts or don't have gifts or or whatever we can take it is written and it is written we'll defeat the devil any place anytime under any condition so jesus became our example although he could do all things although he had all power all he had all manifestations he had all gifts he used none of them to overcome the devil to be our example and so when he comes to calvary he is still our example amen so he uses no gifts he uses no power he uses no no nothing he just surrenders john chapter 5 and verse 30. he says i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not my own will but the will of the father which has sent me i can do nothing of myself this is jesus christ the virgin-born son of god perfect in all ways and he said i can do nothing of myself but he says as i hear i judge and my judgment is just he's confident in his judgment not because of himself but because he says what the father says as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not my own will but the will of the father which hath sent me remember jesus is our example amen and if we if we are going to be like christ amen christ came and lived alive to set an example for us to follow because as we come to the end time we must be so much like him that we will be him we will be in his very image amen that we will become he was the word made flesh we are becoming the word made flesh amen so we must reflect this same kind of life he was a messiah we're messiahs amen he is jesus christ we're mrs jesus christ so we've got to come to the same kind of a life amen that jesus lived amen i i think what i've been meditating on uh what what i've been dealing with in myself and meditating on is sometimes i get so troubled by the level of arrogance i see in in people who believe that the bride of jesus christ find it myself sometimes and it's shameful like we can do something and we've got this and we've got that and no devil and blah blah blah blah blah and there's true promises and there's true things but what i want more than anything is not to pound my chest and tote my position and how wonderful i want to be like jesus christ i can do nothing in myself amen the only thing that i have is this word that's been given to me which is everything and i can take this word and defeat the devil i can't defeat the devil but i can take this word and this word will defeat the devil it's not me it's the word the sword amen of the word amen we'll drive back the devil and because we've been given such a pure word and that word is powerful and if we take it by faith amen that word will win the victory all the time we have to be careful and stop thinking that we're winning the victory and we're the strong ones amen it's not us it's the word amen it's the word that's been restored it's the word that's been given and because we have so much victory by faith in the word we become proud we become uh we we can be i'm not saying we are but we can become a little bit self-confident because we have victory upon victory pray for the sick and they're healed and deliverances and all the thing that's god doing for us he's doing it for us according to his word he's doing it because of his word he's doing it because we're taking his word the way the prophet told us to take a word but what if there was no prophet what if the word wasn't restored what if you were stuck in a methodist system amen what if you were stuck in some other system you would have no victory in your life you would have no deliverance you would be nothing it's the word that's giving us victory we've got to be careful that we don't start pinning badges on ourselves amen because of victories but we keep acknowledging i can do nothing of myself my judgment is just because i'm repeating what the prophet said i'm judging this situation correctly not because i'm wise but because i have ears to hear by the grace of god what a prophet said about this subject and i just take that and apply it here so my judgment is just because as i hear i judge [Music] but it's not because i'm all wise it's because i believe the word i've received the word by the grace of god and now that word will win the victory every time and sometimes when i hear these things in myself and on others and i say god help us amen let us come back to the example that's been given us and realize if we ever win this great victory over hybridization that's called the change of the body it will not be something you and i have done it will be something that we've surrendered ourselves to it'll be something that we've we've received by faith to the capacity to believe it and we will yield to it and god will do what god promised to do remember brother branham when he is given the power of the spoken word and the manifestation of the third pool and he creates squirrels and speaks to a storm and and all of these things there is a there's a question in questions and answers we've been through it before but i want to read it to you 1964 questions and answers this is august of 64. the question is this third pool is and is speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the rapture in the resurrection the son of man this is so or is it not and you would do this if properly pressed upon would you not escape not escape all these things escape all these things and stand before the son of man so now my dear friend see now i think there that you got you got a good statement yes sir yes sir brother ben's agreeing you can do that yes sir yes sir now that would be so you say brother branham in other words here's what i i i don't think that it's i believe not polishing enough what you said but i believe i can make it a little clearer to the people see you are believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here witnessed the squirrels and all those other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given i think that's the most important part of this we believe that that brother venom spoke and what he spoke manifested and came to exit he said let there be scrolls where he said the direction they would come from god did it exactly the way that man said but but listen to how he describes that because if not we start saying foolish things amen we start taking presumptions upon ourselves and start speaking to brothers brother i'm bright i give you that if you do it the way brother branham did you can do it now listen what he said he said that was sovereignly given [Music] i never asked him lord let me do this speak these things in like that do these things there i never asked him that he by his own divine will came to me and said you go do this [Music] see i wasn't asking one thing about it moses never asked to go down to egypt but was god that sent him down to egypt see now i believe that the holy spirit would come to me and say in a vision go tell a certain certain person that they're trying to overcome a certain thing and they cannot do it and they're smoking they're drinking they're lying stealing or committing adultery whatever it might be or they got lustful spirit and you just go where they are and say thou spirit come out of there i set the captive free would it take place absolutely yes indeed it absolutely would it take place but now upon my presuming now presume means to adventure without authority this is what happens when we start getting puffed up in ourselves and getting proud and this happens because god honors his word we believe the word of god we speak the word of god we do what the prophet told do and we get the results that god promised and then if we're not careful we begin to attach the results to our person and then that gives us a little courage to do a little presuming the next time and what's harder is if it actually works it gives us a little more courage to presume a little more and to take another step and before long amen we're not even led by the spirit of god we're being led by our own spirit our own desires our own wishes amen and and and that is the setup that'll take us off the word and bring an absolute collapse because god will not let his children continue their end presume means to venture without authority and i'd go down there to help this person i'm just presuming that it'd be all right then i don't know i can call the name of the lord over them i can pray for them do whatever i wish so there's nothing wrong with praying and praying in jesus name and praying the word but to pr to presume this is going to be this way brother and this is absolutely this and don't do that unless god tells you he said if i had my own ways this morning i just had an interview with this little lady sitting here in the wheelchair to come to this meeting today they had to have the fire department take her out of her house in chicago and people live across the street and don't come to the meeting see what would i do if it was my power if i i have the authority to do it but i have to wait for orders to do it i have the authority from god to do it but now when but now when he gives the orders she'd go back home well i know that is the truth i'd just be just as willing to die this morning on that as i'd be anything that's the truth but first you see it's all that no one even jesus himself the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father do that do with the son likewise we know that saint john 5 19 the son does nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that son will do likewise so we find out now that brother venom is telling us even with the spoken word speaking to a storm speaking god told him say what you want amen he didn't even tell him repeat this he put such a power and authority in a human being it's absolutely shocking that he would trust such power in a human being because whatever brother bam said is what would have been because god said it would be that way so he had he had confidence in the character of the man that he was talking to amen but brother bantam even though that happened to him on multiple occasions he would never presume and do that on his own he had so much respect for god and knew amen that that wasn't him that was gone if he just turned around and tried to speak another set of scrolls into existence without it being gone amen it wouldn't have happened it wasn't him and he knew by his own prison presuming he could bring damage to people so so even a gift like that was under the control of god and brother branham wouldn't take any credit for it now even when brother branham would begin to speak about that manifestation of the third pool he said this is how he said it god can create squirrels who created whose lips spoke the words brother branham's is that right but brother branham never said he created anything he always said god created squirrels and god made a squirrel and god created squirrels and god did in god he never took the credit upon himself he knew who had the power to create it wasn't him amen but god was honoring his words because god gave him the power and the authority and the time to do it and when he spoke god brought the squirrel to existence brother branham didn't bring that squirrel to existence god did but he honored the obedience of that prophet and he honored that prophet's faith so brother madam was good at keeping the categories right he was very good at keeping himself in position amen i i don't know what kind of human being i would be if god had trusted me with those kind of gifts and those kind of experiences amen to be able but brother bram said it it's amazing how god can give to man and he can stay a man and not become some superhuman or become a god to himself and that was brother branham and you wonder why god got somebody with such a difficult background with such a humble beginning with such a poor education and and and all of these things with no backing and no ability and rejection all through his life amen because god had to get somebody who could handle that kind of power and never become inflated in the self amen and give all glory to god and he did and i thank god for it in the message communion from 1957 brother bam says now if god did not spare his own son from the cruel testing then he will not spare you or i from cruel testings and jesus was here confronting the greatest test that he had ever had gethsemane laid just before him where that once and final all-sufficient test must come when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulders there was no one all heaven or earth could ever stood but him and to know that all of the sins of past and present and future sins rested upon this decision and it was one of the greatest victories that christ ever won or proved his great messiahship as when he said to god not my will thine be done i i love that sentence one of the greatest victories that christ ever won are proved his great messiahship was when he said to god not my will thine be done that was the greatest victory he'd ever won all the demons of torment was around to tempt him and try him gethsemane was jesus christ victory gethsemane is where he wrestled with his own desire in his own will amen versus the will of god amen he knew the will of god because he told him before the disciples what was going to happen so he knew the will of god but in gethsemane he's wrestling asking god if there's another way brother memphis said he didn't want to die being a man he didn't want to die he didn't want to leave the disciples he loved them all of these reasons he's asking god three times can this cup but pass me amen but his victory was in gethsemane when he says not my will but thy will be done that's where he won the battle that's where he labored that's where he worked the works of god that's where he overcame but when it came to calvary he didn't do anything he already won in gethsemane now god was going to take a surrendered vessel and allow demon forces anointed of evil to fulfill god's plan where now jesus isn't asked to scourge himself he's not asked to nail himself to a cross he's not asked to spit on himself or rip his beard out or beat himself he's not asked to do any of that all he had to do was surrender god did the rest and god took his lamb and turned it over to the authority of the high priest the high priest turned it over to rome amen rome then sacrificed the sacrifice of god amen and all he had to do to win that great victory was nothing was i surrendered god what do i have to do to win this great victory surrender surrender to what brother chad surrender to the word that has been given to us the apostle paul in multiple places in the scripture calls himself a prisoner of jesus christ paul the prisoner of jesus christ and we know this has a dual meaning he's actually imprisoned for the gospel and he's also imprisoned himself by by bonds of love to jesus christ he was a prisoner of jesus christ he goes on to say in galatians chapter 2 verse 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me he was a love slave to jesus christ he was bound to christ in chains of love he was a prisoner of jesus christ and he was crucified with christ's meaning he he gave up his own life amen his own mind his own will his own desire and we know this because the apostle paul tells us what he was aiming for and what what his accomplishments were and where he came from and what his zeal was all about but he gave all of it up amen to be a prisoner of jesus christ and to be crucified with christ and he said nevertheless i live but not i it's not me now living because paul's dead paul couldn't do anything now it's the life of jesus christ that's living in me it wasn't paul that won all those victories it was christ it wasn't paul amen it was christ working through paul brother mum says in the unfailing realities of the living god it says what can you give god will receive what you'll give but god wants all of you he wants every bit of you he wants all he wants everything you are he wants your life he wants your testimony he wants every minute you live he wants you to live right act right talk right do right he wants everything perfectly surrendered to him that he can lead you and guide you and put you into places where he wants you to go lead of the spirit you know what god's not looking for he's not looking for your great wisdom and that analysis and ability to analyze the world around you and figure out which is the best method to move forward what's the best thing to do amen uh what's the best thing to do uh with a job now let me look into the future and see how jobs are going all this is the best job to have and this is the best way to hedge myself against an economic downturn and this that's all your own intellect amen god will let that fail so that you don't get so comfortable in yourself amen because the children of god are to be led by the spirit of god not their intellect not their reasoning not their skill amen they're supposed to lay all that down and say god i want your leadership amen if i make the wrong decision if you lead me it's the right decision amen the worst time in the world to buy a house is when the market's high the best times when it's low unless god tells you to move then the best time to buy a house is when the market's high hey amen we got to get away from this whole idea of human ability got to get away with all this analytics and analyzing and reasoning and just say god i can't help myself on my best day i was a i i you know i almost use words you shouldn't use it in the pulpit i'll just say a big dummy the best i've ever been is a big dummy what i need is that divine leadership i need leadership in the word i need to know when to move what you want me to do how to do by your word amen not by analyzing not by uh listening to pundits not by all of this i mean we need to shut all of that off and say god i'm picking my foot up where do i put it down praise be to god brother banh said in the anointed ones at the end time and i just want you to catch the the attitude of the prophet so now i want you to know this is sure and you that listens to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself but that being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declared to do and i determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god here comes the prophet of god and he says you might have thought you might you could get the impression that i was talking about me because i'm the vessel amen that that the message is coming through but i have no more to do with it than nothing just a voice and it gives my better judgment i didn't even want to go this way god brought me this way it's not my doing it's all god's doings brother branham comes to the end of the seals preaching the seals and he says that was the most spiritual time of his ministry not miracles preaching the seals the opening of the word the third pool and he comes to the end of the seals and he says now don't say thank you to any man remember that he said now don't say thank you he wants the people to know this has nothing to do with me if it wasn't for him meeting in me in that room every day i'd have got every one of these seals wrong when he comes to the end of the seals don't come up and say well brother branham thank you for those messages brother bam says i didn't have anything to do with that that wasn't my mind that wasn't my ability to read the bible amen that wasn't my scholarly intellect from reading larkin and reading a white and all of these other he said i would have totally ruined the seals if he hadn't come and met me every day [Music] so when we get to the end of the don't say thank you brother brown thank god thank god so he's he's putting himself in the right place i think we need to keep ourselves in the right place let's turn to matthew chapter 7 together matthew chapter 7 verse 21. not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity that therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him into a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these things and mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall thereof the difference between the houses was not the material not the method of construction not the value of the material or how well they were put together the difference into those houses was one was founded on the word and one was not the one that fell could have been more valuable could have been better built with better material more costly goods it could have more conveniences amen amen it's just like our house you can have one house that's modest we could be one of us that's very modest in our ways we don't have many gifts we don't we're not endued with a lot of talent amen we can't sing we don't look good we're not a good speaker we don't have this that or the other amen we're just kind of um just there you know we just average joe then you can have another one among us i mean they can sing they can sing and play amen they can they're wise they're good at their work they're very skilled everything just falls into their hand one house is beautiful the other house is just average amen but it doesn't matter so much about the abilities amen what matters is the foundation what's underneath the one that's founded on the word will stand amen you can have ten to one gifts in the other one but if it's not based on the word that house that life is going to fall to ruin at some point it'll get off track and it'll collapse in the storms of life but you've got one house here one person that will withstand every storm that comes not not because of how well they're built the gifts and the abilities they have the material that's in them the genetics amen they're standing because they're on the rock amen and it's us we can stand when we're on the rock not how gifted we are or how much we do for the lord amen there's nothing else we can do for the lord but what he's purposed before for us to do so it's not the amount of works that are going to amount to anything it's the amount of surrender to the will of god that's going to win the day from the beginning of this passage we were reading in verse 21 he says many will come to me in that day and say lord lord have we not amen in the list of things that they claim to have done are amazing let's look at them verse 22 it says we have we not prophesied in thy name now listen i've said this many times before but it's worth noting again when you come to the white throne judgment nobody's lying nobody's standing nobody's at the white zone judgment trying to bluff god [Music] all right so nobody these statements are not untrue statements in fact it's through the fence they're making a defense at the white throne judgment before christ then they say lord have we not prophesied he's saying you know we prophesied and jesus never denies any of these claims have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and then thy name have done many wonderful works jesus wasn't impressed with the multitude of works he said depart from me ye that work iniquity iniquity is to know to do something and not do it see the deception they're standing in the white throne judgment they've deceived themselves they're pleading their case before the lord at the white throne judgment lord have we not you can't cast us away because we've prophesied in thy name we've cast out devils listen friends if you prophesy in his name and it comes to pass and you cast out devils and they go and you do many wonderful works it is easy for you to believe that you're okay is that right that's why it's a fallacy to look to manifestations and gifts as a justification amen is that right the charismatic world is full of them but it's not a justification it's not a declaration that you're a son of god man what declares me as the son of god what's my evidence of the new birth amen that i go all the way with the word amen with the word so here they listen i mean it's it's easy for self-deception when you prophesy in his name cast out devils and do many wonderful works but yet they were not fully obeying the word because it said depart from me ye that work iniquity iniquity is to transgress the law so they were not keeping the full word but had the boldness to plead their case to the lord of glory and say lord have we not this down they were deceived themselves they thought it was okay not to keep the full word and they looked at the signs and wonders as justification that they were fine with god even though they were transgressing the word i say god help us you know sometimes the blessings that we have in our life are not even because of us sometimes the blessings we have in our life are because of the previous generation brother ram told us that he talked to a man who was greatly blessed and and he said he says you seem to be blessed and the man said yeah i'm blessed don't even know why and he says because your parents were missionaries god has blessed you in business god is blessed so sometimes we look at our blessings and the things god does for us as proof that god loves us and that we're okay with god amen you're never okay with god unless you're standing on his word unless you're submitted to his word unless you're surrendered to his word so many of our blessings we think is because we're doing right and we don't know how many of his blessings is simply because the generation that was before us sacrificed for the word of god gave all for the word and now those blessings are pouring down to the next generation and we think it's because we're special people it wasn't because we're special people it's because the generation before sacrificed all for the word they were kicked out of churches they were laughed at and by their denomination and then they went without even having a church and starting home groups and all of that amen god blessed them in the generation below because of their sacrifices he said depart from me he didn't say depart from me you liars depart from me that work iniquity i said god help us more than anything i want to have the right perspective on the word i want to see the bible the way the bible's written not the way i feel about it not what generationally has been taught incorrect in denominationalism but i want to come back to the true revelation of the word and line my life up to that i want my security to come from a personal relationship with jesus christ the revealed word in this day and i want to see that he's given me the ability to surrender to the word and i don't want to be walking around with an iniquity knowing the prophet taught it this way but i'm ignoring that knowing that the word says this but look we're blessed god's still loving me god's still good to me amen don't you go one more day like that amen don't you step one step further like that if you know there's an iniquity in your life if you know there's something in your life not lining up to the message of the hour amen you say god forgive me for that and give me the power to line to that word don't look to your blessings and your good job in your home and your healings amen and say i'm fine with god you're not fine with god amen if there's iniquity there if you know to do something and you're not doing it amen don't go one day further thinking you're fine i warn you in the name of jesus christ this is your opportunity you could be blessed because of your parents you could be blessed because of your respect for the children of god you could be blessed because of your tithes and offerings but that still doesn't mean you're right brother branham says in the message one in a million he says let me give you a shocking something not all that saith unto me lord lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father his will is his word [Music] that's what jesus says this is he's reading right out of the scripture verse 21 not everyone that saith me lord lord shall enter in but he in the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father so how can i ensure that i will enter into the kingdom of heaven to do the will of the father what is the will of the father it is the word amen what word if you want to know what word it's the word that has been restored in this generation that has been given to us amen we don't talk about the message amen as a title for our group the message is the word of god that has been restored to us and it is subject to be lived by amen it is our commandments for life it is our instructions for pleasing the lord it is the word that has been unveiled in our day and the scriptures that have been restored in our lives amen it is everything to us it's not a title for a church it's not a title for a system of belief it is the word of god [Music] but he that doeth the will of my father his will is his word we can be ever so religious have great time shouting jumping in these meetings which i i don't want to be critical but i have a duty to to do to god and that duty is to be sincere and say what he wants me to say i'm certainly grateful for the california chapter who has bore with me in my convictions if i don't speak my convictions i'm a hypocrite and now i'm not even honest with you and if i can't be honest with you how will i how will i be honest with god because i see you and talk to you of course we do to god too but we we got to be really sincere and honest with one another we are certainly in a horrible horrible age and did you ever stop just let me give you just a little analysis not all that saith unto me lord lord will enter therein but one that doeth the will of my father jesus said on earth man shall not live by bread alone but by every word every word not just now and then a word but by every word it was one word misbelieved by god god's commandments that caused death sorrow every sickness and heartache to miss god's word one word if he taken the human race into death by missing misbelieving one word surely surely but he said it would happen satan said surely it won't but it did so we've got to keep every word of god and if the human and all his suffering and things that went on the human race by misconstruing or misbelieving one word how we going back by missing one if it cost all this price even the life of his son what's the point of restoring the word if we don't live the word the point of restoring the word was so that we would know what the word says that all that's been misconstrued and all that's been discombobulated through the thousands of years of man's reasonings god has brought it all back to the truth and brought it all back to life not to talk about but to live not to say god restored the truth but when god restored the truth he restored the truth for us to submit and surrender to that truth to live it to manifest it to subject ourselves to it he says here his word is always the truth always the truth his believing children believe for and cry for it until his word is vindicated and his word is always his will if you want to know what the will of god is find it in the bible it's god's word anything contrary to it is perverted and don't get into that hybrid condition that god said that's the truth we quoted jesus from john 14 15 last time he said if you love me keep my commandments pretty simple scripture jesus i love you he said if you love me keep my commandments oh god i love you so much if you love me keep my commandments and i i we we talked about last sunday we read where the apostle paul says if anybody spiritual among you let him acknowledge that the things i write unto you are the commandments of the lord so now we're not just talking about the four gospels now we're talking about the first church age messenger he gave the commandments of the lord too [Music] what about those things that brother ben and restored and taught out of the scriptures what are those the commandments of the lord [Music] if you love me keep my commandments i want to read just a couple examples from scripture just to highlight what i'm talking about let's look together in luke chapter 5. very simple example but i want to show the power of it luke chapter luke five five verse three and he entered into one of the ships which was simon's and prayed him that he should thrust out a little from the land he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draw and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing i love this nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net jesus was a carpenter's son peter was a fisherman by generations prophet tells us his father was a fisherman he was a generational fisherman who grew up all his life in the sea of galilee fishing for a living he was the expert fisherman he knew the sea he knew the times he knew the habits of the fish he knew the way to catch him he knew it all jesus as they knew him at that time was the son of a carpenter amen who may not even stayed long enough in the trade to learn at all but now he's there speaking and he has to use simon's ship and they thrust out a little bit he teaches and afterwards he said thrust out and let down thy net and simon says lord you know we've toiled all night and caught nothing i'm the expert you don't know the sea you don't know the fishing you don't know but at thy word at thy word i will let down the net and when they had this done they they enclosed a great multitude of fishes in their net break and they beckoned into their partners which were in the other ship these are other fishermen experts that were in the other ship and they should come and help them and they came and filled both ships so that they began to sink i think this is hilarious amen and i think it's written this way for a reason amen that it will draw attention this is extreme amen these were fishermen their boats were built to catch fish they every night and every day we're catching fish to bring the market they were experts the tackle was correct the boats were correct everything was set up for them to be commercial fishermen to make their living fishing and they had they had toiled all night and got nothing by their own skill their own ability their generational understanding by their experiences in life amen with their equipment and their tackle and their boats and everything that they had amen they caught nothing but at the word of jesus christ who was the word he said let down your nets for a draw he said lord we've caught nothing but at thy word we'll set down their nets and god does something in such an extreme way so that we get the picture amen the net which they had built was built for a commercial fisherman that net contained so many fish it began to break two boats two boats not one boat two boats that were set up as commercial fishing vessels took in so many fish they began to sink what is the point of the story the point of the story is forget everything you ever knew and follow his word amen forget what you knew forget your experiences forget all your understanding cast it all away and say lord at thy word i will do what you say do amen the whole world teaches amen in the united states that you need two incomes two working parents amen two working to make it but the brother branham said upon the word of god that a woman is to be a keeper at home you can just say i believe it in the name of jesus christ i'll take it as truth and watch the net break man there's no it's not wrong if a woman's willing brother brandon made exceptions for it even he even commended two women who were working and he says those women are working in a factory up here and god bless them they're holding their testimony there while they're helping their husbands so you're not we're not condemning you if you have to work but the whole world says you can't make it is that right the whole world says you can't make it your kids won't have enough stuff the stuff that's frying their brains and ruining their lives but the word of god then the prophet comes and backs it up and teaches us that a mother needs to be home with those little children and not according to my reasoning and not based off my intellect or what the world says but based off the word of god we'll believe what the prophet said and see what god will do amen i don't say that in any disrespect for a sister who finds yourself working god brother brandon made exceptions he he said there's reasons there's times if you find yourself in that then it's in the message but i'm talking about in general in general i remember i told you the story before but i remember when we had little children you know i we didn't have much so i packed my lunch every day everybody i worked with they bought lunch we were field technicians that were usually out and so i would pack my lunch i had my little igloo cooler and angie would pack it all in there and i'd go to work and and and all the guys they wanted to go out to these restaurants for lunch they want to go here and they wanted to go there and eat and and i would ask at the door can i bring my lunch in and eat my lunch with these guys and they would get so embarrassed to me actually the guys i worked with they got mad at me and one man said to me one time he says why don't you put that woman of yours to work amen i didn't even get mad at him praise god that was a victory in itself i don't remember what i said to him i don't remember how the conversation went but i remember i was shocked more than anything at what he said but i wasn't angry with him because i knew he didn't understand but i thank god for every bologna sandwich i ate because of what it did for my family and the character in my children and the life that they were able to live at home i don't regret a one amen i don't regret a time that i took my little igloo cooler into a restaurant and sat down and unpacked at nate where all these guys were ordering whatever meals they were ordering i don't regret it once amen because i've seen god honor that word and i can say in our family our net has broke and then this ship is nearly sunk by god blessing that decision i even had family members say you know you're so lucky your kids are so well behaved i was like do you know how many bologna sandwiches i've eaten so that mom's there teaching them every day i'm not lucky you know how many lunches i've missed down no it was it was respect and honor for the word of god i heard what a prophet said and i did it amen and god blessed it this is such an extreme story because i think god means for it to be i think he means to get our attention that we stop with all this reasoning and stop with trying to adapt the world's ways and stop with all this well you know well this is the way we've always done it and come back to what god has taught us and say if god taught it to us if the prophet taught it there's a reason behind it amen and i may not always understand it may not match my training my understanding my years of experience but if brother brennan was adamant on and he taught it and he and he brought it out of the scripture there's a reason behind it and i and i if we could say it this way not because i fully understand it not because i see the whole picture but at thy word i will do what the word says amen praise be to god brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said it's not an expression of some church that we should express something it's a life that you don't live yourself but he comes in you and lives by himself and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the spirit you say how how do i know i'm led by the spirit if you're following the word you're led by the spirit because the spirit is the life of the word it says the words i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life brother baby says in the message choosing of a bride so the other is pregnated by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes one body again like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word say god let it be that simple to me let it be that simple for me that i can just see it in your word and say i'll do it lord i'll do it i'll do it according to thy word i'll do it amen i want to read one more if i can before we close out of exodus chapter 7 let's turn to exodus chapter 7. exodus chapter 7 verse 8 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show a miracle for you then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it down before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent and moses and aaron went into pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also didn't like manner with their enchantments for they cast down every man as rod and they became serpents but aaron's rod swallowed up their rods brother makes a statement in the second seal he says and no doubt pharaoh said a cheap magician trick so he goes and gets his janus and jamboree says we can do those things too and they threw down their sticks and they became serpents now what could moses do what was it it was to show him that every genuine thing of god the devil's got an impersonator for him he impersonates to throw the people off the track what did moses do he said well i guess i made a mistake i better go back he just stood still for he had carried out his commission to the letter then the first thing you know moses servant eat up the other ones moses all he had was the commandment of god he wasn't told what would happen he didn't know how to handle every circumstance that he would face he was given a commandment and he knew what commandment was and so he took the rod in according to what god said and aaron took the rod and threw it down and it became a serpent that's as far as god had explained to him but after that something happened that moses probably didn't expect because moses now is standing upon the word of god he's doing what god said amen and we always expect that when we do what god says everything will work out perfect amen but we don't understand what's coming next amen so he just did what god said and something unexpected happened now the magicians did the same thing that they did and now they're rods amen become serpents amen brother said what could moses do he can't start explaining he can't backpedal he can't do anything he's standing on the word of god all he needs to do is stand still and let god keep his word amen [Music] amen not every time we take the word of god we get the results we expect amen sometimes if you've not been paying your tithe and giving offering the commandment the commandments of god says pay your tithe and give an offering and you'll return he'll return into your blessing amen and we expect amen the first time i dropped that tithe check in amen some great uncle that i didn't know about that died is going to die and i'm going to get an inheritance but you you could very well amen go into a tough time financially right afterwards it doesn't mean god's not going to bless you it doesn't mean god's not going to keep his word you don't know what's going to happen next but do you stop paying tithe no you stay with the word of god and let god do the part you can't do moses stood on the word of god and and he didn't know and moses didn't know what the solution was he didn't know what was going to happen next something unexpected happened but he stayed with the word and eventually that rod that serpent swallowed up the other serpents moses was probably as surprised as the egyptians how many times has god worked a situation out in your life that amazed people around you and you were just as amazed as those people were i mean we always play it cool like i knew god would take care of it everything was under control well there's times god does things and people are like how did that work out for you and you're like well you just trust god and things work out no you were saying i don't know how this is going to work out i did what he said to do and i don't know why this is happening and all of a sudden god works out a circumstance and everybody else says how did that happen how did you get that job how did that promotion come to you how did this work out in your life and you say i have no idea god did something i didn't expect it to go this way god at the last minute turned everything around and all of a sudden look at where we're at i'm just as amazed as you are god doesn't tell us everything he just gives us what we need and he'll take care of the rest you remember the story of elijah and mount cardinal the mount carmel showdown he has the showdown with all the prophets of bao and they they he does they build their altar he builds his altar he lays out the wood he douses it with water at the last minute and there's no way to delight this wood now it's been dumped water on it and he's got stones in place everything's in place the the the priest of baal went they've completely failed now comes time for the evening sacrifice it's the right time and elisha comes and says god i've done all this at thy word elisha had no power to bring fire down from heaven elisha could put stones together he could lay wood in order he could put the bullock on the wood he could even do what god told him to do the unreasonable part was to douse it with water he could even do that but he could not make the fire come down only god could do that but after elisha had done everything that god told him to do the reasonable parts and the unreasonable parts he stood and he says god i have done all this at thy word and then when he did the fire came down from heaven and consumed the sacrifice licked up the water consumed the stones that was extreme it needed to be extreme so that we would recognize the only way to victory is to keep all the word of god moses could have built an order or elijah could have built an altar he could have put the sticks in order he could have laid the sacrifice on it but he could have come to the water and say i just don't know about that water part why would god ask me to do something like that it doesn't make any sense that's too much that's not reasonable why would god require that but he did it anyways and he said god i've done all this at that word there's many times especially when i first come into the message there's many things that i didn't understand why why god wanted it this way why why is a woman's dress so important because i was taught all my life it's what's in the heart that matters not what's on the outside and there's truth to that and and and sometimes we would be discussing it my wife would ask me questions and a lot of times i don't know i don't understand i don't know but i know what the prophet taught i know what the scripture says so we just submitted guess what the fire fell in our lives when the fire fell in our lives for doing what for throwing away makeup for kicking out the tv why why do i have to kick out the tv like couldn't we just moderate and but the prophet said kick it out we kicked it out we but maybe a little this maybe a little that we were just dumb young foolish enough to just take him at his word by the grace of god it was god's grace in our lives but we just we just did it and we didn't always do it right and we didn't always do it the first time and we didn't always do it perfect amen but by the grace of god we'd go around the stump again and finally we would kick something out and finally we would throw this away and finally we would line up to that but i'm here to tell you that when we kept his word the fire fell in our lives and burn out the dross and and all of a sudden i began to understand the wisdom of everything he said amen why it had to be that way it was the only way it was the perfect way amen praise god brother baby says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says it depends on where you're born from if you're born of the word of god god's word has the preeminence in his church that's what he died for that's his purpose that he might be able to achieve to have his preeminence working in his church let the word of god shine forth first no matter what anything else looks like if you're born if you're born of the word of god god's word has preeminence in his church if you're born of the word of god the word of god will have preeminence and he goes on to say god needs prisoners today that will prison yourself to his will to his word god's looking for prisoners like paul we will prison yourself to his will and his will is what his word he says and god's only provide a place of worship and i'll just wrap up with this and two scriptures that every little jaw everything you must be faithful and always the little vine the little fox that spoils the vine sometimes you leave it's not the big things that you do it's the little things you leave undone remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link blessed are they that do all the commandments of god that they might have right to enter in do all god said and it said for women to have long hair you say a man told me not long ago i don't preach a close line religion i said then you're not preaching the gospel god laid it out there he said what to do and you either do it that's your natural reasonable thing that little thing that little insignificant jesus said blessed are they that would take all the little things do do the little things and a woman to let her hair grow that's just why it's just something she can do and she won't even do that she won't even do that oh teach us great things how can i teach you the great things when you won't do the simple common thing because you see this is the part that i really want you to catch because you see your motive and your objective is wrong what's the big deal about this and this he's getting to the big deal the big deal is your motive and objective is wrong you still want you still desire you still lust for you still want you still need you still like it's not you say well what's what's with this little thing and what's with that brother brother said if you do that you know how can you teach great things when you won't do the simple common things because you see your motive and your objective is wrong now listen what he says next it's your love to god lord i don't care what you want me to do i'm willing to do it then you're getting somewhere but if you don't do it that way the way he said do it see it's we want to learn brother he's told over and over why don't you teach these women great things how to prophesy and how to have spiritual gifts said how can i teach them that when they don't do the abcs i say that's still true today if it was true in his day it's true i mean we we can all we want look back at the nominations and say they do this and do that and do that but you know what the message wasn't given to the denominations the message was given to us i say let the scourging of the message purify my heart and purge my life amen sometimes we we can take such pride in understanding what the opening of the seals was and what the seventh seal is the coming of the lord amen but you can say i know what the seventh seal is but but you won't dress the way a prophet said to dress and the question is why i mean why are we so comfortable knowing all the great mysteries of god but we can't be comfortable doing a simple obedience that brother branham said is our reasonable service something you can do you can take the high heels off you're the one who buys them to put them back on [Music] remember in the message years ago they threw away all the high heels so they weren't in the house somebody bought them again [Applause] why they were already out how did they come back in how did sexy dress come back in how did these things they were already kicked out how did they come back in amen the little foxes spoil the vine we get comfortable that we've heard the message we received malachi 4. we got all this and that and what we're touting malachi 4 little things are slipping back in our reasonable service is going away i praise god i received the prophet's message i believe in malachi 4. i understand what the seventh seal is i see this and i see this and this type in this shadow amen but the little things keep creeping back in i think sometimes we get too comfortable that we know so much but let's not forget our first love when we came to the message and was willing to throw everything away when he first came to the message we was willing to let it all go let's not forget that let's not lose that love that says i'm going to i i want to receive all the message all the truth the deep things of god and keep the little things at the same time i want to obey samuel the prophet says to saul after saul disobeys his commandment it says in samuel said hath the lord as great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams samuel had disobeyed a prophet's commandment and what was his excuse his excuse for disobeying was i wanted to offer these to god i wanted to do god a great service and i wanted to keep the best animals amen from and god had told them to slay everything every beast every animal every man woman child slay it all but he saved some back and when the prophet said why did you disobey he said because i wanted to do a service for god i wanted to sacrifice these great offerings to god and he said is god more pleased in your works and your sacrifice and your big show or is he pleased in obedience what pleases god is it the great big show and the great big effort and the great big sacrifice or is it in obedience and we know that god replaced saul with david is that right and i want to read a scripture to you out of acts 13 it's the last scripture i want to read acts 13 verse 21 i'll read verse 22 as well and afterward they desired a king and god gave them unto them saul the son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will what was it about david that god wanted it wasn't his strength because david was small it wasn't his experience in battle because he had none it wasn't his stature it wasn't his wisdom god chose david and he contrasted david with saul for one reason saul would use his own thinking to try to serve god to go a little bit beyond what the prophet said and disobey the prophet but he disobeyed the prophet for a good reason he had a good reason for disobeying the prophet because the boy i know the prophet said that but [Applause] i'm doing something good but he said i chose david who's a man after my own heart and in sam in the book of samuel it just stops there he said i've chose david a man after my own heart but in the book of acts he adds another statement he said a man after in my heart that will do all my will i'd like to say something to you the church ages who were rejected were no better than them some of them were wise intellectual hard-working sacrificing they were children of god elect do you believe that but they were rejected because they put away the word we're not better because of strength we're not better because of intelligence we're not better because of gifts god is looking for a bride in this day that's after his own heart and when god was here in flesh the flesh of jesus christ what was his what was his character like what was his main attribute what was it made him the most successful amen is because he would not do anything of himself he would only do what the father showed him he would he made a complete full surrender and a hundred percent obedience to the will of god and he never took his own way he only took the father's way amen and now he's looking for a wife after his own heart who will be christ in female form he proved his messiahship when he said not my will but thine be done how will we prove our messiahship he proved in the garden of gethsemane who he was how will we prove who we are by doing the same thing by saying god not my will but thy will be done if this is what you taught this is what i want if this is how you had it preached through the seventh angel then that's the way i want to believe it and that's the way i want to live it help me god not my will but thy will oh god david wasn't stronger than saul he wasn't taller than saul he wasn't more experienced than saul but saul was rejected because he took his own thinking david was chosen because he would do all the will of god we're not smarter better looking stronger more capable i want to be one that'll do all his will [Music] god's predestinated us to be that kind of people let's yield to it and strive to be that kind of people let's give all of our heart to this word it's not my works lord i've cast out devils i've done this i've done great listen it's easy to deceive ourselves we can see i mean when you start feeling down you start feeling low and all of a sudden god does something for you i'm a son of god listen i was a son of god before he did something for me i was a son of god before the manifestation i was the son of god before the work i was a son of god i've always been a son of god [Music] i don't want to be deceived by those things i don't want to deceive myself i want to be a son of god who obeys all his will amen i want to say not my will but thy will be done if you saw fit to vindicate this prophet and this prophet taught the word this way god help me to line to that and forgive me lord for my own reasonings give me wisdom almighty god amen let's all stand amen i pray i've been able to share my heart with you and that you can catch the heart's desire amen my heart's desire amen listen this is so far removed from any legalistic idea i hope you get that notion far out of your mind it has nothing to do with that amen legalism is thinking you can attain to something by doing something that's legalism i can attain to this position by doing right you'll never attain to nothing unless god's ordained you to be in that position all the right works will never give you anything this isn't legalism this is obedience obedience is not legalism but the perfect son of god obeyed the father the daughter of god will obey the father today christ was submissive his bride will be submissive christ kept all the word the bride will keep all the words don't get caught up in where this and where this and where that let's take time and say am i who am i what am i what rock am i standing on is there iniquity anywhere in my life if there is god expose it and get it out of my life because it's not going to work let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus god i thank you for your word god this is an age like no other age this is a day like no other day and you have called us you've elected us and chosen us before the foundation of the world to live in this day but god you've stripped away ignorance now there's no excuse for ignorance you've given us example by example even so much that there was a son of man on earth in this day that would reflect perfectly the son of man that would show us what a mature son of god in the end time will look like you've given us tapes and books we have video recordings audio recordings we have testimonies by the droves god you've been good to us let us not forsake that lord let us not bring a reproach against the effort you put forth to give us a pure word but god help us to surrender for you've called us to that kind of surrender [Music] god i believe this is the day for a full manifestation of the messiahs to reflect the very life and nature of the bridegroom and the bride but god we can't do it of ourselves we need your spirit lord god all we can do is the reasonable things the things you've commanded the things you've told we can lay down what you've told us to lay down we can put away what you've told us to put away but at the end of the day our strength is not sufficient to go all the way we need you to empower us lord by your spirit help us to keep this word every jot and every tittle help us to stay lined up and true and obedient to the word lord help us to surrender a fresh surrender every day to your word help us god not to be deceived lord by the blessedness the blessed things you do for us but help us lord to judge ourselves against your word and if we found lacking lord give us the grace to cry out and say god forgive me and help me and help me in this area lord so that i can be all that you called me to be in this area in this age lord bless your children bless your people i pray that you do heart surgery now that you calmed the hearts our hearts lord may we be laid bare before you lord may you go through our hearts and show us lord those areas we need to line to your word and then may you give us the grace to line to your word for god it's not going to be anything that we've done but it's going to be what you've done through us and in us we yield to you we surrender lord now come and give us the power to live the life god we love you we thank you lord help us to win our victories and our gethsemanes to lay down our will for your will point by point line by line scripture by scripture let us have our gethsemanes and help us to surrender to your will above all i love you father i thank you for your children that are gathered here pray you bless them and keep them and prosper them in the way help me lord help us to live what we talk about not to talk about it but to live it lord lord you don't want lip service you want a life fully surrendered god we give you our lives afresh tonight take them let us not be a sermon let it be a call to action oh we love you we ask that you would move in us and through us for your purpose and for your glory for we will give you all the glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you brother ben have this [Music] [Music] [Music] and i [Music]
