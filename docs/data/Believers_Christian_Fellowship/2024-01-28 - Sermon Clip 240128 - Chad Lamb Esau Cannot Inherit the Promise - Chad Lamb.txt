========================================

I was looking at this subject of the millennial Reign and this is when Christ returns to set up his kingdom physically upon the Earth and we rule and reign with him we're part of that Kingdom we're part of the ruling Authority amen we're part of the Kingdom that gives rulership and there's even discussion in the scriptures where where there's even uh uh we we even take part in the government so that if even Egypt doesn't come up to the Feast of Tabernacles there'll be no reain for them there'll be retri tion there'll be correction there'll be teaching there'll be instruction there'll be all of this going on in the Millennium and we'll be part of it am he told them that you know I'll give I'll make you ruler over cities and when are these these promises going to take place and when are these rewards going to come in the millennial Reign but where my meditation was is how in the world am I going to sit on a throne with Jesus Christ and Rule and Reign for a thousand years when I can't rule this little plot of Earth he's given me today what makes me think that I'm going to rule in the Millennium with Christ when he's asked me to possess one little clump of dirt one little corner one postage stamp size of Earth and he's given not a city not a village not a town not even a household he has given me one little clump of his dirt creation and he's asking me to rule that and I can't even bring this clump of dirt to subjection to the word what makes makes me think I'm going to rule and reign in the Millennium if we're not able amen by the grace of God and by the spirit of God to bring this dirt into subjection to the word by the by the authority of the word and the power of the spirit what makes us think we're fit to rule and Reign for a thousand years I say God help me to get it right now amen help me to take that word and bring how am I going to bring Egypt subjection to the word and say Egypt if you don't come to Feast the Tabernacles you get no rain when I'm not coming subject to all of the word what hypocrisy say God help me you've got to help me God I I I'm tired of looking everywhere else for what's wrong I'm finding plenty of wrong right here I've got enough wrong right here to preoccupy the rest of my days on Earth I'm pretty sure of that but now I realize what my goal is because what does he want in the great plan of God he had a three-fold purpose and the second is to get preeminence in a man what does he want he wants full control right here he wants somebody to give him first place and I want to be I want to be the patch of earth that is dedicated and designated to Jesus Christ the word alone and there's one spot on Earth where God is glorified one spot where his name is well spoken of one spot where he's glorified one spot where he rules and Reigns if it's not anywhere else in the earth I want it to be in this earth right here
