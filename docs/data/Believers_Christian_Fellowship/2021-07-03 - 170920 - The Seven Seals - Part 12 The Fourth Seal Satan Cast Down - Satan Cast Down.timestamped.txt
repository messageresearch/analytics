[0:00] let's look together revelations chapter
[0:02] 6
[0:04] verse 7. when he had opened the fourth
[0:07] seal i heard the voice of the fourth be
[0:09] say come and see
[0:10] and i looked and behold a pale horse and
[0:12] his name that sat on him was death
[0:14] and hell followed with him and power was
[0:17] given unto them over the
[0:18] over the fourth part of the earth to
[0:20] kill with the sword and with hunger
[0:22] and with the death and with the beast of
[0:24] the earth
[0:26] amen let's just pray dear heavenly
[0:28] father we ask that you had just anoint
[0:30] us now lord as we look into your word
[0:33] we pray lord that your holy spirit would
[0:34] take control and that you would speak
[0:36] your words of eternal life lord help us
[0:39] all to relax
[0:40] lord and to receive from you what you
[0:42] have for us we pray that you would bind
[0:44] every spirit in here that be contrary to
[0:46] your spirit
[0:47] and let your holy ghost have preeminence
[0:48] and free reign in our hearts and in our
[0:51] lives
[0:51] we ask that you bless us lord and keep
[0:53] drawing us up higher
[0:54] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[0:58] god bless you as your seed and
[1:01] i just wanted to mention i appreciate
[1:04] that song
[1:06] brother telus wrote and we sang it as a
[1:08] congregation
[1:09] i really enjoyed that i thought that was
[1:11] a wonderful blessing and i
[1:12] appreciate joe for helping us get it as
[1:15] a congregational song
[1:16] it's so nice to see god using gifts in
[1:19] the body
[1:20] to bless the body i mean what what what
[1:23] inspiration went into the song and to
[1:25] sing it once or twice and let it be
[1:27] passed off the scene would be a shame we
[1:29] want to make that part of our worship
[1:31] amen
[1:32] and so i just appreciate that and
[1:35] brother tell us and i were talking the
[1:36] other day and
[1:37] he said something to me that he piqued
[1:39] my interest he said something and
[1:40] pointed to something
[1:42] that i hadn't paid close attention to in
[1:43] the fourth seal so i want to bring that
[1:45] to you i think it's
[1:46] it's interesting in verse 7 he said and
[1:49] when he had opened the fourth
[1:50] seal i heard the voice of the fourth
[1:52] beast say come and see
[1:54] now this is unique to the seals because
[1:56] when you look at the first seal
[1:58] the second seal on the third seal you
[2:00] heard the beast
[2:01] say first you heard the beast say the
[2:03] second one you heard the beast say
[2:05] the second beast the third one you hear
[2:07] the third beast but this is the first
[2:08] time where it says they heard the voice
[2:10] of the fourth beast
[2:12] because god is honing in on something
[2:14] every word matters brothers and sisters
[2:16] because it ties us right to revelations
[2:18] 10 7 because this ties us
[2:21] to revelations 10 7 in the days of the
[2:23] voice of the seventh angel
[2:25] and when we hear the voice of the fourth
[2:28] beast of the eagle anointing
[2:30] i mean i think god wants us to see the
[2:32] word voice
[2:34] so we can correlate and put these two
[2:36] things together and recognize we're
[2:37] talking about the same thing
[2:39] hallelujah what a blessing that was so i
[2:41] appreciated that insight
[2:43] and drawing my attention to that it was
[2:45] wonderful
[2:46] you know the world's falling apart but
[2:50] the bride's coming together
[2:52] amen and you know just watching the news
[2:55] over the last week has been absolutely
[2:56] astonishing
[2:58] i can hardly believe you know what we're
[3:00] seeing we know these things are true and
[3:02] and it's it's not just astonishing it's
[3:04] grieving because these are people's
[3:05] lives these are
[3:07] these are terrible things that are
[3:08] happening but we know when we see
[3:10] people losing property and people losing
[3:12] lives and destruction coming upon the
[3:15] earth
[3:15] we realize the high price of sin
[3:18] you can see you can see why
[3:22] god cannot withhold judgment god gave
[3:25] space to repent
[3:26] he even gave cain an opportunity to
[3:28] repent and cain refused to repent
[3:30] and god sent him out from the presence
[3:32] of the lord and him and his whole
[3:34] lineage went into utter destruction in
[3:36] the flood
[3:37] god couldn't stop he he's a just god he
[3:39] gives space to repent
[3:41] but if you refuse amen your opportunity
[3:43] to repent there's nothing left but
[3:45] judgment
[3:46] when mercy is spurned there's nothing
[3:48] less but judgment and this world has
[3:50] spurned all the mercy that god could
[3:52] extend
[3:53] and the long-suffering of the lord he
[3:55] sent he sent prophets and he sent
[3:57] preachers and he sent church-age
[3:58] messengers
[3:59] and the world has continued to march to
[4:01] the beat of lucifer and not to the word
[4:03] and god cannot be a just god and
[4:05] withhold judgments
[4:08] and just over just a little over a week
[4:10] we saw two major
[4:11] earthquakes hit mexico yesterday another
[4:14] one hit mexico city
[4:17] the same day amen one hit
[4:20] off the east coast of japan a 6.1 two
[4:23] nights before that a small one hit los
[4:25] angeles 3.6
[4:27] the whole earth is shaking friends it's
[4:30] shaking and there's a reason that it's
[4:32] shaking
[4:33] because because we know that that this
[4:36] world is bringing forth birth pains
[4:37] brother branham started preaching
[4:39] birth pains and in birth pains he starts
[4:41] to explain to us
[4:42] that the earth is bringing forth the the
[4:45] earth from the womb of the earth it's
[4:47] birthing forth
[4:48] a new world for a millennium a bright
[4:50] new world for a millennium
[4:52] for the honeymoon period of christ and
[4:54] his bride and so as
[4:56] it gets closer and closer and closer to
[4:58] bringing forth that new millennial world
[5:01] the the birth pains increase in
[5:03] intensity and get closer together
[5:05] and brother brennan begins to explain
[5:07] this birth pains to us
[5:08] and so we realize that the birth pains
[5:11] are coming to produce
[5:13] a new world amen a bright new earth for
[5:16] a millennium
[5:17] refashioned and and and remade for the
[5:20] millennial reign
[5:21] so we realize that these birth pains
[5:23] have to be timed just right
[5:25] because they have to correlate with the
[5:28] condition of the bride
[5:30] because you can't birth the world too
[5:33] early because we have to have the
[5:34] rapture first
[5:35] and the birth pains are increasing
[5:37] intensity until it comes to the final
[5:39] push in the three and a half year
[5:41] tribulation period
[5:42] and that final push will absolutely
[5:44] disrupt all of nature amen
[5:47] atomic bombs will go off volcanoes will
[5:49] go off everything will disrupt until the
[5:51] earth is formed over again
[5:54] but that final push can't start until
[5:56] the rapture
[5:57] so as we see this getting more intense
[5:59] and more intense and more intense
[6:01] we've had hurricane harvey amen and you
[6:04] know we've had hurricanes since harvey
[6:06] who talks about harvey anymore that was
[6:09] just three or four weeks ago and there's
[6:11] people still underwater in houston
[6:14] but that's old news now used to be you
[6:16] have a disaster like that and it's news
[6:18] for a year
[6:19] now it's news for a week if not that
[6:22] it's news for a couple days because then
[6:23] there's a bigger one coming
[6:25] a greater one coming something that's
[6:27] unprecedented something that's never
[6:28] happened before and something we haven't
[6:30] had in the century
[6:32] what is it it's the birth pains and the
[6:35] birth pains are timed amen
[6:37] just right because it's got to go to the
[6:39] final push in the tribulation period but
[6:42] right before that the church has the
[6:43] rapture
[6:44] so the ripeness of the bride is bringing
[6:46] birth pains
[6:50] you're it's you it's your condition that
[6:53] is causing the news reports
[6:55] it is you getting in line with the word
[6:57] as you coming into the maturity of the
[6:59] seed
[6:59] it's you coming to harvest ripeness that
[7:02] is bringing the birth pains on the earth
[7:05] when you read your newspaper it's you
[7:08] coming into position that is causing
[7:10] this earth
[7:10] to speed up amen the birth pains are
[7:13] coming rapid because
[7:14] the earth has to be ready to push forth
[7:16] a new world for a millennium when the
[7:18] bride gets raptured
[7:20] so everything is moving in condition and
[7:22] timing according to the condition of the
[7:25] bride
[7:27] hallelujah we're watching chaos
[7:31] break out around the planet not just
[7:34] hurricanes not just earthquakes fires
[7:37] droughts political unrest economic
[7:41] disturbance
[7:42] the whole world is crumbling
[7:47] everything is absolutely falling apart
[7:49] there's not a political hope in the
[7:51] world
[7:51] there's not an economic hope in the
[7:53] world the whole thing is a disaster
[7:56] why because it's all about to fall apart
[7:59] and bring forth a new world for a
[8:00] millennium
[8:02] why because the bride is coming into her
[8:04] position
[8:05] she's coming in to harvest maturity and
[8:07] ripeness
[8:09] i don't know about you but i'm excited
[8:12] we don't enjoy the judgments of god we
[8:14] don't take pleasure in what's happening
[8:16] but we do recognize our position and we
[8:19] do recognize what's going on
[8:22] praise god let's pull up oh we got it
[8:24] pulled up already
[8:26] we want to go into the fourth seal and
[8:28] take a look at these things as we go
[8:30] and and what we're seeing in the world
[8:31] is very pertinent to the fourth seal
[8:34] brother branham said here
[8:37] said so happy to be back in the house of
[8:39] the lord tonight this is his opening
[8:40] comments in the fourth seal
[8:42] in the service again and so happy that
[8:44] just thought this one wouldn't come
[8:46] but it finally did and i'm so thankful
[8:48] that being the last of those four horse
[8:50] riders
[8:50] which i think is the one of the main
[8:53] messages to
[8:54] the church at this time and that's the
[8:56] absolute truth
[8:57] the rapture is contained in the fourth
[8:59] seal the full maturity of the brides
[9:01] contained in the full
[9:02] for for seal the unleashing of the sixth
[9:04] seal judgment
[9:05] is in the fourth seal amen it's all here
[9:08] and that's where we live
[9:09] right now that's why this is one the
[9:12] main message
[9:13] to the church at this time so we know
[9:16] that
[9:17] this fourth horse rider is the pale
[9:19] horse is spiritual death
[9:22] and the incarnate devil there's a
[9:25] principle i want to look at brother
[9:26] brandon brings out in the third seal
[9:27] he said now let's back let's just
[9:29] background this just a little bit on the
[9:31] seals that we have passed
[9:32] because just like in the church ages why
[9:35] we try to give a background to kind of
[9:37] lap it over
[9:38] until you could that's the way the ages
[9:40] are actually in the scripture
[9:42] one laps the other one over just like
[9:44] that climbing a ladder or climbing a
[9:46] step
[9:46] rather one one running down to the other
[9:49] and coming
[9:50] back like that as you go up steps now
[9:52] see brother brandon's teaching a
[9:53] principle and if you don't catch this
[9:55] principle we're going to be totally lost
[9:57] because he says in the church ages the
[9:58] church ages lap over one another
[10:01] one age blends into the other age amen
[10:04] and he said the same thing for the seals
[10:06] he wants the background because the
[10:07] seals
[10:07] just like the church ages one laps over
[10:10] the other
[10:10] and brother branham said it's like going
[10:12] up a set of steps a ladder of steps
[10:15] if you go up this and i can say we've
[10:17] got four seals here right
[10:19] one two three four don't count the first
[10:20] one i'm here
[10:23] i can count when i go to this one i'm on
[10:26] the first seal
[10:27] but when i go here i'm transitioning
[10:29] from first to second
[10:30] there's a period of time that i'm in
[10:32] both seals just like the church ages and
[10:34] then i move up
[10:35] i'm no longer in the first seal i'm
[10:37] totally in the second and then there's
[10:39] another transition period where we're
[10:41] moving up through
[10:42] and we're transitioning to the other and
[10:44] then we're transitioning to the fourth
[10:46] if you if you try to make it a meat
[10:47] cleaver where you hop from one to the
[10:49] other
[10:50] you're gonna miss what god's doing
[10:51] because there's certain thing he says
[10:53] that applies here
[10:54] there's certain things that he says
[10:55] applies here and certain things that
[10:56] apply here
[10:59] so you have to understand where you are
[11:01] and brother branham is a transitional
[11:03] prophet just like elijah
[11:05] when he came and john the baptist was a
[11:06] transitional prophet
[11:08] taking them from the law to grace moving
[11:11] them amen from
[11:12] the atonement of bulls and ghosts to the
[11:14] atonement of the lamb of god
[11:15] and he stood in the gap joining the two
[11:18] together and brother branham came to do
[11:20] the same thing he come
[11:21] he comes as a transitional prophet to
[11:23] stand in the gap
[11:24] and move us amen from the atonement
[11:27] under the church ages
[11:28] to the true atonement the restoration of
[11:30] the word
[11:32] amen and so you've got to catch the
[11:35] transitions
[11:36] and the reason why is is brother branham
[11:38] says in the in the fourth seal
[11:42] he says watch he rides on a pale horse
[11:44] as he appears on his ride
[11:46] the last ride he's on that last now and
[11:48] that's not in our day
[11:50] that will be on down it's the seal
[11:52] foretold because see
[11:53] the church has dawn gone up when this
[11:55] happens when christ appears here on
[11:58] earth
[11:58] this fellow appears and becomes
[12:00] completely the devil
[12:02] so brother brahms talking about
[12:04] something that's coming under the fourth
[12:06] seal
[12:06] and when the fourth seal when we make
[12:08] the full transition from third to fourth
[12:10] seal
[12:11] amen then the the bride is raptured and
[12:14] when she's raptured
[12:15] the devil comes down and fully
[12:17] incarnates the beast
[12:18] at that time fully incarnates the boat
[12:20] becoming the beast of the beast at that
[12:22] time
[12:23] amen and that's coming in the future
[12:25] that hasn't happened yet
[12:26] because it can't happen until the
[12:28] rapture of the church and he comes down
[12:29] and fully incarnates one man
[12:32] but we have already come to the
[12:34] transition period because if we hadn't
[12:36] come to the transition period the eagle
[12:38] couldn't be flying
[12:40] but brother brahma said we're in the
[12:41] eagle age the eagle is flying
[12:44] because we're moving into the fourth
[12:45] seal
[12:47] i think as we go along you're going to
[12:48] see this more clearly
[12:54] he says the fourth stage of the writer
[12:56] watch the fourth stage of this writer is
[12:58] called death
[12:59] death means eternal separation from god
[13:02] that's what death means to be eternal
[13:04] separated from god why is that because
[13:07] when we move
[13:08] completely to the fourth seal and the
[13:10] church is gone
[13:12] there is no more mercy there is no more
[13:14] blood there is no more place
[13:16] except for the hundred and forty four
[13:17] thousand for redemption because when the
[13:19] bride goes up the blood goes up because
[13:21] the bride is the spirit by the blood
[13:24] the bride is the blood by the spirit so
[13:26] we know that that the bride is here and
[13:28] she's the mercy seat on earth holding
[13:30] mercy open
[13:31] but when she goes up amen what's
[13:35] left for those who are not already
[13:37] sealed away
[13:38] there's no transition he that is filthy
[13:40] be filthy still
[13:41] he that is righteous is righteous still
[13:43] even the foolish virgin can't change
[13:45] state once the rapture goes there is
[13:48] nobody that can enter in once the
[13:50] rapture goes
[13:51] so now what you move to is eternal
[13:53] separation
[13:54] from god all except the 144 thousand
[13:58] they're under a special covenant
[14:01] he says under the four seal no wonder he
[14:03] could impersonate himself in the
[14:04] personified name
[14:06] and called death he sure was now god
[14:08] only knows how many he calls to
[14:10] spiritually die
[14:12] by his anti-bible word teaching this is
[14:14] the one he put 68
[14:16] million to the sword and killed and
[14:18] probably
[14:19] literally billions died spiritually on
[14:21] his false teaching
[14:23] no wonder he could take the name death
[14:25] so brother madam now is taking this
[14:27] forth
[14:28] uh this this horse rider coming to the
[14:30] fourth stage now receives a name
[14:32] he's been death all along
[14:35] when he rode the first horse he was
[14:37] death when he rode the second horse he
[14:39] was death
[14:39] when he so when he comes as compromise
[14:42] on a white horse he's death
[14:45] slight deviation from the word is death
[14:48] it's death riding that power but he's
[14:51] changing horses because he's trying to
[14:53] bring
[14:54] the people to eternal separation from
[14:57] god
[14:58] to spiritual death and so death moves
[15:00] from the white horse
[15:02] to the red horse death moves from the
[15:03] red horse to the black horse
[15:05] death moves onto the pale horse when he
[15:07] moves on to the pear horse
[15:08] now he can be named because why because
[15:11] now there's a prophet on the scene under
[15:13] the eagle anointing we have the voice of
[15:15] the fourth beast
[15:16] who's the voice of the seventh church
[15:18] age messenger
[15:20] who can now declare who's been on the
[15:22] horse all the time
[15:24] amen luther couldn't tell you who was on
[15:26] the horse amen wesley couldn't tell you
[15:28] who was on that horse but at the opening
[15:30] of the seals there's a prophet under the
[15:32] eagle anointing
[15:33] that can say that man's name is death
[15:35] that's the antichrist that's been
[15:37] writing that all the way through
[15:38] and now he's openly declared
[15:42] amen he's bringing the people to the
[15:44] physical battle of armageddon where
[15:46] there's utter complete
[15:47] destruction for those who gather
[15:49] together
[15:51] but listen to what brother branham said
[15:53] just one line statement back in the
[15:55] third seal he says now
[15:56] there's always the natural and the
[15:59] spiritual
[16:02] keep that in your mind brother branham
[16:04] said all prophecy has a natural and a
[16:06] spiritual fulfillment
[16:08] hallelujah there's always
[16:11] natural and spiritual we find this very
[16:14] clearly in the scriptures when there's a
[16:15] prophecy that said i call my son jacob
[16:17] out of egypt
[16:18] amen and what he's talking about is the
[16:20] exodus when he brings
[16:22] the nation of israel out of egypt but it
[16:24] also
[16:25] applies to jesus when when by a
[16:28] visitation of an
[16:29] angel in a dream joseph is told to take
[16:31] his family down into egypt to avoid the
[16:33] wrath of herod
[16:34] and he goes into egypt and then another
[16:37] angel tells him that herod is dead come
[16:38] out of egypt
[16:39] so that that verse applies to the nation
[16:42] of
[16:43] israel and it also applies to jesus
[16:46] christ
[16:48] the same scripture we have scriptures in
[16:50] the psalms that apply to david
[16:52] but they also apply to jesus christ and
[16:54] they also apply to the bride of jesus
[16:56] christ
[16:57] yes and because the word is eternal it
[16:59] just keeps rolling and rolling and
[17:01] rolling
[17:02] amen once you see the pattern that fits
[17:04] it will always work
[17:06] it never changes amen praise
[17:09] god so so we have to understand now that
[17:13] yes he brings them to physical death
[17:15] but before he brings them to physical
[17:17] death he brings them to spiritual death
[17:30] hallelujah
[17:34] the four series said like he gave egypt
[17:36] to give egypt place to repent
[17:38] what was the last peg plague was death
[17:40] that's the last plague that's hit the
[17:42] pentecostal church
[17:43] now remember spiritual and natural we
[17:46] know that there's going to be an
[17:47] incarnation when the devil is cast out
[17:49] of heaven
[17:50] amen when the bride goes up he enters
[17:52] into the
[17:53] to the the beast and he brings everybody
[17:56] to death
[17:56] right he brings to the battle of
[17:58] armageddon and brings him to physical
[17:59] death but before that happens he
[18:01] already brings the church to spiritual
[18:03] death and here's what brother brenham
[18:05] said
[18:05] it was death the last plague was death
[18:07] that's the last plague that hit
[18:09] the pentecostal church it's spiritual
[18:12] death
[18:12] she's dead not will be dead
[18:16] she's dead that's in the name of the
[18:18] lord she's spiritually
[18:20] dead he gave her a place to repent and
[18:23] she rejected it
[18:25] now she's dead shall never
[18:28] rise again and what brother bennum is
[18:31] showing is that the fourth horse
[18:32] amen the death is already entered in the
[18:35] ecclesiastical realm
[18:36] it's already entered into the spiritual
[18:39] realm before it comes to the physical
[18:41] realm
[18:41] he's already incarnate in a church
[18:45] before he ever becomes incarnate and one
[18:47] man he's incarnate in a church
[18:49] this is so important to know because we
[18:51] realize that the devil is only mimicking
[18:54] what god does
[18:55] and we know jesus christ is going to
[18:57] return amen in revelations 19
[18:59] riding on a white horse to come and
[19:01] bring destruction to all those that
[19:03] gather against jerusalem
[19:04] how many knows that's true and when he
[19:06] returns amen
[19:08] he is he was incarnate god incarnate and
[19:10] one vessel jesus christ
[19:12] battling with devil incarnate and one
[19:15] vessel amen
[19:16] the beast but before we get to that
[19:21] battle of armageddon
[19:22] amen we've got to back up before the
[19:24] rapture of the church
[19:25] and now the devil has gathered his false
[19:28] bride
[19:29] and he's incarnate and infiltrated and
[19:32] incarnate the church
[19:33] because jesus christ is incarnate his
[19:36] bride
[19:37] in his church and now the battle is
[19:39] going on
[19:40] right now friends we're right in the
[19:44] middle of the battle of these two great
[19:46] forces on earth
[19:47] and don't you think that that that that
[19:50] we've got a lot of friends out there in
[19:51] the denominational system we have no
[19:53] friends out there in the denominational
[19:55] system not anything against the people
[19:57] the people might be just fine
[19:59] but the system itself is going to come
[20:01] after you
[20:03] that's a promise hallelujah and those
[20:06] who are married to the system
[20:08] will turn on you also
[20:11] because he's incarnate he's incarnate
[20:14] the people
[20:15] first and then he's incarnate the one
[20:17] vessel
[20:18] jesus in christ comes incarnate and the
[20:20] people first called the bride
[20:22] and then he comes back incarnate in one
[20:24] vessel
[20:27] spiritual and natural you've got to
[20:29] watch the spiritual and natural
[20:31] hallelujah so the pentecostal church
[20:34] and the pentecostal church is the final
[20:37] stage
[20:38] of the harlot system you have to realize
[20:41] that that the catholic system came up to
[20:43] thyatira and we'll get into this maybe
[20:45] more on sunday
[20:46] the catholic system came up through
[20:47] three stages then in the fourth stage
[20:50] it's come to the pinnacle of its power
[20:52] and it gave it was given space to repent
[20:54] it did not repent and went into
[20:55] spiritual death
[20:56] and then the protestant system rose out
[20:58] of that and for the final three church
[21:00] ages the protestant system's been going
[21:03] and the final stage is pentecost and
[21:05] here comes a prophet on the scene
[21:07] that says pentecost has is dead
[21:10] it's come to death because as as the as
[21:13] the protestant harlot system was moving
[21:15] into death
[21:16] there was a system of the bride that was
[21:18] moving into life
[21:21] because the battle has always been
[21:22] between life and death christ and
[21:24] antichrist
[21:26] hallelujah only two forces
[21:31] and the four seal on mine he knows you
[21:34] yet he gave her space to repent but
[21:36] she didn't do it he's done it again she
[21:39] won't do it hurry
[21:40] so he gave her space to repent she
[21:42] didn't do it he's talking about
[21:44] the catholic church you have the
[21:47] and the harlots the mother and the
[21:48] daughters
[21:49] he's he's done it again because he did
[21:52] it to the pentecostals
[21:53] he's done it again she won't do it her
[21:56] rejection away
[21:57] makes her her rejection makes her a
[21:59] perfect way for satan to come
[22:01] into her and incarnate
[22:04] incarnate what incarnate the false
[22:06] church
[22:08] and let's read that her rejection whose
[22:12] rejection
[22:12] the false church her rejection makes a
[22:15] perfect way for satan to come into her
[22:18] and be incarnate incarnate himself right
[22:21] in her because she rejected the word
[22:24] and that's exactly the same thing that
[22:25] the protestant church becomes a harlot
[22:27] is because she rejected
[22:28] the vindicated truth of the word of god
[22:31] and that gives
[22:32] the devil a place to come right in and
[22:34] incarnate
[22:35] himself and he will make an image unto
[22:38] the beast when they can consolidate
[22:39] together
[22:40] right yonder now and go on and do just
[22:42] exactly what he said
[22:45] so now the devil that now i told you
[22:48] before the secret of the four seals
[22:50] incarnation
[22:52] that's the secret of the fourth seal an
[22:54] incarnate devil and an incarnate god and
[22:57] you just have to know
[22:58] where are they incarnate at one is
[23:01] incarnating himself
[23:02] in the false church that was given space
[23:04] to repent and she did not repent
[23:06] and her rejection of the word makes up
[23:08] the perfect scenario
[23:09] for the devil himself to enter into her
[23:13] right why because he's only copying what
[23:17] god is doing
[23:20] the third seal said the first first
[23:23] three stages of them went into the dark
[23:24] age talking about church ages
[23:26] went to the dark age then the third
[23:28] three stages
[23:29] amen comes the church out from
[23:32] justification
[23:33] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[23:35] again incarnate god made manifest
[23:38] among us here he comes in as the
[23:40] antichrist as the false prophet then the
[23:42] beast then in dark age
[23:44] and the church comes out of that dark
[23:46] age justification
[23:47] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[23:50] incarnate word the way now
[23:53] so those three stages was to bring god
[23:57] incarnate in the people justification
[24:00] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[24:02] ghost is the
[24:04] birth and the birth is god incarnate in
[24:07] his people
[24:10] and and the devil has worked his system
[24:12] down
[24:13] to where now she's rejected the word and
[24:15] he comes into her
[24:18] hallelujah but we come under the eagle
[24:22] anointing
[24:23] which is god himself
[24:27] the prophet and the children of god
[24:30] if god is an eagle his children are
[24:33] eagles
[24:35] hallelujah we've come through these
[24:38] these beasts these powers working
[24:40] through the church age but it's been
[24:41] building to something from the feet to
[24:43] the thighs to the legs to the shoulder
[24:45] it's building one it's building back the
[24:47] second masterpiece in the masterpiece
[24:49] family
[24:50] bringing back here the first half of the
[24:52] bible
[24:53] built to jesus christ the first part of
[24:55] the masterpiece
[24:56] then he took a piece off of that
[24:58] masterpiece to start making the second
[25:00] masterpiece
[25:01] and he's built it through seven church
[25:02] ages why he's building up the second
[25:05] masterpiece the male
[25:06] incarnation of god and the female
[25:09] incarnation of god
[25:10] and joining them together how hallelujah
[25:16] don't let anybody tell you you're
[25:17] insignificant you're a nobody
[25:20] that you're never going to make it
[25:22] that's the lie of the devil
[25:24] the message of the hour came to break
[25:26] your spiritual amnesia so you can see
[25:28] who you really are
[25:30] and this is who you really are amen
[25:33] you're not a nobody you're not washed up
[25:35] you're not
[25:35] beat down amen you are absolutely a
[25:38] child of god been redeemed by the blood
[25:40] of the god
[25:41] and has come to the true atonement no no
[25:44] no
[25:44] i'm just going to stop for a minute
[25:46] because we got to understand this
[25:47] you say the blood of jesus christ was
[25:49] the true atonement absolutely the blood
[25:51] of jesus christ is the true atonement
[25:53] but but but but but
[25:58] the word was made flesh
[26:02] the word before it was flesh it was the
[26:04] word
[26:05] and the word was made flesh and brother
[26:07] bennett said the word bled for you
[26:09] the word died for you you're saved by
[26:12] the bleeding
[26:13] bloody word
[26:14] [Music]
[26:16] the word amen the word is what bled for
[26:20] you the word
[26:21] that makes the bleeding of the word your
[26:23] atonement
[26:24] because now the word come down which you
[26:26] are a part of the word of god
[26:28] and that word come down and it all
[26:29] coalesced into one form
[26:31] and it was given an earthly blood and
[26:33] that blood was spilt for you it was the
[26:36] blood of the word
[26:40] so the blood of the word was spilt for
[26:42] you to redeem
[26:43] back all the word
[26:48] hallelujah and so now
[26:52] that that blood was spilled but when
[26:54] jesus spilt the blood and redeemed us
[26:56] back and paid the purchase price
[26:58] why didn't lucifer get destroyed why
[27:00] didn't he wrap everything up why wasn't
[27:02] it all finished then
[27:03] what have we been doing for the last
[27:04] 2000 years there's something more
[27:07] in redemption than just the calvary
[27:09] calvary paid the price
[27:11] there's nothing to be added to the price
[27:13] that was paid but redemption wasn't
[27:15] finished on calvary
[27:17] the price for redemption was paid at
[27:19] calvary
[27:20] but every attribute has to come to earth
[27:22] and be expressed to come into redemption
[27:25] [Applause]
[27:27] and so now you were saved by the blood
[27:30] that blood that dripped down was the
[27:31] blood of the word
[27:34] and the life that was in that word was
[27:36] released when the blood was spilled
[27:38] and the life of the word comes back to
[27:40] you the word
[27:41] to quicken the word that's inside of you
[27:46] hallelujah this you
[27:49] this has to register friends because now
[27:51] we have to understand why it's so
[27:53] important that the message came
[27:54] because now after that they're bloomed
[27:57] out of there
[27:58] a a church at pentecost amen this church
[28:01] had come under redemption
[28:02] the price was paid they had received the
[28:04] word and now they went out
[28:06] and they manifest what was taking place
[28:08] and the manifestation was doing the very
[28:11] same works that jesus christ did
[28:13] but something happened and they started
[28:15] to lose the word
[28:19] and when they started to lose the word
[28:21] amen they were losing
[28:23] something with atonement they were
[28:25] losing something with redemption
[28:27] because you're saved by the blood of the
[28:29] word
[28:33] and so now the lamb has been doing the
[28:36] work of kinsmen redeemer up behind the
[28:38] throne
[28:39] he's been sprinkling seven sprinklings
[28:41] of blood the cover for the ignorance of
[28:43] the
[28:44] people because the word was kept from
[28:46] them for generations
[28:47] and now they had to they had already
[28:49] been purchased they had to be preserved
[28:51] and they were being preserved by the
[28:53] lamb up there making atonement for them
[28:55] as a mediator
[28:56] saying they didn't mean it they don't
[28:58] know the word's been kept from them
[29:00] and he's mediating for them all the time
[29:02] but because the word was lost
[29:04] in order for us to come back to full
[29:06] redemption claims
[29:08] and for the atonement to be in full
[29:09] effect there has to be a return of the
[29:12] whole word
[29:13] and until there's a return of the whole
[29:15] word we have to hold in this
[29:17] pattern where the the lamb is up there
[29:20] as kinsmen redeemer
[29:21] covering for ignorance covering for
[29:23] ignorance covering for ignorance
[29:24] but god doesn't want him always covering
[29:27] for ignorance
[29:28] because the purpose is redemption
[29:30] redemption is to bring
[29:32] back to its former state reconciliation
[29:34] and redemption brother benham ties
[29:36] together
[29:37] redemption is to purchase back and
[29:39] reconciliation is to return to afford a
[29:41] former state
[29:42] so now you cannot come to god's mind for
[29:46] redemption
[29:47] to the purpose of the blood of atonement
[29:49] can never be fulfilled until there's a
[29:51] full return of the word
[29:55] and brother banham said the foolish
[29:57] virgin has to go into the tribulation
[29:59] for the purging amen
[30:01] because they refuse to accept the
[30:03] atonement in its
[30:04] fullness he said the atonement in its
[30:08] fullness
[30:08] the word because when the word was
[30:12] restored at the opening of the seals in
[30:14] 1963
[30:15] now the full measure of atonement has
[30:18] come to the church
[30:19] and now the full effect of the blood has
[30:22] come to the church
[30:24] they were under partial partial partial
[30:26] yes they were being saved
[30:27] yes they were redeemed yes they're going
[30:29] to come forth in the resurrection but
[30:30] they had lost that life that they had at
[30:32] pentecost
[30:33] they had lost the power and the
[30:34] manifestation they had at pentecost
[30:36] because that's when they had the full
[30:38] revelation of the word
[30:39] but when they lost the word they lost
[30:41] the power and there was somebody up
[30:43] there covering for their ignorance
[30:45] until a time when the promised son would
[30:48] return
[30:51] because he said he said thy seed
[30:54] shall bruise his head and brother
[30:57] branham said
[30:58] he gave a substitute and that substitute
[31:02] was laying there paying a price
[31:03] until that full promise of the seed of
[31:06] the woman come into manifestation
[31:09] and when that full promise of the seed
[31:11] of the woman come into manifestation
[31:13] now it was time to do away with the
[31:15] substitute because
[31:17] now that promise that prophecy that was
[31:19] given in genesis 3
[31:21] is now standing on the earth ready to
[31:23] take its place
[31:24] and when he takes his place and he dies
[31:26] and sheds his blood
[31:27] now the prophecy is fulfilled but
[31:30] remember everything in the bible happens
[31:32] twice
[31:34] moses smote the rock twice jesus was
[31:36] crucified twice
[31:38] and now now brother brenham says very
[31:41] clearly when you read through the seals
[31:42] book
[31:43] very clearly brother branham says now
[31:45] what happened is satan came
[31:47] in again and did what he did in eden
[31:51] and he deceived this early church and
[31:53] when he deceived this early church
[31:55] amen now they had compromised on the
[31:57] word
[31:58] and now there had to be a promise of the
[32:00] full measure of the seed of the woman to
[32:02] come back again and make it right
[32:05] and so now they're going through partial
[32:06] partial partial partial
[32:08] amen and they go through partial partial
[32:10] partial but there's got to come a time
[32:13] that the seed of the woman returns
[32:15] because the read full redemption is only
[32:18] in the full word
[32:21] you can't have partial it's got to be
[32:23] full amen
[32:25] he said moses was christ in a type all
[32:27] the prophets were building up what were
[32:29] they building
[32:30] as they come through the old testament
[32:31] they come through the psalms they come
[32:33] through the prophets they were building
[32:34] back the image of christ
[32:36] bringing back more word upon more word
[32:38] upon more word
[32:39] but there could not be atonement till
[32:41] the full word himself came
[32:43] and then that full word was lost but the
[32:46] blood was up there
[32:47] amen making atonement covering amen
[32:49] mediating for the sins of the people
[32:51] that were redeemed under that covenant
[32:54] but it had to build back again through
[32:56] legs i
[32:57] had to come back to full word again
[33:00] that's why the message is so critical
[33:02] that's why there was a prophet on the
[33:03] scene that's why there's an opening of
[33:05] the seals
[33:06] that's why redemption has been explained
[33:08] because it's got to come back to the
[33:10] full
[33:10] measure of the word again
[33:14] hallelujah this wasn't just something
[33:17] little neat thing that god was doing
[33:20] god had promised to do this all the way
[33:22] back in genesis 3 and
[33:24] the opening of the seals was fulfilling
[33:25] genesis 3
[33:29] the seed of the woman was coming back
[33:31] into manifestation again
[33:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[33:38] the word was lost the word had to come
[33:40] the word was lost the word had to come
[33:43] hallelujah oh
[33:46] praise god now do you see yourself
[33:49] friends
[33:50] amen you're the one who sees this you're
[33:52] the one who believes this
[33:53] when it came to your door you didn't
[33:55] reject it but you accepted it
[33:57] and you found your identification right
[33:59] there making you a part of that word
[34:01] that bled and died that's why you were
[34:03] with him when he hung on calvary
[34:05] because you were part of that word amen
[34:07] that's why you were with him when he
[34:09] came down in a cloud on sunset mountain
[34:11] because you're part of that word
[34:12] that's why when he preached the seals
[34:14] you were right there in the seals amen
[34:17] because your name is in that sealed book
[34:20] and when he was preaching the seals it
[34:21] awakens something in you because you're
[34:23] part of the seals
[34:25] [Applause]
[34:27] why is it so easy for you to accept and
[34:29] somebody next door can't even see it
[34:31] makes no sense because it's for you
[34:35] you're part of that word this message
[34:37] had to come
[34:38] a prophet had to come the seals had to
[34:40] be taken off
[34:41] so that we can move into the full
[34:44] benefit of the atonement amen
[34:46] because the bleeding bloody word bled
[34:48] for you and died for you and without
[34:50] that full word you can't get full
[34:52] benefit of that blood
[34:53] but with the full word comes full
[34:55] benefit of the blood
[35:00] hallelujah oh
[35:03] my god it's good friends
[35:06] many prophets and wise men would have
[35:09] loved to see your day
[35:12] they could only see parts and pieces and
[35:15] they had puzzle pieces and
[35:16] they were trying to get them put
[35:18] together and they wanted so bad to see
[35:20] what you see
[35:26] for sealed brother brandon says but now
[35:28] when it comes forth the eagle age that's
[35:30] the one that god always likens his
[35:31] prophets to eagles
[35:33] he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes
[35:36] so high there ain't nothing else can
[35:37] touch him not only is he
[35:39] up there but he's built for that
[35:40] position when he gets up there he sees
[35:43] where he's at
[35:44] some people get up there can't see where
[35:45] they're at so don't do no good to get up
[35:47] there
[35:49] brother braham says god claims himself
[35:51] to be jehovah eagle
[35:53] he's eagle himself he's papa eagle and
[35:56] we're little eaglets
[35:57] his children remember we talked about
[36:00] a little while ago we were talking about
[36:02] why does brother branham tell that story
[36:04] of the eagle in the chicken yard
[36:06] over and over and over again
[36:09] we're starting to realize these aren't
[36:10] stories these are parables
[36:13] jesus told parables amen and the
[36:14] parables were the mysteries of the
[36:16] kingdom
[36:16] amen and brother branham is not just
[36:18] telling cutesy stories
[36:20] he's giving parables that are the
[36:21] mystery of the kingdom and the mystery
[36:23] of the kingdom is that egg was
[36:25] always always always an eagle
[36:31] and it came out of its first position
[36:33] which was
[36:34] up high and the cleft of the rock
[36:38] and it was brought down to earth amen
[36:42] and it hatched out and was in spiritual
[36:45] amnesia it had not no idea what kind of
[36:47] creature it was
[36:48] it had no idea how it got here all it
[36:51] knew was all it had experienced in this
[36:53] earth
[36:54] coming from the lofty heights of a cleft
[36:56] of a rock coming down
[36:57] from the mountain to the earth and down
[37:00] on the earth it hatches out
[37:02] and it's just trying to live like all
[37:04] the other birds live
[37:06] chickens in the chicken yard scratching
[37:09] and eating meal and eating worms and
[37:11] and all this stuff and he's always a bit
[37:13] of a misfit amen
[37:15] but there had to come something
[37:17] something had to come
[37:19] to awaken him to his true self
[37:24] amen and what was it it was a creature
[37:26] just like him
[37:27] only fully mature and that fully mature
[37:30] creature flew over and screamed out
[37:32] what was the scream it was the voice of
[37:35] the fourth beast
[37:36] [Applause]
[37:38] and the voice of the fourth beat this
[37:40] called you and you looked up
[37:42] and when you looked up you said my
[37:44] that's me
[37:45] that's what i am i'm identified with
[37:48] that and all of a sudden you said but
[37:50] how
[37:50] how can i do this he said just jump
[37:54] just jump and flap your wings and you
[37:55] jump a little bit and you land on the
[37:57] post
[37:58] and you flap around a little bit before
[37:59] you know it you're flying in the
[38:01] heavenly
[38:02] going back to the position that you were
[38:04] formally in
[38:05] going back from where you were when you
[38:07] were taken out of the nest
[38:08] and put down the hatch out on earth now
[38:11] through the process you're going
[38:12] right back to where you came from what
[38:15] do you think the rapture what do you
[38:16] think that takes you to a new home
[38:21] the rapture takes you back home
[38:22] [Applause]
[38:24] hallelujah when that eagle lifted off
[38:26] the ground to fly it wasn't going to a
[38:28] new home
[38:29] it was going back to its original home
[38:31] only it had no recollection of that
[38:33] place
[38:34] amen it came down here and it had no
[38:36] memory of where it was before
[38:38] but when something screamed there was a
[38:40] familiar something in the heart
[38:42] and it was being called back to the
[38:44] place that it came from
[38:47] hallelujah this is why brother branham
[38:50] said
[38:50] i could preach on them seals for a month
[38:52] amen and still not touch at all
[38:56] hallelujah i haven't even gotten close
[38:59] to where i'm supposed
[39:00] to be and this clock says 899.
[39:07] hallelujah
[39:13] praise the lord that reminds me of
[39:15] something i just want to share something
[39:17] with you it might not mean a
[39:18] a hill of beans but it was interesting
[39:20] to me i was studying about this 144 000
[39:23] because that's really important after
[39:25] the fourth seal when the beast starts
[39:27] riding
[39:28] and the 144 000 is the calling out of
[39:30] the jews and i'm looking at that
[39:32] and all of a sudden the thought strikes
[39:33] me how many jews are on the planet today
[39:38] so i pulled it up i went and looked i
[39:40] pulled it up and there was an article
[39:42] in israel national news and they had
[39:44] they got the number
[39:45] and when i looked it up it said 14.4
[39:48] million
[39:49] 144.
[39:54] god's calling out a hundred and forty
[39:56] four thousand one four
[39:57] four and when i pulled up the census how
[39:59] many jews are on the earth today
[40:02] there's one four point four one
[40:06] four four i almost fainted
[40:11] i said this may not mean anything but to
[40:13] me right now i feel like rapturing
[40:17] i feel like how what are the odds it
[40:19] wasn't 14.5
[40:20] 15.4 144.
[40:26] those things get me excited
[40:29] i believe we're in the last days i
[40:32] believe we've come to the moment
[40:34] that we've all been waiting for
[40:39] this completes the battle friends if you
[40:42] notice
[40:43] this completes the battle the eagle
[40:46] anointing
[40:47] facing off against the pale horse
[40:49] incarnation
[40:50] completes the battle the spiritual
[40:53] battle between the two forces
[40:54] the devil incarnate and his bride in his
[40:57] church god incarnate in his
[40:59] amen and they all gather around trying
[41:01] to shut up the bride
[41:03] is that true this is before the devil is
[41:05] incarnate and the beast
[41:07] they build the world council of churches
[41:09] the ecumenical move they unite together
[41:11] and they come to close down these
[41:12] churches in churches like this and they
[41:14] gather around to shut her up but she'll
[41:16] never be shut up she'll be taken out
[41:18] and just about when they're about to uh
[41:21] succeed in their cowardly deed
[41:22] he snatches them away
[41:26] amen friends it's the eagle facing the
[41:29] pale horse amen
[41:31] it's life facing death spiritual death
[41:33] and spiritual life
[41:34] facing off again in the spiritual battle
[41:36] of armageddon and then when we go up he
[41:39] comes down
[41:39] and christ returns incarnate jesus
[41:42] christ himself
[41:43] to finish the battle we're in a battle
[41:46] right now and the final forces are
[41:48] facing off
[41:51] you know what that means i hope you
[41:54] catch this
[41:56] we've come all the way through this
[41:58] battle that started in heaven and came
[42:00] to earth
[42:01] we've come all the way to the end when
[42:03] brother branham said
[42:04] what have we come to we've come back
[42:07] this is what he says
[42:08] we have come back to satan and his
[42:11] angels
[42:12] and michael and his angels that's where
[42:15] we
[42:15] are right now we have come back
[42:19] to this original battle in heaven now
[42:21] we're facing it
[42:22] right now
[42:26] what does that mean that means you
[42:30] are the greatest fighting force this
[42:32] earth has ever seen
[42:38] cannot lose an invincible
[42:42] army by what by revelation my revelation
[42:46] of what the seals
[42:48] my revelation of the whole book my
[42:50] revelation we've come to a position amen
[42:53] where we realize what we are facing we
[42:55] don't fight against flesh and blood
[42:58] what do you think these scriptures are
[42:59] referring to and no soldier entangles
[43:01] him thinks himself with the things of
[43:03] the world put on the whole armor of god
[43:05] amen finally taking the sword of the
[43:07] spirit which is the word of god
[43:08] amen and there's a sword coming out of
[43:10] the mouth of jesus christ
[43:12] which he smites the nations and destroys
[43:13] his enemy what is all this talking about
[43:16] spiritual warfare the battle in heaven
[43:18] spilled down the earth and now it's come
[43:20] right back brother man said we have come
[43:22] back now
[43:22] we have come back to the devil and his
[43:25] angels and michael and his angels
[43:31] that means you're the elite fighting
[43:33] force
[43:37] you're not god didn't put you here in
[43:40] luther's day
[43:41] he didn't put you here in irenaeus's day
[43:43] he didn't bring you here
[43:44] to face a partial power of the devil he
[43:47] brought you at a time
[43:48] he ordained the attribute inside of you
[43:50] to arrive at a time
[43:52] to be awakened under not a partial word
[43:53] but a full word
[43:55] to face not a partial devil but a full
[43:57] devil
[44:02] and he gave you everything you need to
[44:03] overcome with because there's only one
[44:05] weapon that's the word
[44:06] and you don't have a short word you have
[44:09] the full word
[44:10] [Applause]
[44:11] hallelujah oh friends
[44:14] we've got to wake up and recognize where
[44:16] we are amen this is where we are
[44:19] you are put here to defeat the devil

[44:23] is to overcome the enemy that's the only
[44:26] purpose in this life
[44:27] is you overcome the enemy you'll
[44:28] overcome him in your workplace you

[44:35] crisis you'll overcome him
[44:37] in catastrophe you are here to overcome
[44:39] him and everything he throws your way
[44:41] you are here to put it under your feet
[44:43] [Applause]
[44:45] you're here for the full word to defeat
[44:48] satan i am far from where i need to be
[44:52] will you be patient with me i'll tell
[44:55] you what if you've got to slip
[44:56] out you won't hurt my feelings at all i
[44:58] know people have to work kids have to go
[44:59] to school
[45:00] but there's something i'm desperate to
[45:01] get to
[45:04] isaiah 14 hour thou fallen from heaven o
[45:09] lucifer sun of the morning
[45:10] how art thou cut down to the ground
[45:12] which is weak in the nations
[45:14] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[45:15] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[45:18] throne above the stars of god
[45:19] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[45:21] congregation and the sides of the north
[45:23] i will ascend above the heights of the
[45:25] clouds i will be like the most high
[45:28] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[45:31] to the sides of the pit here this starts
[45:34] off in verse 12
[45:35] with acknowledging that lucifer is
[45:38] fallen from heaven
[45:40] right how art thou fallen
[45:43] from heaven o lucifer
[45:46] so in isaiah we find a fallen lucifer
[45:50] who's fallen
[45:51] let's go to ezekiel chapter 28 if we
[45:54] could turn there together
[45:56] just want to slow down for a minute and
[45:57] just lay this in
[46:00] ezekiel 28
[46:06] verse 12.
[46:14] ezekiel 28 12 son of man
[46:17] take up a lamentation against the king
[46:18] of tyrus
[46:20] and say unto him thus saith the lord god
[46:22] thou sealest of the sum full of wisdom
[46:24] and perfect in beauty
[46:26] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[46:29] every precious stone was thy covering
[46:31] this artist topaz and the diamond the
[46:33] barrel the onyx and the jasper the
[46:35] sapphire the emerald
[46:36] the carbuncle and the gold the
[46:38] workmanship of thy tablets and of thy
[46:39] pipes was prepared in the in the day
[46:41] that thou was created
[46:42] thou art the anointed cherub that
[46:45] covereth and i have set thee so
[46:48] that was upon the holy mountain of god
[46:49] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[46:51] of the stones of fire
[46:53] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[46:55] day that thou was created till iniquity
[46:57] was found in thee
[46:58] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[47:00] they have filled the midst of thee with
[47:02] violence
[47:03] and thou has sinned therefore i will
[47:05] cast thee as profane out of the mountain
[47:07] of god
[47:08] and i will destroy thee o covering
[47:10] cherub from the midst of the stones of
[47:11] fire
[47:12] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[47:14] beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[47:17] reason of thy brightness i will cast
[47:18] thee to the ground
[47:19] i will lay thee before kings that they
[47:21] may behold thee
[47:22] thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the
[47:25] multitude of thine iniquities
[47:26] by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore
[47:28] will i bring forth a fire from the midst
[47:30] of thee
[47:31] it shall devour thee and i will bring
[47:32] thee to i will bring
[47:34] thee to ashes upon the earth and the
[47:36] sight of all them that behold thee
[47:38] all they that know thee among the people
[47:40] shall be astonished at thee
[47:42] thou shalt be a terror and never shalt
[47:44] thou be any more
[47:47] never shalt thou be any more
[47:50] so we see in isaiah 14 we see lucifer
[47:54] cast down fallen from heaven all right
[47:57] but we see an ezekiel a future casting
[48:01] down
[48:01] and destruction do we got that
[48:05] so he's already fallen in isaiah in
[48:08] isaiah chapter 14.
[48:10] he's already fallen but here
[48:13] in ezekiel god says you've been in eden
[48:16] amen
[48:17] you've you've rebelled and i'm going to
[48:20] destroy you
[48:21] and you shall be no more and he's
[48:23] speaking of a future time
[48:25] all right
[48:29] brother ben says
[48:32] this great first battle that was ever
[48:34] fought begin in heaven
[48:36] when michael and his angels fought
[48:37] against lucifer and his angels
[48:39] it first started the first battle was in
[48:41] heaven so sin
[48:43] did not originate on earth it originated
[48:46] in heaven this is super important that
[48:49] we catch this
[48:50] sin did not when we talk about original
[48:52] sin we've got to be careful that's
[48:53] original sin upon the earth
[48:55] but the original sin happened in heaven
[48:57] and when it was thrown down from heaven
[48:59] cast out of him into the earth and fell
[49:01] on human beings
[49:02] then the battle from angels became human
[49:05] battles
[49:06] and satan come to destroy god's creation
[49:08] what god had created to be for himself
[49:10] he had satan come to destroy this that's
[49:13] what this purpose was was to destroy it
[49:15] then the battle began here on earth and
[49:18] begin
[49:18] in us and has been raging ever
[49:22] since hallelujah
[49:25] it went from the battle from angels to
[49:28] humans
[49:31] it's an old battle that started way back
[49:33] beyond time is out of the seventh seal
[49:36] and satan and his angels was kicked out
[49:38] and then they come to earth and the
[49:40] battle set in and again because eve
[49:41] broke down the barrier from where she
[49:43] was
[49:43] isolated behind the word of god and from
[49:45] that very hour
[49:47] satan won the battle over god's word
[49:55] now if satan comes down and through
[49:58] deception
[49:59] gets the children of god amen to
[50:02] to break down and let down on the word
[50:05] then satan has
[50:06] victory over the word so the battle has
[50:10] always been
[50:10] over the word because satan could not
[50:14] rebel
[50:15] unless he was rebelling against a
[50:17] commandment
[50:19] he could not rebel unless he was
[50:21] rebelling against the word
[50:23] i'll show you that in just a minute
[50:27] he won satan won the battle over god's
[50:30] word because
[50:31] one of his subjects the weaker let down
[50:33] the bar and that's exactly how he's won
[50:35] the battle
[50:36] every time has been because one of his
[50:38] subjects let down the bar
[50:40] from the word not two it doesn't take
[50:42] two it takes one
[50:44] one of his subjects letting down on the
[50:45] word
[50:47] satan has victory over the word of god
[50:51] so glad god's predestinated a bride that
[50:53] won't fall
[50:55] if he hadn't predestinated you would
[50:57] never make it
[51:00] you're not smarter than eve you're not
[51:02] stronger than eve amen
[51:04] you're not in any better position the
[51:06] only thing that separates you from her
[51:07] is your predestinated position in the
[51:09] mind of god to overcome in this last day
[51:12] and you shall not be defeated
[51:15] why because he said so because he
[51:18] decreed it because he promised it
[51:20] because he's going to have a bride
[51:21] without spot or wrinkle amen that's why
[51:24] you're going to overcome in this day
[51:27] see so many times when you get into this
[51:29] position where we think this just can't
[51:30] be me
[51:31] this just can't be for me amen i'm going
[51:33] to let down on the word i'm going to
[51:34] fail
[51:35] oh my goodness what's happening now is
[51:37] the devil is tricking you to look at
[51:39] yourself
[51:41] but you fail to remember god's not
[51:43] looking at you god's looking at the lamb
[51:48] so why are you looking at you you need
[51:50] to be looking at the lamb
[51:51] and if you're looking at the same thing
[51:53] god's looking at you're going to see
[51:55] there's no
[51:55] blemish no blemish
[51:59] on that sacrifice that means under that
[52:02] sacrifice
[52:03] i have no blemish
[52:07] oh that takes a revelation that comes by
[52:11] faith
[52:12] you can look and you can look at all
[52:14] your faults and everything that's wrong
[52:16] with you
[52:16] but the god is not looking at your
[52:18] faults and not looking at you
[52:20] because if god looked at you he could
[52:21] not accept you
[52:24] he has to look at the lamb and because
[52:27] the lamb is perfect
[52:28] you're perfect
[52:29] [Applause]
[52:31] the word is perfect you're perfect the
[52:34] lamb
[52:35] is the word the word is perfect you're
[52:37] perfect
[52:38] you're saved by the blood of the word
[52:40] making you
[52:41] perfect by the blood of the word and
[52:44] when you receive the word amen
[52:46] and you receive the spirit of that word
[52:48] you are now washed in the water of the
[52:50] word and you are
[52:51] perfect by the word
[52:53] [Applause]
[52:56] not by your flesh not by the deeds that
[52:59] you do amen you are
[53:00] perfected by your faith in the word
[53:04] and it has nothing to do with your deeds
[53:06] your deeds are the works that you give
[53:08] back to god because you love him amen
[53:10] because you believe what he said about
[53:12] you and that puts in you such a love
[53:15] that his commandments are not grievous
[53:16] unto you you can't wait to do what he
[53:19] says
[53:19] but has never been based your atonement
[53:22] has never been based on your deeds
[53:26] your deeds are an evidence of your faith
[53:33] hallelujah somebody's going to go free
[53:38] somebody is going to quit being beat
[53:40] down by the devil
[53:42] and somebody is going to quit looking in
[53:45] the mirror to find out whether they're
[53:46] worthy or not
[53:47] somebody in this room is going to quit
[53:49] looking at themselves
[53:51] and start looking at the atonement and
[53:52] looking at the lamb and say if god
[53:54] accepts that he's got to accept me
[53:56] because i believe in that and i believe
[53:58] i'm part of that and i believe it's shed
[54:00] for me
[54:01] i'm part of the word and the word died
[54:03] and the word bled and i've accepted the
[54:05] fullness of the word
[54:06] and if the word is perfect i have to be
[54:09] perfect
[54:11] somebody is going to go free because
[54:13] it's based off faith
[54:15] and when you believe that that puts you
[54:17] back in your virgin condition
[54:19] it puts you back in your original state
[54:25] hallelujah
[54:34] look what this is all coming to what is
[54:36] it it's going right back
[54:38] the way it did we're coming right back
[54:41] to what started in heaven
[54:44] we are marching right back to the same
[54:47] battle that was fought in heaven
[54:49] we're coming right back to it friends
[54:52] something went wrong in heaven and god
[54:55] has chosen
[54:56] to use this that we're going through now
[54:58] to fix what went wrong there
[55:01] and we're coming right back to that
[55:04] battle
[55:06] the first thing in heaven was a battle
[55:09] lucifer was kicked out and come to the
[55:10] earth and he polluted eden
[55:12] then he's been polluting it ever since
[55:14] now from the battle in heaven it's come
[55:15] to the battle on earth and it's to be
[55:17] finished on earth at the time in a
[55:19] battle called armageddon
[55:20] now anyone knows that the battle started
[55:22] in heaven and so they kicked him out
[55:25] michael and his angels overthrew them
[55:27] just run out
[55:28] and when they did it dropped right down
[55:30] in eden and here started the battle
[55:32] down here you got that
[55:36] so there was a war in heaven and when
[55:39] michael and his angels overcame them
[55:41] they cast them out and lucifer the devil
[55:43] came down into eden
[55:45] and in eden he started the work all over
[55:47] again
[55:50] hallelujah
[55:54] let's look in the bible actually i want
[55:56] to read a quote
[56:00] that day on calvary 1960 sin did not
[56:03] start on earth sin
[56:04] started in heaven how many sure of that
[56:06] now
[56:08] lucifer the devil was a condemned
[56:10] creature for his disobedience before he
[56:12] ever struck the earth
[56:15] you got that lucifer the devil was a
[56:19] condemned creature before his
[56:20] disobedience before he ever struck the
[56:22] earth
[56:22] sin began in heaven where god put the
[56:24] angels and so forth upon the same bases
[56:26] that he put human beings on
[56:30] knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree
[56:32] of life and the tree of knowledge where
[56:33] man could take his choice and when
[56:35] lucifer was given the preeminences to
[56:37] make his choice
[56:38] he wanted something better than god had
[56:41] that started the trouble
[56:44] friends what is he saying he's saying
[56:47] what took place in eden
[56:49] had already taken place in heaven
[56:53] that they were given a choice and the
[56:56] choice was between
[56:57] two trees knowledge
[57:02] of good and evil and life
[57:05] and every and satan lucifer was given
[57:07] the preeminence to make his choice
[57:09] and he wanted something better than what
[57:11] he was given
[57:13] see that's why when we see something
[57:15] take place in eden it's only reflecting
[57:17] what just happened
[57:19] let's go to genesis chapter 3. let's
[57:21] look at this together i want you to see
[57:23] this very clearly in your mind
[57:27] see brother branham is never ever just
[57:29] pulling something out of his hat
[57:32] he's a word prophet and he's talking the
[57:34] word in genesis chapter 3
[57:36] verse 22 after the fall god had dealt
[57:40] with judgment
[57:40] he had done all this and he said in the
[57:42] lord god said behold
[57:44] the man is become as one of us to know
[57:47] good and evil
[57:51] what happened what had just taken place
[57:54] in heaven
[57:55] now took place on the earth and after
[57:58] man fell by disobeying god's word
[58:00] god says man has become like one of us
[58:04] the heavenly host
[58:06] knowing good and evil the battle in
[58:09] heaven
[58:09] had spilled out to the earth what
[58:11] happened there had just happened down
[58:13] here
[58:14] who was god speaking to he was talking
[58:16] to the heavenly host
[58:19] man has just gone through what we just
[58:21] went through
[58:24] do you see that
[58:27] the lord god sent him it says in the
[58:29] lord god said behold the man has become
[58:32] as one of us to know good and evil and
[58:35] now lest he put forth his hand and take
[58:37] also the tree of life and eat and live
[58:39] forever
[58:40] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[58:42] from the garden of eden to till the
[58:43] ground from whence he was taken
[58:45] so he drove the man out and placed at
[58:46] the east of the garden of eden cherubims
[58:49] and the flaming sword which turned every
[58:51] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[58:54] now listen friends i want you to i want
[58:56] you just to pay attention to me for a
[58:58] minute to catch this
[59:01] god and his mercy would not let the man
[59:05] live forever
[59:06] once he had tasted this tree
[59:11] why because now man had become like
[59:16] us god says speaking to the heavenly
[59:19] host
[59:19] man has become like us knowing good and
[59:21] evil
[59:23] but god in his mercy wouldn't let man
[59:25] live forever that way
[59:28] why because heaven was stuck in that
[59:30] condition
[59:33] heaven is stuck in that condition
[59:36] and something about redemption on earth
[59:38] is going to fix that problem
[59:42] god moves him away from the tree of life
[59:44] until atonement is made
[59:46] because the man cannot live forever in
[59:48] this fallen condition why
[59:49] because heaven has had a rebellion
[59:52] heaven has had a rebellion against god
[59:54] heaven has had a war and now these
[59:56] subjects are cast out to the earth amen
[59:59] and now man has become like one of us
[1:00:01] and lest he take the tree of life and
[1:00:03] live forever
[1:00:03] i'm not going to let him i'm going to
[1:00:05] forbid it
[1:00:06] that's the mercy of god something was
[1:00:09] wrong
[1:00:10] in heaven something went wrong in heaven
[1:00:13] but something is going to be made right
[1:00:18] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:00:29] you have to ask yourself a question
[1:00:35] when satan came down he went to eden
[1:00:39] but brother branham said under this
[1:00:41] fourth seal
[1:00:42] when the bride goes up where does satan
[1:00:44] go
[1:00:46] now i thought satan already came down i
[1:00:49] thought satan was already cast out of
[1:00:50] heaven
[1:00:51] why do we see him cast out of heaven
[1:00:53] twice
[1:00:55] right he says satan you've fallen from
[1:00:59] heaven
[1:00:59] you've been in eden amen there was a
[1:01:02] battle in heaven brother bam said it
[1:01:03] come down to eden
[1:01:04] but after it goes through when the
[1:01:06] rapture takes place when the bride goes
[1:01:07] up
[1:01:08] now satan comes down amen let's look at
[1:01:10] revelations chapter 12
[1:01:11] together there's a clue in there that
[1:01:13] you'll find out what he's doing there
[1:01:16] you have to ask yourself if he's cast
[1:01:18] out if he's lost his position have you
[1:01:20] fallen to earth
[1:01:21] what is he doing in heaven
[1:01:24] and revelation chapter 12 will tell you
[1:01:26] what he's doing in heaven
[1:01:29] revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and there
[1:01:32] was war in heaven michael and his angels
[1:01:34] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[1:01:36] fought in his angels
[1:01:37] and prevailed not neither was their
[1:01:38] place found any more in heaven
[1:01:40] and the great great dragon was cast out
[1:01:43] that old serpent called the devil
[1:01:44] and satan which deceiveth the whole
[1:01:46] world he was cast out in the earth and
[1:01:49] his angels were cast out with him
[1:01:51] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:01:52] heaven now is come salvation
[1:01:54] and strength and the kingdom of our god
[1:01:56] and the power of his christ
[1:01:58] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:02:00] down which secures them before our god
[1:02:03] day and night and they overcame him by
[1:02:05] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:02:07] their testimony
[1:02:08] and they love not their lives unto death
[1:02:11] therefore rejoice you heavens
[1:02:12] and ye that dwell in them woe into the
[1:02:14] inhabitants of the earth and of the sea
[1:02:16] for the devil has come down unto you
[1:02:18] having great wrath because he knoweth
[1:02:20] that is
[1:02:20] that he hath but a short time
[1:02:24] so here after the rapture we're seeing
[1:02:26] satan
[1:02:27] cast out of heaven again
[1:02:31] satan's cast out of heaven where does he
[1:02:33] go he goes to eden
[1:02:34] after god's children fall through
[1:02:36] deception and disobey the word
[1:02:38] now we find him back in heaven in the
[1:02:41] book of job it says when there was a day
[1:02:43] that the sons of god presented
[1:02:44] themselves unto god
[1:02:45] satan also came and presented himself
[1:02:49] so now we see a satan fallen from heaven
[1:02:51] but now we find him back in heaven
[1:02:53] what's he doing in heaven
[1:02:56] what's his title in revelations chapter
[1:02:59] 12 he's the accuser of the brethren
[1:03:04] before adam has fallen before man had
[1:03:06] fallen there was a
[1:03:07] nothing to accuse the children of god
[1:03:10] for but when man
[1:03:11] fell now he becomes the accuser of the
[1:03:14] brethren
[1:03:15] he was given his position because of the
[1:03:17] fall of man
[1:03:20] because when he comes down he has a
[1:03:22] title he's the accuser of the brethren
[1:03:25] before the fall he could not accuse the
[1:03:27] brethren
[1:03:29] do you understand that so what causes
[1:03:33] him to cast down
[1:03:34] when is he fallen when does he lose his
[1:03:36] position when he can no longer accuse
[1:03:38] the brethren
[1:03:41] amen he's losing his position by faith
[1:03:43] and the atonement
[1:03:44] by the full word bringing full atonement
[1:03:46] rights to the people
[1:03:48] he's losing his grip on his position
[1:03:50] because the children of god are coming
[1:03:52] to a place
[1:03:52] where he has nothing to accuse them of
[1:03:55] because the only thing he can accuse
[1:03:56] them of is disbelief
[1:03:58] in the word that's the only sin is
[1:04:01] disbelieving the word
[1:04:02] smoking drinking adultery is not sin sin
[1:04:05] is disbelieving the word
[1:04:06] amen the original sin in the garden of
[1:04:08] eden was not adultery the original sin
[1:04:10] was disbelieving the word
[1:04:12] and now we're coming to a place by faith
[1:04:14] at the restoration of the full word
[1:04:16] bringing back the full life bringing
[1:04:18] back a perfect word for perfect faith
[1:04:19] for a perfect rapture
[1:04:21] now he has nothing to accuse them of and
[1:04:24] she goes up
[1:04:25] and he comes down
[1:04:28] that's how you're defeating satan by
[1:04:30] receiving the word
[1:04:32] amen not your muscles amen not your
[1:04:34] power not your brain
[1:04:36] but by receiving the humble word by
[1:04:38] receiving the full word of god
[1:04:40] you are absolutely causing him to lose
[1:04:42] his rights to his position in heaven
[1:04:44] the only right he has there was given to
[1:04:47] him in the garden of eden
[1:04:48] and we're coming to a place where we're
[1:04:50] going to receive the word she's
[1:04:51] predestinated not to fall
[1:04:54] you're predestinated not to disbelieve
[1:04:57] one word
[1:04:58] and when you come back to full faith in
[1:05:00] the full word
[1:05:01] he is utterly and completely defeated
[1:05:04] and loses his position
[1:05:07] and woe into the inhabitants of the
[1:05:09] earth
[1:05:11] for the devil has come down and he's
[1:05:13] angry
[1:05:14] because he knows he has but a short time
[1:05:18] because he cannot deceive the bride of
[1:05:21] christ anymore
[1:05:25] that's the battle you're in friends
[1:05:26] that's your victory it's a victory by
[1:05:28] faith in the word
[1:05:30] it's a perfect word bringing a perfect
[1:05:33] faith
[1:05:33] for a perfect rapture you're not going
[1:05:36] to find it you're not going to find a
[1:05:37] denominational doctrine you're not going
[1:05:39] to find it in theories of man
[1:05:40] you're not going to find it in the
[1:05:41] entertainments of the world there's only
[1:05:43] one place that you're going to find this
[1:05:45] overcoming power
[1:05:46] and it's in the revealed word of the
[1:05:47] hour and when you throw yourself
[1:05:49] completely into the revealed word of the
[1:05:51] hour that word brings a life
[1:05:53] that life brings a faith and brings you
[1:05:55] back to the original faith of the
[1:05:56] original fathers
[1:05:59] and that full faith in the full word
[1:06:01] causes him to
[1:06:02] utterly completely lose his position in
[1:06:06] heaven
[1:06:06] and he is cast down
[1:06:10] can i go a few more minutes amen
[1:06:13] let's just preach all night
[1:06:16] amen god is good there is nothing that
[1:06:20] gets me more excited than this
[1:06:21] there is nothing i love more than
[1:06:23] finding my position in the word
[1:06:25] and knowing that i i i have entered into
[1:06:28] the invincible army
[1:06:29] and god is building my faith to a place
[1:06:31] where i shall not be defeated
[1:06:33] because there's nothing in me that wants
[1:06:35] to disbelieve the word
[1:06:37] every time the words presented i want it
[1:06:39] and when more is presented i want more
[1:06:42] what is that that's the word coming to
[1:06:45] the word
[1:06:47] hallelujah
[1:06:50] praise god and they overcome him by the
[1:06:53] blood of the lamb
[1:06:54] and by the word of their testimony
[1:06:58] the word of their testimony that word
[1:07:00] testimony is more often than
[1:07:02] non-interpreted witness
[1:07:05] they overcome him by the blood of the
[1:07:07] lamb in the word
[1:07:09] of their witness against him
[1:07:16] listen they don't just overcome him by
[1:07:17] the blood of the lamb
[1:07:20] they overcome him by the blood of the
[1:07:21] lamb and the word
[1:07:24] of their witness
[1:07:27] this word witness is the same when it's
[1:07:29] used of john the baptist when he comes
[1:07:30] to forerun
[1:07:31] and witness of jesus christ
[1:07:34] testifying of jesus christ
[1:07:38] amen this is the same word witness when
[1:07:40] jesus says the works that i do they
[1:07:41] witness
[1:07:42] of me same witness
[1:07:46] you have a word of witness
[1:07:49] to testify against the devil
[1:07:53] hallelujah your life
[1:07:56] your testimony is testifying against him
[1:07:59] he's the accuser of the brethren your
[1:08:00] life is accusing him
[1:08:03] it's witnessing against him he cannot
[1:08:06] defeat this bride
[1:08:07] he cannot get her to disbelieve the word
[1:08:10] he cannot have victory on this one
[1:08:12] he's taking out that one and this one
[1:08:14] and this one but there's coming one
[1:08:16] that's standing on the earth
[1:08:17] that he will not have victory over
[1:08:20] because she will not disbelieve the word
[1:08:22] and when they come to that full
[1:08:23] manifestation of full faith in the word
[1:08:26] he has absolutely lost his position in
[1:08:28] that way
[1:08:29] he cannot stay and when the bride goes
[1:08:31] up he
[1:08:32] comes down let me tell you something
[1:08:36] the bride is going up
[1:08:40] we're not waiting for the bride to go up
[1:08:43] i'm waiting for my body to change but
[1:08:45] i've already gone up friends
[1:08:47] i've already been called out of laodicea

[1:08:55] the bride age my soul has been raptured
[1:08:57] to another realm

[1:09:02] not waiting for the rapture i'm right in
[1:09:03] the middle of the rapture
[1:09:05] i've went spiritually so that i can go
[1:09:07] physically
[1:09:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:14] we're raptured friends by the word
[1:09:17] calling us up higher
[1:09:19] in the dissension of christ and the lord
[1:09:22] shall descend with a shout with the
[1:09:24] voice of the archangel with the trump of
[1:09:26] god
[1:09:27] the lord himself shall descend
[1:09:30] when he comes to the shout we come up to
[1:09:33] the shout out
[1:09:37] his coming down is bringing us up
[1:09:41] the dissension of christ is the
[1:09:43] ascension of the bride

[1:09:47] you should already be living in heavenly
[1:09:49] places
[1:09:50] your thinking should already be leaving
[1:09:53] carnal thinking of the world
[1:09:54] and moving into heavenly places by the
[1:09:56] shout and the voice of the archangel and
[1:09:58] brother brenham says
[1:09:59] his voice is in her
[1:10:03] now the voice of the bridegroom is

[1:10:12] friends
[1:10:15] hallelujah i want to go just a
[1:10:18] couple more minutes let's turn to luke
[1:10:21] together
[1:10:21] luke chapter 10 this is we're getting
[1:10:24] into the meat right here friends
[1:10:40] luke chapter 10 verse 1 after these
[1:10:43] things the lord appointed
[1:10:44] other seventy also and sent them two and
[1:10:47] two before his face into every city and
[1:10:49] place
[1:10:49] whether he himself would come therefore
[1:10:52] said he unto them
[1:10:53] the harvest truly is great but the
[1:10:55] laborers are few pray you therefore the
[1:10:57] lord of the harvest that he would send
[1:10:58] forth laborers
[1:10:59] into the harvest go your ways behold i
[1:11:03] send you forth as lambs
[1:11:04] among wolves carry neither person or
[1:11:06] script nor shoes and salute no man by
[1:11:08] the way
[1:11:09] and unto whomsoever house she entered
[1:11:11] say first peace be to this house
[1:11:13] and if the son of peace be there your p
[1:11:15] shall rest upon it
[1:11:16] if not it shall return to you again
[1:11:18] don't stop reading there
[1:11:19] in the story brother ben is taking his
[1:11:21] disciples excuse me
[1:11:23] and he's taking them to 70 and he's
[1:11:25] going to send them out two by two
[1:11:26] and they're going to go out preaching
[1:11:27] the kingdom of god and preaching out
[1:11:29] amongst all these villages
[1:11:31] now jesus is not going his disciples are
[1:11:34] going
[1:11:36] you got that he himself is not going
[1:11:39] he's sending them out
[1:11:43] now let's go to verse 17 when they
[1:11:45] return
[1:11:46] and the seven the seventy returned again
[1:11:49] with joy saying lord
[1:11:50] even the devils are subject to unto us
[1:11:53] through thy name
[1:11:55] and he said unto them i beheld satan as
[1:11:58] lightning fall from heaven
[1:12:00] whoa what did he see
[1:12:04] satan fall from heaven when did he see
[1:12:07] satan fall from heaven when did
[1:12:11] jesus see satan fall from heaven when
[1:12:13] the 70 came back and says the devils
[1:12:15] were subject
[1:12:16] unto us he sent them out he himself
[1:12:19] didn't go
[1:12:20] he sent them out and when they did what
[1:12:22] he did
[1:12:23] jesus said i see satan as lightning fall
[1:12:25] from heaven
[1:12:27] what is what is causing the fall of
[1:12:29] satan is when the church is coming to
[1:12:31] its position
[1:12:32] and manifesting the very same thing that
[1:12:35] jesus christ manifested
[1:12:36] when they get to that place i see satan
[1:12:39] as lightning falling from heaven
[1:12:42] amen you're not called to be beaten down
[1:12:44] and trodden upon and be nobody in this
[1:12:46] earth
[1:12:46] you're here to take your position just
[1:12:48] like they did there remember
[1:12:50] everything in the word repeats and when
[1:12:52] jesus not himself
[1:12:53] calling casting out demons not himself
[1:12:56] overcoming the devils but when he sent
[1:12:58] out disciples two by two
[1:12:59] when they overcame it jesus testified
[1:13:02] that i
[1:13:02] saw satan as lightning fall from heaven
[1:13:08] it's you who cast him out friends
[1:13:11] it's you coming to the life of the word
[1:13:13] that cast him out he loses his position
[1:13:16] brother branham said in the message thy
[1:13:18] house it was immediately after jesus
[1:13:21] gave his disciples power against unclean
[1:13:23] spirits
[1:13:23] and then he they went out casting out
[1:13:25] devils sent them two by two
[1:13:27] he said don't go to the gentiles but go
[1:13:29] rather to the lost sheep of israel
[1:13:31] and as you go preaching them kingdoms of
[1:13:32] heaven and heal the sick and cast out
[1:13:34] devils and so forth
[1:13:35] then they come back rejoicing happily
[1:13:38] come back happily rejoicing and said he
[1:13:40] said rejoice not your
[1:13:41] your names rejoice not because devil's a
[1:13:43] subject in you but rejoice because your
[1:13:45] names are written in heaven
[1:13:46] he said i beheld satan falling from
[1:13:48] heaven like lightning
[1:13:50] see the power of that church moving
[1:13:53] forward had just
[1:13:54] upset the whole kingdom of satan
[1:13:58] friends we're supposed to be moving
[1:14:00] forward in the power of the holy ghost
[1:14:02] and the power of the word and when the
[1:14:05] power of the church moving forward had
[1:14:07] just
[1:14:07] upset the whole kingdom of satan you see
[1:14:10] and he saw him as he dropped from his
[1:14:12] places because god
[1:14:14] had again given power to his church he
[1:14:16] beheld him falling like lightning from
[1:14:18] heaven
[1:14:18] it was cast plum out of the holy places
[1:14:20] and everything the power
[1:14:22] the power of that church of them having
[1:14:24] power jesus said i give you power over
[1:14:26] unclean spirits and they really upset
[1:14:28] the kingdom of satan
[1:14:30] what could we do with it today oh praise
[1:14:33] the lord
[1:14:35] and friends we've got to expect these
[1:14:37] things
[1:14:39] because if we're going to upset the
[1:14:40] kingdom of heaven this church has to
[1:14:42] come back to its original condition like
[1:14:44] it was at pentecost
[1:14:45] pentecost is the example pentecost is
[1:14:48] the
[1:14:49] is the is the level of the church that
[1:14:50] we're working back to
[1:14:54] where did she fall from she fell from
[1:14:55] pentecost amen
[1:14:58] brother branham said in the acts of the
[1:14:59] holy spirit i tell you peter preached a
[1:15:02] sermon on the day of pentecost and 3 000
[1:15:04] souls were saved
[1:15:06] the devil the devil never even moved out
[1:15:08] of his bed
[1:15:11] pay attention the devil never even moved
[1:15:14] out of his bed that's right oh well let
[1:15:15] him alone see
[1:15:17] but he passed through the gate called
[1:15:18] beautiful the next day and healed a man
[1:15:21] crippled from his mother's womb
[1:15:22] and all hell turned loose on him throwed
[1:15:25] him in the jail and kept him overnight
[1:15:27] yes sir put him in the prison the inner
[1:15:29] cell there because the phenomenal
[1:15:30] the devil said i can't let this thing
[1:15:32] get started now divine healing if they
[1:15:34] do
[1:15:35] they'll really will knock my props out
[1:15:36] from under me that's right
[1:15:38] because i might fool them around with a
[1:15:39] little theology once in a while
[1:15:42] but i sure can't fool the real thing
[1:15:45] that comes out of the people
[1:15:46] see it done i'll just stop this before
[1:15:48] that other group gets on the scene 3 000
[1:15:52] people are converted in one day
[1:15:54] and and peter's never arrested they're
[1:15:56] not gunning for him they're not coming
[1:15:57] to arrest him and throw him in jail
[1:15:59] but he heals one lame man that is set by
[1:16:02] andy listen friends
[1:16:03] jesus walked through the gate beautiful
[1:16:09] and that man sat begging home from the
[1:16:11] time he was a child
[1:16:13] and they saw him daily at the gate
[1:16:15] begging arms there was a testimony that
[1:16:17] went out everybody knew him he was
[1:16:18] always at the gate beautiful
[1:16:20] jesus walks through the gate beautiful
[1:16:22] and doesn't heal this man
[1:16:23] because he's waiting for his church to
[1:16:25] do it
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:29] brother brahm said jesus didn't finish
[1:16:31] all his works when he was here on earth
[1:16:32] he left some of it for the church to
[1:16:34] complete
[1:16:36] jesus walking through the gate beautiful
[1:16:38] and he sees the man laying begging he
[1:16:40] says
[1:16:40] your time's coming i've got a redeemed
[1:16:43] seed that's going to be upon the earth
[1:16:45] they're going to receive the baptism of
[1:16:46] the holy ghost and my life in them
[1:16:48] is going to manifest amen what happened
[1:16:51] peter
[1:16:52] by peter healing that man not preaching
[1:16:54] to the 3000 and converting them but
[1:16:56] healing that man
[1:16:58] peter now vindicated the ministry of
[1:17:00] jesus christ
[1:17:02] because they knew that they were
[1:17:02] ignorant unlearned but they take note
[1:17:04] that they had been with jesus
[1:17:09] jesus didn't complete all of his works
[1:17:11] when he was here
[1:17:13] he left some of it for you to do
[1:17:16] yes hallelujah that makes me happy
[1:17:22] and the god of his evil age he said now
[1:17:24] we find this evil age is to prove to
[1:17:26] satan
[1:17:27] she is not like eve she is not that type
[1:17:30] of woman
[1:17:32] she will be tried by his word she will
[1:17:34] be
[1:17:35] tried by his word the bride as adam
[1:17:38] as adam's bride was tried by the word
[1:17:40] and adam's bride believed every bit of
[1:17:42] the word all but confused on one promise
[1:17:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:49] forever today see but failed on one
[1:17:51] promise
[1:17:52] under the temptation the enemy face to
[1:17:54] face
[1:17:55] listen to this under the temptation the
[1:17:57] enemy face to face she failed on one
[1:17:59] promise
[1:18:01] and now the people that's called for his
[1:18:02] name of course his bride
[1:18:05] she is to come in contact again by the
[1:18:07] same
[1:18:10] thing
[1:18:12] not just by denominational truth or
[1:18:14] something but
[1:18:15] every word she is coming down to the
[1:18:18] showdown
[1:18:19] face to face just like the garden of
[1:18:22] eden
[1:18:23] only she's predestinated not to fall
[1:18:28] and when she doesn't fall i see satan
[1:18:33] as lightning cast down
[1:18:40] praise god let's turn to first john
[1:18:44] chapter three
[1:18:45] i am very close to being done you guys
[1:18:48] are wonderful
[1:18:49] i love you all first john
[1:18:54] chapter 1 verse 3 or chapter 3 first
[1:18:56] john chapter 3 verse 8.
[1:19:05] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[1:19:08] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:19:10] stop the devil sinned from the beginning
[1:19:15] eden no heaven
[1:19:19] i got that so let's now now we're
[1:19:22] placing this
[1:19:23] the devil sinned from the beginning when
[1:19:25] he rebelled in heaven
[1:19:27] and when war broke out in heaven and for
[1:19:29] this
[1:19:30] purpose the son of god was manifested
[1:19:32] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:19:34] devil
[1:19:37] because the devil sinned from the
[1:19:39] beginning
[1:19:41] christ had to be manifest on the earth
[1:19:43] to destroy the works of the devil
[1:19:47] the earthly journey is fixing what went
[1:19:50] wrong in heaven
[1:19:52] the devil sent from the beginning for
[1:19:54] this purpose
[1:19:55] the son of god was manifest to destroy
[1:19:58] the works of the devil
[1:20:00] oh friends we got to see this earthly
[1:20:03] journey isn't a waste what we're doing
[1:20:05] we're in the battle and we're having
[1:20:06] victory and the victory we have
[1:20:08] the the lucifer will be destroyed
[1:20:11] forever
[1:20:13] god could not destroy him in the
[1:20:15] original battle
[1:20:16] or god would have and we know it served
[1:20:18] god's greater purpose we understand that
[1:20:20] but there was something that bound god
[1:20:22] by his own law that he could not destroy
[1:20:24] him
[1:20:25] and it cast down and god is setting a
[1:20:27] trap
[1:20:29] he come down to this earth and he put
[1:20:32] man in a weak state
[1:20:33] amen and he put him down there
[1:20:35] susceptible to fall
[1:20:36] and he put him in a flesh like an animal
[1:20:39] amen and made him where he could fall
[1:20:41] that's what brother branham said
[1:20:42] and satan took advantage of this weak
[1:20:44] condition and in this week and this is
[1:20:46] satan's having victory
[1:20:47] and god is just setting a trap
[1:20:52] because haman's going to hang on his own
[1:20:53] gallows
[1:20:55] esther's going to the throne and haman's
[1:20:57] going to hang on his own gallows
[1:20:59] and here the devil has built a gallows
[1:21:01] amen he's built it up
[1:21:03] he's trying to preserve his position in
[1:21:04] heaven and his kingdom on earth
[1:21:08] but the the bride is going to kick him
[1:21:11] out of heaven
[1:21:14] by her life of belief on the word of god
[1:21:17] total faith in the word of god
[1:21:18] she's going to kick him out of heaven
[1:21:20] and she's going to take her place on the
[1:21:22] throne in the kingdom
[1:21:24] the heaven he's trying to preserve is
[1:21:25] for her and the earth he's trying to
[1:21:27] hold on to
[1:21:28] is for her
[1:21:32] hallelujah now you see why he fights you
[1:21:34] so hard
[1:21:35] one subject let down on one promise that
[1:21:37] he has victory over the word
[1:21:39] he's trying to hold it off hold it off
[1:21:41] keep my position in heaven
[1:21:43] amen keep my kingdom on earth but
[1:21:46] satan your kingdom's coming down
[1:21:50] your kingdom's coming down because
[1:21:52] there's a full word bringing full
[1:21:53] atonement in this day
[1:21:54] with a full life to make it live in me
[1:21:57] not
[1:21:58] my life his life living through me
[1:22:01] hallelujah
[1:22:04] for this purpose because the devil sent
[1:22:06] from the beginning for this purpose the
[1:22:07] son of god was manifested
[1:22:09] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:22:12] devil
[1:22:14] eve was deceived by the lust of the
[1:22:17] flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of
[1:22:18] life
[1:22:20] jesus went to the wilderness and was
[1:22:22] tempted by the lust of the flesh the
[1:22:23] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:22:26] and jesus overcame not with his mighty
[1:22:28] powers
[1:22:29] but he overcame by one thing it is
[1:22:32] written showing us how we can absolutely
[1:22:36] overcome
[1:22:36] the pride of life the lust of the eyes
[1:22:39] the lust of the flesh
[1:22:40] with it is written
[1:22:44] the word is our victory the word is our
[1:22:46] sword the word is our strong tower
[1:22:49] it's all in the word that's why the word
[1:22:51] was restored
[1:22:54] hallelujah partial word partial life
[1:22:58] full word full life who wants to read a
[1:23:01] message book now
[1:23:04] right brother said in the church age
[1:23:07] book
[1:23:07] he says you're you're you're only a
[1:23:10] strong
[1:23:11] spiritually healthy what else is it
[1:23:13] brother benjamin
[1:23:14] there's three you're only a strong
[1:23:17] spiritually healthy and something else
[1:23:19] as your knowledge of your word and your
[1:23:21] adherence to it
[1:23:25] so if you don't hear it and you don't
[1:23:26] adhere to it you're not strong and
[1:23:28] you're not spiritually healthy and
[1:23:29] you're not the third thing which is
[1:23:30] really good too
[1:23:33] but it's in the church age book see
[1:23:35] everything is
[1:23:36] based off hearing the word and adhering
[1:23:39] to it
[1:23:39] hearing the word and adhering to it but
[1:23:41] you've got to be hearing the word
[1:23:45] brother brahman said god god is trying
[1:23:47] to get this to you but you let so much
[1:23:49] take it out of you you let your jobs and
[1:23:51] you let your spouses and you let things
[1:23:53] of the world take it out of you god is
[1:23:54] trying to pump it into you
[1:23:57] and we're letting distractions of
[1:23:58] laodicean carnality
[1:24:00] take it out of us we've got to get
[1:24:01] ourselves separated
[1:24:03] god calls for total separation from
[1:24:06] all unbelief and this
[1:24:09] civilization is an unbelief civilization
[1:24:14] your phone your car your hospital it's
[1:24:16] all based on unbelief
[1:24:18] amen we've got to separate
[1:24:22] and come to the word hallelujah
[1:24:28] son of god was manifested he might
[1:24:30] destroy the works of the devil
[1:24:31] brother brother said in spoken word is
[1:24:33] the original seed christ was manifested
[1:24:35] to destroy
[1:24:36] the works of the devil he's just quoting
[1:24:39] first john 3
[1:24:39] 8. you believe that now i can't explain
[1:24:43] all this i'm just
[1:24:44] going to throw through it just quickly
[1:24:46] now hit the high places so you won't
[1:24:48] stay too long
[1:24:49] i said this before he's going to hit the
[1:24:51] high places won't stay too long this is
[1:24:52] a six hour sermon
[1:24:56] christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:24:57] works of the devil is that right
[1:25:00] you all believed that what was he god's
[1:25:02] word which destroys the works of the
[1:25:04] hybrid the devil
[1:25:05] is that right he was done to do that he
[1:25:08] was born to be that to destroy the works
[1:25:10] of the devil
[1:25:11] now his body is to do the same
[1:25:16] why because if he was word his body is
[1:25:20] word and the word of god is manifest to
[1:25:23] destroy the works of the devil
[1:25:24] not the word of god in here
[1:25:30] we've had this for hundreds and hundreds
[1:25:31] of years in print it's never destroyed
[1:25:33] the devil yet
[1:25:35] it's when the word is taken into a
[1:25:37] vessel and manifested out
[1:25:39] and that destroys the works of the devil
[1:25:41] jesus come by and he told his disciples
[1:25:43] i give you power over scorpions and over
[1:25:46] serpents and over every power of the
[1:25:48] devil
[1:25:49] amen that word meant nothing
[1:25:53] until somebody believed it and operated
[1:25:55] in it
[1:25:58] and when when peter goes down to the
[1:26:00] gate called beautiful
[1:26:01] and he said look on us gold and silver
[1:26:04] have i number such as i have give i unto
[1:26:06] thee
[1:26:07] what's he doing he's taking the word
[1:26:08] that jesus spoke
[1:26:10] now becomes manifest and the
[1:26:12] manifestation
[1:26:13] of the word destroys the works of the
[1:26:15] devil
[1:26:16] the devil the sin had put this man in
[1:26:19] this condition
[1:26:20] sin from hybridization sin from the
[1:26:22] garden had caused disease and disruption
[1:26:24] in mankind
[1:26:25] and caused this man he's sitting there
[1:26:27] afflicted of the attributes of sin
[1:26:31] that's the works of the devil
[1:26:34] christ was manifest to destroy the works
[1:26:36] of the devil
[1:26:37] and the body was done to do the same and
[1:26:40] jesus said i give you
[1:26:42] power but if peter would have never
[1:26:44] exercised that
[1:26:45] that would have just been words amen the
[1:26:47] words the words themself
[1:26:49] do not have the power to destroy the
[1:26:50] works of the devil
[1:26:53] it's the word made manifest that
[1:26:55] destroyed the works of the devil
[1:26:58] god had laid down prophecies in in
[1:27:00] genesis
[1:27:01] chapter 3 thy seed shall bruise the
[1:27:03] serpent's head amen
[1:27:04] that would have that that was laying
[1:27:06] there and laying there and laying there
[1:27:08] and until it was come manifest the
[1:27:10] serpent's head was not bruised
[1:27:13] so having the prophecy go forth yes it's
[1:27:15] a complete work yes it has to come to
[1:27:17] fulfillment
[1:27:18] but till the time of manifestation it
[1:27:20] doesn't express its full power
[1:27:23] and god has given promises in this day
[1:27:26] and we are not here to talk about the
[1:27:28] word
[1:27:28] we're not here to talk about the token
[1:27:30] we're not here to talk about the life
[1:27:31] but we are here to apply the token
[1:27:34] we are here to manifest the very life of
[1:27:36] jesus christ
[1:27:37] that's what we're here for and we have
[1:27:38] to expect it we have to know our place
[1:27:41] and we have to operate according to the
[1:27:42] word
[1:27:45] he was put here to destroy the works of
[1:27:47] the devil his body is to do the same
[1:27:50] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:27:51] revealed now christ the works that i do
[1:27:54] shall you do also see
[1:27:55] the same god the works that i do shall
[1:27:57] you do also more than this for i go into
[1:27:59] my father
[1:28:00] the church will be a little longer in
[1:28:02] light see
[1:28:04] vindicating his promised word
[1:28:08] he said the works that i do shall you do
[1:28:10] also
[1:28:12] more than this for i go into my father
[1:28:14] the church
[1:28:15] will be a little longer in the light
[1:28:18] what's she going to do while she's a
[1:28:19] little longer in the light
[1:28:22] vindicating his promised word that's our
[1:28:25] commission
[1:28:25] is to vindicate his promised promise as
[1:28:28] god did his promises in christ's body
[1:28:31] as god did his promises or fulfilled his
[1:28:33] promises in christ's body
[1:28:35] so is christ doing his same works
[1:28:38] in christ's body the church
[1:28:42] see now making his mystery known to his
[1:28:44] bride tree in the last day
[1:28:46] bringing forth the fruits that was in
[1:28:48] the tree at the beginning
[1:28:51] this church is here to be the light
[1:28:54] shining in the top of the tree bringing
[1:28:56] back the original fruits that was in the
[1:28:58] church
[1:29:01] last scripture romans 16.
[1:29:10] romans 16.
[1:29:16] verse 20.
[1:29:24] romans 16 verse 20 and the god of peace
[1:29:27] shall brew
[1:29:28] satan under your feet
[1:29:32] shortly
[1:29:36] i thought the promise was for the seed
[1:29:39] of the woman
[1:29:42] and and the serpent shall be bruised
[1:29:44] under this feet
[1:29:45] of the seed of the woman which we know
[1:29:47] is christ
[1:29:49] when christ came he was the seed of the
[1:29:51] woman and he came as jesus christ in
[1:29:53] that body of flesh
[1:29:54] and when he came in full measure in a
[1:29:57] body
[1:29:57] amen that was the fulfillment of that
[1:29:59] prophecy and he was supposed to bruise
[1:30:02] his head
[1:30:04] but here we get to paul talking to the
[1:30:06] church in romans
[1:30:07] and he is referring right back to that
[1:30:10] prophecy in genesis 3
[1:30:12] that refers to christ and he says and
[1:30:14] the god of peace shall brew satan under
[1:30:16] not jesus christ's feet
[1:30:21] under your feet shortly
[1:30:25] why because there's two masterpieces
[1:30:28] going together to make the masterpiece
[1:30:30] family
[1:30:30] the male expression and the female
[1:30:32] expression the head
[1:30:34] and the body and the head has united
[1:30:36] with the body
[1:30:37] and now this has become the full
[1:30:39] manifestation
[1:30:40] of christ the seed of the woman on full
[1:30:43] display
[1:30:44] in our day to brew satan under your
[1:30:48] feet friends he is not coming down from
[1:30:51] heaven until you're in position
[1:30:53] he's not coming down to all unbelief is
[1:30:56] out of the church of god
[1:30:57] and she's operating in the full power of
[1:30:59] jesus christ and gone
[1:31:00] back to what she fell from in pentecost
[1:31:05] as long as we're not doing what god
[1:31:06] calls us do we're paralyzing the work of
[1:31:09] god
[1:31:12] you know why when when moses came to
[1:31:14] deliver the children of israel
[1:31:16] he came but the children of israel
[1:31:17] weren't ready for deliverance yet
[1:31:19] and he came and they said what are you a
[1:31:21] ruler over us and he runs out into the
[1:31:23] wilderness for 40 years
[1:31:26] over 40 years and while he's out there
[1:31:28] what's happening
[1:31:29] something's changing because they didn't
[1:31:31] want him when he first came
[1:31:32] but now after this long delay all of a
[1:31:35] sudden conditions have changed in egypt
[1:31:37] things have gotten worse in the world
[1:31:39] and now all of a sudden
[1:31:40] god comes down to moses and said i'm
[1:31:42] come down to deliver
[1:31:44] my people for i have heard the cries
[1:31:47] of my people they weren't crying for
[1:31:49] deliverance when moses were there
[1:31:51] they were comfortable but the the
[1:31:53] condition in egypt changed and when the
[1:31:58] condition of egypt changed
[1:32:00] now the people started crying for
[1:32:02] deliverance
[1:32:04] and god heard their cry and now it was
[1:32:06] time for deliverance
[1:32:07] the prophet came and brought us the word
[1:32:09] and he fully expected the church to
[1:32:11] rapture
[1:32:13] you listen to what he said he fully
[1:32:14] expected that church to go
[1:32:18] but have we come to the time where egypt
[1:32:20] has changed
[1:32:21] the world has changed over 50 some years
[1:32:24] now
[1:32:24] we've come to the place are the people
[1:32:26] now crying out for deliverance
[1:32:29] are we now are we now ready for what was
[1:32:32] brought to us the first time
[1:32:33] are we now ready to take the word that
[1:32:35] was delivered to us 52 years ago
[1:32:37] are we ready now are we crying out say
[1:32:40] oh god would you bring it now
[1:32:42] now i'm ready for deliverance i want
[1:32:44] that word now i want that manifestation
[1:32:46] now
[1:32:46] i'm ready to sacrifice all my ideas i'm
[1:32:49] ready to give up
[1:32:50] all my life i'm crying out for
[1:32:52] deliverance
[1:32:55] if you want something from god cry out
[1:32:57] for it
[1:32:58] desperation always brings god on the
[1:33:00] scene and it is time for this church to
[1:33:03] cry out for deliverance
[1:33:04] saying oh god we have been in this land
[1:33:07] we're in bondage in this land but you've
[1:33:09] promised us redemption and freedom
[1:33:11] to go back to our promised land
[1:33:15] amen there's a promise in the word
[1:33:18] the god of peace shall bruise satan
[1:33:23] i used to read this scripture i thought
[1:33:24] well that's neat
[1:33:26] satan's going to be bruised you know
[1:33:29] i'm thinking of bruce like oh oh oh i
[1:33:32] got a bruise
[1:33:35] let's see what this word means in the
[1:33:38] greek
[1:33:40] bruise is suntribo in the greek
[1:33:45] it means to break in pieces
[1:33:51] to shiver to tread down
[1:33:54] to trample on to break down to crush
[1:33:57] to tear one's body and shatter one's
[1:34:02] strength
[1:34:05] and god and god
[1:34:12] of the god of peace shall
[1:34:17] tear satan's body and shatter his
[1:34:21] strength
[1:34:22] and tear to pieces into shivers satan
[1:34:25] under your feet shortly
[1:34:29] he's not only going to lose his position
[1:34:30] in heaven he's going to lose his earthly
[1:34:32] kingdom
[1:34:33] haman's losing it all haman had worked a
[1:34:36] plan
[1:34:37] to where he was going to get it all he
[1:34:38] got the king's ring he got the king's
[1:34:41] friendship he's going to destroy his
[1:34:43] enemies he's going to be secure in the
[1:34:44] kingdom
[1:34:45] but there was an esther that came on the
[1:34:47] scene and when esther came on the scene
[1:34:49] she disrupted the entire works of haman
[1:34:52] and haman ended up hanging
[1:34:54] in his own gallows and satan has been
[1:34:57] trying to get keep
[1:34:58] keep the inheritance from the children
[1:35:00] of god and he's worked a plan
[1:35:02] and he's got certain rights because
[1:35:03] because of the fall and he's been the
[1:35:05] accuser of the brethren and he set up
[1:35:07] his kingdom on earth and he's a squatter
[1:35:09] bringing satan's eden he's got it all
[1:35:11] mapped out he's got his plan
[1:35:12] he's so close to having it all secure
[1:35:15] but there's going to be an esther that's
[1:35:17] going to disrupt the whole works
[1:35:18] and esther is going to see to it that
[1:35:20] haman hangs
[1:35:21] on his own galleries
[1:35:24] the god of peace shall break into
[1:35:27] shivers and tread down
[1:35:29] to break the body and destroy the
[1:35:32] strength
[1:35:32] of satan under your feet sure
[1:35:37] let's all stand musicians if you could
[1:35:39] come
[1:35:40] hallelujah amen
[1:35:44] [Applause]

[1:36:22] enemy and i i have to take the word
[1:36:26] and i have to receive the word and i
[1:36:28] have to submit myself to the spirit
[1:36:30] and let it flow through me so that we
[1:36:32] can all have victory
[1:36:35] as long as he as long as one
[1:36:38] subject lets down the bar on the word
[1:36:40] satan has victory over the word of god
[1:36:42] but he salt to it to predestinated a
[1:36:44] bride
[1:36:45] and he sent a word and he sent a life
[1:36:47] with that word that is going to assure
[1:36:49] that she does not fall

[1:36:55] let's pray dear heavenly father we thank
[1:36:57] you for your word
[1:36:59] god you have been so wonderful to us
[1:37:02] lord
[1:37:03] many prophets and mighty men lord would
[1:37:05] have loved to see this
[1:37:06] day but we're just humble people lord
[1:37:09] we're
[1:37:09] farmers and mechanics and housewives and
[1:37:12] all kinds of different jobs that we have
[1:37:14] and
[1:37:15] we're old and young and middle-aged and
[1:37:17] bald-headed and gray-headed and
[1:37:19] everything under the sun
[1:37:20] and lord we're nothing special in the
[1:37:22] eyes of the world but we are a
[1:37:24] predestinated people lord
[1:37:26] and you're by the opening of the seals
[1:37:28] you're breaking the crust off of our
[1:37:30] eyes lord you're bringing us to a fresh
[1:37:32] revelation of your word to waken us from
[1:37:34] spiritual amnesia
[1:37:36] to take our place in this invincible
[1:37:38] army so that our enemy can be completely
[1:37:41] and utterly destroyed oh god forgive us
[1:37:44] for our compromise forgive us for our
[1:37:46] laziness lord strip us away from those
[1:37:49] things and bring us lord to your word
[1:37:52] let us have your word and only your word
[1:37:54] grant us
[1:37:55] faith lord quicken faith unto us that we
[1:37:57] might believe
[1:37:58] give us greater revelation open our eyes
[1:38:00] like never before to see
[1:38:02] your word oh god we love you we ask that
[1:38:04] you have your way with your people we
[1:38:06] yield ourselves to you
[1:38:08] we give ourselves to you in jesus
[1:38:10] christ's name
[1:38:11] amen god bless you saints
[1:38:16] i remember a story brother ram tells of
[1:38:19] the eagle going through its molting
[1:38:20] period
[1:38:22] he calls it the moping period sometimes
[1:38:25] and he gets down and he gets a crust
[1:38:27] that comes over his face and comes over
[1:38:29] his eyes
[1:38:31] there's only one way that he can restore
[1:38:34] his strength and go to the heavenlies
[1:38:37] he's got to get this crust off of his
[1:38:39] head and off of his eyes
[1:38:42] somehow somehow many
[1:38:46] who've been trusting the lord eagles not
[1:38:49] sinners eagles somehow get this crust of
[1:38:53] the world built over our eyes
[1:38:56] amen john the baptist brother bram said
[1:38:59] his eagle eye
[1:39:00] filmed over he got into a place amen
[1:39:03] he was in a condition in bondage and
[1:39:06] separated from the life of jesus christ
[1:39:08] not able to be associated there he got
[1:39:10] into a position where
[1:39:12] he had a film that came over his eyes
[1:39:15] and many times it can happen to your eye
[1:39:17] that that spiritual amnesia can begin to
[1:39:19] creep back in and we start to identify
[1:39:21] more with the world than with the word
[1:39:24] and crust but there was only one way for
[1:39:26] that eagle to get that crust
[1:39:29] he had to beat his head on the rock of
[1:39:32] revelation
[1:39:33] of jesus christ beat out all his old
[1:39:37] thinking
[1:39:38] beat out all his own stubbornness beat
[1:39:40] out all his own ignorance
[1:39:41] and he had himself to beat his head on
[1:39:44] the rock
[1:39:45] of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:39:49] how many of you need here today to beat
[1:39:51] your head on the rock of the revelation
[1:39:53] of jesus
[1:39:54] christ and say god give me fresh vision
[1:39:56] beat this crust of the world off of my
[1:39:58] eyes
[1:39:59] break spiritual amnesia for me let me
[1:40:01] see you lord
[1:40:03] oh god break the crust from off of our
[1:40:06] eyes
[1:40:06] friends you've got to beat your head on
[1:40:09] the rock of the revelation of jesus
[1:40:11] christ
[1:40:13] and all the scales will come off and
[1:40:16] you'll renew your strength
[1:40:18] and as eagles mount up with wings and
[1:40:20] fly
