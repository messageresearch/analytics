TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all of a sudden Jesus taught him a very valuable lesson you're worried about a man defiling himself by eating with unwashed hands it's not the eating with what not what goes into a man that defiles him it's what comes out of his heart that defiles him it's the condition of the heart being expressed as what's defiling the man not what he's putting in but what's coming out amen so God Christ is showing them that what you need is a change in your heart amen not all of these ordinances to try to keep everything outside from coming inside you need the thing that really defiles a man is the wickedness inside coming outside that's what defiles him amen this is the fallacy of the Holiness movement this is the fallacy of any legalistic movement the Pharisee movement the Holiness movement the the fallacy is that we can weaken through conduct and Order keep any evil from coming in and defiling ourselves we dress right talk right go to church do all these things and and we don't watch anything and we don't we don't listen any bad thing we don't do any bad thing we won't let any bad thing come in the problem is the thing that's defiling you is unregenerate hearts the thing that's defiling you is not being born again the thing that is corrupting you is that which is coming out of you amen you need the word to come in and be a sanctifying process and the Holy Ghost to come in and burn out all of that and bring you into the position the word has for you amen that's why putting on will never work that's why doing will never work amen it's got to be his doing our surrender to his doing that'll come in and bring a change on the inside because the corruption that is in man is in the heart of man so I rule keeping won't do it but I tell you one thing if the Holy Fire of God has burned out the old nature and burn out the old men and the seed of God has sprung the line amen and you become Holiness unto the Lord it'll change the way you dress it'll change the way you talk it'll change your attitudes and that which starts coming out of you will not be what defiles you but what comes out of you will be the very life of God will be coming out of your mouth amen when your kindness and your sweetness and your temperament change and all of these things that are taking place is because we've come surrendered to the word and it washed us and he purified us and he burned us and he changed us and then when we become Holiness unto the Lord we will dress holy talk holy walk holy think holy feel holy you understand that's the Holiness we need
