the desire of our heart i pray that you'd bring it to pass in our lives lord as we surrender to you now under the under the breaking of the bread of the coming forth of your word i pray that we would

day by day lord we pray that you take your place in this service lord as we give you the headship may you come lord as the great shepherd of the flock and feed us by your own hand may we go out of here lord satisfied with the portion you've given us maybe go rejoicing lord at the at the bread of life that you've given to us we ask that you'd bless us now as we take this bible and open it and begin to read it lord may it be more than an exercise of literacy but be it may it be by supernatural revelation and by a gift lord that you've placed in a body to preach the word and lord may it take effect and fulfill the purpose that you've designed for this hour for this day that we live in have your way amongst us we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you all let's take our bibles while we are still standing and turn to revelation chapter 5. amen revelation chapter 5 and we'll read two verses of scripture verse 4 and verse 5. continuing on the same vein of thought because i can't get any other vein amen it's just god just has us meditating in this same area and so we thank god for that we're just going to keep going as long as the lord leads and and so for a title i just titled this he prevailed she will prevail he prevailed she will prevail let's look at this scripture in chapter 5 verse 4 and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof amen you can have your seats so we see that the the line of the tribe of the judah the root of david hath prevailed and he hath prevailed to open the book and brother branham makes a statement in the breach he says and john started crying because no one was worthy and no one could even look at the book oh it took a human being john webb because no one could do it and everything was lost and there came a voice from one of the elders standing in the midst of the four beasts and all the great host of heaven said don't weep john oh my the grace of god don't be broken-hearted john don't weep for the lion of the tribe of judah the root and offspring of david he has prevailed prevail means to wrestle with and overcome oh my so i want to talk about that as well brother branham says he prevailed and brother gives us the definition of prevail means to wrestle with and overcome and he says in the garden of gethsemane when his blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming amen the lion the root and the root of david has prevailed hath has overcome and so now we want to look at this prevail he prevailed it means he wrestled with and he overcome and when brother bam gives us that definition he goes right to the garden of gethsemane and then he says in the garden of gethsemane when his blood dropped down his face he was overcoming and showing that he was overcoming in gethsemane and he had to wrestle with and overcome and the question is what was he wrestling with in gethsemane i mean he was he was overcoming amen he had to prevail he had to prevail amen so that he could take this book and he had to prevail amen for the process of redemption amen to come into fruition he had to prevail but in order to prevail before he went to calvary first he had to go to gethsemane and when he go to gethsemane he had a wrestling match in gethsemane and the wrestling match in gethsemane was with his own will amen we can pick that up in the scriptures let's go to matthew 26 so we can see this together matthew chapter 26 and we'll look at verse 36 matthew 26 and we'll start at verse 36 then cometh jesus with them into a place called gethsemane and saith unto disciples set ye here while i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then say at the end of them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye hear and watch with me so he begins to express to these three that he has to come along with him he begins to express to them his great sorrow and he says in my soul he's using the extreme language my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death amen so now he's feeling the full brunt amen he's feeling the full uh weight he's in gethsemane amen and jesus when he went to fulfill the word when jesus was you know jesus was born the lamb of god amen he was the word made flesh he was the fullness of the word and made flesh and he was the body that god built to dwell in he was all of this amen when it came time for the word the very purpose of his birth to come to fruition and it came time for the very manifestation of the thing that he was born as the lamb of god to be the sacrifice to take away the sins of the world when he comes to it he's got to pass through gethsemane in order to keep the word and in passing through gethsemane he feels the full brunt of it amen he was the word made flesh amen he was the body that god chose to dwell in he was the son of god but he wasn't skipping through gethsemane to go amen i've got a promise in my life and i'm going to fulfill this promise in my life and praise the lord isn't this wonderful i'm the chosen vessel i'm the chosen one and the and the word is going to be made manifest in me and and i'm going to uh there's going to be redemption because of me but when he gets down to it amen he's he's exceedingly sorrowful unto death it's good friends because he laid a pattern for us he laid a pattern down for us and he and he now begins to say he's exceedingly sorrowful even unto death terry you hear and watch with me this full this full effect of the word coming to the hour of the manifestation of the word this full effect that it's having on him as a human being amen does not diminish the fulfillment of the prophecy does not diminish the words that have been spoken of him and the prophecies all down through the old testament none of that's diminished but he still has to pass through it he still feels it he still has to go through the process of surrendering to the father verse 39 and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou will so here this is expressing his wrestling match and we've talked about this this isn't the first time we've talked about this but he's expressing it he's asking father if it's possible let this cup pass from me jesus would like to bypass suffering he would like to bypass the thing that he's moving into and he's asking the lord if there's any other way he's asking the lord lord if it's possible he's sorrowful unto death exceedingly sorrowful unto death amen he's praying earnestly to his father and he's asking his father is there any other way is it possible for this cup to pass from me if it's possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt this is the wrestling match this is what he's wrestling with not my will your will brother branham said in gethsemane he was prevailing amen wrestling with and overcoming wrestling with his own free moral agency is that true we're going to read several quotes for brother ben tells us that wrestling with his own free choice wrestling with his own will and he had to go through the process of laying down his life laying down his will the father follow the word for his season the word for his age he had to lay down his life amen to follow the father's will he had to surrender his own will to follow the father's will and that whole process listen this this wasn't just he wasn't just acting this out amen he was experiencing it he was living it he was fleshing it out it wasn't just a trivial thing like i said before this wasn't light this wasn't just a passing fleeting thing and i'm just going to act this little part out he was living it friends he was going through it he was suffering through it enduring through it and he was surrendering under it and i pray that god will help me express this the way the lord's been revealing it to me so that we understand it had to be this way amen it could be no other way this is the way it had to be verse 40 says and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and say unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour look at the disappointment of the lord he is so he is so afflicted he is so weighted down he is so sorrowful he is in such a wrestling match he's looking for somebody just to watch with him and pray with him and help me have you ever been there i just if it comes to peter now listen the lord is suffering tremendously and he comes to peter one of his closest confidence and one of his closest disciples and he finds him asleep and you can see you can hear the disappointment in his voice when he asked peter could you not watch with me one hour i'm dying and you don't understand because like i said this is laying an example for us all because there's times that we have to come to surrender to the word and there's nobody else that can walk that path with you when it come time for jacob to wrestle with the angel amen he had to go alone when he got all by himself that's when the angel appeared to him so he had something to wrestle with and latch a hold of he was prevailing amen because he wrestled with and he overcame but he had to do it alone his wives couldn't go with him his servants couldn't go with him nobody could go with him and here jesus he even wants to bring three of his disciples amen to watch with him and to pray with him and to support him in his hour amen and they're falling asleep they can't even stay awake and the lord is disappointed he's asking the question could you not even watch with me one hour this is something he's going to have to do alone then he says in verse 41 watch and pray that you enter not into the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak and he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done he already said that once now he's going through it again and he came and he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy now listen i i hope that the bible becomes real to us i hope that under this message the prophet of god made this bible real amen it's not a fairy tale it's not a story you have to imagine jesus he's going off by himself he's so heavy he's so sorrowful that they could tell after the last supper they could tell his countenance was down that he was under a heavy load amen he goes to the garden and he says you all wait here and he brings three of his closest companions three of his best friends on earth three of the individuals that was closer to him than anybody else and he goes away separate with them and says watch with me my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death watch with me and he goes and he prays to god amen and he pours out his heart to god and said god can this cup pass from me but not my will yours and he comes back to them why does he come back to them why doesn't he keep praying to god amen this is just my personal opinion but under that heavy burden he's looking for comfort he comes to them he says couldn't you wait with me one hour pray pray that you don't enter into temptation then he goes and he repeats a part of what he just said to god god if this cup if this cup cannot pass from me amen if it be your will then let it be your will not mine and that he goes back to his friends again just look at this friends look at this and live through it with the lord he comes back again and he finds them asleep he is all alone in the world amen and he's the weight of what has to happen the weight of the fulfillment of the word is right upon him and he's wrestling here in gethsemane and nobody can wrestle with him comes the second time finds them asleep goes back verse 44 and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples so the third time he said the same thing he said the second time but why is he keep repeating the same thing think about it think about it why is he going back again because he is under such a burden he would love if god would say you don't have to do that he would love if the father would change the word for him if you've never been there i promise you at some point in your life you're going to get there where you would love for god to alter the word for you that you're going to have to make a stand or make a decision on the word that is going to grieve you or cost you there's going to be some price to pay to stay with the word and if you've not come there yet you're probably going to come there before you get out of here and nobody can go there with you but you're going to have to surrender and i'm telling you when you get to that time i would imagine that you're going to keep checking with god god are you sure this is the only way are you sure there's no other way and you you may try to talk to friends and get them to pray with you you may call a bunch of people and say will you pray with me but they can never bear this burden with you there's a burden of the fulfillment of the word in your life that you're the only one that can bear that burden you're going to come face to face with the word and you're listen you're going to ask the lord is there any other way you know we talk about being the bride and fulfilling the word and there's a blessing that goes with it amen but it's it can almost sometimes be like a pep rally like a a cheerleader type thing we're going to keep the word we're not going to fail in the word but when jesus kept the word and when he didn't fail by the word it wasn't a pep rally it was a groaning under under the spirit it was a wrestling with his own will it was a being exceedingly sorrowful unto death when he come to time to fulfill what he was born for when he come to the moment where all the prophecies in his life were going to come to be fulfilled he was the chosen vessel he was the one redemption was resting on his shoulders he didn't skip to it friends he had to die he had to die to his will he had to die to himself he had to die to his loves he had to die to his preferences and we wonder sometimes why it's so hard it was hard for the lord and he comes again father if this cup can't pass by me unless i drink of it thy will not mine listen you would think you would think that the only begotten son of god could just say lord if this is what you want that's good enough for me i'm fine let's go okay i'm ready for calvary that's sometimes how we act like we can do this we got this there's a prophecy in my life watch out devil here i come but when jesus come to the fulfillment of the word it was going to cost him everything he knew what price he was going to pay and as he was wrestling with his own will he was he was prevailing in gethsemane i don't mean to preach heavy i i want to i want to have a pep rally every service and let's walk out of here we're going to get him go fight go lions eagles charge but this is the example we have this is the reality of the word when brother branham come to terms with who he was it didn't cause him skipping through the garden it was a heaviness there was a burden that come with carrying the word there was a burden that came with bringing the seals when he said this will cost 10 000 of my friends to leave me he suffered rejection he suffered terribly and even when he tried to exert his own will to get away from the pressure and away from the rejection he was going to go up into alaska and deceive his wife and and and god began to rebuke him and all he was trying to do was get away from the pressure and get away from the grief he said i'm all cut up on the inside from fighting a lot of hard battles what was he a chosen vessel predestinated to be elijah but what kind of prevailing did that prophet have to go through what kind of wrestling did he have to wrestle with to bring forth the word and manifest the word in his life what kind of stand did he have to take what kind of rejection did he have to face what what about all his friends could you watch with me pray with me he's the only one that can make this kind of surrender he says verse 44 again and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hours at hand the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners i think 45 is when we see him overcome look at verse 45 sleep on now take your rest i've settled into my own heart he's not asking them to pray he's not rebuking them for not staying up with him he's not going back and forth to god anymore he's not asking a fourth time a fifth time i believe personally this is brother chad that verse 45 shows where he prevailed sleep on it's okay i'm not asking you to pray anymore i've already settled it in my hearts i chose this path and i'm walking it of my own choosing now he wasn't looking to anybody else to help him he wasn't looking to change god's mind he wasn't checking in with him again to see if maybe he had changed since the last time he wasn't in this turmoil he wasn't in this point of decision now listen when you come to the decisions like these kind of decisions amen it'll absolutely wreck your life tear your stomach up your heart will be bleeding within your stomach will be churning your nerves will be tense you're coming to make this decision but once you submit to the will of god and surrender there's a peace that always comes knowing you'll face rejection knowing that that people will misunderstand your choice knowing that they won't understand they won't comprehend knowing all of that there's something that comes over amen the desperate wrestling is over now it's time to just go do what i've surrendered myself to do like i said if you have an experience that you will i don't think anybody gets to bypass this brother brahms said and the message show us the father and it will satisfy us in 1959. he said you believe god's in his son god's in his universe god's in his word god is in his son now is god in his people the death of christ was to sanctify a church that he might work through and continue his work there had to be an atonement made in his body the man jesus was made a sacrifice willingly like we take take it through this last week in a type of isaac willingly submitted himself to death he didn't have to die he said no man takes my life i lay it down let's look at that in john chapter 10 together let's turn to john chapter 10 quickly john chapter 10 verse 17. therefore doth does my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again he's saying this has even caused for my father to love me like you can say he'll love me at all costs but jesus was saying therefore does my father love me because i laid down my life that i might take it again no man takes it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father jesus knew this before gethsemane jesus also knew that if you destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up he knew that before it gets so many he also knew that the chief elders and chief priests would take him and evenly mistreat him and kill him before gethsemane he knew the prophecies he knew the word he was the word he knew it all but when it came down to it he had to die and wrestle in gethsemane to take that will of his and submit it to the will of the father but he said therefore that the father loving me because i laid down my life for the sheep brother bam said in conference 1961 let's get to one another it's called the gethsemane conference there was a terrible conference he didn't have to die a young man he didn't have to do it but when he seen lost humanity his condition said not my will but thine be done brother benham is clear on this that jesus didn't have to die meaning that he was not sin born he was not born like you and i he didn't have to die and he was not forced to die you say but the word says according to the word he had to die but he was never forced to surrender his life he had to do that of his own choosing 1962 forsaking all what else did jesus do he gave and forsook his own life he gave his life to save yours and mine because that's he gave his life he didn't have to lay it down he done it willingly he didn't have to do it but he'd done it willingly because he he could so he could save you in the fifth seal 1963 he says there couldn't have been a mortal being suffer like that until his own grief separated his water from his blood and his veins before he went to calvary drops of blood was coming from his body with such grief and broken heart and what he had to do but could have refused it this is in the fifth seal but could have refused it to but willingly did it for you and i see jesus could have run away he knew judas was betraying him he said so at the last supper he told judas to go do what he must do do it quickly he said the son of man will be betrayed by by one of his fellows he knew it was coming amen he could have run away and hid amen but he was wrestling now in gethsemane he was staying put he was asking god he was laying right there and saying oh god oh god oh god going to his friends coming back to god until finally he said rest it's okay the son of man is betrayed but i want to make this clear where brother ben said he didn't have to die he could have refused it meaning jesus christ was put on free moral agency because the first adam was put on free moral agency and the first adam in the garden was not willing to do what jesus was willing to do in the garden of gethsemane and he exerted his own will and took back his wife and we know it all plays in amen to god's great drama amen but free moral agency caused the first fall in the garden of eden caused everything to be lost so now god is going to use the exact same mechanism in the last adam to start bringing back redemption and it had to be by free moral agency it could not be by force but it had to be by free moral agency so jesus was not forced to calvary this is this is this gets really important so i want you to pay close attention he was not forced to calvary but he did so willingly he was not forced he he gave of his own life he chose he surrendered to god because that was the only way that he could bring back redemption to reverse what was done in the garden of eden is now he was going to have to exercise his own free moral agency god was not forcing him god was not making him amen but he laid down his life for the sheep that's an important principle so hold on to that we'll get more to more of that in a minute but let's go to first john first john chapter 3. first john 3 and 16 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren so he's saying what he did we should do brother benham the message leadership he said each one of us has to make a choice and it's confronting to us that we're all confronted with this one thing what are we going to do about eternal life we're going to live here after or not then we have to come to jesus to get that the opportunity of choosing that's one thing god gave us he don't force something on us he just lets us make our own choice so you have to you have to not be forced but just make your own choice this is such an important principle that we have to get down to terms of the with this because jesus when he come down to it he had to make his own choice you and i when we come down to it to make his own choice and i believe that i'm just as predestinated as he was and i believe there's prophecy speaking of me overcoming an end time just like there was prophecies of him overcoming in the end time and i believe i'm part of the word the same as he's part of the word but that doesn't mean that that that it's going to be different for me than it was for him he had to lay down his own life and make his own choice and now we're being asked to surrender our own will and lay down our own life to take the father's will and god's not going to force us into it and there's so many times that we are thinking and asking and expecting god to do everything we are acting as if well you know i'm predestinating not to fall i can't fall when i'm telling your friends that you can fall daily amen there's a prophecy that the elect of god will not fall ultimately you understand that we'll not fall ultimately the pre these predestinated not to but you take that attitude and i'm sure that you're going to experience a fall in a correction because god he's he's not going to force you so we we would love it if god would rearrange all the obstacles we never have to make a hard choice and never have a separation over the word amen never have to have be rejected because of our choice of the word we would absolutely love that we would say god let me bypass this make it to where i don't have to say anything make it to where i don't have to make a choice oh god can you rearrange it all and he's not touching anything amen because he's asking you to make your choice on the word amen and we keep going back to him will you rearrange it will you change is there any other way and he doesn't do anything and we say oh god you know if you'll just come down and anoint me to do it well i want to tell you something the anointing left jesus when it was time to do it when god let jesus make his choice and march to calvary he removed the anointing amen so he would have to go of his own choosing and when we go to make touches oh god just do it just just speak and he's saying you speak you've got the word what's your choice i've just i would like to say this i don't think being the bride will be as easy as most people thought it would be i don't think the bride that'll have victory over death of the end time that'll see the fullness of redemption come in the change of her atoms i do not believe it will be as easy as we expected and i do not believe it will be as easy as we've acted like i do not believe it will happen without our gethsemanes in 1965 who is this melchizedek brother says notice after the battle was over melchizedek served his victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here in time in the view of communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of christ and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out what are you struggling with you're struggling with your nature you're struggling with your will you're struggling with your own thinking you're struggling with what jesus struggled with in gethsemane you're struggling but after you've struggled and you've battled it out and you've got yourself all whipped out they become part of his being you get it jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him that's right battled for life and after the battle is over then god gives you of himself that is the true communion the little bread and wafer just represents it you shouldn't take it unless you've wrestled it out and become part of god brotherhood was telling us that melchizedek when melchizedek come on the scene to serve bread and wine he did it after abraham had battled it out after the battle was over and brother man types that right back he said after you've wrestled it out after you've battled it out and got yourself all whipped out and become part of his being then he gives you of himself and we we want god to do everything and god has already done everything well we want god he but he's already done everything he's already provided a lamb that blood has already been spilled he's already given his word he's already promised to be with you and to the end of the world he has already given everything now it's our turn to give of ourselves let's go to first corinthians chapter 9. first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate has self-control temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we unincorruptable now is paul in this race talking about what god's supposed to be doing or he's talking about his part he's got self-control he's temperate in all things he's running to obtain a prize he's taking control of himself they do it for a corruptable but we for an incorruptable then he says in verse 26 i therefore so run not as uncertain shall fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a cast away paul was not asking god to bring his flesh into subjection to the word paul was saying i do that is that what paul said i'm not adding words to am i or am i just reading what he said and when he says i keep under my body if you look that up in the concordance it says to beat black and blue to afflict too weary that's what the concordance just look up strong corners it's what it says keep under my body and and bring it listen and bring it into subjection that subjection means bring it into slavery i take this body that's corruptible that's trying to sleep me the wrong way and i weary it i wear it out i beat it black and blue and bring it into slavery amen so that it obey the word of god paul was not paul was not asking the lord to do that he was telling us what he did and telling us what we should do in perfect strength by perfect weakness brother man says i've often said the greatest enemy i got is william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves god right out of the picture but when i can get rid of that guy when i get to a place that he's out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about what was william branham wrestling with his own flesh his own self amen bringing it into subjection subduing it bringing in the bondage and the slavery and wearing it beating it black and blue blue and when he can get it out of the way and surrender to god god can do things that that man can never do that's when god can use you that's when he can use any of you you can you can he can use anybody when we get out of the way now brother-in-law says it makes an interesting quote here in satan's eden and i want to spend a few minutes on this he says after the millennium's over then they'll be established eden again god's great kingdom will be taken back because jesus fought it out with satan in the garden of gethsemane and won back eden listen what the prophet said when he battled it out with satan in the garden of gethsemane amen how did he battle that with satan amen there was no man there with a fork stick and and and and uh horns on his head amen what he was doing is there was a temptation coming to him amen to exert his own will to run away from this plan of god and he was surrendering himself to god and when he was battling it out he was battling it out with satan when he battled it out and surrendered himself in gethsemane when he wrestled and overcame in gethsemane brother branham says he won back eden so he won back eden when he surrendered his will to the will of god amen he gave a full surrender willingly not by force not what god did what he did and when he surrendered willingly and gave up his will he won back eden how was eden lost eden lost when the temptation of the devil caused man to exert his own will over the will of god how was eden won eden was one when a man would subdue his own will and come subject to the will of god so the way it was lost is the way it was won you see the way god keeps everything in equity and see the way god works amen if free moral agency was a powerful agent to throw the whole world into chaos and cause man to lose its inheritance then it has to be a powerful enough agent to win it all back does that make sense if it was powerful enough to cause to fall then it must be powerful enough to bring redemption and god had never yet had a man on the earth that would fully surrender his whole will to god amen everyone that was tried at some point failed david found moses failed every one of them failed at some point but he finally comes to a man amen who completely rings out and surrenders everything and in gethsemane he wins back eden he wins back to right and then at calvary he pays the price to purchase it he won it back before he paid for it amen he won it back in eden what was happening the last adam was now battling it out in his hour of temptation he was facing the tame same temptation that every son of god has faced from the time of adam on amen will you fully surrender to the will of god or will you take your own will even in one matter and there was a son of god on the earth this time that was not sin born amen that was not going to go the same way he was predestinated not to and because he was predestinated not to there was an ability there but he had to exercise his own will his own free moral agency and when he did that he won back what the first adam lost then he laid down his life and went to calvary to pay the price for what he had already won see the thought that i've been dwelling on the meditation that's been in my heart is the power of free choice brother bram talks about this as free moral agency or free choice he speaks about it through the entire message and he shows that man was put on free moral agency and and it really it really goes back further than that because lucifer and the angels had a choice and lucifer the angels made their choice so free choice free moral agency free choice caused the fallen heaven the disruption of heaven then free choice caused the disruption of earth amen of eden so my question is if free choice caused the fall what will he use for redemption what power is there in free choice and brother branham said god set it up this way this is god's setup he said it this way for a reason and brother behind said in god's only provided place of worship he said he had in his heart before the foundation of the world a son because he's a father but it was still in the genes of his word and he created a man and he had to put him on free moral agency but that man fell but the great sculptor god who made man from the dust of the earth he didn't settle for that he started making man again and he made noah he died drunk he made moses that failed to keep his word he made profits that run in the time of trouble and he kept building and molding until after a while he wanted a masterpiece to reflect him his nature what was in his heart what a son should be so god had a in his heart what a son should be amen and the first son adam failed to manifest what was in god's heart for a son to be but this one that he made when he rebuilt the masterpiece and he rebuilt it all the way back till he comes to jesus christ himself and he was reflecting in him what god had in his heart what he wanted a son to be totally submissive completely uh completely given over to the will of the father completely surrendering his own life to fulfill the will of the father that was the idea of what god wanted in the son and he was going to use that son to redeem what had been lost and satan's eaten again brother bram says satan has succeeded in perverting and taking over this world and making his kingdom that man was put on by free moral agency to choose for themselves what kind of life they desired and that shows what's in your heart your choice you know what your actions speak so loud it drowns out your voice brother branham said that that free moral agency god set it up on free moral agency that man could choose for themselves and that shows what's in your heart so god has this mechanism of free choice and free choice has a huge power associated with it you know all the time we're talking about power power power and the truth power for this power for that power i'm telling you the greatest power that has been given to you is the power to choose the word i can't think of a greater power amen jesus had all kinds of powers but in order to come to redemption he didn't use any of his powers to come through redemption what he did is he used the power of free choice to give up his will and choose the father's will and when he exercised that power of free choice that power of free choice paid the price of redemption for you and i to ultimately reverse the curse that was put upon us when the first adam made his free choice so we you know if you want to talk about power let's get down to real power you know so we we we go so often crazy directions and and talk about things that are just foolish just to make ourselves feel good we've got power we're this and we're that we're that when god gave him the holy ghost he gave him power by the holy ghost to be his witnesses and there's a power that he's given with free choice and that free choice has a power to determine your eternal destination now he did this and he set it up because your choice shows what's in your heart and now this free moral agency it'll begin it'll begin to restore man back to god because my free choice to express there's a son of god there's the son of god there's the son of god because the choice they makes begins to reflect what's on the inside of them when they choose the word and surrender themselves and choose the word and surrender themselves it begins to reflect what's actually on the inside they're not in this life just to gain we're not here just to fulfill our own purpose we're not here just to have a pleasurable life and have it easy and everything easy but when you begin to express what's on the inside by coming to obstacles and taking the word amen by coming to rejection and taking the word as you keep taking the word you're reflecting what's on the inside demonstrating your children of god let's go to genesis chapter 3. genesis chapter 3 verse 4 and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god to know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and then it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons all the way back in the garden the serpent now begins to tempt the woman and the woman under the temptation she begins to look at the tree and she notices the tree that it was good for food that it was a pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise those every one of those things are self-fulfilling self-rewarding so all the way back in the garden when the woman was tempted she was tempted with her own desire versus the will of god versus the word of god and god's word is his will so it goes all the way back to the beginning and when she's enticed she's drawn away of her own lust and enticed amen she begins to look at this tree and it's desirable it's good for food that's for her his desire will make her wise that's for her amen it's all for her and so now she she is willingly deceived because she's wanting what she's seeing and she's not willing to lay down her own want her own desire to stick with the word of god she now begins to see this as good this is right we should do this but it's in according to her own will her own desire so all the way back it was a desire of a person over the word of god and her choice reflected what she really wanted what she really wanted brother bam said she wanted to know about this thing she really wanted to know what it was and so when she was enticed she really wanted to know but instead of just giving up all knowledge and all understanding and staying with the word amen she was entitled amen and led away of her own lusts and i'd just like to say this if god now has restored back the last adam and the last adam now made a choice will there have to be a woman that makes her choice in the beginning in the fall first the woman made her choice then the man made his choice the woman made her choice for adultery then the man made his choice to take her back is that true she made her choice he made his choice now we come down through the last adam's been restored and now the man made his choice first this time now he made his choice first what have we been waiting on why when he made his choice amen why wasn't it all over because we've got to restore back amen and there's a law of free choice here the man has made his choice and i believe the woman has to make her choice and we've come to the hour for the the woman to make her choice to surrender her life to lay it all down and choose the word and the word only amen to surrender everything else to the headship of the word which is her husband amen and not take any other word not take any other idea no matter how difficult it is no matter how how much we want it or don't want it amen it's time to throw all of that away there's time amen in the redemption cycle for there to be a woman if there was a last adam will there be a last woman a last eve amen in the cycle of redemption will there be a woman on earth that will take the word that will go through her gethsemane that will prevail that will wrestle it out and overcome brother branham says in desperations 1963 he said our dear lord jesus himself and the world's great battleground gethsemane what if brother called guy sent me the world's great battleground gethsemane he cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do hear what the prophet said jesus wanted to stay on earth with his beloved disciples that was his will that was his desire that's what he wanted to do he did not want to separate from them he did not want his love for them was was holding them him to them and them to him and that's what he was so grieved about he didn't want to separate should he take the sins of the world what what is this this is the greatest battleground gethsemane he cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do but watch his humility as he humbled himself not my will but thine be done humbled himself to the word the promised word of god of the god of heaven notice then he went a little further and if we went a little if he went a little farther how much more are we to go a little farther and notice the scripture says here in luke that he prayed earnestly brother sister if jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly we've been talking about this for some time amen that that you know even elijah when he prayed earnestly it rained not amen there was a fervency and prayer a desire and prayer and earnestness and prayer and even jesus in order to overcome had to pray earnesty he went a little further and he prayed more earnestly and if jesus had to pray earnestly are we going to get it done in 30 seconds over coffee before we go to work but i'm bright i'm chosen i'm predestinated so was jesus he was chosen he was predestinated he was the one the prophecies were all about he was the fulfillment of the prophecies and he agonized amen he wrestled it out he prayed fervently if he had to pray fervently what do we have to do he prayed earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if christ the god of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly how much more are we sinners saved by grace to pray earnestly if the decision throw the son of god into despair what will it do to you and i desperately we must cry this is why i don't believe that it's going to be as easy as we thought it was this is why i don't believe it's going to be a skipping through the meadows as we go to the fullness of redemption but i think if if there's got to come a test amen the bride must be tested on the word amen and she must stay with every word how will that test come oh listen friends i would love it if that test would come in a tribunal where i stand before a panel full of denominational ministers and they say if you if you don't pass this test we'll take you over here and cut your head off i say praise god i'll take that but i don't think that's the way it's going to come i think it's going to come down so personal amen i believe it's going to come down so personal to you amen it's going to be so agonizing to you my goodness most of us relish the opportunity to tell the whole world what we believe and go quickly over have her head cut off and go into the sixth dimension praise god amen go down in a flurry friends if you're going to go out go out good. but i don't think what's going to be like this time it might be so close it breaks your heart might be so tight you have to make such decisions that you you don't want to be here you don't want to be making these choices you don't want to be wrestling this out because the the bride's got to have the same character he has the bride's got to be made out of the same material he was made out of he was the word she has to be the word but she's predestinated not to fail he was predestinated not to fail do you understand he was predestinated but he was not forced he didn't have the full anointing of the spirit on him carrying him all the way through it left him in gethsemane he made his choice when he wrestled it out are we going to have to make our choice as we wrestle it out i believe it's happening all the time it's happening in relationships it's happening in circumstances circumstances at work circumstances with family circumstances with the world all kinds of circumstances are bringing us face to face with the word and are we going to take the word are we going to take our own will are we going to repeat what eve did we can't have a repeat of what he did this is the last days this is the end time we can't have a repeat of the church ages we can't have any more somebody taking their own will or taking the words of a man over the word of god we can't have that anymore we can't have somebody shirking the responsibility and putting it off on the ministry we can't have that anymore we can't anymore have somebody claiming ignorance this isn't the age of ignorance the seals have been open the word has been restored we can't have any more somebody just sitting on their heels waiting for god to do it god's already done it all amen he's opened the seals he's given back the title deed he's brought the book down this isn't the time to wait wait for god to do something he's done it wait for some ministry to do it that's not what we're waiting on but we're each individually one by one being brought face to face with the word and we're being tested on what we'll do with the word and that task i don't believe is going to be you know you stand up before a panel at work and says if you don't believe in homosexual marriage you're fired i say i don't believe in homosexual marriage fire me please i'd love to suffer for his name's sake maybe i have a feeling it's going to be tighter than that i feel like it's going to be more of a wrestling match than that more of a surrender more of a death to self more of a showing that she's of the same character he's of and remember friends no matter how tight it gets and how much agony that you're under and how how much uh how much heartbreak you're under just remember if you could just reflect back and say i've already done this once because when he was in gethsemane i was there i was with him the bride had not been separated from the bridegroom yet they were together that's how god knows she won't fail she didn't fail there shall not fail here just as willing as he was when he was carrying the attributes of god with him to calvary when he was wrestling in gethsemane you were there you have no knowledge of it amen but you were there as part of the word he was the fullness of the word wrestling and out when he was wrestling it out you were there when he was overcoming you were there when he went to calvary you were there already the word has overcome that means for sure in this day the word will overcome but it'll overcome the same way when the vessel that the word is working through surrenders itself completely the power of free choice has everything to do with the threefold purpose of god god had one plan and one purpose one thing that he wanted to achieve and the entire bible had been telling it and all the characters have been displaying it and that threefold purpose that one plan is manifesting a threefold purpose first to get pre-eminence in a man what is that that's a man fully surrendered to the will of god that's preeminence he did that in christ jesus second to have preeminence and a bride and a church and a people he's doing that now what is that that's free choice free choice has everything to do with the threefold purpose of god so god had a purpose before the foundation of the world and that purpose before the foundation of the world is hinged on your free choice what what god had a plan before the foundation of the world and he's depending on me to make my choice for his great plan yes every attribute of god has to overcome by the word every part of god has to overcome by the word we we look at three more like we got three more ladies i can choose this and i can choose that there's a great power that comes with that and a great responsibility that comes with that that caused the fall in heaven that caused the fallen eden that caused christ to go to calvary to buy back redemption the fall and redemption are moved into place by free choice think about that the fall was brought about by free choice redemption is moved into place by free choice i say god help us to choose god you know we sing that song i surrender all i think we can wake up and sing it every morning then an hour later we should sing it again and 30 minutes after that we should sing it again because what is he looking for in this day to bring the finishing of his plan he's looking for preeminence in a bride he has to have first place total control the headship and the body are united and the headship is moving through the body because the body is completely surrendered to that headship to the word god has to have his way i'm going to read this quote i just i just made this statement but i want to back it up with this quote in the message it is the rising of the sun he said the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which was human flesh if he had went up there as god he'd have never died that kind of death can't kill god but he didn't have to do it and remember he went there with you and him god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride brother brahm comes to the message the unveiling of god and in paragraph three or three says he died to reveal himself to us now let us let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to the traditions and things to reveal him to the other die to the denominations to reveal him to others he died to reveal himself to us let us die to reveal him to others let us surrender let us prevail let us wrestle with and overcome oh if i could just get a hold of that devil if i could just i'd wring his neck i hate statements like that you know i hate him because they're absolutely foolish this creature was full of wisdom the sum of beauty was summed up in him he was so deceptive he could deceive the angels in heaven and you're talking like you could go just take him and ring his neck and even michael when he was disputing with with lucifer over the body over the with the devil over the body of moses he brought not a railing accusation against him but he said the lord deal with thee i think it's foolish and childish to talk like that i think when we talk about you know if i could just punch him in the nose if i could just ring his neck i grew i grew up i grew up in a pentecostal church and we talked about the devil like that all the time while he was deceiving the whole works while they were stuck in denominationalism and trinitarian baptisms and and marriage and re uh divorce and remarriage issues running rampant through the whole church and they were punching the devil and wringing his neck and calling him stupid i say if you want to ring somebody's neck ring your own neck if you want to beat somebody down beat the same one paul was beating because paul was keeping under his body he was bringing it into slavery unless when he preached to others he himself should be a castaway paul was not acting silly and foolish amen brother bam told us that the devil's a worthy adversary because god needed a worthy adversary let's not talk like little kids amen but let's get down to business and say really if i want to defeat the devil i've got to be defeat the devil in me if i'm really going to give him a black eye then i've got to lay this flesh down so the word can move through this flesh that'll give him a black eye if i really want to stomp on him what i got to do is subdue this outer man and bring it in subjection to the word and let the spirit of god flow through me to manifest the word for the hour and then he'll get a black eye then it'll get stomped on the head then he'll be defeated jesus won the victory in gethsemane and that wasn't a jumping up and down and stomping and calling the devil names it was a wrestling with his own will looking to his friends for support asking god again if this could pass by what was he doing he was wrestling it all out and he was overcoming and when he finally subdued his own flesh when he finally subdued his own will he goes back to his friends and said take your rest asleep all is well the son of man has already betrayed into the hands of sinners but it's okay oh if the devil ever got a black eye it was right there if the evil devil ever got stomped on the head it was right there amen if he ever lost a battle it was right there in gethsemane when jesus christ won back eden and i i'm so tired of hearing rhetoric what we need is a life amen we don't need words and tap rallies and speech what we need is the manifestation of the life of jesus christ one who would only do the father's will we need a people on this earth that will only do the father's will amen brother bran he gives that quote and he says what we need now is thousands of lived lives that's the thunder that shakes the devil what is it live lives amen we don't need to thunder with our mouths we need to thunder with our lives we need to surrender we need to take this word and put this word on and make everything be the word we need to prevail he prevailed now it's our turn to prevail i want to overcome if you want to overcome then you need to wrestle in your own gethsemane with your own will if you want to overcome you need to go and labor in prayer fervently and lay down your life to the will and word of god brother brahm says in christ the mystery of god revealed he said predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to the word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand praise god we're predestinated if it wasn't for predestination it would be impossible you cannot choose god unless god has first chose you you cannot make that stand unless you're predestinated to make that stand but just because you're predestinated to make that sand does not mean it's not going to happen without wrestling with fervent prayer with sacrifice and a laying down of your life because that's what happened to jesus christ he goes on and christ is the mystery of god revealed to say denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did he even know it but she fell but this one knows it and won't fall she's ordained hallelujah she's ordained to not fall she won't fall she's predestinated to it oh praise god the next time we get in our wrestling match where we've got to make a choice to choose the word remember you're predestinated not to fall doesn't mean you won't wrestle it doesn't mean you won't pray doesn't mean you won't ask god is there any other way god but you're predestinated not to fall when you get down to wrestle it out when you're subjecting this man to the word of god and pulling him down you remember i'm predestinated not to fall it's not me there's a he's got his will backing up this i can do it i can do it by his grace but i've got to make the choice i've got to make the decision he can't do that part for me i've got to choose he can't lay down my life i have to lay down my life jesus life wasn't taken from him he laid it down jesus will wasn't taken from him he laid it down he you're predestinated like he's predestinated you're part of the word like he's part of the word but your will won't be taken away it'll be laid down and your life won't be taken away it'll be surrendered i say let's get in the business of surrendering let's go back to revelation chapter 12. i want to finish with this scripture musicians you can start making your way up brother ben you can come up as well revelations chapter 12. revelations 12 and 11. we've read this many many times and they overcame him this word overcame is the exact same word as prevail in revelation chapter 5 when the line of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book and loose the seals it's the exact same greek word to prevail he prevailed we overcome and they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death they were willing to lay down their lives and surrender for him he prevailed so she can prevail he's already prevailed now we can prevail what did his prevailing look like a full surrender to the will and word of god what will our prevailing look like a full surrender to the will and the word of god remember eden was lost when somebody exerted their will over the word eden was lost heaven sin broke out in heaven when somebody exerted their will over the will of god eden fell when somebody exerted their will over the word of god but eden was won back when somebody laid down their will for the word of god redemption the fall came through adam the redemption comes through the last adam he's overcome now he's asking us to overcome not by strength or by might but by a spirit he'll do all of that what he's asking us to do is lay down our lives surrender give up so that he can do all that he's called that he's promised to do in this last time we've come to the time of god's great plan and in that time of god's great plan we've come to the end of the second fold of the threefold purpose and before we can move to the third fold which is the restored eden we have to have a restored bride he's already restored adam the last adam the sun has already been restored the next fold that we're getting ready to go to is the restored eden upon the earth but in between those he's got to restore back a bride and how will he do it when he has preeminence in a body of believers here we've come to the end of that and where is he going to have preeminence at where is it going to happen where is the victory going to come when the woman is restored and makes her stand upon the word i say god by your grace let it happen right here lord give me the strength to lay down my life and surrender lord i don't want my way when it really comes down to it i don't want my way i keep falling in the same traps i keep stumbling over the same things but when i really when i get down to the depths of my heart and cry out to god i don't want my will i don't want my way i don't want my choices i just want his let's stay there friends and see god bring a great victory it's not trivial mother branham told us that great things are silent big things powerful things said the earth turns and it never creaks you don't ever hear it you can never tell millions billions of gallons of water are lifted off the earth into the sky every day and it never makes a noise these are huge powerful forces at work and it doesn't make any noise there was something powerful a huge force a huge power that was that was moving into manifestation in gethsemane but nobody saw it even the ones closest to him were asleep something powerful was taking place in the cycle of redemption something that was going to change everything was taking place in gethsemane and nobody was even awake to watch it was one man wrestling it out with his own will and surrendering himself to god and that one man not in the eyes of anybody else with no noise that anybody could hear with nothing that you could see with an outward demonstration that would show the power what he was doing was making a decision he was making a choice he was exercising the power of free moral agency and he was the right one at the right time making the right choice and when he did he won back eden who saw it who knew it how much noise was there now we've come to the end time to the restoration of the bride tree when there's going to be a bride reflect the very same character that man in gethsemane and she's going to take her stand on the word she's going to be tested by the word and she's not going to fail she's predestinated not to fall and what's it going to look like how loud is it going to be how many people will be even spiritually awake enough to see it happen it might be taking place in your prayer closet when you're by yourself at work when you're driving down the road amen it may not be the great big thing that everybody says oh look at this powerful move it's the power of free choice and the right person at the right time making the right choice and it's moving the plan of redemption forward we talk about power that's power so god help me to surrender to your word me exercise my free choice and choose you over everything else in this world choose you don't get caught up in hoopla get down to business don't worry about what's going on all over the place and the news and all over you know there's hurricanes and fires and tornadoes and political unrest and it's not going to get any better [Music] i mean once you read this article they're going to come out with the next article and it's going to be all the same stuff with a few different names in a few different locations and it's going to keep cycling like that it's not going to get any better so let's not be distracted by any of that and it's time to get down in fervency and prayer and say lord i want a greater surrender in my life i want to i want to die to myself more because that's what it's going to take that's what's going to move this plan of redemption for man let's all stand god bless you i was in gethsemane i just don't remember it i was on calvary not in this form but the real me the sea gene of god was there i was there this this attribute of god's overcome before it'll overcome again but god has put that attribute in a vessel and that vessel he's given life to a certain consciousness and all that stuff and he's allowed us an opportunity to surrender it all to let this life on the inside live god has set up the mechanism of free choice maybe we don't fully understand why he did it that way why it was in heaven that way and in eden that way and all down through time maybe we can't figure out all the reasons why it was that way but it was that way it's become the power that has moved god's plan along the the mind of the thought that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world it's been moving forward because of this power of free choice and so now we're coming to the end of that and the power of free choice is still moving the plan of redemption among but it's happening in your prayer closet and in my prayer closet it's happening when nobody else is hearing you pray and nobody else is understanding the agony you're under nobody else knows the the the terrible uh grief that you're experiencing nobody else knows how hard it is for you to make these choices amen but it's still the choice that's winning the victory it's surrendering to him i say let's not grow weary and giving our lives up for him let us not get tired of surrendering let us not get lazy but let's continually say lord i lay my life down for you when you're confronted with more of the word say lord i surrender to that more of the word when you're confronted with the decision in the word say lord i'm gonna take the word and give up my life and give up my own choice and give up my own will and wish to have your word and you'll be unlocking a powerful force that'll keep redemption marking forward trust in it keep surrendering to it let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus oh father god what can we say lord what can we say lord but we're your people lord and we believe you've called us for this hour that you've predestinated us god we've you've heard what we've said we've seen your scriptures we watched your suffering in gethsemane and your victory god help us to just yield ourselves to you lord i want more than anything to surrender i want more than anything the privilege of laying my life down of surrendering my will sometimes lord it's so hard don't do all he's like i wish but lord you know my heart and my desire god as you present opportunities lord we desire to surrender we desire to lay our life down nor
