[31:50] we were traveling to the service last
[31:52] night and
[31:53] uh we love to talk we love to fellowship
[31:56] amongst ourselves and as a as a part of
[31:59] the family of God and the uh the
[32:02] conversation come up as we were
[32:04] traveling to church about boundaries
[32:07] um ministering in someone else's uh
[32:10] pulford and um
[32:12] and uh brother Brown talks about it and
[32:15] and I said to them I said yeah you know
[32:17] there's one thing I'd like to know about
[32:20] how how brother Chad sees adoption
[32:25] and then when we got to church we got to
[32:27] the service last night my brother said
[32:29] well I'm going to preach on adoption
[32:31] I didn't need to ask for the chat after
[32:33] that because he was sitting right beside
[32:35] me he was just banging me on the leg you
[32:37] know big smile on his house and we were
[32:40] enjoying ourselves it was it was a real
[32:42] blessing and the Lord does things to
[32:45] encourage us
[32:46] and uh sometimes a minister will take
[32:49] any
[32:50] any small encouragement you you know you
[32:54] might think that's insignificant but to
[32:56] a minister that's huge so we we just
[32:59] take those little things and say thank
[33:01] you Lord amen amen let's um turn in our
[33:05] Bibles tonight to the Book of Genesis
[33:07] chapter 22. we we looked at this uh
[33:11] story last night uh sorry on Wednesday
[33:14] night
[33:15] I'd like to read from verse one
[33:20] you can put that slide up thanks brother
[33:23] the the thought that I want to take
[33:25] tonight is is taken from a verse we'll
[33:28] we'll get to it shortly but let's read
[33:30] from verse one
[33:31] and it came to pass after these things
[33:34] that God did tempt Abraham and said unto
[33:37] him Abraham
[33:38] and he said behold here I am
[33:43] and he said take now thy son thine only
[33:46] son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[33:50] into the land of Moriah and offer him
[33:53] there for a burnt offering upon one of
[33:56] the mountains which I will tell thee of
[33:59] and Abraham rose up early in the morning
[34:02] and saddled his ass and took two of his
[34:05] young men with him
[34:07] and Isaac his son enclaved the wood of
[34:11] for the burnt offering and Rose up and
[34:14] went unto the place which God had told
[34:17] him
[34:18] then on the third day Abraham lifted up
[34:20] his eyes and saw the place
[34:23] are far off
[34:25] and Abraham said unto his young men
[34:28] abide here with the ass and I and the
[34:32] lad will go Yonder and worship and come
[34:36] again
[34:37] to you
[34:38] and Abraham took the wood for the burnt
[34:41] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[34:46] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[34:51] knife and they went both of them
[34:53] together
[34:55] and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father
[34:58] and said
[35:00] my father and he said here I am
[35:05] my son and he said behold the fire and
[35:08] the wood but where is the Lamb for the
[35:11] burnt offering
[35:12] and Abraham said my son God will provide
[35:17] himself a lamb
[35:19] for a burnt offering
[35:22] so they went both of them together
[35:26] and they came to the place which God had
[35:29] told him of
[35:31] and Abraham built an altar and laid the
[35:34] wood in order and bound Isaac his son
[35:38] and laid him on the altar upon the wood
[35:43] and Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[35:46] took the knife to slay his son
[35:50] and the angel of the Lord
[35:52] called unto him out of heaven
[35:56] and said Abraham Abraham
[36:00] and he said here am I
[36:05] and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[36:09] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[36:13] for I know for now I know that thou
[36:16] fearest God seeing that thou Hast not
[36:19] withheld thy son
[36:22] thy only son from me
[36:25] and then and Abraham lifted up his eyes
[36:28] and looked behold behind him
[36:32] a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns
[36:35] and Abraham went and took the RAM and
[36:38] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[36:41] the stead of his son
[36:43] and Abraham called the name of the place
[36:47] Jehovah-jireh as it is said to this day
[36:51] in the Mount of the Lord it shall be
[36:56] seen amen may the Lord add the blessing
[36:59] to the reading of his word as you take
[37:01] your seats
[37:04] amen you thankful to be here tonight
[37:07] amen amen it's wonderful to be in the
[37:10] presence of the Lord and
[37:13] come here to worship Him amen and spirit
[37:15] and in truth
[37:17] amen I'd just like to take a thought
[37:19] from here as the the scripture has said
[37:23] here
[37:24] but I've I've we know that Abraham said
[37:27] but I want to place this into our own
[37:30] lives tonight
[37:31] because I think it's important that we
[37:33] look at the word not not as something
[37:35] that of history but something that is
[37:38] happening in our lives present tense
[37:41] amen so I want to take where where
[37:43] Abraham Abraham said here I am we want
[37:48] to put this into our own lives and and I
[37:51] said here am I
[37:54] amen and as a as a subtopic he would
[37:57] just like to look at the identified
[37:59] masterpiece
[38:01] family amen so we we understand that the
[38:05] prophet when he first preached
[38:06] Masterpiece he titled it Masterpiece
[38:09] that was in
[38:10] 640705 and then in 64 1205 he's he
[38:15] preached the message the identified
[38:17] masterpiece
[38:20] so the first thing that he preached was
[38:21] the Masterpiece the second second
[38:24] service that he took on this thought he
[38:26] he titled the identified
[38:29] Masterpiece amen so the the the
[38:31] preeminent
[38:34] um thought here is that there is a
[38:36] masterpiece but this masterpiece is not
[38:39] unidentified
[38:41] this masterpiece is identified he didn't
[38:44] say I'm I'm preaching on the
[38:46] unidentified Masterpiece the first thing
[38:49] he did was to reveal that there was a
[38:51] masterpiece the second thing he did was
[38:54] to reveal that there is a an identified
[38:58] Masterpiece amen it's one thing to know
[39:01] that there is a masterpiece but then
[39:03] it's another thing to know that this
[39:05] masterpiece is actually identified amen
[39:09] and we as we saw on Wednesday night this
[39:11] is not something that we can rely on our
[39:14] pastors Revelation our father's
[39:16] Revelation our wives Revelation we've
[39:19] got to have this Revelation for ourself
[39:21] of the identified
[39:24] Masterpiece amen we we looked at this
[39:27] story here in Genesis 22 on Wednesday
[39:31] night how God in in verse 1 told Abraham
[39:36] about a place that he had provided for
[39:40] him to worship and he told him the
[39:42] general direction of it that it was in
[39:45] the land of Moriah
[39:47] and God had provided this place for
[39:50] Abraham to Worship in and I think this
[39:54] is really important for our lives
[39:55] because God has provided us a place of
[39:58] worship and God will not accept your
[40:01] worship outside of that place
[40:04] amen it doesn't matter what type of
[40:06] things we might think but this requires
[40:10] us to surrender our own thoughts to come
[40:13] into the very manifested thoughts of God
[40:16] so that our worship can be accepted
[40:20] amen I I think it's a it's a shame it's
[40:24] a it's a a shame when we can go to all
[40:27] this trouble but then our worship not be
[40:30] accepted
[40:32] amen just refreshing ourselves here a
[40:34] little bit from Wednesday night but God
[40:36] when when David went to bring the ark
[40:39] back to the Lord the idea was right but
[40:42] the way he did it was wrong
[40:44] he had the right idea but he did it the
[40:46] wrong way and the reason that he did it
[40:49] the wrong way is because he was
[40:51] influenced by a denominational spirit
[40:53] and he thought that he could do what
[40:56] they did but God has a place God has a
[40:59] way that he wants to be worshiped and he
[41:03] will allow others to worship however
[41:05] they want to worship but he will not
[41:07] allow his elect to worship the way that
[41:11] they desire to worship God desires us to
[41:15] worship him the way that he desires to
[41:18] be worshiped amen and that is why the
[41:21] prophet of God said that that that he
[41:24] that God had to reject the whole thing
[41:28] because David did one thing wrong
[41:32] in the way that he bought the art that
[41:35] the word back he put it on a new cart he
[41:38] had to reject the whole thing amen so we
[41:42] we want to do what God wants us to do
[41:45] God's way
[41:47] Amen in God's provided place of worship
[41:51] amen that that's where we want to be
[41:54] that's where we need to be so God had
[41:57] had told Abraham that he'd provided a
[42:00] place and that place was going to be
[42:03] revealed in verse 2 uh God Abraham went
[42:08] to that place that God had told him of
[42:11] in verse 3 Abraham saw that place
[42:15] um that God had told him of and then in
[42:18] verse 9 Abraham came to that place
[42:23] that God had now revealed
[42:27] um where he's worshiped Abraham's
[42:30] worship was going to be accepted from
[42:33] amen so we are thankful we are thankful
[42:37] in this hour that God has revealed his
[42:40] thoughts to us
[42:41] amen because without his thoughts being
[42:44] revealed there's not a lot of chance for
[42:47] us to be able to be worshiping knowing
[42:50] that God was accepting our worship
[42:53] amen there should not be a question in
[42:55] our minds whether God is accepting our
[42:57] worship or not because the thoughts of
[42:59] God have been revealed
[43:01] amen Abraham didn't have the question I
[43:04] don't know if God's going to accept what
[43:05] I'm doing you know no he was doing what
[43:08] God had asked him to do in God's
[43:10] provided place
[43:12] amen he was doing what God had asked him
[43:15] to do in God's provided place I like I
[43:20] like this thought because Abraham
[43:22] learned from his first experience
[43:24] remember God spoke to Abram and said
[43:28] Abraham leave thy father and of my
[43:30] mother and go to a land in which I will
[43:32] show you and Abraham took lot but God
[43:35] didn't take say to take lot
[43:37] that God took Lord Abraham took lot
[43:40] right but we understand that when
[43:42] Abraham came to the place where he was
[43:45] about to enter into this place where God
[43:48] had provided for him he said you stay
[43:52] here
[43:53] and I and the lad will go
[43:56] right because he took two servants with
[43:58] him but they could only come so far
[44:00] all right because God this was God
[44:03] Abraham's provided place of worship
[44:06] amen sir we thank God for this
[44:09] opportunity that he has given us to have
[44:12] a confidence in what we are doing in the
[44:16] place in which we are knowing that God
[44:18] is in fact accepting our worship
[44:21] I I think it would be a a pitiful thing
[44:24] to come to a place like this and go to
[44:26] all this trouble and spend all this
[44:28] money and then wonder whether God is
[44:31] accepting our worship or not amen but we
[44:34] are thankful in this hour that the mind
[44:36] of God has been revealed to us
[44:39] amen
[44:41] we see here in um I don't know if you've
[44:44] still got your Bibles open to Genesis
[44:47] 22. I just want to take a couple of
[44:50] thoughts here
[44:53] um from Genesis 22
[44:56] we see here looking at verse 11
[44:59] that Abraham is responding
[45:04] to the voice of God
[45:06] from a different position
[45:09] that he responded to the voice of God in
[45:13] verse 1.
[45:15] okay if you look at verse 1 Genesis 22 1
[45:19] and it came to pass after these things
[45:22] that God did tempt Abraham and said unto
[45:27] him Abraham and he said behold here am I
[45:31] it was the same Abraham the same voice
[45:35] but a different place
[45:37] all right we can go down to verse 11.
[45:41] um Genesis 22 11 and the angel of the
[45:44] Lord called unto him out of heaven and
[45:47] said Abraham Abraham and he said here am
[45:53] I
[45:54] all right so it was the same voice the
[45:57] same Abraham but his position had
[46:00] changed
[46:01] amen it's it's like the Lord spoke to
[46:04] John and in Revelations chapter 3 and
[46:08] the spirit of the lord caught John up
[46:11] and took John to a higher place it was
[46:13] the same voice that was speaking to him
[46:16] in Revelations 3 that was speaking to
[46:19] him in Revelation 4. all right but his
[46:22] position had changed
[46:24] amen and the emphasis is on the position
[46:28] amen all right you can see there in
[46:30] verse 1 the the here is a in a in a
[46:34] lower font it's just a it's not if you
[46:37] look at verse 11 it's in a capital here
[46:40] is in a capital
[46:42] so the emphasis is the position right
[46:45] here am I here am I all right this this
[46:50] place that Abraham was was now
[46:53] responding to the to the same voice was
[46:57] a revelation to him he knew where he was
[47:00] he knew where he stood he knew that he
[47:04] was in God's provided place of worship
[47:07] here am I amen here at my the place was
[47:12] a revelation to him and so was Abraham a
[47:16] revelation unto himself
[47:19] amen
[47:20] amen amen the last thing God wants is
[47:23] for you to be dependent upon your pastor
[47:26] for the revelation of yourself
[47:29] amen God wants you to be a revelation to
[47:33] yourself
[47:34] amen he said that's his desire for you
[47:37] he doesn't want you relying upon your
[47:40] pastor your pastor's revelation of you
[47:43] he wants God wants you to have a
[47:45] revelation of yourself but he also wants
[47:49] you to have a revelation of the place in
[47:53] which you are operating from amen the
[47:56] place in which you stand the place the
[47:59] place like the place that Abraham was
[48:01] now standing it was a revelation to him
[48:04] it was something that God had revealed
[48:08] to him
[48:09] it was something that God was sorry
[48:12] Abraham was now in Union with him
[48:16] with that place
[48:18] amen and as we saw on Wednesday night in
[48:21] that place all things are possible
[48:25] in that place all things are possible in
[48:28] that place you reach your full potential
[48:31] in that place you reach your full
[48:34] purpose
[48:35] amen we thank God Amen it's a it's a
[48:38] it's a revelation
[48:41] that place is a revelation
[48:44] God called Abraham
[48:47] the Lord calls us
[48:51] by the opening of the word
[48:54] by the revealing of the word God calls
[48:58] us
[48:59] and we respond to the opening of the
[49:02] word he doesn't call us as in our
[49:05] literal name but he opens the word in
[49:08] the opening of the word calls the elect
[49:11] unto itself
[49:14] amen so God God is still calling yes
[49:18] it's very obvious in my life that God is
[49:21] still calling amen so when the when the
[49:25] when the mystery of the word is revealed
[49:28] it calls
[49:30] it unto itself
[49:35] when when God took a part of Adam and
[49:38] created his his wife
[49:42] and then God bought the wife to Adam his
[49:47] wife Adam's wife to himself
[49:50] Adam was speaking to a part of himself
[49:54] amen amen Adam wasn't speaking to
[49:56] anything else he wasn't speaking to the
[49:58] chimpanzee or the lion or anything else
[50:01] that everything else was not designed to
[50:05] respond to the word
[50:08] amen it was only the part that came out
[50:11] of Adam that it was God had designed to
[50:15] respond to the word that was coming from
[50:20] the part from him in whom she came out
[50:24] of
[50:25] amen and that is what they select God
[50:28] has designed you this way amen all right
[50:31] we're going to look think about a design
[50:33] a little bit tonight God has designed
[50:36] you specifically because of who he is
[50:40] and because of where you come from
[50:42] because you're a part of him you are
[50:46] designed to respond to the word
[50:50] amen and it doesn't matter what God asks
[50:53] of you you are designed to respond to
[50:58] the word that's that Faith seed right we
[51:01] we cannot understand carnally how
[51:04] Abraham was willing as he was to take
[51:07] his son his only son and go and
[51:10] sacrifice his son his only son but we
[51:14] understand that there is a faith seed a
[51:17] royal seed within Abraham that God had
[51:20] so desired to respond to the word amen
[51:24] amen and that's what you are oh that's
[51:28] what you are ordained of God to do as a
[51:30] part of him is to respond to the word
[51:34] amen people might think that God's
[51:37] requests are unreasonable
[51:40] amen but we don't consider God's
[51:43] requests from our logic
[51:46] or from our mind we simply respond to
[51:50] the word
[51:52] all right where where vashti failed
[51:55] Esther didn't
[51:56] because as vashti considered the request
[52:01] through her logic through her mind all
[52:05] right but but when it was Esther's time
[52:08] to enter into that place there was an un
[52:12] an unheard voice that was calling her
[52:15] unto himself and as unreasonable as it
[52:20] might seem she didn't consider it no
[52:24] she just simply walked in amen
[52:28] amen amen and that's what this elected
[52:30] bride is ordained to do in the hour in
[52:35] which we are living in in this hour
[52:36] today God is calling his elect by the
[52:41] opening of the word
[52:44] amen
[52:46] so we thank God for what he's doing in
[52:48] our life
[52:49] we can think about this on a natural
[52:51] level
[52:53] that the only way that my wife has the
[52:55] position that she has
[52:57] is one because the word that was spoken
[53:02] to her
[53:05] two because she accepted the word
[53:09] that was spoken to her because she could
[53:12] not be my wife unless first the
[53:15] invitation came
[53:18] but she also could not be then the door
[53:21] was opened the opportunity was given to
[53:23] her to become right but then she had to
[53:27] accept that invitation and say here I am
[53:31] here I am here am I
[53:34] hey man what what what was Abraham was a
[53:38] revelation unto himself here am I it's
[53:42] both position and identification here am
[53:46] I here am I when my wife said yes she
[53:51] was saying here am I
[53:54] amen it's a it's a it's a revelation
[53:57] it's a revelation of the word
[54:00] it's a revelation of who you are in
[54:04] Christ
[54:06] amen we are super thankful yes
[54:10] to God
[54:11] for who we can say we are
[54:15] and where we stand
[54:18] because we could not be Who We Are and
[54:23] we could not stand where we stand
[54:26] without God in our lives
[54:29] without God doing what he has done in
[54:33] our lives I could not stand where I
[54:36] stand amen Abraham could say the same
[54:39] thing there is no way possible that
[54:42] Abraham could do what he'd done and be
[54:46] where he was without God revealing his
[54:49] provided place of worship amen amen here
[54:57] I am
[54:59] so we want to look at this tonight the
[55:01] identified masterpiece
[55:05] here I am
[55:10] amen the identified masterpiece
[55:15] family
[55:17] I'm a member of God's family
[55:20] amen here am I
[55:24] amen we must be a revelation
[55:28] unto ourself
[55:30] amen amen this quotation here
[55:35] the new birth is Christ
[55:39] is a revelation
[55:42] God has revealed to you this great
[55:46] mystery
[55:47] and that's a new birth now what are you
[55:50] going to do when you get all that group
[55:54] together where the Revelation is
[55:56] perfectly in Harmony and God expresses
[56:00] it through his word by the same actions
[56:05] the same things that he did making the
[56:10] word manifest
[56:11] or if the church could only knew its
[56:16] position
[56:17] and will one day then the Rapture will
[56:21] go when it knows what it is
[56:26] amen where are we at bride I meant where
[56:31] are we at here am I
[56:35] amen we are at this place
[56:38] amen we are at this place that she knows
[56:42] who she is and she knows where she
[56:46] stands here am I
[56:50] hey man what what what will you do
[56:54] when when all that group come together
[56:57] what is that group it's the Masterpiece
[57:00] family
[57:02] I'm at the Masterpiece family will have
[57:05] the same Revelation as one another
[57:09] amen here am I
[57:12] wonderful wonderful God is good amen
[57:15] amen amen so tonight I hope this doesn't
[57:20] seem like a bit of a deviation from the
[57:23] thought here but
[57:25] I just want to look at this in a natural
[57:28] sense from the things that man has has
[57:32] been able to accomplish in our day
[57:36] because man has accomplished some
[57:39] to me
[57:41] unaccomplishable things
[57:44] that it's like the supernatural it's
[57:46] like man has naturally entered into the
[57:49] supernatural in a natural sense in a
[57:53] carnal sense
[57:54] and I want to look at this tonight
[57:56] because it's um very I think it's very
[57:59] important you know when when the man
[58:02] landed on the on the moon you know
[58:04] brother Branham talked about how we've
[58:06] entered into that astronaut age and he
[58:09] he talked about those things but I I
[58:12] don't know if anybody has been aware of
[58:15] I assume you would of what NASA has
[58:17] accomplished
[58:19] um after 10 years of putting these
[58:22] things together
[58:23] but they have sent uh a telescope called
[58:28] the James Webb Telescope on the 25th of
[58:31] December 2021 into into the into the
[58:36] orbit
[58:37] um so they launched this telescope it's
[58:40] called the the James uh web telescope
[58:45] and
[58:47] I'm just going to take a few things a
[58:50] few thoughts from here
[58:53] um
[58:54] it's truly miraculous what what they've
[58:56] done is just absolutely outstanding I
[58:58] don't know if you've you've thought
[59:00] about it or looked into it or not but
[59:03] um it's really really tremendous it's
[59:07] this is just a little
[59:09] um one minute
[59:12] um motion picture of this of what
[59:16] they've done with or the unfolding of
[59:19] this of this telescope
[59:23] just to give you a little bit of an idea
[59:26] of of what man is achieving
[59:33] brother Franco helped me with this this
[59:35] was about three minutes or four minutes
[59:37] long and he managed to shorten it down
[59:39] for me to about a minute so
[59:50] it took 10 years to make
[59:53] started in 2011
[1:00:05] so you can see here that it's it's
[1:00:07] unfolding
[1:00:08] it's developing
[1:00:12] things are coming into place
[1:00:14] okay so hopefully you can see this okay
[1:00:19] yeah that's all right so we see this
[1:00:22] this telescope here is 1.5 million
[1:00:26] kilometers
[1:00:27] from Earth
[1:00:29] or 9 932
[1:00:32] 000 miles
[1:00:34] from Earth so man has achieved
[1:00:39] miraculous
[1:00:41] sings
[1:00:42] this telescope had to be positioned
[1:00:45] correctly
[1:00:46] you can see on the screen there
[1:00:48] hopefully you see a ll2 that's a
[1:00:50] position that they had chosen for this
[1:00:54] um this telescope to be sent to it was
[1:00:58] the best position they could find where
[1:01:01] the the things were the the currents and
[1:01:05] different things were at their minimal
[1:01:07] okay so now you've got to think about
[1:01:09] this because they were developing
[1:01:11] something on Earth
[1:01:13] to be placed 1.5 or 930 930
[1:01:18] 000 miles away
[1:01:21] so they were developing this on Earth
[1:01:23] but it's its purpose was not on Earth
[1:01:26] but its purpose was to be sent to
[1:01:29] another place and it was going to
[1:01:31] fulfill its purpose in that place
[1:01:36] the telescope was designed to meet all
[1:01:40] sorts of different challenges one of
[1:01:43] those challenges being the Heat
[1:01:45] another one of those challenges is being
[1:01:47] the cult
[1:01:49] but the the point here that I'm I'm
[1:01:51] making is that the telescope was
[1:01:53] designed to operate in a particular
[1:01:58] position but in that position the
[1:02:01] telescope was going to encounter certain
[1:02:05] challenges
[1:02:07] so it was designed specifically to meet
[1:02:10] the challenges that were related to the
[1:02:13] position that it was being sent to
[1:02:17] all right so I can tell that you're
[1:02:19] starting to put the pieces together here
[1:02:20] that's good amen so
[1:02:25] if it was not designed correctly
[1:02:29] then it would not be able to do what it
[1:02:32] was ordained to do
[1:02:34] I I think the value of this thing was 10
[1:02:37] billion dollars and it took 10 years to
[1:02:41] make
[1:02:42] but they were confident enough to be
[1:02:44] able to design this for to live in a in
[1:02:49] a atmosphere that nothing had ever lived
[1:02:52] and nothing had ever been
[1:02:55] so it was now in a position where man
[1:02:59] had never sent anything this far from
[1:03:02] Earth ever before so for the first time
[1:03:05] man had created something to take a
[1:03:09] position that man had never set never
[1:03:11] been able to do up until now
[1:03:15] all right so
[1:03:18] if this is what man can do what about
[1:03:21] what God is doing
[1:03:24] right this is not something that we're
[1:03:26] looking at that they're going to do this
[1:03:28] is something that they've done
[1:03:30] all right so if this is what man has
[1:03:33] done what has God done
[1:03:36] amen what has God done what if man can
[1:03:40] establish these such miraculous things I
[1:03:43] mean this just blows my mind I my my
[1:03:45] mind can't comprehend these things how
[1:03:48] they can how how that thing begin to
[1:03:51] unfold and develop in that position uh
[1:03:54] say it like this it came to maturity in
[1:03:57] the position that it was ordained to
[1:03:59] take
[1:04:00] outside of that position it could not
[1:04:02] come to maturity but it had to come to
[1:04:05] maturity over a period of time I think
[1:04:08] that thing that you saw within a minute
[1:04:09] took three months in real life it took
[1:04:13] three months in real life to to Lifetime
[1:04:15] to to come to to its full maturity and
[1:04:20] then be able to do what it was ordained
[1:04:23] to do that there once it was there
[1:04:28] um that there was adjustments that
[1:04:30] needed to be made and all those gold
[1:04:32] hexagon shaped things all those were
[1:04:35] were adjustable so once it was there it
[1:04:40] was adjustable so that it could do what
[1:04:43] it was ordained to do all right
[1:04:46] so man has established many things
[1:04:50] but God has
[1:04:53] God is the greater power here
[1:04:56] as as great as what this is God is the
[1:05:00] greater power
[1:05:02] if this is great God is greater amen
[1:05:05] amen if if what man has done is great
[1:05:07] what God has done is greater
[1:05:10] because God has sent a people
[1:05:13] to live in a Time
[1:05:16] that Darkness has never gripped the
[1:05:18] Earth like it has as this time amen this
[1:05:23] is what God has done this was sent but
[1:05:26] God has also sent a people onto this
[1:05:30] Earth to live under a condition in a
[1:05:33] condition that that the world has not
[1:05:36] been before but the point here is that
[1:05:39] God is the one who designed you in such
[1:05:43] a way that you will meet the challenges
[1:05:46] of this day
[1:05:48] and that God does not design anything
[1:05:50] and that thing fail
[1:05:52] this has a life expectancy of I think
[1:05:55] it's around three to five years but but
[1:05:58] this has a life expectancy of around
[1:06:01] eternity
[1:06:03] amen so so God has God is a miraculous
[1:06:08] God this is why not on a natural level
[1:06:11] they are achieving the supernatural to
[1:06:14] me because this is I can't achieve this
[1:06:16] but they they they can you know one of
[1:06:19] the quotes that one of the
[1:06:21] um technicians who put this together he
[1:06:25] said one day
[1:06:27] we want to be building these things
[1:06:31] in
[1:06:33] in the place that they're going to work
[1:06:38] think about this and you think my
[1:06:40] goodness
[1:06:42] I mean these guys have a vision
[1:06:45] these guys have a vision this started as
[1:06:48] a vision right that I mean they want to
[1:06:51] be they want to build this thing 1.5
[1:06:54] million miles away
[1:06:56] 1.5 million kilometers away
[1:06:58] yeah so God has a greater Vision than
[1:07:01] that
[1:07:02] amen amen and God is revealing his
[1:07:05] vision for you little by little and as
[1:07:08] he's as he's revealing his vision for

[1:08:42] and get you to doubt it will cause you
[1:08:44] to doubt that you can meet the
[1:08:46] challenges of this hour but if you know

[1:08:54] to meet the challenges of this day amen

[1:09:04] you to meet every challenge of this day
[1:09:07] God is a danger to reach your maturity

[1:10:58] was an unseen Force if we looked at
[1:11:01] Abraham all we saw is Abraham if we had
[1:11:04] a revelation of Abraham we'd know that
[1:11:06] there's another Force other than the
[1:11:08] force of Abraham and unseen force that
[1:11:11] was causing Abraham to do what he was
[1:11:14] ordained to do amen and there's an
[1:11:17] unseen force in the building tonight

[1:12:19] person that you don't see here tonight
[1:12:22] that is doing what I he's causing me to
[1:12:25] do what I'm doing
[1:12:29] brothers and sisters I should never have
[1:12:31] been a minister
[1:12:33] no sir
[1:12:35] no sir my first sermon that I preached
[1:12:37] was 15 minutes long
[1:12:39] you know that was the longest that I've
[1:12:41] ever spoken without stopping in my
[1:12:44] entire life never before have I spoken
[1:12:48] for more than 15 minutes my throat was
[1:12:51] so sore I had to stop
[1:12:55] by all accounts I should not be here
[1:12:59] the same as by all accounts David should
[1:13:01] not have been on that Battlefield Moses
[1:13:04] should not have been the deliverer but
[1:13:06] there was an unseen Force
[1:13:08] Sarah should not have been the one that
[1:13:10] that Faith's child was going to come
[1:13:12] through but God had chosen her and God
[1:13:15] has chosen you and God is ordained you
[1:13:18] don't look at you look at him
[1:13:21] amen there's someone other than you here
[1:13:24] tonight
[1:13:26] amen that is going to cause you to be
[1:13:28] the best husbands
[1:13:30] that there has been on Earth the best
[1:13:34] wives that has been on Earth he is going
[1:13:36] to cause you to be that
[1:13:40] we might say but right then I'm not that
[1:13:42] yet well nor am I
[1:13:44] but I'm becoming
[1:13:46] amen amen and I have a confidence that
[1:13:49] I'm going to become to my full maturity
[1:13:52] amen because of who is in me
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:57] amen greater is he
[1:14:00] that is in me then he that is trying to
[1:14:04] stunt my potential
[1:14:07] he is the greater force
[1:14:10] he's the greater force in my wife
[1:14:13] he's the greater force in my children
[1:14:17] yes sir I I I don't have a problem I
[1:14:21] don't have a concern I don't have a fear
[1:14:24] of whether my children are going to make
[1:14:26] it or not
[1:14:29] I don't because I know I believe that
[1:14:33] within them
[1:14:34] is the same one who's in me and it is no
[1:14:38] secret what God can do what he's done
[1:14:41] for me he can do for them
[1:14:43] amen if he can save me and cause me to
[1:14:46] be who I am today then surely
[1:14:50] they're in a better position than I am
[1:14:52] already
[1:14:54] amen and amen what's he going to cause
[1:14:57] us to do
[1:14:59] that's right brother then preacher
[1:15:03] what are we going to do
[1:15:05] tell you what we're going to do
[1:15:07] we're going to surrender
[1:15:09] [Music]
[1:15:12] yes sir well that's a bit of an
[1:15:14] anti-climax
[1:15:16] I thought we're going to get some
[1:15:18] banners and you know I am the elect I am
[1:15:22] the elect
[1:15:23] no we're gonna surrender
[1:15:27] that's it
[1:15:28] there's victory in surrender
[1:15:31] now that's a paradox
[1:15:33] because if you surrender in war you
[1:15:36] defeat it
[1:15:37] right but God don't God God works by
[1:15:40] paradoxes
[1:15:42] amen when we the more we surrender the
[1:15:45] more we become Victorious
[1:15:46] as her brother Alistair was saying last
[1:15:48] night the more that we surrender the
[1:15:51] more we become Victorious
[1:15:53] we will be we will be victorious to the
[1:15:57] level that we surrender
[1:15:59] if you choose to surrender at this level
[1:16:01] that's the level you will be victorious
[1:16:03] don't expect to be this Victorious when
[1:16:07] you've only surrendered to this level
[1:16:09] to the level that you surrender is the
[1:16:12] level that you will be victorious
[1:16:14] that's why Abraham was fully surrendered
[1:16:17] to the word of the Lord he was fully
[1:16:19] surrendered to the word of the Lord for
[1:16:21] his day in offering Isaac as a sacrifice
[1:16:25] because he knew that who this was he
[1:16:28] knew that this the promise of God was
[1:16:30] connected to that to his son and he knew
[1:16:34] if he had of killed him God would have
[1:16:36] to raise him up again he'd already
[1:16:38] spoken to I and the son will return unto
[1:16:41] you yeah
[1:16:44] amen Abraham didn't say that because he
[1:16:46] had another plan
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:51] Abraham didn't say I and the lad will
[1:16:53] return because he had a he had another
[1:16:56] he had another option
[1:16:59] it wasn't in Abraham's thinking Abraham
[1:17:01] knew what God was able to do Abraham
[1:17:04] knew God's word he knew who he was he
[1:17:07] knew who his son was and he knew that if
[1:17:09] if Isaac was going to die on that altar
[1:17:12] God would have to rise him up again and
[1:17:15] they'd walk back down the hill together
[1:17:17] and meet the servants and go home
[1:17:21] Abraham was the father of his household
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:25] where was Sarah at this time
[1:17:28] the prophet of God said he said Abraham
[1:17:30] never told Sarah
[1:17:32] because there's some things that the
[1:17:34] woman ain't meant to carry
[1:17:38] there's some things that are only for
[1:17:40] the father of the family
[1:17:45] amen we're not going there tonight you
[1:17:48] have to wait till tomorrow don't you
[1:17:49] preach that brother Alistair
[1:17:54] that's got a copyright tool tomorrow
[1:17:58] praise the Lord
[1:18:02] amen what are we going to do we're going
[1:18:03] to surrender
[1:18:05] that that's that's what God is causing
[1:18:08] us to do
[1:18:10] in in my life
[1:18:12] God's causing me to surrender
[1:18:15] to the fact
[1:18:16] that he chose me to minister his word
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:21] surrender yeah I've been surrendered but
[1:18:24] a complete surrender
[1:18:26] fully surrendered just Lord okay
[1:18:29] okay if if this is your will for my life
[1:18:33] I surrender to it amen amen I I I give
[1:18:36] up trying to fight it but God is going
[1:18:39] to cause each one of us
[1:18:41] to surrender to the will of God for our
[1:18:44] lives
[1:18:45] not just the minister and the musician
[1:18:48] and the song leaders but every single
[1:18:49] one of us every member of the body of
[1:18:52] Christ at some point will be completely
[1:18:55] sold out completely surrendered to the
[1:18:58] will of God for their lives meant
[1:19:02] because it's only by that complete
[1:19:05] surrender
[1:19:06] that we see God fully
[1:19:09] when you fully surrender what that means
[1:19:12] is if you surrender to a 50 level you'll
[1:19:16] probably see God to a 50 level
[1:19:18] but our desire is to express him yes
[1:19:22] our desire is to for him to manifest
[1:19:26] himself in our lives
[1:19:28] not in a portion I'm sorry but I'm not
[1:19:31] happy with 80 percent
[1:19:33] I I Lord consume me Lord amen so so you
[1:19:39] don't see me at all
[1:19:41] and and but what that's going to take is
[1:19:45] a complete surrender to the will of God
[1:19:48] for our lives the will of God is the
[1:19:51] word of God for our lives for our day
[1:19:56] we can't surrender to Moses message we
[1:19:58] can't surrender to Noah's message Moses
[1:20:00] couldn't have surrendered to Noah's
[1:20:01] message Noah that vice versa there was a
[1:20:04] word for their day
[1:20:07] and there's a word for our day
[1:20:10] all right brother Jonathan said in the
[1:20:11] prayer there's a there's a word for our
[1:20:13] day we're so thankful for it
[1:20:16] it's everything to me it's life to me
[1:20:20] but I've got to surrender to it so that
[1:20:23] that word can manifest itself through
[1:20:26] this body through this instrument of
[1:20:29] clay this vessel of clay
[1:20:32] amen and amen
[1:20:34] we we are not victims of this age
[1:20:39] there's only two types of people in this
[1:20:41] world and that's victims or people who
[1:20:44] are victorious
[1:20:46] we are not victims at least we should
[1:20:49] not be victims God has not ordained his
[1:20:52] elect to be victims oh um you know wowzy
[1:20:55] was brother Jewel four he would say yeah
[1:20:58] it's it's not we should not feel sorry
[1:21:01] for ourselves
[1:21:03] amen we're Victorious we're not victims
[1:21:07] you were built for this challenge
[1:21:10] this is your time this is your day this
[1:21:14] is your hour God designed you for this
[1:21:17] time
[1:21:18] and you're gonna meet the challenge of
[1:21:21] this day because God is causing you to
[1:21:24] fully surrender to the word for your day
[1:21:28] a full surrender
[1:21:31] amen that's what God is doing in our
[1:21:34] life
[1:21:36] Moses was born for his time
[1:21:39] Abraham was born for his time
[1:21:43] Sarah was born for her time
[1:21:46] Isaac was born for his time Rebecca was
[1:21:50] born for her Time Mary was born for her
[1:21:53] time Hannah was born for her time Jesus
[1:21:56] was born for his time Paul was born for
[1:22:00] his time William Branham was born for
[1:22:03] his time but let's not forget that you
[1:22:06] are born for this time
[1:22:10] amen we can go through history but we've
[1:22:14] got to lift the God out of History by
[1:22:17] realizing that you are born for this
[1:22:20] time you were born for this day let's
[1:22:24] refine it a little bit more you are born
[1:22:26] for this hour
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:29] this hour I think it's 8 30. you were
[1:22:32] born for this hour
[1:22:35] this moment
[1:22:39] it doesn't matter how many websites
[1:22:42] people want to put up
[1:22:45] it don't matter how many videos they
[1:22:49] want a place of why I left the message
[1:22:52] what's that got to do with me
[1:22:54] why why do we even spend time listening
[1:22:57] to someone's testimony of why I left the
[1:23:00] message I got no idea no I don't have
[1:23:02] enough time to do what I need to do
[1:23:04] without listening to that
[1:23:06] [Applause]
[1:23:08] I mean I was born for this time it just
[1:23:11] shows that you're not born for this time
[1:23:13] but I was born for this time
[1:23:16] I was born to receive this message I
[1:23:19] born to surrender to the challenges of
[1:23:22] this hour of this word amen
[1:23:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:29] submarine churches
[1:23:31] the prophet of God says
[1:23:34] he says according to Romans 4 16 we find
[1:23:37] that God has given a sure promise to all
[1:23:42] of Abraham's seed amen and Paul puts
[1:23:45] himself and all believers under that
[1:23:49] designation because he says Abraham who
[1:23:53] is the father of us all
[1:23:56] then he goes on to not only narrow down
[1:24:00] his definition but rather to finalize it
[1:24:04] for in Galatians 3 he identified the
[1:24:08] seed singular with Jesus
[1:24:12] and accounted the seed children as
[1:24:16] children of promise and promise as
[1:24:20] having to do with election or the
[1:24:25] choosing of God and that is exactly what
[1:24:29] we have been saying
[1:24:31] these who are of the royal seed are the
[1:24:35] elect of God are the predestinated for
[1:24:40] known of God and were in the mind of God
[1:24:45] and His Thoughts Amen in very plain
[1:24:49] language the true bride of Christ was in
[1:24:53] the mind of God
[1:24:55] eternally though not expressed until
[1:24:59] each came forth in its designated
[1:25:03] decreed season
[1:25:05] right amen this is your season
[1:25:09] this is your time
[1:25:12] amen Eternal attributes of God expressed
[1:25:16] and manifested in flesh this is your
[1:25:19] time this is your season
[1:25:22] as each member came forth it became
[1:25:25] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:25:28] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:25:32] word seed bride
[1:25:36] amen is there anyone here like Abraham
[1:25:39] who can say here am I
[1:25:43] amen that here am I the literal spoken
[1:25:47] word seed bride here am I I'm standing
[1:25:52] in Christ
[1:25:54] with my true identification as here am I
[1:26:00] Lord you called here am I oh my we don't
[1:26:05] respond to a man core we respond to a
[1:26:09] god call amen and God is calling his
[1:26:12] elect and bringing them into a position
[1:26:15] as the spoken word seed bride with their
[1:26:20] true identification here am I
[1:26:24] amen here am I am at both position and
[1:26:30] identification
[1:26:32] amen amen another little thing here
[1:26:36] how did the telescope get to where it
[1:26:39] was meant to get
[1:26:41] it did not get there by its own power
[1:26:48] it has a power the telescope has a power
[1:26:52] within itself
[1:26:54] to correct its position if it gets out
[1:26:58] of position
[1:27:00] I think it might be 26 Rockets
[1:27:04] around it so if it gets spun around or
[1:27:07] moved incorrect into a wrong position it
[1:27:10] can be repositioned
[1:27:12] but it did not come to that position
[1:27:16] by its own strength or buy its own bill
[1:27:19] own ability
[1:27:22] it was carried there
[1:27:25] amen it was carried there
[1:27:28] it was carried in this rocket you can
[1:27:30] see it right up the top there
[1:27:32] it was carried there and then it was by
[1:27:35] by the power of that rocket it was able
[1:27:38] to take its position
[1:27:41] brothers and sisters we we aren't we are
[1:27:43] not self-positioned
[1:27:47] and nor are we self-propelled
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:53] we cannot position ourself
[1:27:57] there's an unseen Force here tonight
[1:28:00] amen amen that that is willing if you're
[1:28:03] not in your position he is here willing
[1:28:06] to position you when you accept the
[1:28:09] Revelation or the invitation I should
[1:28:12] say to come up higher amen yeah and then
[1:28:16] John was not self-propelled
[1:28:19] John was propelled by an unseen Force he
[1:28:23] says behold and I was caught up in the
[1:28:26] spirit
[1:28:28] that what took him there was a
[1:28:30] revelation
[1:28:32] it was a revelation to him
[1:28:34] amen and what is positioned us must be a
[1:28:37] revelation to us amen you don't you
[1:28:40] think my wife of 28 years doesn't know
[1:28:43] who positioned her
[1:28:45] she can point to him God yes she can
[1:28:49] point to him and say he put me there I
[1:28:53] didn't do it he did it I didn't
[1:28:56] self-position myself
[1:28:59] he positioned me and this is what the
[1:29:02] spoken word bride can do is that she has
[1:29:05] a revelation of how she got to where she
[1:29:08] got
[1:29:09] amen she has a revelation of how she got
[1:29:13] to where she got
[1:29:15] amen and this is this it must be a
[1:29:18] revelation to you because if it's not
[1:29:20] then you the devil will be able to
[1:29:22] convince you otherwise that you are
[1:29:24] self-positioned this is why a minister
[1:29:27] must know that he's positioned by God
[1:29:29] otherwise he'll question his his
[1:29:31] ministry constantly and then the people
[1:29:34] will question his ministry as a result
[1:29:36] of him questioning his position amen
[1:29:39] hey man so you've got to know that you
[1:29:42] know
[1:29:43] but brothers and sisters this is not
[1:29:46] something we can reveal to ourself
[1:29:50] amen it's a revelation from God
[1:29:54] that God is the one who caused me to be
[1:29:57] here
[1:29:59] when David went under the battlefield he
[1:30:02] just didn't go under the battlefield
[1:30:04] in his own strength
[1:30:08] the Venom said he waited for the
[1:30:09] rustling in the mulberry tree
[1:30:14] so he was walking out as insignificant
[1:30:17] as he was of that little Ruddy guy
[1:30:20] but he was expressing a confidence
[1:30:24] that Saul couldn't Express
[1:30:27] being Head and Shoulders above him
[1:30:31] David was confident it caused Saul to
[1:30:34] say hey
[1:30:35] whose son is this
[1:30:39] how come he's walking
[1:30:42] with the confidence that he is where is
[1:30:45] he I mean where is he getting that from
[1:30:47] because he knew
[1:30:48] that it couldn't be coming from self
[1:30:51] right because he was just a little
[1:30:53] nothing little righty guy the prophet
[1:30:55] would say but there was a confidence
[1:30:57] that David was expressing
[1:31:00] that came from a hidden power
[1:31:03] that was with David
[1:31:05] the prophet of God said it wasn't David
[1:31:07] who bought Goliath down right
[1:31:11] no it was the hidden power
[1:31:15] that was with David
[1:31:17] that bought Goliath down
[1:31:20] I mean we're not going to bring the
[1:31:22] Goliath down of our age
[1:31:25] no it's it's the hidden power that is
[1:31:28] within you that is going to cause the
[1:31:30] Goliath of your age to be under your
[1:31:33] feet
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:34] amen when you surrender to him he will
[1:31:38] put Satan under your feet it's not you
[1:31:41] putting Satan under your feet he will
[1:31:44] put Satan under your feet when you
[1:31:47] surrender to him
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:52] I want Satan so far under my feet that
[1:31:55] he can't even talk
[1:31:57] yeah I don't want to be standing on his
[1:31:58] foot or you know I know this is like
[1:32:01] symbolic but we understand what I mean
[1:32:03] it me it means that he's under our
[1:32:06] Dominion
[1:32:07] he no longer has dominion over us but we
[1:32:11] have dominion over him you speak when I
[1:32:14] say speak you walk when I say walk you
[1:32:17] sneeze when I say sneeze other than that
[1:32:19] you are under my dominion and you will
[1:32:21] not do anything you have no power over
[1:32:24] me that's where God is going to put
[1:32:27] Satan is under the elect
[1:32:30] feet
[1:32:32] under the spoken word bride's feet
[1:32:36] God has chosen to put Satan
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:47] and we might we might try and make that
[1:32:49] choice ourselves but what you're going
[1:32:51] to find is that
[1:32:53] you know he it's not possible
[1:32:56] you might think you have him and then
[1:32:57] you find out he's over here well he's
[1:32:59] not under your feet if he's over here
[1:33:02] you know what I mean we try to do things
[1:33:05] of our in our own
[1:33:07] strength and sometimes we yeah I did it
[1:33:11] and you find out no you didn't
[1:33:15] no you didn't unless God does it it's
[1:33:17] not done
[1:33:19] amen and if God don't do it no one can
[1:33:22] do it not even you can do it amen
[1:33:25] there's things that God has
[1:33:27] reserved for himself to do
[1:33:30] hey man Abraham could not provide the
[1:33:33] ram
[1:33:34] but he said God will provide for himself
[1:33:37] a sacrifice so he knew that there was
[1:33:40] things reserved for God and only God
[1:33:43] could do those things and in our lives
[1:33:46] we understand God has reserved things
[1:33:48] for himself to do
[1:33:51] in me
[1:33:53] through me
[1:33:55] amen so she's not she she's she's not
[1:33:58] self-positioned but she's positioned by
[1:34:01] God himself
[1:34:04] she's positioned by the power of the
[1:34:07] Holy Ghost
[1:34:08] yes she has no power of her own
[1:34:12] but her power but her power is the same
[1:34:16] power that made it possible for David to
[1:34:19] overcome
[1:34:22] it sounded like a paradox it sounded
[1:34:25] like I tripped over my words but I did
[1:34:27] it
[1:34:28] she has no power of her own but the
[1:34:30] power that she does have is the same
[1:34:33] power that allowed David to take down
[1:34:36] Goliath
[1:34:37] David had no power of his own but the
[1:34:40] power he did have was had enough power
[1:34:42] within itself to overcome and take down
[1:34:45] the Goliath
[1:34:47] amen I am powerless and yet I'm full of
[1:34:50] power
[1:34:54] I'm powerless and yet I'm full of power
[1:34:56] I have no power and yet I'm full of
[1:34:58] power amen why because there's a hidden
[1:35:01] Force
[1:35:02] amen there's something other than you
[1:35:04] here tonight
[1:35:06] amen there's something other than me
[1:35:08] here tonight and that is the Unseen
[1:35:11] force is Jesus Christ in you
[1:35:14] [Applause]
[1:35:16] person of the word
[1:35:22] good
[1:35:26] greater is he
[1:35:29] it is in you
[1:35:32] amen greater is he
[1:35:35] that is in you
[1:35:40] than he that is
[1:35:42] in the world
[1:35:45] amen
[1:35:47] greater is he the power
[1:35:52] it's the Lord
[1:35:55] that's why David's testimony was the
[1:35:57] Lord will deliver you into my hands
[1:35:59] David is saying well I'm I'm going to
[1:36:01] take you down man
[1:36:04] oh David said the Lord will deliver you
[1:36:06] into my hands
[1:36:09] amen it was the two two it was the
[1:36:11] negative and the positive working
[1:36:13] together
[1:36:15] and that greater is he that is in me he
[1:36:18] is the positive I am the negative and
[1:36:21] together creates power
[1:36:25] amen and together
[1:36:27] Satan is taken down
[1:36:30] greater is he greater is he that is in
[1:36:32] you than he that is in the world you
[1:36:34] know Satan is great
[1:36:36] he's powerful
[1:36:38] but greater
[1:36:41] greater
[1:36:43] greater is he
[1:36:45] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:36:48] world what would the scripture is saying
[1:36:50] here is that he that is in you is more
[1:36:53] powerful than he that is in the world
[1:36:55] he is powerful but he that is in you is
[1:36:59] more powerful than he
[1:37:01] he is the greater force there is no
[1:37:04] Force like him on Earth there is no more
[1:37:06] no greater power than him on Earth and
[1:37:09] he happens to be in you
[1:37:12] [Music]

[1:37:19] what you fear and for little Bry
[1:37:24] ant amen let me remind you greater is he
[1:37:28] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:37:30] world
[1:37:32] amen amen here am I
[1:37:37] here am I greater is he that is in me
[1:37:40] that he that is in the world this is a
[1:37:43] revelation you know that greater is he
[1:37:46] that is in me than he that is in the
[1:37:47] world that's a revelation here am I
[1:37:51] amen that that Revelation is calling to
[1:37:53] me and it's calling for a response
[1:37:58] amen oh what would it be like brothers
[1:38:02] if you're speaking to your wife and your
[1:38:03] wife never never talk back
[1:38:07] you had a silent life you know he was
[1:38:09] talking talking you and you you're
[1:38:10] saying all these things but you're
[1:38:12] wanting a response
[1:38:16] I don't have that problem by the way
[1:38:23] my wife loves to hear me talk to her in
[1:38:26] fact she complains when I don't talk
[1:38:27] enough which is pretty often
[1:38:31] but God wants a response yeah amen the
[1:38:35] same as God wanted us response in in
[1:38:37] Genesis 22 1 and Genesis 22 11 God
[1:38:40] wanted a response he was calling
[1:38:45] God wants a response
[1:38:47] because the revelation of the word is
[1:38:49] calling amen
[1:38:51] amen and there's got to be a people who
[1:38:53] rise up
[1:38:54] and say it don't matter what it looked
[1:38:56] like
[1:38:57] it don't matter how great he is it don't
[1:39:00] matter how big his shield is in his
[1:39:02] Spirit etc etc greater is here am I Lord
[1:39:06] foreign
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:14] amen we thank God for the ability to be
[1:39:17] able to respond
[1:39:20] amen because we can't even lay claim to
[1:39:24] that
[1:39:27] God placed the receiver in you
[1:39:31] and a responder
[1:39:34] amen you can receive the word and then
[1:39:37] you can respond to the word
[1:39:40] amen Amen brother this is the the closer
[1:39:45] you get to the Lord the more you realize
[1:39:47] is by Grace I am saying
[1:39:50] amen hallelujah
[1:39:52] amen amen
[1:39:55] Esther was not self-positioned
[1:39:59] her King positioned her
[1:40:02] and this is why when the going got tough
[1:40:05] as we say
[1:40:06] she put on her royal garments
[1:40:12] because she knew she was she was meeting
[1:40:14] a challenge
[1:40:16] a challenge had come up that she knew
[1:40:19] that she couldn't face it by herself
[1:40:24] the Temptation was there
[1:40:27] oh yes it was
[1:40:29] because we are the reality of Esther
[1:40:32] she's she's my shadow
[1:40:34] all right so I know what Esther was
[1:40:36] thinking she was trying to think of a
[1:40:38] way how to deal with the challenge
[1:40:40] that had presented itself in her life
[1:40:43] was she gonna this was her time this
[1:40:46] this was a this this was her time like
[1:40:49] vashti had her time this was her time
[1:40:52] what was she gonna do the challenge
[1:40:54] seemed unreasonable but this was her
[1:40:57] time this was her Proving Ground this is
[1:40:59] where she was going to take another step
[1:41:01] higher from where she was she was going
[1:41:04] to go into the Heavenly places she was
[1:41:06] going to mature even more than what she
[1:41:08] had matured she was going to come to her
[1:41:11] potential by this challenge do not be
[1:41:15] afraid of the challenges that you are
[1:41:17] facing these challenges are designed to
[1:41:20] bring you to your potential to bring you
[1:41:22] to full maturity
[1:41:24] as fathers
[1:41:27] as husbands they don't get caught up in
[1:41:30] the group thing all right to put your
[1:41:32] blinkers on I'm the only one here
[1:41:34] as Fathers as as mothers as wives as
[1:41:38] husbands God is going to bring you the
[1:41:41] full maturity through the challenges
[1:41:43] that you face as a husband
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:47] as a single
[1:41:50] as a widow
[1:41:52] as a grandfather as a grandmother as a
[1:41:56] as a son as a daughter that challenges
[1:41:59] that you face are designed by God Amen
[1:42:03] amen they are allowed by God because
[1:42:07] that challenge is given to you to bring
[1:42:09] you to your potential because you do not
[1:42:12] know your potential
[1:42:15] I do not know my potential as a minister
[1:42:18] but you've ministered yeah but I don't
[1:42:22] know my potential I'm becoming
[1:42:25] and I trust with every meeting that
[1:42:28] every every time I Minister I become
[1:42:30] more
[1:42:31] I become more because I did not know my
[1:42:35] potential one at some point we won't
[1:42:37] have these things we could be preaching
[1:42:40] from prisons
[1:42:42] right we may not have our
[1:42:44] air-conditioned officers we might not
[1:42:46] have a Bible
[1:42:48] we might have nothing
[1:42:50] but we're never without nothing
[1:42:53] because greater is he that is in use and
[1:42:56] he that is in the world
[1:42:58] amen greater is he that is in you than
[1:43:01] he that will take your Bible
[1:43:03] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:43:05] that will that will that will confiscate
[1:43:07] all message material
[1:43:09] oh brother and sister when we get to
[1:43:12] that place we're ready for that place
[1:43:14] don't fear it when we get to that place
[1:43:17] we are ready for that place
[1:43:19] Hallelujah Esther was ready for this
[1:43:22] challenge
[1:43:24] I don't I don't know what I'd do without
[1:43:26] the table program well you're gonna find
[1:43:29] out
[1:43:30] because at some point you're not going
[1:43:32] to have it
[1:43:34] just a flick of a switch
[1:43:36] boom
[1:43:39] I don't think this generation could go
[1:43:41] back to books
[1:43:44] we've had it too easy too long I I
[1:43:47] remember my dad's Concordance
[1:43:50] oh
[1:43:52] Maya am a big heavy thing
[1:43:54] goodness man I don't know how they did
[1:43:57] it did it but I'm glad they did
[1:43:59] because God God made it possible for
[1:44:01] them to be able to search through those
[1:44:03] concordances and now all we do is
[1:44:07] done but soon we're not going to have it
[1:44:10] and we're not going to be able to go
[1:44:11] back to books because we're too
[1:44:13] programmed electronically
[1:44:15] but you are you God is challenging you
[1:44:18] as a father
[1:44:21] God is challenging me as a father
[1:44:24] God is challenging my wife as a mother
[1:44:28] God is challenging my daughter as a
[1:44:31] daughter
[1:44:33] God is challenging my son as a son
[1:44:37] God is challenging me as a husband
[1:44:41] God is challenging my wife as a wife
[1:44:45] because as a husband God wants me to
[1:44:48] come to full maturity
[1:44:51] amen and that can't happen without the
[1:44:54] challenges
[1:44:55] unfortunately
[1:44:57] but as to put on her royal garments what
[1:45:00] was she doing she was testifying of her
[1:45:04] revelation
[1:45:07] it wasn't just a good idea I mean it was
[1:45:09] but it wasn't just a good idea
[1:45:12] it was much more than that
[1:45:15] it was an expression
[1:45:17] of her revelation
[1:45:21] that I did not put myself here
[1:45:24] I did not position myself
[1:45:26] yeah and this is what we need to
[1:45:29] understand as fathers and mothers and
[1:45:31] and wives and husbands I did I am I am
[1:45:33] not self-positioned
[1:45:35] it was god who caused me to become a
[1:45:38] husband it was god who caused me to
[1:45:40] become a father and it is God because
[1:45:42] when I come to that challenge I remember
[1:45:47] who positioned me
[1:45:51] in the offices that I hold
[1:45:53] I cannot meet the challenge myself to be
[1:45:57] the wife to my to be the husband to my
[1:46:00] wife that I need to be it's not possible
[1:46:03] I've tried
[1:46:06] and failed
[1:46:09] and you will too
[1:46:11] because it's not possible
[1:46:14] but what is impossible for man is
[1:46:17] possible for God
[1:46:19] amen it's impossible for me to be the
[1:46:21] father that I need to be to my children
[1:46:23] in the age that I live in without God
[1:46:27] without the Unseen force in my life it
[1:46:30] is not possible for me to be the father
[1:46:32] that I'm ordained to be just as
[1:46:34] impossible as it was for David to take
[1:46:36] down Goliath without the Unseen Force
[1:46:39] without that hidden power in David's
[1:46:42] life it was not possible and it is not
[1:46:44] possible for a wife to be the wife of
[1:46:46] her husband as she ought to be without
[1:46:49] that hidden power in her life
[1:46:51] it's just not possible
[1:46:54] you've got to come to that conclusion
[1:46:56] and that's what you've got to surrender
[1:46:58] to and if you think that you can make it
[1:47:01] without it you're going to find out that
[1:47:03] you can't make it without it and you're
[1:47:04] going to come back to this service and
[1:47:06] think I was told this right amen
[1:47:10] because it is the absolute truth
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:15] it's as much as an absolute as what it
[1:47:18] was without the the message of Elijah
[1:47:21] the revelation of the message of Elijah
[1:47:24] coming to the woman in First Kings 17
[1:47:27] without that Revelation she was going to
[1:47:30] die the same curse
[1:47:33] that the world was gonna die but because
[1:47:35] God sent a message to her and within
[1:47:38] that message had the power to cause her
[1:47:41] to be what she was ordained to be and
[1:47:45] she was ordained to be a mother to her
[1:47:47] son but she could not be it without the
[1:47:50] revelation of the message
[1:47:54] notice now God has put me up on this
[1:47:56] many times I did not say without the
[1:47:58] message
[1:47:59] I said without the revelation of the
[1:48:02] message
[1:48:04] and then without the revelation of the
[1:48:06] message I cannot be to my wife who I'm
[1:48:09] ordained to be
[1:48:11] I cannot be to my daughter who I'm
[1:48:14] ordained to be I cannot be to my church
[1:48:16] who I'm ordained to be without the
[1:48:20] revelation of the word for my day
[1:48:24] the whole revelation of the word the
[1:48:27] book is open
[1:48:28] it is not partially open the book is
[1:48:32] open the Seven Seals have been loosed
[1:48:34] it's the time of fullness not partiality
[1:48:38] but fullness
[1:48:39] the full revelation of the word the
[1:48:43] revelation of the person of Jesus Christ
[1:48:45] in our lives
[1:48:47] amen let's not forget how we got to
[1:48:51] where we got
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:55] you know and yet sometimes we trip
[1:48:57] ourselves up
[1:48:58] sometimes we take credit for things we
[1:49:00] shouldn't take credit for
[1:49:03] as a pastor sometimes you take credit
[1:49:05] for things you shouldn't take credit for
[1:49:08] as a husband as a father etc etc
[1:49:12] you've got to realize I had nothing to
[1:49:14] do with this
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:17] it's not it's not me
[1:49:20] it's that this is this is the this is
[1:49:22] the problem that Israel had
[1:49:24] because they sung a song to David
[1:49:28] Saul had killed his thousands was it and
[1:49:30] David his tens of thousands
[1:49:34] missed it
[1:49:37] missed it wasn't David
[1:49:41] it was a hidden Force
[1:49:43] there was a hidden power
[1:49:46] amen and the moment we bring credit to
[1:49:48] ourself
[1:49:49] well God won't share his glory with
[1:49:51] anyone
[1:49:53] you know he he he he
[1:49:55] um practices his own word
[1:49:58] he does
[1:50:00] he spoiled the rodents spare the spare
[1:50:03] the rod spoil the child yeah
[1:50:05] well he applies that to me
[1:50:08] he applies that scripture to my life
[1:50:11] I mean sometimes we need a little bit of
[1:50:13] a touch-up you know
[1:50:15] a little bit of putting in line
[1:50:19] you know job did the same thing
[1:50:23] he began to give himself credit
[1:50:27] but God sent a messenger called Eli
[1:50:30] and God spoke through that man that's
[1:50:32] why it's good for ministers to be
[1:50:34] ministered to
[1:50:36] and I speak sorry Brothers it's good for
[1:50:40] this minister
[1:50:42] to be ministered to because sometimes
[1:50:45] this Minister needs realigning
[1:50:48] and sometimes God will use a minister in
[1:50:52] our own Fellowship to okay Lord you're
[1:50:55] speaking to me
[1:50:56] thank you
[1:50:58] thank you
[1:51:01] amen
[1:51:03] so now what was the purpose of this
[1:51:07] this was sent there for a particular
[1:51:09] purpose and it was designed to for a
[1:51:12] particular purpose remembering that it
[1:51:15] was also sent to take a certain position
[1:51:20] and in that position it was going to
[1:51:22] accomplish its purpose
[1:51:25] outside of that position it was not
[1:51:27] going to accomplish its purpose
[1:51:29] so it had to be in its particular
[1:51:32] position in order to accomplish its
[1:51:35] purpose Brethren talks about how the the
[1:51:38] tribes when they went over into Israel
[1:51:41] that they they had a designated position
[1:51:43] that they had to take
[1:51:44] he said Ephraim couldn't raise corn in
[1:51:47] manasseh's corner
[1:51:49] he had to stay within the boundary
[1:51:51] that God had given Ephraim had to stay
[1:51:55] in the boundary that God had given
[1:51:56] Ephraim NASA had to stay in the boundary
[1:51:59] within the boundaries that God had given
[1:52:01] her given given them so we understand
[1:52:04] that we we have a particular position
[1:52:06] that God has given us and God wants to
[1:52:09] accomplish certain things through Us in
[1:52:12] that position
[1:52:13] right right but we've got to be sure
[1:52:15] that we're staying in our position this
[1:52:18] will this will here's a few slides of
[1:52:21] what this telescope
[1:52:24] um has the pictures that it's taken
[1:52:29] quite amazing
[1:52:36] so what man has done here
[1:52:39] he's captured pictures
[1:52:42] through this instrument
[1:52:46] and bought the pictures
[1:52:50] down to earth so that we can see them
[1:52:56] they've captured the Unseen
[1:53:00] because these cannot be seen
[1:53:04] by the natural eye
[1:53:07] otherwise 10 billion dollars is wasted
[1:53:11] all right so this instrument was
[1:53:14] designed on a natural level to catch the
[1:53:18] Unseen
[1:53:20] and bring the Unseen to Earth
[1:53:25] so the thing that was unseen can be seen
[1:53:31] all right and this is why this is this
[1:53:33] is amazing because what man is achieving
[1:53:37] is only a reflection
[1:53:41] it's only a portion of what God has done
[1:53:45] yeah
[1:53:46] amen because God God operates and man
[1:53:50] follows
[1:53:52] man doesn't follow and God operate man
[1:53:55] doesn't man doesn't go ahead of God and
[1:53:57] God follows man no man is following the
[1:54:00] progression of God
[1:54:02] man is following the condescending of
[1:54:05] God is what man is following
[1:54:08] amen so for the first time
[1:54:12] in the the history of this Earth
[1:54:17] we are able to see things
[1:54:20] that have never been seen
[1:54:25] wow I find this astonishing I love this
[1:54:30] stuff as someone who did year 10 twice
[1:54:33] and failed both times I love this stuff
[1:54:40] okay
[1:54:41] if you go outside tonight in the
[1:54:45] darkness of night you won't see
[1:54:48] this image
[1:54:53] because these images cannot be seen
[1:54:58] in their natural position
[1:55:01] by the natural eye
[1:55:06] it takes an instrument
[1:55:09] to reveal the invisible things of God
[1:55:16] so what we can say here is that men
[1:55:21] is fellowshipping with a mystery
[1:55:26] natural man is fellowshipping with a
[1:55:29] natural mystery
[1:55:31] that they are studying the mystery
[1:55:36] right this this this mystery has an
[1:55:40] immense amount of detail
[1:55:43] and you can never come to the end of
[1:55:47] this mystery if you look them up on your
[1:55:50] screen at home on a high definition uh
[1:55:52] screen you can study that you can study
[1:55:56] one image
[1:55:57] for hours on end
[1:56:00] and come back later and find a place
[1:56:03] that you hadn't seen before
[1:56:06] yeah all right so so man is bringing has
[1:56:09] has made up God has made it possible for
[1:56:12] man to bring the things in a in a
[1:56:15] natural life that are invisible down to
[1:56:18] us
[1:56:20] so that they can see we can sit
[1:56:24] so what was in the heavens
[1:56:28] God has made it possible for man to
[1:56:30] bring to the Earth
[1:56:33] and see what was a mystery
[1:56:37] is now revealed to whoever wants to look
[1:56:40] at it
[1:56:44] amen
[1:56:47] what we are seeing here
[1:56:51] are the thoughts of God
[1:56:53] that was spoken in Genesis 1.
[1:57:00] it just keeps getting better
[1:57:03] this is the thoughts of God
[1:57:07] expressed
[1:57:09] the thoughts of God that went from
[1:57:11] thought to word to manifestation
[1:57:15] we are looking at the manifestation of
[1:57:18] the thoughts of God
[1:57:20] we are fellowshipping with the
[1:57:23] manifestation of the thoughts of God
[1:57:26] because now we can see it you can't have
[1:57:28] fellowship with something you can't see
[1:57:30] but when you can see something you can
[1:57:33] have fellowship with something
[1:57:36] this has a message
[1:57:39] it is a message
[1:57:41] it's telling you that there's an unseen
[1:57:44] Force
[1:57:46] and it ain't the Big Bang Theory or
[1:57:48] whatever other Theory but it's a god
[1:57:50] it's God and God said let there be that
[1:57:55] was an unseen force that was Elohim
[1:57:58] existing by himself let there be and
[1:58:01] there was
[1:58:02] is testifying that it had a creator
[1:58:07] because the creation must have a Creator
[1:58:10] amen so it's testifying that there is
[1:58:13] someone greater than me
[1:58:17] there's an unseen Force
[1:58:22] one of the brothers in the fellowship at
[1:58:24] home said it it looks like chaos
[1:58:29] but the best that we can describe it he
[1:58:31] said is Controlled Chaos
[1:58:34] because every Star was positionally
[1:58:37] placed
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:39] amen so because there was an instrument
[1:58:42] sent
[1:58:43] what that instrument did was it revealed
[1:58:46] things that were positionally placed
[1:58:49] amen we thank God for this
[1:58:52] amen we thank God for this we ask we are
[1:58:56] seeing the thoughts of God
[1:58:59] amen
[1:59:00] when they saw them
[1:59:04] they did not become material
[1:59:08] but they saw
[1:59:11] what was material
[1:59:14] the same as when Abraham walked to the
[1:59:17] mountain that God had chosen when he saw
[1:59:20] it it didn't come become material it was
[1:59:23] already there because it was created in
[1:59:25] Genesis 1.
[1:59:29] wonderful
[1:59:37] they were all they were there all the
[1:59:39] time just undiscovered
[1:59:42] the Mysteries that being there all the
[1:59:45] time
[1:59:46] just not seen
[1:59:49] amen the mystery was there all the time
[1:59:52] just not seen
[1:59:57] but God has allowed man to see further
[2:00:01] than he ever has
[2:00:04] God has allowed man to see
[2:00:07] the mystery to a depth
[2:00:11] that they never had
[2:00:14] so let's think about this this means
[2:00:16] that man
[2:00:18] is maturing
[2:00:20] in his revelation
[2:00:22] of the existing mystery
[2:00:26] does this sound like anyone else
[2:00:32] man is maturing in his revelation of the
[2:00:37] mystery
[2:00:39] I mean you can go to videos where they
[2:00:41] uh YouTube video where they broadcast
[2:00:44] these first images and they're just
[2:00:47] ecstatic
[2:00:48] thank you this is clapping and cheering
[2:00:51] and we have done this and we have done
[2:00:52] that and Hallelujah yeah they're up in
[2:00:54] class I mean it looks like a church
[2:00:56] service
[2:00:58] but from a different angle because
[2:01:00] they're praising themselves
[2:01:03] amen
[2:01:05] so now if you if you look at this Bible
[2:01:10] God allows you to see certain things
[2:01:12] within this
[2:01:14] with your natural eye
[2:01:18] because this is the first first Bible
[2:01:22] and so that there was a mystery element
[2:01:24] to the first Bible
[2:01:26] there was things that could be seen by
[2:01:28] the natural eye but there was things
[2:01:29] that couldn't be seen by the natural eye
[2:01:31] so if you look at this you can see a
[2:01:34] certain amount of this by the natural
[2:01:36] eye
[2:01:38] all right but there's also parts of this
[2:01:42] Bible that you can't see
[2:01:45] you can't see parts of this Bible by the
[2:01:49] natural eye
[2:01:51] all right it's just not possible so that
[2:01:53] means that this book that has been
[2:01:55] around for a long time there's a mystery
[2:01:58] element to this amen and the Mystery
[2:02:01] element to this book is not or is is not
[2:02:06] everyone's not ordained to see it
[2:02:12] there's there's only
[2:02:14] I don't yeah here I go again see
[2:02:20] if this offends you I'm sorry
[2:02:23] but I'm not because it's the truth
[2:02:28] there is only a certain group
[2:02:31] yes
[2:02:32] that is ordained to see
[2:02:35] the mystery element
[2:02:38] within this book
[2:02:41] but you alone
[2:02:45] cannot see it
[2:02:48] without God sending an instrument
[2:02:52] to this age
[2:02:54] to reveal the mystery that is contained
[2:02:58] within this book
[2:03:02] that instrument is called William
[2:03:05] Branham
[2:03:06] and I ain't afraid to say it and I ain't
[2:03:10] ashamed to say it the instrument
[2:03:14] was William Branham
[2:03:17] amen the instrument
[2:03:20] was not the one who revealed the ins the
[2:03:24] the mystery it was God
[2:03:28] who revealed the mystery to the
[2:03:31] instrument
[2:03:32] and the instrument then revealed the
[2:03:35] contents of this book or spoke the
[2:03:39] contents the mystery content of this
[2:03:41] book to the elect
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:47] yes sir can't you see why I'm happy
[2:03:50] [Applause]
[2:03:52] I've accepted the mystery content
[2:03:57] I see the mystery content
[2:04:00] I am fellowshipping
[2:04:03] with the mystery content
[2:04:07] because the mystery content is not a
[2:04:10] theology it's a passion
[2:04:14] amen it's the person of the word
[2:04:17] [Applause]
[2:04:20] my don't you love how the word just
[2:04:23] keeps getting better and better
[2:04:25] every time you preach something it just
[2:04:27] gets better it never gets old it's not
[2:04:29] like stale bread not fresh bread goes
[2:04:31] stale God's word never goes stale it
[2:04:34] just it keeps getting better
[2:04:37] oh my we thank God Amen God through a
[2:04:41] prophet instrument
[2:04:43] has revealed the contents of this book
[2:04:49] he has bought
[2:04:52] what was in the heavens
[2:04:56] and revealed it to be on earth
[2:05:02] because this is God in print form
[2:05:07] amen but what God did through that
[2:05:11] instrument
[2:05:12] to reveal that the print form has taken
[2:05:16] on flesh form
[2:05:18] [Applause]
[2:05:19] amen the print of the word has taken on
[2:05:23] flesh the word has become flesh
[2:05:27] amen and that this remembering that this
[2:05:31] word was once the thoughts of God which
[2:05:34] was in the heaven so God condescending
[2:05:38] God coming down God unveiling himself
[2:05:41] God condescending stage by stage in his
[2:05:44] in his divine order
[2:05:47] amen from thought to word to flesh that
[2:05:50] is divine order it's not thought from
[2:05:53] from thought to this to that it's from
[2:05:55] thought to word to flesh amen God's
[2:05:59] divine order has revealed that what was
[2:06:02] in the heavens I'll say that different
[2:06:04] way who was in the heavens is on Earth
[2:06:07] yeah
[2:06:09] now it doesn't end there
[2:06:13] because there's a part of you
[2:06:17] like this book
[2:06:19] that cannot be seen
[2:06:22] by the natural eye
[2:06:27] so the only way that God was going to
[2:06:30] reveal the Unseen portion of him was
[2:06:35] according to his Bible order
[2:06:38] people don't like Bible order
[2:06:42] but God has order
[2:06:45] God is not a god of confusion he just
[2:06:48] doesn't say well one day you'll get to
[2:06:50] know me no he has a way
[2:06:52] amen God God reveals the secrets his
[2:06:56] secrets to the prophet first
[2:07:03] but it's not his desire it's not God's
[2:07:06] desire for the revelation of the mystery
[2:07:08] to remain with the prophet
[2:07:10] no would I no it ain't he wants the
[2:07:14] mystery to be a revelation to itself
[2:07:18] he doesn't want you relying upon I hope
[2:07:20] this is okay he doesn't want you relying
[2:07:23] upon the prophet's revelation of the
[2:07:25] mystery he wants you to have your own
[2:07:27] revelation of the mystery this is his
[2:07:30] desire for you
[2:07:32] this is his desire for me there's an
[2:07:36] unseen portion there's a part of you
[2:07:38] that you cannot see
[2:07:42] you've never seen the real me and to be
[2:07:45] honest I've never seen the real me
[2:07:49] but faith
[2:07:51] testifies
[2:07:53] of the Unseen
[2:07:55] amen if Faith testify is that the Unseen
[2:07:59] is there
[2:08:01] it's a reality to be
[2:08:03] I see it
[2:08:05] but not with these
[2:08:07] but with the eye of the heart
[2:08:11] who is I believe it was job said I have
[2:08:13] heard of thee with my ear
[2:08:16] but he said now I see thee with mine I
[2:08:22] that eye of faith
[2:08:25] not these
[2:08:28] the eye of faith
[2:08:35] God has given
[2:08:37] you
[2:08:39] to see something someone
[2:08:44] that not everyone can see
[2:08:48] because the mystery remains a mystery to
[2:08:52] some it remains a secret to some but
[2:08:55] it's revealed to others
[2:08:59] God's desire for you
[2:09:02] is to reveal the mystery to you amen
[2:09:07] God does not want to keep you in bondage
[2:09:11] he wants you to be free
[2:09:15] amen he wants you to be free and the
[2:09:19] truth will set you free
[2:09:22] I mean there's power in the truth
[2:09:25] but the truth is a person
[2:09:28] I am the way the truth and the life
[2:09:31] it's not a theological understanding
[2:09:33] it's a person he's the truth will set
[2:09:36] you free
[2:09:37] amen and that's why when you can see him
[2:09:40] you'll be free
[2:09:41] [Applause]
[2:09:45] amen he sets me free
[2:09:49] man amen
[2:09:51] his desire for you is to be known
[2:09:54] as you are known
[2:09:57] you think God didn't know about this
[2:10:00] because he did you didn't think God
[2:10:03] didn't know about the mysteries in this
[2:10:05] book he knew the mysteries in this book
[2:10:08] and he knows the mystery element of you
[2:10:11] but he wants you to know you he wants
[2:10:14] you to know you as you are known he
[2:10:16] wants you to be known as you are known
[2:10:18] this is his desire for you
[2:10:21] this is why a husband a groom Whispers
[2:10:24] The oh darling you're beautiful you're
[2:10:26] magnificent you're you're everything I
[2:10:28] ever dreamed of you're just you're
[2:10:31] you're I haven't got words to tell you
[2:10:35] right he once said and know that
[2:10:40] he wants her to be known
[2:10:44] as she is known
[2:10:48] but if she continues to reject his word
[2:10:53] nothing's going to change
[2:10:55] I think I said this the other night a
[2:10:58] woman will only find satisfaction in the
[2:11:01] words of a husband amen because it's a
[2:11:03] type of the Christ and his bride the
[2:11:06] only place this bride will find
[2:11:08] satisfaction is in the words of of
[2:11:12] Christ
[2:11:17] president married there's two people
[2:11:19] one of them lived in a in a box car and
[2:11:22] the other one in a palace
[2:11:24] one was the one in the palace was
[2:11:26] arguing
[2:11:27] the one in the the one in the Box Car
[2:11:29] was sitting on his lap saying it's okay
[2:11:32] darling
[2:11:33] what was the difference here there's
[2:11:35] some there was got to be some form of
[2:11:37] difference
[2:11:39] you know brothers and sisters we're not
[2:11:41] like other churches
[2:11:43] if there's not a difference we have an
[2:11:46] issue
[2:11:47] I don't say that to to run down brother
[2:11:51] Chad there is a difference
[2:11:54] if if in my church there's not a
[2:11:56] difference in my church to the
[2:11:57] denominational Church something's wrong
[2:12:00] something's wrong because she has the
[2:12:02] words of life
[2:12:04] she has the words of eternal life
[2:12:07] there's got to be something different
[2:12:09] and God causes you to be different
[2:12:13] God wants you to be different this is
[2:12:15] why uh uh
[2:12:18] this is why your wife should be
[2:12:21] different to any other wife
[2:12:24] if your wife looks like any other wife
[2:12:27] then you have an issue
[2:12:29] [Music]
[2:12:30] I hope this isn't bad but husbands
[2:12:33] you're probably not doing your job if
[2:12:35] that's the case
[2:12:37] there's got to be in it there's got to
[2:12:39] be a difference
[2:12:41] because God is condescending to a level
[2:12:45] that we are not looking at God in a
[2:12:47] prophet
[2:12:48] that I'm sorry but I am not looking for
[2:12:52] God in a prophet because God has
[2:12:55] condescended I saw God in a prophet but
[2:12:59] he's condescended further than that to
[2:13:03] where now God is in me
[2:13:04] [Music]
[2:13:06] and I see God in Me
[2:13:10] because he is doing what I couldn't do
[2:13:13] he is doing the impossible
[2:13:17] hey
[2:13:19] hey amen
[2:13:22] amen it causes a a level of
[2:13:25] responsibility like we've never had
[2:13:27] before because once upon a time we could
[2:13:29] profit you just stay in line
[2:13:31] you stay in line and I'll be okay
[2:13:34] you know but in the in the in this day
[2:13:37] I've got to stay in line
[2:13:39] amen because this is the vessel that God
[2:13:42] is working through this is the father
[2:13:44] that God is working through God
[2:13:47] God is my children's father
[2:13:54] was William Branham your Prophet or was
[2:13:57] God your prophet
[2:14:00] it was God in William Brown
[2:14:03] it's God in you
[2:14:06] was it David who took down Goliath or
[2:14:09] was it was it God in David that took
[2:14:12] down Goliath when David come home for a
[2:14:15] battle and the the amalekites was it had
[2:14:17] taken all his wife and children was it
[2:14:20] David who went and got him back or was
[2:14:22] it God in David that went and got him
[2:14:24] back
[2:14:27] amen God condescending
[2:14:31] to a level that we've never seen
[2:14:36] we've never seen two now
[2:14:41] the mystery element
[2:14:43] of you
[2:14:45] the eternal
[2:14:47] element
[2:14:49] is the mystery
[2:14:51] element
[2:14:53] but the mystery element
[2:14:56] is not a mystery to me
[2:15:02] do you know why
[2:15:04] it's not a theology
[2:15:07] it's not a theory
[2:15:10] it's because I see him work
[2:15:13] it's because I see him do
[2:15:16] these signs shall follow them that
[2:15:19] belief
[2:15:20] I see him
[2:15:22] by the very things that he is doing I
[2:15:25] see him expressing himself
[2:15:27] I see him do something can I say I could
[2:15:29] have never done that exactly
[2:15:32] that's exactly the price that he wants
[2:15:34] you to be because that is the Revelation
[2:15:36] the same Revelation that Esther had when
[2:15:39] she walked into that Holy that that
[2:15:41] judge that place that she was she had to
[2:15:44] push through that curtain and go into
[2:15:45] that place she knew that she couldn't do
[2:15:48] it there had to be someone else there
[2:15:51] had to be someone greater
[2:15:53] praise God she didn't do it in his her
[2:15:57] power she did it it was his power
[2:15:59] working through her
[2:16:06] amen
[2:16:09] I didn't know whether I'd have enough
[2:16:10] tonight
[2:16:12] but now I'm wondering whether I got too
[2:16:14] much
[2:16:16] amen
[2:16:18] it's your fault right brother Chad
[2:16:20] the first hour was mine the second one's
[2:16:22] yours
[2:16:25] amen
[2:16:29] amen God desires you
[2:16:33] to be a revelation to yourself amen
[2:16:37] he desires you to be known
[2:16:42] as you unknown
[2:16:45] when Abraham said here am I
[2:16:49] he was not drawing attention to God
[2:16:55] it wasn't the fact that Abraham God
[2:16:59] didn't know where Abraham was
[2:17:02] he was speaking of a revelation
[2:17:07] Abraham Abraham
[2:17:11] here am I Lord
[2:17:15] he was speaking by revelation
[2:17:19] when God calls you
[2:17:23] you respond by the revelation
[2:17:27] that he has given you of yourself
[2:17:32] when I speak darling
[2:17:36] that's that's who she is to me right
[2:17:39] well that that is a revelation to her
[2:17:43] so she responds
[2:17:45] as a result of that revelation
[2:17:49] if I say that to someone else another
[2:17:51] man's wife well kick me out of the
[2:17:53] church to start with
[2:17:55] but she's not going to respond
[2:17:58] right because that word
[2:18:01] that I spoke is not a REV is not the
[2:18:04] revelation of her
[2:18:06] right but but be but when the word comes
[2:18:10] in contact
[2:18:11] with who is it it is ordained to come in
[2:18:15] contact with
[2:18:16] there's a response
[2:18:20] she can be walking the complete other
[2:18:23] direction and it'll cause her to turn
[2:18:27] why what she hasn't said a word but
[2:18:30] she's responding to my words so when God
[2:18:34] said Abraham Abraham Abraham responded
[2:18:39] to that word because that name was a
[2:18:43] revelation to him
[2:18:44] [Music]
[2:18:48] the name his name was a revelation to
[2:18:52] him
[2:18:53] he
[2:18:54] if God had said Abram
[2:18:58] he wouldn't have responded
[2:19:01] but God gave Abraham a new name God gave
[2:19:06] Abram a new name he gave him a part of
[2:19:09] his own name so Abraham responded to his
[2:19:14] new identification as Abraham not Abram
[2:19:19] he was no longer associated with Abram
[2:19:22] now he was Abraham
[2:19:26] oh my God has given you a new name
[2:19:31] amen God has given you a new name that
[2:19:34] new name is the name of the mystery
[2:19:37] element of you
[2:19:39] amen
[2:19:41] amen that name is the name of the
[2:19:44] mystery element of you
[2:19:47] but the mystery element of you is not a
[2:19:50] mystery to you
[2:19:52] that's why you respond to that name
[2:19:57] you respond to the name of Mrs Jesus
[2:20:00] Christ
[2:20:01] because that is your new name
[2:20:04] that's the mystery element that causes
[2:20:07] this body to spin around and say yes
[2:20:10] Lord
[2:20:13] it's the word of uh of the groom
[2:20:17] coming to the wife and the wife
[2:20:20] responding to the word of the groom
[2:20:24] there's no word
[2:20:27] that your wife will respond to like
[2:20:30] yours
[2:20:32] husbands there's no word that your wife
[2:20:36] will respond to like your word
[2:20:42] why because she is a part of you
[2:20:46] she she is a part of the revelation of
[2:20:49] you
[2:20:51] with with without her you're not
[2:20:53] complete
[2:20:54] together you've got together you are a
[2:20:58] complete revelation
[2:20:59] you alone that's why when a man's
[2:21:02] looking for a wife he's looking for a
[2:21:04] part of himself
[2:21:05] he's looking for a mystery part of
[2:21:07] himself
[2:21:08] but but when he finds that mystery part
[2:21:11] and God I say God brings them together
[2:21:16] uh now you have a complete revelation of
[2:21:19] him
[2:21:21] because she is a REV she is a part of
[2:21:24] him
[2:21:26] amen amen
[2:21:28] God desires you to be known God wants
[2:21:31] you to be known
[2:21:32] this was astounding I I was studying the
[2:21:35] I took a series at home on the
[2:21:37] Masterpiece family
[2:21:38] and uh I was just in my office and I was
[2:21:42] I've been looking at at this um
[2:21:45] what they'd been achieving here through
[2:21:47] this James Wood telescope
[2:21:49] and I I had a thought come to me which
[2:21:52] I'm not going to claim as my own
[2:21:54] that said I I wonder if anyone has said
[2:21:58] anything
[2:21:59] about
[2:22:00] in relation to these images of being a
[2:22:03] masterpiece
[2:22:06] so I put in James Webb tell us Google
[2:22:08] James Webb Telescope masterpiece
[2:22:11] well this is what it came up with
[2:22:14] associate professor Jane Eldridge head
[2:22:16] of the Department of physics University
[2:22:17] of Queensland comments the jwst which is
[2:22:21] the James Webb Space Telescope now needs
[2:22:26] to be called
[2:22:28] just the wow telescope
[2:22:31] these new images are of views we've seen
[2:22:35] before
[2:22:36] but with the clarity and detail we now
[2:22:41] see it feels like a masterpiece has been
[2:22:46] restored to our full View
[2:22:52] if you don't believe me There's the link
[2:22:58] it feels like a masterpiece has been
[2:23:03] restored
[2:23:04] to our full View
[2:23:09] it's more the more than being a
[2:23:12] masterpiece
[2:23:13] remembering that the first message
[2:23:15] brother and preached on Masterpiece was
[2:23:18] called Masterpiece
[2:23:19] the second one was called the identified
[2:23:23] Masterpiece so it was more than just an
[2:23:27] understanding that there was a
[2:23:28] masterpiece but now the Masterpiece had
[2:23:31] been restored to our full View
[2:23:36] amen now if that's what God is doing
[2:23:39] because I agree I these images they're a
[2:23:42] masterpiece
[2:23:43] they really are they are a work of a
[2:23:46] monster Craftsman who create has created
[2:23:48] a masterpiece and that's what that's
[2:23:50] what these are they're nothing more
[2:23:52] nothing less it's just masterful but if
[2:23:55] that's what God has done on a human
[2:23:57] level
[2:23:58] on a natural level
[2:24:01] then that only testifies what God has
[2:24:04] done on a spiritual level that there is
[2:24:08] now a masterpiece who has been restored
[2:24:13] to our full View

[2:29:01] revelation of the masterpiece
[2:29:05] yes sir she doesn't have to have
[2:29:07] confidence in herself she has her
[2:29:09] confidence needs to be in me
[2:29:12] because I am her head
[2:29:14] and her confidence needs to be in a
[2:29:17] headship
[2:29:18] right so she can walk into a into a into
[2:29:22] a shopping mall with a with a card
[2:29:26] that I've given her
[2:29:28] that has the power within it to purchase
[2:29:31] anything she wants
[2:29:33] and someone can walk in front of her and
[2:29:35] say excuse me I I don't think this is
[2:29:38] your caliber of shop
[2:29:41] and she can say well
[2:29:43] you better step aside the problem with
[2:29:46] you is that you don't see the mystery
[2:29:48] element you're only looking at the
[2:29:50] outside you're only looking at the flesh
[2:29:52] you better step aside because my husband
[2:29:55] has given me the authority to purchase
[2:29:58] anything that I desire
[2:30:00] foreign
[2:30:03] God's Masterpiece is responding to the
[2:30:07] voice of the masterpiece
[2:30:10] amen the gods Masterpiece she is
[2:30:13] responding to him the same way that
[2:30:16] Abraham responded to Abraham Abraham
[2:30:21] here am I
[2:30:24] here am I positionally here am I Lord I
[2:30:31] am a revelation of you amen amen
[2:30:36] amen I am a part of you
[2:30:42] as a father
[2:30:44] as a husband
[2:30:47] where am I going to get the confidence
[2:30:49] from
[2:30:50] to meet the challenges
[2:30:54] that fatherhood
[2:30:56] and husbandship
[2:30:58] has in this hour
[2:31:01] how could I as a father
[2:31:04] outdo
[2:31:06] technology
[2:31:08] because I'm not technical
[2:31:12] I don't change
[2:31:14] pictures
[2:31:16] every 30 seconds
[2:31:22] I'm just this boring old dad
[2:31:27] but it doesn't matter it shouldn't
[2:31:29] matter
[2:31:31] how great
[2:31:33] technology becomes
[2:31:39] the mystery element of me
[2:31:43] should be able to outdo
[2:31:47] anything
[2:31:48] that this world
[2:31:50] can produce
[2:31:54] I believe it
[2:31:56] and this is challenging
[2:31:59] but I believe it
[2:32:00] but if you ain't challenged how you
[2:32:03] cannot how you're going to reach your
[2:32:04] potential
[2:32:06] if you ain't challenged as a father how
[2:32:09] are you going to reach your potential as
[2:32:10] a father if you ain't challenged as a
[2:32:12] husband how are you going to reach your
[2:32:13] potential as a husband
[2:32:15] right
[2:32:16] that's right
[2:32:18] what are we going to do just wait for
[2:32:20] the rapture
[2:32:23] no
[2:32:24] you fulfilling your purpose will bring
[2:32:27] the Rapture down
[2:32:29] you will cause the Rapture when you've
[2:32:33] come to your potential
[2:32:35] we don't come to potential after the
[2:32:38] Rapture
[2:32:39] right we come to protect the coming to
[2:32:42] our potential brings the Rapture down
[2:32:46] Abraham Enoch walked with God and was
[2:32:50] not
[2:32:51] [Music]
[2:32:54] his walk with God caused Enoch to be
[2:32:58] raptured
[2:33:00] because Enoch reached his potential by
[2:33:03] Walking with God
[2:33:05] amen and how how are we how
[2:33:09] are we going to be raptured
[2:33:14] by coming to our potential
[2:33:17] through a challenge
[2:33:19] by being challenged
[2:33:21] challenged his mother's sons
[2:33:25] daughters
[2:33:27] widows grandmothers grandfathers coming
[2:33:30] to our potential in the office
[2:33:34] that God or officers
[2:33:36] you can't choose one
[2:33:38] I'm a son I'm a father I'm a husband
[2:33:42] I'm an and I'm a grandfather
[2:33:45] I haven't done that one very many times
[2:33:47] and I'm a grand I've got to come to my
[2:33:49] potential
[2:33:52] in those offices
[2:33:55] amen
[2:33:56] we'll get there tomorrow
[2:34:04] God doesn't want you to presume I've got
[2:34:06] to bring this to a close
[2:34:10] God wants
[2:34:12] God Wants You to Know Who You Are
[2:34:16] if we're presuming
[2:34:19] then the fruit of the it'll yield that
[2:34:23] type of fruit
[2:34:25] as a if I'm presuming who I am
[2:34:29] in my office
[2:34:31] it'll produce that type of fruit
[2:34:35] if I know who I am
[2:34:38] because I believe
[2:34:40] that as
[2:34:42] Jesus knew who he was
[2:34:45] two thousand year ago
[2:34:48] the only way that he could fulfill
[2:34:52] what he was ordained to fulfill
[2:34:56] his purpose was through the revelation
[2:34:59] of who he was
[2:35:01] it wasn't enough for John to have the
[2:35:04] revelation behold the lamb of God
[2:35:07] Jesus had to have that same revelation
[2:35:12] and he stood before Pilate said for this
[2:35:14] reason came I into the world for this
[2:35:16] purp for this end of my born
[2:35:18] he knew who he was
[2:35:21] and in order for us to be successful
[2:35:25] in the offices
[2:35:27] that we hold we must
[2:35:29] know who we are
[2:35:33] amen we are not I don't I'm not saying
[2:35:37] that in a fearful way
[2:35:39] have faith
[2:35:41] believe believe in God he he will it's
[2:35:45] up to him he will reveal it
[2:35:47] amen and this is why
[2:35:50] this is why he as he reveals it
[2:35:54] we as husbands are able God opens his
[2:35:58] word
[2:35:59] husband's rights
[2:36:01] God opens his word husbands rise
[2:36:04] this is why and I hope this is okay
[2:36:06] those who don't believe the seventh seal
[2:36:08] is open they're not going to come to
[2:36:10] their potential right
[2:36:12] because all the book must be open
[2:36:16] in order for you to become to maturity
[2:36:19] if the if you believe that the book is
[2:36:21] not open that is the level of maturity
[2:36:23] that you will come to and I know that's
[2:36:25] hard it's it's hard to accept and it's
[2:36:27] hard to understand but it is the truth
[2:36:30] I don't mean it's hard to understand I
[2:36:32] mean sometimes it's hard to say
[2:36:34] but it's the truth
[2:36:36] yeah it's the truth the only way is to
[2:36:38] is through the opening of the word I'm
[2:36:42] going to close with this quote here
[2:36:45] from statue of a perfect man
[2:36:50] through through that blood we are
[2:36:52] cleansed and now our blood our life
[2:36:54] which came by living through sexual
[2:36:58] desire
[2:36:59] brought our life in the world the blood
[2:37:02] of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our
[2:37:05] Nature by sending upon us the Holy
[2:37:08] Spirit
[2:37:09] then we become into the divine nature of
[2:37:13] God then we become a Dwelling Place
[2:37:17] for God
[2:37:19] Jesus said at that day you know that I
[2:37:23] am in the father and the father in me
[2:37:26] and I I in you and you in me
[2:37:30] that's thus saith the Lord
[2:37:34] you will know
[2:37:36] amen you will know
[2:37:39] amen that that that you
[2:37:42] is the mystery element

[2:37:53] book will be will will this apply does

[2:38:22] the place of Christ
[2:38:25] carrying on his ministry
[2:38:27] he that believeth on me the works that I
[2:38:32] do shall he do also
[2:38:34] yet a little while the world seeth me no
[2:38:38] more yet ye shall see me
[2:38:42] for I will be with you even
[2:38:46] in you

[2:45:57] and the back part of his mind has been
[2:45:59] revealed in this day and and how
[2:46:01] precious it is that God has ordained
[2:46:03] human lips to speak it in humans ears to
[2:46:05] hear it and then a real set of ears in
