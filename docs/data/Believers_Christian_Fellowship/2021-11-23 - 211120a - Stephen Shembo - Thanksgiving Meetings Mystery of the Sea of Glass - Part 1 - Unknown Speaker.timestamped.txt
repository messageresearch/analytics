[8:50] this is home
[8:51] amen
[8:53] your church plays in my house almost
[8:55] every day
[8:58] i usually don't have time to watch it
[8:59] but my wife
[9:01] watches back and forth back and forth
[9:03] and before you know it she looked at me
[9:05] like this is scary
[9:09] i say why is it scary he said you keep
[9:11] preaching the same thing you ain't
[9:12] brought the child
[9:16] amen and i'm like we we have not even
[9:19] talked for a while
[9:21] she said but how come everything he's
[9:22] saying this is exactly what you're
[9:24] saying over there amen
[9:26] so brother child has been a true true
[9:29] brother to me
[9:32] a very good friend
[9:34] and i wonder a lot i say how come
[9:38] i've been in this country for a long
[9:40] time and never knew you
[9:42] and one of my uh
[9:45] our deacon
[9:46] home usually say he said god hit you
[9:49] both
[9:51] and when he came down and we had a
[9:53] wonderful fellowship together i told
[9:54] sister angie i said sister angie we need
[9:57] to go ahead probably and have a dna test
[10:02] you might be seated a little bit
[10:05] i say we need to go have a dna test
[10:08] because something is wrong everything
[10:10] i'm saying is right there
[10:12] amen
[10:14] oh my
[10:18] just to corner the serpent seed
[10:22] we know brother branham spoke about the
[10:24] serpent seed
[10:26] and there was an event that happened
[10:28] in our time
[10:30] to confirm or vindicate the serpent seed
[10:34] you know what happened right
[10:36] there is a woman
[10:37] that got pregnant
[10:39] and she had two children
[10:42] one
[10:43] was an african-american and another one
[10:45] was a caucasian
[10:47] that was to vindicate the serpent seed
[10:50] teaching
[10:52] but if you go in the book of revelation
[10:55] chapter five when the seal when the lamb
[10:58] came
[10:59] and pick up the book and broke the seal
[11:02] the bible say out of every kindred
[11:05] tongue and language
[11:07] that's a different breed right there a
[11:10] man
[11:11] out of every country
[11:13] god
[11:14] have his children
[11:15] just like brother marcus explained
[11:17] yesterday that when god came throughout
[11:20] the ages he began to kind of propose his
[11:23] children left and right
[11:25] so i was born back home in africa he was
[11:28] born here but we have the same father
[11:31] amen
[11:32] not to vindicate the serpent seed but to
[11:35] vindicate our origin that we all come
[11:38] from god and we're going back again to
[11:41] god amen
[11:43] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[11:45] really really
[11:46] enjoy the fellowship here thank brother
[11:50] chad
[11:51] from the bottom from of my heart god
[11:53] richly bless you and sister angie and
[11:55] the church
[11:56] we really really really really enjoy the
[11:58] fellowship god richly bless you amen
[12:02] so i'm gonna take my liberty i'm a home
[12:06] usually the way i preach at home
[12:09] i take them to a trip
[12:12] so some of you has been in the airplane
[12:14] already amen
[12:16] so we're going to get into a trip
[12:18] so the the reason why i usually take the
[12:22] analogy of an airplane
[12:24] it means we're going to leave the earth
[12:26] we're going to forget about our bills
[12:27] forget about our home
[12:29] forget about our laundries and
[12:31] everything
[12:32] so let's go a little bit and soar in the
[12:34] heavenly places
[12:35] amen and i can tell you straight ahead
[12:38] who's the captain of this trip
[12:40] it is not me it's the captain of our
[12:42] salvation so his name is the lord jesus
[12:45] christ
[12:46] amen
[12:48] amen
[12:49] and the first officer is brother
[12:51] chadland
[12:54] i am the second officer
[12:57] in other words a relief pilot
[12:59] so that when the first officer is
[13:01] sitting enjoying so we're there right
[13:03] beside the great captain just to work
[13:05] together so if you have any problem we
[13:07] got flight attendant the deacon back
[13:09] there they should be able to help you up
[13:12] and then
[13:13] so keep your seat belt buckling pretty
[13:16] good
[13:17] and we will be leaving the airport
[13:19] sooner amen
[13:21] so welcome on board on llama bcf airport
[13:25] the captain jesus christ is on board
[13:30] and sooner we're going to leave the
[13:32] airport amen you know when you come into
[13:35] this kind of meeting convention you
[13:37] wonder what to preach
[13:39] and i asked brother chad i just want to
[13:41] make sure you stay within the theme
[13:44] that the local pastor wants you to to be
[13:48] in
[13:48] and i asked him i said brother child
[13:50] what is the theme of the meeting
[13:52] and he told me he said our theme has
[13:55] always been the turtle
[13:58] so when you say the third pull to me
[14:02] you just put a fish and put him in the
[14:04] water
[14:06] and then he says the third po it's the
[14:09] opening of the word
[14:11] so you're gonna hear me traveling
[14:13] different avenues so just know i'm in
[14:16] the third pool
[14:17] amen
[14:18] ready for the word
[14:20] blessed be the name of the lord we'll be
[14:22] all right just keep your seat belt and
[14:24] we're gonna go up
[14:25] amen
[14:26] let's go to exodus chapter
[14:29] 25
[14:35] i was studying
[14:37] a lot of stuff
[14:40] that i thought i'm going to be preaching
[14:42] here
[14:44] but this one keep coming back up again
[14:47] over and over amen
[14:52] it's a new subject that i thought i'm
[14:54] going to preach
[14:56] the church later on by the holy spirit
[14:58] quicken it recently
[15:00] so i tried to use a different avenue and
[15:03] it's like an explosion it kept coming up
[15:06] coming up coming up i told brother
[15:08] robert i say i don't know what to do
[15:11] it's like when the smoke are in a
[15:13] sanctuary the minister can minister no
[15:15] more everywhere you see it's just smoke
[15:18] i'm still looking at the same subject
[15:20] over and over amen
[15:22] so
[15:23] i felt like this is what the lord wants
[15:25] me to speak
[15:27] so you relax and
[15:29] everything will be all right
[15:31] amen
[15:32] i know brother chad pretty good now
[15:36] recently we
[15:38] ministered a little bit uh we were
[15:41] talking a little bit
[15:43] and i took the lever and i moved it to
[15:45] two
[15:47] because we were talking about the zodiac
[15:51] so we went in the constellation and he
[15:54] took the lever and he moved it to five
[15:59] do you know what he means
[16:02] so i'd say okay he's pretty good with
[16:04] five i took the lever and i moved it to
[16:06] seven
[16:09] and he took it all the way to nine
[16:12] i say okay that's pretty nice
[16:14] i'll pull it to 12
[16:16] and here he goes to 50 and i say that's
[16:18] it that's good enough
[16:21] so that's a man that i can talk to him
[16:23] plainly
[16:25] in a message
[16:27] because this message is so sacred
[16:30] and it's so deep
[16:32] and i don't even think we're gonna leave
[16:34] this world finishing what is in this
[16:36] message
[16:37] what is sealed down to the bible
[16:40] is completely
[16:42] beyond human imagination
[16:44] amen you can spend an hour
[16:47] talk about the word over and over and
[16:50] over because it's so rich
[16:52] amen
[16:53] exodus chapter 25
[16:56] verse 1. if you're there you can say
[16:57] amen
[16:58] okay that's pretty good
[17:02] and the lord spoke to moses saying
[17:05] speak to the children of israel that
[17:07] they bring me an offering
[17:10] of any of every man
[17:12] that give it willingly with his heart
[17:15] you shall take my offering you might be
[17:18] seated
[17:19] and this is the offering
[17:22] which you shall take of them gold
[17:25] and silver and brass
[17:27] and blue and purple and scarlet
[17:30] and fine lining and goat hair everything
[17:33] here
[17:34] is a problem
[17:36] and rem skin dyed red and badger skin
[17:39] and shadow mood
[17:41] oil for the light
[17:43] spices for anointing all and for sweet
[17:46] answers
[17:48] onyx stone
[17:49] and stone
[17:50] to be set in the effort and in the
[17:53] breastplate
[17:55] and let them make me a sanctuary
[17:58] that i may dwell among them so god
[18:02] wanted to dwell in the midst of his
[18:04] children amen
[18:06] verse 9
[18:08] how do you make this sanctuary according
[18:11] to all that i show you so moses had a
[18:15] vision
[18:16] after the pattern
[18:18] of the tabernacle
[18:20] and the pattern of all the instrument
[18:23] thereof
[18:24] even so shall you make it
[18:27] so moses saw something in heaven
[18:31] moses saw a temple in heaven
[18:34] moses saw a tabernacle in heaven
[18:37] and god after giving him the movie
[18:41] when he finished god say everything that
[18:44] you saw there
[18:45] i want you to get down here
[18:47] and make sure you reproduce everything
[18:50] on the earth anybody clear so far keep
[18:53] your seat belt we're going to leave soon
[18:55] amen
[18:56] let's go to chapter 26
[18:59] now job first to verse 40.
[19:03] i got a tendency home to turn around and
[19:06] look at the glad and i forgot that it's
[19:08] right here
[19:13] verse 40
[19:15] of exodus 25 and look that you make them
[19:18] after their pattern
[19:21] which will show you in the mount
[19:23] everybody clear
[19:24] let's go to chapter 26 verse 30 now
[19:30] if you dare you can hire a man
[19:35] verse 30 and you shall hear up the
[19:37] tabernacle
[19:39] according to the fashion thereof which
[19:42] was showed you in the mouth
[19:45] god insisted
[19:47] that moses make sure what you duplicate
[19:50] here on earth is exactly matching heaven
[19:54] so if you've never been in heaven
[19:59] you need to contact moses
[20:04] and when you get in contact with moses
[20:06] moses can show you the pattern
[20:09] of things that are in heaven even though
[20:12] you are not in heaven yet but you can
[20:14] have a test of heaven
[20:16] through the ministry of moses
[20:19] amen
[20:20] let's go to acts chapter 7
[20:24] hallelujah
[20:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[20:30] acts chapter 7
[20:32] verse 44 if you're there you can say
[20:34] amen

[20:39] i'm home
[20:45] verse 44 our father had a tabernacle of
[20:49] weakness in the wilderness
[20:52] as he had appointed
[20:54] speaking to moses that he should make it
[20:58] according to the fashion that he had
[21:00] seen
[21:02] repeat it again stay with the pattern
[21:05] make sure everything that you do is
[21:08] exactly what was demonstrated to you in
[21:11] heaven
[21:12] amen
[21:13] let's go to revelation chapter 15 then
[21:16] we will pray
[21:23] hallelujah
[21:29] so right here
[21:31] you can understand that there is a
[21:33] tabernacle earthly speaking
[21:36] and there is a tabernacle in heaven
[21:38] so as we move along we will be flipping
[21:41] our camera up and down

[24:14] it comes to interpret and unfold your
[24:16] word
[24:17] it's only a working of the holy spirit
[24:20] father may you move me completely out of
[24:23] the way
[24:24] may you be the one speaking this morning
[24:25] and blessing your children be the alpha
[24:28] and the omega of this service father we
[24:31] seal the devil completely out and we
[24:33] commit all unto the hand in the name of
[24:37] jesus christ
[24:38] amen
[24:40] blessed be the name of the lord
[24:43] we had a wonderful service last night
[24:46] and i found out that brother marcus
[24:48] speak french
[24:50] so the next time he'll be around we'll
[24:52] sit down and talk in french more
[24:54] amen
[24:56] what are you preaching this morning
[24:59] my subject this morning
[25:02] is the mystery
[25:04] of the sea of glass
[25:07] this sea of gas is also called in the
[25:10] scripture
[25:12] delivered pastor told me
[25:15] the third pull
[25:16] so let's relax and keep your back of
[25:18] seat as we're taking off amen
[25:22] why
[25:24] are you preaching about are you tattling
[25:28] this sermon a mystery
[25:30] why mysteries
[25:34] hallelujah
[25:36] brother branham says this
[25:39] that the bible is written in mysteries
[25:44] amen
[25:45] jesus thanked the father for it see
[25:48] that he was wrote in mysteries
[25:52] and in a stature of the perfect man
[25:54] brother branham say
[25:56] but when you can see that the scripture
[25:58] is not contradictory
[26:00] that you can say that and can see
[26:03] that by revelation of god the whole word
[26:08] is wrote in mysteries
[26:11] and only the knowledge of god can reveal
[26:14] it
[26:15] and when you get and say punctuate every
[26:18] word of god with an amen then add that
[26:22] to your faith so the whole scripture
[26:25] right here the whole bible was written
[26:28] in mysteries
[26:29] anybody clear so far
[26:31] brother branham continued he said but
[26:34] a mystery requires the teaching
[26:38] of the spirit
[26:40] or it never becomes clear
[26:43] not the teaching of a man
[26:46] not the teaching of a bishop
[26:48] not the teaching of a scholar but the
[26:51] teaching of the holy spirit
[26:53] because man of old spoke as they were
[26:57] moved by the holy ghost
[26:59] amen
[27:00] brother branham said how do we
[27:02] need to hear from god
[27:04] and lay ourselves open and become
[27:07] yielded to the spirit to hear and know
[27:11] amen
[27:13] brother branham continues
[27:15] he say gods wrote it in riddles
[27:18] and parables so that he could hide it
[27:22] from the eyes of the wise
[27:25] and prudent
[27:26] and reveal it to babes such as would
[27:29] learn
[27:30] so god had to do it this way to hide
[27:34] that from the serpentine
[27:36] because not everybody can be saved
[27:40] even though christ died for everyone but
[27:43] not everybody will be saved
[27:46] amen when boaz was doing the work of
[27:49] redemption
[27:50] he was redeeming naomi but in his
[27:53] backpack man he knew that he was after
[27:56] roof
[27:57] even though it looks like he was
[27:59] redeeming naomi but in his back part man
[28:02] he was actually aiming to a bride and
[28:05] that bride was roof
[28:08] everybody clear so far
[28:09] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[28:12] branham continued he said jesus thank
[28:14] the father for doing it
[28:17] doing what hiding
[28:20] selling the word
[28:24] amen
[28:25] is that right
[28:26] because you don't know
[28:28] it's like reading a newspaper
[28:31] it is a spiritual revelation
[28:33] and it's revealed to them who are
[28:36] interested in
[28:37] learning it
[28:39] everybody cares so far
[28:40] now we found out here that brother
[28:42] branham said god hide it
[28:45] from the wise and the prudent
[28:47] and he liked to do that
[28:51] let's continue again in the revelation
[28:53] series brother branham say so you watch
[28:56] as these things unfold themselves
[28:59] he run right back around and open up the
[29:01] book
[29:02] so now this actually gives the picture
[29:05] of the entire bible
[29:08] and the seal
[29:09] that is got the bible heed
[29:12] from the eyes of the wise and the
[29:14] protest
[29:15] brother branham just said that god hide
[29:18] it
[29:18] from the wise and the prudent
[29:20] now brother branham give us more
[29:22] information
[29:24] he said the way god hides it
[29:27] he hides it by sealing it
[29:32] so the seal actually hides the mysteries
[29:36] of god
[29:37] hallelujah
[29:39] he said he's there and the seals that
[29:41] he's got the bible hid from the eyes of
[29:43] the wise and the prudent
[29:45] god by the holy spirit is opening them
[29:49] up like this
[29:50] and revealing them right around through
[29:52] the bible glory to god so now we
[29:55] understand that the full bible is
[29:58] written in mysteries
[29:59] god did it purposely
[30:01] and how did he hide it he hide it
[30:04] through the seals
[30:05] so in other words to understand the
[30:08] bible clearly their seals got to be
[30:11] broken
[30:13] hallelujah
[30:14] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[30:17] branham said the lamb
[30:18] was breaking this hills
[30:20] and god still was not going to reveal it
[30:24] you say brother stephen people has been
[30:27] preaching this bible for all along
[30:30] so you telling me they didn't have
[30:32] revelation
[30:36] because the holy spirit worked with paul
[30:39] he worked with luther he worked with
[30:41] columba he worked with many preachers
[30:44] throughout the ages
[30:45] so if you say the bible was sealed
[30:48] so nobody understood anything that's not
[30:51] what we're saying
[30:52] brother branham saying the lamb was
[30:54] breaking the seals
[30:56] and god still was not going to reveal it
[31:00] he was left for the last days
[31:03] now
[31:04] we had samples
[31:06] and we have probated
[31:08] and done very good sometime
[31:12] not all the time
[31:14] only sometime
[31:16] so did god use the other people
[31:18] throughout the ages yes sir
[31:22] but they did not have the perfect
[31:25] interpretation of the scripture until
[31:28] the seals are
[31:30] broken here so far
[31:33] brother branham said they've done very
[31:35] good sometime
[31:36] but we know it's moving right on
[31:39] but now in the last days
[31:41] we can look back and see where it has
[31:44] been and that is supposed to be done
[31:47] that
[31:48] at the end of the church ages just
[31:50] before the rapture
[31:52] he continues again he say we have
[31:54] prohibited through the years
[31:57] and according to the scripture there was
[31:59] no way
[32:00] to understand it until this day
[32:04] because it has been hidden
[32:06] we have seen the symbols
[32:09] what he was symbolized by
[32:11] it could not be correctly
[32:14] revealed until the last day
[32:18] was luther
[32:20] inspired by god yes sir
[32:22] was westlake inspired by god yes sir
[32:26] did the pentecostal have the revelation
[32:28] yes sir
[32:30] but still the book was still still
[32:33] it required a prophetic ministry
[32:36] in order to unfold what was written in
[32:40] the scripture
[32:42] everybody cares so far brother branham
[32:44] said could not be correctly revealed
[32:47] until the last day
[32:48] now then we must be there at the end
[32:51] time everybody cares so far
[32:54] why did branham continue he said now
[32:56] remember no man in heaven
[32:59] no man in the earth
[33:01] pope bishop cardinal state presbyter and
[33:05] whoever he is
[33:06] can break them seal and reveal the book
[33:09] but the lamb
[33:12] not even brother branham
[33:14] brother branham have to wait for the
[33:16] lamb
[33:17] to open the scripture
[33:19] and we have probe
[33:21] and presume
[33:23] and stumbled and wandered and that is
[33:26] the reason we are in such a confusion
[33:32] because things were let loose
[33:34] until the end time
[33:36] but random says first corinthians 13
[33:39] says
[33:40] when that which is perfect is come
[33:43] that which is in part shall be done away
[33:47] so are these little things of
[33:49] jumping up and down like a kid
[33:52] trying to talk in tongue
[33:54] and all these other things
[33:56] when that which is perfect
[33:59] and we do have today by god's help the
[34:03] perfect interpretation
[34:05] of the word with divine vindication
[34:09] [Applause]
[34:10] because paul said i preach important
[34:16] iranians preaching part
[34:19] columba preached important martin
[34:22] preaching part luther preaching part but
[34:25] at the end time the light of the sun
[34:29] shall be like the light of the moon but
[34:31] the light of the moon shall be like a
[34:34] light of seven days
[34:36] he takes the day of power he takes the
[34:39] day of arenas he takes the day of
[34:41] columba it takes the day of luther it
[34:44] takes the day of wesley and he bring it
[34:46] all together into a constellation
[34:49] [Applause]
[34:51] no one the brother branham said when he
[34:52] entered the constellation
[34:54] all the six centuries were familiar
[34:57] because they were already being used
[34:59] throughout the ages
[35:00] he can recognize that
[35:02] but there was one that was peculiar that
[35:04] was the seventh year
[35:06] amen
[35:08] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[35:10] then that which is part is done away
[35:13] when i was a child i speak as a child i
[35:16] understood as a child but when i became
[35:19] a man i put away childish things amen
[35:23] the mystery was in the seventh hill now
[35:26] we understand it when these seventh seal
[35:29] was open
[35:30] that opened up the entire bible
[35:35] the seventh year he was sealed with
[35:38] seven mysteries and in them seven still
[35:41] had the entire mystery of it
[35:44] the bible is written in mysteries
[35:47] those mysteries were sealed under the
[35:50] seventh seal and only the breaking of
[35:53] the sevens here can unfold all those
[35:56] mystery clearly in our generation
[35:59] [Applause]
[36:01] hallelujah the seventh seal of the
[36:03] hidden mysteries
[36:05] of the entire bible will be open and
[36:08] fulfill revelation 10 that in the
[36:10] seventh angel's message this thing
[36:13] should come to pass
[36:14] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[36:17] before our eyes
[36:19] this day is this scripture fulfilled
[36:22] so we understand now
[36:24] that the bible was written a mystery
[36:27] and those mysteries were broken up were
[36:29] unfolded
[36:32] so if they are folded
[36:35] is that for our intellectual knowledge
[36:40] brother branham said as daniel heard the
[36:43] seven thunder
[36:45] and forbidden
[36:47] and john heard the voices
[36:49] and this book was sealed
[36:51] and the back of the book was sealed with
[36:53] seven seals
[36:55] but in the days of these seals
[36:58] to be opened the mystery of god will be
[37:01] finished in other words
[37:03] god will be known to his church
[37:07] not in three persons
[37:09] but as one person
[37:11] the mystery of god will be revealed and
[37:13] when that was completely revealed then
[37:16] the seventh mystery will be opened to
[37:18] the church
[37:20] because in there
[37:22] the church will be living under an
[37:24] inspiration of the holy spirit
[37:26] him moving in and out
[37:28] and showing his signs of being alive
[37:30] among us
[37:31] living among us and we are then
[37:33] worshipping the living christ that is
[37:36] among us
[37:37] so the sales open christ i'm there the
[37:40] mighty god before us
[37:43] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[37:46] so if the seal
[37:49] hide the book
[37:50] somebody must break that seal
[37:53] and we know it's only the lamb
[37:55] but the lamb is up there
[37:58] and someone must be here
[38:00] that can match that office
[38:02] everybody because
[38:05] if we don't have the opening of the
[38:08] seals there is no way we can make it to
[38:10] the rapture
[38:13] anybody here
[38:14] there was two banquets in esther
[38:18] everybody
[38:19] in the first banquet
[38:21] hammond was happy
[38:24] haman was enjoying the wine as much as
[38:27] the king was enjoying the wine
[38:30] a heaven was sitting without any fear
[38:34] and matter of fact when he left he was
[38:36] so happy until he bragged about three
[38:39] things
[38:42] he brag about the glory of his riches
[38:45] the lust of the eyes
[38:47] he brag about the multitude of his
[38:49] children and we know we receive children
[38:52] by flesh the last of the flesh
[38:54] and he brag about the promotion that the
[38:57] king put unto him the pride of life
[39:00] amen but in between esther chapter 5 and
[39:04] esther chapter 7 where we have the
[39:07] second banquet we see esther chapter 6
[39:10] there and six is the number of a man and
[39:14] in esther chapter 6 something happened
[39:17] the king stayed in the palace and
[39:20] somebody took the king's chariot
[39:23] the king horses
[39:24] the king rob
[39:26] the king crown and put it on mordechai
[39:29] and have to walk mordecai all around
[39:32] throughout the city so if you've never
[39:35] seen the king before you just watch
[39:38] mordecai mordecai unfold the hidden king
[39:41] to you
[39:45] until if your vision is not too clear
[39:48] you might mistake mordechai for the king
[39:52] because he was wearing the king's robe
[39:55] he was having the king's crown he was
[39:58] riding on the king's ward he was a son
[40:00] of man revealing this son of man that
[40:04] was sitting in the palace
[40:08] so he takes the revelation of the son of
[40:11] man to bring you into the second banquet
[40:15] and in the evening time then the second
[40:17] banquet open up
[40:19] that's when airmen become powerless
[40:23] hallelujah
[40:25] so to break
[40:26] the silence of a king you need an office
[40:30] who's going to break that a pastor
[40:33] a teacher
[40:34] an evangelist
[40:35] an apostle
[40:37] brother the bible say in amos chapter
[40:40] 3 verse 7
[40:42] surely
[40:43] the lord god do sometime
[40:47] okay somebody's not sleeping
[40:50] but here the lord god do nothing
[40:56] except but he reveal his secret unto his
[41:00] servant the prophet so the one who can
[41:04] break the silence of god is only a
[41:07] prophetic office
[41:09] [Music]
[41:12] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[41:14] lord and the word comes only to the
[41:17] prophet
[41:18] the word prophet
[41:20] means a revealer of the divine written
[41:24] word
[41:25] the same as he does a foreteller see or
[41:29] a seer and the seer how the one you know
[41:33] is telling forth he's divinely
[41:35] vindicated by foreseeing it comes to
[41:37] pass in other words when a prophet speak
[41:40] and that happened you need to listen to
[41:41] him
[41:42] how many time he did he spoke and it
[41:44] happened
[41:46] what further evidence do you want
[41:48] amen
[41:50] brother branham said the holy ghost is
[41:52] the only revealer of the divine
[41:55] revelation of christ
[41:57] he just spoke he said the prophet does
[41:59] it
[42:00] now he say the holy ghost does it
[42:03] is he contradicting himself
[42:07] the holy ghost is the only revealer of
[42:10] the divine revelation of christ
[42:12] there is no school can do it no scholar
[42:15] can do it no man how well educated how
[42:19] godly or anything there is no man can do
[42:22] it the holy ghost alone
[42:24] is the revealer of the divine revelation
[42:28] of christ and has been in all ages
[42:31] remember all ages
[42:34] you need a prophet anointed by the holy
[42:37] ghost
[42:38] that's why you have something like this
[42:43] a vindicated prophet with the pillar of
[42:46] fire
[42:47] a son of man revealing the son of man
[42:51] amen so we can say that we're not
[42:53] feeding in the word of man but we are
[42:55] feeding upon the unfailing body word of
[42:58] the son of man brother branham said it
[43:01] was the end time period
[43:03] that the seventh thunder of jesus christ
[43:05] came forth revelation 10 3 4
[43:08] and cried with a loud voice and when as
[43:11] it was when the line wrote
[43:13] and when he cried seven standards
[43:15] ordered their voices i'm gonna go to the
[43:17] red
[43:18] what was in those standards no one knows
[43:22] but we need to know
[43:24] who can break the silence of god
[43:26] only a prophet
[43:28] and he will take a prophet
[43:30] to get the revelation because god has no
[43:34] other way
[43:35] he can do nothing of bringing out his
[43:38] scriptural revelation
[43:40] except by a prophet
[43:42] the word always come by a prophet and
[43:46] always will
[43:49] and we thank god for a prophet in this
[43:51] end time that can break the seals for us
[43:54] amen the very day when this message not
[43:58] when he started on but when he begin to
[44:00] declare his message the first pool we
[44:03] know it's healing the second pool is
[44:05] prophesying by the third pool the
[44:08] opening of the word the mysteries
[44:10] revealed so when i say the mystery of
[44:13] the sea of glass
[44:15] i am not preaching a new mystery
[44:18] i'm only preaching reveal the mystery
[44:22] ever here
[44:23] so no more there is no higher order to
[44:26] reveal the word than the prophet but the
[44:29] only way the prophet can be vindicated
[44:32] is by the word and remember the third
[44:35] pool was the opening of them seven seal
[44:38] to reveal the hidden truth that has been
[44:41] sealed in the world
[44:43] amen
[44:44] blessed be the name of the lord the
[44:46] bible said my people are destroyed for
[44:49] lack of knowledge
[44:51] the first eve fell because the seal was
[44:54] the book was sealed the second he fell
[44:57] because the book was here but this eve
[45:00] will never fail again
[45:02] because we're not looking into a close
[45:04] book but we're looking into an open book
[45:11] hallelujah
[45:13] because that has rejected knowledge i
[45:16] will also reject you that there shall be
[45:18] no priest to me remember you reject
[45:21] knowledge you can be a priest seeing
[45:23] that i have forgetted the law of that
[45:25] god i will also forget that children
[45:29] in daniel chapter 12 the bible say he
[45:31] said go that way daniel for the word i
[45:34] close up
[45:36] and seal until the end time the end time
[45:40] of the end at the time of the end
[45:42] many shall be purified purify by what
[45:50] the mysteries of god
[45:52] when they are truly unfolded to you you
[45:55] cannot live an unclean life
[46:00] because mysteries has been blamed
[46:04] in this message
[46:06] to be responsible for people and clean
[46:08] living
[46:09] someone who truly receives a knowledge a
[46:13] correct knowledge a perfect
[46:15] interpretation by the scripture by the
[46:19] holy ghost of the mystery can no more be
[46:21] the same person
[46:24] hallelujah
[46:25] many shall be purified and made white
[46:29] and even try
[46:31] the judgment amen
[46:33] but the wicked will do wickedly and none
[46:36] of the wicked shall understand but the
[46:38] why shall
[46:40] understand hallelujah
[46:43] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[46:46] understand now that the scripture is
[46:48] blocked
[46:49] hidden by the mysteries and only the
[46:51] prophet can unfold the mysteries so what
[46:54] is a mystery
[46:58] verb
[47:00] he said the mystery
[47:02] and mystery is scripture
[47:05] is a previously hidden truth
[47:08] now divinely revealed
[47:10] we understand that by a prophet now
[47:12] but which is
[47:14] a supernatural element still remain
[47:17] despite the revelation
[47:21] because
[47:22] if the devil takes the book of the seal
[47:24] and read it he's going to understand the
[47:26] seal
[47:29] he will understand it
[47:30] but he didn't really get the revelation
[47:34] amen anybody that went to school can
[47:37] pick up a spoken word book and read it
[47:39] and fill the intellectual knowledge but
[47:42] that is not the revelation
[47:44] because a mystery even though it's open
[47:48] there is still a supernatural element
[47:52] that locks the mystery despite the
[47:54] revelation that's why john was told by
[47:58] the angel after revelation 10 7 go
[48:02] yourself to the angel and god take the
[48:05] book don't go and beg the angel because
[48:08] that book doesn't belong to the angel
[48:11] when it was sealed it belongs to god but
[48:14] when it's revealed it doesn't belong to
[48:17] god anymore it belongs to me and it
[48:20] belongs to my family so when you see me
[48:23] and god don't give god the book you need
[48:26] to bring it to me
[48:27] it doesn't belong to god anymore
[48:30] john never went there and said please
[48:31] can i get the book he said can i have
[48:34] the book there and just say he doesn't
[48:35] understand you yet
[48:40] they told you go take the book
[48:42] they didn't say go back the angel you
[48:45] must have a contact with the angel and
[48:48] the book
[48:50] and when he get there he said give me
[48:52] the book then just say you don't
[48:54] understand
[48:55] in heaven you didn't have any right to
[48:58] touch the book we are no longer in
[49:00] heaven this is the earth you come and
[49:02] take it yourself exercise your god-given
[49:06] right
[49:06] go and grab the book it belongs to you
[49:10] and don't even keep it swallowed
[49:13] so god will never receive it back
[49:16] anymore
[49:16] [Applause]
[49:19] in adam the book was in his hand
[49:22] god could take the book back but today
[49:25] the book is not in a hand the book is
[49:28] imagined and it's god want to take the
[49:31] book god is obligated to take me too
[49:36] because me and the book we are one
[49:41] blessed be the name of the lord we
[49:44] already left the airport so keep your
[49:45] seat belt the airplane is still this way
[49:50] hallelujah
[49:52] brother branham say may i just pass this
[49:54] to you when the supernatural comes in
[49:57] that is the mind of christ
[50:01] so you need a contact with the angel
[50:04] if not you will never understand this
[50:06] message
[50:07] you can understand that humanistically
[50:09] speaking and you can get in trouble with
[50:12] it
[50:12] brother branham says this
[50:15] he says now when god is silent
[50:18] we had better be silent but when he had
[50:21] spoken we had better speak to
[50:26] god spoke
[50:27] i'm not going to keep my mouth quiet
[50:31] anybody here
[50:32] when israel was given
[50:35] the commission to go around jericho
[50:38] for six days nobody was supposed to
[50:41] speak
[50:42] because the power of the spoken word was
[50:44] closed
[50:45] everybody must be quiet
[50:49] they didn't want anybody to say
[50:51] we look like stupid here
[50:53] just going around this way
[50:55] god help block that up
[50:58] can you imagine look they're making fun
[51:00] of us they say we hold you really with a
[51:02] long skirt
[51:04] and look at the way we're going
[51:06] quiet
[51:07] until the seventh day
[51:09] and in the seventh day you go around the
[51:12] city seventh time then nobody was
[51:14] supposed to remain silent anymore you
[51:17] must open up your mouth and speak loud
[51:20] so the enemy can hear you
[51:22] and the speech brought the wall of
[51:24] jericho down
[51:27] hallelujah
[51:29] blessed be the name of the lord but when
[51:31] we have spoke better he has spoken we
[51:34] have better speak to and say what he has
[51:37] already said that's what confession me
[51:40] he taught us the evidence of what would
[51:43] happen after being baptized with the
[51:45] holy spirit
[51:46] what we will have
[51:48] the teacher come and teach all truth
[51:51] but
[51:52] that teacher
[51:54] was a me sad teacher
[51:57] not an outside teacher
[52:00] if the spirit was not inside you will
[52:02] not hear the truth and receive it by
[52:06] revelation
[52:07] if you heard that every moment of the
[52:10] day
[52:12] you need a supernatural element
[52:15] to unfold it
[52:16] even though it's unfolded there is a
[52:19] supernatural key despite the revelation
[52:22] that was the son of the indwelling
[52:25] spirit in the days of paul those who
[52:28] were filled with the holy ghost heard
[52:30] the word receive it and live by it
[52:34] those who did not have the spirit
[52:37] heard it only as corner man
[52:41] so if you see somebody struggling in a
[52:43] message probably they have not heard it
[52:45] yet
[52:47] they heard but they have not heard it
[52:49] let them hear who have their ear
[52:52] hear what the spirit said not this one
[52:55] it's a different earring everybody here
[52:58] those who did not have the spirit heard
[53:01] it only as conor man put a wrong
[53:04] interpretation on it and went in sin so
[53:07] if somebody got a mystery and singing
[53:11] clearly it's a wrong interpretation the
[53:14] inside teacher is not there they have
[53:16] not contacted the supernatural element
[53:19] yet that is connected to the mystery
[53:22] everybody cares so far
[53:24] blessed be the name of the lord so
[53:26] what is going on with this mystery of
[53:30] the sea of glass
[53:31] what's going on
[53:34] what is the sea of glass this liver
[53:36] what's going on with it
[53:38] amen
[53:41] god we just spoke that he hide himself
[53:45] in mysteries
[53:47] these mysteries
[53:49] that god had himself
[53:53] have many forms
[53:56] god
[53:59] hide himself
[54:02] in images
[54:06] everybody
[54:08] these images are called symbols
[54:12] god hide himself
[54:15] in words
[54:18] or in history
[54:21] yes
[54:22] here
[54:23] when you read the bible you're going to
[54:25] read about the story of abraham
[54:28] it is not truly a story
[54:31] you can read about joseph
[54:33] it is not really a story
[54:36] because you will see when joseph
[54:38] was picked by his brother
[54:40] and they took his coat off they put him
[54:43] into a pit and they took the court and
[54:45] sent it back to his father
[54:47] that is not a story
[54:49] god was speaking something behind the
[54:52] story
[54:53] because he was portraying somebody who
[54:56] when he comes he will be taken by his
[54:59] brother and his spirit will be taken off
[55:02] and sent back to the father
[55:07] god had his mysteries
[55:10] in numbers
[55:14] or he hides it in measurement
[55:19] everybody clear
[55:20] god had his mysteries in punctuation
[55:29] when jesus went to the temple
[55:31] he took the book of isaiah he never
[55:34] wrote the entire he never read the
[55:37] entire verse
[55:38] he read it until the middle where there
[55:41] was a camera and stopped reading
[55:44] that karma means a change of
[55:46] dispensation
[55:47] [Applause]
[55:48] it is not a common camera it is a
[55:51] scriptural camera
[55:52] [Applause]
[55:56] [Music]
[55:57] hallelujah
[55:59] god hide
[56:01] his mysteries in genealogy
[56:07] so when you're reading the bible you see
[56:09] an image
[56:10] there is something there
[56:12] abraham walking there is something there
[56:15] enoch work with god what kind of work
[56:18] was that
[56:20] why was he walking with god and god took
[56:23] him do you think he was just walking
[56:24] like this
[56:28] god hide his mysteries in form
[56:32] in symbols in word in stories
[56:37] in punctuation in numbers number one
[56:39] number two number three all these
[56:42] friends have a language
[56:46] hallelujah
[56:47] blessed be the name of the lord
[56:50] so when god hides his stories in the
[56:54] uh his mysteries into this kind of
[56:57] formula
[56:58] we are dealing tonight uh this morning
[57:00] with the
[57:02] the bro
[57:03] the lever or the sea of glass
[57:05] let's see exactly what is going on with
[57:08] this sea glass
[57:11] when god hides his mysteries
[57:14] not only are the mysteries hidden
[57:17] but there is something that is called
[57:20] the theme of the mysteries
[57:24] just relax the airplane is still like
[57:26] this
[57:27] sooner i'm going to be like this and
[57:29] i'll tell you to take the seat belt off
[57:33] anybody clear so far
[57:34] how about here so far because god told
[57:37] moses
[57:39] he said go
[57:41] and reproduce everything that you saw in
[57:43] heaven
[57:44] reproduce everything on this earth
[57:47] so when moses came
[57:50] moses began to work on the tabernacle
[57:52] and when we finish
[57:54] we see this
[57:58] blessed be the name of the lord
[58:00] when we look
[58:02] we say moses
[58:03] good morning good morning
[58:05] how are you doing i'm doing fine how did
[58:07] you sleep i slept well so you told us
[58:09] you spoke to god and you had a movie of
[58:11] heaven yes
[58:13] how was the tabernacle in heaven moses
[58:15] said this is it
[58:18] oh
[58:19] yeah there is a brazen altar
[58:21] there is a lever
[58:23] we can see the showbread
[58:25] we can see the table of the showbread we
[58:27] see the arc of the covenant what is
[58:29] going on
[58:32] what does it mean to us
[58:34] what is the meaning behind all of this
[58:36] the first chord the second chord all of
[58:38] this what is going on
[58:40] brother branham says this
[58:43] he say he is
[58:45] the principal theme of the entire bible
[58:50] if you read the bible
[58:52] and you don't see christ in every verse
[58:54] of it
[58:56] let me repeat it again
[58:58] if you don't see christ in every verse
[59:00] of it
[59:01] go back and read it again
[59:04] so when i read abraham it's crashed
[59:07] [Applause]
[59:09] when i'm reading jacob each quest
[59:13] when i read six measures of barley each
[59:16] quest
[59:18] when i read delight on each christ
[59:24] if everything in the scripture
[59:26] is christ
[59:28] why
[59:29] was not christ represented in one image
[59:33] why did christ want to express himself
[59:37] as an ark
[59:39] why did christ wanted to express himself
[59:42] as a level
[59:43] why did christ want to express himself
[59:46] as the table of the show bread
[59:48] why he was not only the table of the
[59:50] showbread that could be easy
[59:53] but he has to be the table of the
[59:54] showbread he has to be the veil he has
[59:57] to be the lever he has to be the brazen
[59:59] author he has to be the mercy seat he
[1:00:02] has to be the carryman he has to be
[1:00:04] abraham he has to be joseph he have to
[1:00:06] be jacob he have to be ezekiel why
[1:00:12] why not one thing
[1:00:15] so when you read joseph you read christ
[1:00:19] when you read abraham you read christ
[1:00:21] when you read jeremiah you read christ
[1:00:24] he was cry that's why brother branham
[1:00:26] said jeremiah was crossed joseph was
[1:00:29] crossed abraham was crushed moses was
[1:00:33] crushed but when jesus christ came
[1:00:36] everything that was in those prophets
[1:00:38] were gathered together into one person
[1:00:42] because he was the fullness of the
[1:00:44] godhead badly they had the spirit in
[1:00:47] person
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:51] but branham continued he said if you can
[1:00:54] see christ in every verse of the bible
[1:00:57] then you read it again because you have
[1:01:00] missed something the bible is crust
[1:01:03] he is the word
[1:01:06] he said he is the principal team of the
[1:01:09] bible he was in the prophet
[1:01:12] he was in the psalms
[1:01:15] he was in the history of the bible
[1:01:19] so when you're reading number you are
[1:01:21] reading christ
[1:01:24] when you're reading a story in the bible
[1:01:26] you're reading christ
[1:01:28] when you're reading a psalm you read in
[1:01:30] christ
[1:01:31] but work on the christ
[1:01:35] hallelujah because the christ is moses
[1:01:40] is different than the christ in noah
[1:01:44] yet it's the same quest
[1:01:47] it is a different manifestation or
[1:01:50] expression of christ
[1:01:52] so when you are in the time of noah and
[1:01:55] if you want to preach christ you better
[1:01:58] preach it like noah
[1:02:00] [Applause]
[1:02:02] any sermon different than noah will kill
[1:02:05] the people
[1:02:10] you preach christ
[1:02:11] according to the revelation of his
[1:02:15] mystery
[1:02:21] you're preaching crust
[1:02:23] crust as a lever means something crust
[1:02:26] as the show bread means something crust
[1:02:29] has the ark means something crossed as
[1:02:31] the tabernacle means something
[1:02:34] it's a different manifestation yet the
[1:02:37] same spirit manifesting itself in
[1:02:39] different ways expressing different
[1:02:42] attributes of this ending
[1:02:45] hallelujah
[1:02:46] he was in a prophet
[1:02:48] he was in a psalm he was in the history
[1:02:51] of the bible the bible is a prophetic
[1:02:54] book it's a historical book it's a book
[1:02:57] of love it's a book of song it's a book
[1:03:00] of love and there you find christ how
[1:03:03] can you handle this
[1:03:06] how can you handle something like this
[1:03:09] you can preach this for 30 years
[1:03:12] amen
[1:03:13] he said he was wasn't a prophet
[1:03:16] he was in a psalm he was in the history
[1:03:20] and he also in the bible is the thing
[1:03:23] that is to come
[1:03:25] he was before and until after what does
[1:03:28] he make him then the same yesterday
[1:03:31] today and forever
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:03:38] brother branham continued he said he is
[1:03:40] the thing
[1:03:41] he was the prophet he was in them
[1:03:44] he was the psalm he was in the history
[1:03:47] he is the thing to come the same
[1:03:49] yesterday today and forever
[1:03:51] then
[1:03:54] if he is that then he should be the
[1:03:56] principal theme of our talking
[1:04:00] of her thinking
[1:04:02] of her singing
[1:04:03] of her work he should be the principal
[1:04:06] theme of her life
[1:04:09] if he is the principal theme of the
[1:04:11] bible and the bible is in our hearts
[1:04:15] then he should be the principal thing of
[1:04:17] everything that we do all things should
[1:04:20] be crushed
[1:04:22] that's why i told the folks back home
[1:04:24] and say i'm gonna preach this message
[1:04:26] until you smell like the message
[1:04:29] until you speak like the message until
[1:04:32] you think like the message until you
[1:04:35] talk like the message until you walk
[1:04:37] like the message and still you brief
[1:04:39] like the message until you jump like the
[1:04:42] message until you become the messenger
[1:04:45] the living epistle of god made manifest
[1:04:48] [Applause]
[1:04:52] living book walking in two feet
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:57] brother branham said all the plan of
[1:04:59] redemption
[1:05:00] all the names
[1:05:02] all the symbols
[1:05:03] all the worship of the tabernacle all
[1:05:06] the wood my god
[1:05:08] all everything in the tabernacle
[1:05:11] everything spoke off class
[1:05:14] your answer is easy
[1:05:16] what does the lever speak of
[1:05:18] we can close the book and go home
[1:05:22] but work on the crust
[1:05:26] why is the show bread different than the
[1:05:28] liver
[1:05:32] anybody care
[1:05:34] but brandon said go god was back there
[1:05:37] in those hebrew prophets and so forth
[1:05:40] speaking and speaking to tom to the to
[1:05:42] that time of perfection that when jesus
[1:05:45] will come to perfect the believer
[1:05:48] jump down he said now all these feasts
[1:05:51] all the feasts the holidays all the
[1:05:54] tabernacles all the wood everything in
[1:05:56] the tabernacle everything tap crust
[1:06:00] all the offering my god
[1:06:02] all the laws everything was in top of
[1:06:05] christ
[1:06:08] so when you read your bible from now on
[1:06:10] it's a different story
[1:06:12] he said how the hazard the cedar wood
[1:06:16] and all mixing together how the wood in
[1:06:19] the tabernacle how the brazen altar
[1:06:22] deliver
[1:06:24] the showbread everything pointed to
[1:06:27] christ
[1:06:28] and he and in him we are complete in
[1:06:31] jesus christ
[1:06:33] we're going to get there now
[1:06:35] you can unbuckle all the furniture in
[1:06:38] the building top crust
[1:06:40] such as the level
[1:06:42] where the sacrifice was washed
[1:06:46] the brazen altar where he was slain and
[1:06:49] burned
[1:06:50] and the brass even in the altar speaks
[1:06:53] of judgment so there is a code there you
[1:06:56] need to be decoded to decode it you need
[1:06:58] a prophet anybody clear so far
[1:07:01] so now everything in this tabernacle
[1:07:05] speaks of christ
[1:07:06] but we're not talking about the brazen
[1:07:08] altar crust we're not talking about the
[1:07:11] the golden altar crust we're not talking
[1:07:14] about the ark of the covenant car crust
[1:07:17] but we are talking about the lever crust
[1:07:20] what is the crust
[1:07:22] behind the level
[1:07:23] what is the theme
[1:07:26] of christ behind the level what is the
[1:07:29] voice behind the lever what is the
[1:07:32] message behind the lever because the
[1:07:35] lever is talking
[1:07:37] when you see it it's telling you
[1:07:38] something
[1:07:40] it's not just a piece of furniture it
[1:07:42] has a message of god because it's
[1:07:45] reflecting crust
[1:07:46] the ark is talking it is not just a
[1:07:49] piece of art it is reflecting crust the
[1:07:52] show bread is talking it is not just
[1:07:55] bread it is talking of christ what is
[1:07:57] christ talking in the show brain what is
[1:08:00] he talking in a level what is he talking
[1:08:02] in a veil what is he talking on the
[1:08:04] second veil
[1:08:06] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:09] so we're dealing with delivery
[1:08:11] but uh the bible says this in exodus
[1:08:14] chapter 30.
[1:08:16] the bible said that shall also make a
[1:08:18] level
[1:08:19] of brass
[1:08:22] why breath
[1:08:23] why not gold
[1:08:26] why not silver because god told israel
[1:08:28] pick up the gold pick up the silver pick
[1:08:31] up the grass why was this specifically
[1:08:33] brass
[1:08:34] he said make
[1:08:36] a lever of brass and his foot also of
[1:08:40] brass to wash without
[1:08:42] so brother stephen you're telling me
[1:08:44] that the lever here
[1:08:46] of brass was just to wash
[1:08:49] wash what
[1:08:52] a beast
[1:08:53] take a bath
[1:08:55] wash our clothes
[1:08:57] wash our cars
[1:08:59] what are we washing
[1:09:00] what is the message behind this
[1:09:03] he said and that shall put it between
[1:09:05] the tabernacle of the congregation and
[1:09:09] the altar
[1:09:11] and that shall put water there in
[1:09:14] so it's not just
[1:09:16] a little pool but that pool
[1:09:19] must be of brass
[1:09:21] and you don't put juice there
[1:09:24] you don't put gasoline there
[1:09:26] you have to put water it's specific
[1:09:30] what do you do with water wash wash
[1:09:32] whoo verse 19
[1:09:35] for aaron
[1:09:37] and his son shall wash their hands
[1:09:41] and their feet their own
[1:09:43] so now we understand clearly that it's a
[1:09:46] pool of water
[1:09:48] it's made out of brass
[1:09:50] for the high priest and his children to
[1:09:52] wash
[1:09:53] watch what
[1:09:54] wash their feet
[1:09:56] and wash their hand
[1:09:57] what does it mean
[1:09:59] verse 20 when they go in the tabernacle
[1:10:03] of the congregation they shall wash with
[1:10:05] water
[1:10:06] that they die not
[1:10:09] so if you don't wash with this water and
[1:10:12] you try to enter the presence of god god
[1:10:15] kills you
[1:10:19] even though you are a priest
[1:10:21] even though by birth you are born a
[1:10:23] priest you are qualified to work for god
[1:10:27] you are qualified to approach god but
[1:10:29] before you approach god you must wash
[1:10:32] yourself through this water if you don't
[1:10:35] wash you don't enter the presence god
[1:10:37] kill you
[1:10:38] what kind of water is this
[1:10:42] what kind of water is this one that if i
[1:10:45] don't wash with it god kills me
[1:10:48] but i thought moses i saw you going to
[1:10:50] the river and picking up water there
[1:10:53] so the water in the river is not
[1:10:55] different than the water in this pool
[1:10:57] so why if i go wash there i cannot enter
[1:11:00] the presence of god you are telling me
[1:11:02] even though i took a bath in a river
[1:11:04] when i'm coming i must wash here first
[1:11:07] before entering god
[1:11:08] once the water reached that pool that
[1:11:11] water changes
[1:11:13] it is no more ordinary water
[1:11:16] it becomes a divine water
[1:11:18] [Applause]
[1:11:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:25] when they come near to the altar
[1:11:28] to minister to burn offering mad by fire
[1:11:32] unto the lord
[1:11:33] so they shall wash their hand and their
[1:11:35] feet
[1:11:36] that they die not and it shall be a
[1:11:39] statue forever to them even to him and
[1:11:43] to his seed throughout their generation
[1:11:45] no changes
[1:11:47] praise god
[1:11:48] we understand now a little bit about
[1:11:50] this level
[1:11:52] the bible continues in exodus 40. the
[1:11:54] bible say
[1:11:55] verse 6 and that shall set the altar
[1:11:59] of the burn offering before the door of
[1:12:03] the tabernacle of the tenth of the
[1:12:05] congregation i want you to listen here
[1:12:07] clearly
[1:12:09] he said and that shall set the lever
[1:12:12] between the tenth of the congregation
[1:12:15] and the altar
[1:12:17] so to make this a little bit clear
[1:12:20] let's go back to our pen here
[1:12:23] we have the tabernacle here
[1:12:27] the tabernacle is there
[1:12:30] we have the tabernacle here it's divided
[1:12:33] in three parts
[1:12:35] clear
[1:12:37] right here this is the sanctuary
[1:12:40] which they call the holy place
[1:12:43] here is the holiest
[1:12:46] so what happened god said put the bras
[1:12:48] an altar they put the bras and altar
[1:12:51] but it seems like when moses said put
[1:12:53] the bras an altar moses is saying put it
[1:12:56] at the door of the sanctuary in other
[1:12:58] words here
[1:13:00] that's what you would think
[1:13:01] but when you read the bible says take
[1:13:04] the level and put it between the altar
[1:13:08] and the tabernacle in other words in
[1:13:11] between the brazen altar here and the
[1:13:14] door of the tabernacle here there was
[1:13:16] the lever was here
[1:13:19] so the piece of furniture that was close
[1:13:23] to the door
[1:13:26] of the sanctuary
[1:13:27] is the level
[1:13:30] so the last piece you're going to meet
[1:13:33] before you enter into the sanctuary
[1:13:37] you must meet first 11.
[1:13:42] blessed be the name of the lord we go
[1:13:44] back there the bible say set the altar
[1:13:47] of the burnt offering before the door
[1:13:49] you see now
[1:13:51] of the tabernacle of the tent of the
[1:13:53] congregation it looks like it's the
[1:13:55] altar who is at the door but it's not
[1:13:57] verse seven and that shall set the level
[1:14:00] between
[1:14:02] the tenth of the congregation and the
[1:14:04] altar and shall put water there in we
[1:14:07] consistent now it's water
[1:14:09] verse 30 and he set the level between
[1:14:12] the tenth of the congregation
[1:14:14] and the altar and put water there to
[1:14:16] wash with her and moses and aaron and
[1:14:19] his son wash their hand and their feet
[1:14:22] they're it when they went into the tent
[1:14:25] of the congregation and when they came
[1:14:28] near onto the altar god is telling moses
[1:14:31] this
[1:14:33] when it's time to go to church
[1:14:37] i want all the priests
[1:14:40] and the high priest before they enter
[1:14:43] the church
[1:14:45] they must stop
[1:14:47] at the level
[1:14:48] and they must wash their hand
[1:14:51] and wash their feet
[1:14:53] then they enter the church
[1:14:55] if they enter in the church without
[1:14:58] washing their hand and the feet i will
[1:15:00] kill them
[1:15:03] why not taking a bath
[1:15:06] why only
[1:15:08] this hallelujah
[1:15:11] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:13] let's get into the myth now
[1:15:16] in hebrew chapter eight verse two the
[1:15:18] bible say a minister of the sanctuary
[1:15:22] and the true tabernacle
[1:15:25] we are flipping to heaven now
[1:15:27] so we saw what moses did on the earth
[1:15:29] we're now going back to heaven
[1:15:32] which the lord peace and not a man
[1:15:35] so in heaven there is a tabernacle which
[1:15:37] god pitched himself on the earth there
[1:15:40] is a reflection of the tabernacle in
[1:15:42] heaven that moses pitched
[1:15:45] so on the earth here we found out that
[1:15:47] there is a pool called the level if
[1:15:49] there is a pull of the level in the
[1:15:52] earth there must be a pool in heaven
[1:15:55] because the earth only reflected heaven
[1:15:58] so let's go back in heaven see if there
[1:16:01] is a pool there
[1:16:04] hallelujah
[1:16:06] hebrew chapter 8 verse 5
[1:16:09] who served unto
[1:16:11] the example on shadow of heavenly things
[1:16:15] as moses was admonish of god when he was
[1:16:18] about to make the tabernacle
[1:16:20] foresee he said say he that that shall
[1:16:23] make all things according to the pattern
[1:16:26] show to thee in the mouth
[1:16:28] brother branham interpret this he said
[1:16:30] the sea of glass
[1:16:32] in heaven
[1:16:34] this ain't very much symbols here but i
[1:16:36] want to erase this for a minute now we
[1:16:38] want to study here just a little bit
[1:16:41] the sea of glass is symbolized in the
[1:16:44] old temple
[1:16:46] for moses was commanded of god to build
[1:16:49] the temple on earth like he saw in he
[1:16:53] saw it in the heaven but i'm here is
[1:16:55] telling us that what moses called the
[1:16:58] level here on earth
[1:17:00] in heaven
[1:17:01] it was called the sea of glass
[1:17:05] where is that sea of glass
[1:17:08] the bible says this and i'm going to get
[1:17:10] to brother branham face brother branham
[1:17:11] say
[1:17:12] sea of glass he was like an anti-crystal
[1:17:16] now the sea of glass is symbolized
[1:17:18] tapped by the brass sea now it's clear
[1:17:21] this is the glassy in heaven
[1:17:24] moses saw it as the glassy and made what
[1:17:28] was called the brass sea or the level he
[1:17:32] just reproduced that so from today
[1:17:34] heaven
[1:17:36] sea of glass earth level so when we move
[1:17:38] our camera you know where we go
[1:17:41] hey back here
[1:17:42] now let's look at this sea of glass in
[1:17:44] heaven revelation chapter 4 verse 1
[1:17:48] after this i look and behold the door
[1:17:51] was open in heaven brother branham
[1:17:53] referred here to the rapture
[1:17:56] because john was taken up
[1:17:58] and the first voice which i heard was as
[1:18:01] he were a trumpet talking to me which
[1:18:04] said come up even but i'm saying it's a
[1:18:06] top of the rapture church being raptured
[1:18:09] and i will surely
[1:18:11] which must he be hereafter verse five
[1:18:14] and out of the throne
[1:18:17] proceeded lightning and thundering
[1:18:21] before i move forward
[1:18:22] let me clarify here
[1:18:25] in this sanctuary here
[1:18:28] this holy place
[1:18:30] in this holy place here
[1:18:32] we have the candlestick right there
[1:18:36] everybody clear
[1:18:38] and we found out that the level is right
[1:18:40] here
[1:18:41] the candlestick is here when you go back
[1:18:44] all the way to the holy of holiest
[1:18:47] there we have the ark
[1:18:50] hey back here
[1:18:51] and on top of the ark we have the mercy
[1:18:54] seat between the caribbean which was the
[1:18:57] throne of god
[1:18:58] so we have a throne here
[1:19:00] back here
[1:19:02] and in the next
[1:19:04] room we have the candlestick ever clear
[1:19:08] and in the next room at the door you
[1:19:11] have the level
[1:19:13] so we have throne candlestick and level
[1:19:16] ever here
[1:19:17] let me go back now to revelation
[1:19:20] in revelation chapter 4 verse 5 and out
[1:19:23] of the throne
[1:19:25] remember now
[1:19:27] proceed lightning and thundering and
[1:19:30] voices this is a throne of judgment
[1:19:32] and there was seven lamps of fire
[1:19:35] burning before the throne everybody
[1:19:37] cares so far remember trump
[1:19:41] candlestick
[1:19:42] then level
[1:19:44] on the earth when we flip our camera up
[1:19:48] into heaven the first thing we found is
[1:19:50] a throne
[1:19:52] and before the throne is followed by the
[1:19:54] candlestick
[1:19:55] and well let's see after the candlestick
[1:19:58] what follows
[1:20:02] he said there were seven lamps of fire
[1:20:05] burning before the throne which are the
[1:20:07] seven spirit of god
[1:20:09] and before the throne there was a sea of
[1:20:13] glass like unto water
[1:20:15] so now in heaven each throne
[1:20:20] candlestick or lampstand
[1:20:22] then the sea of glass on the earth it is
[1:20:26] the throne in the holy of holies
[1:20:29] then the candlestick in the holy place
[1:20:31] then in the other chord it is the level
[1:20:34] throne candlestick level throne can the
[1:20:37] stick level why that order
[1:20:41] are we okay
[1:20:44] hope i didn't lose a wing
[1:20:46] on someone
[1:20:48] ever here
[1:20:50] brother brother say
[1:20:51] let me draw a little picture a little
[1:20:54] bit here now saying here was the ark of
[1:20:57] the old testament all right the next
[1:20:59] thing that was called the holy of holies
[1:21:03] and the next place here was the altar
[1:21:05] which was the holy place everybody clear
[1:21:07] now now you understand the coat of
[1:21:09] brother brother follow the order you
[1:21:11] have the holy earth
[1:21:12] you have the throne and then you have
[1:21:14] the candlestick then you have the level
[1:21:16] and right before here was the zebras
[1:21:19] it's called
[1:21:20] in other words it was a place
[1:21:23] where the sacrifice was
[1:21:26] washed where did you get that brother
[1:21:29] brother
[1:21:30] the bible says when you get there you
[1:21:32] only wash your hand
[1:21:34] and your feet
[1:21:35] now brother branham say not only were
[1:21:38] the priests washing their hand and their
[1:21:41] feet but the sacrifice also was washed
[1:21:44] there
[1:21:48] may lord help us if we can get to
[1:21:50] solomon because solomon split this and
[1:21:53] you're going to see the number
[1:21:55] anybody clear
[1:21:56] brother branham said it was a place
[1:21:58] where the sacrifice was washed
[1:22:01] here before it was received at the altar
[1:22:04] at the brass altar or the brazen altar
[1:22:07] where the sacrifice was burned so when
[1:22:08] you bring your sacrifice
[1:22:11] the priest will be standing there they
[1:22:13] take your offering
[1:22:15] wash it first then take it to the altar
[1:22:18] and kill it
[1:22:19] so that water was a preparation to the
[1:22:22] killing
[1:22:27] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:22:30] paragraph 157
[1:22:32] brother branham say in this sea of glass
[1:22:35] was before the throne that's heaven
[1:22:38] and before the holy place that's earth
[1:22:42] makes sense now
[1:22:44] just now remember the seven golden
[1:22:47] candlestick
[1:22:49] sat here like this
[1:22:51] and come in the level
[1:22:54] now that is the one reflect the light
[1:22:57] from the holy place out of here
[1:23:03] did you get it
[1:23:04] in heaven we have a throne
[1:23:07] then the candlestick
[1:23:09] damn the sea of glass on the earth we
[1:23:12] have the throne of god
[1:23:15] and then we have the candlestick then
[1:23:17] the level and brother branham said the
[1:23:20] candlestick have lights
[1:23:23] and those lights were lightened by the
[1:23:26] pillar of fire
[1:23:28] and the way they liked them when it
[1:23:30] leaked the first
[1:23:32] candlestick they take light they take
[1:23:35] fire from the first candlestick go to
[1:23:37] the second
[1:23:39] and they take the second to the third
[1:23:41] the third to the fourth the fourth to
[1:23:44] the fifth the fifth to the sixth the
[1:23:46] sixth to the seven in other words all
[1:23:48] those fires were one fire divided in
[1:23:51] seven
[1:23:52] and when you put the fire together you
[1:23:55] have the image of trust
[1:23:58] that's why the constellation came and
[1:24:00] brother branham called that the circle
[1:24:02] of fire
[1:24:04] he was the seventh spirit of god that
[1:24:06] walked through the seven church edges
[1:24:09] but the point here brother branham is
[1:24:11] saying is the light of those candles was
[1:24:14] shining through the sea
[1:24:18] anybody here
[1:24:19] so when we take water from the river we
[1:24:22] put it in the pool that water was
[1:24:25] changing by the reflection of the light
[1:24:28] [Applause]
[1:24:31] everybody here so when you get in that
[1:24:33] water and you look
[1:24:35] what you see reflecting there
[1:24:37] you are seeing the light from the
[1:24:39] candlestick
[1:24:41] and the light from the candlestick are
[1:24:44] only a reflection of the light from the
[1:24:47] throne
[1:24:48] so the throne reflects in the
[1:24:51] candlestick and the candlestick reflect
[1:24:55] in the sea of glass
[1:24:56] and when the worshiper comes he must be
[1:25:00] washed with that water where the star
[1:25:03] are reflecting
[1:25:05] no other water can put you in the
[1:25:08] presence of god but the water where your
[1:25:10] star is reflecting
[1:25:16] you say you're watching the river did
[1:25:18] you have a star there
[1:25:20] that's the star of the zodiac
[1:25:22] we want the reflection from the
[1:25:24] tabernacle you need to wash with the
[1:25:27] water appropriate for the start of your
[1:25:30] day where your star is washed is
[1:25:32] reflecting through the water that is the
[1:25:35] water that you need to be washed
[1:25:38] before you enter into the presence of
[1:25:40] god any other word that will kill you
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:45] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:25:47] did i lose anyone
[1:25:49] flight attendant they're all good
[1:25:51] prayer said be the name of the lord
[1:25:56] so let's blow up
[1:25:58] this sea
[1:25:59] of glass
[1:26:00] which is called the level
[1:26:02] what is this level
[1:26:04] let's make it easy
[1:26:06] brother branham say how do we come
[1:26:09] remind me on time brother child i'm
[1:26:11] already lost here
[1:26:13] he said how do we come
[1:26:16] we got to come this gentle church to
[1:26:19] this world
[1:26:24] which word come out
[1:26:26] sea of glass
[1:26:31] so the sea of gas is water
[1:26:34] what kind of world
[1:26:38] what kind of word is it
[1:26:41] he said we must come to this world
[1:26:44] the sea of glass
[1:26:46] water water of the world
[1:26:49] is that right
[1:26:50] recognize the word the word the way it's
[1:26:54] written
[1:26:56] then the sacrifice is received
[1:26:59] and filled with the holy gospel from the
[1:27:02] inside
[1:27:03] shining through the light of that edge
[1:27:07] here it comes out of the holy place into
[1:27:09] here out of the star into here so god
[1:27:13] reflecting the star
[1:27:15] and the star received the revelation of
[1:27:18] that day
[1:27:19] and he reflects that revelation in the
[1:27:22] sea of glass
[1:27:24] and the sea of glass once he reflects
[1:27:26] the star it becomes the water of life
[1:27:29] and then when you wash in the water god
[1:27:32] receive you and fill you with your
[1:27:34] spirit and you are candidate to enter
[1:27:37] the role of holism
[1:27:39] the mystery of the sea of glass
[1:27:45] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:27:48] now we understand
[1:27:49] that the sea of glass
[1:27:51] the priests come
[1:27:53] and they wash their extremities
[1:27:55] their hand
[1:27:57] and their feet
[1:27:58] and what brandon added to us that would
[1:28:00] they bring also the sacrifice and the
[1:28:03] wash
[1:28:04] so there is two things washing the
[1:28:06] priest hand
[1:28:07] fit before they enter into church
[1:28:10] and also washing the sacrifice
[1:28:13] very easy
[1:28:14] is there anymore brother child
[1:28:18] exodus chapter 40.
[1:28:20] the bible says
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:22] and
[1:28:24] shall anoint the level
[1:28:28] so the level
[1:28:30] itself
[1:28:31] had to be anointed
[1:28:34] it was not just any kind of level
[1:28:37] not any kind of word
[1:28:39] because we know it's crust it is the
[1:28:41] word but it must be the anointed word
[1:28:44] [Applause]
[1:28:47] everybody here the anointed word where
[1:28:50] the star of your edge is reflecting
[1:28:54] and that star is only reflecting christ
[1:28:57] because at the absence of this tongue
[1:28:59] that's when the star is working
[1:29:04] hallelujah
[1:29:05] anoint the lever and his foot there is a
[1:29:08] foundation one foot not two
[1:29:12] and sanctify it in other words
[1:29:14] consecrated
[1:29:16] and that shall bring aaron
[1:29:18] everybody follow me
[1:29:20] and his son
[1:29:22] unto the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:29:25] congregation what was at the door of the
[1:29:28] tabernacle the level
[1:29:30] the sea of glass
[1:29:32] bring arrow bring his son there
[1:29:35] what's wrong moses have they done
[1:29:37] something wrong
[1:29:38] no
[1:29:39] relax i'm gonna do something
[1:29:42] bring aaron and his son unto the door of
[1:29:45] the tabernacle of the congregation and

[1:35:49] government
[1:35:50] the high priest and anoint him
[1:35:54] and sanctify him
[1:35:56] consecrate him
[1:35:58] that he may minister
[1:36:00] unto me in the water
[1:36:03] in the priest's office
[1:36:08] in other words before aaron
[1:36:12] can exercise
[1:36:14] his elected
[1:36:16] predestinated
[1:36:18] position
[1:36:19] ministry
[1:36:21] he must first
[1:36:22] be washed in the lava
[1:36:26] and not only wash strip completely
[1:36:30] wash
[1:36:31] put a new garment and do what
[1:36:34] verse 13
[1:36:37] and that shall put upon aaron the holy
[1:36:40] government and do water
[1:36:42] and anoint him
[1:36:46] so when you put a new garment there is
[1:36:48] an anointing that is coming with that
[1:36:51] new government
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:53] maybe when aaron was coming he was tired
[1:36:56] and moses strip him and put him there
[1:36:59] and wash him and wash him and wash him
[1:37:01] he took a a towel

[1:37:07] he step him there bless him
[1:37:09] everything is good put a new garment
[1:37:12] bring the anointing on
[1:37:14] he brought the anointing on and pour on
[1:37:16] him as soon as the poor maybe aaron was
[1:37:19] like
[1:37:22] because david said it's like the
[1:37:24] anointing of aaron that jump into the
[1:37:27] all the way there
[1:37:28] maybe something get into error aaron
[1:37:30] begin to move a little bit like this
[1:37:32] moses said that's fun give him some time
[1:37:34] next one in line
[1:37:36] next morning
[1:37:38] ever clear
[1:37:39] so before
[1:37:41] the high priest exercised his ministry
[1:37:44] he must be washed in the liver
[1:37:48] dress
[1:37:49] at the level and anointed at the level
[1:37:53] then he's ready for ministry
[1:38:00] amen
[1:38:01] verse 14 and that shall bring his son
[1:38:07] and clothe them with coat
[1:38:09] so not only is the high priest
[1:38:12] washed
[1:38:14] dressed
[1:38:15] anointed but the family of the high
[1:38:19] priest all of them
[1:38:21] must go through the same order
[1:38:24] the same process and the same anointing
[1:38:31] verse 15 and that shall anoint them as
[1:38:35] that deed anoint their father same
[1:38:38] anointing
[1:38:39] not a different anointing only the level
[1:38:42] is different aaron is the high priest
[1:38:45] you are the children of the high priest
[1:38:47] but the anointing is the same
[1:38:51] everybody
[1:38:52] and anointed them as they did anoint
[1:38:55] their father that the minister unto me
[1:38:58] in the priest's office
[1:39:00] who's anointing aaron
[1:39:04] moses
[1:39:06] who was moses
[1:39:08] a prophet
[1:39:09] a vindicated prophet
[1:39:12] must anoint
[1:39:14] the first high priest
[1:39:16] that have to be introduced in the
[1:39:18] tabernacle of earth
[1:39:22] there is two tabernacles there is a
[1:39:24] tabernacle in heaven
[1:39:26] and there is a tabernacle on the earth
[1:39:28] the tabernacle on the earth require a
[1:39:31] high priest
[1:39:32] and to introduce the high priest
[1:39:35] you hear me to introduce the high priest
[1:39:38] there must be a vindicated prophet
[1:39:42] standing there
[1:39:43] to wash the high priest
[1:39:45] and wash him
[1:39:47] and rob him and anoint him then
[1:39:50] introduce the first high priest of the
[1:39:53] levitical priesthood was anointed washed
[1:39:58] and then dressed by a vindicated prophet
[1:40:02] and started the levitical principle
[1:40:09] verse 15
[1:40:11] for the anointing this anointing
[1:40:14] shall surely be an everlasting water
[1:40:19] so you telling me the levitical
[1:40:21] priesthood did not cease
[1:40:28] the levitical priesthood stop yes
[1:40:31] at the cross
[1:40:33] but the anointing god said it's
[1:40:35] everlasting
[1:40:37] that's why you need a prophet
[1:40:40] amen
[1:40:41] and for their anointing shall surely be
[1:40:44] an everlasting priesthood throughout
[1:40:46] their generation that's why brother
[1:40:48] branham explained those words forever
[1:40:50] it's for a time period
[1:40:52] because we know the levitical priesthood
[1:40:54] was only a reflection of something that
[1:40:57] happened in heaven
[1:40:58] [Applause]
[1:41:00] amen that was not the true tabernacle
[1:41:02] that was a copy the true tabernacle was
[1:41:05] in heaven but they placed an anointing
[1:41:08] and the one who was introduced as the
[1:41:10] first high priest
[1:41:13] was introduced by a prophet
[1:41:15] a prophet by the name of moses
[1:41:18] who was moses
[1:41:21] you're clear
[1:41:22] buckle up i'm searching a gps and sooner
[1:41:25] i'm going to head to the airport
[1:41:27] everybody
[1:41:29] number chapter
[1:41:30] 26 verse 58 these are
[1:41:34] the family of delivered
[1:41:37] the family of the libyanite remember the
[1:41:39] genealogy hold the message
[1:41:42] the family of the hebron
[1:41:45] the family of the malad
[1:41:47] the family of the mushad the family of
[1:41:51] the kuratite all of these are families
[1:41:54] of liver
[1:41:55] evol
[1:41:57] and koa
[1:41:58] begot ammon
[1:42:01] we clear that we tried to see moses
[1:42:04] to introduce the levitical priesthood
[1:42:07] the first high priest of the first
[1:42:09] tabernacle must be introduced by a
[1:42:12] vindicated prophet
[1:42:14] with a message that prophets must be in
[1:42:16] the wilderness
[1:42:18] come out of a wilderness with a
[1:42:20] vindicated message and that prophet was
[1:42:23] given the privilege to wash the high
[1:42:26] priest that had to start the levitical
[1:42:28] priesthood
[1:42:30] we okay
[1:42:32] koha begat emerald verse 59
[1:42:36] and the name of imran wife was yokebed
[1:42:41] we understand who is this now
[1:42:43] sister you can be this bad
[1:42:45] the daughter of liver
[1:42:49] so right here
[1:42:51] we understand that the mother
[1:42:53] of moses was delivered
[1:42:58] am i reading a different bible i don't
[1:43:00] want you to say brother stephen say
[1:43:02] the bible says brother branham said i'm
[1:43:04] putting everything on the screen
[1:43:07] so right here the father of moses was a
[1:43:10] liver
[1:43:13] the mother of moses was also a liver
[1:43:17] because young bed the daughter of liver
[1:43:20] whom her mother bear to liver in egypt
[1:43:24] and she bear unto amram aaron and moses
[1:43:29] and miriam their sister in other words
[1:43:31] amram marry his auntie
[1:43:35] exodus chapter six and emerald took him
[1:43:38] jochebed
[1:43:40] his father's what
[1:43:42] is that clear now
[1:43:44] his father's sister's wife and she bare
[1:43:47] him aaron and who moses
[1:43:50] so this prophet
[1:43:52] that must anoint the first high priest
[1:43:55] and wash the high priest and dress the
[1:43:58] high priest
[1:44:00] that prophet must be must have a father
[1:44:04] levitt
[1:44:06] to introduce a high priest
[1:44:13] hallelujah
[1:44:15] we're still looking at moses
[1:44:17] in first chronicle chapter 2 23 the
[1:44:21] bible says the sons of emran
[1:44:24] aaron and moses
[1:44:26] and aaron was separated
[1:44:29] that he should sanctify the most holy
[1:44:31] thing
[1:44:32] he and his son forever
[1:44:35] but we know there was a stop to that
[1:44:38] to burn incense before the lord to
[1:44:40] minister unto him and to bless his name
[1:44:44] forever
[1:44:45] now concerning moses the man of god his
[1:44:48] son were named after the tribe of water
[1:44:51] so moses himself was a liver
[1:44:55] he was a liver vindicated prophet his
[1:44:59] mother liver his father liver
[1:45:02] pure liver
[1:45:04] that's the man that washed the first
[1:45:06] high priest
[1:45:08] dressed the first high priest
[1:45:10] and introduced the first high priest
[1:45:14] in psalm 99 verse 6 the bible says
[1:45:17] moses and aaron among his worker so
[1:45:20] moses was not only a leaver
[1:45:23] not only a prophet but moses was also a
[1:45:26] priest
[1:45:30] so the first man that introduced the
[1:45:33] first high priest was a vindicated
[1:45:36] prophet
[1:45:37] was in the wilderness father liver
[1:45:40] mother liver himself a liver
[1:45:43] a priest
[1:45:47] he said moses and aaron among his
[1:45:50] priests and samuel among them that call
[1:45:53] upon his name
[1:45:54] yet samuel exercised the priest office
[1:45:57] anybody clear
[1:45:59] where are you going brother stephen
[1:46:01] what is the caliber of moses
[1:46:04] in number 12 verse 6 8
[1:46:06] and he said hear now my word if there be
[1:46:10] a prophet among you
[1:46:12] i the lord will make myself known unto
[1:46:15] him in a vision and will speak unto him
[1:46:18] in a dream
[1:46:19] my servant moses is not so
[1:46:22] who is faithful in all my house
[1:46:25] with him
[1:46:27] will i speak mouth to mouth
[1:46:30] so moses was not just an ordinary
[1:46:32] prophet he was a higher caliber prophet
[1:46:36] so to introduce the levitical priesthood
[1:46:40] the levitical priesthood
[1:46:42] he
[1:46:43] require a high priest
[1:46:45] but the high priest must be introduced
[1:46:48] by a high caliber prophet
[1:46:51] his father must be a liver his mother
[1:46:54] must be a liver
[1:46:56] he himself must be a liver
[1:46:58] and he also must be a priest to get the
[1:47:01] privilege to watch the levitical first
[1:47:03] high priest
[1:47:07] amen
[1:47:08] with him
[1:47:09] will i speak month to month even
[1:47:12] apparently and not in dark speeches in
[1:47:15] other words plain
[1:47:16] and the similarities of the lord shall
[1:47:18] he behold he can see god
[1:47:21] wherefore then were you not afraid to
[1:47:23] speak against my servant moses
[1:47:25] deuteronomy 20 18 18 i will raise them a
[1:47:29] prophet from among their brethren like
[1:47:31] unto who
[1:47:33] even christ have to come at the caliber
[1:47:36] of moses
[1:47:41] deuteronomy 34
[1:47:43] 10 and there arose not a prophet says in
[1:47:47] all israel like unto moses whom the lord
[1:47:50] knew face to face
[1:47:53] a vindicated high category prophet
[1:47:58] moses father liverpool
[1:48:00] mother liverpool he himself delivered
[1:48:03] and a priest himself was granted the
[1:48:06] privilege to introduce the first high
[1:48:08] priest of the levitical priesthood and
[1:48:11] he had the privilege to take the high
[1:48:13] priest and wash him
[1:48:15] and dress him
[1:48:16] and anoint him
[1:48:18] and introduce him to the service
[1:48:21] that's the tabernacle on the earth
[1:48:24] everybody
[1:48:26] let's flip ourselves to heaven
[1:48:29] you
[1:48:30] ready isaiah 6 1
[1:48:34] in the year
[1:48:36] that king uzziah died
[1:48:38] this is isaiah going to the temple i saw
[1:48:40] also the lord
[1:48:42] sitting upon a throne
[1:48:45] in heaven
[1:48:46] high and lift up
[1:48:48] and his train filled the temple the
[1:48:51] temple in heaven
[1:48:53] above it stood the seraphim
[1:48:57] each one had six wings with twenty he
[1:49:00] covered his face and with twenty he
[1:49:02] covered his feet and with twin he did
[1:49:05] fly
[1:49:06] verse five then i say wow is me
[1:49:10] for i am undone because i am a man of
[1:49:13] unclean lips
[1:49:14] and i dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:49:17] unclean lips for man eyes have seen the
[1:49:20] king the lord of hosts
[1:49:22] then flew one of the seraphim unto me
[1:49:25] having a live coat in his hand which he
[1:49:29] had taken from the tongue from off the
[1:49:31] altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[1:49:34] said lo this has touched their lips then
[1:49:37] iniquity is taken away and that sin
[1:49:39] purge
[1:49:42] when you enter in the tabernacle on the
[1:49:44] earth
[1:49:45] number one you must be washed one time
[1:49:48] number two once you are washed one time
[1:49:51] every time you go to church or to the
[1:49:54] tabernacle you must stop at the door and
[1:49:56] wash your feet and wash your hand in
[1:49:59] other words the priesthood delivered
[1:50:02] of the old testament were preparing the
[1:50:06] worshiper to enter into the presence of
[1:50:09] god
[1:50:10] and moses was given a commission not
[1:50:13] only to reproduce the furniture of the
[1:50:17] tabernacle in heaven but he must also
[1:50:20] reproduce the priesthood that was in
[1:50:23] heaven those priests were also in heaven
[1:50:27] because when isaiah entered heaven
[1:50:30] he found himself unclean
[1:50:32] so a priest in heaven must move quickly
[1:50:35] and take the cause and purify him
[1:50:37] quickly before he accessed god so what
[1:50:40] was what the levat were doing in heaven
[1:50:43] that's what the seraphim were they are
[1:50:46] what the levite were doing on the earth
[1:50:48] that's what the seraphim were doing in
[1:50:51] heaven
[1:50:56] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:50:58] branham says this
[1:51:01] isaiah was a prophet so he goes down to
[1:51:03] the temple and he saw a real example
[1:51:08] god because what was on the earth was a
[1:51:10] reflection
[1:51:11] not the heavenly seraphim as they flew
[1:51:14] through the temple now a seraphim is a
[1:51:17] mighty word
[1:51:19] it is not an angel
[1:51:20] but what it is it is a sacrifice burner
[1:51:24] who was burning the sacrifice on earth
[1:51:27] the priest in heaven the seraphim so the
[1:51:30] priests of heaven are the seraphim so
[1:51:33] moses not only did he reflect the
[1:51:36] furniture he also reflect the priesthood
[1:51:39] in heaven so if there is a priesthood in
[1:51:42] heaven there must be also a high priest
[1:51:44] in heaven
[1:51:48] are we coming okay
[1:51:50] yeah the airplane is doing this
[1:51:52] amen
[1:51:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:51:56] but it's a sacrifice burner
[1:51:58] he has something to do with the
[1:52:01] atonement because he offered the
[1:52:03] sacrifice to make a way for the repented
[1:52:07] who
[1:52:08] sinner
[1:52:09] to the throne of water
[1:52:11] just like the priests on the earth
[1:52:13] prepare you to enter to the presence of
[1:52:16] god in heaven there must be a priest to
[1:52:19] prepare you to enter in the tabernacle
[1:52:22] not preached by men but the lord himself
[1:52:24] pitched
[1:52:28] amen
[1:52:29] what a position
[1:52:31] higher than angel greater than an angel
[1:52:34] for the edges stand back but the
[1:52:36] seraphim goes forward with the offering
[1:52:39] right in the presence of god a burner
[1:52:42] they offer the prayer
[1:52:44] that has been made the burner of the
[1:52:48] sacrifice
[1:52:49] so there is a reflection of a priesthood
[1:52:51] over there
[1:52:52] now
[1:52:53] the seraphim is the burner of the
[1:52:55] sacrifice which is one of the highest
[1:52:58] order of angel
[1:53:00] they are next to the caribbean those are
[1:53:02] in the throne
[1:53:03] there he was angels and then seraphim
[1:53:07] and then caribou the seraphim is
[1:53:09] actually the burner of the sacrifice
[1:53:12] making the way for the sinners approach
[1:53:16] a real high order of holiness in the
[1:53:18] temple of who god
[1:53:20] that's why when when isaiah entered
[1:53:23] there he found himself he said wow unto
[1:53:25] me i'm a man of a clean lip
[1:53:28] because he's in heaven
[1:53:30] a seraphim flew quickly and say this is
[1:53:32] the seed of abraham he can get killed
[1:53:34] quickly bring the stuff
[1:53:37] sanctify him when he sanctify him he
[1:53:39] stand in the presence of god god say who
[1:53:41] do i send he's saying now i'm ready
[1:53:44] because he was sanctified by a seraphim
[1:53:47] when you sanctify on the earth name you
[1:53:49] ready for the ministry
[1:53:52] hallelujah
[1:53:55] in the message influence brother branham
[1:53:56] say seraphim it means burner the word
[1:54:00] seraphim means which is next to the
[1:54:02] altar actually the seraphim is the one
[1:54:04] who received the sacrifice you see that
[1:54:07] and cleans the
[1:54:09] worshiper they leave out of heaven
[1:54:12] and then present him to god the seraphim
[1:54:15] does
[1:54:16] this seraphim was angelic beings in a
[1:54:19] high order and they are the very next
[1:54:21] one to god right at the altar they
[1:54:23] receive the sacrifice it shows the
[1:54:26] justice of god that sin cannot come in
[1:54:29] his presence unless it has been atoned
[1:54:31] for
[1:54:34] amen blessed be the name of the lord the
[1:54:38] vision of the temple
[1:54:40] he saw god upon his throne lift up
[1:54:43] and not the heavenly seraphim which
[1:54:46] means burner a special designated person
[1:54:50] in heaven
[1:54:51] influence the seraphim there are not
[1:54:54] angels they are supposed to be the
[1:54:56] sacrifice burner to plead the way for
[1:55:00] the guilty
[1:55:02] and they were sacrificed
[1:55:04] burner in other words the seraphim were
[1:55:07] the leaver of the heaven
[1:55:10] now we got two priesthood
[1:55:13] two temple the temple on the earth
[1:55:15] temple in heaven priesthood on the earth
[1:55:18] pursued on heaven now we got a high
[1:55:20] priest on the earth introduced by a
[1:55:22] mighty prophet father
[1:55:25] mother never he himself a priest
[1:55:27] let's see now do we have a high priest
[1:55:30] in heaven
[1:55:31] if we do have him who must introduce him
[1:55:37] now let's change the dispensation from
[1:55:40] the levitical to the correct high priest
[1:55:43] because that was a shadow
[1:55:46] zechariah and he showed me joshua the
[1:55:48] high priest
[1:55:50] standing before the angel of the lord
[1:55:52] hey
[1:55:54] and satan standing at his right hand to
[1:55:56] resist him
[1:55:58] and joshua was clothed with filthy
[1:56:00] garment
[1:56:01] on the earth he was a high priest when
[1:56:03] he entered in the true tabernacle
[1:56:06] everything is filthy remember on the
[1:56:08] earth when you come you come with filthy
[1:56:09] government moses destroy it put it in a
[1:56:11] trash they got to give you a new one in
[1:56:13] heaven the same thing must happen
[1:56:18] amen
[1:56:19] joshua was club with filthy government
[1:56:22] stood before the angel verse 4 and he
[1:56:24] answered and speak unto those that stood
[1:56:26] before him they were a priesthood in
[1:56:28] heaven
[1:56:30] saying take away the filthy garment from
[1:56:33] him
[1:56:35] so what moses was doing here was only a
[1:56:38] reflection over there
[1:56:40] and unto him unto him he said behold i
[1:56:44] have caused that iniquity to pass from
[1:56:46] thee and i will clothe thee with a
[1:56:49] change of garment
[1:56:50] so when you're coming from your family
[1:56:52] on the earth they gotta strip you off
[1:56:54] take it off give you new garment it was
[1:56:56] only a reflection of what was happening
[1:56:59] in heaven when you enter into heaven you
[1:57:01] see another priesthood when they see you
[1:57:03] filthy government they gotta wash you up
[1:57:05] take everything away and bring you a new
[1:57:08] clothe because you got to enter the
[1:57:10] presence of god if not you're going to
[1:57:11] be killed
[1:57:12] but clear so far
[1:57:14] we're connecting the dot
[1:57:15] so heading straight to the airport
[1:57:17] amen
[1:57:19] amen
[1:57:20] and then verse 5 and i said let them the
[1:57:24] priesthood set a fair mitchell
[1:57:26] because he was a high priest upon his
[1:57:28] head and they the priesthood in heaven
[1:57:31] set a fair meeting upon his head matter
[1:57:35] upon his head and clothed him with
[1:57:37] garment and the angel of the lord stood
[1:57:39] by him and the angel of the lord
[1:57:41] protested unto joshua now the word
[1:57:44] commanded unto joshua saying
[1:57:47] that save the lord of hosts if that will
[1:57:49] work in my ways he's talking to a
[1:57:51] levitical high priest if you walk in my
[1:57:53] way and if that keep my charge then that
[1:57:56] shall also judge my house and shall also
[1:57:59] keep my cord and i will give the places
[1:58:01] to walk among these that stand by
[1:58:05] the priest of heaven
[1:58:06] okay
[1:58:07] the levitical of heaven
[1:58:10] here now oh joshua the high priest
[1:58:13] that and that fellow that sit before
[1:58:15] thee for their men wonder that
[1:58:18] for behold i will bring forth my servant
[1:58:22] the branch
[1:58:25] he have just cleaned the high priest on
[1:58:27] earth
[1:58:28] he finished with him but he looked at
[1:58:31] joshua he said joshua
[1:58:33] even though you're there
[1:58:35] even though you're a high priest i'm
[1:58:37] going to tell you a secret
[1:58:38] i'm going to send somebody who's called
[1:58:40] the branch
[1:58:42] he will be coming
[1:58:44] who is the branch
[1:58:45] if the prophetical priesthood was
[1:58:47] forever why do we need again another
[1:58:51] priesthood
[1:58:55] hallelujah
[1:58:56] blessed be the name of the lord hebrew
[1:58:58] 10 for the lord having a shadow
[1:59:02] of good things to come and not the very
[1:59:06] image
[1:59:07] of the thing just a shadow
[1:59:10] can never
[1:59:12] with those sacrifices which they offer
[1:59:14] year by year continually make they come
[1:59:18] there on to perfection
[1:59:21] so even though everything moses did was
[1:59:24] a reflection a replica of heaven yet
[1:59:28] perfection could never be achieved by
[1:59:31] the levitical pursuit we need something
[1:59:34] better
[1:59:35] something higher something that not only
[1:59:38] is going to clean the worship
[1:59:40] naturally but it's going to claim him
[1:59:43] also spiritually because joshua
[1:59:46] naturally was clean but when he entered
[1:59:48] in the presence of god they found him
[1:59:50] with filthy government
[1:59:52] isaiah was a good prophet when he
[1:59:54] entered in the tabernacle of god they
[1:59:57] found him he was a man with unclean lips
[2:00:00] so what was going there was not enough
[2:00:03] you need somebody that when when you
[2:00:06] enter heaven god cannot find even a spot
[2:00:10] god will check you up turn you up turn
[2:00:12] you down you say which speeches are you
[2:00:14] coming in everybody that gets here found
[2:00:16] fault but which which which caliber are
[2:00:18] you in
[2:00:19] you need somebody that can pass your god
[2:00:25] you need a priesthood that when it
[2:00:27] washes you god himself cannot find a
[2:00:30] spot or a wicklow
[2:00:33] you can give god all eternity you say
[2:00:35] father keep searching on eternity if
[2:00:37] you're gonna find one thing and god
[2:00:39] searching all eternity and he comes back
[2:00:42] to you he said i found no fault in you
[2:00:45] that's the priest we need
[2:00:47] [Applause]
[2:00:51] you want me stop here
[2:00:54] you heard them deacon
[2:00:58] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:01:00] hallelujah hebrews 7 verse 19 the bible
[2:01:04] say for the lord made water
[2:01:09] nothing perfect
[2:01:11] as much as we appreciate the law
[2:01:14] he made nothing perfect but the bringing
[2:01:17] it off a water
[2:01:19] the law was only telling you
[2:01:22] the real deal is coming
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:26] i cannot let you comfortless like this
[2:01:29] let me give you a substitute to kind of
[2:01:32] calm your nerves down but hold on there
[2:01:34] is coming an appointed time where the
[2:01:37] real deal is coming and when that deal
[2:01:39] comes it will never be changing
[2:01:42] [Applause]
[2:01:43] hallelujah
[2:01:44] but bringing in a better hope by day
[2:01:48] which we draw night to water because
[2:01:51] unto the law yet the people could not
[2:01:53] access god
[2:01:54] you heard it yesterday they have to put
[2:01:57] like a band on a high priest to keep
[2:01:59] listening for him
[2:02:01] all the time
[2:02:02] and if he's dead oh my god get the next
[2:02:04] one and the next one is trembling
[2:02:06] already because the first one is already
[2:02:07] dead

[2:02:44] hey harry hurry
[2:02:47] too much
[2:02:49] we need a high priest
[2:02:50] that enter not every year
[2:02:54] just once

[2:02:58] and then my righteousness is laying on
[2:03:00] him

[2:03:06] and you can go your way and if you ask
[2:03:08] me i say look at him
[2:03:15] oh my god
[2:03:17] is the time okay
[2:03:20] oh my god
[2:03:22] amen
[2:03:23] now
[2:03:24] in hebrews 7 the bible says this and
[2:03:28] verily they that are the son of liver
[2:03:32] who received the office of the
[2:03:34] priesthood
[2:03:35] has a commandment to take death
[2:03:37] of the people according to the law that
[2:03:40] is of their brethren though they come
[2:03:43] out of the loans of abraham
[2:03:45] and he whose descent is not counted from
[2:03:49] them received path of abraham and bless
[2:03:53] him that has the promise
[2:03:55] so one day abraham went to fight
[2:03:57] when he was coming up he saw somebody
[2:04:00] coming up to meet him
[2:04:02] abraham when he looked at him he said ah
[2:04:05] this is a strange man
[2:04:07] i know who you are wait a minute uh
[2:04:11] check my bank account i have been
[2:04:13] working for the whole year i have not
[2:04:15] paid my tax quickly
[2:04:17] quickly who told abraham he need to pay
[2:04:19] his tax
[2:04:23] who taught abraham
[2:04:25] who taught abraham abraham went and took
[2:04:28] everything and said
[2:04:30] here this is my thought
[2:04:32] he took the attack
[2:04:34] so the attack
[2:04:36] was not really to the levitical
[2:04:38] priesthood the thought was supposed to
[2:04:40] go in another pressure
[2:04:44] but because he's not there
[2:04:47] he said who is delivered on earth
[2:04:52] is there a liver there
[2:04:53] in lama ohio do we have a liver
[2:04:56] since i'm not there
[2:04:58] you as my representative because i am
[2:05:01] the chief shepherd
[2:05:02] you are the shepherd
[2:05:04] you as my representative
[2:05:06] i don't do i don't have anything to do
[2:05:08] with it you take the money so when they
[2:05:10] give you they actually doing that to me
[2:05:14] normally we should all go to heaven
[2:05:17] and go and knock and say i come this is
[2:05:19] my paycheck and go back there he said no
[2:05:22] no no i don't want you here bothering me
[2:05:24] with time i'll put somebody there when
[2:05:27] you work you're working more overtime
[2:05:29] make sure you bring everything and give
[2:05:31] to the man called
[2:05:32] chad lamb over there
[2:05:34] when you give it to him me in heaven i
[2:05:36] will check you that he gave it to me
[2:05:39] bless him
[2:05:42] so if you have not been paying your time
[2:05:44] make sure you clear that up
[2:05:48] ever clear
[2:05:50] he didn't tell me to preach on them
[2:05:54] everybody clear so far
[2:05:56] and without your contradiction verse
[2:05:59] seven the less that's why to relax you
[2:06:02] so you can soak more
[2:06:04] the less is blessed of the baby and here
[2:06:07] men that died
[2:06:09] received death but he that receiveth
[2:06:12] them of whom it is witness that he
[2:06:14] leaves and as amazon say liver also who
[2:06:19] received path
[2:06:21] paid us in who
[2:06:23] how did liverpool in abraham
[2:06:27] why was he only recognized to liver
[2:06:29] because the priest would have to come
[2:06:30] there
[2:06:31] anybody here
[2:06:33] for he was yet in the launch of abraham
[2:06:36] when
[2:06:37] melchizedek meet him
[2:06:40] so we found a man here come and kiss
[2:06:44] and he's dealing with darling
[2:06:47] and we know taving we give it to church
[2:06:50] why did abraham give tithing to this man
[2:06:53] call melchizedek
[2:06:55] amen
[2:06:56] the problem is that a vertical
[2:06:59] priesthood cannot bring nothing to
[2:07:01] perfection
[2:07:02] and god gave joshua the high priest a
[2:07:05] promise he said i am going to send the
[2:07:07] branch
[2:07:09] the branch will come
[2:07:10] and we found a man here come and kiss
[2:07:13] that with our father
[2:07:15] with our mother without beginning of
[2:07:17] death without ending of life how can you
[2:07:19] kill somebody like that
[2:07:23] how can you kill
[2:07:24] him if you notice when abraham gave him
[2:07:27] tithe he there he never ate
[2:07:30] he was the one that gave abraham
[2:07:32] something to eat not him
[2:07:34] he ate in genesis 18
[2:07:36] when he
[2:07:37] he he wore the body of him
[2:07:41] that's when he ate pork chop
[2:07:43] he was not a vegetarian sorry you can
[2:07:45] continue on your salad
[2:07:49] everybody so far
[2:07:51] anybody cares so far so we needed a new
[2:07:54] pursue the levitical priesthood
[2:07:56] is already done away it's not working
[2:07:59] the worshiper come and worship god they
[2:08:02] leave but he's still struggling with the
[2:08:04] same desire he said god i don't know i
[2:08:07] don't know should i shoot myself for
[2:08:09] what
[2:08:10] i say i'm not going to do this again and
[2:08:12] i keep doing this again i keep doing
[2:08:13] this again are you doing this again
[2:08:16] i finished all my limbs over there i
[2:08:18] have 30. i already finished 20 because
[2:08:20] i've seen 20 times
[2:08:24] we need something better
[2:08:26] we need something better but that which
[2:08:28] came to abraham is a tea orphan
[2:08:32] it is working but he cannot eat
[2:08:35] if you take a knife you poke him
[2:08:38] nothing
[2:08:39] if you say melchizedek i am hurt
[2:08:42] he doesn't understand
[2:08:45] you can touch him like this melchizedek
[2:08:47] you won't say
[2:08:49] you can punch him you won't say ouch
[2:08:52] can you say mercedes i had a headache
[2:08:56] a headache
[2:08:58] how does he work
[2:09:01] you say no no my nerve i can't sleep
[2:09:03] melchizedek is looking because he never
[2:09:05] sleeps no slumber he's looking at you
[2:09:08] you have insomnia you can sleep
[2:09:11] okay
[2:09:12] what is going on
[2:09:13] you see the the i went and the doctor
[2:09:16] say this melchizedek is still looking
[2:09:19] say
[2:09:20] yeah i understand i feel sorry for you
[2:09:22] but i can't really feel what you're
[2:09:24] saying can you please explain me more
[2:09:27] you say melchizedek when he hurt you
[2:09:29] know when i do this
[2:09:30] i can't really feel it like he said they
[2:09:32] said what is this
[2:09:36] so we needed something that when i tell
[2:09:38] him he hurt he knows
[2:09:41] when i tell him it's headache he
[2:09:42] understand headache
[2:09:44] when i pinch him he's gonna say ouch the
[2:09:47] same way i say ouch
[2:09:50] if i fall he falls
[2:09:52] because my kisser they can appear and
[2:09:54] disappear
[2:09:55] but me i cannot disappear if i go right
[2:09:57] there i'm gonna hit the wall
[2:09:59] i need somebody who can hit the world
[2:10:02] like me but that person must be god
[2:10:11] brother branham said god could not
[2:10:13] suffer in the spirit
[2:10:17] he had to become flesh
[2:10:19] to feel the pain of sickness
[2:10:23] to feel the temptation of lust
[2:10:26] to feel the temptation of want
[2:10:29] to feel the temptation of hunger to feel
[2:10:32] the temptation of the power of death
[2:10:34] that he might take it upon himself to
[2:10:37] stand in the presence of the great
[2:10:39] spirit jehovah
[2:10:41] the spirit not the man the spirit to
[2:10:43] make intercession to this life and jesus
[2:10:46] took that
[2:10:48] in order to make intercession for us
[2:10:51] for he knows how he feels
[2:10:55] when you get sick
[2:10:56] he knows how you feel when you are
[2:10:58] tempted he knows how you feel we needed
[2:11:02] a better sacrifice a better priesthood
[2:11:07] oh my god
[2:11:08] god
[2:11:09] coming down to become man
[2:11:11] to die god could not die as a spirit he
[2:11:15] could not die he is eternal and he could
[2:11:17] not die but god could make himself in
[2:11:20] such a way that he could feel pain that
[2:11:23] he could feel and suffer god could not
[2:11:26] suffer as the eternal spirit but when he
[2:11:29] become man he could suffer
[2:11:32] he could feel the pain the temptation
[2:11:35] that man went through like adam and eve
[2:11:38] in the garden of eden and everyone sees
[2:11:40] so there is why do we want god to feel
[2:11:44] pain
[2:11:46] why should the high priest feel pain why
[2:11:51] take your bible to hebrew
[2:11:53] probably i'm gonna cut up here then
[2:11:55] we'll pick up on sunday
[2:11:59] let's go to hebrew
[2:12:01] hallelujah
[2:12:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:12:05] let's go to hebrew chapter 5.
[2:12:10] then i'm going to stop
[2:12:11] somewhere here then we'll pick it up
[2:12:14] hebrew chapter 5.
[2:12:18] that's why i call it part one
[2:12:23] if you dare you can say amen
[2:12:31] hebrew chapter five if everybody is
[2:12:32] there you can say amen
[2:12:34] verse one
[2:12:35] for every high priest
[2:12:38] taken from man
[2:12:40] is ordained for who
[2:12:42] for man in things pertain to god
[2:12:46] that he may offer both gift
[2:12:49] and sacrifice for sin
[2:12:52] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[2:12:57] the requirement of a high priest he must
[2:13:01] understand the ignorant brother marcus
[2:13:07] whence everybody say pastor put him in
[2:13:10] the hand of the devil he must be there
[2:13:12] to film that person and say maybe he
[2:13:14] didn't mean that
[2:13:20] because the law was quickly take the
[2:13:23] stone
[2:13:25] and let's go
[2:13:27] when they came to the true high priest
[2:13:30] they brought a woman they said
[2:13:32] there is no argument we have her tape
[2:13:35] we recorded her she committed adultery
[2:13:38] we have the dna all we want is apply
[2:13:41] moses
[2:13:42] jesus said no problem be very easy
[2:13:47] do you have a pen
[2:13:49] sat down on the pill
[2:13:53] they said did you hear us
[2:13:55] we want to hear from you
[2:13:58] you say any of you
[2:14:00] who have not seen
[2:14:02] be the first one
[2:14:04] you who are perfect
[2:14:06] okay you who are perfect
[2:14:08] you didn't cheat your wife you didn't
[2:14:10] steal you didn't do all of this you are
[2:14:12] perfect
[2:14:13] take one thing because the rich young
[2:14:15] ruler thought he was perfect
[2:14:17] only christ could reveal his weakness he
[2:14:20] had a problem with giving money to the
[2:14:22] poor
[2:14:25] amen he said you who are perfect take
[2:14:28] the first son cuts to this woman
[2:14:30] and jesus continued
[2:14:33] and then this one remember
[2:14:35] i cheated
[2:14:37] this one remember
[2:14:39] i just got into a fight yesterday
[2:14:42] this one remember and when jesus
[2:14:44] finished
[2:14:44] say woman
[2:14:46] empty the whole church empty
[2:14:50] so now i'm dealing with a prostitute in
[2:14:52] the church
[2:14:55] say go
[2:14:56] that's the priest we need
[2:14:58] he can understand the ignorance
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:04] hallelujah
[2:15:06] verse two who can have compassion on
[2:15:09] their ignorant
[2:15:10] and on them that are out of the way
[2:15:14] so when you come to the high priest the
[2:15:17] high priest when you bring him a sinner
[2:15:21] there is something built in the high
[2:15:23] priest that he understands that sinner
[2:15:26] in a different way
[2:15:28] are you looking at is that drunk or over
[2:15:31] there he cast me the last time i stopped
[2:15:33] at the gas station to get the guys
[2:15:35] that's you when you bring him to the
[2:15:36] high priest the hype we say praise be
[2:15:38] the name of the lord we got a soul for
[2:15:41] christ bring him in bring him in quickly
[2:15:44] to the oil oh bring him in to the door
[2:15:46] of the tabernacle i got a lover here
[2:15:49] bring him in you say not this one he
[2:15:51] cheated me yesterday he cast me like
[2:15:53] whisper bringing me come in with him
[2:15:56] just the way no no no he need to repent
[2:15:57] to me for the high priest leave him
[2:15:59] alone just the way he is bring him i
[2:16:01] have a trash can here
[2:16:03] when he come i know how to strip him
[2:16:06] and i know how to watch him and i know
[2:16:08] how to introduce him a high priest that
[2:16:10] can understand that
[2:16:15] hallelujah
[2:16:16] he said who can understand them that are
[2:16:18] out of the way
[2:16:20] for that he himself
[2:16:23] also is what
[2:16:25] compass with infirmities
[2:16:27] he suffer himself
[2:16:29] he understands that even though i'm
[2:16:31] going into the holy of holies yet
[2:16:34] i am not really qualified
[2:16:37] i'm only entering there by grace so he
[2:16:40] can understand the other one so if god
[2:16:43] stay make he's a deck he still don't
[2:16:45] understand
[2:16:46] so they gotta take god and make god in a
[2:16:49] way that god can feel pain
[2:16:55] to the point that god can be looking at
[2:16:57] the tree that he created to find if he
[2:16:59] can have food
[2:17:01] instead of him speaking and having a a
[2:17:03] good hamburger he need to go also like
[2:17:06] me and look at the tree
[2:17:07] he have to suffer hunger
[2:17:11] then he's going to be a better high
[2:17:12] priest
[2:17:15] verse three and by reason harry of
[2:17:18] hereof he should as for the people so
[2:17:22] also for himself to offer for the sin
[2:17:25] and no man take this honor to himself
[2:17:28] but he that is called of god
[2:17:30] as was aaron
[2:17:32] so
[2:17:33] also christ's glorify not himself
[2:17:37] brother robert to be made a high priest
[2:17:43] but he does say to him you are my son
[2:17:47] today i have begotten you
[2:17:51] as he said also in another place you are
[2:17:55] a priest forever after the order of who
[2:17:59] now we got to order
[2:18:01] we got the levitical order now we got
[2:18:03] melchizedek order the problem with
[2:18:06] melchizedek
[2:18:07] it's a heavenly order he cannot feel
[2:18:10] pain
[2:18:11] so we gotta take that order and immorph
[2:18:14] that order
[2:18:15] enemorphin bring him down condescend
[2:18:18] that order until that order can become
[2:18:21] flesh
[2:18:24] are you there
[2:18:25] that's where keonosis and morphe have to
[2:18:28] enter in place
[2:18:29] to take the eternal god the eternal man
[2:18:33] the eternal one that feel all time space
[2:18:36] and eternity god have to humble himself
[2:18:40] have to be leader himself have to take
[2:18:43] on him not the form of an angel by the
[2:18:46] form of a man as a form of the son the
[2:18:50] children of abraham so he can suffer
[2:18:52] like me
[2:18:53] [Music]
[2:18:56] hallelujah
[2:18:58] let's go to hebrew 2.
[2:19:00] and i'm going to stop
[2:19:02] amen
[2:19:05] hebrew two if you dare you can say amen
[2:19:10] hebrew two verse nine
[2:19:12] but we see jesus
[2:19:14] who was made
[2:19:16] a little lower than the water
[2:19:19] he was the creator of the angel
[2:19:24] because the spirit cannot feel pain
[2:19:27] now he has to be made lower than the
[2:19:29] angel
[2:19:31] but to make himself lower than the angel
[2:19:33] he must go through chemosis any morphe
[2:19:38] in my faith
[2:19:39] means he's changing one form to another
[2:19:46] in
[2:19:54] means
[2:19:55] that god is moving from one form
[2:20:00] into another form
[2:20:02] so if he was here invisible
[2:20:06] invisible in a morphe he becomes visible
[2:20:10] about here
[2:20:11] so immorphy is just saying changing a
[2:20:15] form
[2:20:16] changing of form ever here
[2:20:19] but a morphe was not sufficient
[2:20:23] because god was a spirit and nobody can
[2:20:27] see god
[2:20:28] ever if god flips and you see him
[2:20:34] what are you gonna how are you gonna see
[2:20:36] him
[2:20:37] are you seeing the reflection of god or
[2:20:40] are you seeing god himself
[2:20:42] anybody care so to make sure
[2:20:45] whoever because the bible said the only
[2:20:47] begotten of god in other words god
[2:20:51] was the eternal spirit
[2:20:54] then god birthed himself
[2:20:57] bless god
[2:21:02] are you there
[2:21:04] because god as the eternal spirit was
[2:21:06] locked
[2:21:07] but thank god in the bosom of the father
[2:21:11] in the bosom of god there was an
[2:21:13] attribute called the logos
[2:21:16] are you there
[2:21:18] and the logos meant the fullness of god
[2:21:23] so when god took the logos out of him
[2:21:27] and pulled the logos out
[2:21:30] the logos look back
[2:21:32] a god and say do you know what
[2:21:35] my meaning is
[2:21:37] god said yes he said me i'm all god
[2:21:41] so because i'm out i must suck you god
[2:21:44] into me
[2:21:48] did you hear me
[2:21:50] when we say poor
[2:21:52] brother when i'm explaining that it is
[2:21:54] not like you take water
[2:21:56] from a butter and you pour that in the
[2:21:59] glass that's not the god
[2:22:01] but here you take the bottle itself
[2:22:05] and the water
[2:22:06] and the top and the level you take
[2:22:09] everything and you put it in the glass
[2:22:12] ever clear so when the logos was coming
[2:22:16] out of god as a baby the lord god took
[2:22:19] god and sucked him into himself
[2:22:23] everybody here that process is called
[2:22:25] kenosis
[2:22:27] kinases is what made the pillar of fire
[2:22:31] god
[2:22:32] keynosis means what you start with is
[2:22:35] exactly what you end up with if you
[2:22:37] start with god you're gonna end up with
[2:22:40] god so he not only more faith he also
[2:22:44] kind of sees
[2:22:45] [Applause]
[2:22:47] everybody here so when he kind of says
[2:22:50] he become the pillar of fire still
[2:22:53] mystical
[2:22:55] we see a fire walking
[2:22:57] talking to moses talking to moses moses
[2:23:00] say
[2:23:01] i'm sorry can i say something
[2:23:03] he said talk
[2:23:04] say i'm tired
[2:23:06] every day i'm hearing you can i see you
[2:23:09] yes
[2:23:10] how can we be friend and never even see
[2:23:12] your face
[2:23:14] all i see is the light moving
[2:23:16] you say moses
[2:23:19] step there on the cleft of the rock
[2:23:22] moses stepped and suddenly he show him
[2:23:26] what he said oh
[2:23:28] he looks like me
[2:23:30] it's like a man
[2:23:32] it's like a man
[2:23:33] [Applause]
[2:23:35] when he want to approach he said no no
[2:23:37] no no no moses don't approach take your
[2:23:39] feet take your shoes
[2:23:41] stay back stand back stand back would
[2:23:43] you say
[2:23:44] still have a problem
[2:23:46] we still have a problem
[2:23:48] but how are we going to take this being
[2:23:49] and put it in human flesh
[2:23:52] amen
[2:23:54] let me head to the airport
[2:23:59] how can you handle this brother
[2:24:04] amen
[2:24:06] verse 9 and we see jesus who was made a
[2:24:09] little lower than angel for to suffer of
[2:24:12] the death because in the beginning was
[2:24:15] the word and the word was with god logos
[2:24:19] and that word was god
[2:24:21] and that word was made fresh
[2:24:24] because hebrew 10 7 say sacrifice an
[2:24:27] offering you don't want but you made me
[2:24:30] a body
[2:24:32] now they draw the eternal dwelling
[2:24:35] spirit can condescend down and dwell
[2:24:39] into a man
[2:24:40] so when you shake jesus hand you shaking
[2:24:42] the hand of god when you're talking to
[2:24:45] jesus you're talking to god if you push
[2:24:47] jesus you're pushing god
[2:24:50] [Applause]
[2:24:53] god
[2:24:54] now can be hurt
[2:24:57] god now can suffer
[2:25:00] god now can have headache
[2:25:02] god now can have pain
[2:25:06] now
[2:25:07] we got a good high priest
[2:25:09] now you can understand me so when i'm
[2:25:11] talking we have on the same language
[2:25:14] have you seen two sister talking about
[2:25:17] pregnancy the men are sitting there back
[2:25:20] because he doesn't understand the sister
[2:25:22] is saying he hurt and then i could not
[2:25:25] sleep i'm going this the man out there
[2:25:27] they can explain you all you want you
[2:25:28] would never understand until you're a
[2:25:30] woman
[2:25:35] you heard it
[2:25:37] amen
[2:25:38] amen
[2:25:40] clone him with glory and him by grace by
[2:25:44] the grace of god should taste death for
[2:25:46] every man
[2:25:47] for he becomes him
[2:25:50] for whom all things and by whom all
[2:25:53] things in bringing many son to glory to
[2:25:55] make the captain of their salvation
[2:25:58] perfect through water
[2:26:01] suffering
[2:26:02] for both he does sanctify
[2:26:04] and they who are sanctified
[2:26:06] are all water
[2:26:07] [Music]
[2:26:10] anybody here
[2:26:12] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[2:26:15] call them water
[2:26:18] so we are brother to the high priest
[2:26:21] [Applause]
[2:26:23] we are now the brother of the high
[2:26:24] priest
