[5:09] song as we get ready for the special.
[5:11] Jill, if you'd come. Therefore, the
[5:13] redeemed of the Lord shall return
[5:17] and come with singing
[5:20] and to Zion
[5:22] and everlasting joy shall be upon their
[5:27] head.

[6:18] head.
[6:21] Amen. An everlasting joy will be on
[6:23] their head. You can be seated tonight.
[6:25] This wasn't really a special. I'll
[6:27] confess I kind of drug everybody into
[6:29] this, but brother Sam said he was going
[6:31] to sing with me. So, I figured if if
[6:33] Brother Sam would sing with me, we'd
[6:35] just try this. And uh this this song
[6:37] kind of expresses the the joy in my
[6:40] heart that um kind of set me ringing
[6:43] today and thinking about the city of
[6:45] Zion. I'm just going to stand back here
[6:47] so I feel like I'm singing a special,
[6:48] but it's a special, but some of y'all
[6:49] probably know it. So, we're just going
[6:51] to ask you to sing it when I reach that
[6:53] city. If you'd pull that up on the
[6:54] projectors, number 222. And uh so
[6:57] thankful that the word has drawn us to
[6:59] that place and have have really having a
[7:01] place in that city. And that's really as
[7:03] I was thinking about that, I thought I'm
[7:04] so thankful that this city of Mount Zion
[7:07] that we that many talk about that many
[7:09] think about, it's a place they're going
[7:11] to, but I'm thankful that it's a place
[7:13] that I'm already possessing and
[7:14] beginning to dwell in and learning how
[7:16] to possess it and walk with our king.
[7:18] So, let's just if you know this song,
[7:20] you can sing this with us as we sing it.
[7:22] [Music]
[7:24] On top of Mount Zion is a city
[7:29] [Music]
[7:30] and the earth with its glory is the
[7:34] field.
[7:36] I shall look on its beauty in the
[7:39] morning
[7:41] when I reach that city on a hill.
[7:47] Oh that city
[7:50] on Mount Zion.
[7:53] Oh, a pilgrim, yet I love thee still.
[7:59] I'll not leave thee
[8:02] through the ages.
[8:05] When I reach that city on a hill,
[8:11] I'm invited to come home to that city.
[8:16] For the word says, whosoever will.
[8:22] And I'll come find mession for me
[8:26] waiting

[8:34] Oh, that city
[8:37] on Mount Zion.
[8:40] No, a pilgrim yet I love thee.
[8:45] I'll not leave thee
[8:48] through the ages.
[8:51] When I reach that city on a hill,
[8:57] death will never molest me in that city.
[9:02] Never leave me lying cold in jail.
[9:08] And I'll enter to live up there forever.
[9:14] When I reach that city on a hill,
[9:19] oh that city
[9:22] on Mount Zion,
[9:25] go a pilgrim, yet I love thee city.
[9:31] I'll not leave thee
[9:33] through the ages
[9:36] when I reach that city on a hill.
[9:42] So I'll stay here until my Savior calls
[9:47] me, trying daily to perform his will.
[9:53] Then he'll say unto me, well done up
[9:57] yonder.
[9:59] When I reach that city on a hill, oh

[18:19] whole.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's
[18:25] bow our heads together.
[18:28] Oh, heavenly father, we thank you, Lord
[18:30] Jesus, for the privilege of gathering
[18:33] once again. And God, as we're here,
[18:36] we've sung, Lord, our hearts have opened
[18:38] and sung to you praises, Lord, for you
[18:41] are worthy of all praise. And God, we
[18:44] come to the part of the service, Lord,
[18:46] where we're going to look into your
[18:48] word. And we ask God that you would give
[18:50] us the spirit of revelation Lord. That
[18:53] you would open our understanding, open
[18:54] our eyes, Lord, and that you would help
[18:56] us open our hearts to receive your word.
[18:58] And may it come into us, Lord, and may
[19:01] it abide in us. And may it take root and
[19:03] grow and produce fruit unto yourself,
[19:05] Lord. For God, we want to be the vessels
[19:07] that you can pour yourself into and use
[19:09] in this hour. We ask that you would,
[19:12] Lord, take this vessel of mine under
[19:13] your control. Lord, that you would speak
[19:16] your words of eternal life and that you
[19:17] would bring changes in our life. That
[19:19] you'd bring greater understanding,
[19:21] greater revelation, Lord, and that we
[19:22] would have greater strength by your word
[19:24] to do what you've called us to do in
[19:26] this hour. For God, we're surrendered to
[19:28] you in a greater way. And we ask for
[19:30] your help in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[19:35] Man, God bless you all. It's so good to
[19:37] be here together. Amen. While you're
[19:39] standing, we're going to ask you to take
[19:40] your Bibles. And I I just want to let
[19:43] you know we've got a special service.
[19:44] They're all special, but this is a
[19:46] exciting service for uh for brother
[19:49] Peter and sister Sharon Art. They're
[19:51] visiting with us again, and they desire
[19:53] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[19:54] Jesus Christ at the end of the service.
[19:57] So, God bless you all. We're so excited
[19:58] for them. Amen. God is taking them on a
[20:01] journey and bringing them into more and
[20:02] more light. And as they see the truth
[20:04] revelation of baptism in Jesus' name,
[20:06] they surrender to it and desire desired
[20:09] to identify with him in his name. And so
[20:12] we're very very excited for them. And so
[20:15] we'll do that at the end of the service.
[20:16] Also, they've bought a place here so
[20:18] they can stay here and fellowship with
[20:20] us for weeks at a time. So we appreciate
[20:22] that because we enjoy their fellowship
[20:24] very much. So may God bless them in that
[20:26] whole process.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, I'd like to welcome Mr. and
[20:32] Mrs. Is Wesley Godfrey into the service?
[20:34] God bless you. It's good to have you
[20:35] guys here.
[20:37] Amen.
[20:40] I looked over when I came out and Wesley
[20:42] was by himself and I wondered what
[20:43] happened already.
[20:45] Not that fast, but Amen. We're happy to
[20:48] have him here. God bless you. And
[20:49] they've got a a reception here uh
[20:52] Saturday. So, everybody's welcome to
[20:54] that. The information is on the bulletin
[20:56] board. So, we're looking forward to
[20:57] spending that time together with them
[21:00] this Saturday. Amen. Also wanted to
[21:03] remind you that there'll be no service
[21:05] next Wednesday. A week from today, we'll
[21:07] be preparing for the retreat and we'll
[21:09] be meeting together Thursday over at the
[21:10] retreat. So, no service next Wednesday.
[21:14] Also, I was notified we had some
[21:15] visitors from Edmonton, Brother Kenny
[21:18] and Sister Peggy Schlay from Brother
[21:20] Eugene Bronze Church, and they're
[21:22] passing through on their winter home to
[21:23] Virginia. Is that you back there? God
[21:25] bless you. It's good to see you. You're
[21:27] very welcome here, and we're glad to
[21:29] have you with us. Amen.
[21:31] God is good. You never know who's going
[21:33] to pass through. Amen. We enjoy it. We
[21:35] love the fellowship and we love when
[21:37] people drop in to see us. I love living
[21:39] at the intersection of 80, 90, and 70
[21:42] and 30 because we get a lot of people
[21:44] passing through. So, it's quite a
[21:46] blessing. Amen. If you would turn with
[21:49] me to First John chapter 3.
[21:53] 1 John chapter 3.
[21:58] I say I appreciated the impromptu
[22:00] special. It was wonderful. God bless
[22:02] you, brother John, brother Sam.
[22:05] Amen.
[22:07] First John chapter 3 verse one. Behold
[22:10] what manner of love the father bestowed
[22:13] upon us that we should be called the
[22:15] sons of God.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; That is love, friends.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; What manner of love the father has
[22:22] bestowed upon us that we should be
[22:24] called the sons of God. We read it, but
[22:27] it's actually surreal.
[22:29] It It's I mean, when you just think in
[22:32] human terms, it's beyond the human mind.
[22:34] It's It's I I really wish that the full
[22:38] impact of that could hit me in the
[22:39] reality that it is in. Behold, what
[22:42] manner of love the father bestowed upon
[22:44] us that we should be called the sons of
[22:46] God. Therefore, the world knoweth us
[22:49] not, because it knew him not. Beloved,
[22:52] now are we the sons of God.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. not will be.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Now are we the sons of God. And it does
[23:00] not yet appear what we shall be. But we
[23:02] know that when we shall when when he
[23:04] shall appear, we shall be like him, for
[23:06] we shall see him as he is.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you take your
[23:10] seats. And may God bless his word unto
[23:13] us. Amen.
[23:15] God is so good.
[23:17] Amen. And I'm going to um if we could
[23:20] pull up the slides, Brother Franco,
[23:24] I
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The Super Race.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm still reading out of my little
[23:32] booklet. So, if you have if you have
[23:34] your booklet, uh I can't get away from
[23:36] this little booklet. It's been in my
[23:38] Bible for a couple months now, but uh
[23:40] I've got it on the overhead if you don't
[23:42] have your booklet with you. But if you
[23:43] do have the booklet, we're going to read
[23:46] uh from the first page, paragraph 171-1.
[23:50] And uh I'm going to pull it up on the
[23:52] overhead,
[23:54] but it says, "Here is what I'm trying to
[23:57] say to you. The law of reproduction is
[24:00] that each species brings forth after its
[24:02] own kind, even according to Genesis
[24:05] 1:11. And God said, "Let the earth bring
[24:07] forth grass and the herb yielding seed,
[24:09] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[24:11] his kind. whose seed is in itself upon
[24:14] the earth and it was so. Whatever life
[24:16] was in the seed came forth into a plant
[24:18] and then into the fruit. The very same
[24:21] law applies to the church today.
[24:23] Whatever seed started the church will
[24:25] come forth and be like the original seed
[24:27] because it is the same seed. In these
[24:30] last days, the true bride church,
[24:32] Christ's seed. So the true bride
[24:34] churches of what seed? Christ seed,
[24:36] &gt;&gt; which is the royal seed, seed of
[24:38] Abraham. And that's what she's part of.
[24:40] That's her lineage. the the true bride
[24:43] church, Christ seed, will come to the
[24:44] headstone and she will be the super
[24:47] church.
[24:49] She will be a super race
[24:51] &gt;&gt; as she nears him. Amen. That's what we
[24:54] want to talk about this morning. The
[24:56] quote goes on. It says, "They in the
[24:57] bride will be so much like him. They
[24:59] will even be in his very image. That is
[25:02] in order to be united with him. They
[25:04] will be one. They will be the very
[25:08] manifestation of the word of the living
[25:10] God. Denominations cannot produce this
[25:14] wrong seed. They will produce their
[25:16] creeds and their dogmas mixed with the
[25:18] word. This mongerizing brings forth a
[25:20] hybrid product. Amen. So we got to find
[25:24] we find out that the original seed
[25:26] brings forth the original life. Amen.
[25:29] And brings back the original life. Amen.
[25:31] That was in that bride tree in tree in
[25:33] the beginning. And that's what God's
[25:34] done is brought us back to the original
[25:36] seed, to the original word, to produce
[25:39] the original life in the tree once
[25:41] again. And that's what we're here to do.
[25:43] But I I love this when he said, "She
[25:46] will be the super church." I'm going to
[25:48] highlight that, too, cuz that just
[25:49] sounds good.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; She will be the super church. A super
[25:54] race. And I want to talk about that
[25:57] super race because it it sometimes when
[25:59] we hear terms like this, it it it it
[26:02] it's I mean it's fantastic. These are
[26:04] fantastic things and they're
[26:05] overwhelming to say, but I really want
[26:07] to think about it. I want to absorb it.
[26:09] I want to understand what does it mean
[26:11] to be a super church? What does it mean
[26:13] to be a super race? Amen. Because it's
[26:16] got to be in order to be a super race,
[26:19] it's got to be the God race. It's got to
[26:21] be God's children manifest upon the
[26:23] earth. Amen. and what manner of love
[26:26] that is bestowed upon us the father that
[26:28] he should that we should be called the
[26:29] sons of God.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:32] So they will be the very manifestation
[26:35] of the word of the living God. Amen.
[26:38] This is what produces a super race is
[26:41] the fact that the word amen the word
[26:45] finds a recipient in this age. the true
[26:48] word, the original word, the full word,
[26:50] the whole word, with the whole thought
[26:52] and mind of God with his purpose and
[26:54] intention for a church to have a bride.
[26:56] Amen. A a a bride that's come out of him
[27:00] that's going to be united with him.
[27:02] Amen. That original word for a church.
[27:05] Amen. Has to find a resting place. It's
[27:07] got to find a recipient in this time.
[27:09] And so when the original seed has come
[27:11] back, there's got to be good ground
[27:13] prepared, a predestinated ground to
[27:15] receive that seed. And when she receives
[27:17] that seed, she will be the very
[27:19] manifestation of the word of the living
[27:21] God. Not because she's super duper in
[27:24] herself, but she's received the original
[27:27] word. And the original word has the
[27:29] original life. And the original life
[27:31] will produce its own life.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we talk about a super
[27:37] church, a super race, uh the very
[27:39] manifestation of the word of God, this
[27:41] is not we're not talking about our flesh
[27:44] bodies. We're not talking about
[27:45] ourselves as in this hybrid creature
[27:48] that we are. We're talking about a place
[27:50] for that word to connect to because the
[27:52] word has to come to the word. The word
[27:54] predestinated with the word before the
[27:56] foundation or the word for the age with
[27:58] the word predestinated. And when those
[28:00] two come together, it springs to life.
[28:02] And then that word begins to reproduce
[28:04] itself.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; And a people.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; That's why they'll be the very
[28:10] manifestation of the word of the living
[28:11] God. That's why denominations can't
[28:14] produce this. It's not because they're
[28:16] inferior people.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; We we don't we don't look at those who
[28:21] go to other churches and with sincerity
[28:23] and desire to serve God and they we can
[28:26] say they can never produce this. Why can
[28:29] they never produce this? It's not
[28:30] because they're inferior as people. Some
[28:33] of them can. I mean, if we want to start
[28:35] measuring ourselves up on a human level,
[28:37] we would be inferior. many of us in many
[28:40] ways and probably inferior in
[28:42] dedication, inferior, amen, in personal
[28:44] sacrifice. Inferior in many ways, but
[28:47] there's one thing we're not inferior to
[28:49] because we've been given the original
[28:51] word. And the original word is what's
[28:52] superior. That's what's super.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; So to be a super church, Amen. It takes
[29:00] a super word with a super spirit with a
[29:02] super life, the original life to produce
[29:05] a super church. It doesn't take a
[29:07] superhuman being. It takes a super word
[29:10] and a regular common everyday human
[29:12] being.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Denominations can't produce this not
[29:16] because they're inferior. They can't
[29:18] produce it because they don't have the
[29:19] word.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; It's that simple, friends. It's so
[29:24] simple. Amen. That's why there's no
[29:26] looking down. There's no belittling.
[29:28] There's no begrudging. There's no
[29:30] there's no pride. There's no animosity.
[29:32] Amen. what what manner of love the
[29:34] father's bestowed upon us that we should
[29:36] be called the sons of god. It's beyond
[29:38] us. It's beyond our thinking. It's
[29:40] beyond anything about us. It's something
[29:43] he predetermined before the foundation.
[29:45] It's something that abides in us. Amen.
[29:48] In our soul, amen. That he placed there
[29:50] a portion of himself to connect with the
[29:53] word for this age to bring forth a super
[29:55] church, a super race, the very
[29:57] manifestation of the word of the living
[29:59] God.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad to be a super church
[30:03] that I don't have to be a super person.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad to be a super race. I
[30:09] don't have to become a super person
[30:11] because all that I all that I would do
[30:13] is try harder and fail bigger. Amen. But
[30:16] it's not about me. It's about that word
[30:19] finding a resting place. And the resting
[30:21] place is not because I got wiser and I
[30:23] got smarter and I decided to believe the
[30:25] truth. There's a resting place. Brother
[30:27] Bam said that seed Amen. He went through
[30:29] the parable of the seeds. The seed had
[30:31] to have good ground. He said
[30:33] predestinated ground. God had decided
[30:36] he's going to have a place for this
[30:38] original seed to fall in the last days.
[30:41] And he did it himself.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; So it's not what I've done. Amen. It's
[30:46] only what I believe. It's what he did.
[30:48] Oh, praise God.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; So when we say she'll be a super church,
[30:53] she'll be a super race. We can shout
[30:54] amen to the top of our voice and we can
[30:57] realize there's not a thing super about
[30:59] me. I'm I'm probably I you know
[31:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know where I would rank on the
[31:05] grand scale of things, but probably
[31:06] slightly below average, you know, if you
[31:08] took everything. I mean, I don't know. I
[31:10] I might be being generous to myself. I
[31:12] might be
[31:14] I heard one man say one time, he said,
[31:17] "I graduated in the top 10% of the lower
[31:20] half of my grade."
[31:25] So, there's always got to be some way to
[31:27] phrase it to make it sound nice. Amen.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Where we rank as human beings has
[31:32] nothing to do with it. We've got
[31:34] different abilities and different skills
[31:36] and different complex and different
[31:37] hang-ups, different genetic things and
[31:39] all kinds of stuff about us. Amen. But
[31:41] that's not what we're looking at. That's
[31:43] not the super church. The super church
[31:46] is the super word living in a people who
[31:49] have surrendered, who have given their
[31:51] lives to Christ. And Christ has come by
[31:52] the sanctifying power of the blood to
[31:55] wash them so that he can enter himself
[31:57] to make that word live.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That what will be the super
[32:03] church, the super race.
[32:06] Praise be to God. I want to look at the
[32:08] church age book here. An excerpt from
[32:10] that in the Leosian church age. He says,
[32:13] "But now he is standing in the midst of
[32:16] the church. As he stands there revealing
[32:18] who he is in the last age, he calls
[32:20] himself the author of the creation of
[32:23] God. If you look at Revelation chapter
[32:25] 3, he says the beginning of the creation
[32:27] of God. And brother Ram tells us that's
[32:29] the author. He's the beginning and the
[32:31] beginner
[32:33] &gt;&gt; of the creation of God.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; This is another creation. This has to do
[32:38] with the church. This is a special
[32:41] designation of himself. He is the
[32:43] creator of that church. The heavenly
[32:45] bridegroom created his own bride. As the
[32:48] spirit of God, he came down and created
[32:49] in the Virgin Mary the cells from which
[32:51] his body was born.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; I want to repeat that. He created the
[32:55] very cells in the womb of Mary for that
[32:57] body. It was not enough for the Holy
[32:59] Spirit to simply give life to a human om
[33:02] supplied by Mary. That would have been
[33:05] sinful mankind reproducing a body. That
[33:08] would not have produced the last Adam.
[33:10] of him it was said, "Lo, a body hast
[33:12] thou father prepared for me." God, not
[33:15] Mary, provided that body. Mary was the
[33:18] human incubator, and she carried that
[33:20] holy child and brought him to birth. It
[33:22] was a God man. He was the son of God. He
[33:25] was of the new creation. Man and God met
[33:29] and joined. He was the first of this new
[33:32] race. He is the head of this new race.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; What kind of race do you think this is?
[33:38] &gt;&gt; This new race. Could that be a super
[33:40] race?
[33:42] &gt;&gt; If he's the head of that race, I say it
[33:44] is a super race
[33:46] &gt;&gt; because he's the super one. Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Bam's going to go into
[33:52] a series of scriptures here. So, we
[33:54] pulled these up. And he is the head of
[33:56] the body, the church, who is the
[33:58] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[34:00] that in all things he might have the
[34:02] preeminence.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Then he goes to 2 Corinthians 5.
[34:05] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[34:07] is a new creation. Old things have
[34:09] passed away. Behold, all things are
[34:12] become new.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; That's why this doesn't have anything to
[34:16] do with your flesh. This has to do with
[34:18] something deeper than that.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; I don't say it has nothing to do with
[34:22] your flesh because it's manifest through
[34:23] your flesh. Your flesh is part of it.
[34:25] Amen. But this this resides deeper than
[34:27] that. Amen. The new birth is deeper than
[34:29] that. Then he goes then he says there
[34:32] you can see that through though man was
[34:34] of the old order or creation now in
[34:37] union with Christ he has become the new
[34:40] creation of God.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10 for we are his
[34:45] workmanship created in union with Christ
[34:48] Jesus unto good works.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then Ephesians 4:24, "And that
[34:55] ye put on the new man, which after God
[34:57] is created in righteousness and true
[34:59] holiness."
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; So now he's talking about the new birth,
[35:02] making us a new creature in Christ
[35:04] Jesus. The new man.
[35:07] Uh
[35:08] then he goes on to say this, this new
[35:10] creation is not the old creation made
[35:12] over or would not be called a new
[35:14] creation. This is exactly what it says.
[35:17] It is new creation. It is another
[35:20] creation distinct from the old one. No
[35:22] longer is he dealing by ways of the
[35:24] flesh. That was how he dealt with
[35:26] Israel. He chose Abraham and of
[35:28] Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac
[35:30] line. But now out of every kindred,
[35:32] tribe, nation, he has purposed a new
[35:34] creation. He is the first of that
[35:37] creation. He was God created in the form
[35:40] of man. Now by his spirit, he is
[35:42] creating many sons unto himself. God the
[35:46] creator creating himself a part of his
[35:48] creation.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Did we catch that? Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; How is God the creator creating himself
[35:56] a part of his creation?
[35:59] He's doing it by his spirit.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; He is creating many sons into himself.
[36:06] This is through new birth.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; God the creator creating himself a part
[36:10] of his creation.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. This is the true
[36:16] revelation of God.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the seventh seal? What is
[36:21] Revelation 10:7? The mystery of God been
[36:23] being finished. Amen. This is the true
[36:26] revelation of God. This was his purpose.
[36:29] Amen. And this purpose took form through
[36:32] election. That is why he could look
[36:34] right down to the last age when all
[36:36] would be over and see himself still in
[36:37] the midst of the church as the author of
[36:40] this new creation of God. His sovereign
[36:42] power brought it to pass. By his own
[36:44] decree, he elected the members of this
[36:46] new creation. He predestinated them to
[36:48] the adoption of children according to
[36:50] the good pleasure of his will. By his
[36:53] omniscience and omnipotence, he brought
[36:55] it to pass. That's why it'll be a super
[36:58] church. That's what'll be a super race
[37:00] because the super one determined it by
[37:04] &gt;&gt; by his superpower.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the true revelation of God
[37:12] in Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[37:14] says, "Now he sanctified with his spirit
[37:17] and blood a church that he might make
[37:19] every promise in this last day be
[37:21] revealed." Now, see, he could go back
[37:23] and pick up what these other fellows has
[37:25] left off here and in the last days and
[37:27] by his holy spirit reveal all the
[37:29] mystery of the seven seals. See, he is
[37:31] expressing himself. That's his purpose.
[37:34] That's why he died. That's the second
[37:36] fold of the three-fold manifestation.
[37:38] First, to express himself in Christ,
[37:41] then express himself through the church.
[37:43] And that same thing, Christ was the
[37:45] word. And the church becomes the word
[37:48] when it lets the word go through them.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; This is this is what it's all about,
[37:54] friends. It's not I mean, this is not
[37:56] about Amen. God God coming down and
[37:59] finding super duper people. And he's
[38:01] making a super race out of super duper
[38:03] people. Amen. What God's coming down is
[38:05] he's finding his good ground. He's
[38:06] finding his predestinated people, the
[38:08] people who can receive the word. And he
[38:10] brings the light of the age and connects
[38:12] with that word and brings that light to
[38:14] life. Amen. And now, amen. That word for
[38:17] this age when it comes to life, it has
[38:19] to have a vessel to work through. When
[38:21] it finds the vessel that will surrender
[38:23] to the word and lay down their life and
[38:26] say, I believe that be it unto me
[38:28] according to your word. Now, the life of
[38:30] the word will come in and manifest that
[38:32] life. And now that Christ was the word
[38:34] and the church becomes the word when it
[38:37] lets the word go through them. Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; We literally become the word. Why?
[38:42] Because the word when the word says,
[38:44] amen, that the bride will be such and
[38:46] such. And when we receive the word and
[38:48] now the life of that word manifest
[38:50] itself in us, we've become that word.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the word is living in our day.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[39:03] Paul says in Galatians 4:19, "My little
[39:06] children of whom I travail in birth
[39:08] again until Christ be formed in you."
[39:13] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was trying to bring the
[39:16] church to to where Christ is going to be
[39:18] formed in you. That's what all his
[39:20] preaching and teaching was all about.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we're manifesting in this
[39:25] day. the invisible union.
[39:29] He says the that oh that spiritual union
[39:32] of Christ in his church. Now when the
[39:34] flesh is becoming word
[39:37] and the word is becoming flesh
[39:40] &gt;&gt; manifested, vindicated. How? By simply
[39:44] letting the word flow through.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; By just simply yielding to it, obeying
[39:49] it,
[39:50] &gt;&gt; surrendering to it, opening our heart to
[39:52] it.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It it's it's more simple
[39:55] than what we think because it's it's not
[39:57] what we produce because we don't have
[39:59] the power to produce anything. But it's
[40:01] what we surrender to that he comes and
[40:04] produces himself.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; And that's why he's restored the word in
[40:07] our day so that that the true word with
[40:10] the true power of the full word can
[40:12] manifest itself. But it's got to
[40:14] manifest through a people.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; And I want to be one of those people.
[40:20] First John, I'm going to read 1 John
[40:22] chapter 4 says, "Hereby know ye the
[40:26] spirit of God.
[40:29] Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
[40:31] Christ has come in the flesh is of God."
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jesus Christ I I just want to
[40:39] ask is Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[40:42] or has come in the flesh?
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Present tense. Every spirit that confess
[40:47] that uh I'm sorry. Every spirit that
[40:50] confesses that Jesus Christ is come in
[40:52] the flesh is of God. And every spirit
[40:54] that confesses not that Jesus Christ is
[40:56] come in the flesh is not of God. And
[40:58] this is that spirit of Antichrist
[41:00] whereof you have heard that it should
[41:02] come. And even now already is it in the
[41:04] world. Ye are of God, little children,
[41:07] and have overcome them. Because greater
[41:10] is he that is in you than he that is in
[41:12] the world. How is it that we've
[41:14] overcome? Because greater is he that is
[41:17] in me.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; It didn't say because greater is me.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; But greater is he that is in me than he
[41:24] that's in the world.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not me that's overcoming
[41:28] the world, but it's greater that he
[41:30] that's in me that's overcoming the world
[41:33] and overcoming the Antichrist spirit
[41:34] that's taking over the world and
[41:35] overcoming everything. It's overcoming
[41:37] by what? Greater is he that is in me
[41:42] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message, he that is in you,
[41:48] the prophet says, if we if we only could
[41:52] receive this truth, now just a moment.
[41:54] If we only could realize what this
[41:56] scripture mean, he that is in you is
[41:59] greater than he that's in the world. We
[42:01] can't understand that. Yet we say we
[42:03] believe it and we know it's true, but we
[42:06] really don't understand it. Greater is
[42:09] he that is in you than he that's in the
[42:10] world. What is in you that's greater?
[42:13] It's Christ the anointed.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; God that was in Christ is in you.
[42:18] Greater is he that is in you than he
[42:20] that's in the world. Then if he is in
[42:22] you, it's not you anymore living. It's
[42:25] him living in you. See, it's not your
[42:28] thinking what you would think about
[42:29] this. It's what he said about this. See?
[42:32] Amen.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Then if he's in you, he absolutely would
[42:36] not deny what he said. He couldn't do
[42:38] it. But he would keep what he has said
[42:40] and he is trying to find that person
[42:43] that he can vindicate himself through.
[42:45] And now that doesn't mean he has to do
[42:47] it to everybody.
[42:50] In the time that Moses led the children
[42:52] of Israel, there was one that was Moses.
[42:53] The rest of them just followed the
[42:55] message. See, some of them tried to
[42:57] raise up to impersonate it and God said,
[42:59] "Separate yourself." And just swallowed
[43:01] them up.
[43:02] But he that's in you is greater than he
[43:04] that's in the world. God in you like he
[43:07] was in Jesus Christ because that's all
[43:09] God was. He poured into Christ and all
[43:11] Christ was he poured into the church.
[43:13] See that's God in you. He that's in you.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to look at this this
[43:19] statement brother Brandham made. Amen.
[43:21] He starts talking about uh greater is he
[43:23] that's in you than he that's in the
[43:24] world. Then he comes and make this
[43:26] statement. He says that doesn't mean he
[43:28] has to do it to everybody. Yes, that's
[43:31] right.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Strange, but I I I want to talk about
[43:34] it. Amen. Can we just talk about it?
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; In the time that Moses led the children
[43:38] of Israel, there was one that was Moses.
[43:40] The rest of them just followed the
[43:41] message.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; And I This is just This is just your
[43:44] brother Chad. I'm just sharing with you
[43:46] what I see when I read this. The
[43:48] revelation that strikes me is brother
[43:50] Ben Brandham is not saying that the
[43:51] supernatural won't work in your life.
[43:53] That's not what he's saying. That it's
[43:54] not for you. It's only for one. But what
[43:56] he's saying is we don't have to become
[43:58] Malachi 4. We don't have to become Amen.
[44:02] We don't have to replicate Brother
[44:03] Benham's ministry. Amen. There was one
[44:05] that God raised up to fulfill Malachi 4.
[44:08] Amen. But Malachi 4 came to bring us to
[44:11] a place. Amen. And the rest of us are
[44:13] going to fill that place. Amen. So we
[44:15] don't have to go back and try to
[44:16] replicate Brother Ben. We don't need to
[44:18] get a tent and go touring around. Amen.
[44:20] And do healing lines, friends. God
[44:22] raised up one to vindicate the word for
[44:24] his day to draw the attention to the
[44:26] word to be Malachi 4. Amen. To be to be
[44:28] for the fulfillment of Revelation 10:1-7
[44:31] to fulfill the seventh angel ministry.
[44:33] Amen. To do all of the things to forrun
[44:35] the second coming. He already came and
[44:37] did that. We don't need to go back and
[44:39] do that. But we need to believe that
[44:41] message. Amen.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; And we need to follow after that
[44:44] message. The rest of them just followed
[44:46] the message. And so, uh, so many times,
[44:49] you know, we look at Brother Benham's
[44:51] life and it's so supernatural and then
[44:52] we look at ourselves.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Has anybody done that?
[44:57] &gt;&gt; You read the supernatural book and it's
[44:59] like, my goodness. And then you look at
[45:01] yourself. Hey, listen. But but but hey,
[45:04] I've talked to many of you. I've got my
[45:05] own testimony. You have your own
[45:06] testimony. It's not that the
[45:08] supernatural God doesn't work in
[45:09] supernatural ways in your life. Amen.
[45:11] But God does not want us to go try to
[45:14] replicate what we've seen. He did that.
[45:16] He had one in this generation and he
[45:18] already came and he already did what he
[45:19] was supposed to do. But what does that
[45:21] mean for you and I? Amen. That was the
[45:24] sign that actually brother Brandham said
[45:26] the prophet becomes the chief sign of
[45:28] the age. His life becomes the word. He
[45:31] said Jesus Christ was the chief sign. He
[45:33] was the super sign. And that super sign
[45:35] was manifest again in brother Brandham
[45:37] because it wasn't the man discerning the
[45:39] hearts of the people. Amen. Out in the
[45:41] congregation. That was Jesus Christ the
[45:44] super sign. And we received in this age
[45:46] a super sign.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; We had a super sign from a super God,
[45:51] from a super Jesus Christ. Amen. What
[45:53] was he doing? He was trying to call to a
[45:55] super church, to a super race. Amen.
[45:57] Come unto me. Come unto this message.
[46:00] I'm here to deliver something to you.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; So we all don't have to go back and be
[46:05] that. Amen. But that was to get our
[46:08] attention to bring us to where we're
[46:09] supposed to be. Moses came to be the
[46:12] deliverer because there was a prophecy
[46:13] that God told uh Abraham that thy
[46:16] children say so Jordan in a strange land
[46:18] for 400 years but I will bring them out
[46:21] with a mighty hand. Who is the eye? The
[46:23] eye is the superpower. The eye is the
[46:25] super one. The eye has the super sign.
[46:28] But how did the super one come? He came
[46:30] through Moses.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; He told Moses, Moses, hey, I've heard
[46:35] the cry of my people. I've come down to
[46:37] deliver them. Now come. I'm sending you.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; And Moses became the super sign to that
[46:44] age.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Super sign of what? Super sign of the
[46:48] promised word. Now it's time for
[46:51] deliverance.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; But
[46:56] what did that super sign do? What was
[47:00] the purpose of the super sign? What was
[47:03] the purpose of the supernatural
[47:04] ministry? What was the purpose of the
[47:06] signs that were given to him as
[47:07] vindication? What was the purpose of all
[47:10] of that? The purpose of all that was to
[47:12] fulfill the promise that I will give you
[47:14] this land.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; That I will bring Amen. your seed into
[47:19] this land and divide the inheritance
[47:21] into the seed of Abraham. That was the
[47:24] time. It was the time for that promise
[47:26] to be fulfilled.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; So Moses goes and he he does the
[47:33] supernatural. He does the miraculous. He
[47:35] does what?
[47:37] I mean, can you imagine standing there
[47:39] and watching it, friends?
[47:43] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine what it was like to
[47:46] stand by the Red Sea
[47:49] &gt;&gt; and hear the blast of wind and feel it
[47:51] and see the water roll up like a wall.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Can't imagine what that was like.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine all the other signs and
[48:00] all the other uh uh uh miracles and even
[48:02] the plagues. I can't imagine what that
[48:04] was like.
[48:06] But none of that was for the children of
[48:09] Israel to replicate.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; There was one Moses.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; The rest of them just followed the
[48:17] message.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; What was the message? You're leaving
[48:20] this bondage and you're going back to
[48:22] your inheritance.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; To possess it, to live in it.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; God speaks through Moses in the Exodus.
[48:30] He said, "And Moses went up unto God,
[48:33] and the Lord God called unto him out of
[48:35] the mountain, saying, "This shalt thou
[48:36] say to the house of Jacob, and tell the
[48:38] children of Israel." Now, this he's
[48:41] saying this is before the law comes, he
[48:45] brings them out of Egypt and they come
[48:46] to Mount Si and and when he brings them
[48:48] to Mount Si, because that's the
[48:50] commandment. You go get them and bring
[48:51] them back to this mountain to worship.
[48:53] And Moses does. And when he comes back,
[48:55] he he goes up to the mountain to talk to
[48:56] God. And God says, "Now I want you to
[48:59] now that you've brought my people to me
[49:01] on this mountain. I've got a message
[49:02] that I want you to give them." And he
[49:05] says, "Ye have seen what I did unto the
[49:08] Egyptians, and how I bear you on eagle's
[49:10] wings, and brought you unto myself. Now
[49:13] therefore, if you will obey my voice
[49:15] indeed, and keep my covenant, then you
[49:17] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[49:19] above all people. For all the earth is
[49:22] mine, and you shall be unto me a kingdom
[49:24] of priests, and a holy nation." These
[49:26] are the words which thou shalt speak
[49:28] unto the children of Israel.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; I love this because what he tells them
[49:33] is he said, "Go tell them that you're
[49:36] going to be a peculiar treasure unto me
[49:37] above all people.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a kingdom of priest
[49:41] and a holy nation." He said, "I've
[49:44] called you for a purpose and I've called
[49:46] you to be something and I've called you
[49:47] for a position and I've called you to
[49:49] fulfill my word in you." and and he and
[49:53] this is what this is what his commission
[49:55] is for them. This is what he brought the
[49:57] people to himself to be. I want you to
[49:59] be uh if I could say it this way, I want
[50:03] you to be a super nation.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; I've brought you to be the super nation
[50:09] above all nations. A holy nation. A
[50:11] peculiar people assigned to the whole
[50:13] world. My people on display in my land.
[50:16] I want you to be a super nation. A holy
[50:19] nation. A peculiar people. a kingdom of
[50:21] priests. All of you
[50:24] &gt;&gt; listen, they had a position. They didn't
[50:26] need to go back and replicate Moses'
[50:28] position. They had a position. They were
[50:29] to be a kingdom of priests and a holy
[50:31] nation and a light on a hill. And they
[50:34] were to move into the promised land and
[50:36] take each one their position. Not to go
[50:38] back and take Moses position, but each
[50:40] one take their position. Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of Moses's ministry
[50:45] was to bring them out so God could
[50:47] identify who they are and God could tell
[50:49] them what he wants to do with them and
[50:50] make them a a a a super nation, a super
[50:53] people and bring them into their land to
[50:55] set up a super kingdom, a super nation.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; For God.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; But when God went to do this, he gave
[51:03] them instructions and he be going to
[51:04] speak to them himself and they could not
[51:06] endure his voice. And and that's when
[51:08] they asked for the law. Brother Rem told
[51:10] us. And they began to fall. Amen. From
[51:12] that great position.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; But uh
[51:17] oh my goodness.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; So Moses
[51:24] Moses was the mighty man of the hour.
[51:27] He had all the gifts and and God had
[51:30] used him
[51:31] &gt;&gt; to go and get his people.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; And bring his people into the word.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:39] And they were going to be the word made
[51:42] flesh.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; As they step into the promise and take
[51:46] the promised land.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that was the word. I shall
[51:51] bring your people and they shall possess
[51:53] the land.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; I will divide unto them an inheritance.
[51:56] Amen. To the seed of Abraham. That was
[51:58] the word. And when those people when
[52:01] they let the word flow through them,
[52:02] when they moved into the promised land
[52:05] and and and and listen, God says, "I'll
[52:07] drive out the inhabitants. I'll give you
[52:09] the land. I'll do they weren't supposed
[52:11] to do it of their own power." But then
[52:12] he says, "Now you go possess the land."
[52:14] Amen. And they were to go up and take
[52:16] their position in the promise. And as
[52:18] they took their position and they
[52:19] inhabited the land and they planted
[52:21] vineyards and they ate the corner of the
[52:23] land and they they were established in
[52:25] the place that God had promised Abraham,
[52:27] they were becoming the word made flesh.
[52:29] This was God's word fleshed out.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; But we know that they failed because
[52:35] they failed to keep all of the word.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and uh they they came they
[52:43] came to Kadesh Barnea. They come through
[52:45] the journey and we won't go through all
[52:46] of that, but they come to Kish Barnea
[52:48] and in Kadesh Barnea they send out the
[52:49] spies. The spies go spy out the land and
[52:52] they come back and they say, "Surely
[52:55] it's a good land."
[52:57] &gt;&gt; I mean, what the word says about it is
[52:59] true. Amen. What God said, what Moses
[53:02] told us is true. Amen. But but listen,
[53:05] there's something else that wasn't told
[53:06] us. There's giants in the land and
[53:08] there's walled cities and it's a land
[53:10] that eats up the inhabitants of the
[53:11] people and all these other things. And
[53:13] the people be they begin to rebel
[53:16] against God. They begin to murmur
[53:17] against God and gets Moses and gets
[53:19] Aaron. And they begin to cry out and
[53:21] they they say, "Now Moses, you've
[53:23] brought us here to kill us and let's
[53:25] make a captain and let's go back and
[53:27] what what's going on? What's happening
[53:28] in this scene?" Amen. These people,
[53:31] Amen, they believed Moses. They believed
[53:33] Moses' ministry. They believed the
[53:35] supernatural. They believed all Hey,
[53:37] listen. Every one of these people that
[53:40] are here in Kades Barnea, they believed
[53:42] that when Moses lifted up the rod and
[53:44] spoke, the waters parted.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; They believed Moses was a prophet of
[53:48] God. They believed that Moses, Amen,
[53:51] brought the plagues. They believed that
[53:52] through the voice of Moses, God
[53:53] delivered. They believed all of that.
[53:55] But the problem is they did not believe
[53:58] Moses's message. Because Moses' message
[54:00] was not, "I'm parting the Red Sea." His
[54:03] message was not, "I'm bringing plagues."
[54:05] His message was, "I'm bringing you into
[54:07] the word. I'm bringing you into your
[54:09] heritage. I'm bringing you into your
[54:11] land." Amen. And now when they go to the
[54:13] land and it looks too hard and looks too
[54:15] difficult and they can't do it. Amen.
[54:17] They're looking at themselves. The
[54:18] unbelief that is in their heart starts
[54:20] to creep up. Amen. And it's not that
[54:22] they disbelieve who Moses is and they
[54:24] disbelieve the miracles of Moses and
[54:26] they disbelieve the supernatural. They
[54:28] disbelieve the message.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] But there was two who believed the
[54:36] message. Amen. They believed that what
[54:39] Moses had said about the word was true.
[54:41] That when Moses said, "God, come and
[54:43] told me, now is the time for
[54:45] deliverance. Now is the time to take
[54:47] your inheritance." That God had told our
[54:50] father Abraham, "I will bring your
[54:52] children back into this land." That time
[54:54] is now for the word. And there was only
[54:57] two people in all that camp that
[54:59] actually believed the message
[55:03] &gt;&gt; because the message wasn't go do signs
[55:06] in Egypt. That's not the message. The
[55:08] message wasn't part the Red Sea. That's
[55:10] not the message. The message is you're
[55:12] going back to your inheritance. You're
[55:14] coming back to be a holy nation. You're
[55:16] coming to be all that I already for
[55:18] ordained for you to be. That's the
[55:20] message. And in that message, they
[55:22] couldn't go backwards. And that message
[55:24] they had to go forwards into the land.
[55:26] And in order to fulfill the message and
[55:28] in order to be the word made flesh, they
[55:30] had to go to the portion that was
[55:32] portioned out to them. They had to go
[55:34] take it. They had to possess it. They
[55:36] had to plant. They had to grow. They had
[55:38] to fight out the Canaanites. And they
[55:40] had to be established in their land. And
[55:42] that was becoming the word made flesh.
[55:45] That's what made them message believers.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was only one Moses, but they
[55:53] had to believe the message. Well, what
[55:54] does it mean to believe the message? It
[55:56] means to move on into the word and
[55:58] become the word and manifest the word
[56:00] and let the word flow through you.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; To come back to being the church that
[56:05] she was at Pentecost, to be established
[56:07] upon the doctrines of the fathers, to
[56:09] come back to everything that Paul said,
[56:11] everything that Peter said, everything
[56:13] that we were taught to be as a church
[56:16] &gt;&gt; with the full life, full manifestation,
[56:19] full gifts, everything. Amen.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; But not back to a one-man ministry. Not
[56:23] back to everything being wrapped up in
[56:25] one man and that one man. No, that's not
[56:27] the message. The message is ye are the
[56:30] sons of God. Now you are the sons of God
[56:33] and he's brought you back to your
[56:34] inheritance, back to your promised land.
[56:37] Now possess your land. Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; When Joshua and Caleb,
[56:45] they saw all that Moses did.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; And how it must have stirred their
[56:50] hearts.
[56:52] This is the time. This is God.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Everybody else in the camp, they saw
[56:57] that Moses did. How must have stirred
[56:58] their hearts. Say, "This is God. This is
[57:00] the time."
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] I believe, listen, when Miam took up the
[57:08] tambourine and the and the daughters of
[57:10] Israel danced on the shore, Amen.
[57:12] because the horse and rider was thrown
[57:13] into the sea, they were all singing the
[57:16] same song and they were all excited
[57:17] about the same thing.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz they saw the miraculous and they
[57:21] believed the miraculous and they
[57:27] &gt;&gt; But you know what? God never asked any
[57:30] of them to go bring plagues in Egypt.
[57:35] What God asked them to do was move into
[57:37] the word.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; What made them a super nation was not to
[57:46] go back into Egypt and do what Moses
[57:47] did. What made them a super nation was
[57:48] to go forward into the message.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:54] when the 10 spies come back and the 12
[57:58] but the 10 with an evil report and they
[58:00] say we be not able.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; The land is great and but we be not able
[58:06] to take it. Listen, that was a direct
[58:09] contradiction to the message.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; They had saw the supernatural. They had
[58:17] saw they had saw the miracles. They had
[58:19] saw and they wouldn't deny. Listen
[58:21] friends, I think it's so important to
[58:23] realize not one of them would deny any
[58:25] miracle. They stood there and watched it
[58:27] happen with their own they
[58:30] &gt;&gt; weren't reading in a book,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; right,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; or a news article. They were there.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; But they did not believe in the
[58:41] supernatural ability of God to work
[58:43] through them.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. They believed in the
[58:47] supernatural ability of God to work
[58:48] through Moses,
[58:50] &gt;&gt; but not the supernatural ability of God
[58:52] to work through them to give them the
[58:55] power to manifest the word.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Which was what? Go take the land.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb,
[59:08] they saw the same miracles. They were
[59:09] stirred by the same thing. Only when
[59:12] they saw God part the Red Sea and they
[59:15] saw mana fall and they saw and they saw
[59:18] and they saw Amen. They saw
[59:22] they saw something more than what
[59:24] everybody else saw.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Everybody else saw miracles and
[59:27] witnessed miracles and testified
[59:29] miracles and they might have been on
[59:30] record as testifying. They might have
[59:32] wrote their own I was there this date
[59:34] and this is my eyewitness testimony and
[59:36] it might have went in the record with
[59:38] all the other records. Amen. But when
[59:40] they got to Kadesh Barnea, Amen. Their
[59:42] testimony failed. Their eyewitness
[59:44] account failed. It failed because of
[59:46] unbelief. But Joshua and Caleb, they
[59:49] steal the people. And they say, "Listen,
[59:51] have gone before us. We are more than
[59:53] able to take the land. We are more than
[59:56] able." He said, "These these enemies are
[59:59] but bread for us." Listen, what are they
[1:00:02] talking about? Walled cities, giants in
[1:00:04] the land. Brother Bam said, "Amen. a
[1:00:06] wall so thick they could run chariots
[1:00:08] around them. Amen. They saw all the
[1:00:10] fortifications and the armies and the
[1:00:12] armor and the helmet and the spears and
[1:00:14] ma everything everybody else saw and
[1:00:16] everybody else saw that and they saw
[1:00:18] themselves and they knew all that God
[1:00:20] had done and all that God had said. But
[1:00:22] when they saw all of that and they saw
[1:00:24] themselves, they say, "We be not able."
[1:00:26] But when Joshua and Caleb who were true
[1:00:28] believers of the message,
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. Not believers of
[1:00:33] a prophet, believers of the message
[1:00:36] because they believe the message. They
[1:00:38] say we are more than able to take it.
[1:00:41] And I want to tell you, I believe this
[1:00:42] message and we are more than able to
[1:00:44] live every word that's in this Bible.
[1:00:47] Amen. And every promise is ours. And I
[1:00:50] don't know how I'll do it. I don't know
[1:00:51] Joshua and Caleb, they didn't have a
[1:00:53] strategy for taking the land. They
[1:00:55] didn't have a tactic. They didn't have
[1:00:56] armorament. They didn't build extra big
[1:00:59] shields. And they they had no
[1:01:00] engineering. Amen. All they had was
[1:01:03] faith in the promise. If God could do
[1:01:05] that through Moses to bring me here,
[1:01:07] then God could work through me to take
[1:01:09] the land because God called me into my
[1:01:11] position. That's my land.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; That's why after 40 more years, 45 more
[1:01:17] years, Caleb would come to Joshua and
[1:01:19] say, "Give me my mountain. That's mine."
[1:01:22] And he goes, "I'm 85 years old
[1:01:26] and I'm just as strong at today as I was
[1:01:28] then for going out, for coming in. And
[1:01:31] I'll go. If God be with me, I'll take
[1:01:33] it." Why? He wasn't looking at the
[1:01:35] strength of his arms. He was looking at
[1:01:37] his faith in the message.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, we got a whole pile of people
[1:01:42] that believe in a prophet.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; But that prophet came to give us a
[1:01:47] message. And that message was, "You are
[1:01:49] the sons and daughters of God. You are
[1:01:51] restored to your inheritance. You're
[1:01:53] back to what God wanted you to be.
[1:01:55] You're a vessel he's working in. You're
[1:01:57] the super church. You're the super race.
[1:02:00] And whatever hinders you in manifesting
[1:02:02] the word is bred for you.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Anything that stops you from living this
[1:02:09] New Testament is bred for you. You're
[1:02:11] more than able to take it because this
[1:02:13] is your inheritance. The word of God.
[1:02:16] This is your promise.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, what has God called us not
[1:02:22] to go back and replicate a prophetic
[1:02:24] ministry, but to move forward? What's my
[1:02:26] land? What's my promise? What am I
[1:02:29] supposed to do? Well, Joshua, the Holy
[1:02:31] Ghost, in that day, he said, "Judah,
[1:02:33] you're over here. Ephraim, you're over
[1:02:35] here. Now, you guys can help each other
[1:02:37] take the land, but it's your
[1:02:38] responsibility to take your land. It's
[1:02:40] your responsibility to drive the
[1:02:41] Canaanites out, to kill them all, to
[1:02:43] possess the land." And now God has
[1:02:45] called some of us to be mothers and
[1:02:47] fathers and sons and daughters and and
[1:02:49] whatever station in life we are.
[1:02:51] Whatever your gender, what your gender,
[1:02:53] your job, your age, it doesn't matter.
[1:02:55] God has placed you there as a son or
[1:02:57] daughter of God to overcome in this age.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; And to overcome by what? To overcome by
[1:03:04] the word and the power of the word to
[1:03:06] live and manifest the word of God
[1:03:08] wherever your position is.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a toe, a toenail, a
[1:03:14] finger, an eye, an eyebrow, an eyelash,
[1:03:16] it doesn't matter where in the body you
[1:03:17] are, that's your position. You are part
[1:03:20] of Christ. And the bride as a whole is
[1:03:23] the body of Christ. And she is the
[1:03:25] manifestation of Christ. And you're part
[1:03:27] of that manifestation.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And now anything
[1:03:34] that would hinder you in manifesting the
[1:03:36] word is bred for you.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Right. Praise God.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; This is why it's such a fallacy to go
[1:03:44] back and try to repeat what we saw
[1:03:46] before.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Not going to go back to a tent campaign.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go back to a first
[1:03:53] second pull all over the world. I'm not
[1:03:55] going to go back to that because all of
[1:03:57] that came to bring me to the message.
[1:03:58] And the message came to put me in my
[1:04:00] position. And my position is to live
[1:04:02] this word wherever he has planted me to
[1:04:05] manifest the word every day of my life.
[1:04:07] Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; To pray for my co-workers, to lay hands
[1:04:11] on my children, to to manifest the word,
[1:04:13] to believe, whatever. If it's an
[1:04:15] obstacle, if it's hindering me and
[1:04:17] shutting me down and stopping for me
[1:04:18] from moving forward in the program of
[1:04:20] God, I'll speak to it and speak against
[1:04:22] it and push against it and fight that
[1:04:24] Canaanite off my land because we're more
[1:04:26] than able to take it.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we've had a mighty prophet
[1:04:30] who did mighty signs and mighty wonders
[1:04:32] to show a mighty sign. It was a super
[1:04:34] sign in that age. And the super sign was
[1:04:36] showing us that he's bringing back a
[1:04:37] super church, a super race upon the
[1:04:39] earth.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm part of it.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; I may only be that I only I may only
[1:04:47] have this much territory, but I'm more
[1:04:49] than able to take it.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And now it doesn't matter. Listen now.
[1:04:55] Now it's not about me having all the
[1:04:57] gifts. It's not about me having all the
[1:04:58] manifestations. It's not a oneman thing.
[1:05:00] Now, and now listen, they went in a many
[1:05:04] membered body into e into into the
[1:05:06] promised land.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And some of them could hurl stones with
[1:05:11] the right and the left hand.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Benjamin,
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; some of them could do this, and some of
[1:05:16] them could do that, and some of them
[1:05:17] could do that. And no longer do I have
[1:05:19] to have all the gifts working in me, but
[1:05:20] if I see it working you, I'm excited
[1:05:22] because that's part of the body. It's
[1:05:24] working in Christ. All the gifts are
[1:05:26] working. Amen. All the manifestations
[1:05:27] are here. The full life of Christ. I
[1:05:29] don't need it all in me. I just need to
[1:05:31] do my portion, my land, my territory,
[1:05:34] what he's given me to do. And if I plant
[1:05:36] wheat, I plant wheat. And if something
[1:05:37] comes and stops me from planting wheat,
[1:05:39] I'm going to fight against it by the
[1:05:41] word of God and the power that's in me
[1:05:42] because we're more than able to take it.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; So now I don't have to go and do what
[1:05:52] Zebulun does or what Issacher does or
[1:05:55] I'm just thankful that they do it. Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful there's somebody in the
[1:05:59] body with faith. I'm thankful that
[1:06:00] there's somebody in the body with the
[1:06:02] word of knowledge. I'm thankful there's
[1:06:03] somebody in the body with intercessory
[1:06:05] prayer. I'm thankful for every gift
[1:06:06] that's in the body because it's all here
[1:06:08] in Christ.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; But my job is to take my land.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; That's what every Israelite was
[1:06:18] commissioned to do in the message. Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; And if it requires the supernatural,
[1:06:25] then I expect the supernatural.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; If I've tried and I've done and I've
[1:06:30] done all I can do and it won't move and
[1:06:32] I can't get it to budge and whatever it
[1:06:34] is that's hindering me, I can't get out
[1:06:36] of my way, then I expect the parting of
[1:06:38] a Red Sea, the walking on water, the the
[1:06:40] the the stopping of the sun, or whatever
[1:06:42] it's going to take because I'm here in
[1:06:44] my commission, in the message believing
[1:06:47] that
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; I'm more than able.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:51] Praise. Praise. Praise be to God.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me see what I can do
[1:06:57] next.
[1:07:02] All right.
[1:07:06] And the super sign he says still remains
[1:07:08] as Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:07:10] today, and forever. The works that I do,
[1:07:14] if his life is in you, it'll manifest
[1:07:16] Jesus Christ. Now you all can't be that
[1:07:19] one. But you can be part of that with
[1:07:21] your faith.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; All of them couldn't be a Jesus when
[1:07:24] they was on earth, but they could
[1:07:26] believe him and accept the message.
[1:07:28] There was one Moses, one Elijah, one
[1:07:29] Noah on down always been that. But the
[1:07:32] rest of them couldn't accept it. And
[1:07:33] they would have had no ministry unless
[1:07:36] there had been somebody believe it.
[1:07:38] Jesus would have had no ministry unless
[1:07:39] somebody believe it. Paul would have had
[1:07:41] no ministry unless somebody believe it.
[1:07:43] And the Holy Ghost has got no ministry
[1:07:45] by the word today unless somebody is
[1:07:47] willing to get away from their creed and
[1:07:49] come back to the word again. No matter
[1:07:51] how well it's here and how real it's
[1:07:53] here.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost has no ministry
[1:07:55] unless somebody believes it.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe it.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; I I want to I want to skip over here to
[1:08:03] another
[1:08:05] another scripture.
[1:08:08] Let's go to Markap 11 verse 20. When
[1:08:11] Jesus Christ was on earth,
[1:08:14] he was the God man.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; He was the beginning of the creation of
[1:08:19] God. He was the super seed. He was the
[1:08:23] head of the super race. We all believe
[1:08:25] that.
[1:08:27] And he says, "In the morning as they
[1:08:29] passed by, they saw the fig tree dried
[1:08:31] up from the roots." What fig tree? This
[1:08:32] is the one that he went over to try to
[1:08:34] find figs on and there was no figs
[1:08:36] because it wasn't in season. And he
[1:08:38] cursed the tree.
[1:08:40] And Peter calling to remember saith unto
[1:08:42] him, Master, behold the fig tree which
[1:08:43] thou curses is withered away. And Jesus
[1:08:47] answered saith unto them, Have faith in
[1:08:49] God. For verily I say unto you, that
[1:08:52] whosoever shall shall say unto this
[1:08:55] mountain, Be thou removed, and be cast
[1:08:57] into the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[1:08:59] heart, but shall believe that those
[1:09:01] things which he say shall come to pass,
[1:09:03] he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[1:09:06] It's amazing. Jesus comes and he curses
[1:09:08] the fig tree and they come back and
[1:09:11] Peter and them they marvel and Peter
[1:09:13] makes note. Lord, that's amazing.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; that that fig tree is all dried up. And
[1:09:20] Jesus is standing here, the son of God,
[1:09:23] God in flesh.
[1:09:25] And he says, "Listen, don't marvel.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; You can do that, too.
[1:09:35] Listen, Jesus didn't just come
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; to be the great one.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; He came to show us what a son of God is.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't just come and
[1:09:46] sent by God just to be the great one
[1:09:48] that we all want. He come to showed us
[1:09:49] what an adopted son of God is.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; What what the first part of the bride
[1:09:54] that comes to harvest maturity looks
[1:09:56] like. He come to show us what the
[1:09:57] potentials are. He come to show us what
[1:09:59] it looked like to obey the word.
[1:10:02] And listen, in that obedience for the
[1:10:03] word, he didn't first get converted into
[1:10:06] a perfect man to show us what it's like
[1:10:08] to be a son of God. Amen. A restored son
[1:10:10] of God. He was still a human being. He
[1:10:13] still had complexes.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He still had a rejection complex. He
[1:10:18] still got tired. He still got worn out.
[1:10:20] He still had a nervous breakdown.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; He still lied and had to be corrected.
[1:10:26] He still was uh had selfish motives and
[1:10:29] wanted to run away from the ministry and
[1:10:31] he had to be corrected from by God. And
[1:10:33] God didn't lift him up there. Amen. To
[1:10:35] say, "Whoa, look at that suit." No, he
[1:10:37] came up, showed him says, "Listen, this
[1:10:39] is the potential. This is what it's like
[1:10:41] to be a son of God. This is what I'm
[1:10:43] bringing the church back to."
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; And then you say, "Whoa, Jesus. Wow.
[1:10:50] Look, you you cursed the tree and it's
[1:10:53] all dried up." And Jesus says,
[1:10:57] Listen, if you believe,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; if you just believe,
[1:11:02] listen, Peter, you don't know who you
[1:11:04] are.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; I'm demonstrating to you. Amen. In
[1:11:09] flesh, God in flesh. But Peter, if you
[1:11:12] don't doubt in your heart,
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; but believe what you ask for. You can
[1:11:16] say, not only this, but you can say to
[1:11:18] the mountain, be plucked up and cast
[1:11:19] into the sea. And brother Benham was was
[1:11:22] concerned with this scripture right
[1:11:24] here. Amen. when God come to him to
[1:11:26] create squirrels. Amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; He was meditating on this and
[1:11:29] contemplating that and he said he never
[1:11:30] preached on it cuz he didn't understand
[1:11:32] it and he he's he doesn't he's thinking
[1:11:35] about it and God comes to him and starts
[1:11:38] to tell him you can do that and starts
[1:11:40] to lead him in amen by God's leadership
[1:11:43] into speaking squirrels into existence
[1:11:45] and he speaks squirrels into existence
[1:11:47] and he finds out that this scripture is
[1:11:50] for the sons of God but the sons of God
[1:11:52] that are led by the spirit of God and
[1:11:54] when the spirit of God gives them in
[1:11:56] their heart Brother Bam said, "Whatever
[1:11:58] God can lead your soul to believe, you
[1:12:00] can have it."
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; But it takes the leadership of the Holy
[1:12:04] Ghost to lead your soul to believe it.
[1:12:06] Not whatever enters your mind, whatever
[1:12:07] is the lust of the flesh, lust of the
[1:12:09] eyes, pride of life, whatever you're
[1:12:11] trying to produce for some vain glory.
[1:12:13] No. But whatever God can lead your soul
[1:12:15] to believe, you can have it by faith.
[1:12:18] Why? Because you're a son or daughter of
[1:12:19] God.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; I want to look at one more.
[1:12:26] Matthew 14 26.
[1:12:30] And when the disciples saw him walking
[1:12:31] on the sea, they were troubled, saying,
[1:12:33] "It is a spirit." And they cried out for
[1:12:35] fear. But straightway Jesus spoke unto
[1:12:38] him, saying, "Be of good cheer. It is I.
[1:12:40] Be not afraid." And Peter answered him
[1:12:43] and said, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me
[1:12:46] come unto thee on the water." And he
[1:12:48] said, "Come."
[1:12:50] I love this.
[1:12:52] Listen,
[1:12:57] Jesus didn't say, "Peter, you know, you
[1:12:59] need to grow a little bit and you need
[1:13:01] to have
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus never made the supernatural hard,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; difficult."
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; He never made it far away.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; He never made it impossible. Yes.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Lord,
[1:13:21] if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on
[1:13:23] the water." And he said, "Come."
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't give him any instructions.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell him how to hold his feet.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come."
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Because Peter wasn't coming by ability.
[1:13:37] Peter wasn't coming because of the of
[1:13:40] the structure of his feet. Peter was
[1:13:42] going to move out by faith. Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Come." And when Peter was
[1:13:46] come down out of the ship, he walked on
[1:13:48] the water to go to Jesus. But when he
[1:13:51] saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid
[1:13:53] and began to sink, he cried, saying,
[1:13:54] "Lord, save me?" And immediately Jesus
[1:13:57] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[1:13:58] and said unto him, "Oh, thou of little
[1:14:00] faith, wherefore dst thou doubt?"
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, Peter Peter was uh Peter I
[1:14:09] don't know what made him say what he
[1:14:11] said.
[1:14:12] They were all astonished. They saw
[1:14:14] Jesus. They thought he was a spirit or a
[1:14:15] ghost. And he was coming walking on the
[1:14:18] water. And he said, "It's I. Be not
[1:14:19] afraid." And Peter said, "Lord, if
[1:14:21] that's you, Amen. bid me come." And
[1:14:23] Jesus said, "Come."
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; You know what he's saying?
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; You can walk on water.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, I I don't want to add to the
[1:14:32] scripture, but when Jesus said, "Come,"
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, I think it's safe to interpret
[1:14:36] that.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And we saw like for Jesus, this wasn't a
[1:14:40] big deal.
[1:14:43] And Jesus didn't think it was for him
[1:14:45] only.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; He come walking on the water. Of course.
[1:14:48] Well, he's the virgin born son of God.
[1:14:50] But he's every bit as much in flesh as
[1:14:52] Peter was in flesh. His body was
[1:14:54] affected by gravity the same as Peter's
[1:14:56] body was affected by gravity. He he ate
[1:14:58] the same food Peter ate. Amen. He had to
[1:15:00] sleep like Peter ate. He was just as
[1:15:02] much flesh. Only he was virgin born
[1:15:04] flesh as Peter was born flesh. And Jesus
[1:15:05] had no problem about walking on the
[1:15:07] water. It wasn't a problem to him
[1:15:08] because he believed. He had perfect
[1:15:10] faith. Amen. And when Peter was moved by
[1:15:12] inspiration and called out to God before
[1:15:14] he could think, he said, "Lord, if it's
[1:15:16] you, bend me come." And Jesus says,
[1:15:18] "Come.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; If I in flesh can walk on water, you in
[1:15:21] flesh can walk on water because you also
[1:15:23] are a son of God. You also have a gene
[1:15:26] of God in you. If you can believe it,
[1:15:28] you can do it." And when he got there
[1:15:29] and started walking on the water, Peter
[1:15:31] was actually walking on the water.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; By what? By faith. What kind of faith?
[1:15:38] supernatural God-given faith to a sea
[1:15:40] gene of God.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And when he looked around at the
[1:15:44] situation and the circumstances like the
[1:15:46] 10 spies did.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; He started looking at the wind and the
[1:15:50] waves and all the danger that he was in,
[1:15:52] all of a sudden he began to doubt. And
[1:15:54] when he began to doubt, what was he
[1:15:56] doubting? He was doubting the word
[1:15:58] because the person of the word said
[1:15:59] come. And if the person of the word said
[1:16:01] come, then he can come. And there's
[1:16:03] nothing that can sink him except if he
[1:16:05] doesn't believe the message. Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; But his faith in the word was what
[1:16:12] keeping him above the waves. But when he
[1:16:14] began to doubt the call of God, the
[1:16:16] commission the word, he began to sing.
[1:16:19] And Jesus says, "Oh thee of little
[1:16:20] faith, why did you doubt?"
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; That's what affected him in Kadesh
[1:16:26] Barnea. They saw the giants. They saw
[1:16:30] the cities
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; and they began to doubt the word.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:16:36] But I thank God for a Joshua and a
[1:16:38] Caleb.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; They can look at the same thing and say,
[1:16:42] "But we believe."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; We believe. Listen, they were they were
[1:16:48] ready to run in.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, they were ready to run across
[1:16:53] the Jordan into the promised land
[1:16:55] without a plan, without armor. They were
[1:16:58] ready because they believed that God had
[1:17:00] given them the land. They believed what
[1:17:02] Moses had told them. They believe it was
[1:17:04] the word of the Lord. They saw it
[1:17:06] matched the prophecy. They saw the
[1:17:07] vindication of God on this prophet's
[1:17:10] life. And now they saw the wilderness
[1:17:12] journey, all that God did. And when they
[1:17:13] got there, they believed the message of
[1:17:16] the messenger. And they were ready to
[1:17:17] go. And God preserved them and brought
[1:17:19] them into the land because they
[1:17:21] believed.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; I do not I do not just want to be a
[1:17:29] believer in the prophet.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; I want to be a believer in the message.
[1:17:34] Amen.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And the message is not God will send a
[1:17:39] prophet. God sent a prophet to bring the
[1:17:42] message.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; And the message is God wants to unite
[1:17:47] with you and I.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And he wants to live in you and I.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; I love these scriptures
[1:17:57] because it's
[1:17:59] it's not hard.
[1:18:02] But you say, "Brother Chad, well, I
[1:18:04] mean, I can't do it in myself,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; but whatever God can anoint my soul to
[1:18:12] believe.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; I can have it.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to make it work. I I
[1:18:20] don't I don't have a plan already. I I
[1:18:22] can't I can't tell you how I'll do all
[1:18:25] of that. And I also can't tell you where
[1:18:27] I was last. I forgot what slide I'm on.
[1:18:30] All right, let's go back here.
[1:18:32] the unveiling of God. He says like he
[1:18:34] was in Moses. When the word was in
[1:18:36] Moses, he was God in flesh. When it was
[1:18:38] in Jesus, it was God in flesh. See, only
[1:18:41] thing he done was change his mask, not
[1:18:43] his word, not his nature. He is the same
[1:18:45] yesterday, today, and forever. He only
[1:18:47] changed his form. He changed from Noah
[1:18:49] to Moses. He changed from Moses to
[1:18:51] David, from David to Joseph, on down
[1:18:54] till he come into the fullness of the
[1:18:55] Godhead bodily see. It's still the same
[1:18:58] God. Amen. I hope that gets through.
[1:19:01] See, it's the same God, but he just
[1:19:02] takes on another veil. See, he puts on
[1:19:04] another veil. He did it in the
[1:19:06] reformers. Taking on a veil. Taking on a
[1:19:09] veil until finally it come down through
[1:19:12] Lutheran age, down through the other
[1:19:13] age, then finally it comes out into the
[1:19:16] complete.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; What's that? That's a bride age. A a
[1:19:20] people standing on the earth at the end
[1:19:21] of time that he's living in fully.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Just before it comes, a prophet arises
[1:19:27] again. What it does is foreshadows the
[1:19:30] word shows back here revealing what's
[1:19:31] been done, what's been left off that the
[1:19:33] church will will not be without
[1:19:35] understanding. Then when this fades out
[1:19:38] then like John said, I must decrease, he
[1:19:40] must increase. Then all in all comes
[1:19:42] into him. What is that? Where does allin
[1:19:45] come? It comes into the complete which
[1:19:47] is the church.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; He is fully manifested through Luther
[1:19:51] Wesley Pentecostal age and on down on
[1:19:53] down he is fully manifested. Now you see
[1:19:56] he come down just the manifestation God
[1:19:58] unfolding. See him now notice fulfilled
[1:20:01] in his promise for this day as they had
[1:20:05] God unfolding himself all the way down
[1:20:07] until now he's in a many member bride.
[1:20:12] That's what he wants for this age.
[1:20:14] That's the message
[1:20:16] he says. Now notice now the same as now
[1:20:19] they rejected identified deity. Do you
[1:20:22] get it? They will certainly put their
[1:20:24] name on a church book and say, "I'll try
[1:20:26] to live by this creed." They'll take an
[1:20:28] oath by this. But when it comes to
[1:20:30] accepting deity and expressing back the
[1:20:32] same kind of gift they had, they did
[1:20:34] that you are identified by your gift
[1:20:36] that you give your entire being to it.
[1:20:38] It identified deity. Then you identify
[1:20:40] yourself with the deity by giving all
[1:20:42] you are what you are to deity himself.
[1:20:46] Now Christ in this day that we that we
[1:20:48] now live in see he's still identifying
[1:20:51] himself deity among the people. He's
[1:20:54] still deity because he is the word. And
[1:20:56] when we see the word living itself then
[1:20:59] we know that man can't do that. Let me
[1:21:02] go forward. It's deity. The word being
[1:21:05] made manifest by man. And Jesus said
[1:21:08] himself the son can do nothing in
[1:21:09] himself. I can't do nothing. I'm a man.
[1:21:13] Jesus said, "But my father that dwelleth
[1:21:15] in me, he showeth me all things that
[1:21:17] himself doeth." Amen. There you are.
[1:21:19] What is it? Deity be being identified in
[1:21:22] man. Now the same thing is today that
[1:21:26] deity the promise word for this day can
[1:21:29] identify itself in you.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then can you hold to it? Show that
[1:21:35] you believe in it. Give it deity.
[1:21:37] Believe it. believe it service and be
[1:21:40] ready to die out to yourself and to your
[1:21:42] own thoughts.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; I want to be ready to die out to give it
[1:21:46] service to believe it to hold on to it.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even Even Jesus when he was on
[1:21:55] earth,
[1:21:57] he said, "The word I speak is not of
[1:22:00] myself."
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But the father in me, he doeth the
[1:22:04] works.
[1:22:06] Jesus wasn't even taking credit in his
[1:22:08] flesh.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; But he said, "It's the life in me that's
[1:22:12] doing the works."
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; And neither can we take any credit in
[1:22:16] our flesh. But friends, it's the life in
[1:22:18] us doing the works.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's what will be the super race.
[1:22:23] It'll be God, amen, living in his
[1:22:26] children, his seeds come to life,
[1:22:28] himself manifest in the end time. It'll
[1:22:30] be him in us, not us, but him. And
[1:22:35] that'll be a super church,
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; a super race.
[1:22:39] That's what the words come to produce.
[1:22:44] I want to look at this scripture in Acts
[1:22:46] chapter 3 as we close. Acts chapter 3:9.
[1:22:50] And all the people saw him walking and
[1:22:52] praising God. This is when Peter and
[1:22:53] John went went by the gate beautiful and
[1:22:56] they they healed the lame man. And they
[1:22:59] knew that it was he which sat for alms
[1:23:01] at the beautiful gate of the temple. And
[1:23:03] they were filled with wonder and
[1:23:04] amazement at which had at that which had
[1:23:07] happened unto him. And as the lame man
[1:23:09] which was healed held Peter and John,
[1:23:12] all the people ran together unto them in
[1:23:13] the porch that is called Solomon's,
[1:23:15] greatly wondering. And when Peter saw
[1:23:18] it, he answered unto the people, "Ye men
[1:23:20] of Israel, why marvel you at this? or
[1:23:23] why look you so earnestly on us as
[1:23:25] though by our own power or holiness we
[1:23:27] made this man walk
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; they had just performed a mighty miracle
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; they had just taken a man who had sat
[1:23:37] there lame from his birth and from
[1:23:39] childhood and they all knew the man was
[1:23:41] there and they all knew he was lame even
[1:23:43] an argument broke out and say well this
[1:23:44] isn't him but it looks like him
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; this is just a look alike that can't be
[1:23:48] him we've walked past him every they
[1:23:50] knew he was there and then you You know
[1:23:52] Peter says gold and silver have we none
[1:23:54] but such as I have give I unto you in
[1:23:55] the name of Jesus Christ stand and walk
[1:23:57] and he stood and he got strength in his
[1:23:59] legs and ankle bones and went bones and
[1:24:00] went leaping and running and praising
[1:24:02] God. Amen. And they were so marvelous
[1:24:04] what they saw it drew attention amen to
[1:24:08] Peter and John. And Peter and John say
[1:24:10] why are you marveling and why look on us
[1:24:12] as though we by our own strength have
[1:24:13] done this? We haven't. And they go on to
[1:24:15] tell them this is by the name of Jesus
[1:24:17] Christ and faith in his name.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; But where was he doing the works? and
[1:24:22] Peter who laid hands on the man who
[1:24:24] spoke to him what flesh did he use? He
[1:24:26] used Peter's flesh but it wasn't Peter's
[1:24:29] life. It was Peter's flesh but it was
[1:24:31] the life of Jesus Christ through Peter.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; That was a super church.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; That was the original church where the
[1:24:38] original life Amen. through the
[1:24:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ had come
[1:24:42] back into the church. And now he's he's
[1:24:45] looking like like he's like why why are
[1:24:47] you looking at us?
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; As though we by our own strength. And
[1:24:52] Peter knew what he was.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, Peter hadn't forgot the
[1:24:56] forsaking Jesus. He hadn't forgot the
[1:24:58] cursing. He hadn't forgot the cutting
[1:25:00] off the servant of the high priest. He
[1:25:01] hadn't forgot what he was. Amen. But he
[1:25:03] had been born again by the power of God
[1:25:05] and received the spirit of God. And now
[1:25:07] there was another life living inside of
[1:25:09] him. And that other life was the super
[1:25:11] life.
[1:25:12] and the other the super life in him.
[1:25:15] Amen. Bringing the seed of God in him to
[1:25:17] life made him part of the super race and
[1:25:20] part of the super church because the
[1:25:21] super life was working through him.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; I mean even Paul and Barnabas they go to
[1:25:27] a place amen and they then there was a
[1:25:29] miraculous healing and all of a sudden
[1:25:31] the priest of the false gods amen they
[1:25:33] start coming to them and they say the
[1:25:36] gods have come down to us in the form of
[1:25:38] men.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they brought oxen and they
[1:25:41] were going to slay to them. And they
[1:25:42] called one of them Jupiter and the other
[1:25:44] one Mercury according to their gods.
[1:25:46] Amen. Why? Because they knew men can't
[1:25:48] do this. That has to be God. And they
[1:25:51] say the gods have come down to us. And
[1:25:53] they weren't far off the truth. But they
[1:25:55] had the misunderstanding because there
[1:25:56] was God men back on the earth again.
[1:25:59] There was people in the hands of God
[1:26:01] that God could live in and manifest
[1:26:02] himself through. And it was a super
[1:26:04] church. It was a super race. But it
[1:26:06] wasn't their superpower. It was his
[1:26:09] superpower.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God has called us in this end
[1:26:17] time
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; to be him. Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; To be him,
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; to be a people that he can dwell in, to
[1:26:29] be vessels he can fill, to be a church
[1:26:32] that he can pour himself into so that he
[1:26:36] can be made manifest in a many membered
[1:26:38] bride body.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; And it's he said it'll be a super
[1:26:42] church. It'll be a super race.
[1:26:46] How?
[1:26:48] by letting the word flow through us.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; It's going to take believing
[1:26:55] in the message.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; It's going to be believing like Joshua
[1:26:59] and Caleb believed.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; It's going to be believing. Amen. That
[1:27:04] what the prophet taught us about us was
[1:27:07] true.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:27:11] Joshua and Caleb,
[1:27:14] they knew Moses was a true prophet.
[1:27:18] And the 10 other spies knew that Moses
[1:27:22] was a true prophet,
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; It's not about believing about Moses.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; But Joshua and Caleb believed what Moses
[1:27:32] said about them.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And that made all the difference in the
[1:27:37] world.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; And listen friends, we believe God sent
[1:27:40] a mighty prophet in this age. Many
[1:27:42] people believe God sent a mighty prophet
[1:27:43] in this age. Amen. But that doesn't give
[1:27:45] me overcoming power. What gives me
[1:27:47] overcoming power is believing what that
[1:27:49] prophet said about me.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; And believing it's the promise for the
[1:27:53] hour. It's the word and it's God's will
[1:27:55] for my life and it's the position he put
[1:27:57] me in. And it's his power that's going
[1:27:59] to bring it to pass.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; God showed in Egypt when it's time for
[1:28:05] the word to be fulfilled, there's
[1:28:07] nothing that'll stop the word of God.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; When it was time for those children to
[1:28:11] come out of Egypt, there wasn't a
[1:28:13] Pharaoh. There wasn't an army. There
[1:28:15] wasn't a bondage. There wasn't anything
[1:28:16] that would stop that word. And so what
[1:28:18] did God do? God come on the scene
[1:28:20] through supernatural sign after
[1:28:21] supernatural sign to break the power of
[1:28:24] Egypt and break the power of Pharaoh and
[1:28:27] to bring the children out. And then when
[1:28:28] they got hemmed in and stopped by by a
[1:28:30] big body of water, he just opened the
[1:28:32] body of water. Amen. When they ran out
[1:28:34] of food, he sent mana. When the water
[1:28:36] was bitter, he turned it sweet. Why? Cuz
[1:28:38] it was time for this word to be
[1:28:40] fulfilled. And nothing was going to stop
[1:28:42] God from fulfilling his word.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And we've had a prophet in this day
[1:28:46] said, "This is the generation. This is
[1:28:48] the time. This is when he's going to
[1:28:49] have a super church, a super race back
[1:28:52] to the virgin bride that he was at at
[1:28:53] the beginning to unite with Christ so
[1:28:55] Christ could reproduce himself in a many
[1:28:58] membered body. And this is the time."
[1:29:00] And I tell you friends, anything that
[1:29:02] stands in the way of that word coming to
[1:29:04] manifestation has got to move.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. Don't get nervous.
[1:29:10] Don't run away. Just keep pressing
[1:29:13] forward. If it's water, it'll part.
[1:29:15] You'll go over it. You'll go under.
[1:29:17] You'll go through it. Who knows how
[1:29:18] we'll go around it. But nothing's going
[1:29:20] to stop this manifestation in this hour.
[1:29:22] It's going to be Jesus Christ manifest
[1:29:24] in her. And nothing's going to stop it.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And I believe like Joshua and Caleb,
[1:29:29] listen. I I Yeah.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; I believe he's talking about me.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm part of it. I believe
[1:29:38] anything that hinders my expression of
[1:29:40] Christ in this hour has got to go.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; If it's a complex, God's got to help me
[1:29:44] through it.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; If it's some weakness in my body, God's
[1:29:48] got to help it. If something, God's got
[1:29:49] to help me through it because I believe
[1:29:51] he's talking about me.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; And I believe when it's time for me to
[1:29:55] take my position that I'm more than able
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; if God be with me
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; cuz he said he would do it. Yeah.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't look unto me
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; like I've overcome.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; It was him.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And me.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's all stand together.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he good?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I love the word so much.
[1:30:21] So thrilled. Musicians, if you could
[1:30:23] come, please. Brother Peter and Sister
[1:30:25] Sharon, if you want to make your way
[1:30:26] around back, you can go ahead and start
[1:30:29] back that way.
[1:30:31] Let's bow our heads together.
[1:30:35] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful.
[1:30:37] Father,
[1:30:38] God, that you have given us such a word
[1:30:41] in this hour.
[1:30:43] God, we recognize by your word, by what
[1:30:45] your prophet taught us, by what you
[1:30:47] showed us in the scripture
[1:30:49] that God, you're looking for a people
[1:30:51] that will believe your word and
[1:30:53] surrender themselves to it. Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; And God, we recognize tonight
[1:30:59] that we've got to believe but more than
[1:31:02] your promise of Malachi 4,
[1:31:05] your promise of a prophet.
[1:31:08] But we have to believe the message.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; And the message has everything to do
[1:31:12] with us and our position.
[1:31:16] God, I pray that you would grant an
[1:31:18] outpouring of your faith. May your
[1:31:20] spirit come to quicken the word inside
[1:31:22] of us and make it live.
[1:31:25] we no longer doubt our position. No
[1:31:27] longer doubt what you said about us,
[1:31:28] Lord, but we would believe.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, I pray God that
[1:31:32] you would bless everyone who hears this
[1:31:35] word.
[1:31:36] God, may the Joshua and the Calebs rise
[1:31:39] up from within
[1:31:41] to come from that seed within us, Lord.
[1:31:43] That we would recognize, God, that this
[1:31:46] is for me, that this promise is true.
[1:31:50] And Lord, though it delay, though we go
[1:31:52] around and the horn again, it's not
[1:31:55] going to stop. Lord, it's going to be
[1:31:57] made manifest.
[1:31:59] Caleb's promised land was delayed 45
[1:32:02] years, but it came anyways.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Because he believed the promise,
[1:32:08] God,
[1:32:09] Abraham's promise was fulfilled 25 years
[1:32:12] later, but it came anyways cuz he
[1:32:14] believed your word.
[1:32:16] God, I pray that you'd help us to
[1:32:18] believe your word. Help us to stand on
[1:32:20] it with faith like Joshua and Caleb.
[1:32:23] Help us to lay claim to the promise.
[1:32:25] Help us to march forward boldly knowing
[1:32:28] that God, you will remove anything that
[1:32:30] hinders your expression in our life.
[1:32:33] God, you're asking us to have faith to
[1:32:35] go in, have faith to move forward, have
[1:32:38] faith to push against the boundaries,
[1:32:41] against the enemies, but you said that
[1:32:43] you would drive them out and then you
[1:32:46] told us to possess. So God, as we go by
[1:32:49] faith and possession, would you come
[1:32:51] behind us and drive out, Lord? Give us
[1:32:53] the power to overcome, for we're
[1:32:56] trusting in you, Lord, that you're going
[1:32:58] to keep your word and you're going to
[1:32:59] flow that word right through us. And
[1:33:01] it's going to be the word made manifest.
[1:33:04] Not our strength, not our power, but
[1:33:06] your word manifesting itself through us.
[1:33:09] We love you. We ask God that you would
[1:33:12] help us to surrender in a greater way to
[1:33:14] this word, to believe it, to hold on to
[1:33:17] it, to serve it, to yield to it, to
[1:33:21] allow deity room to work inside of us.
[1:33:25] We love you. We thank you for this word
[1:33:27] and ask your blessings in Jesus Christ's
[1:33:30] name we pray.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother John,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; we're live.
[1:33:38] We're living in the evening time. The
[1:33:42] race is almost through.
[1:33:46] God has chosen you and me. Still a job
[1:33:51] to do.
[1:33:54] The word that's been revealed to us must
[1:33:58] be prophesied again.
[1:34:02] And the message must reach everywhere
[1:34:06] till the last soul has come in.
[1:34:14] We are the generation.
[1:34:18] We are the culmination.
[1:34:22] Final voice that the world will hear.

[1:34:45] We are the chosen generation
[1:34:52] committed to the calling.
[1:34:56] Together we stand strong.
[1:35:00] Lifting up our voices as one. Sing the
[1:35:05] final song.
[1:35:08] God has chosen us to conquer in every
[1:35:13] test we face.
[1:35:15] And he has seen us through this far and
[1:35:19] will finish
[1:35:21] by his grace.
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:27] We are the generation.
[1:35:31] We are the culmination
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:36] that the world will hear. The coming of
[1:35:40] the Lord is near.
[1:35:43] Living out this revelation.
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:47] Overcoming sins temptation. The truth
[1:35:51] will go to every tongue and nation.
[1:35:58] We are the chosen generation.

[1:36:06] to the calling.
[1:36:09] Together we stand strong.
[1:36:13] Lifting up our voices. One. Sing the
[1:36:18] final song.
[1:36:21] God has chosen us to conquer every test
[1:36:26] we face.
[1:36:28] He has seen us through this far and will
[1:36:32] finish
[1:36:34] by his grace.
[1:36:41] We are the generation.
[1:36:45] We are
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; all nation final voice that the world
[1:36:50] will hear. Coming of the Lord is here.
[1:36:56] Living out the revelation.
[1:37:00] Overcoming sins temptation. Truth will
[1:37:04] go to every tongue and nation.
[1:37:12] We are the chosen generation.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:20] Oh, God bless you all. You can be seated
[1:37:21] for just a minute. Man, this is exciting
[1:37:24] day to watch for us, but it's a very
[1:37:26] exciting day for Sister Sharon and
[1:37:28] brother Peter. The Lord has taken them
[1:37:30] on quite a journey of late, but they've
[1:37:33] they've served the Lord with all their
[1:37:35] hearts to the best of their
[1:37:36] understanding for years. But when God
[1:37:38] came and showed them a little more
[1:37:40] light, they decided to walk in the
[1:37:42] light. Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; And so they want to serve God fully
[1:37:45] according to his word. And when they saw
[1:37:46] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:37:48] Jesus Christ, they wanted to obey. So
[1:37:51] here they are after being Christians for
[1:37:53] years serving God with their whole
[1:37:54] heart. God says, "You're my children.
[1:37:56] I'm going to take you a little higher."
[1:37:58] And they say, "Lord, we want to go
[1:37:59] higher." And so it's a thrill to to see
[1:38:02] them take this step. Sister Sharon, it's
[1:38:05] a privilege for me to see you come to
[1:38:07] full obedience to the word of God. And
[1:38:09] as God's drawing you and the Lord Jesus
[1:38:11] Christ is pulling you higher, it's
[1:38:14] exciting to see you fully obey his word
[1:38:16] to take his name in water baptism. And
[1:38:18] it's with a great privilege that I now
[1:38:20] baptize you in the name of our Lord
[1:38:22] Jesus Christ.
[1:38:27] Dear dear heavenly father, we thank you
[1:38:29] so much for this life, for your grace,
[1:38:32] for your mercy, for your love to draw
[1:38:34] her, Lord. Though she served you so many
[1:38:36] years, you said, "Sister, daughter,
[1:38:37] there's more I have for you." And she
[1:38:39] said, "There's more I want, Lord." And I
[1:38:41] pray now, God, that you confirm your
[1:38:42] promise and bring her all the way into
[1:38:44] the fullness of light and let your life
[1:38:46] flow through her and let her express
[1:38:48] this super race, this super church in
[1:38:50] this body of flesh. We ask that you
[1:38:52] would do it for her in Jesus Christ's
[1:38:54] name according to your promise. Amen.
[1:38:57] God bless you, sister.
[1:38:59] Amen. So, here is brother Peter. You
[1:39:02] want to scoot forward just a little bit
[1:39:04] to the edge. And and I'm so thankful
[1:39:07] that we've had a chance to fellowship.
[1:39:08] If you haven't got a chance to visit
[1:39:10] with these two, you're in for a treat.
[1:39:12] Amen. And now that they're going to be
[1:39:13] part-time citizens of Lima, we all have
[1:39:15] more opportunities. So, Brother Peter
[1:39:18] loves the word. absolutely loves I mean
[1:39:21] he asked some of the most wonderful
[1:39:22] amazing questions and we have the best
[1:39:24] fellowship and so he too loves the word
[1:39:27] of God so much that when he saw the word
[1:39:30] was and baptism was different he said I
[1:39:33] want the word
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; not what I've had not my tradition but
[1:39:36] I'll take the word and that's a thrill
[1:39:38] to my heart to see that there's people
[1:39:40] who love Jesus Christ that much that'll
[1:39:42] obey his word
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; so so Peter because the Lord has drawn
[1:39:46] you and opened more of himself to you
[1:39:49] and you desire to take his name in
[1:39:51] baptism. It's a privilege for me to
[1:39:54] baptize you in the name of our Lord
[1:39:56] Jesus Christ.
[1:39:59] Oh heavenly father, I lay hands on my
[1:40:01] brother as the saints of old did. God,
[1:40:04] praying God that you will bless my
[1:40:06] brother's obedience. Lord, as you've
[1:40:07] drawn him by your spirit, I pray you
[1:40:10] fill him to overflowing and use him as a
[1:40:12] light wherever he goes. And God, may
[1:40:14] this that you've poured in him pour out
[1:40:16] unto others, to his family, his
[1:40:17] children, and all that's around him. And
[1:40:20] use him, Lord, like you've promised to
[1:40:22] use him. May he become a shining light,
[1:40:24] a bright ember, Lord. And may he go out
[1:40:26] testifying of your goodness and your
[1:40:29] grace. Bless my brother, and use him for
[1:40:31] your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:40:33] pray. Amen. God bless you, my brother
[1:40:37] Peter. God bless you all. You can stand.
[1:40:39] Thank you.

[1:40:49] through me,

[1:40:55] see. I know that day is near at hand.

[1:43:57] Oh, but while we walk this pilgrim
[1:44:01] pathway, clouds in the over spread the
[1:44:06] sky. Oh, but when traveling days are

[1:45:08] when we all
[1:45:11] see Jesus
[1:45:14] sing and shout the victory.

[1:45:39] when we all

[1:46:12] see Jesus.
[1:46:15] Sing and shout the victory.
