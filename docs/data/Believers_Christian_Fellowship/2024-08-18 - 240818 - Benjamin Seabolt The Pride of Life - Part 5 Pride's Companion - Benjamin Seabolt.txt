Father we just love you this morning Lord we just worship you this evening or this morning Lord for you're certainly worship certainly worthy of our worship and of Our Praise Lord you've been so gracious father not just to send us truth in this age but to bring us truth yourself in this age father and not only that but you've been gracious and you've passed over billions of people father billions of people father to come by our way by your grace to open our eyes father for what good would truth be if we didn't have eyes to see Lord but you've been so merciful to us you've been so gracious to us father and I would would just pray that you would come this morning Father that you would just let us be still Lord that we can hear your voice Lord for we're not here to see each other as wonderful as that is we're not certainly not here to hear what a man has to say Lord way would just ask that you would come and do what no man can do but that you would just pick up this book and that you would loose the seals father and that you would feed your children we just want to commit ourselves to you that you would have your perfect will and that you would accomplish what you've ordained to accomplish this morning Lord that we could just as the song says just settle ourselves and that we would be quiet and that we would receive what you have to say we ask this in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride says amen God bless you this morning going to invite you into the scriptures to the book of Philippians appreciate the atmosphere this morning I believe the atmosphere is conducive for God to move for God to say what God wants to say brother brandom says without an atmosphere you can do nothing so we certainly want to welcome that Philippians [Music] 2 beginning verse three let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliest of Mind Let each esteem others better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient un death even the death of the Cross God bless you as you would have your seats I would just like to continue with this thought on the pride of life and I'm not certain but I think this might be the wrapping up portion of that but I would just like to speak on the pride of life with a subtitle of Pride's companion Pride's companion 1 John 2:15 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world for If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world I'm going to read this quote probably getting very very familiar with this but as I've told you time and again this is kind of where this thought and inspiration spurred from so I just want to read this quote and then we're going to go into fresh material 1953 and go tell my disciples brother says speaking of Mary Magdalene so she had Seven Devils cast out of her pride and envy and she thought that she was so pretty and that there was no one like her so again brother Brandon brings the definition of pride to us and he readjusts our standard to what we may have thought Pride was but a prophet comes on the scene and reveals the true definition of that that she thought she was so pretty and that there was nobody like her but when Jesus spoke and said be thou clean all that left her she became a new person she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own sight but she wrapped herself in the robe of meekness and gentleness and followed the master so a prophet no doubt theologians have studied this scripture for decades and centuries wondering what these Seven Devils were but then we have a Prophet come on the scene and starts revealing what these Seven Devils were and he says pride and envy so we immediately get two of them and I don't know if you remember or not but when I very first preached on Pride I had mentioned that if anybody found out what the other ones were to please tell me and a brother did the day after I preached on Pride and then he still tried to tell me and convince me that he loved me like I'm not ready for the other ones quite yet you know just maybe in a couple weeks you can let me know what the rest of them are but I want to read you this quote out of 1962 speaking of the same individual and the same situation and brother brandom says Mary recognized his position that day when she came out and said if you would have been here my brother would have not died and he said thy brother shall rise again said yes Lord in the resurrection he was a good boy Jesus said but I am the resurrection believest thou this and she said yay Lord I believe that you are the Son of God that was to come into the world he says Where Have You buried him the conf confession yay Lord I believe that you are the Son of God that has come into the world is immediately followed by the question where have you buried him you've been calling me you have been seeking me you've been wanting me to come I've asked you a question you have as we would maybe say you have said the right thing because there is no more delay after this confession Jesus immediately goes into action where have you buried him oh he says there you are she recognized it that little woman wasn't saying that she had Seven Devils cast out of her she knowed the power of God that could take pride and stress and everything away from her that could take that little self selfish high school spirit out of her and make her a new creature a little selfish high school spirit what we would view as maybe annoying or immature the prophet says is a demon a demon a little selfish high school spirit I have no authority to say what a little selfish high school spirit is I have have my ideas I'm sure that you have yours but I would venture to say that we could probably all recognize it when we see it but I've studied this for months now prayerfully wondering what does a prophet of God mean he can use any vocab any vocabulary that he wants any verbiage that he wants to describe this demon that was cast out of Mary but he would classify it as a little self selfish high school spirit and again I'm No Authority but just what spoke to my heart is when you look at an individual that's coming out of high school this is an individual who's not a toddler they're not a necessarily a juvenile but this is an individual who has just accomplished something that the required to do this is an individual that's accomplished something and done something before they can move on in life and this is an individual at this stage and I can remember you know when I was in school you know they would have guidance counselors and life planners and all that but this High School stage of life is when I would venture to say you're now qual qualified to do something and you having to make the decision of what you're going to do with your life prior to this you really don't necessarily have freedom to do with your life what you want because you got to go to school but now here at the end of this there's this Liberty that you know is coming that you can start making decisions and you can start plotting your course in life yeah and a prophet Taps into this and says that this demon that was cast out of Mary was a little selfish high school spirit this spirit that would get on a person in a juncture of life to where they have to start making decisions for themselves that they have to start making life choices the culture and the educational system is geared to force you into these decisions if you could just do the lights a little bit more brother that would be helpful thank you it is focused and geared the whole educational system is to force you into making a decision to force you into a life's course to force you into a path of a of an occupation your whole education is for an occupation you've you've now got to take what you've got and now you've got to do something with it and you're wired this way and you score this way on a test and you have these certain responses and this is the best direction for you to go but a prophet would say that it's at this juncture of time this High School juncture of time that there's a selfish Spirit a demon at work and I don't know about you because I quit Public School in seventh grade and homeschooled the rest of the time graduate way to top of my class thank you very much also bottom of my class thank you very much but when I was in public school I never had one guidance counselor or one life planner ask me have you prayed about what you think you should do with your life not a one the single most important thing to do at at that juncture of time to approach God prayerfully with what he wants me to do with my life is not mentioned a single time in that program and it gives way and makes way for this demon to start working because it's a pressure and it's a push and it's a force that you've come to this point and now you've got to do something like you just can't sit around and figure this out you've got to move forward you've got to get into school there's scholarships to be applied for there's vocational schools to go into there's there is never any emphasis on how about we just settle down for a second and let's get quiet for a moment and if at this juncture of time in life we better make sure that we get this right because if we start out on the wrong Fork here we may find ourselves 10 12 years down the road realizing that we've got a little selfish high school spirit on us and that because we didn't approach God prayerfully and because we didn't get quiet and we didn't get settled before him and we had selfishness laying in our heart about what we wanted to do and we saw that we had career skills to match that and we had education to match that and we had the willpower and the work ethic to facilitate that that now we're 10 12 years down the road and we're on the verge of a new promotion and we're on the verge of a pay raise and we find ourselves now questioning is this where he even wants me to be or not that's right all be all because we you all just ignore my emotions this morning okay I'm not trying to get you emotional it just is what it is but I don't I don't want to do away with emotions either because brother Brandon says when you get feeling the way that you're feeling right now it's because you're bumping at Angels there's a lot of angels up here on this platform this morning evidently but this is real and this is serious this is a demon at work this is not just a bad decision that we've made and this is not just a rush decision that we've made this has been orchestrated and pushed by demon forces by demon Spirits yes by selfish demon spirits that we so easily sweep under the rug and make excuses for yes sir but we bypass the one thing that can help us and the one thing that can make sure that we start out right to approach it prayerfully and to say not my will Lord but thine be done and we find ourselves decades later down the road having to go back and correct things having to start over again this is not just true in our occupational but how many marriages because they didn't do this first but was approached with a little selfish maybe hangover high school spirit or a demon that didn't want to go anywhere after high school and because you thought you could you had the World by the tail and that you were free now and could make whatever decisions you wanted to and maybe you even had a driver's license you could drive anywhere you wanted to and now this demon is still lurking this demon is still laying there and now we enter into a relationship with this and we're not entering into a relationship prayerfully and by Revelation but we're entering into a Rel relationship selfishly and then we find ourselves years into a marriage wondering what's going on what's wrong what happened I thought I loved her I thought I loved him I thought they loved me but we look back when when I say we I'm not saying I'm in this position I'm just preaching spir principles okay so like me and my wife's fine aren't we [Laughter] honey I'm just preaching spir principles I'm not necessarily speaking to IND individual circumstances yet but we would enter a relationship selfishly maybe entering that relationship of without prayer not by Revelation and even carnally not what I can do for that individual how can I fulfill that individual's needs and heart's desire but what can they do for me what are they fulfilling for me and then we wonder why it's wrecked up 56 down the road is because it was built on a demon of selfishness of what they can do for me how she can be pleasing to me how she's the prettiest so I have to have her how he makes more money than this guy so I I need that he has a more stable Foundation right then this guy that the Lord is kind of tugging in my heart toward so I'm going I'm going to go this way instead for selfish for stability and I'm not against stability I think we need more of it but for selfish reasons we would enter into that relationship and we would make a choice based on what we need and what we want and what is comfortable to us and now we've failed to deal with that demon as we left out of high school and we find that demon now in our in our marriage in our relationship and then kids come along and this demon is still lurking and now we think we're going to be the proper parent to these kids when we still got a selfish demon laying inside of us and we can't even view the situation appropriately of how can I minister to my children it's just how can these children do something for me and we so easily dismiss it as he's just hung up on himself he just thinks a little too much of himself he's just a little self-centered no I think it's time that we start using the terminology that the prophet used and I think we start identifying it for for what it is this is just not a bad characteristics characteristic to have attached to your uh name this is a demon that needs cast out and this demon is Pride's companion because everywhere that Pride goes selfishness goes brother br indoors IND doors he says that the doors are actually side by side when you walk out a Pride's door selfishness door is right there he said they're side by side when God's trying to do something in your life and cast Pride out of your life selfishness is there trying to pull it right back in they're attached together and that got to be dealt with because if we don't we're going to find ourselves on a career path we're not supposed to be on in a relationship that we're not supposed to be in raising children the way they're not supposed to be raised and then they're going to do to their children what they saw you do just ask just ask Isaac why do you think Isaac was willing to sell off his wife to save his own hide CU that's what he saw daddy doing why did daddy do that the man was willing to give up his wife to save his own hide it don't take much spiritual discernment to realize what spirit and what demons work there Abraham the founder of the faith had a little selfish high school spirit laying there that needed to be dealt with and because he didn't he now has to watch his his son end up in the same circumstance that he was in with his wife selling off his wife to save his own hide he says but she knowed the power of God that could take pride and stress there's the other there's the fourth demon but we're not going to get into that this morning pride and stress I'm going to touch on it just real quickly but where do you think stress comes from stress brother Brandon says the birds don't have any stress cuz they know they have a heavenly father that takes care of them so if the birds don't have any stress the flutter birds not the birds sitting back there the flutter Birds they don't have any stress because they know they have a heavenly father that will take care of them why do you think that you have stress and we will so easily dismiss it say that's just the culture we live in that's just the age we live in it's just that I'm busy it's just no it is a demon right amen that is working on you failing to get the Revelation that you are a son or daughter of God and he'll take care of what I have need of stress brother brandham says is the worst thing a human being can carry stress will kill you literally kill you stress will reverse all the natural functions of your body and will literally shut your body down all because we won't take the time to get quiet and settle ourselves and come to the proper Revelation I'm a son or daughter of God and I don't know what's the answer to this and I don't know what's going on and I don't even know why but I have a Heavenly Father that will take care of me we'll maybe deal with that some other day she had Seven Devils cast out of her she knowed the power of God that could take pride and stress and everything away from her that could take that little selfish high school spirit out of her and can make her a new creature 1954 the word becoming flesh brother random says and I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming up in me this has got to be bad right I mean this is the seventh messenger seventh Church age messenger seventh a vile Angel Malachi 4 I mean this has got to be pretty bad I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming up in me and saying this man is wrong I ought to tell him about it yeah that was pretty much my reaction as well talk about a standard being readjusted I recognized a selfish Spirit coming up in me and saying this man is wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong God is the one to tell him about it that's none of my business altars open if God revealed to me the man was wrong with righteous indignation i' be sure to make sure that I told him where he was wrong at he's wrong obviously it's God's will for me to tell him that he's wrong God don't want his children in error no brother brandom says that was a selfish Spirit a demon trying to get him to stick his nose in where it didn't belong if God tells you to go tell your brother that he's wrong go tell him if God don't tell you keep your nose out of his business and pray for him don't give way to a demon spirit that you need that's right you need to go tell him where he's wrong right let me ask you why do you need that's right really why do you need to be the one to go tell him that he's wrong why don't you just pray earnestly that God will speak to him through the preaching of the word why do you need to be the one to go tell them where they're wrong I have heard but now I see the Holy Spirit showed me a great crack in the earth and that it was full of oil and these outflows in Kentucky was just little beds of that that they were pumping from but this one came from the main stream and I said brother Deus it's there so they went down searching for it and they said go down and tell us where the oil well is and I said oh no no no no see we don't use the gift of God for commercial he sees a vision big gusher of oil tells the brothers who's in the oil industry there's one there go you'll go find it it's there go tell us where it's at brother random go tell us where it's at no no no no no we don't use a gift of God for commercial gain for commercial purposes he didn't say that he couldn't he says we don't I think we could draw from that if we draw for that draw from that it gets real easy to discern if somebody's got a spiritual gift that they're using properly or not yes because if there's any aspect of using it for commercial gain or I'll say for commercial for commercial loss to prevent commercial loss it tells me that it's not being used properly or if it's being used to predict the political world or other carnal things that we can benefit from carnally brother brandom says we do not use a gift of God for that it does not say that we can't use a gift of God from that for that he just simply says to properly use it we don't do that he says he could tell me where it was at but I don't have any need of it I wouldn't even have faith enough to to ask him I know I'm going slow but if I just blow through this and preach it we're going to miss it because we've heard these things before we know these principles but we've got to take time to be quiet and settle down and really get it if it if I had need of it I believe if I'd ask him he'd tell me But first you see your motives and objectives have to be right you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to it to be in the will of God see you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed this is the rubber meet and the road Saints we're talking about a promise of God the children bread and brother brandom says you properly can't have faith unless you first know why you want your healing what are you going to do if you get if he does heal you why are you asking for this healing is it so that you can oh boy I ain't going there I'm also going slow because I don't want to get in trouble this morning as brother brandom says it can get real Pinchy and I don't want to make sure it's not me talking I want to make sure it's him talking cuz it's real easy to get carried away with these things once you see the principle and just to blast it and if that needs done we'll do it but I don't want to be the one to do it if he wants to come and blast something this morning let him come and blast it but I want to make sure that I go a little bit slower this morning that I don't get caught up and do something that's not appropriate why do we want to be healed why what are we going to do if he heals us if it's just so that we can be healthy to continue a carnal hobby I don't know that that's the right motive and objective maybe we shouldn't be able to participate in that softball league like we want to maybe I'm stopping there you all get the point you all can deal with it maybe it's just so that I won't lose my balance when I'm climbing up in my tree stand now you can't say that I'm just preaching at you why do we want to be healthy why do I need this muscle in my shoulder that's tore healed so that it doesn't hurt when I pull my B back what is my motive what is my objective I believe he'll do it if I ask him but what is my motive what is my objective you know if you decrease your bow poundage it's easier to draw but if you decrease your bow poundage your arrow slows down and if your arrow slows down yardage estimation in the white tail Woods becomes critical and now if you hold an inch low you may completely miss that deer at 300 ft per second you won't but if you reduce your bow weight because you have a tore muscle in your shoulder see the the shoe starts fitting a little bit better than what we like what is our motive we are approaching the Throne of God to invoke the name of Jesus Christ on a promise that he died for amen and my motive is so that my arrow speed won't have to drop so that I don't have to worry as much about yardage estimation when I'm hunting I think I need to maybe dig a little bit deeper than that I think I maybe need to find a little bit more justification for that I'm going to stop there before what happens with pride happens with selfishness and I have a self-counseling session for the next two hours but we so easily skip over these things because we know he's a faithful father and if we ask him he'll do it but we don't think about what we're doing we don't realize the serious iess and the magnitude of what we're doing and that this is something that he that cost him his life for him to have the ability to supernaturally heal my shoulder or any other part of my body cost him stripes on his back cost him a spear in his side and we just approach it Friv usly if we ask him he'll do it don't matter the reason I think we need to get that selfish Spirit off of us and I think we need to take it as serious as it ought to be taken he says when the brothers got down there one fellow went over and bought a bunch of stuff and sold leases and cheated the other one he's still speaking about these men in the oil field and cheated the other one this way he said you see it won't work now just to make the prophecy sure within a hundred yards of where these men were digging their well some man struck the big gusher but because of the selfishness that got among it the objectives was wrong signing up a bunch of stuff saying that it would be this way when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God but looks like like it's for themselves right now my understanding of that as these brothers approach brother brandom they're in the oil industry brother brandom has this Vision there's a big gusher of oil in Kentucky they said praise God we'll go down we'll do it and the whatever comes out of this we're going to use it for the kingdom of God and he says when they actually got down there they started making contracts and selling leases and doing everything but for the kingdom of God he says and it and it won't won't work no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask and he starts quoting scripture if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence 58 Queen of Sheba the medical doctor will say well don't you pay attention to that surgeon the surgeon will say you need an operation not a sugar pill and both of them would say the chiropractor don't have nothing to do with him and the chiropractors have nothing to do with the osteopathic person and they'll all say have nothing to do with the preacher you know what I think I think it's selfish motives because we all know that medicine does good surgery does good Chiropractic and osteopathic does good and so does the preacher look if they had the right motive we would all go arm in arm to do everything we could in our powers and our ability to make the Journey of our Pilgrim friends a little more happier as we go through life anything different from that is selfishness and any motive by money or something else behind it that's right brother Rand says if these individuals in the medical field would get this demon of selfishness out of them and quit worrying about their pocketbook and would really be concerned about the patient and the well-being of the patient they could all join together and in this case you know what we think a chiropractic would be best let's hold off on a surgery for now and in the next case we'll look at this and say look we we've done all we can for you in chiropractic care we really think this operation could help you if they would all work together for the well-being of the patient it would work because the motive and objective is right you know what's shocking about this and extremely sad is brother brandom says this is the way ministers are says the evangelist will say about the teacher H he's just dull and boring he needs a little bit more emotion the teacher will say about the Evangelist he needs to simmer down a little bit a little too loud a little too emotional very shallow very shallow the prophet will look over and say you all can't see anything like I see it the Apostle will say what are you all doing you need to get busy why are you sitting around don't I mean you you all haven't left your home Church in like 3 days he says but if the ministry will ever get over themselves that's my words not his but the principle is the same if they will ever get over themselves and deal with this demon of Pride and this demon of selfishness of I need my Ministry to be the most important and focus on the patient then we'll see the Apostle going out and establishing people and establishing works and turning them over to a pastor and saying I've done all I can do for you here's somebody who can help you and the pastor won't have to have every re Revelation that comes along he'll say you know what that brother there he's got a gift of teaching in his life and I think he can help my sheep right here and the pastor will say there's this situation in my church and I just don't know how to deal with it and he'll go to prayer and an evangelist will come on his mind and the Evangelist will come in and deal with that problem and 14 others sir harshly harshly harshly no way near the way that a Shepherd would handle his sheep but it's needful but if the pastor will sit there with a critical spirit and every comment the Evangelist makes be like well he never even finished the thought I can really preach on this subject because I'm wired as a teacher so when you come up and you make a point and you don't finish the thought out I'm like Lord help me now Look I said I was wired toward towards your teacher don't think that I'm making something of myself remember there are professors that are teachers and there are kindergartener teachers so I'm not putting myself on where I'm at on that scale I'm I'm just saying I'm wired that way to take things and analyze them and um you all probably realize that on Wednesday nights when we're here at 10:00 but he says if they can ever have the right motive and right objective and be comfortable in what God has called them to be then they don't need to be the most important then they don't need to be recognized as something they don't need the people to be mainly attracted to them and they can focus on the need of the person they can focus on the need of the congregation and they can do their part and then they can say you know what I've done all I can do in this situation we need a pastor to settle this out when I preached it I was probably a little too hard on it we need a pastor to come in and settle that out you know what when I got into that topic when the other day when I was preaching I left a lot of loose ends we need a teacher to come in and tie up some of those loose ends settle the people out settle them down give them a proper understanding oh Lord help me why do we need to have all the Revelation and be the one that says it why do we need that it's selfishness it's selfishness why do I need to get a complex when I tell the pastor before he goes on vacation that I'm going to preach on selfishness and then brother Emanuel decides he's going to come preach on selfishness and brother Gabe decides he's going to come preach on selfishness and Brother Kyle decides he's going to come and preach on self-love why should that bother me what do I have to say anyhow why do I need to say it first right why do I need to have something new if Jesus Christ can stand there and say verely verely why can't I come and say what brother Emanuel said and what brother Gabe said and what Brother Kyle said why do I need something different I'm to the point that I will read and I will pray and I will never prepare for a service until everybody's done preaching because it's come to the point it's useless they will literally come and preach Verbatim what I have written down and that does not make me spiritual that just means that God has been so gracious to us that he has opened a channel so wide that even a fool would not air therein I've went this far I might as well go farther why does a minister have to beg and plead with God to give him clear Direction and inspiration before he gets to the pull pit is it so that we can properly minister to the people or is it just because we don't want to look like a fool when we get there what if I get up there and I've got nothing to say what if he don't show up and I just have the sat there and stuttering yes be like I don't have a clue what I'm doing and I got nothing until he shows up I think we ought to beg and plead and seek the face of God before we come to this pull pit but what is our motive for it don't you all worry I'll get off of preachers here in a little bit and preach about you I mean this is really the rubber meeting the road why am I tore up for four and five days beforehand pleading with God for direction pleading with God for a whiff of inspiration pleading with God what scriptures what quotes what direction is it some that I can be in the proper Channel and that I can be in tune with his spirit and that I can Minister properly to the needs or is it just so that Benjamin seabolt don't look like a dumb hillbilly when he gets up there who has no spiritual life and obviously hasn't been in prayer and reading the word cuz he ain't got nothing to say and he certainly ain't got nothing new to say brother Emanuel already said that and Gabe said that Kyle said that the Pastor said that before he went on vacation see we it's not the mechanics that are wrong right it's just we need to really deal with why why am I invoking the name of Jesus Christ God almighty to take time to come and inspire me to speak to a people if it's just because I don't want to look like a dumb hillbilly when I get up here he has no obligation for me not to look like a dumb hillbilly when I get up here none that's what I am I'm a dumb hillbilly why does he have any obligation to make you think differently so if I approach him selfishly with a demon of selfishness laying in my spirit realm just because I don't want to look like a fool when I get up here I'm even violating scripture because the scripture says it's by the foolishness of preaching that Souls will be saved why am I seeking God so that I don't look like a fool praise the lord it's the truth anyhow it's the truth anyhow but don't leave it up here take it to work with you are you in prayer and in the Bible and in the message just so you can go tip fort with the coworker and not take a chance of them tying you up to where you can't have an answer for something you believe or is it because you're in love with him and you want more of him in you so that you can give an answer for the hope that lays within you that by per chance a coworker would need help you could minister to them and if that backslid Baptist who don't know nothing about the prophet throws a scripture at you and you have to sit there and stutter and be like uh I don't know how that correlates I don't know I I why can't you tell them you don't know why do you have to have all the answers what is our motive what is our objective we should be ready to give an answer for the hope that lays within us but God is not obligated to answer in your prayer life for more Revelation because you're wanting more Revelation to be able to win the argument at work no obligation there but I challenge you and I dare you to come and tell me that he's failed you one time to progress you in Revelation when you invoked the name of Jesus Christ before his throne seeking Revelation for your spiritual growth because you were in love with him and because there was Souls that needed to be saved and that there were people that needed to be ministered to and I need answers to give to a world that has no answers tell me one time that he's failed that he never has and he never will this is scriptural Matthew 7:22 many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have not we prophesied in thy name and have in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from you depart from me ye that work iniquity he did not correct them and say no you did not you did all those things you prophesied you cast out devils and you did Mighty wonderful Works none of that's the problem the problem is their confession did not we yeah yes did not we did not we we do something depart from me I never knew you if they would have been doing it by his working and not laying the claim and the glory to them he would have known who they were yes I wonder how many things we have done for God in the name of God how many things have we done and there's no disputing that we done it my question is did we do it or did God do it and I don't have the answer for that and probably none of of we have the answer for that until we get to this time period but at this time period when he said to apart from me I never knew you ye that work iniquity they knew who was doing it all that good stuff they knew then what the motives and objectives were they knew then that they had yielded to a little selfish prideful high school spirit Luke 14 then he said unto them a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at supper time to say unto them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse and the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five yolk of ox and I go to prove them I pray have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so the servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the Halt and the blind there was an invitation given and there were excuses made what is profound to me is that when the Master of the House instructed his servant who to go get the ones that he instructed him to go get could not have the excuses of the other the first excuse was I've bought a piece of land and I must needs go and see it the first person that Jesus told the servant to go out and get was the poor if you're poor you ain't got no money to buy land to take up your time to distract you from the wedding supper that's right so you tell me which is better to be rich and have land and miss the wedding supper or to be for or to be poor and have the servant compelling you to come the next one said I have bought five Yol of ox and I go to prove them the second one that was compelled to come was the maimed if you're maed five yolk of ox is going to do you no good you can't run them anyhow right so you tell me would it be better to be maimed or be able to work the fields of your land with five Yol of ox and miss the wedding supper the next one says I've married a wife and therefore I cannot come the third and fourth characteristics that uh the master seeks is the Halt and the blind if you're halt which means you can't move and you're blind sorry to tell you your chances of getting a wife's pretty slim and if by chance if by chance you find one you're not going to miss the wedding supper on her behalf because you can't move and you're blind so you ain't going to do her no good to stay home anyhow the excuses that were made were directly rebutted by people who we would view as poor them Lord help them they got so many problems you know what they didn't have near as many problem as the people who missed the wedding supper I would rather be poor maimed Halt and blind and have the servant compelling me to get into the door then I would have all the money in the world healthy as can be working like a horse a beautiful wife and end up missing the wedding supper It's a Wonderful Parable isn't it Saints there's been an invitation given there has been an invitation given am there's even been a servant here compelling us to do anything but don't miss that what's our excuses we can leave it in a parable but what's our excuses I oh Lord help me I'm not a prophet so I'm not going to prophesy but I'm just going to make a statement and you hold it in your mind I don't think the squeeze is going to be us losing the ability to aircondition our homes I don't think the squeeze and the tribulation period is going to be us losing finances and not having the ability for a soft Easy Living I'm just not buying it I wonder based on this Parable I wonder sometimes if we've got it too good I'm not even going to talk to you anymore I'm going to talk to me I wonder sometimes if I've got it too good I wonder if I don't have too many excuses because we've got a little money in our pocket and we can buy something and when we buy something then it distracts us and it takes up our time I wonder if I would have been better off not to have the money to buy it and I'm not talking sinful things I just about started going down a list but I'm not going to I'm not talking about sinful things I'm just talking what this Parable is saying I wonder I wonder if that man who bought that piece of land in the parable wouldn't have looked looking back on it wouldn't have sold it or just let it go for one more chance to go to the wedding supper I wonder if that man who not bought one but had money to buy five yoke of ox I'm not a prophet so I can't interpret it but I'll throw you what I think this man had work ethic this was a hustler this was a man who was getting it done he not only had one he had five yok of oxs to work there is no doubt this man was plowing some Fields I wonder at the end of that Harvest when he had plowed all his fields and he had seed all his seed and he had reaped all his Harvest and his barns were full and he had money in his pocket and he went home to his beautiful wife I wonder I wonder when the death rattles was in his throat if he wouldn't have gave it all up for one more chance to go to that wedding supper I wonder what my excuses are Saints because there's been an invitation given 1 1200 and some times not counting the ones in the scripture there's been an invitation given the spirit and the bride say come but I wonder if we don't have a little demon lane somewhere of selfishness that because we have a little bit of money or because we have a little bit of health or because we're in a relationship or seeking a relationship carnally that we bypass the time and the opportunity to enter into a communion and fellowship and a wedding supper with our Lord there's not a single person in here that wants to Mi miss that wedding supper sir you don't even have to raise your hand I know there is not a single person in here who wants to meet Miss that meeting in the air and that wedding supper but you remember brother brandom says Dimensions doesn't change your character if we're so willing to miss supper with our Lord on a daily basis communion with him on a daily basis are we really ready for that wedding supper when we can't even sacrifice to make the physical wedding Supper once a month at the local assembly yes we're saying we want to get to the wedding supper we want to get to the wedding Feast I can't wait to be and we can't even sacrifice one Sunday evening a month to make it here remember brother Brandon says Dimensions does not change your character the way the tree leans the way the tree falls why why would we miss that it's selfishness there's something else that you've deemed more important to you than to be here at Showdown time and look I'm not talking Vacations or you you miss like once a year we're taking you out from underneath the blood like you all understand what I'm saying I hope that's The Showdown time that's the rubber meat in the road that's when you're taking the symbol of the body of Jesus Christ and looking your wife in the eye and looking your family in the eye and saying all is well the blood's on the door come what may this month the death angel come if he want the bloods on the door we're okay in this is all that we have need of the stripes have been paid the the price has been paid the stripes were on his back the blood has been shed I've accepted it I'm declaring that publicly before the church and now when we go to prayer time in our families now when Calamity arises and we invoke the name of Jesus Christ I'm not going to have that in the back of my mind you know what last communion entertainment was more important to me than Showdown time making an extra couple bucks was more important to me than Showdown time I had a man ask me one time about the speed limit you all pray for me because I'm getting way off my notes but he was asking me about the speed limit and he was you know saying well you know I don't and this is a good brother so if he ever hears this you're a good brother I love you he's a fine Brother but we was just talking in conversation and he was like you're really you know legalistic about the speed limit like if it says 55 you're not at 60 like the five Grace you know and I said look I'm not fanatical about it if you're driving down the road and it's 55 and you look down and you're going 60 like I don't think you're going to die and go to hell like just slow down like I'm not you don't have to drive 54 for fear of going over 55 like I'm not that way about it but we know the principle that lays there and we know what the prophet taught about that and I said yeah I am he's like that is interesting like I just I said listen brother you do what you want to do I said here's why I do it is I've been in situations before that I needed to touch the Throne of God and I'm not talking about tomorrow and I'm not talking about an hour from now I got to touch the throne right now and I don't want in the back of my mind popping up of some stupid little law I don't want to say that forgive me I shouldn't have said that some simple some simple little law that I could have so easily kept but in my stupidity thought that me being in a hurry was justification to violate that and it's not violation of the law that I'm fearful for it's now I know I'm in violation of his word and now I'm approaching the throne and now I know the scripture says if my heart condemn me not I have faith before God I said that's why I do it brother has nothing to do with me worried about getting a speeding ticket I don't want a speeding ticket but I'm not really concerned about getting a speeding ticket I'm worried about my heart not condemning me that's right when my wife calls me and says hey we've had an accident William needs prayer I don't want to have to go back through a whole list of things to repent of silly things little foxes that spoiled the fine before I can go to the throne I want to say honey it's okay it's okay William would be just fine what if it's urgent what if I don't have time to go back and make it right and now one of my children is suffering cuz Daddy couldn't keep his foot off the gas pedal and knew better it's not a about legalistic Saints it's about is my selfish desire to get somewhere quicker or not to look bad for showing up late more important than keeping the word of God and if it is where's that selfishness coming from is that just a bad characteristic that I need to change or is that a demon at work I have no idea how I got there but praise the Lord and it's not you know that's an easy one that we talk about because it's so simple we do it every day but you all have your own examples what about that $100 the guy paid you in in cash and you didn't report on your taxes I'm sorry but don't approach the throne of God knowing you cheated on your taxes and think he's obligated to answer you yes could you get by with it sure you can get by with it at what cost okay you got an extra okay I don't know what the percentages are because I'm not an accountant but whatever taxes are let's just say it's $25 you had to pay $25 in taxes on that $100 so you saved in your pocket $25 and sold your right to approach the throne of God that doesn't even make good sense no pun intended that doesn't even make good sense but we'll so easily bypass those things some of you are sitting here saying brother I wish you'd get over onto the seals or the trumpets or the vials I am I am it's called a white horse rider called a slight deviation away from the word that has to be combed by the pure word of God roaring back at it we are preaching the seals this morning don't blame me if you can't hear the thunder I was so thrilled when Brother Kyle was preaching Wednesday and he was talking about his neighbor coming over to him he T give her the example about the bonfire and then I know what you were meaning brother so don't take this the wrong way but then he made the comment he says we don't have to break the seals to everybody I I was sitting there I was like brother you broke the seals to her I know what he was meaning like we don't have to take time go through all the s but she was in spiritual famine and he told her the answer if you're in spiritual famine you need some oil and WI M you did break the seals to her brother true you may not have said anything about a black horse rider but there was Thunder of God going forth the seals were being broken because your barire runs out of wood and in order for it to keep going you need to put some more wood on it that's literally exactly how brother Brandon broke the seals literally in those what we would say silly little Parables that he would tell beforehand that's how he broke the seals and the people were sitting there the whole time oh what's the symbol mean what's the symbol mean what's the symbol me and it's already thundered the seal has already been broke you know I was out shooting my gun the other day and it was slightly off the target the seal was being broke but they didn't catch it but when we preach simple things like this Saints it's not because there's not a deep meaning and I'd venture to say you can have all the Deep Theology and understanding that you want and if you still can't do the simple things of obeying the laws of the land and paying your taxes and giving to Caesars what Caesars what good is that going to do you when you show up there anyhow you're going to be the Rich Young Ruler that says Lord Lord I've done all that since my youth well actually you won't be the Rich Young Ruler because you haven't done it since since your youth but you're he's going he's going to say okay but that's not the point the point is have you done what you really needed to do have you really sold out yourself to me have you done the simple thing that you could have done of getting rid of all your Earthly possessions and following me so as the scripture says it's the it's the small foxes that spoil the vine it's these simp things that we need to deal with that we need to root out and that we need to bring to the surface I want to make a statement you take it for what it's worth the price you may have to pay for truly giving your all to Christ there is a price to pay that comes with that I will not deny that but I assure you it will always be less than the price that you will pay if you don't give your all if you hold on to a little bit bit of selfishness and not pay that cost not pay that price whatever price that is one day you will have W you will wish that that's all you had to pay one day you'll want to just pay that price again even maybe even double that to not have to pay the price because you didn't give all I may be guilty of a lot of things I may be guilty of a lot of things but the one thing that I never the one thing that I never want to stand before my children and have to admit is that we're in this condition and we've got this problem because daddy didn't want to pay the price of doing what was right daddy didn't want to pay the price of giving up something I may be guilty of making mistakes no doubt I am no doubt I will be but I don't want one of them Youngs to come look me in the eye and say Daddy if you would have just done this we wouldn't be in this condition right now and furthermore I don't want to wait until that time to pay that price because no doubt there's going to be interest on that I want to take time to settle myself and to be quiet and examine my soul for any little selfish high school spirit that may be laying there in any aspect of my life and I want to deal with it now before I've got to pay that price plus interest Luke 9 says let these sayings sink down in your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be the greatest and Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receiveth shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great and John answered and said Master we saw one let me stop there I'll get to that in a second you'll notice this started out they're walking around his disciples which wondering which one's the greatest of them and I know we've discussed this before but you tell me what motivated that you tell me how many little selfish High School Spirits was motivating that these are the Disciples of Christ following God around God in flesh and he's telling them the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men and the scripture says they understood not this saying why do you think they didn't understand what he was saying cuz they're too busy trying to figure out who's got the best Ministry who's the greatest no wonder they can't figure out what he's saying 49 John answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbid him because he followed not with us and Jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us this is John John type of the Bride is so stuck on himself that he wants to shut down healing campaigns because they're not associated with him that's right true I'm venturing to say I'm venturing to say that John didn't take time to settle himself and quiet himself and check his motive and objectives before he written and rebuked the brother and shut down his healing campaign you know what's terrifying about this is this selfish little selfish High School demon doesn't just stay in the natural and the carnal he's religious you can't do what you're doing for the kingdom of God because I haven't okayed it they're not at a ball game Saints they're not in a barroom they're not in a dance floor they are conducting the ministry of Christ and they come across the healing campaign and show shut it down because of a little selfish high school spirit that they haven't okayed it so it must not be okay surely if that was of God we would have known about it surely if this was of God we would have something to do with it surely if this was of God don't be helping the people brother I'm Excuse me I'm not getting any credit for what you're doing so please stop this is astounding to me like how do how do you get to that point how do you get to that point don't answer that yet because I got a couple more questions for you the blind man that is healed this is a blind man from his birth he's healed and the only thing the scribes and the Pharisees can say is that's clearly not of God because he did it on the Sabbath and who is that guy anyhow were they really concerned about who he was and what he was doing or were they concerned about their position being threatened why were they asking the question who made you whole who healed your eyes how did he do it was it because they really wanted to know so they could duplicate that or was it because they were concerned that you know what this guy's kind of got something we don't have and there is a lot of people interested in it right and we really need to put that new addition on the temple and we came up 20% short on the offerings this month because they were out with this guy what was their motivation what were they concerned about by asking their questions this the lame man that was healed same thing they couldn't even be happy for the poor guy right true this is a man who hasn't walked in years and now he can walk and he can rejoice and they can't even say praise the Lord we're happy for you who did this when did he do it he did it on the Sabbath he's clearly not of God he's a devil why would why did he have to be of the devil they hadn't even talked to him they hadn't even figured this out they haven't even say why did you do this why did you do it on there is no investigation but there's a verdict why because they needed that to be true you have Mary come with the alabaster box break it Judah says that's a waste we just lost all that money that we could have given to the poor we don't even have to wonder about the interpretation of this because it's written right in the scripture he said it because he was a thief at heart not that he cared anything about the poor there's two men possessed of devils Jesus casts them out and they go into a herd of swine run off a cliff there is no focus on the neighbor in the neighborhood about these two men who've been possessed of devils for year are now free clothed sitting in the right mind listening to a man talking about the gospel praise God let's have a party no the only concern is we ain't going to have no more bacon our pigs are gone our livelyhood is threatened right pigs versus two sons of God right pigs livelihood livelihood is what those pigs were rubber meat in the road you may not be a pig seller but how many times have we taken and chose our livelihood not being threatened over something that God's doing or something that God wants to do or a move that God wants us to make can't do that it'll threaten my livelihood Jesus tells a man follow me follow me God in flesh comes by your way and invites you to follow him and the man's response is can I stay and wait for my father to die and then bury him and then come with you he's more concerned about his relationship with his Earthly father than he is with God why selfishness it wasn't just a bad decision it was a demon at work it was a demon Jesus responds if he would have if we would say this nowadays we would be stoned Let the dead bury the dead follow thou me what if your pastor said that there's something that God needs doing but my parent is sick this is time sensitive it's for the kingdom of God let the dead bury the dead that would never fly nowadays would never fly nowadays Jesus didn't pull any punches with him you know why because he knew where his problem was at he knew where his problem late is this man is attached to his Earthly relationships rather than his heaven heavly his spiritual relationships and unless I deal with that first and unless he can overcome that first there's no need in him following me right but I find this so astounding that John would come across the healing campaign and and be so blinded by his own selfishness that he would shut down a healing campaign because of what he wanted that a blind man from birth can be given his sight and the only thing somebody's concerned about is when a man did it and how he did it and that he did it on the Sabbath like how can we not just be rejoicing that this man can now see how do we miss that part of the picture how can this lame man be made whole and we're not happy for him we're instantly looking for a way to condemn the man who did it and shut down that Ministry even evil people like you would think that just carnally you would grasp this of like look God forbid me if something's been done wrong but this man's been made whole God for forgive me if something wrong happened on the Sabbath I don't understand maybe everything the mechanics of it but praise God this man can see now Lord help me understand how it's permissible to do like I'll ask some questions okay I'll ask for understanding but you would just think conly your initial reaction would be to be happy for the person but when a demon comes in a demon now you say and you do things you would just not normally do that don't even make good human sense that's right because it's not just about bad characteristics it's a demon these individuals did not start out this callous there were selfish decisions made before they got to this point we don't want to get to the point that we're so callous that we cannot view things that just don't even make good common sense and take a wrong reaction to them we want to catch the white horse rider not the Pale Horse when he's coming or the black we want to catch this on the Forefront and lay before God and examine our hearts and root out any demon of selfishness that will be there we look at this and we would say these people are not even in their right mental faculties and I would say yay and amen to that but just because we're the bride doesn't mean that we can walk down the same path that that they walk down and make selfish decision after selfish decision after selfish decision and think we're not going to end up like that now by his grace we'll never end up on the Pale Horse I believe that that's by his grace but you can sure ride the black the the legs off of that black horse by making those kind of decisions and you can sure miss God's purpose in your life and being a help to your brothers and sisters and to this lost and Dying World by making those decisions like that and you can end up outside of your right mental faculties by selfish decisions they did not start out at that point Saints they ended up at that point through selfish decisions through protecting their livelihood through protecting their Prestige through protecting their position we can take this attitude and I know the quote's been mentioned here a few times of because we think we're bride that we're exempt from those things that we're exempt from sowing Bad Seed and reaping Bad Seed let me tell you I don't care whether you're bride or not your flesh has not changed yet right keep drinking two Mountain Dews a day and see what happens to your body right keep eating a court of ice cream every day and see what happens to your body I prayed over my Mountain Dew before I drink it what you're trying to do is bypass the man anointing remember brother Bram says the man anointing was just good common sense god-given knowledge they brought the the communion out and and said this is the literal body and blood of Jesus Christ and Luther said uh no it's not it's symbols what we do when we take that approach is we try to bypass the man anointing and go straight to the eagle anointing and just fly over a problems you can not bypass god-given sense to get to an eag anointing you can't bypass what you know is wrong or what you know to do that's right and just think he's going to anoint you with wings of eagles to fly over top of everything and that your body is not going to be subject to that that's right mistreat your body and see where you end up is there a promise of healing yes try approaching the Throne of God for the promise of healing after you've done something you know you shouldn't have done that's going to hurt your body where is your faith you first have got to come to Godly sorrowfulness and repent of that before you can ever approach the throne for healing and it's not that he won't heal you because he knows that we're Fallen human beings and he knows we're going to do things wrong and we're going to make mistakes and brother Randon says we're even going to willfully do things wrong not in our soul but caught up in our flesh and our spirit Realm and even then in his Mercy he'll still come and fulfill his promises but that is not the age that we live in Saints we are to be living in a bright age in a harvest age in a maturing age as our brother Kyle was talking about and why are we so mature that we can bypass good common sense of how to take care of our bodies which by the way the scripture says know ye not that is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and think because we're bride we're exempt and we're not going to reap bad bad seed or bad a bad Harvest when we've sewed Bad Seed there's been Decades of medical reports about what soft drinks does to your body and I'm not here to preach about soft drinks quite frankly I have no idea why I'm talking about soft drinks and I'm not saying if you have one every now and again that your body is going to fall apart and that you're lost I'm just saying don't think because you're the bride yeah that you can bypass common sense and then expect things to go okay you're going to find yourself broke up somewhere that's right yeah we have common sense to know that it's probably not appropriate to eat the whole pack of Oreos he has given us common sense to know how to possess our beings to possess our bodies God help me we will seek God for healing for back pain for years and the doctor has told us for years you need to lose weight but because we're selfish we won't want to change our eating habits and we won't do do what the doctor is that we went to the doctor for good advice and he gave us good advice and we won't do it and we because we're bride we're expect no possess your being possess your Tabernacle you say well that's easy for you to say you're a skinny little string bean Hey listen Lord have mercy I have no idea why we I'm sorry Pastor you got a lot of cleanup to do tonight and I'm preaching about weight on a potluck Sunday I am done I'm done I don't there's no coming back from this what I was going to say is you say it's easy for me to say that because I'm skinning whatever listen 2 years ago my back was hurting more than usual my church clothes were getting tight I've shared this with a c couple of you so don't start laughing yet I went and got on the scales and I was 168 lbs I have never been over a buck 50 never since like seventh grade never you say well Buck 50 168 not so much a big deal I'll say yeah maybe a point having to go shopping for a new church clothes is a big deal not happening not happening shoot me now I am not going church clothes shopping I was 168 and it snuck up on me and it was because I was setting more in what I was doing for work I was not as active and I was away from home a lot so I was eating out more and I'm a West Virginia Hill belly so when I pay for food I eat the food it doesn't matter if it was three times more than what I should have ate I am a member of God's bride it did not change for me and it will not change for you after two years of doing that I've got 18 pounds on me that shouldn't be on me 18 pounds percentage wise compared to one 150 of what I should have been is a huge percentage like I said I'm a dumb Hill belly so I can't tell you what that percentage is some of you already know what it is all I know is it's way too much but it snuck up on me I didn't realize that's what was happening and I was still exercising and you know running and you know doing my thing so I thought I was fine but I wasn't compensating for overeating Time After Time After Time After Time After Time I get a belly on me what happens when you start leaning forward more than you should your back's going to start hurting more than it should I get on the scale I'm 168 I said that is not happening I can deal with this I am not buying new church clothes I quit eating bread and I stopped overeating I did not drink some magical Miracle Juice I did not even have to use essential oils I stopped Ting and I quit eating bread I lost 15 PBS over like eight months I felt great said this is you know feeling really good I went on a three- week fast you say impossible no it's not I had to work my way into it slowly cut back what day I have no idea why I'm preaching this but praise God I slowly started cutting back on what I was eating four or five days your metabolism starts slowing down your stomach starts slowing down I'm not a medical doctor so I can't explain the process all I know in order for me to fast I have to work my way into it through three or 4 days by slowly cutting back what I'm eating day four or five I can shut down completely drink water maybe eat an apple every once in a while 3 weeks I was down to 138 felt amazing you know the one thing that I only did one time I never got asked God to heal my back pain and I never asked God to take this weight off of me supernaturally miraculously I knew God had laws and I knew God what God had revealed to me and I knew if I used common sense in the man anointing that he would anoint me with the wings of Eagle to fly over this problem and he did within a year I've lost 30 PBS I've gained a little bit of that back because I've went back to eating probably stuff that I shouldn't and probably overeating a little bit but I'm at 149 and I don't plan to ever get above that because again we're not going church clothes shopping it's not happening sorry if you don't like this suit and my two other ones but that's all you're going to see you may see a new shirt every once in a while but that's it but I say that because I'm not preaching against sizes you God brother Brandon says God makes us all different shapes and sizes and Heights and whatever i'me I'm preaching principle of don't try to get to an anointing when you're bypassing a man anointing in good common sense and try to invoke that I bride God has to do something special for me when I'm violating all of these laws that he's laid before me the root of that is selfishness selfishness furthermore don't come pleading your case to the Saints Time After Time After Time After Time I need healing I need healing pray for me pray for me pray for me when you haven't even done what you know good and well you should do to take care of your body and when you haven't even touched the throne yourself for your own healing that's selfishness selfishness you pray for me you pray for me you pray for me why don't you pray for yourself you know why because you don't have confidence to do it cuz your heart's condemning you because you know good and well you're violating the principles of God and you have no rights to that promise don't don't come trying to plead the blood you're just wasting Lord I got to stop I know that's harsh Saints I'm sorry I don't mean it to be harsh I am truly sorry but the principle is true you stick your face in social media for eight hours a day you stick your face in entertainment Time After Time After Time After Time and then come invoking the prayer of the Saints because you're in spiritual famine and you need God to deliver you from this and that this and all these demons in your head don't do it it's selfishness get your face out of social media get your face out of the television get your face out of Hollywood and then if those demons are still lurking around we'll deal with them and we'll deal with them with faith but not because you're violating all the principles of God and what the prophet has taught you to keep your nose out of that stuff don't think because you're bride and I won't say you're not cuz I'm not to judge if you say you're bride I believe you're bride but don't try to say that because you're bride you can do all of that things and it won't make you lose your mind it will amen you are not exempt from that I am not exempt from that those demons are real and they will take your sanity and your wellbeing away from you and it's not just the social media Saints oh Lord I've preached about weight on a potluck I guess I can preach about anything but you sisters on Snapchat and WhatsApp do you know every time that that phone goes ding it releases a hormone in your brain and it releases uh cortis not cortisone whatever it is you all can figure out what it is it releases a hormone and what that hormone does is it brings excitement and it stimulates you and you oh I got a message somebody cares about me somebody wants to talk to me and now you have that 250 times a day and wonder why you can't settle down and sleep at night is because you've overloaded yourself with WhatsApp messages talking about what clothes you've got to sell and what's going on in the neighborhood and want to say well I'm bride I should have peaceful sleep at night follow the principles of God and you will it's not just social media Saints I am becoming more and more and more and more convinced that these things right here are of the devil I get case after case after case after case of people having people following them and stalking them and harassing them and putting chips in their brain and listening to conversations they've had and when I go to their house and I talk to them and they want me to check their house for listening devices and cameras and blah blah blah blah blah they can't even put this thing down while I'm there constantly feeding that through that and then they wonder why they're hearing voices and why they think people's stalking them well it's probably because you did 25 searches about the toaster oven on Google and now it's wanting to sell you a toaster oven yeah not somebody listening in your bedroom we cannot do what the world does and expect a different result than the world am our flesh is still hybrid it still has to change and we still are obligated to under the laws of God at the bottom of it is selfishness we want to feed that demon of entertainment so we'll do it and then we'll pray for the side effects not to come if you have faith in that prayer I have no idea how and you certainly don't after today amen under that six seal the things that are coming on this Earth brother brandham says are not real they are in the person's imaginary mind you treat your imaginary mind your spirit realm your eyeballs watch the same eyeballs that everybody in the world does everything that the world does and think that you're not going to be one of the ones seeing bats with long hair flying around chasing you you've swed the same seed you're going to get the same result if you're sitting here today with mental oppression and depression and anxiety I would tell you the first thing you need to do is get rid of this and I'm not saying fanatical I run a business so I'm tied to mine I can't give it up but I'll tell you what I will that I will guard against is when I pick this up it's for business purposes it's not so that I can spend eight hours seeing whatever is on whatever like you can't even pick it up and there's something coming into it they're trying to sell me women's clothing I've never shopped for women's clothing CL and why do I need to see ads for women clothing you know why is because if they'll show me an ad for a woman's clothes maybe there'll be something there that'll catch the lust of the eye it's not cause Satan thinks he's going to get me to buy women's clothing it's because he wants me to see something that will catch the lust of the eye and now we go down at don't oh you're bride you're exempt from that right no you're not the prophet carried a cross in his car and looked at it so that he wouldn't have wrong thoughts right never said the wrong thoughts didn't come it's so that he would look at that cross and remember and Corral them and bring them under subjection to the word don't think Facebook ads and social media ads and Google ads and that you're exempt from that it'll take you down a trail you don't want to go down that's true and Satan will do it because he knows it works he wouldn't be trying to do it if he didn't know that it wouldn't work I got to move on the point is don't sew Bad Seed and expect good crop even if you're bride be honest with God be real with God come through all the anointings apply the pure word of God apply the ox anointing of giving up your will to the pure word of God apply the man anointing Lord what can I do what is my remember brother Rand says you have a part to play that's right there's something you can do yes sir Lord what can I do to fulfill your word in this situation and Lord now that I've done everything that I know to do you've got to come and pick me up above this situation you have got to supernaturally come on the scene and help me amen if you will come through those first three anointings you'll have no problem getting help from the fourth one cuz he's a heavenly father that loves us that will do that I've been lengthy but if you'll bear with me just let's stand up for a second let's stand up I'm too far into this to stop and do another service so if you'll just change your position get your blood circulating I'll I'll wrap this up shortly I promise but I don't just want to leave this right here in the Sixth Seal brother random says now the fifth seal Matthew 24913 so this is when he's going back and forth and comparing the seals that were in Matthew when Jesus was speaking about them to where they are in Revelation he's comparing the the scriptures back and forth and he's he's reading from Matthew he says and then shall the deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and he says there you are he's talking about the fifth seal and then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you there you are and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophet shall rise and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that endures to the end the same shall be saved now we're on the fifth seal now and that was last night see so you see what he's tying it to this scripture in Matthew of their of them killing you he says they will deliver you up betray one to another now let's get that one Revelation 6:9 now he's moving into the Book of Revelation on the fifth seal and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long Lord holy true dust thou judge and avenge our judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now and white robes were given to every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now you see under the fifth seal we find here martyrdom and under Matthew 29 249 to13 we find also that it was martyr they shall deliver you up and kill you and so forth see the same seal being open so he comes to the Sixth Seal he's reviewing the fifth seal and he's saying there you are see it's killing it's martyrdom in the church age book brother random says but the crown spoken of here in Revelation given to the Martyr is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life The One Crown is for those who have striven the other is for those who have given both crowns are Incorruptible they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joys of the plot and of the world their Glory will fail but those who give their lives for God either by either by daily striving remember this is the fifth seal we're talking about either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the Crown of Life all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints as you would have your seats so he's talking about the fifth seal and he's saying that it's directly tied to marome you said I just thought that was the Jews under the altar the martyrdom it was but brother and brings in another Crown of Life and he says the same crown that those are given is the same Crown you will be given if you catch the Revelation under this fifth seal and daily give your life you receive the same reward right you see well I thought the fifth seal was the souls Under The Altar and Heavenly representation and it is an election and God's grace g r a c e 5 Grace but listen to this paragraph 3:19 the fifth seal five if you know your numerous of the Bible five is the number of laboring Grace we knew it was the number of Grace laboring Grace and that's what he has done now watch you want to know where it is was Jesus a labor of Grace j s u s 5 l a b o r is that right labor for love for you and if you get to him how do you come by what F AI t h n l a b o r faith in labor is the Revelation one of the revelations under this fifth seal that will bring you to a Crown of Life the same crown that the martys received faith in labor labor labor in what daily striving not my will but thine be done that's the labor that Christ did not my will but thine be done also known as giving up all selfishness amen selfishness under the fifth seal I thought it was deeper than that it is right but it's also as simple as that amen faith in labor the Thunder underneath the seals 1959 all the days of our life brother Brenham says I trust that the church will understand this that we have no right to use our own thinking about things when we become Christians we totally surrender every bit of our mental powers to God and follow after his leading and as long as we try to go after our own feelings then we are using the Fallen state of the being I trust that the church will understand this that we have no right to use our own thinking about things 1963 the token he says and you are not yourself no more you are Christ remember we're talking about selfishness a demon of selfishness and how do we combat that remember you are not yourself no more you are Christ you don't think your thoughts you don't think your thoughts you say I think you have no thought coming that's pretty much exactly opposite of everything our culture teaches us it's all about what you think and how you feel that's right and what you want to be today a prophet says a Christian doesn't have a thought coming you say you think you have no thought coming the life that was in Christ is in you the mind that was in Christ is in you the works that was in Christ is in you and Christ himself is in you you are dead your life is hidden God through Christ sealed him there by the Holy Ghost you are not your own I think we need to grasp a really firm revelation of that we were bought with a price and I'll remind you that that price was the literal blood of God and we want to think that we have a thought coming and that we have a decision to make you are not your own you were purchased with a price your decision is only to lay down your decision and seek what his decision is amen that's the only rights that we have I want you to listen to this quote it's out of Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's very very familiar to us and we're going to skip over a couple of the paragraphs just for time sake but I want you but we so often reference this we so often reference this but I want you to hear it with your ears here this morning um go ahead brother Franco now for a text I want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire Bible but I wanted title this Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ being the mystery of God revealed now uh took it in order as a Sunday school lesson so we could all read together and and uh have this Fellowship together now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive and doing it in order to let himself be expressed so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living so we're all familiar with this I want to highlight a couple things for a text I want to take out of there this morning basing it upon the entire Bible you ever heard a theologian talk like that this morning I'm going to base what I'm going to say on the entire Bible he says now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind not just in his mind but back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was trying and going to achieve now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak to the church on this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began now I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but in your heart I want you to really really honest before God as you know how ask yourself do you believe what this man's saying do you believe this minister is standing before a group of people in 1963 and has the ability to speak about the entire Bible in one service and reveal to the people what almighty God had in the back part of his mind before there was anything I'm not asking you to say Amen I'm not asking you to raise your hand I'm asking you in the deepest part of your soul that you can get into do you really believe that I mean really really truly believe that this is a bold statement there is no no man ever made a statement like this do we really believe that I find it astounding that people will tell me they believe that and then conduct their personal lives in a way that is opposite of other things that that Minister taught and say well I think that might have just been his opinion it would have been better for you never to have confessed that you believe he can tap into the back part of God's mind the moment you confess that you believe he has the ability to tap into the back part of God's mind you ain't got no thought coming I have no thought coming now if I don't believe that you still got a thought coming think whatever you want but the moment that you admit that God in his grace and in his Mercy not only sent us a gift but he sent us a prophet and came himself and was so gracious and merciful that he would let a minister stand and speak in our own language and say that I'm going to reveal to you this morning what God Almighty had in the back part of my of his mind and something Rings true in our heart and we say yay and amen I'm going to listen I think that he can do that all selfishness is done there is no more covering for it because let me ask you this what if it was just his opinion do you have a better one honestly you don't even have to respond responders during this time of the service I'm not even going to ask for it I want you to answer that question what if it was just his opinion do you have a do you think somehow that you have the capability to have a better different opinion than a minister that tapped into the back part of God's mind do you think for one second somehow you have a better idea of what's permissible in marriage and divorce right I had a brother ask me this and it just blew me away he says what do I do what do I do when I come to these parts of the message and I just don't necessarily agree with what brother brandham is teaching I can't help that person I can't help them because I can't sympathize with them I have no ability to understand what they're saying right and I do not say that to lift myself up I can just only say that by the absolute mercy and grace of God but I can stand here before you with an honest heart and tell you there has never been a day in my life that every word that came out of that man's mouth I didn't say yay and amen to and I'm not saying I had a proper understanding of it and that I understood the depths of it but I'm just telling you even as a grade school kid I went to school quoting the prophet and whatever he said was truth even when I didn't understand it so when somebody comes and they say I have a different opinion about what's something the brother brandom taught I can't go there I have no ability to go there and I'm not saying that there's like I'm not saying this brother is a bad brother I'm sure he's a good brother and I'm not saying that you're bad if you've ever had that I'm just saying the upbringing that I had I was raised listening to this voice as a kid I was born and raised in the message I heard the tapes I heard the voice and it just always rang true and even when I didn't live it it was still true it's not because that I had a better idea I did stuff wrong I made wrong decisions I needed a new birth I needed to be converted I need the demon of selfishness out of me I needed the demon of Pride out of me but it did not change the fact that I would always confess whatever he said was fact and true yay and amen even if it was his opinion I don't have a better opinion because when that man walks to the pull pit and says I've tapped into the back part of God's mind and my soul says yay and amen I don't have an opinion I may be a dumb hellbelly but I'm smarter than that if he's tapped into the back part of God's mind how in the world do I think I've got a better idea of what God might like what might be more pleasing or acceptable to God and this brother told me that and I said brother like what are you talking about he's like well like for interracial marriage and things like I just don't see that I don't agree with that and I said said well I don't like you'll have to pray about it you'll have to deal with it like if brother brandom tells me that the sky is green and the grass is blue then I say praise God the sky is green and the grass is blue and he says well God would never expect us to believe anything like that God would never expect you to believe something that your eyes told you was different right I said brother I'm sorry but I just can't relate to that I said if brother brandom says that the sky is green and the grass is blue it's super simple for me I've been collar blind my whole life there's not a problem here God's not asking me to believe anything that is wrong it's my eyes were have been wrong my entire life and now I've had my eyes properly interpreted to me I have no ability to interpret it to myself if he has interpreted something I have no opinion on it and even if he says I think in all reality that the sky is green and the grass is blue guess what my opinion is my eyes are not functioning properly because I'm still seeing greenish grass and bluish Skies God help me to have my vision adjusted to match your vision cuz this now look Saints I'm not talking if he says I like this belt buckle and I got to have it okay I don't even like belt buckles I don't feel that I have he liked this certain kind of pocket knife and now I he he liked this certain kind of gun I'm not talking fanaticism I'm talking a spiritual principles when a prophet comes on the scene who's tapped into the back part of God mind and he's laying spiritual principles to us and we confess that we believe he's tapped into the back part of his mind but we'll get hung up on something that he mentions his opinion on when we'll use one quote as an excuse to wear makeup what did he tell you go was pleasing to God was for you to be natural I would rather walk walk into church every Sunday and walk in public every day with pock marks all over my face looking like I'd run sandpaper all over me knowing that I was in the perfect will of God then I would have makeup on me knowing that I was presenting a false face and outside of the will of God the reason you got to wear makeup is only one reason it's Pride reason you wear tight clothes Pride selfishness you need to look a little bit better than somebody else these simple things that he's taught us these simple things that he's taught us it goes back to the same things pride and selfishness now look I know that's maybe some harsh statements but I want to follow that up with this I UND I'm not here preaching marriage and divorce and trying to clear all that up I know and I understand that there is people to ignorance of proper teaching beforehand and they're in situations that they maybe would not be in right now if they had been taught properly I am not doing away with grace for that if you didn't know better you didn't know better I'm I'm not saying that we need to go as brother R said and fix all this stuff we ain't got time to fix all this stuff if you did it knowingly you're going to have to fix it if it was done in ignorance there was Grace given for that and I'm not about to take that Grace away and I don't want to go too much farther on that because that's not my position I not the pastor here I'm just simply relaying a principle that there were things that brother brandham expressed his opinion about but there was Authority that came with that that we accept and I find it odd that we will accept that he tapped into the back part of God's mind and that he can express his opinions about everything else and we'll agree with it unless it's something that we don't really want or we don't really like or it's something we want to hold on to Let's Not Be double-faced he either tapped into the back part of God's mind and knew what was pleasing to God and expressed that to us or he didn't Psalms 4610 there's a reason this was over top of the pulpit at the brandham Tabernacle Psalms 46:10 says be still and know that I am God you will never truly have the full revelation of him being God if you can't first get rid of your own selfishness and your own pride and be still our culture today tells us talk talk talk talk talk everybody's got an opinion everybody's got something to say the scripture says opposite the scripture says Be Still quiet yourself know that I am God Matthew 1236 says but I say unto you that Every Idle Word that a man speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words shall thou be justified and by thy words shall they be condemned remember this whole pride and selfishness this testing to brother Brandon preluded the third pole coming into existence preluded the spoken word being released to him do you think that that would have ever moved forward if he hadn't first learned how to be still and know that he was God to know that God was God he has first got to come to that recognition that I as a minister I've got to be still there is gifts in my life there's things that I can do but I have got to be still first and know that he is God I'm going to skip to the end of this and then we're going to close I'm sorry to have kept you so long we'll be done in 10 minutes brother brandom is relaying the story of Hope dying he says friends if I live a hundred years I'll never forget what happened those two bring big brown eyes looked up at me she was so weak she couldn't say nothing she was smiling she took her finger and she motions and I got down and she said why did you call me honey and I said well I I don't know she said I was in another land and it was so peaceful I wasn't suffering she said great big birds like a great Orion she said there was a man dressed in white one on each side taking me home old friend there's a land somewhere I believe she was as she was dying her eyes just opened up to see Paradise Beyond she rallied for a little bit the nurse came in and she said nurse come over now remember we're talking about the demon a demon of selfishness but now we're talking about a dying woman on her deathbed who's already slipped into the sixth Dimension and been pulled back out and she's on her way back into the sixth Dimension Now watch how she conducts herself she said nurse come over she Saidi hope when you get married you'll have a husband like mine I said oh honey I haven't done nothing she said oh bless your heart she patted me on the back nurse turned around walked out crying she said bill I want I want to tell you a few things said I'm going said don't cry I said all right this is a dying woman this is a dying wife this is a dying mother she is not playing games she is not putting on she is not mincing her words don't let my babies be pulled from Pillar To Post that don't sound selfish to me this is a dying woman she's concerned about the well-being of her babies don't let my babies be pulled from Pillar To Post she said I've got some things to confess to you I saidwhat is it she said do you remember one time you were going fishing and I called you and that night you were going to Fort Wayne for a meeting I said yes said you went to get me some stockings I said yes I remember them she said them was the wrong kinds of stockings honey them wasn't right Billy I I gave them to your mother they was for an older woman than me this is a lady that went into the sixth Dimension and has been pulled back out and when she comes back out she realizes she's got some things to confess to her husband and it's about her Pride that she couldn't wear a pair of socks because she thought they were for an older woman than her you talk about a standard being readjusted Saints I think it's time that we do away with our standard the world's standard even the message standard and we take the standard that's going to be held when we get into that Dimension cuz you remember in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve were clothed and when they when God came Adam confessed I'm naked and he was clothed with fig leaves hope goes beyond the curtain of time thinking she's all right when she slips back out she realizes I've got something I've got to confess I still had a little pride laying in my heart that I was too young to wear them stockings you either get it or you don't get it Saints I don't I don't know but if we can wrap our mind around that I think it'll change our lives this is the appropriate standard and definition of selfishness and it didn't work in the sixth Dimension she had to come back out and make it right before she went back in she thought that she was too young to wear some older stockings for an older woman he said well God bless you honey I didn't know that that was all right she said you remember that time you wanted to go hunting so bad and we was at Louisville you seen that little 22 rifle as the musicians would come please and you wanted and it cost $300 something for you to pay down on it and it didn't and you didn't have the money to pay it it's it's been about 2 years ago I said yeah yeah I remember she says Bill I've always wanted to buy you that rifle she said I won't be with you for a few minutes longer now but when you go home look up on top of the old folding bed under that piece of paper and I've been saving nickels for you to buy to buy that rifle she said will you promise me you'll buy it a dying woman concerned about her babies concerned about confessing that she did something wrong out of Pride wanting her husband to take the money she earned washing and go buy a gun with it she says promise me promise me that you won't stay single sa she's giving up everything she was a wife and she was a mother now she's telling him go get another wife don't let my babies be dragged around Pillar To Post promise me that you won't stay single my children will have a home to go to and not be drug around everywhere she has slipped back out of this six sixth Dimension and she is dealing with any little small selfish High School demon that may be laying around giving up as being a wife giving up as being the mother to these children let somebody else mother them yeah I can't but let somebody else I can't be your wife anymore get some let somebody else help you and in closing she said and another thing she says you realize why I'm going don't you oh that's what hurt you realize why I'm going don't you she said if I wouldn't have listened to Mama it wouldn't have been it would have been different wouldn't it promise me you'll go right out into the fields where we were supposed to go I would venture to say the biggest heartache in brother bram's Life As We would stand together the biggest complex that he had the thing that hurt him the most when a dying woman on her deathbed came to it she said if I wouldn't have listened to mama she tried as a dine woman woman knowing that that was going to haunt him for the rest of his life she tried to take that burden off of him it was because I listened to mama not you it was me that listened to Mama and done wrong not you Saints we've been given an invitation if you'll play something please we've been given an invitation to come to communion to come to a wedding supper to come and examine our self by the word of God and by the appropriate standard I don't want to come to a point in my life that I start slipping [Music] dimensions and have to hit the brakes and say Lord will you let me go back just for a second I got to make something right forgive my emotion I'm not trying to work on your emotions this morning Saints the word has went forth the word is enough it either Pricks your heart or it don't but I tell you it pricked my heart it's pricked my heart for [Music] months and I don't want to come to that point to where I start slipping out and I start going into the presence of the true standard and realize I ain't Towing in the line that I'm not measuring up that I still got a little bit of Pride or a little demon of self andish laying around we have been given a full word with full Vindication and the reason that we've been given that is to do a full proper assessment of ourselves not so that we can be smarter than the religious world I say that we accept the invitation to the feast as we close our eyes and bow our heads I say we accept and our pastor would come I say we accept the invitation that's been given I'm so sorry that I've been lengthy it's just the way that it kind of played out I thank you for being attentive you've been very respectful and I'm just going to close on that because I don't really have anything else to say or to mention like I said the word has went forth it either hits your heart or it doesn't but I pray that it'll strike your heart the way that it struck mine and that we'll do away with all our pride and all of our envy and all of our stress and all of our selfishness and recognize them for the demons that they are and deal with them not with soft gloves but deal with them as demons ought to be dealt with I've said some hard things I've said some harsh things I pray your forgiveness I'm I'm not just saying this but I honestly pray your forgiveness if I've offended you if I've said anything too hard or or wrong God knows my heart I I did not mean to offend anybody and I I purposely tried to hold back from preaching to go slow so that I wouldn't get caught up and say anything too harsh ler in the wrong Spirit but I can't apologize for what I've said because I believe it to be the word of God and I believe the principle is to be true and they apply to me just as they apply to you but I want to ask sister an if she would just come and sing that song again as we would close sorry to put you on the spot like that sis but I just feel that it's appropriate and I would just [Music] Saints there a reason there's a reason that brother emanuel's preached this brother gab's preached this brother kyus preached this and our pastors alluded to it it's not so that we can miss something so that we can catch something and I'm it's all I know to do as a gospel minister is to tell you today that you've been given a wedding supper invitation to be still and to quiet yourself and let him speak to you and work on you I just would ask you to do that as our sister and song later would sing this here this morning God bless you working daily for your cause there's so little time to pause and and seek you [Music] prayerfully good intentions somehow fail empty promises Prevail oh my too

in Qui [Music] I amen amen I don't know about you but my seat got a little hot a few times and I'm thankful I'm grateful for it I'm so thankful that our brother will pour out his heart and say things that no human being wants to say in front of congregation of people but sometimes s we're blind to these little blind spots in our life that are hindering our spiritual growth and stopping us from moving forward we can't see them we don't know they're there but God will use the foolishness of preaching to open our eyes and say there's a hindrance in your life there's something that's stopping your progress through something that's not pleasing to the Lord I thank God for it I realize sitting in my seat that we too easily excuse what we call little things it's a little thing and the truth is on the surface it is a little thing somewhat insignificant doesn't make a big deal but it's not the surface that's the problem it's the root of that little thing is selfishness that's the big deal the big deal is not the little infraction or the little the big deal is the selfishness I sat in my seat and I marveled how my hindrance is me you realize brother bandam when he come to the seventh seal he he he began to tell us that God one plan one goal one thing he wanted to achieve and he unfolded it in three parts first to get preeminence in a man he did that in Christ Jesus he didn't have it fully in Moses he didn't have it fully in David he didn't have it fully in Jeremiah he never had it till he come to Jesus Christ and the second was to get preeminence in a body of Believers of people his bride and that's what he's doing now he didn't have it through all the church Church ages he didn't have it in his reading but he's going to have it now do you know what's hindering the program of God self selfishness Pride what is God need more than anything he needs me to get out of the way to stop defending protecting promoting to stop making excuses he just needs me to say Lord I'm sorry I'm not making excuses for little things anymore I don't want to be selfish anymore I don't want my self-love to hinder the work of God that's the nature of Lucifer that's injected to Mankind and we all fight it but I thank God that he's brought it to our attention and I say if God's picked your heart and he's opened your eyes in some way and said you know what that's me I've made excus exuses because of selfishness I've overlooked some things I shouldn't have overlooked because of what I wanted the way it made me feel that you I just encourage you just to repent it's that easy it's not far away just say God that was me when brother Ben was saying that and maybe he didn't even mention this application but you told me I know it applied here in my life and Lord forgive me remember brother bandam one time was talking to a woman she had a dream she was walking on White Sands she wanted brother brandham to interpret the dream and in the interpretation he says you drifted from God but you want to come back she said that's true he said you're back now not months from now not weeks from now not when you do pentant but when you want to come back when you want to line back up when you surrender and say that's me God I'm sorry if you realize my selfishness has been hindering you and you want to come back in line I want to tell you you can come back right now say God forgive me for my selfishness for my my my self focus my self- love which is all rooted in Pride forgive me so I just like to take a minute and pray together and if you want to pray at your seat or pray at the altar the altar is open if something praked your heart and you just want to say Lord I want to surrender that to you too dyam myself I'd encourage you to do so now let's just bow our heads together and pray their Heavenly Father God all I can say is I'm sorry Lord I'm so thankful father that you can still speak that you can take a vessel of clay that's human all you can take that vessel and you can push him to his limits beyond what he's comfortable with so that you can use that mouthpiece to speak something that I needed to hear Lord I'm not offended not angry Lord I'm thankful I'm thankful that you love me enough that I'm not going to continue on blindly plunging through walking over principles but God my desire is to surrender all to you to be pleasing to you Lord Jesus in this quiet time that we have right now would you search each of our hearts Lord would your spirit work in US Lord and begin to expose those things that are hindering us and tripping us those areas of self-love and self- focus and pride and selfishness that are stunting our our growth and keeping us Lord from the plan you have for us and God would you give us the courage to be honest about it to confess it Lord not to bristle or to complain but just to Simply melt under the exposing light of your word and may it melt away Lord everything that's not like you and may we just flatten ourselves and realize I'm not yet what I ought to be Lord we've you've brought us so far Lord You've corrected us and you've taught us you've encouraged us you've instructed us you've tore us down and you've built us up but Lord there's more things that need tore down and built back up Lord I'm thankful Lord I pray that you move in the hearts and lives of all of your children may we all Lord be honest right now with ourselves God and realizing that we've sometimes kept self at the center of our world we've overlooked things the prophet told us we've neglected things that we know we should do we've allowed things we know we shouldn't do and we know what the root of it Lord is selfishness God My Eyes Are Open it's not a little thing the outward may be minor but the trouble is deep inside my heart the selfishness that lays there that would be willing to ignore willing to quiet that voice willing to trample over the alarm bells in my heart just to please myself God that's the deeper issue that's the real problem that's what's hindering God I pray that you give us the courage to deal with that right now and surrender ourselves aresh to you forgive us Lord forgive us for our selflove and selfishness and pride Purge it from us Lord you didn't preach this message in vain you preached it because you want to take us to a higher place you preached it because you wanted to open our eyes to what was hindering us and holding us back God you didn't preach it to punish you didn't preach it to hinder you didn't preach it to chastise you preached it for growth you preached it for our benefit for our blessing God help us to receive it that way may you take us to higher ples than we've ever been maybe we be we be willing to pay the price now so that we don't have to pay a price later God I want to pay the price now help me God may your spirit strengthen me may your Holy Spirit correct me May it come in and pour the bomb of Gilead and heal that broken place in my heart as your word has broke me let your word mend me your word has revealed hidden places is in my heart of trouble may it come now Lord and pour the balm of Gilead in to heal and to restore and bring me up Lord to a higher Place may I have the fresh eyes sa to see aresh today you in a new light may I Surrender my life to you aresh that you can take me Lord and finish your purpose on this Earth with these bodies of Flesh we surrender ourselves to you God we ask that you would touch our brother Benjamin strengthen him pour your love into his heart for Lord I know he'll suffer mentally for what he said for sacrificing himself for the benefit of the body but I pray that you would you would stop all the fiery darts of the enemy you would bless our brother and pour your love into his heart may he have the satisfaction of knowing that he pleased you God help us as we move from here may we never be the same may we be awakened Lord to the trappings of the enemy to the influences of demons that would try Lord to hinder our spiritual growth Lord I love you I thank you Father for what you've done for us today for you're a good father and you're loving oh we love you we trust in you we put our hands in
