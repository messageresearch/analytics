========================================

the blind man that is healed this is a blind man from his birth he's healed and the only thing the scribes and the Pharisees can say is that's clearly not of God because he did it on the Sabbath and who is that guy anyhow were they really concerned about who he was and what he was doing or were they concerned about their position being threatened why were they asking the question who made you whole who healed your eyes how did he do it was it because they really wanted to know so that they could duplicate that or was it because they were concerned that you know what this guy's kind of got something we don't have and there is a lot of people interested in it right and we really need to put that new addition on the temple and we came up 20% short on the offerings this month because they were out with this guy what was their motivation what were they concerned about by asking their questions this the lame man that was healed same thing they couldn't even be happy for the poor guy right this is a man who hasn't walked in years and now he can walk and he can rejoice and and they can't even say praise the Lord we're happy for you who did this when did he do it he did it on the Sabbath he's clearly not of God he's a devil why would why did he have to be of the devil they hadn't even talked to him they hadn't even figured this out they haven't even say why did you do this why' you do there is no investigation but there's a verdict why because they needed that to be true you have Mary come with the alabaster box break it Judas says that's a waste we just lost all that money that we could have given to the poor we don't even have to wonder about the interpretation of this because it's written right in the scripture he said it because he was a thief at heart not that he cared anything about the poor there's two men possessed of devils Jesus casts them out and they go into a herd of swine run off a cliff there is no focus on the neighbor in the neighborhood about these two men who've been possessed of devils for year are now free clothed sitting in the right mind listening to a man talking about the gospel praise God let's have a party no the only concern is we ain't going to have no more bacon our pigs are gone our livelihood is threatened right pigs versus two sons of God right pigs livelihood livelihood is what those pigs were rubber meat in the road am you may not be a pig seller but how many times have we taken and chose our livelihood not being threatened over something that God's doing
