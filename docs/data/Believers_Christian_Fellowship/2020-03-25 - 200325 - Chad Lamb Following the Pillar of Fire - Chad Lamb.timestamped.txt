[8:21] so god bless you both
[8:23] amen
[8:24] let's go ahead and read our scripture
[8:26] john
[8:27] 16
[8:29] and verse 13.
[8:33] how be it when he the spirit of truth
[8:35] has come he will guide you into all
[8:37] truth for you shall not speak of himself
[8:39] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[8:41] i speak and he shall show you things to
[8:44] come
[8:45] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[8:47] of mine and shall show it unto you
[8:49] all things that the father hath are mine
[8:51] therefore said i that he shall make take
[8:54] of mine and shall show it unto you
[8:57] i mean let's just pray for the lord's
[8:58] blessing dear heavenly father we thank
[9:01] you for the reading of the word and for
[9:03] the privilege to be here lord
[9:05] god it's not passing us by what a
[9:07] special privilege this is by your grace
[9:10] and your mercy
[9:11] god we just take it seriously now and we
[9:14] thank you that we can be here to worship
[9:16] your name that we can gather together to
[9:18] sing your praises lord we pray now god
[9:21] that you would come in the way that
[9:23] you've promised lord that you would
[9:25] break the bread of life to us through
[9:26] the preaching of the word that we me we
[9:28] might feed from your hand as your sheep
[9:31] this evening we give you preeminence
[9:33] lord and pray that you would take
[9:34] control in jesus name we pray amen
[9:38] you can have your seats
[9:41] i just want to talk about
[9:44] a couple things here before we move on
[9:48] we've had
[9:49] um because of the
[9:51] the crisis that's going on we've had a
[9:52] few of the brothers in the church uh
[9:55] lose some work and and we may have more
[9:57] we may have more needs but there's a
[10:00] deacon's fund so if you feel impressed
[10:02] at all to give at this time to the
[10:04] deacon's fund you can do that on the
[10:06] tithe envelope under special needs just
[10:08] right deacons or deacons fun and the
[10:11] deacons will take care of that but i
[10:12] also want to let everybody know that
[10:14] that's there because if if you know of
[10:17] somebody that has lost a job or lost
[10:19] work even temporarily and then just you
[10:23] know you might want to check on them or
[10:24] you want to might want to pass that off
[10:25] to one of the deacons so the deacons can
[10:27] check on them because they may miss some
[10:29] people they may not catch what's going
[10:31] on all over but let's take care of one
[10:33] another let's watch out for one another
[10:35] and let's band ourselves together and
[10:38] and you know this is a this is a good
[10:40] time for us to draw up closer amen and
[10:43] take care of one another we don't know
[10:45] what the economic impact will be
[10:46] completely or how far reaching the
[10:48] economic impact will be it may be that
[10:51] the economic complications are are worse
[10:54] or take longer to recover from even than
[10:56] the virus so we don't know what will
[10:58] happen in the future but i had a
[11:00] conversation with my family and told
[11:02] them that we we're going to be a little
[11:04] more conservative and we're going to cut
[11:06] out what we can cut out and try to have
[11:08] no waste so that we have a little extra
[11:10] money in our hands in case we have a
[11:11] brother or sister who needs it and so i
[11:14] think as a body that's a good idea now
[11:16] would be a good idea to tighten the belt
[11:18] a little bit and cut off any surplus
[11:20] it's not like we can go out to eat so
[11:22] that should be a little extra money
[11:25] amen it's not like we're traveling for
[11:27] vacation right now so
[11:29] it's a good time just to put aside
[11:31] anything we can for needs that our
[11:33] brothers and sisters might have i
[11:35] believe god will bless his bride
[11:37] in the midst of trouble amen it may be
[11:40] difficult it may not be easy but i
[11:41] probably i believe he'll bless his bride
[11:44] and where one lacks i believe he'll give
[11:46] somebody else a surplus and if we just
[11:48] watch one another we can take care of
[11:50] one another so we just pray for that
[11:54] also i just wanted to mention that we've
[11:56] got you know more people spending more
[11:58] time at home
[11:59] than before
[12:01] and this is a blessing
[12:03] this is a blessing because
[12:05] we live in a in a fast-paced society in
[12:08] a world that keeps moving and won't ever
[12:09] stop no matter how bad we want it to
[12:11] stop
[12:12] and god has created circumstances maybe
[12:14] not everybody's in that situation now
[12:17] but some some certainly are in the
[12:19] situation where life just
[12:22] paused in some ways can't do everything
[12:25] that we were doing before and can't run
[12:27] to all the places we were running before
[12:28] and and if god has given us more time
[12:31] let's not waste it
[12:33] and i'd like to say for the families
[12:35] this would be a good time to rebuild the
[12:37] family altar
[12:39] because we get so busy in this life
[12:40] sometimes that family altar gets a
[12:43] little bit neglected amen and maybe we
[12:45] get a little bit busy and we don't spend
[12:47] as much time
[12:48] gathering as a family for prayer and for
[12:50] devotions or to listen to a tape or to
[12:53] listen to a uh
[12:55] archived message like we used to but now
[12:57] would be a great time amen to put those
[13:00] stones back together and get that family
[13:02] altar spruced up and back into shape and
[13:04] spend some time together around the word
[13:07] of god and god has god has given his
[13:09] bride what she needs
[13:11] and if we have more time that means we
[13:13] need it let's not waste it let's use it
[13:15] in preparation for what comes next
[13:18] also i'd like to suggest
[13:20] uh this past november uh
[13:24] brother abraham myra was here and he
[13:25] preached two messages that i'd like to
[13:28] suggest if you're at home and looking
[13:30] for something to do you can go back and
[13:32] watch these two services but in those
[13:34] two services he preached uh some things
[13:37] that i think we're seeing transpire
[13:39] right now he talked about the the ship
[13:41] you know that paul the apostle was on
[13:43] when he was a prisoner and and now the
[13:46] angel of the lord came to the apostle
[13:47] paul and told him that you're going to
[13:49] lose all the merchandise and you're
[13:50] going to lose the ship but not one soul
[13:52] will be lost
[13:53] and everything's going to fall apart and
[13:55] at the end of the journey you'll be
[13:56] swimming alone an individual walk with
[13:58] god
[13:59] either clinging to a board or swimming
[14:02] to land and he preached two parts on
[14:04] that and i'd recommend going back and
[14:06] listening to it i think if you listen to
[14:07] it now it'll be like
[14:09] wow
[14:10] he preached this in november
[14:13] so that would be a good thing to listen
[14:15] to but but yeah don't gather around and
[14:18] pray gather around this is a great time
[14:20] to talk to your children
[14:22] things are changing things that
[14:24] i've never seen in my lifetime most of
[14:26] us have never seen in our lives times
[14:28] but it's a great time to to to talk to
[14:31] our children and share with them what
[14:32] we're seeing and and the effect that
[14:34] it's having and the change in the world
[14:36] because they're just young children
[14:38] living at a time that things are are
[14:39] changing rapidly and fast and
[14:42] and appears to be the wrap-up of all
[14:44] things and and let's take our time with
[14:46] our children and explain these things to
[14:48] them and talk to them and pray with them
[14:50] and that everybody's equipped amen
[14:52] everybody is in place for whatever comes
[14:56] next
[14:57] so let's not waste these times i just
[14:58] want to encourage you many of you are
[15:00] already doing that but i want to
[15:01] encourage you just to just to focus that
[15:03] time that we have and and not waste it
[15:06] not squander it away
[15:08] this is a special time this is a special
[15:10] time to be alive
[15:12] i would say it's a privileged time to be
[15:14] alive
[15:16] and it may be that in the flesh we have
[15:19] to get more uncomfortable than we are
[15:20] now
[15:22] it it very well may be in fact i
[15:25] wouldn't say very well it will be more
[15:27] uncomfortable
[15:29] as far as the flesh goes the flesh is
[15:31] going to get more uncomfortable things
[15:33] may get a little more scratchy along the
[15:35] way and the press will get a tighter and
[15:38] tighter and tighter but praise god it's
[15:40] a privilege to be alive
[15:43] it's a privilege to be in this day to
[15:45] see the things transpire that prophets
[15:47] have longed to see that that all the
[15:50] church ages have longed for and here we
[15:52] stand in the time where these things are
[15:54] unfolding rapidly and it's a privilege
[15:56] to be alive but i want to be alert and
[15:59] attentive in this hour and i want to be
[16:01] spiritually minded not carnally minded
[16:03] so i can catch what god's doing
[16:06] i want to be i want to be in tune i want
[16:08] to be in the rhythm of the symphony as
[16:10] we listen to the message shalom i want
[16:12] to hear the changing of the beat do you
[16:14] hear the changing of the bee
[16:16] it's not hard right now your co-worker
[16:18] at work can hear the changing of the
[16:19] beam
[16:20] but i don't just mean the carnal things
[16:22] i mean spiritually are we catching that
[16:25] that god is moving his symphony along
[16:27] and i want to move with him i want to
[16:29] make the junction i don't want to be
[16:31] delayed and have to catch up i want to
[16:32] be when he moves i want to move
[16:35] this is a good time amen to to be
[16:37] sensitive and to be careful prayed up
[16:40] and meant in tune with what god's doing
[16:44] i'd like for us to turn to the book of
[16:46] exodus chapter three
[16:49] and i just want to spend a little time
[16:50] this evening in the word talking about
[16:53] following the pillar of fire
[16:56] and all of these things everything we're
[16:58] going to talk about are very familiar to
[17:00] us nothing new and but
[17:02] but it's just so refreshing for me to
[17:04] look at these things and and and take
[17:07] them in the hour that we live in and the
[17:09] circumstances that we're in and just go
[17:12] back over these things again to put our
[17:14] feet on solid ground
[17:16] because we're standing on solid ground
[17:19] the world is shifting sands but we're
[17:21] standing on solid ground
[17:23] in exodus chapter 3
[17:26] let's read from verse 1.
[17:29] now moses kept the flock of jethro his
[17:31] father-in-law the priest of midian and
[17:33] he led the flock to the backside of the
[17:35] desert and came to the mountain of god
[17:37] even to horeb
[17:38] and the angel the lord appeared unto him
[17:40] in a flame of fire out of the midst of a
[17:42] bush and he looked and behold the bush
[17:44] burned with fire and the bush was not
[17:46] consumed
[17:48] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[17:50] see this great sight
[17:52] why the bush is not burnt
[17:54] and when the lord saw that he turned
[17:56] aside to sea god called unto him out of
[17:58] the midst of the bush and said moses
[18:01] moses and he said here am i and he said
[18:04] draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes
[18:06] from off thy feet for the place wherein
[18:08] thou stand this is holy ground
[18:10] moreover he said i am the god of thy
[18:12] father the god of abraham the god of
[18:14] isaac and the god of jacob and moses hit
[18:17] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[18:19] god
[18:20] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[18:23] affliction of my people which are in
[18:24] egypt and have heard their cry by reason
[18:27] of their taskmaster for i know their
[18:29] sorrows
[18:30] so he starts off by getting moses
[18:33] attention in the pillar of fire and
[18:35] moses is going to receive some
[18:37] instructions in this contact
[18:39] his contact with the pillar of fire
[18:41] which we know is the angel of the lord
[18:42] which we know is god and when moses when
[18:45] god begins to speak to moses and he
[18:47] knows who it is is speaking he hid his
[18:49] face for he feared to look at god
[18:51] because when we come in contact with the
[18:53] pillar of fire it should bring us into
[18:55] humility
[18:57] it should humble us it should break us
[18:59] down and in the the right approach is
[19:01] through humility
[19:03] remember when when isaiah when he saw
[19:06] the cherubim and the seraphim and the
[19:09] temple in worship he saw with two wings
[19:11] they covered their face and two wings
[19:13] they covered their feet and with two
[19:14] they were flying he said they were they
[19:16] were
[19:17] they recovered their feet in humility
[19:19] amen they covered their face in
[19:21] reverence and with two wings they were
[19:23] in action and he said this is the way to
[19:25] serve god in reverence in humility and
[19:28] in action
[19:30] not just in an action but in reverence
[19:32] and humility and in action and god had
[19:36] made sure that moses was in the right
[19:38] place because moses wasn't reverent and
[19:41] humble to begin with because moses was
[19:43] raised up in egypt with the best
[19:45] training military training and education
[19:48] and the finest of everything and he had
[19:50] in himself the idea
[19:52] that he could be a deliverer
[19:54] he was told he was a deliverer and he
[19:56] was it was truth it was nothing but the
[19:58] truth he was called to be a deliverer he
[20:00] was born a proper child and then he was
[20:02] born under a sign born to be the
[20:04] deliverer but all his earthly training
[20:07] amen got him a false confidence and he
[20:11] went into action without the leadership
[20:13] of the pillar of fire it wasn't the
[20:14] leadership of god but it was by his own
[20:17] desire in his own mind to deliver his
[20:19] people and he failed
[20:22] and he ran afraid afraid for his life
[20:25] and he ran into the wilderness amen and
[20:27] he went from a military man he went from
[20:29] a prince in egypt and he became a man
[20:32] who kept the flock of jethro his
[20:34] father-in-law in the backside of the
[20:36] desert by himself with a little family
[20:40] out out away from the fineries of egypt
[20:43] and there for 40 years brother bam said
[20:46] god had to beat moses out of moses
[20:49] and get him to the place where god would
[20:51] call to him when he would come and he
[20:53] would declare who he is he would hide
[20:55] his face for he feared to look at god he
[20:58] had been humbled
[21:00] i say praise god help us lord to
[21:02] approach you humbly
[21:04] if you're going to do something mighty
[21:06] in our lives in this age and we believe
[21:07] this is the age for a mighty
[21:09] demonstration of power amen it must come
[21:11] through humble vessels who are reverent
[21:14] to god
[21:15] and reverent to his word
[21:17] so he must be reverent humble and in
[21:20] action
[21:22] so he got moses into this place and
[21:24] and then he says in verse 7 he said i
[21:26] have surely seen the affliction of my
[21:28] people
[21:29] which are in egypt and have heard their
[21:31] cry by reason of their taskmaster for i
[21:33] i know their sorrows
[21:35] god is declaring i know exactly what
[21:38] they're going through
[21:40] now you probably would have a hard time
[21:43] convincing those that were in egypt at
[21:45] the time this is being said when they
[21:47] were when they were under the task
[21:49] master when they were cruelly treated
[21:51] and they were in bondage amen they were
[21:53] probably having a hard time amen
[21:55] believing that god was looking on their
[21:57] sorrows and heard their cry
[22:00] but he declares to moses that he he says
[22:03] i have surely seen the affliction of my
[22:07] people who were they they were his
[22:09] people when were they ever not his
[22:11] people they were always his people they
[22:13] were his people because they were the
[22:15] children of abraham amen and he said i
[22:17] have seen my people i've seen the
[22:19] affliction of my people
[22:23] which are in egypt and i have heard
[22:25] their cry
[22:26] by reason of their task masters
[22:29] so for all those years they wondered
[22:31] where god was god was watching and god
[22:33] was hearing
[22:35] and for seven church ages god has been
[22:37] watching and god has been hearing
[22:40] he hasn't missed the one remember the
[22:43] prayers of the saints amen have been
[22:45] saved up in vials to be poured out of
[22:47] the end time amen because there was a
[22:49] time for deliverance and there was a
[22:51] promise for deliverance and there was a
[22:53] way that deliverance was going to come
[22:55] amen and god was taking all of those
[22:57] prayers of the saints in the new
[22:59] testament and when you get to the book
[23:00] of revelation the poor the the prayers
[23:03] of the saints were poured out before god
[23:05] when the lamb took the book because now
[23:07] it's time for deliverance this is the
[23:09] way of deliverance and god didn't lose
[23:11] one of those prayers he heard them all
[23:13] he knew the affliction he knew what was
[23:15] happening in the bondage of catholicism
[23:20] amen god knows where we're at
[23:24] he knows all about it
[23:29] verse 8
[23:32] and that i am come down to deliver them
[23:35] out of the hand of the egyptians
[23:38] that i have come down
[23:40] personally
[23:42] i have come down to deliver them
[23:45] personally
[23:47] when god's going to bring a deliverance
[23:49] he's going to come down personally
[23:52] what do you think that cloud was that
[23:54] appeared in azera arizona in the skies
[23:57] amen in february 28th in 1963 that was
[24:01] him coming down personally
[24:04] they didn't see in this day of god
[24:06] coming down amen in his own human flesh
[24:09] amen he was coming down and working
[24:11] through moses the prophet
[24:13] but it was he himself that was coming
[24:15] down
[24:16] i am come down to deliver them out of
[24:18] the hand of the egyptians and to bring
[24:20] them up out of that land into a good
[24:22] land and a large into a land flowing
[24:25] with milk and honey unto the place of
[24:27] the canaanites and the hittites and the
[24:28] amorites and the and the perizzites and
[24:31] the hivites and the jebusites now
[24:33] therefore behold the cry of the children
[24:35] of israel has come unto me and i've also
[24:37] seen the oppression where with the
[24:39] egyptians oppressed them come now
[24:41] therefore and i will send thee unto
[24:42] pharaoh
[24:44] that thou mayest bring forth my people
[24:46] the children of israel out of egypt
[24:50] praise god god always comes in such a
[24:52] humble way
[24:54] that pharaoh didn't know it was god
[24:56] coming down to deliver him
[24:58] he saw an 80 year old man with a stick
[25:00] in his hand who wasn't even eloquent of
[25:03] speech by this point and he would have
[25:05] his i mean he would whisper to his
[25:06] brother then his brother would speak for
[25:08] him
[25:10] and he was saying let my people go as
[25:12] god has said let my people go and
[25:14] pharaoh saw these two old men because
[25:16] aaron was older than than moses and he
[25:19] saw these two old men and he saw the
[25:21] foolishness of this of this of this
[25:23] deliverance and he didn't know that it
[25:25] was god himself come down to deliver
[25:27] them all he saw was humble people all he
[25:30] saw was people who had been on the you
[25:32] know moses the backside endeavored in
[25:34] the desert and come into humility to the
[25:36] place where he wasn't even willing to
[25:37] speak for himself amen when he saw that
[25:40] brokenness and he saw that humbleness
[25:42] and then he saw the way pharaoh just
[25:44] laughed at him
[25:46] but he didn't know that it was god
[25:48] hiding behind this skin and that god was
[25:51] going to bring bring his people out by a
[25:53] mighty hand and god wanted to do it this
[25:55] way so that he could absolutely destroy
[25:58] the works of pharaoh
[26:00] [Music]
[26:02] praise god
[26:07] let's turn over to exodus chapter 5.
[26:11] so
[26:12] so
[26:13] moses comes down
[26:16] meets the pillar of fire gets the
[26:17] commandments so now he's following the
[26:19] leadership of the pillar of fire the
[26:21] leadership of god and he comes down in
[26:23] chapter five we'll go to verse 19. and
[26:26] he makes he he steps in and he and he
[26:29] speaks to pharaoh and he says let my
[26:30] people go and and pharaoh doesn't like
[26:33] this so he says you know the people are
[26:35] lazy they're listening to moses and air
[26:38] and they want to go worship and he says
[26:40] you know uh uh take away their straw
[26:42] make them find their own straw in their
[26:44] own stubble we're going to make it
[26:45] harder for them but the but the
[26:47] allotment of bricks each day cannot
[26:49] diminish one brick so everything gets
[26:51] more difficult and they they take the
[26:53] rulers of israel that they had set over
[26:55] israel and the task masters begin to
[26:57] beat them because they can't keep up and
[26:59] those and those rulers they go and
[27:01] approach the pharaoh and say pharaoh you
[27:03] know this isn't fair we can't meet the
[27:06] quota and he says you've been lazy
[27:08] because you've been listening to moses
[27:09] and want to go worship you go do it
[27:11] again
[27:12] and so everything's working just right
[27:14] on time but it's all a big mess
[27:18] everything's just a big mess moses heard
[27:20] from god
[27:22] moses met a pillar of fire the angel of
[27:24] the lord amen he heard from god and god
[27:27] told him to go down and deliver them
[27:29] amen this should have been a piece of
[27:31] cake
[27:32] with such a mighty sign with such a
[27:35] mighty word he should have went down and
[27:37] it should have went smooth amen but it
[27:39] didn't go so smooth
[27:42] and so moses
[27:44] he runs into the officers of the
[27:46] children of israel in verse 19
[27:48] chapter 5 verse 19 and the officers of
[27:51] the children of israel did see that they
[27:52] were in
[27:54] an evil case after it was said you shall
[27:57] not diminish ought from your bricks
[27:59] or of your daily task
[28:01] and they met moses and aaron who stood
[28:03] in the way as they came forth from
[28:06] pharaoh and they said unto them the lord
[28:08] look upon you in judge because you have
[28:10] made our our savior to be a board in the
[28:13] eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his
[28:15] servants to put a sword in their hand to
[28:17] slay us
[28:19] and moses returned unto the lord and
[28:20] said lord wherefore hast thou sow evil
[28:23] and treated this people why is it that
[28:25] thou has sent me
[28:28] he begins to question because god met
[28:31] him and told him what to do and god even
[28:33] told him that pharaoh won't listen to
[28:35] you
[28:37] but when but when the people that he
[28:39] came to deliver begin to judge moses and
[28:41] question moses and he's seen the
[28:43] hardship and he's seen everything going
[28:45] the wrong way he begins to question god
[28:47] again
[28:49] the very god of heaven who told him he
[28:51] starts in human reasoning he starts to
[28:53] question god again he said why has thou
[28:56] so evilly entreated this people god why
[28:59] why when i did what you said to do why
[29:01] did it get worse
[29:04] why when i obeyed your commandment i had
[29:06] a i mean we had a mighty experience do
[29:09] you understand what the experience at
[29:10] the burning bush must have been like a
[29:13] mighty experience that would move moses
[29:15] out and moses was going out to be the
[29:17] deliverer and he says you'll bring my
[29:19] people out of egypt and you'll bring
[29:21] them to this mountain to worship amen
[29:23] that was a mighty prophecy but when he
[29:25] goes in the fulfillment of the prophecy
[29:27] in obedience to the pillar of fire
[29:29] leadership amen it goes the wrong
[29:31] direction
[29:33] and that's a common thing in life
[29:35] friends when you begin to follow god at
[29:37] the leadership of the holy ghost in your
[29:39] life and you're sure that you're doing
[29:40] what god led you to do you can rest
[29:43] assured there's going to come tests
[29:44] because god is going to test our faith
[29:48] amen don't just expect everything to
[29:50] part and move out of your way because
[29:52] god told me and god led me to do if god
[29:54] led you to do then god is going to ask
[29:56] you to have faith in what he told you to
[29:59] do personally
[30:01] and you're going to have to face
[30:02] opposition and it very well may go the
[30:04] opposite direction of what you expected
[30:07] when you walk down but rest assure god
[30:10] is just setting the circumstances up for
[30:12] his glory
[30:14] [Applause]
[30:15] moses goes to ask the question these are
[30:17] good things to remind ourselves of we
[30:19] know these things we know them forward
[30:21] and backward but friends we're starting
[30:23] to live it
[30:24] [Applause]
[30:26] we've seen it happen through our lives
[30:28] but we're going to see it happen more
[30:30] and more and more we are going to have
[30:32] to stand on the leadership of the pillar
[30:34] of fire and not flinch
[30:36] in the face of all obstacles in the face
[30:39] of all opposition and pieces falling and
[30:41] the everything falling apart and chaos
[30:43] breaking out and you say god i thought
[30:45] you told me hey just because everything
[30:48] goes contrary doesn't mean he didn't
[30:50] tell you
[30:50] [Applause]
[30:54] praise god
[30:56] amen this is the way we're going to live
[30:59] this is the way we're going to overcome
[31:02] why hast thou so evenly entreated this
[31:05] people
[31:06] why is it that thou has sent me
[31:09] he starts to even question what god told
[31:12] him
[31:14] he starts to even question his
[31:15] commission he starts to question his
[31:18] holy ghost leadership
[31:20] have you ever been there
[31:23] where you're sure god's leading you to
[31:25] do something you go to do it amen and
[31:28] even the people you try to help amen
[31:30] they get mad at you
[31:34] does that ever happen
[31:36] misunderstand what you're saying get
[31:38] angry at you i'll blame you because it
[31:40] didn't work out well
[31:43] and then you begin to question even your
[31:45] commission
[31:46] why has thou sent me verse 23 for since
[31:49] i came to pharaoh to speak to in thy
[31:52] name he hath done evil to this people
[31:55] neither hast thou delivered the people
[31:56] at all
[31:59] god it didn't work
[32:02] it didn't work you told me
[32:05] i mean
[32:07] moses may start questioning himself did
[32:10] i really see a pill or fire i mean would
[32:12] i did i really take off and he's got to
[32:14] go back through the experience
[32:16] how can we say things like that because
[32:18] every one of us has been here
[32:20] you've got to go back through and say no
[32:23] it was god i mean it was god i know it
[32:25] was god i know that experience was real
[32:28] i know it was true
[32:32] he says why hast thou sent me for when i
[32:34] spoke to pharaoh what you told me he
[32:37] evenly treated the people and thou
[32:38] hasn't delivered them lord
[32:42] did you really think it was going to be
[32:44] easy
[32:47] praise be to god chapter 6 verse 1
[32:50] then the lord said unto moses
[32:52] now shalt thou see what i will do to
[32:54] pharaoh. for with a strong hand shall he
[32:57] let them go and with a strong hand shall
[32:59] he drive them out of his land
[33:02] god didn't want it to be easy
[33:06] god didn't want it to be a little show
[33:09] of his power god didn't want it to be
[33:12] just a a light thing but god wanted to
[33:15] show himself mighty and he wanted to
[33:17] show himself a god of all the earth of
[33:20] heaven and earth and god
[33:22] he got all of this is in his control he
[33:25] didn't want pharaoh to let him go the
[33:27] first time in fact if you read through
[33:29] this he hardens his heart and hardens
[33:31] his heart and hardens his heart and
[33:33] pharaoh gets to the place where pharaoh
[33:35] says i will now let them go but god
[33:37] hardens his heart
[33:39] because god doesn't want it to come easy
[33:42] because god wants to show how powerful
[33:44] and how mighty he is and he wants to
[33:46] utterly destroy egypt
[33:48] [Music]
[33:51] sometimes when things are going wrong
[33:54] and they keep going wrong
[33:57] god is setting a trap for the devil the
[33:59] devil's not setting a trap for you
[34:04] we got to have confidence in the
[34:06] leadership of god
[34:08] when we're following by the leadership
[34:10] of the holy ghost following the word of
[34:12] god amen as god gave it to us through a
[34:14] prophet amen and we're following after
[34:16] what what brother branham has brought us
[34:18] what god has showed us to be true and
[34:20] we're following that in faith amen and
[34:22] things go wrong god is setting up
[34:25] something to show his power he's setting
[34:28] up the circumstances to show his glory
[34:30] amen is nothing is going wrong
[34:35] but we can start questioning
[34:37] lord why did you even send me lord you
[34:40] didn't say the brother said if i do this
[34:42] this will happen
[34:46] your word says if i do this this will
[34:48] happen yeah it's true but he never said
[34:50] what will happen in between
[34:53] if you do this this will happen
[34:56] yes absolutely 100 true that's the word
[35:00] but all the things that happen in
[35:01] between god's in control of that too
[35:04] it will come to pass they were leaving
[35:07] egypt under a mighty hand they were
[35:09] coming back to horup to worship at that
[35:11] mountain but everything that happened in
[35:12] between god had control of that too amen
[35:15] and god's told us something we can hold
[35:18] fast to that it'll come to pass but
[35:20] there may be a lot of things in between
[35:22] that he hasn't told us yet
[35:25] but that doesn't change his word and
[35:28] that doesn't change the leadership of
[35:29] god
[35:33] praise the lord
[35:35] let's go to exodus 13.
[35:38] we'll skip all the plagues
[35:40] all the things that happen
[35:42] now he lets them go
[35:48] egypt is destroyed
[35:51] because god wanted to destroy them
[35:57] for ten plagues
[35:59] he hardened pharaoh's heart
[36:01] so that he can keep destroying egypt
[36:04] and keep destroying egypt and keep
[36:06] destroying egypt because god wanted to
[36:08] destroy egypt
[36:11] so every time moses would do what god
[36:14] told him to do a plague would break out
[36:17] and
[36:18] no doubt
[36:19] the children of israel when they see the
[36:21] plague they say definitely this time
[36:25] definitely after this we're going to get
[36:27] to go
[36:29] and go with heart and pharaoh's heart he
[36:30] wouldn't let them go
[36:32] and then something else would happen and
[36:34] you can just imagine just put yourself
[36:36] there you've been under bondage under
[36:38] the taskmaster and now all of a sudden
[36:40] supernatural things are happening like
[36:42] you've never seen before in your
[36:44] lifetime and you're seeing egypt brought
[36:46] to its knees you're seeing the whole
[36:48] world system change and you think surely
[36:51] this time amen this time everything will
[36:54] change and it didn't change
[36:57] because there's another one coming
[37:00] and another one coming and another one
[37:02] coming because god wants to destroy
[37:05] egypt
[37:07] he doesn't want to give him a little
[37:08] whipping
[37:09] he wants to destroy them
[37:12] so
[37:13] it never goes like we expect it to go
[37:18] i think if we've served god any amount
[37:20] of time we can come to that conclusion
[37:22] it has never gone the way we expected it
[37:24] to go
[37:26] but god has never failed to keep his
[37:27] word
[37:30] in chapter 13
[37:33] we'll go to verse 20.
[37:35] they're leaving egypt now
[37:37] they've spoiled them
[37:39] now verse 20 says and they took their
[37:41] journey from sukkoth and encamped and
[37:44] eat them in the edge of the wilderness
[37:47] and the lord went before them by day in
[37:50] a pillar of cloud and led them
[37:52] and led them the way and by night in the
[37:54] pillar of fire to give them light to go
[37:56] by day and night
[37:58] he took not away the pillar of the cloud
[38:00] by day nor the pillar of fire by night
[38:02] from before the people
[38:04] so now they go out under direct
[38:07] leadership
[38:09] direct leadership of the pillar of fire
[38:12] direct leadership of the pillar of fire
[38:14] can't go wrong
[38:16] is that right
[38:19] but it can look like it goes wrong
[38:23] let's go to chapter 14
[38:26] verse 10.
[38:30] and when pharaoh drew nigh the children
[38:31] of israel lifted up their eyes and
[38:33] behold the egyptians marched after them
[38:36] and they were sore afraid and the
[38:38] children of israel cried out unto the
[38:39] lord and they said unto moses because
[38:41] there was no graves in egypt has thou
[38:44] taken us away to die in the wilderness
[38:48] listen friends
[38:49] they just saw some of the most
[38:51] supernatural things they've ever seen in
[38:53] their life they've seen some of the most
[38:54] supernatural things that have ever taken
[38:56] place on the face of the earth
[38:58] from that time to this time
[39:01] they've seen a sequence of events that
[39:02] some of the most supernatural happenings
[39:04] that have ever happened amen and here
[39:07] they are just a short time days maybe
[39:11] a couple of days later now they get into
[39:13] another obstacle and they go out singing
[39:16] and dancing spoiling their neighbors
[39:18] borrowing gold borrowing jewels barring
[39:21] raymond loading up their beasts taking
[39:23] everything out as a mighty victorious
[39:25] army in a battle they did not fight
[39:29] god did it all they didn't have to do
[39:31] anything god sent the prophet amen god
[39:34] sent moses along to do it all they had
[39:36] nothing to do with it all they had to do
[39:38] is sit and wait for their deliverance
[39:42] you remember they weren't even required
[39:43] to believe in it
[39:48] it didn't matter how much they doubted
[39:50] god said he was going to do it and god
[39:52] did it
[39:53] they could have been doubting all along
[39:54] but god gave his word and god was going
[39:57] to do it and they it wasn't their mighty
[39:59] faith that got them out it was the word
[40:01] of god
[40:04] and led them out a mighty army and here
[40:06] they are just a couple days later no
[40:08] doubt rejoicing in the camp we're free
[40:11] we're happy people we've got gold we've
[40:13] got jewels we've got raymond and they
[40:15] were told to take the raiment and put it
[40:17] on their sons and their daughters
[40:18] everybody leaves rich
[40:23] but now
[40:24] they turn and look and pharaoh and his
[40:26] armies coming
[40:29] and like that
[40:30] they forgot what god had just done
[40:39] they were still carnal
[40:42] earthly believers
[40:45] all they could see
[40:47] is what they could see
[40:49] and all they could know is what they
[40:52] could know
[40:56] and they said
[40:59] let's read this verse 10 again when
[41:01] pharaoh june 9 the children of israel
[41:03] lifted up their eyes and behold the
[41:04] egyptians marched after them and they
[41:06] were sore afraid and the children of
[41:07] israel cried on to the lord and they
[41:09] said unto moses because there was no
[41:11] graves in egypt has thou taken us away
[41:13] to die in the wilderness god didn't take
[41:16] him to die in the wilderness that was
[41:18] not the promise that was not the
[41:20] prophecy they had already lost faith in
[41:23] the word of god
[41:24] because of the circumstances because it
[41:27] was impossible because they were up
[41:29] against a mountain on one side amen they
[41:31] were they were wedged in by mountains
[41:33] amen and they were wedged against the
[41:35] sea and the only route of escape was the
[41:37] place that the egyptians were coming
[41:38] right down and because with their
[41:40] natural eyes they could see no way of
[41:42] escape they begin to throw away the word
[41:44] of god
[41:48] how quickly human beings follow the same
[41:50] path
[41:58] therefore has thou dealt thus with us to
[42:01] carry us forth out of egypt is not just
[42:03] the word that we did tell thee in egypt
[42:05] saying let us alone that we may serve
[42:07] the egyptians
[42:09] for it had been better for us to serve
[42:11] the egyptians than that we should die in
[42:13] the wilderness
[42:15] now
[42:17] listen when god come to moses he says i
[42:19] have heard the cry of my people by
[42:21] reason of their tax masters and i have
[42:23] seen their affliction
[42:25] they were crying for deliverance
[42:28] and god gave them deliverance
[42:30] and when it looked like that they would
[42:32] die in the wilderness they said no it
[42:34] was better for us to be bondage it was
[42:36] better for us to be in egypt but yet
[42:39] they were the ones crying for god to
[42:40] deliver them they had forgot their own
[42:43] prayer
[42:44] they had forgot their own request this
[42:47] is god gave them exactly what they were
[42:49] praying for and when god led them to the
[42:51] wilderness amen again and exactly
[42:54] exactly fulfilling what he had promised
[42:57] that to the t and their request he had
[42:59] come down and delivered them because
[43:01] they were crying for deliverance now
[43:03] they threw away their prayer now they
[43:05] threw away the prophecy to save their
[43:08] natural lives
[43:10] and fear of losing their natural lives
[43:13] friends i would have rather died right
[43:14] there by the seaside a free man than to
[43:16] go back into egypt
[43:18] i'd have rather known that god delivered
[43:20] me according to my prayer and according
[43:22] to his word and died right there like a
[43:24] man facing all of pharaoh and all of his
[43:26] armies than to say it was better for me
[43:28] to be back in the denominational systems
[43:31] i'd rather die believing this message
[43:33] i'd rather die standing with the prophet
[43:35] than to go back into the system to go
[43:38] back to be a common believer to believe
[43:40] in just common theology and have no
[43:42] faith in amen and waver every time
[43:45] circumstances change i'd rather die
[43:47] facing down the devil than to go back to
[43:50] where we came from
[43:52] they they were willing to go backwards
[43:55] to spare their natural life let me lose
[43:57] my natural life to keep marching forward
[43:59] because i can't die
[44:02] the sixth dimension is waiting for me if
[44:04] i go before the translation of the body
[44:08] but don't ever let me say it was better
[44:10] if this never had happened to me
[44:12] it doesn't matter how bad the
[44:14] circumstance is getting and they're
[44:15] going to get worse
[44:18] but let us take our place in the army of
[44:20] the lord and not throw away our very
[44:22] prayer requests and the prayer requests
[44:24] and the prayers of the church ages down
[44:26] to seven church ages that are stored up
[44:28] in vials that have been poured out when
[44:30] the lamb took the book let's not stomp
[44:32] on that to try to save a natural life
[44:35] or to make things easier for ourselves
[44:38] but let's face it as it is amen troubles
[44:41] are coming trouble's worse than what we
[44:43] have now persecution is coming this we
[44:46] haven't even seen persecution yet
[44:49] all we've seen a tightening up of the
[44:50] system maybe a little financial pressure
[44:53] and maybe a little a government pressure
[44:55] on us naturally but nothing spiritually
[44:58] yet
[44:59] no persecution yet
[45:04] we might as well face it now
[45:06] [Applause]
[45:08] amen
[45:12] praise god
[45:14] i'd rather stand on the promises of god
[45:17] and if i lose my natural life so be it
[45:20] but i want to die a believer
[45:23] in the deliverance of god holding the
[45:25] title deed in my hand
[45:29] praise be to god
[45:34] praise god
[45:36] verse 13
[45:39] and moses said unto the people fear ye
[45:41] not
[45:43] what was their problem
[45:45] they were afraid
[45:49] fear has such a power on human beings
[45:54] fear hath
[45:55] torment
[45:57] and the things that were coming out of
[45:59] their mouth was shocking
[46:01] because they were afraid
[46:04] because they were afraid they would have
[46:05] rather been back in the system serving
[46:07] the task masters because they were
[46:09] afraid because they were afraid they
[46:11] regretted their prayers being answered
[46:13] they regretted the prophet coming and
[46:15] they regretted being delivered because
[46:18] of the pressure
[46:20] because of the fear
[46:23] you see what fear will do to us if we
[46:25] let it override us
[46:29] jesus said to his disciples let not your
[46:32] heart be troubled
[46:34] when he said that he's telling them
[46:37] don't let your heart be troubled
[46:40] there's a praise place prepared for you
[46:43] you're just fine
[46:45] don't let your heart get away from you
[46:47] don't let fear overtake you resist it in
[46:50] the name of jesus christ stand against
[46:52] it don't let fear come in don't submit
[46:55] to it don't dwell on it don't give it a
[46:57] place in your mind but you arrest it and
[46:59] you bring it captive and you toss it out
[47:01] because once you go give yourself over
[47:03] to fear you'll be shocked at the things
[47:05] that come out of your mind and mouth and
[47:06] the unbelief that will spew out
[47:11] just because we're afraid of something
[47:13] happening or afraid of the circumstances
[47:15] that are around us afraid that it might
[47:17] get to us and we'll start spewing
[47:19] unbelief unbelief unbelief unbelief
[47:21] because of fear and we're gonna forget
[47:23] the very promise that is written in this
[47:25] book that we base our whole salvation
[47:27] and life on because of fear
[47:31] we've got to guard against it
[47:34] and moses said unto the people fear you
[47:35] not stand still and see the salvation of
[47:38] the lord
[47:39] fear not stand still
[47:41] when you've done all to stand stand
[47:44] with the whole armor on stand
[47:47] because there's nothing you can do about
[47:49] it anyways but you might as well stand
[47:51] on the word and let the one who can
[47:52] change all circumstances change all
[47:54] circumstances when the one who can
[47:56] deliver when it's impossible to be
[47:58] delivered he's done it before won't he
[48:00] do it again
[48:02] he's done it for us he's done it for us
[48:04] over and over again we've heard the
[48:05] testimonies we've shared testimonies
[48:07] with one another won't he do it again
[48:09] [Applause]
[48:11] amen all of those testimonies we have is
[48:14] just to bring us into a higher place in
[48:16] faith in a higher place in faith in a
[48:18] higher amendment it's not so that we can
[48:20] save a testimony it's not a merit badge
[48:22] that we earn in boy scouts amen it's
[48:25] trying and testing and overcoming so
[48:27] that we can stand amen we can stand the
[48:29] worst of the worst of the worst
[48:32] and what's going on in our world right
[48:34] now what's going on all around us amen
[48:36] is another test for us to overcome so
[48:39] that we can stand a little higher for
[48:41] what comes next
[48:48] said unto the people fear ye not stand
[48:51] still see the salvation of the lord
[48:54] which he will show to you today
[48:56] for the egyptians whom you have seen
[48:58] today you shall see them again
[49:01] no more forever
[49:06] they wanted to go back to bondage
[49:09] at the point of their
[49:14] deliverance at the point that they will
[49:17] be delivered from the egyptians forever
[49:21] the pressure got so intense at that
[49:24] moment the moment of deliverance that
[49:27] they feared and they were willing to
[49:29] throw it all away to go back to the
[49:32] taskmasters
[49:34] what do you think it's going to be like
[49:35] in this hour of deliverance
[49:40] probably not going to be a sunday school
[49:41] picnic
[49:48] the egyptians who you have seen today
[49:50] you shall see them again no more forever
[49:52] the lord shall fight for you and you
[49:54] shall hold your peace and the lord said
[49:56] unto moses wherefore christ down to me
[49:59] speak unto the children of israel that
[50:01] they go forward but lift thou up thy rod
[50:04] and stretch out thy hand over the sea
[50:06] and divide it and the children of israel
[50:08] shall go on dry ground through the midst
[50:10] of the sea
[50:12] let's go to psalm 77 keep your place in
[50:15] exodus we're coming back but just go
[50:16] over to the book of psalm
[50:19] 77.
[50:30] psalm 77 14
[50:33] the psalmist speaking of deliverance out
[50:35] of egypt
[50:37] verse 14 thou art the god that does
[50:39] wonders thou has declared thy strength
[50:41] among the people thou hast with thine
[50:44] arm redeemed thy people the sons of
[50:46] jacob and joseph sila
[50:48] and the water saw thee oh god the water
[50:50] saw thee they were afraid the depths
[50:52] also were troubled the clouds poured out
[50:54] water the sky sent out a sound thine
[50:57] arrows also went abroad
[50:59] the voice of thy thunder was in the
[51:01] heaven the lightnings lighted the world
[51:02] the earth trembled and shook
[51:05] thy way is in the sea and thy path in
[51:07] the great waters and thy footsteps are
[51:09] not known
[51:11] thou led us thy people like a flock by
[51:13] the hand of moses and aaron
[51:16] let's go back to exodus
[51:20] he's saying
[51:21] thy ways are in the water
[51:23] thy path is not known
[51:27] you see
[51:28] god
[51:29] made no mistake
[51:31] when the pillar of fire led them he led
[51:34] them exactly to the place he wanted them
[51:36] to be
[51:39] now nothing in their earthly senses
[51:42] declared that that was the right spot
[51:45] and moses didn't even know that that was
[51:48] the right spot in a carnal way in his
[51:50] own human mind he didn't know there was
[51:52] the right spot he just knew god was
[51:53] going to deliver him but he didn't know
[51:55] that this was the right spot he just
[51:57] know god was going to deliver them
[51:59] brother branham says in the message
[52:00] conference from 1960
[52:02] the whosoever will let him come and and
[52:05] right in the line of duty you'll hit the
[52:06] blockade oh i guess all nature just
[52:08] quivered why look what a thing here was
[52:11] moses and israel right in the line of
[52:13] duty with a pillar of fire leading them
[52:17] and led them right down into a trap
[52:20] god likes to get his people in traps
[52:26] praise be to god
[52:28] god it look brother man said it looked
[52:30] like he was a bad general
[52:33] pillar of fire but listen friends if
[52:35] you're following the pillar of fire
[52:36] which to us is the holy ghost because
[52:38] that pillar of fire broke up on the day
[52:40] of pentecost amen and it went into the
[52:42] individuals and now there's individual
[52:44] holy ghost leadership and that holy
[52:46] ghost is leading and guiding you into
[52:48] all truth
[52:49] not your own way his way amen to the
[52:52] revelation of jesus christ in this hour
[52:56] but if that pillar of fire is leading
[52:58] you then that pillar of fire is
[53:00] responsible to get you all the way there
[53:02] it's responsible for every turn and
[53:04] every deliverance all your protection
[53:06] and everything you need is the holy
[53:08] ghost is responsible for it because the
[53:10] holy ghost is leading you and if the
[53:12] holy ghost has led you into a trap then
[53:15] the trap is the safest place to be
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] look look read the bible how many times
[53:24] amen did the situation get impossible
[53:26] how many times did god lead them to the
[53:29] impossible how many times did god lead
[53:30] them in such a way that there's no way
[53:33] out over and over and over and over
[53:35] again because that's always the hour of
[53:38] deliverance god is setting a trap he's
[53:40] laying an ambush for his enemy not
[53:43] laying not sending you to the enemy's
[53:46] ambush
[53:48] you're just debate
[53:54] are you comfortable being debate
[53:57] it just depends on how good a shot your
[53:59] father is
[54:05] if you're bear bait
[54:07] and you're sitting out in the woods
[54:08] waiting for the bear to come
[54:10] and your father's 200 yards over
[54:14] you better have confidence your dad's a
[54:16] good shot
[54:19] and our father's a good
[54:23] yes shot israel was debate
[54:27] because god was going to destroy
[54:28] pharaoh's army
[54:31] and he moved in their heart to come
[54:32] chase them down they were defenseless
[54:36] they were helpless
[54:38] they were completely incapable of any
[54:41] they were good bait
[54:45] they were like a chicken in the face of
[54:47] a wolf
[54:50] but pharaoh didn't know that god was a
[54:53] good shot
[54:55] and he had a path in the water
[54:58] and he had to get them to this certain
[54:59] spot
[55:01] because this trap wasn't for israel this
[55:04] trap was for pharaoh and his army
[55:07] haman built a gallow
[55:09] for mordecai but it was never intended
[55:12] to be used on mordecai haman built his
[55:14] own gallow that he would hang from the
[55:17] devils tried to lay a trap for this
[55:19] bride and all he's going to do is get
[55:21] trapped in his own trap
[55:24] but we're going to have to stay humble
[55:26] and reverent and in action amen and it
[55:28] may get worse and it may look bad amen
[55:31] it may look like everything fell apart
[55:33] just like it did in jesus ministry jesus
[55:36] had lost his ministry
[55:38] in the eyes of human eye and the human
[55:41] beings he he was finished
[55:44] all of his disciples scattered amen the
[55:46] seventy had left and the multitudes have
[55:48] left him the whole nation now had turned
[55:50] against him and crying out for his blood
[55:52] amen and when they come to arrest him
[55:53] amen his very closest friends and
[55:56] disciples vanished and deserted him he
[55:58] had lost everything but that was the
[56:00] trap he set for the devil that wasn't
[56:02] the trap for the son of god that was the
[56:04] trap for the devil because he was
[56:06] waiting for that little bee of death to
[56:08] come by amen he was looking helpless and
[56:10] looking weak and looking like a little
[56:12] lamb nailed to the cross he was at the
[56:14] subject of roman soldiers and then he
[56:16] had been spit on and being mocked and
[56:18] his beard ripped out of his face and he
[56:20] could have destroyed them all with the
[56:21] move of his finger but he laid there
[56:23] like a helpless lamb
[56:26] why because he was setting a trap for
[56:29] the devil and when the devil saw that
[56:30] this man has no power this man can't do
[56:32] anything he brought that little bee of
[56:34] death around and when it stuck inside of
[56:36] him he grabbed a hold of the stinger and
[56:38] he said i got you now
[56:40] and he pulled the sting of death out so
[56:42] that we could have eternal life
[56:45] and if he did it then he'll do it again
[56:48] [Music]
[56:49] don't be afraid when everything looks
[56:51] bad
[56:53] the trap's not for you
[56:57] the traps for the devil
[57:00] and god's going to do in such a way only
[57:02] he can get the glory
[57:04] he's the only one that can get glory
[57:06] that you're you'll be so you'll be so uh
[57:09] you'll be so confused and so unsure in
[57:11] your carnal mind of what's happening the
[57:13] only thing that'll hold is the anchor in
[57:15] the soul and standing on the word of god
[57:17] but it won't be ability it won't be the
[57:19] ability in the mind or the ability in
[57:20] the flesh we'll be down to where there's
[57:22] nothing humidly we can do about it amen
[57:24] but stand having done all to stand stand
[57:28] [Music]
[57:28] [Applause]
[57:29] don't fear stand still and see the
[57:31] salvation of the lord
[57:35] god likes to get his people in traps
[57:37] we're back in conference
[57:40] see what they'll do
[57:43] every son that cometh to god must first
[57:45] be tried and chastened he gets them
[57:47] there he brings you here he puts you in
[57:49] between opinions
[57:52] now could that be mental to lefty could
[57:54] it be see he puts you in a trap to see
[57:57] what kind of decision you're going to
[57:58] make
[58:00] that's right search the scriptures jesus
[58:02] said they are they that testify on me
[58:04] that's right
[58:05] now god lets it get that way now he
[58:08] brought israel right into the trap
[58:09] mountains and deserts on both sides
[58:11] pharaoh army pursuing thousands of
[58:14] chariots and spears and a bunch of
[58:15] humble little poor slaves not armed with
[58:17] nothing come down to the dead sea or the
[58:20] red sea rather right down to its banks
[58:22] and here was the dust of the chariots
[58:24] coming and here was the mountains on
[58:26] either side no way looked like god was a
[58:28] bad military man
[58:30] left his people with no retreat
[58:33] praise god because their retreat was
[58:35] right through that ocean
[58:37] it was right through the red sea but
[58:39] nobody on the earth knew it
[58:46] seemed like he
[58:49] looked like a god was a bad military man
[58:51] left his people no retreat sometimes he
[58:53] does that let the doctor walk away and
[58:55] say you ain't going to live you're going
[58:57] to die that cancer is going to kill you
[59:00] you'll never get up out of that chair he
[59:02] seemed like he leaves you with no
[59:03] retreat but he is your retreat
[59:07] climb back into his arms
[59:10] god he's my refuge he's my mighty tower
[59:13] the name of the lord is a mighty tower
[59:15] the righteous run into and are safe the
[59:17] towers of refuge he is our refuge no

[59:35] the the government's trying to pass a 2
[59:38] trillion dollar bailout
[59:41] it won't bail out anything
[59:45] the only bailout is a translation
[59:51] praise the lord

[1:00:17] seen god do and were still carnal

[1:00:22] laying in the path of duty they were on
[1:00:24] their road marching then come out there
[1:00:26] was a pillar of fire before them and

[1:02:06] somehow or another his grace is
[1:02:08] sufficient to carry us through it
[1:02:10] has he ever done that for you
[1:02:13] if he did it once he'll do it again
[1:02:16] and if he did it for you if i can come
[1:02:17] under the same conditions with the same
[1:02:19] faith he'll do it for me
[1:02:22] is that right
[1:02:23] so if he did it for you and if he did it
[1:02:25] for the children of israel and if he did
[1:02:27] it for the three hebrew children and if
[1:02:28] he did it for daniel and the lions and
[1:02:30] if he did it for each one of them when
[1:02:32] they met the conditions in the path of
[1:02:34] duty if he did it for them if i can come
[1:02:36] the same way they came when the same
[1:02:38] condition with the same faith he'll do
[1:02:40] it for me
[1:02:44] praise god
[1:02:48] let's go back to exodus 15.
[1:03:05] exodus 15 and 22.
[1:03:11] so moses brought israel from the red sea
[1:03:14] and they went out into the wilderness of
[1:03:15] sure and they went three days in the
[1:03:17] wilderness and found no water
[1:03:20] and when they came to
[1:03:22] tomorrow they could not drink of the
[1:03:24] waters of mara for they were bitter
[1:03:26] therefore the name of it was called mara
[1:03:28] and the people murmured against moses
[1:03:29] saying what shall we drink
[1:03:32] and he cried unto the lord and the lord
[1:03:33] showed him a tree which when he had cast
[1:03:35] it into the waters the waters were made
[1:03:37] sweet
[1:03:38] there he made for them a statue and an
[1:03:40] ordinance and there he proved them
[1:03:43] and said if thou wilt diligently hearken
[1:03:45] to the voice of the lord thy god and
[1:03:47] we'll do that which is right in his
[1:03:49] sight and will give ear to his
[1:03:51] commandments and keep all the statutes i
[1:03:54] will put none of these diseases upon
[1:03:55] thee which i have brought upon the
[1:03:57] egyptians for i am the lord that healeth
[1:03:59] thee
[1:04:03] do you believe that
[1:04:05] you've got to keep his word
[1:04:07] he said you've got to keep you keep my
[1:04:09] word
[1:04:10] and if we keep his word he'll keep it
[1:04:15] see they went three days journey from
[1:04:18] the red sea
[1:04:19] three days
[1:04:21] and they couldn't find water
[1:04:24] and they begin to murmur and complain
[1:04:26] and cry out against moses say what are
[1:04:28] we going to drink there's no water
[1:04:30] god had just moved thousands and
[1:04:33] thousands of gallons of water
[1:04:36] and parted it where it stood up like a
[1:04:38] wall on the right hand and on the left
[1:04:40] hand and they didn't go on on mushy
[1:04:42] ground or wet ground they went across on
[1:04:44] dry ground
[1:04:46] and three days later they're asking
[1:04:49] moses this water's bitter where are we
[1:04:51] going to get water my goodness what
[1:04:54] happens to us human beings
[1:04:57] see they were stuck in a slave mind in a
[1:05:00] slave mind they couldn't do anything for
[1:05:01] themselves they just took the conditions
[1:05:04] as they were and just grumbled and
[1:05:05] complained about it but god is trying to
[1:05:07] train them out of that into something
[1:05:10] else and he brought them there to prove
[1:05:12] them
[1:05:13] and he's bringing them from one test to
[1:05:15] the next test to the next test and if
[1:05:18] you watch the progression through the
[1:05:20] exodus journey amen the punishment gets
[1:05:23] greater and greater with each test that
[1:05:25] they fail because they're supposed to be
[1:05:27] growing up
[1:05:31] when they come to the red sea
[1:05:35] and they're up against it they begin to
[1:05:36] cry out god doesn't punish them
[1:05:40] is that right
[1:05:41] he just makes a way for them and
[1:05:43] explains to them don't be afraid stand
[1:05:45] still and see the salvation of god they
[1:05:47] go across three days later when they cry
[1:05:50] out he says hey
[1:05:52] i'll take care of this
[1:05:54] he shows him a tree
[1:05:56] cuts it and puts it in the water turns
[1:05:57] its sweet and says i've done this to
[1:05:59] prove you to test you to prove to you
[1:06:02] now if you'll keep my word
[1:06:04] i want to show you something now i'm
[1:06:06] telling you i can heal this water
[1:06:09] and if i can heal this water i can heal
[1:06:10] you
[1:06:14] i'm the lord that healeth all thy
[1:06:16] diseases
[1:06:19] but as they march on
[1:06:23] the more tests
[1:06:25] the more severe the punishment
[1:06:27] because he's trying to mature them into
[1:06:30] a place of maturity to know how to trust
[1:06:33] him and keep his word and follow the
[1:06:35] pillar of fire
[1:06:38] he speaks in redemption and completeness
[1:06:40] and joy
[1:06:42] 1954 he said let's look into this i see
[1:06:44] him i got one prescription
[1:06:46] i'm the lord that healeth thee that
[1:06:48] settled it amen
[1:06:49] said oh moses my father has been over
[1:06:51] here he just fell and broke his leg what
[1:06:53] have you got for him
[1:06:55] let me look and see if thou obey my
[1:06:58] voice do all my commandment i'll put
[1:06:59] none of these diseases upon you as the
[1:07:01] egyptians for i am the lord that healeth
[1:07:02] thee tell him that he got well amen
[1:07:05] that's right
[1:07:06] brother brother dr moses is writing the
[1:07:09] prescription
[1:07:10] keep the commandments obey the word
[1:07:12] you've done that okay i'm the god that
[1:07:13] healeth thee go tell him that he got
[1:07:15] well
[1:07:16] amen
[1:07:22] oh he's seriously sick my baby has got
[1:07:24] colic or pneumonia so bad dr moses what
[1:07:27] can i do let me see what i got i am the
[1:07:29] lord to heal at thee that settles it
[1:07:31] amen away they went going on rejoicing
[1:07:33] that's all he needed i'm the lord that
[1:07:36] healeth thee
[1:07:38] moses wrote the prescription it's still
[1:07:40] good today
[1:07:42] i'm the lord that healeth thee keep his
[1:07:44] commandments obey the word of god he's
[1:07:46] the lord that healeth thee
[1:07:50] hebrews chapter 4 19 57 brother brahman
[1:07:53] says now they were following moses as
[1:07:55] moses followed the pillar and cloud
[1:07:58] and they were on their way to the
[1:07:59] promised land beautiful picture of the
[1:08:01] church tonight on our way to the
[1:08:03] promised land led by the same spirit
[1:08:05] same signs and wonders as god spoke of
[1:08:08] now notice then they come to the
[1:08:10] wilderness of sin the waters were bitter
[1:08:12] mara why did god lead them to the bitter
[1:08:15] waters looks like he'd have led them to
[1:08:17] good water but he led them to bitter
[1:08:19] water so he could prove their faith
[1:08:23] has he ever led you to bitter waters
[1:08:26] of troubles
[1:08:28] need
[1:08:29] he's proving your faith
[1:08:33] he led him to bitter water so he could
[1:08:34] prove their faith he likes to do it
[1:08:37] listen we might as well get comfortable
[1:08:39] with this fact he likes to do it
[1:08:42] he he'll lead you to a trap
[1:08:45] amen because he likes to show himself
[1:08:47] mighty on your behalf
[1:08:49] he'll lead you to bitter waters to prove
[1:08:51] you he likes to do it
[1:08:53] brother baby said god loves to prove his
[1:08:55] children
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:09:00] he likes to do it he likes to let
[1:09:02] tribulations come on you
[1:09:04] now listen i didn't say that
[1:09:06] the prophet of god said that
[1:09:08] he likes to let tribulations come on you
[1:09:11] get comfortable with that fact right now
[1:09:15] might as well just get comfortable with
[1:09:17] that because if we don't get comfortable
[1:09:18] with that the next time tribulations
[1:09:20] come we're going to be like moses god
[1:09:22] why did you send me here
[1:09:25] why is all this happening hey nothing's
[1:09:28] out of kilter all these things have to
[1:09:30] be this way the clock's ticking just
[1:09:31] right on time these things have to be
[1:09:34] like this
[1:09:38] god likes to let tribulations come on
[1:09:40] you show he can so he can show you his
[1:09:43] love and his power
[1:09:48] when the tribulations come
[1:09:50] start looking up
[1:09:52] because he wants to show you his love
[1:09:54] and his power that's the time to start
[1:09:56] getting excited amen when there's no way
[1:09:58] out of this when the trouble is coming
[1:10:00] hot and fast and i can't figure out what
[1:10:02] to do about it but i know i'm in the
[1:10:04] line of duty i know i'm right with god
[1:10:06] i've searched my life i know i'm where
[1:10:08] i'm supposed to be with him i know i'm
[1:10:10] in the light of the hour i know the holy
[1:10:12] ghost is upon me now i'm going to watch
[1:10:14] for his deliverance
[1:10:19] how can people today who doesn't believe
[1:10:21] in the miracle working of god when
[1:10:23] tribulations come they just give up and
[1:10:25] go on
[1:10:27] but we believe that god works miracles
[1:10:30] listen to this if god doesn't act the
[1:10:32] same then the same circumstances arise
[1:10:34] then god is guilty of being partial to
[1:10:36] his people
[1:10:39] this is good news friends well the
[1:10:41] prophet is telling us right now is
[1:10:43] really good news because we all have a
[1:10:45] bible and we can all read the bible and
[1:10:47] we can all read the message and we go
[1:10:49] back to this he says
[1:10:51] if god doesn't act the same when the
[1:10:53] same circumstances arise then god is
[1:10:56] guilty of being partial to his people
[1:10:59] god's sovereignty demands of him to work
[1:11:01] in every case like he did the first case
[1:11:04] or he was wrong when he worked in the
[1:11:06] first case
[1:11:07] if god does not act in the same way he
[1:11:09] did on the first case if he will act
[1:11:11] different to the second case then he
[1:11:13] acted wrong when he acted on the first
[1:11:14] case
[1:11:15] if god healed the sick in the old
[1:11:17] testament he's got to do it in the new
[1:11:19] testament and today or he did wrong when
[1:11:21] he healed them back there
[1:11:23] he's got to act the same every time and
[1:11:25] he will do it when the same faith meets
[1:11:28] the condition
[1:11:30] the fault is in us not in god
[1:11:34] when the same faith meets to the
[1:11:36] condition he'll do it the fault's never
[1:11:38] his
[1:11:44] exodus 16
[1:11:46] verse 4
[1:11:48] we're we're following the children of
[1:11:50] egypt and all these experiences where
[1:11:52] god is testing them and proving them
[1:11:54] now we'll look at this one in exodus 16
[1:11:56] 4.
[1:11:59] then said the lord unto moses behold i
[1:12:01] will reign bread from heaven for you and
[1:12:03] the people shall go out and gather a
[1:12:04] certain rate every day that i may prove
[1:12:07] them whether they will walk in my law or
[1:12:09] no
[1:12:10] this is a different kind of test
[1:12:13] now he's going to test them in greed and
[1:12:15] in prosperity
[1:12:18] he's tested them in the face of armies
[1:12:21] in the face of lack and need
[1:12:24] and now they've lacked bread and they
[1:12:26] need bread they needed water he provided
[1:12:28] water he tested them there they needed
[1:12:30] deliverance from armies he provided
[1:12:31] deliverance from armies and now they
[1:12:33] need bread he gives them bread but he
[1:12:35] gives an abundance of bread
[1:12:39] and he's going to give them
[1:12:42] rules
[1:12:43] to gathering this bread
[1:12:46] only so much per person only so much for
[1:12:48] a family and on the sixth day you gather
[1:12:50] enough for two days don't take too much
[1:12:52] because it'll spoil
[1:12:57] every test we get isn't always hardship
[1:13:01] sometimes our tests are prosperity
[1:13:06] will we keep his word with the abundance
[1:13:10] or will greed set in
[1:13:13] god is trying to train them in all
[1:13:16] things
[1:13:17] and god is trying to train us
[1:13:19] in all things
[1:13:32] let's go to numbers 21.
[1:13:47] numbers 21 verse 4.
[1:13:56] and they journeyed from mount hore by
[1:13:58] the way of the red sea to compass the
[1:14:00] land of edom and the soul of the people
[1:14:02] was much discouraged because of the way
[1:14:06] god is leading them to the promised land
[1:14:10] and they're discouraged because it's a
[1:14:11] hard
[1:14:12] way and god is leading us to the
[1:14:15] promised land
[1:14:16] don't get discouraged because it's a
[1:14:18] hard way
[1:14:22] and the people spake against god and
[1:14:24] against moses wherefore have you brought
[1:14:26] us up out of egypt to die in the
[1:14:28] wilderness
[1:14:29] for there is no bread neither is there
[1:14:31] any water and our soul loatheth this
[1:14:34] light bread
[1:14:37] and the lord sent fiery serpents among
[1:14:39] the people and they bit the people and
[1:14:41] much people of israel died
[1:14:44] you see everything's beginning to change
[1:14:46] as he's starting to mature his church
[1:14:49] when they come against the red sea
[1:14:51] they were just
[1:14:52] just fresh out of slavery and bondage
[1:14:56] just fresh out
[1:14:57] and god made a way for them they went
[1:14:59] through and they sang and dance on the
[1:15:01] other side and three days later they're
[1:15:02] crying again because no water but it's
[1:15:04] okay he heals the water and proves to
[1:15:06] them that he can heal them gives them a
[1:15:08] promise and then they go a little bit
[1:15:09] further and have no more bread and they
[1:15:10] cry out and he gives them bread and he's
[1:15:12] going to test them in the giving of
[1:15:13] bread to make sure that they're not
[1:15:15] greedy and they'll still keep his word
[1:15:20] but now they come to another test when
[1:15:22] they when they begin to grumble and
[1:15:24] complain because the way is hard because
[1:15:26] when they come out of slavery amen they
[1:15:28] had the promise that he's going to give
[1:15:30] them a promised land that floweth with
[1:15:32] milk and honey and all they could think
[1:15:34] of was the milk and honey but they never
[1:15:36] thought of paying a price to get to the
[1:15:37] milk and honey
[1:15:40] they didn't know it was going to require
[1:15:41] anything of them they didn't know that
[1:15:43] they were going to have to go through
[1:15:44] tribulation and trouble and hardship in
[1:15:46] a difficult way and be tested and be
[1:15:48] tried they just thought that i'm going
[1:15:50] to get the milk and honey amen the
[1:15:51] pillar of fire is here the prophet is
[1:15:53] here we're just going to get the milk
[1:15:55] and honey but to get to the milk and
[1:15:57] honey you've got to pass the test you've
[1:16:00] got to endure the wilderness journey
[1:16:02] you've got to stay true to the word amen
[1:16:05] you've got to obey god you've got to do
[1:16:07] what he's leading you to do not too much
[1:16:10] not too little but stay true to his word
[1:16:14] and now
[1:16:16] god was reigning manna from heaven
[1:16:20] and they got tired
[1:16:22] of the message
[1:16:26] and they wanted to spice it up a little
[1:16:28] bit
[1:16:30] they wanted a little something else to
[1:16:31] go with they cried for meat one time and
[1:16:34] they got quails until it was coming out
[1:16:36] their nose and a plague came with it and
[1:16:38] now they said now we don't have any good
[1:16:40] bread
[1:16:41] they had bread
[1:16:43] god gave them exactly what they needed
[1:16:46] amen they went out there was not a
[1:16:48] feeble one among them through the
[1:16:49] journey this bread was the bread that
[1:16:52] kept them healthy and kept them strong
[1:16:54] amen and moved them on the journey and
[1:16:56] they began to loathe this light bread
[1:17:00] and they wanted a little something extra
[1:17:02] to spice it up a little bit
[1:17:04] something to go with it something else
[1:17:06] amen make it a little more appealing a
[1:17:08] little more appetizing get it get it
[1:17:10] let's get a little bit excited let's
[1:17:12] have a little bit of a show amen it
[1:17:14] doesn't need a show just take the bread
[1:17:16] that's coming from heaven and feed on it
[1:17:18] because it's going to give us strength
[1:17:20] for the journey and there won't be a
[1:17:21] feeble manga one one among us
[1:17:23] spiritually it will just take the bread
[1:17:25] from heaven
[1:17:27] we don't have to alter it and we don't
[1:17:29] have to spice it up we don't have to
[1:17:30] make it more exciting we don't have to
[1:17:32] put a program together we don't have to
[1:17:34] have a special camp we don't have to
[1:17:35] spice up the music just take the bread
[1:17:38] that he's given us and eat that bread
[1:17:40] every day for the journey
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:46] friends we've been given everything we
[1:17:48] need
[1:17:50] but it was never going to be a sunday
[1:17:52] school picnic because god is trying to
[1:17:55] instill in his bright character for
[1:17:57] reigning
[1:17:58] and he was trying to take this nation of
[1:18:01] slaves
[1:18:03] and he was going to give them a land and
[1:18:05] make them the rulers over the land but
[1:18:07] he couldn't pluck them out as slaves and
[1:18:09] stick them as rulers of the land they
[1:18:11] would have no idea what to do they
[1:18:14] needed to be trained and how to manage
[1:18:16] the land they needed to be trained and
[1:18:18] how to be disciplined they needed to
[1:18:20] learn to work
[1:18:22] they needed to learn to obey
[1:18:25] they needed to learn to trust
[1:18:27] or they would have lost the land
[1:18:31] and 50 some years ago we weren't ready
[1:18:33] to take the millennium
[1:18:38] god has been training his bride through
[1:18:40] all kinds of circumstances and training
[1:18:42] her why because we're going to rule over
[1:18:45] the land with christ
[1:18:48] and he's getting us in position to rule
[1:18:50] over that land
[1:18:51] amen no more crying about hardship no
[1:18:54] more crying about things not working out
[1:18:57] but now's the time to trust now is the
[1:18:59] time to believe the word now is the time
[1:19:01] to stand knowing that you've done all to
[1:19:04] stand now stand and see the salvation of
[1:19:06] the lord now it's time to expect the
[1:19:08] miraculous because we did what he told
[1:19:10] us to do now he'll do what he's done
[1:19:12] before
[1:19:17] isn't the time
[1:19:19] to be a slave
[1:19:21] isn't the time to be a child
[1:19:24] this is a different age friends
[1:19:27] and we know that they finally come to
[1:19:29] katis barnea
[1:19:31] and in katie's barnea the expression of
[1:19:34] unbelief was so great
[1:19:37] that god would not forgive that
[1:19:39] generation
[1:19:41] but he would smite every one of them
[1:19:43] saving caleb and joshua
[1:19:46] why what was the difference
[1:19:48] caleb and joshua fully believed the
[1:19:50] promise
[1:19:52] the other ones partially believed the
[1:19:54] promise
[1:19:55] but when they went to spy out the land
[1:19:57] and they saw that it was going to
[1:19:59] require effort and hardship to take the
[1:20:02] land they said it's too much for us we
[1:20:04] can't take this land
[1:20:06] but caleb he had faith in the promise of
[1:20:09] god he didn't have faith in his ability
[1:20:11] he had faith in what moses had told him
[1:20:13] that god had said
[1:20:16] and he said would we be more than able
[1:20:18] to take the life god if god be with us
[1:20:20] we're more than able to take this land
[1:20:22] he was looking at the word they were
[1:20:24] looking at the circumstances amen and
[1:20:26] they they then they got so angry with
[1:20:29] moses amen they wanted to form a captain
[1:20:32] to go back to egypt again
[1:20:36] why because egypt was easy we're told
[1:20:38] what to do we do what we're told to do
[1:20:40] we do it every way hey the flesh pots
[1:20:43] were full and we had bread to eat and
[1:20:44] garlic and leeks and everything else
[1:20:48] what was it no personal responsibility
[1:20:51] no personal suffering and no growth
[1:20:56] back in the systems no growth no
[1:20:58] spiritual growth at all stay here you
[1:21:01] work for the system we feed you what
[1:21:03] you're supposed to eat and there's
[1:21:04] plenty of this food
[1:21:07] oh give me the light bread give me a
[1:21:09] daily dose of the light bread that comes
[1:21:11] from heaven i don't need a program i
[1:21:13] don't need a system i don't need
[1:21:15] something spicy just give me that bread
[1:21:17] that came from god and the message of
[1:21:19] the hour and let me eat it every day of
[1:21:21] my life lord
[1:21:23] and help me to overcome every obstacle
[1:21:26] by your grace
[1:21:29] so god made a change at cadiz barnea
[1:21:32] this generation isn't going in but
[1:21:34] there's going to be a new generation go
[1:21:36] in and this generation isn't the
[1:21:39] generation with a slave mindset but this
[1:21:41] is a generation that's come up in
[1:21:43] freedom amen and they don't want to go
[1:21:45] back you notice this new generation no
[1:21:48] matter what they face they never one
[1:21:50] time asked to go back to egypt
[1:21:56] and what happens
[1:21:58] they watch more tests and more trials
[1:22:03] after cadish barnea they see cora dathan
[1:22:05] and the byron rise up now it's not an
[1:22:08] outside pressure coming in it's not
[1:22:10] starvation or hunger or need for water
[1:22:12] or armies now there's spirits rising up
[1:22:15] right inside the church
[1:22:17] trying to correct the prophet trying to
[1:22:20] be equal to the prophet of god
[1:22:24] and watch them fall
[1:22:27] into the earth
[1:22:30] go from there amen to load the bread
[1:22:34] the loathe the loath this this word
[1:22:38] that god has delivered through a seventh
[1:22:40] grade educated prophet
[1:22:43] and want something to put with it
[1:22:46] put a little maybe cayenne pepper or
[1:22:48] something
[1:22:53] they saw the fiery serpent strike them
[1:22:57] what's he doing
[1:22:59] god is teaching this new generation born
[1:23:01] free
[1:23:02] don't do like that
[1:23:04] don't go this way don't go that way and
[1:23:07] the consequences get more severe and
[1:23:10] more severe and more severe until balaam
[1:23:12] teaches balak how to entice him into
[1:23:14] mixed religion again
[1:23:17] accepting things from the denomination
[1:23:19] that they never should have accepted
[1:23:22] forms of denominational worship they
[1:23:24] never should have accepted
[1:23:26] and a plague broke out among them and
[1:23:28] phineas stopped the plague
[1:23:33] you see what's happening
[1:23:35] the next generation is watching
[1:23:38] and learning
[1:23:39] and experiencing through all the
[1:23:41] troubles
[1:23:44] when it comes time to cross
[1:23:46] to the other side to take the promised
[1:23:48] land
[1:23:49] god takes moses off the scene
[1:23:52] and he leads them across by
[1:23:54] by joshua the type of the holy ghost
[1:23:59] because the holy ghost is going to place
[1:24:02] each one individually in their place
[1:24:07] everybody is going to come to their
[1:24:09] adoption everybody under the ministry of
[1:24:12] the holy ghost is going to come to their
[1:24:14] place and they're going to know where
[1:24:15] they belong and they're going to know
[1:24:16] what they're supposed to be doing and
[1:24:18] they're going to be operating and
[1:24:20] functioning individually under the
[1:24:22] leadership of the holy ghost
[1:24:25] it's no longer amen what moses can do
[1:24:28] moses can do moses can do but now when
[1:24:31] joshua moves in it's not what moses does
[1:24:34] and it's not what joshua does joshua
[1:24:36] gets the orders from the head captain
[1:24:38] joshua gives the orders to the camp and
[1:24:40] the camp acts it out
[1:24:43] it wasn't joshua amen that had to hold
[1:24:46] his arms up to win a battle for jericho
[1:24:48] coming down it was the whole army that
[1:24:50] had to march around seven times
[1:24:53] this is now going to start involving the
[1:24:55] whole camp
[1:24:58] amen
[1:24:58] and now
[1:25:00] when one man
[1:25:01] sins
[1:25:03] aiken
[1:25:06] the whole camp suffers
[1:25:10] when that one man sins when joshua the
[1:25:12] holy ghost begins to root it out
[1:25:16] the whole camp acts together to destroy
[1:25:18] that thing and get it moved away from
[1:25:20] them
[1:25:22] things are different
[1:25:24] with that new generation
[1:25:26] when joshua says do something they do it
[1:25:28] they don't murmur they don't complain
[1:25:29] when he says be circumcised or
[1:25:31] circumcised when he says stay back and
[1:25:33] watch when the waters park what they do
[1:25:35] exactly as he says do
[1:25:37] when they say march around and keep
[1:25:39] silent amen for six days and on the
[1:25:41] seventh don't say a word to this they do
[1:25:43] exactly like he says do and whenever
[1:25:45] they follow the leadership of joshua it
[1:25:47] works out perfect
[1:25:49] where did they learn this kind of
[1:25:50] obedience by what they had watched over
[1:25:53] the 40-year journey as everybody else
[1:25:55] had fallen and died
[1:25:59] what has god been trying to do for us
[1:26:01] get us into a position we can be an army
[1:26:03] like that when the holy ghost says move
[1:26:05] we move but he says be quiet we're quiet
[1:26:07] when he says wait to cross we wait to
[1:26:09] cross if he says be circumcised and get
[1:26:11] rid of the extra flesh will you
[1:26:12] circumcise again and get rid of the
[1:26:14] extra flesh
[1:26:16] he's getting an army amen that'll do
[1:26:18] what he said do and when joshua says
[1:26:20] there's sin in the camp amen they'll go
[1:26:22] through until they find the sin and then
[1:26:24] they all work together not just joshua
[1:26:27] but everybody stoned them to death
[1:26:31] this is this was serious now this was a
[1:26:33] serious army that was moving in to take
[1:26:35] the land
[1:26:37] they were moving under the promises they
[1:26:39] were moving under the leadership and
[1:26:40] they were moving by the holy ghost
[1:26:44] it's a different day
[1:26:46] a different generation
[1:26:53] let's go to
[1:26:54] mark chapter six
[1:27:14] mark chapter six
[1:27:17] let's go to verse 34.
[1:27:24] and jesus when he came out he saw much
[1:27:26] people and was moved with compassion
[1:27:28] toward them
[1:27:30] because they were a sheep not having a
[1:27:31] shepherd
[1:27:32] and he began to teach them many things
[1:27:35] and when the day was now far spent his
[1:27:37] disciples came unto him and said this is
[1:27:39] a desert place and now the time is far
[1:27:42] past
[1:27:43] send them away that they may go into the
[1:27:44] country round about into the villages
[1:27:47] and buy themselves bread for they have
[1:27:49] nothing to eat
[1:27:51] and i just want to inject here
[1:27:56] over in john 6 he picks up the same
[1:27:58] story and i want to read to you the same
[1:28:00] thing out of john 6 but keep your place
[1:28:02] here in mark we're going to finish it
[1:28:03] here john 6 and 5 when jesus then lifted
[1:28:06] up his eyes and saw a great company come
[1:28:08] unto him he saith unto philip when shall
[1:28:10] we buy bread that these may eat
[1:28:13] and this he said to prove him for he
[1:28:15] himself knew what he would do
[1:28:18] see
[1:28:19] god already knows what he's going to do
[1:28:22] and many times he gets us in a place
[1:28:24] where he's going to prove us but he
[1:28:26] already knows what he's going to do and
[1:28:28] we have to know he already knows what
[1:28:29] he's going to do but he's waiting for us
[1:28:31] to say something he's waiting for us to
[1:28:34] make our decision he's waiting for us to
[1:28:36] stand on the word and he's going to do
[1:28:38] what he's going to do but he's trying to
[1:28:40] prove something teach us get us to move
[1:28:42] get us in action do something god's
[1:28:45] trying to do something through every
[1:28:46] circumstance we've got to be thoroughly
[1:28:49] convinced of that from here on out every
[1:28:51] circumstance that we face that we need
[1:28:53] god to move on the scene god is trying
[1:28:55] to do something
[1:28:59] we've got to come to terms with the fact
[1:29:01] that i'm not lost i'm not wayward i'm
[1:29:03] not out of his will
[1:29:06] if you have those questions in doubt
[1:29:07] settle them tonight
[1:29:10] repent make everything right be led by
[1:29:13] the spirit of god know that you're under
[1:29:15] the token know that your life is lined
[1:29:17] up to the word of god know that there's
[1:29:19] nothing between you and god settle that
[1:29:21] question now so it doesn't come up the
[1:29:22] next time we have trouble
[1:29:25] some at some point we've got to face
[1:29:26] this thing down and say god is there
[1:29:29] anything wrong with me show me now
[1:29:32] because i've got to know that i'm right
[1:29:33] with you i got to know that i'm under
[1:29:35] the token i got to know that the token's
[1:29:37] on display and then i'm obedient to your
[1:29:39] word and there's nothing hindering
[1:29:41] you're moving in my life
[1:29:43] and when you can walk away from that
[1:29:44] prayer and you know with confidence and
[1:29:46] assurance amen that god dwells within
[1:29:48] and there's nothing between you and him
[1:29:50] amen every time we face an obstacle
[1:29:53] don't let the devil whisper in your ear
[1:29:54] you're out of the will of god you're not
[1:29:56] even a child of god he doesn't even care
[1:30:00] settle that issue now because we're
[1:30:02] going to face the situations where the
[1:30:04] devil's going to whisper that in your
[1:30:05] ear and you better already come to terms
[1:30:08] with that
[1:30:10] that way we can stand and see the
[1:30:12] salvation of the lord
[1:30:15] say i didn't put myself in this place
[1:30:17] god led me here
[1:30:19] i didn't make myself what i am god led
[1:30:22] me here i hey i didn't find the message
[1:30:24] the message found me
[1:30:27] i didn't make myself a believer he
[1:30:29] predestinated me to believe this message
[1:30:31] i don't believe it because of intellect
[1:30:32] because i've got intellectual reasons
[1:30:34] not to
[1:30:37] i believe it because i can't help
[1:30:38] believe it it's inside of me it's who i
[1:30:41] am whatever this word is is what i am
[1:30:44] whatever's coming across that tape is
[1:30:46] the same thing that's sounding inside of
[1:30:48] me i'm not a believer by choice i'm not
[1:30:51] a believer by intellect i'm not a
[1:30:53] believer by education i'm a believer by
[1:30:55] predestination i can't not believe this
[1:30:58] message
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:00] that's what we come to terms with
[1:31:02] friends we didn't put ourselves here god
[1:31:04] led us here we didn't make ourselves
[1:31:06] believer he predestinated before the
[1:31:08] foundation of the world when when we he
[1:31:11] knew we were the seed gene of god that
[1:31:12] would come forth in this age we were
[1:31:14] predisposed to connect with the word for
[1:31:17] this age and when the word for this age
[1:31:18] came in contact with the sea gene for
[1:31:20] this age it sparked the life and you
[1:31:23] couldn't control it
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:27] you're not still standing here because
[1:31:29] it's been the most convenient way to
[1:31:31] believe you're not still standing here
[1:31:33] because it's been nothing but blessings
[1:31:36] you're still standing and believing
[1:31:37] because you can't help but believe
[1:31:42] now we just need to fully surrender to
[1:31:44] the word fully obey the word amen and
[1:31:47] march forth with confidence that god's
[1:31:49] leading me in any place he turns me
[1:31:51] whatever obstacle i face there's
[1:31:53] something he wants to accomplish
[1:31:56] he's either training me teaching me
[1:31:58] defeating the devil showing himself
[1:32:01] mighty whatever it is but he's not going
[1:32:03] to give me to question my sonship
[1:32:07] because everything goes wrong everything
[1:32:09] went wrong for
[1:32:10] moses matter of fact everything went
[1:32:13] wrong for jesus
[1:32:16] carnally speaking
[1:32:20] everything went wrong
[1:32:22] but everything was working right
[1:32:29] he said that to prove them
[1:32:32] for he himself knew what he would do
[1:32:35] god already knows what he's going to do
[1:32:37] whatever situation you find yourself in
[1:32:39] tonight he already knows what he's going
[1:32:41] to do he's just wanting to see what
[1:32:42] you'll do
[1:32:45] now it's time to act like a believer
[1:32:51] philip answered him
[1:32:52] 200 penny worth of bread is not
[1:32:54] sufficient for them that every one of
[1:32:56] them may take a little
[1:32:58] now let's go back
[1:33:00] to verse 38
[1:33:02] or verse 37.
[1:33:06] he and i'm sorry in mark 6 mark 6 37 and
[1:33:09] he answered and said unto them give you
[1:33:11] them to eat and they say unto him shall
[1:33:13] we go and buy 200 penny worth of bread
[1:33:15] and give them to eat and he saith to
[1:33:17] them how many loaves have you go and see
[1:33:20] and when they knew they saved five and
[1:33:22] two fishes and he commanded them to make
[1:33:24] all sit down by companies upon the green
[1:33:26] grass and they sat down in ranks by
[1:33:29] hundreds and by fifties and when he had
[1:33:31] taken the five loaves and the two fishes
[1:33:33] he looked up to heaven and blessed and
[1:33:35] break the loaves and gave them to his
[1:33:37] disciples to set before them and the two
[1:33:39] fishes divided he among them all
[1:33:41] and they did all they eat and were
[1:33:43] filled and they took up 12 basketfuls of
[1:33:45] fragments and of fishes
[1:33:48] and they that did eat of the loaves were
[1:33:49] about five thousand men
[1:33:51] verse 45 and straightway he constrained
[1:33:54] his disciples to get into a ship
[1:33:57] you all know the story but i want you to
[1:33:59] read the terminology
[1:34:01] he straightway he constrained his
[1:34:04] disciples to get into the ship
[1:34:07] who's in control of this situation
[1:34:13] who told who to get in the ship
[1:34:16] this is the key to the whole thing
[1:34:18] friends
[1:34:20] if the pillar of fire leads you the
[1:34:22] pillar of fire must take responsibility
[1:34:24] for you for whatever shepherds you must
[1:34:26] care for you
[1:34:28] and if the holy ghost is shepherding you
[1:34:29] then the holy ghost must take care of
[1:34:31] you
[1:34:32] remember as the pillar of fire amen it
[1:34:35] was the pillar of fire who led them to
[1:34:36] the trap it was the pillar of the fire
[1:34:38] that went back behind them and became a
[1:34:39] wall of defense so that they could get
[1:34:41] through the red sea
[1:34:43] if christ told them to get in the ship
[1:34:46] then christ had to take care of them
[1:34:48] while they were in the ship because they
[1:34:49] were walking in obedience to the
[1:34:51] leadership of the lord
[1:34:54] this is where our confidence has to come
[1:34:56] friends that we're walking in obedience
[1:34:58] to the leadership of the lord if the
[1:35:00] lord has led you then the lord will take
[1:35:02] care of you all the way to the end it
[1:35:04] doesn't matter how many storms come up
[1:35:06] or how much trouble comes if he led you
[1:35:09] into the ship it doesn't matter if it
[1:35:11] looks like the ship is going the wrong
[1:35:12] way or if everything's coming undone you
[1:35:15] remember who led you to the ship
[1:35:18] reflect back and remember who led me to
[1:35:21] this ship
[1:35:22] who told me to get into this message
[1:35:24] ship
[1:35:27] amen it was the lord himself constrained
[1:35:30] me to get into this message ship because
[1:35:32] this ship is going to the other side and
[1:35:35] he said get into this ship he
[1:35:37] constrained me to get into this strip
[1:35:39] who constrained you to get into this
[1:35:41] shell
[1:35:47] straightway he constrained his disciples
[1:35:49] to get into the ship
[1:35:50] and to go to the other side
[1:35:52] before into beseda while he sent away
[1:35:54] the people
[1:35:56] and we had sent them away he departed
[1:35:58] into a mountain to pray
[1:36:00] and when even was come the ship was in
[1:36:02] the midst of the sea and he alone on the
[1:36:04] land and he saw them toiling and rowing
[1:36:08] for the wind was contrary unto them
[1:36:10] huh imagine that the wind was contrary
[1:36:14] to them
[1:36:16] do you think in this ship we might ever
[1:36:18] face days where the wind will be
[1:36:20] contrary
[1:36:24] the wind was contrary
[1:36:27] to them
[1:36:29] and about the fourth watch of the night
[1:36:31] he cometh unto them walking upon the sea
[1:36:34] and it would have passed by them
[1:36:37] when they saw him walking upon the sea
[1:36:39] they supposed it had been a spirit and
[1:36:41] cried out
[1:36:42] for they all saw him and were troubled
[1:36:44] and immediately he talked with them and
[1:36:46] said unto them be of good cheer it is i
[1:36:50] be not afraid
[1:36:53] who was in control of the storm
[1:36:56] it was him
[1:36:58] who was responsible for delivering them
[1:37:01] the one who told him to get in the ship
[1:37:04] see friends if we could just reflect
[1:37:06] back
[1:37:08] on who told us to get in this ship
[1:37:11] who told you to get in this ship
[1:37:14] was it your mom
[1:37:15] your dad
[1:37:17] a friend
[1:37:18] a spouse because if they're the ones who
[1:37:20] told you to get in the ship when the
[1:37:22] wind becomes the contrary and the
[1:37:24] thing's about to sing they're the ones
[1:37:26] who are going to have to take care of
[1:37:27] you
[1:37:30] if it was your best friend if it was
[1:37:32] your wife or your husband or your mom or
[1:37:34] your dad or you're here because of one
[1:37:36] of your kids constrain you to get in the
[1:37:38] ship if that's the reason you're in the
[1:37:41] boat i'm telling you contrary winds are
[1:37:43] starting to blow
[1:37:46] and the sea is going to get tossed and
[1:37:48] whoever told you to get in the boat is
[1:37:50] the one who's going to have to make
[1:37:52] provision for you and take care of you
[1:37:53] and you better rest assured that the one
[1:37:56] who puts you in the boat is the one who
[1:37:57] can meet you in the midst of the sea by
[1:37:59] walking on the water it better not be
[1:38:02] anything fleshly or nothing of this
[1:38:04] world but it better be god who's led you
[1:38:07] into this word and god who led you into
[1:38:09] this place because if the holy ghost led
[1:38:11] you here then the holy ghost has to take
[1:38:13] you all the way through
[1:38:19] i want to i want to jump back
[1:38:22] to verse 48.
[1:38:27] this is verse 47
[1:38:29] and when even was come the ship was in
[1:38:32] the midst of the sea and he alone on the
[1:38:34] land now listen friends
[1:38:36] that's miles and miles and miles away
[1:38:40] they were in the middle of the sea and
[1:38:42] he was still on the mountain in the land
[1:38:46] next verse and he saw them toiling
[1:38:49] in the rowing
[1:38:53] this was not with natural eyes
[1:38:57] he couldn't have seen them
[1:38:59] in the middle of the sea
[1:39:02] he was watching them the whole time
[1:39:07] they thought
[1:39:08] that he put them in the boat
[1:39:11] and left and didn't know what was
[1:39:13] happening in the boat
[1:39:16] but he was watching the whole time and
[1:39:18] he was watching them toiling and rowing
[1:39:21] he knew exactly the predicament they
[1:39:23] were in his eye was on them he knew
[1:39:26] where they were and he knew what
[1:39:27] situation he was in and he knew what he
[1:39:29] would do about it
[1:39:32] and in the middle of the storm when
[1:39:34] everything was contrary and it looked
[1:39:35] like all would be lost and they were
[1:39:37] afraid he come walking he coming away
[1:39:40] nobody expected him to come
[1:39:43] any coming away nobody else could come
[1:39:47] listen that's the way he always comes he
[1:39:50] comes in a way nobody expected him to
[1:39:52] come and he comes in a way nobody else
[1:39:54] could come but sometimes when we begin
[1:39:57] to see the solution that god has we
[1:39:59] begin to be afraid because it's so
[1:40:01] unusual and so out of the ordinary he's
[1:40:03] got to say hey
[1:40:05] be of good courage it is i be not afraid
[1:40:08] i'm in control of the storm i'm showing
[1:40:10] up on the scene i'm pro-coming to
[1:40:12] deliver you
[1:40:16] it is i
[1:40:17] be of good cheer
[1:40:19] it is i be not afraid
[1:40:23] and he went it went up into them into
[1:40:25] the ship and the wind ceased and they
[1:40:27] were sore amazing themselves beyond
[1:40:29] measure and wondered for they considered
[1:40:32] not the miracle of the loaves
[1:40:34] for their heart was hardened
[1:40:41] that word hardened
[1:40:43] means to cover with a thick skin
[1:40:46] to harden by covering with a callus
[1:40:49] metaphorically to make the heart dull to
[1:40:52] grow hard callous become dull lose the
[1:40:55] power of understanding
[1:40:59] immediately
[1:41:01] they kind he shows up and he steps into
[1:41:03] the boat and calms the waters everything
[1:41:06] calms the trial's over
[1:41:09] and they were what they wandered with
[1:41:11] great amazement
[1:41:13] because they forgot the loaves and the
[1:41:14] fish
[1:41:17] they forgot the loaves and the fish
[1:41:19] and their heart was hardener dull of
[1:41:21] understanding
[1:41:23] calloused over
[1:41:25] what do loaves and fish have to do with
[1:41:27] the storm on the sea
[1:41:30] everything
[1:41:32] the one who can create more loaves and
[1:41:35] fish by breaking it
[1:41:38] is the one who can calm the sea
[1:41:41] and the one who healed you of flu
[1:41:46] one who delivered you and gave you a job
[1:41:48] when it didn't look like you'd get the
[1:41:49] job
[1:41:51] and the one who saved you in the car
[1:41:52] accident looked like you were you were
[1:41:54] definitely going to wreck and somehow
[1:41:55] you didn't
[1:41:57] don't forget the loaves and fish friends
[1:42:00] this is not the hour to forget the
[1:42:01] loaves and fish
[1:42:03] the one who healed your baby when you
[1:42:04] prayed for them the one who gave you a
[1:42:06] spouse when you prayed the one who's
[1:42:08] done everything don't let your heart be
[1:42:10] hardened and dull of understanding amen
[1:42:12] the one who can heal a flu can heal
[1:42:14] every disease and virus amen the one who
[1:42:17] can deliver financial trouble can
[1:42:19] deliver from any trouble don't forget
[1:42:22] the loaves and fish
[1:42:24] this is the time to remind one another
[1:42:26] gather your family around in the family
[1:42:28] altar and start to share your testimony
[1:42:30] with your children refresh the loaves
[1:42:32] and fresh remind yourself that he
[1:42:34] delivered us when we didn't know how we
[1:42:36] would be delivered he provided when
[1:42:38] there was no provision he did something
[1:42:40] in a way we never expected amen he come
[1:42:43] and showed up in a way we never dreamed
[1:42:48] they were troubled and they were amazed
[1:42:50] but they shouldn't have been
[1:42:53] they forgot the loaves and the fish
[1:42:58] who told you to get in the boat
[1:43:02] the same one that's watching you toil
[1:43:05] and knows the winds are contrary
[1:43:09] and he's the one who can show up on the
[1:43:10] scene when nobody else can get to you
[1:43:15] nobody else they were in the midst of
[1:43:19] the sea
[1:43:20] nobody else could get to them but the
[1:43:22] one who puts you in the boat is the one
[1:43:24] that's been watching he's the same one
[1:43:26] who can get to you and nobody else can
[1:43:27] get to you
[1:43:30] but don't be amazed or afraid when he
[1:43:32] shows up watch for him be expecting him
[1:43:34] to come in an unexpected way expect him
[1:43:37] to walk on the water
[1:43:41] and if he bid you come you walk on the
[1:43:43] water
[1:43:45] start watching
[1:43:47] for the miraculous start watching for
[1:43:49] the amazing why
[1:43:51] because he's already done the loaves and
[1:43:53] the fish
[1:43:56] he's already
[1:43:58] delivered us he's already healed us how
[1:44:00] many of you can say he's the lord that
[1:44:01] healeth all your diseases
[1:44:04] then what are we afraid of i mean how
[1:44:07] many can say that he's delivered you
[1:44:08] when there seemed to be no way of
[1:44:09] deliverance and he's provided when you
[1:44:11] saw no provision then what in the world
[1:44:13] do we have afraid of don't let our
[1:44:15] hearts be hardened in this hour amen he
[1:44:17] put us in the boat
[1:44:19] the winds are beginning to blow friends
[1:44:21] and they're going to get a whole lot
[1:44:22] worse than this but he's watching you
[1:44:24] toil in the ship you're in the boat he
[1:44:26] puts you in you're toiling and you're
[1:44:28] laboring amen just have faith that at
[1:44:31] the right time he's going to show up in
[1:44:33] an unexpected way and he's going to get
[1:44:35] to you when nobody else can get to you
[1:44:38] how do you know because he's already
[1:44:40] done the lows and the fish
[1:44:43] this isn't the hour to have a hard heart
[1:44:45] this isn't the hour to be afraid and to
[1:44:47] be amazed at all the trouble this is the
[1:44:49] hour to have faith friends and have an
[1:44:51] expectation that he's going to come
[1:44:53] walking on the water
[1:44:57] just when it looks like all is lost
[1:45:01] he shows up
[1:45:03] and when he shows up
[1:45:05] the contrary winds are over
[1:45:08] the toiling in the boat is over
[1:45:11] in one gospel account it says when he
[1:45:14] stepped in the boat they found
[1:45:15] themselves on the other side
[1:45:19] at some point
[1:45:22] at some point
[1:45:25] we're going to see him and recognize
[1:45:27] that he's stepping in the boat
[1:45:30] and we're suddenly on the other side
[1:45:33] and it'll all be over
[1:45:36] and he's going to come in an unexpected
[1:45:38] way
[1:45:39] he's going to come when nobody else can
[1:45:42] come i'm telling you friends
[1:45:46] in the final hours of our journey on
[1:45:48] this life he's going to come when nobody
[1:45:49] else can come
[1:45:51] and he's going to come in a way nobody
[1:45:53] else can come
[1:45:55] and that's the hour we got to remember
[1:45:57] the loaves and the fish
[1:45:59] if he's ever delivered you he can always
[1:46:01] deliver you
[1:46:03] if he's ever healed you he can always
[1:46:05] heal you
[1:46:06] don't be afraid don't let your heart be
[1:46:09] hardened amen remember the loaves and
[1:46:11] the fish
[1:46:12] tell one another about the loaves and
[1:46:14] the fish tell about your deliverance
[1:46:16] tell about your healing remind yourself
[1:46:18] of it write it down in the journal talk
[1:46:20] to your friends about it don't let your
[1:46:22] heart get hardened now because things
[1:46:23] are going to get worse
[1:46:26] but if he can break fish
[1:46:29] he can calm the storm
[1:46:31] and he can step in the boat
[1:46:33] and we can arrive and somehow find
[1:46:36] ourselves
[1:46:37] on the other side
[1:46:42] how did you get through that trial
[1:46:43] brother chad i don't know
[1:46:46] something unexpected happened in an
[1:46:48] unexpected way he came on the scene and
[1:46:51] i just found myself on the other side
[1:46:56] how did it happen there's no reasonable
[1:46:58] explanation for what happened god
[1:47:01] delivered me
[1:47:04] oh praise god friends this is the hour
[1:47:07] to have confidence in god
[1:47:10] don't forget the loaves of fish follow
[1:47:12] the pillar of fire because if the pillar
[1:47:14] fire leads you there he's got to provide
[1:47:16] for you there
[1:47:18] if he leads you to a trap he's got to
[1:47:20] get you through the trap
[1:47:22] if he leads you into trouble he's got to
[1:47:25] get you out of trouble just stay
[1:47:27] connected to the pillar of fire
[1:47:29] this holy ghost ministry that's placing
[1:47:32] us and leading us to take our land and
[1:47:34] then stick with it wherever he places
[1:47:36] you is where he'll provide for you
[1:47:38] wherever he places you is where he'll
[1:47:40] work with you
[1:47:41] don't lose confidence now and don't let
[1:47:43] your heart be hardened
[1:47:45] man let's all stand
[1:47:50] praise be to god
[1:47:53] musicians if you could come brother ben
[1:47:55] if you'd make your way up
[1:47:59] tell your friends
[1:48:01] i'm excited
[1:48:05] things are getting harder out there
[1:48:08] more difficult
[1:48:10] more uncertain
[1:48:12] i think you would agree things are
[1:48:13] getting more uncertain
[1:48:16] but something inside is becoming more
[1:48:18] certain than ever
[1:48:20] whatever is going on in the world is the
[1:48:22] opposite of what's happening inside of
[1:48:24] me
[1:48:25] the world's falling apart and i feel
[1:48:27] like something in me is coming together
[1:48:30] everybody's terrified that they have no
[1:48:32] protection from invisible forces
[1:48:34] but somehow i feel like i'm so protected
[1:48:40] god
[1:48:41] he's trained us friends we've watched
[1:48:44] we've watched the penalty for error
[1:48:46] we've suffered through the penalties for
[1:48:48] air ourselves
[1:48:50] so that we could learn how to just stand
[1:48:52] on his word and just take him out his
[1:48:53] word and just believe him
[1:48:56] stick with the holy ghost if the holy
[1:48:58] ghost leads you the holy ghost will take
[1:49:01] care of you all the way
[1:49:04] and if he led you into a trap
[1:49:06] then be happy you're in a trap
[1:49:10] if he led you to a job and all of a
[1:49:13] sudden it looks like that's the worst
[1:49:15] job ever
[1:49:17] at this time
[1:49:21] praise god you're in the right job
[1:49:25] if he led you to make a financial
[1:49:27] decision that now when everything is
[1:49:29] going in chaos and it looks like the
[1:49:30] worst financial decision you can make at
[1:49:32] a time like this praise god if he led
[1:49:34] you there then he'll take care of you
[1:49:36] there and you're going to watch
[1:49:37] something supernatural take place
[1:49:41] be confident in god
[1:49:44] be confident in your sonship with god
[1:49:47] don't let the circumstances in a carnal
[1:49:49] life cause us to back up when when if
[1:49:52] you ever said god led you to do
[1:49:54] something you better stick with it to
[1:49:55] the bitter end
[1:49:56] [Music]
[1:49:57] because one thing that frustrates me is
[1:49:59] when somebody feels led to do one thing
[1:50:01] one day and something totally different
[1:50:02] the next day
[1:50:04] don't make my god that fickle if god led
[1:50:06] you to do something stick with it to the
[1:50:08] bitter end when everything falls apart
[1:50:10] stick with it because if you're
[1:50:12] confident he led you here you're going
[1:50:13] to watch something supernatural take
[1:50:15] place and i wonder how many times we've
[1:50:17] bailed on god when he was just about to
[1:50:20] show up walking on the water
[1:50:23] because we looked with natural eyes at
[1:50:25] natural circumstances and did not know
[1:50:27] that there was a path in the water or
[1:50:29] there was a path on top of the water but
[1:50:31] either way god's got a path to get to me
[1:50:34] and deliver me out of this
[1:50:36] if you say god let me hear stick with it
[1:50:39] and tell you know for sure he's led you
[1:50:41] somewhere else but don't jump
[1:50:43] because it gets uncomfortable
[1:50:48] don't bail on your confession
[1:50:51] just because it gets a little scratchy
[1:50:53] [Applause]
[1:50:54] it's not the time to be wishy-washy
[1:50:57] about the leadership of god now it's
[1:50:59] time to be certain of the leadership of
[1:51:00] god and if you're willing to say god led
[1:51:02] me here then be willing to stick that
[1:51:05] out until you see god come walking on
[1:51:06] the water or god will supernaturally
[1:51:09] reveal to you another plan
[1:51:11] but don't let's not use our own minds
[1:51:15] and let's not be fickle about the
[1:51:17] leadership of the holy ghost but let's
[1:51:19] be certain of god
[1:51:21] and if you're not certain god led you
[1:51:23] don't say he led you
[1:51:27] just say i think this is the best
[1:51:28] approach
[1:51:30] because when you say i think this is the
[1:51:31] best approach nobody will blame you for
[1:51:33] thinking something different
[1:51:38] don't say god led me unless you know god
[1:51:41] led you
[1:51:43] because you hinder your own faith
[1:51:45] backing up on that
[1:51:47] but just say i feel like this is the
[1:51:48] right choice to make and i feel like
[1:51:50] this is what god wants me to do
[1:51:52] and then later when you change you say
[1:51:54] well i think i was wrong and every one
[1:51:56] of us will say praise god brother i've
[1:51:58] done that a thousand times
[1:52:02] but when you're certain you can say god
[1:52:04] i know god led me here then that's the
[1:52:06] place to stay
[1:52:10] we don't want to start becoming our own
[1:52:12] shepherds
[1:52:16] sometimes he leads you into the valley
[1:52:19] of the shadow of death
[1:52:22] but he'll not forsake you
[1:52:24] for i know thou art with me
[1:52:28] be sure of god
[1:52:31] sometimes
[1:52:32] we've got to reign ourselves in
[1:52:36] and force ourselves to stick with our
[1:52:38] confession
[1:52:41] and it may get pretty uncomfortable
[1:52:44] and you may have all kinds of doubts in
[1:52:46] your mind
[1:52:48] but sometimes you've got to go back
[1:52:50] to where you were when god led you to
[1:52:52] make that decision
[1:52:55] and i did it with all the understanding
[1:52:57] i had at that day and i was sure god
[1:52:59] told me to do that and you've got to
[1:53:01] remind yourself of that because all the
[1:53:03] circumstances will change
[1:53:06] and you're going to have to hold fast
[1:53:08] to see him come walking on the water
[1:53:12] this is not time for us to be children
[1:53:15] to toss out words with no meaning but
[1:53:18] it's time for us to mean what we say
[1:53:20] and say what we mean and stick with with
[1:53:22] what we say and if you're confident god
[1:53:25] led you and he did you stand fast
[1:53:27] because something supernatural take
[1:53:29] place
[1:53:30] and you're gonna have a testimony of how
[1:53:32] great god is
[1:53:35] don't forget the loaves and the fish
[1:53:36] friends
[1:53:38] let's just pray
[1:53:41] lord jesus we thank you father
[1:53:44] for all that you have done for us lord
[1:53:47] in this hour lord that we live
[1:53:50] it seems like there's nothing natural
[1:53:52] that is certain anymore
[1:53:54] things that seem so certain are falling
[1:53:56] apart
[1:53:58] seems like things that you used to be
[1:54:00] able to put confidence in you can't put
[1:54:03] confidence in anymore
[1:54:05] but lord there's one thing that's never
[1:54:07] changed
[1:54:08] that's your word
[1:54:09] [Music]
[1:54:11] lord you are the same yesterday
[1:54:14] today
[1:54:15] and forever
[1:54:17] and god we want as a body
[1:54:21] to remember the loaves and the fishes
[1:54:24] and we want to have the strength to
[1:54:25] stand firm in the face of all opposition
[1:54:29] knowing that you've placed us here in
[1:54:31] this hour
[1:54:33] and you've ordained us to be here in
[1:54:34] this time and in this boat
[1:54:37] and that you're going to show up and
[1:54:38] make a deliverance
[1:54:40] oh god i pray that you bless your
[1:54:42] children lord
[1:54:44] forgive us for our childishness
[1:54:47] forgive us for vain words lord forgive
[1:54:50] us for invoking your name and invoking
[1:54:53] your word invoking your will when it
[1:54:56] wasn't lord it was just our own ideas
[1:54:58] forgive us for that we repent for that
[1:54:59] lord
[1:55:01] but help us lord to be careful with our
[1:55:03] words
[1:55:05] and say what we really know to be true
[1:55:07] and believe and help us to stick with
[1:55:08] our confession
[1:55:10] until you bring us through
