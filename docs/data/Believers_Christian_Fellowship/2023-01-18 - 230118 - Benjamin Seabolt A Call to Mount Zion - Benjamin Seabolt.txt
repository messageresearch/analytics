again for this opportunity to gather together Lord we know that the days are numbered and the times are numbered that we'll have this opportunity Lord so while it is here we want to offer Thanksgiving for that we want to take full advantage of that Lord we just ask Lord that you would come tonight that you would accomplish that which you've purposed ordained this service to be Lord father normally we would maybe in the past ask that you would come in to help us Lord to help us to speak and to help us to hear father but the age is growing so dark and so deceiving and so treacherous Lord that we know that that won't even suffice anymore father so we would ask that you would come and be the speaker tonight father that you would come and be the hearer tonight Lord for we know that that's the only thing that will work and that will stand the test of time so we just commit ourselves to you Lord Jesus once again thankful for the opportunity to be here and to worship you with people of like Precious Faith Lord we just ask that you would have your way now in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you good to be with you tonight if you have your Bible will turn to Hebrews chapter 12. thank you musicians Hebrews chapter 12. and I have a thought that I would like to uh take a peck at I guess you would say because we're certainly not going to accomplish everything but I have this thought for sake of for the sake of a title we'll call it called to Mount Zion and there's just something that's open to me and I shared this with some of you that was over at Christmas and I've not made much Headway since then I'm still pretty much lost in the putting all the pieces together but I see enough to at least start putting a few pieces together and we'll just have to trust the Lord to do the rest and to put the rest together at the appropriate time whenever that may be but uh I'm not really prone to nervousness when I'm ministering or before people but this is something that I can kind of relate to our pastor on Sunday he was feeling that he couldn't put everything together that the way he wanted to and I said that's very very much the way that I'm feeling is just I I've seen the picture and the Lord had dropped it in my heart but I just to put it out into words and especially to explain it to some to where somebody else will see it I just don't know that I'm capable so if I go extra slow tonight or if you have me pausing for a little bit I'm okay I'm doing that on purpose I I don't want to start chasing a bunch of rabbit Trails on this I want to try to teach it more so but with his grace that's what we'll do so everything's fine if I just slow down a little bit um Hebrews 12 verse 1 says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God and let's skip down to verse 12 now wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that witch's Lane be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and Holiness which out without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fell of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one more soul of meat sold his Birthright for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the sound of Words which voice they heard not he's referring to Israel here which voice they heard not I'm sorry that they heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the father of the and the Church of the firstborn born which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word as you would take your seats so Paul is speaking here and he's saying that you are not called to the same thing that Israel was called to and he expounds on that by revealing that Israel was a nation and they were called to a natural Mountain they were called to everything being natural they were a natural people with a natural land we know at the end time they end with a natural number 144 000. so Paul is differentiating that that is not we what we as Gentiles are called to but he just doesn't leave that to our own interpretation he after tells us that we're not called to a natural mountain or a natural physical piece of ground to stand on he says you are called to Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels so you see he immediately starts delving into the spiritual world so we're not called to Natural things we're called to spiritual things and we know these principles to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel so in a nutshell he tells us you're not called as Israel was called you're not a natural people you're a spiritual people don't look at the carnal Natural Things focus on the spiritual things if I'm interpreting that correctly and we know that this is what brother random taught us um that the Jews were all natural people the Gentiles were spiritual people called for his namesake we know that brother Branham taught us that that was what God desired even before the Earth was created in the back part of his mind he wanted a spiritual Gentile bride he foreshadowed a lot of things through a natural bride a natural Church through Israel but in the back part of his mind he wanted that spiritual Gentile bride of his own choosing so I've had brother Franco put this up here this is the picture that blew up in my mind that I'm trying to put all the pieces together it's based off this 11 series of services here that brother Brandon preached and this was drawn to my attention uh brother Franco if you don't care to do with the lights what you did last time that would be really great thank you um this was drawn to my attention because as I was studying and reading this series there were some I don't even know what you would call them but there were comments that brother Branham would drop in as he's preaching this series that they just stuck with me and I couldn't shake them and one of them uh is a statement that he makes a few times during his ministry and he would make the comment when I would go out into these meetings I don't usually preach Doctrine when I go out there you know I respect the other men's pulpits I go out I preach something evangelistical something usually shallow or faith building something of that nature and I usually don't teach on deep things or doctrinal things and he's he made that a few times but in uh just prior to this series that he preached he's at Jeffersonville and he makes that same type of comment you'll forgive me for not having the quote I could not find it today um but I'm sure somebody will be able to find it and send it to me and when you do I'll give you a cash reward but it drives me nuts when I know it's there and cannot find it just because I can't put an apostrophe at the right place or you know how it goes but the thing that Drew my attention to it is when he made this comment he says I don't usually do those things I don't have any intentions of doing those things but then he followed that up with unless he tells me to do something and it just struck me with the tone of voice and the way he said it it was almost like he knew what was getting ready to happen and that it was going to be different than what he normally did um so it was almost if you would say like a warning um heads up I don't usually do and operate this way but something's changed and if he tells me to do something differently well then I'm going to do something differently and what he was getting at is he was basically respecting the other ministers that he would be preaching at churches he didn't want to step on their toes doctrinally and just tell things the way they are now we know there were times that brother Branham did that but as a general operating role he generally didn't do that if he was going to preach anything deep or doctrinally or teaching wise he came back to the Tabernacle and did that so he made that comment just prior to these services and it just stuck in my mind so when that was the first thing that happened and then the second thing that happened is as I was going through uh this series of services it became very apparent to me that he is clearly deviated away from his normal pattern because if you listen to these messages like he's not holding anything back it's very raw very direct um it's very straightforward so he kind of gave a warning to something and then he did it that was the second thing that caught my attention the third thing that caught my attention is as he's doing these services and I'll read some of these quotes here in just a second he starts predicting what he's going to preach next which is kind of unusual um but he'll come to one service and he'll announce the title and then he'll just he'll say well next service I'm going to preach this and in this particular situation he's in Louisiana and the next service is all the way in Arizona so um he's bouncing around a lot but yet he already has a mindset where he's going with this and we know the principle in the Bible and even brother Branham alludes to it that when a prophet is on the scene there are times in his life that um I'll say it this way that his life becomes the word to the people and the example is brother Branham gave us was we know there's prophets in the bible he had to go lay on his side for so many days to represent something there was one that had to um go marry a prostitute which obviously no good Prophet would ever do but God instructed them to do that so that their life could become the word to that people for a reason for a son and that is what at least to me appears happened during this course of services is his life we know everything in brother branham's life was not the word to the people um when he took two weeks off and went squirrel hunting and was you know being himself and whatever I'm not trying to spiritualize every aspect of the prophet's life but there were times during what he was foreordained of God to do his ministry that literally became the word to the people and was representing something and was speaking something so he comes 1965 on the wings of a snow white dove and I know I'm kind of jumping into this in the middle you would think I would start at the invisible Union and start explaining myself but that's just not the way this one's going to work I'm sorry it messes with my OCD as well I know but this I just have to kind of jump in whether it's open and then see what happens but on the wings of a snow white dove um brother Brian says now we want to get into the scriptures right away and I want you to turn with me to Psalms 55 and then also Matthew 3. and my subject tonight was brother Ernie's topic on this on the wings of a snow white dove that's what a brother had just sang he says now I won't be able to strike all of the notes in the scriptures that I got here because I'll just kind of skip over a few of them and because I promised the message so he's getting ready to read his opening scripture for on the wings of a snow white dove and then he just makes this statement the Lord willing for a human next Saturday I want to preach on the conditions for the Rapture if the Lord willing Psalms 55 give ear to my prayer O Lord so he tells the opening scripture he says this is where I'm going this is my topic all by the way next Saturday night I want to preach on the conditions for a Rapture Psalms 55 give ear to my prayer oh God hi not thyself for my supplication and maybe I'm maybe I'm just weird I don't know but like to me that don't fit like you have announced your topic for tonight you've said where your scripture is you should start reading your scripture but he does it he drops something in here and I'm just prone to believe that he's doing these things for a reason he's wanting somebody to catch something so he reads Psalms 55 give and this is important so we're going to read this give ear to my prayer oh God hide not thyself from my supplication attend unto me and hear me I mourn in my complaint and make a noise because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in Wrath they hate me my heart is sore pain Within Me and the terror of death are Fallen upon me fearless and tremblings come Cummings are come upon me the horror has overwhelmed me and I said all that I had wings like a dove for then I would fly away and be at rest Lo then would I wonder if far off and remain in the wilderness Selah he says Sila means amen so this opening scripture for on the wings of a snow white dove you can see that if there ever was time to have wings like a dove and fly away these are the conditions for it but if you had wings like a dove and Could Fly Away out of this condition what would that be to you would that not be a Rapture to you so now I put that back with the statement that he just said prior to reading this scripture and again I'm prone to believe he's trying to make me pick something up so he reads this scripture that if there's ever a time for a Rapture this is the conditions for a Rapture get me out of this condition but he preaches on the wings of a snow white dove paragraph 33 in that same message he says David a lover of the Wilderness when he got distressed and the people wouldn't believe him and the enemies had come upon him he said if I had the wings of a dove I would fly out into the Wilderness and they'll remain how many times have I thought the same thing so now he's interjecting himself into this same condition same thoughts and we know brother Branham had just dealt with this and he had to come to terms with it 1965 December 4th he comes to preach the rapture in the Book of Psalms now I want to read I want to speak on a real strange subject tonight just for a little while I got some scriptures wrote down here and I thought maybe that tonight I was going to speak on something different but he already said back in Louisiana that tonight he's speaking on the rapture so now it draws more attention to me to it to me because it tells me that this is not something that brother Branham maybe even is cognitively doing but God is making him do this he's seeing that this is the pattern and the way that it goes so I'm sure he had some type of intuition to it or he wouldn't have made that comment back in Louisiana but right before this service he said I thought I was going to speak on something else but the time got away and I didn't want to stay so long so I'm going to speak on this topic so now this is moving into position he says so I just turned over here and got some more scripture and I want to spray speak on the subject of that the Rapture now we believe that there will be a Rapture all Christians believe that that's Bible readers believe there will be a Rapture and now to read for some background we read the 27th Psalm verse 1 to 5. so listen to this now compare this to the scriptures that he just read in Louisiana the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wickedness even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fell though the host shall and Camp about me my heart shall not fear though War shall rise against me and this I will be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all of the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord until require in his Temple I believe that's supposed to be inquiring his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in the Pavilion and in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me He Shall Set me upon a rock so if you compare the scripture that he spoke on on the wings of a snow white dove David is in a horrible situation distressed complex wanting wings to fly away and now he's basically saying to his enemies and all of these people that are distressing him and all of these problems that he had Bring it on I don't care God will take care of me what happened what happened I would venture to say that something Supernatural arrived on the wings of a snow white dove and that raptured David out of his condition but if you read on the wings of a snow white dove brother Branham spends the majority of that message speaking about the health condition that he used to have and had all of his life and how he feared that and dreaded that and struggled with that and he was always looking for the seventh Dove that his mother had to dream about so he spends the majority of that dealing with a health issue that he had all of his life but how he had finally met that dove in Arizona and that how he knew now all of that was resolved same thing as David he was in a straight he was in a complex situation he didn't have the answers to he wanted out of it but he got his answer on the wings of a snow white dove so now he's relaying these events in his life that exactly matched the scripture that exactly matched the topics that he's dealing with that brings us to things that are to be his opening scripture John 14 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but my being now look at this portion of scripture John 14. I'm sorry take those three portions of scripture and compare them to Hebrews 12 that we just read Hebrews 12 1 wherefore seen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us lay aside every weight and the sin which so do with which doth so easily beset us the trouble this is trouble these are things that we have to deal with this is the same position David found himself in when he was crying out to the Lord but Paul doesn't leave us there verse two looking unto Jesus I would venture to say looking for something on the wings of a snow white dove the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sat down at the right hand of God and now skip down to verse 12. it says wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees wherefore lift up you have these problems but look unto Jesus on the wings of a snow white dove and now you come to verse 12 and it says lift up I would venture to say Rapture up Rapture up so this pattern starts jumping out to me that there is a consistent pattern through the scriptures through this series of message through brother random's life that he was expounding that there is a problem you receive the holy spirit that comes on the wings of a snow white dove and that will Rapture you up out of this situation wherefore lift up the hands which hang down in the feeble knees but it does it in there because remember we come down to verse 18. and Paul says for ye are not come unto the mount that may be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice that they heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much is a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with the door and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are come so you're not come to this but you are come to this these are things that you are come to these are things to be you have wings of a snow white dove that brings something that raptures you up out of a situation to reveal to you that you're not having to be stuck here you're you are come to something else that is to be you are coming to Mount Zion things that are to be and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels so this pattern that brother Branham ministers through the titles of these services this pattern that David found himself in this this situation that brother Branham found himself in this pattern lays in Hebrews 12. when Paul was speaking foreign things that are to be he says and last night speaking over in Yuma for the Christian businessman I spoke on the subject of the rapture now that might been a strange subject to speak among at a banquet but most everybody there was Christians and that's the way it is on these campaigns like this or in a church I could say how many of you as Christians probably every hand would go up you're a Christian and so if we're Christians I think we ought to be kindly notified ahead we don't have to just guess at it we're notified what our destination will be remember what he's preaching things that are to be and I want to speak on that tonight you want to speak on what tonight to kindly notify us of what's ahead what our destination is going to be I want to speak on that tonight and the subject is going to be things that are to be and now speaking last night on The Rapture so tonight I want to speak on this subject that I might tie it together with last night's message so I'm not just making it all up he's now tying them together he's saying what I'm going to speak tonight is directly tied to last night's message now there is going to be a rapture we know that that's in the future to be things that are to be now I'll tell you the fourth thing that Drew my attention to this whole thing and this was really what I guess kind of blew the doors open on all of this and it's not really proud to say it but I'm reading this message things that are to be and I don't know how many times that I've read it read it when I was a kid I've read it over and over but I'm halfway through this message things that are to be and it just strikes me like a lightning bolt Out of Heaven that brother Branham is preaching a message things that are to be and he has not mentioned one single simple carnal thing nothing maybe I'm just dense but it just didn't say I just didn't catch it before but I would think if you're in a prophetic realm and you come out and I'm going to tell you things that are to be in I guess just in my subconscious or in my preconceived idea somewhere I had it that he's going to come out and start expounding upon the future watch for this look for this prepare for an economic crash prepare for you understand what I'm saying prepare for things that are to be and I'm halfway through this message and I'm looking and I guess maybe subconsciously too I knew there was a spiritual element there but I guess I just already conceived in my mind he's going to expound upon things that are to be for me to prepare for and I just had that stuck naturally and halfway through I realized he's not spoke about one so I read through the rest of the message just with that sole intent of seeing does he ever bring up anything natural that is to be that I need to prepare for and the answer is no he does not so immediately I'm very curious because the next one is modern events that are made clear by prophecy once again in my preconceived hybrid mind I'm thinking modern events made clear by prophecy he's going to say well you all saw this on the news last week this is what it means I'm not so spiritual sometimes I'm sorry but again so I Breeze through this message and I realized he has not mentioned one single thing so he's came and preached two messages now things that are to be and modern events that are made clear by prophecy and not mentioned one carnal thing and that's when it struck me that I'd missed it I had missed the event that was unfolding I'd got a lot of the details in these messages and I believe them all and they're true and they're accurate and they're good but I had missed an event I had missed the big picture of what he was trying to accomplish in my opinion he comes to paragraph 24 and things that are to be he says now but he was telling them that after death there is life so he's speaking of Jesus talking to his disciples because I go and prepare a place that is to receive them shows that there he was speaking to them that there was life after this life is ended so obviously after I realized I've missed this this is nothing to do with carnal situations this is nothing to prepare for in an economic realm or a political realm or uh any other realm this is strictly a spiritual message then I start gleaning this for the things that he's speaking of and this was the first indication that I came to he says that there is life after this life so if there's life after this life would not that life be things that are to be so this fits the title now now maybe I'm starting to be spiritual I'm starting to catch some things he says there's life after this life that we go into and as you get older that becomes more of a reality to you as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close then it begins to you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event it is a continuing of this same life in another world in another place yes if we know the word of God we know where we're living we know the hour that we're living in we know what lays ahead we see what we've passed and the Book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ his work through the ages that was up to the Book of Revelation and then his promises that is to come so catch that and the Book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ his work through the ages that was up to the Book of Revelation and then his promises that is to come so if his work Through the Ages was up to the Book of Revelation what would the Book of Revelation be his promises that is yet to come or may I say things that are to be so brother random speaking here we know John wrote the Book of Revelation so at the time that the Book of Revelation was written it was things that are to be because it starts out in the church ages goes up into a Heavenly realm it goes to the Jews goes to the Millennium goes to New Heavens new Earth we understand that it's things that are to be now when we come on the Earth in our age we're like farther along than that but at the time it was written John well I'm just going to say what the scripture says Revelation 1 verse 17. and when I saw him this is John speaking and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last and I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen I have the keys of death hell and death write the things which thou Hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter or may I say things that are to be this is what the angel told John to write which makes perfect sense based on what brother Branham just told us because John is going to John had already as a scribe at the beginning of of the book as one of the four gospels he had already wrote the things that he had seen now we know in this situation he's on the Isle of Atmos he's cut up into a vision he's seeing things so there's there's two different occurrences here but he's telling him to write write the things that thou has seen and the things which are present tense in John's day and the things that shall be hereafter so this same pattern is the same pattern that the angel tells John Revelation 4 verse 1. after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither we know that's the rapture but what happens immediately after the Rapture and I will show thee things which must be hereafter or things that are to be which is exactly what happens here you have the Rapture on December 4th and you have things that are to be on December 5th so you can see where I'm drawing a conclusion that this is more than a man that there's something being orchestrated that God's doing something even though I cannot yet wrap my mind around it I still don't have the full picture I don't know I just know that God did something here and it matches the pattern in the scriptures and the the thing that we have got to catch at least in my opinion the thing that we are to catch here is if we'll walk through these script these titles I think we find our life in these titles because we all know and believe that we were somewhere else before we were here which is invisible to us there was once an invincible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't know how that was I don't know how many stages that has been in I do know that it started in his mind as his thoughts now from his thoughts till now is really fuzzy to me I've got a little snippet here and a little snippet there and I think I should see some things but it's really really fuzzy and I cannot preach it because it's just my opinion but that's where I started was in a union with my Christ but since that time I have had to come to this earth in a fallen condition and I have had to have Works express my faith remember what this what Jesus said that the true works of God was and that was to believe on he whom God had sent so since my separation from the union of Christ at least in his mind if not at other stages that I have no idea about at least in his mind and remember we don't take that trivial because we know his thoughts were real and literal so I'm not saying that flippantly like I thoroughly believe I was literally there even though I don't know what literally means I believe it was real and I believe I was there even if it was in his thoughts it was still real so that is where I started but I had to come and I had to work I had to express a work that would express my faith I had to do a work that would express my faith and that was that work was a scriptural work that work was to believe on whom God had sent for my age brother William Branham I cannot get to any other level until I first do that because if I try to get to another level without first doing the work of God which is to believe on him who he sent I will find myself in the third title trying to do God a service without it being his will but if I do do the works of God and I do believe on he whom he has sent I will now say I have heard but now I see and that will reveal to me God's only provided place of worship and when I find out God's only provided place of worship something comes down on the wings of a snow white dove the Holy Spirit the spirit of Truth Christ himself if I will believe on he whom he hath sent and I won't try to do it my own way and I will hear and I will see I will perceive I will understand he can reveal to me his only place of worship he will send me his holy spirit on the wings of his snow white dove and that will catch me up into a spiritual rapture I believe in a physical rapture like I said there's we can't go to seed on any of the statements that I'm making tonight because there's too many Avenues to try to tie them all up I'm not going to be able to do it just try to understand what I'm saying in the context that I'm saying that that will catch me up into a spiritual rapture into a spiritual condition I do not have to be fretting about all of my enemies gathered around me I don't have to worry about that God will fight for me I've done what he's told me to do I've believed on he whom he hath sent I've received his Spirit on the wings of a snow white dove I am caught up I am raptured but immediately after that what does God start doing with us he does what he did to John and he reveals let me get back to that scripture so that I say that say it right Revelation chapter 4 verse one you don't have to turn that I just wanted to get the scripture he does to us what he did to John come up hither he raptures us up and I will show the things which must be hereafter things that are to be he will reveal modern spiritual events he will make those clear by the prophecy that's going on I will have no trouble with that leadership and that will put me right back where I started at in an invisible Union and communion with God So This Is Us this is our course this is our life in this series of services now again I know there is probably literally thousands of details that I cannot see yet my brain can only handle so much I know I'm missing Lots here but this is what I see I hope it blesses you I hope you get something from it I hope it helps you I hope that you can see the scriptural pattern here and understand that this is something God orchestrated his services and we know that his Services were LED of the Lord and inspired we understand that we believe all that but we also know that there are certain times and points in his ministry that were if we would say cornerstones or uh I'll say it like he said it they're not just simple Evangelistic services or faith Building Services they are literally orchestrated by the lamb himself to bring us back into an invisible Union and communion with him his his life and his ministry at these points in time literally become the word being demonstrated to us I trust you believe that I I feel that you do I'm sure this is way deeper than we grasped at this point but this is just what I say so now I'm going to skip that now we're going to quickly I'm not going to hold you late tonight I'm just going to go as far as we as we can here but we're we're not going to cover all this tonight so just just relax we're not going to be here till midnight I promise I want to read some of these quotes and things that are to be to expound upon what I cut there paragraph 28 he says therefore we now we know that Jesus is going to prepare a place to receive a people unto himself whose those people are I hope it's we are a part of those people tonight if it isn't my friend God has made a way a condition that you can be included in that if you want you're on free moral agency you can act the way you wish to but now notice now in this world that is to come there is a world to come there are things to be spiritually there are things to be carnally we're not denying any of that I'm just here to say it doesn't matter it's going to burn we can get so spiritually minded we're no earthly good I get that but in this message and this is so significant because remember who we're talking about here this is the seventh angel this is the seventh vile Angel this is the vessel that the lamb is going to use for full Redemption to claim what is his and this is the tail end the closing moments of his ministry I'm convinced he's not out trying to have a prayer line at the end of his ministry for a reason like he he did have that but it wasn't his emphasis you understand what I'm saying like he's emphasizing deep spiritual doctrinal teachings in the not necessarily such friendly environments uh he went to Brother Jack Moore's and he said he had full Liberty there brother Jack told him preached whatever he wanted to preach but then he's going to these businessman conventions and I mean they're already mad at him because he preaches against the women with short hair I mean here he is trying to expound and preach upon the rapture but it's the closing moments and the closing opportunity God's trying to get this in not that God's trying to do anything you under you understand what I'm saying this is important there's a purpose behind it so he starts dropping these phrases in there is a world to come paragraph 32. now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God the there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there even even was a molecule I thought you were preaching about things that are to be but he's talking about a spiritual Gene your father's spiritual Gene even before there was anything what is he doing he's doing exactly what the angel did to John in the Book of Revelation he says write the things that thou has seen and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God now we just made a transition we're not past tense anymore and you are not you are you are present tense you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or daughter of God therefore you get what I mean you are now made present tense you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty to is is to express God to this nation and to this people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you ever have eternal life then it was always eternal life ah and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here present tense and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that the eternal life dwells in you dwells in you present tense what's he doing he's already wrote the things which were now he's speaking about the things that are exactly what the angel did to John paragraph 37 therefore the bride and the Rapture will come forth transition what's he doing you guessed it same thing the angel did to John in the Book of Revelation now he's speaking about things that aren't to be we know there is a spiritual Rapture now but there is to be a physical rapture and there therefore the bride and the Rapture will come forth and there is all pre-planned by God all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would set all about it it's all pre-planned by God God knew it would be here he made it that way so that when we get there he's going to prepare a place for us and when we get there it'll be prepared just like even this night is prepared like this hour is prepared yes his great foreknowledge tells him all of these things by foreknowledge I started laughing when I was studying this because it was exactly what Sunday was about are we here or are we there and brother Branham is doing the exact same thing he says because we're this way here we'll be that way there and because it's that way there will be that way here my question is how much difference in separation is there here but you'll notice in the first 37 paragraphs let me finish reading this and then I'll make a statement I don't hardly understand that how we could think that a God that could prepare all of these good things for us that we cannot put trust in him that if he brought us in this chaos that we're now in and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust him to prepare the things that is to come see the Eternal things so remember what he's preaching things that are to be but now we've got the understanding this is nothing carnal and he makes it clear for us these are things to be Eternal things I'm speaking of Eternal things I'm speaking of spiritual things catch what I'm speaking about he says paragraph 42 I believe that heaven is a real place just the same as this is a real place see for God started us in our spiritual growth in this place and I believe that heaven is a place just as real as real as this where we don't go up there and set for eternity and just sit there on a cloud we don't just strum our heart from all here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things we're going to do things things that are to be we're going to do things okay what are those things that are to be where we're going to do things we're going to live we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life to a real eternal life we're going to a heaven a paradise just like Adam and Eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed in the Garden of Eden before sin came in were on our road back there now what did the angel tell John to write things which shall be hereafter in 42 paragraphs he's done exactly what the angel told John to do I found this astounding now again I know I've jumped right in the middle of this I'm expounding upon things there are to be which is like number nine down the list I think but that's just where we're at so he lays in the first 42 paragraphs he does exactly what the angel did to John but then he starts expounding upon the scripture that he read let's go back and read that really quick foreign this is his opening scripture for things that are to be will Breeze through this just as quick as we can and then we're going to close because again I I know how we could just drag this out for hours and we're not going to do that John 14. the topic is things that are to be is opening scripture let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you if in my father's house are many mansions why does he still have to go and prepare them they're already there but this is Jesus speaking we know Jesus is not confused in my father's house are many mansions but I'll go prepare them I will go and prepare a place for you so if I already have a mansion over there they are there he said so in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you so I go to prepare a place for you so that tells me that when I get there there's something that he's prepared and is preparing besides my mansion besides a brick building a house a physical house for me to live in there is something being done to it should I say there is an active work involving it but it is there if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you to myself that where I am there may you be also and whether I go you know in the way you know Thomas saith in him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh to unto the father but by me so Jesus is saying in my father's house are many mansions but I have to go if you'll allow me just to use my own words here but I have to go do something besides that if that makes sense but there is something currently there in some form something eternal but just because something has an eternal attribute this is my understanding I could be wrong but just because something has an eternal attribute does not mean that it's a completed work it does not mean that it cannot be in another form or change forms because we know we had to be eternal even if it was in the thoughts of God but we now know that we're in this position but an eternal attribute is tied to us so the form has changed again starts getting really fuzzy when I try to explain that I can't explain that but we know that that's true because I'm no longer still just in the mind of God I'm expressed but there's still an eternal attribute brother Brandon taught us that is here with us we have we know that has to be fact and Jesus is saying the same thing that in my father's house are many mansions but I'm going to go prepare a place for you I believe when brother random starts into this message things that are to be he expounds upon this and gives us the proper understanding for this paragraph 45 he says Jesus is going to make ready are coming there tie that to what Jesus said he says the Mansions are already there brother says Jesus is going to make ready our coming there I just want to interject this and this is really carnal but hopefully it'll just help somebody it helps me if you buy a house you've got the deed for the house you have that house it is yours um let's say you paid cash for it the bank don't even have a lien on it like it's legitimately as much as can be in this Dimension yours you've bought that house it is there but there are things you have to do to a house before you move into it but it is there but you put Furniture in a new house you bought you maybe go and paint the walls inside there is a lot of things that happen inside of that even though it's already there and probably has been there for a long time Hope just hold that thought and hopefully that will help you it helped me Jesus has gone to make ready our coming now notice in my father's house there's many mansions or let us I don't mean to add to the word or take from it because we're not to do that but let me just make this as not an additive but just to bring out a point in my father's house is many kinds of mansions I don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just everybody look just exactly alike I don't believe that all will be blondes or brunettes or little or big or all Giants thought we were talking about houses I believe that God is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got planes he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it and he made the season summer winter spring autumn he made the seasons it shows he's a god of variety he made you in a variety some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom in my father's house are many mansions but brother random says he's going to make ready our coming there and then he starts talking about people instead of houses in my father's house are many kinds of mansions not all of them are blondes brunettes or little or big or all Giants look at Saint Peter and judge him by Andrew Andrew is that prayer award just stayed on his knees all the time and the Apostle Peter was one of those fibrant brands that preached and so forth and Paul was more scholarly like more like a prophet or something and set back and see Moses wrote he's differentiating between people Moses wrote the first four books of the Old which he wrote the Old Testament Testament the rest of it was the laws and kings and Psalms and so forth that someone wrote of the prophets but Moses wrote The Walls the first four books of the Bible Genesis Exodus Leviticus and Deuteronomy and then Paul wrote the New Testament he's still differentiating between between people that's true Matthew Mark Luke and John wrote the acts of what taken place and so forth but Paul separated law and Grace and put it in its place now notice many many mansions many kinds of mansions but he just spent three or four paragraphs talking about people and if this Earth that we live in today being so great as we love it and love to live and breathe the air and see the flowers and things if that if this is here in this expression remember the title of this service is things that are to be and this expression one that is dying is only expressing one that is eternal when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man here struggling to live somebody in a hospital or on a sick bed or in an accident struggling and the death rattle is in their throat and pulling and crying and screaming for Life what does that mean it means there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that there are things that are to be that doesn't do what things that are here present do now now they are temporal gifts to us these things only expressing that there is one that is in where it's the Eternal one that's what Jesus has going away to prepare what's he going to wait to prepare there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that now there are temporal gifts to us these things only expressing that there is one where it's an eternal one that's what Jesus has gone away to prepare the Eternal one for us now there's only now they only express there's a greater of the same kind because these are the same kind same kind of what bodies one's hybrid one's not but one is still expressing the other and Jesus has went to prepare many kinds of these houses that was paragraph 51 he comes to paragraph 52 he says now remember the Bible said if this Earthly Tabernacle of our dwelling if it perish or be dissolved we have one already waiting so now I know I'm not out in left field now I know I'm not crazy he is tying a direct correlation between mansions to bodies with the title of a message things that are to be so things that are to be is not the economic crash that's coming that we need to be concerned about what we need to be concerned about is that we don't get in the way of Jesus preparing a way for us in things that are to be that's what we have to focus on because we're a gentile people we're concerned with spiritual affairs spiritual things now remember the Bible said if this Earthly Tabernacle of our dwelling if it perish be dissolved we have one already waiting just as the little baby it's little muscles in the mother are twisting and turning and you notice you can take a woman if she's ever so foul foul but when she's to become a mother a little while before the baby is born there's a kindness about the woman get around her there's always something she's more tender why there's a little angel Spirit waiting to receive that natural body just as soon as it's born the Breath of Life comes into it and God breathes it in there and it becomes a living Soul now just as this baby is being born then the spiritual body is there to receive it and now when this baby is dropped here in this earth like the baby is dropped also there is an immortal body waiting to receive the but the spirit back into itself this Immortal body is things that are to be that Jesus is going to prepare oh what a great thing we are now in Jesus in Christ Jesus babies babes in Christ children of God waiting for the full Deliverance waiting for something to be at the coming of our Lord Jesus to receive us up into himself when the body this Mortal will take on immortality now we know that portion that he's referring to is not the spiritual Rapture that is the physical rapture the likeness all the things that he did expresses the things that are to come just as the body gives you here just as this body he gave you to live in only expressed that there is one that is greater yet to come so now it's becoming really abundantly clear what the topic things that are to be is about bodies that are to come he gave you one to live in only expresses that there is one that is greater yet to come see if we bear or have borne the image of the Earthly we also shall bear the image of the Heavenly which holds no evil in this one that is to come things that are to be now we find this life holds all kinds of evils so therefore the life that is in it that is to come won't have it this one has lust and sickness and death because what is it it's not the house that he's going to prepare this is so rich things this is so good this is a pest house referring to our flesh of the bodies how many knows what a pest house is sure well that's what you're living in a pest house is where they put all the diseased people well that's just what sin has done to us put us in an Earthly pest house they wouldn't let anyone else come into this pest house because there's all kinds of germs flying around in there and the people will take these germs and be six themselves and sin brought us into the devil's pest house the devil's body all but the other one is called my father's house what other one that Mansion over there with brick and mortar and transparent gold streets the other one the other body that I will take on when I drop this Earthly one that one is called my father's house I'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house amen there you are take you out of this old Earthly pest house he's going to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists paragraph 65. now this old world must fail but fall because it came through sex and it came through disobedience in the beginning and we was born here through sex through the fall and it must go right back the same way to the fall but the one he is now preparing for you cannot fall so he is currently preparing something for us but Jesus when he was on Earth says that the Mansions are already there again hybrid brain explosion but there has to be a simple explanation because God hides himself in simplicity so why is it so difficult to believe even though it has an eternal attribute and is there and was there and has always been there and Jesus declared in my father's house are many mansions that he's still not doing something and working on an attribute that is attached to that there's only one thing that the brother of random says that we take from this life to that one character you tell me how you perfect your character for that Mansion over there if Jesus didn't go and make a way to send you a prophet back to tell you the truth and establish your character and form it into the image that would fit that body it was over there I go way ahead of myself there but I just couldn't help myself we have an eternal attribute attached to us we have a mansion and a body I don't know what to call it Saints if you call it a theophany at this point like was the theophany in the mind of God and then it became into something else and then came down that I don't know I'm just being honest I don't know I know at the very least I was an attribute I was a thought and I was real in the mind of God and there is at some point in time going to come a bodily expression of that in another dimension that I'm going to take only my character and put into that and how all that works I have no idea I cannot expound that to you but Jesus has went to prepare a way for that to happen and the only way for my character to get to a point that it can go into that Dimension and into that form that already has an eternal attribute it's through the word that he has delivered through the prophet for my age the only way for me to get to things that are to be is to receive the things that are now and the things that are now has told me what has been what is and it's told me what's going to come to give me the faith to move into that next dimension if you'll get me just a couple more minutes I promise we'll close now this world skip it now what if we just had to stay in this kind of body aren't you glad there's such a thing as death now isn't that strange I'm glad that there's something to get us out of this pest house there's an open door and it's called death Jesus stands in that door amen he'll guide me over the river catch that Jesus stands in that door what's Jesus doing in that door like does he need to keep it open with his hand physically hold it he says Jesus stands in that door maybe he's preparing the way through that door it's called death Jesus stands in the door he'll guide me over the river he'll take me through the door he's there's a great door standing Yonder called death and every time your heart beats your one bit closer to it and someday I must come to that door you must come to that door but when I come there I don't want to be a coward I don't want to scream and back off I want to come to that door wrap myself in the Robes of his righteousness not mine his but this I know that I know him in the power of his resurrection that when he calls I'll come out from among the dead to be with him out of this pest house wherever this body might fall and wherever it might land whatever it is I'll come out someday because he promised it to me and we believe it yes sir he's making one that cannot fall making one what a house a building a body yes yes and Sunday the answer is yes the answer is yes now just in case you think I'm completely out in the left field and making all this up the scripture says that there has to let every word be established by two or three Witnesses 1963. the Third Exodus brother Branham says there's coming in Exodus where God will show who he is where the church itself the Bride of Jesus Christ will be Exodus out into the land that's promised starts quoting scripture in my father's house are many mansions in this place you don't have to go there and fight like they did speaking of Israel it's already prepared starts quoting another scripture if this Earthly Tabernacle dwelling be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where I am that where I am there ye will be also the great Exodus at hand so at the end of his ministry and things that are to be he's pounding this principle in and my father's house are many mansions and my father's Kingdom there are bodies that have an eternal quality that you are going to and he is preparing a way for you to get there but all the way back in 1963 brother Branham just touches on this extremely briefly in that message of in The Exodus out of here the Rapture out of here it's almost like he can't help this pattern it's a scriptural pattern he just Falls right into it he's talking about a Nexus he's talking about a bride going out here he's talking about a Rapture out of here he says in my father's house there are many mansions things that are to be and then he expounds upon it even there if this Earthly Tabernacle dwelling be dissolved we have one already waiting immediately even back in 1963 ties those mansions to bodies things that are to be if the musicians will come please so the spiritual principle that we can take from this is really really simple really really simple and brother Branham said it in the unveiling of God if we'll go ahead and stand together please and brother Chad if you'll come please and the unveiling of God he says see that was so great he's speaking of Israel and God coming down on the mount see that was so great till even the people said they said when they seen Jehovah come down in this Pillar of Fire and begin to shake the earth and the things he done in the Mountain of Fire And even if anybody tried to go to the mountain it perished they perished it was so great till even Moses feared the Quake then if that time he shook just the mountains this time he'll shake the heavens and earth what about this Glory he's speaking on the unveiling of God 1964. what about this Glory what about this unveiling of God if that was veiled by a natural Veil Moses was veiled by naturalville this is veiled by a spiritual Veil so don't try to look at the natural break into the spirit and see where you're at see what hour you're living in that's the principle that lays under things that are to be that God revealed to me it's not natural Saints we have natural lives I get that we don't want to become so spiritually minded that we're no earthly good I get that but the most important part as Gentile spiritual Gentile Brides is when a prophet comes on the scene and he says I'm going to preach on things that are to be don't think carnal because it's not carnal it's spiritual and it's eternal First Corinthians 2 12 says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghosts teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual things Gentiles do what compare spiritual things with spiritual things not carnal things first Peter 2 wherefore laying aside all malice and all GAO and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby and if so be ye and if so big ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious if so be Ye Ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious I'm sorry to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ gentile people spiritual house wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded this is First Peter 2 and it ties directly to our opening scripture go all the way back up here of Hebrews 12. of Paul speaking who said you don't come to a natural Mount you come to Mount Zion well in in Peter he just spoke that there's a Cornerstone in there in Zion directly tied together spiritual application for the Gentile bride the Cornerstone of Zion is obviously going to be where Zion is and that is what Paul said that he wants us to go to to compare spiritual things to spiritual things and I'm going to close with this if you'll go ahead and play something please Colossians 3 verse 1 if ye then be risen with Christ raptured seek those things which are above things that are to be where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affections on things that are above not on the Earth [Music] that's all I've got to say spiritual application not distracted by the carnal if the devil can keep us distracted by the carnal there is no way that we're going to find the door that we're going to be caught up that we're going to make feeble hands strong that we're going to make lame feet strong it's only through a spiritual word and the full Spirit of Christ that's been delivered to us that if we focus on that and I'm not preaching this in a condemning way I believe that's what you are focused on and what you do want to focus on I'm just saying for me when I came to that message and I'm reading it it exploded to me that at the tail end of his ministry this pattern through the scripture God and the prophet is so trying to impress upon us to not be distracted and to focus on the real reality the spiritual application of the word in our life can we say Amen let's pray together precious Lord Jesus we thank you once again for the time that we had here Lord we just pray that you would take the words that were spoken that you would let the people see my heart Lord and no doubt I've done a poor job trying to explain it and put it together Lord but we're still stuck in hybridization Lord and as our Pastor said Sunday we're still trying to take Precious Eternal wonderful things and Proclaim them through a fallen vessel with a limited language Lord and there's just no way to do it but Lord we know that you can do it because you said that if you would leave you would sin the comforter and the comforter would have the capability to teach us these things Lord so we Just Surrender ourselves to your ways and we just pray that your will be accomplished and was accomplished here tonight pray that you would bless this people I pray that you would give them good rest tonight Lord Jesus I pray that you would bless them in their work day tomorrow Lord I pray that you would just build a hedge of protection and about them Lord that you would just bless and all that is said and done and all that we do and that's where you leave this building Lord may we leave here not as just a carnal person Lord but may we leave here with a firm Revelation that we are an eternal being that we have representation in Heavenly places and may that Comfort us and make us strong we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you both Chad the longer I serve him the sweeter the longer I served him the sweet later he grows grows more that I love I love them or love he loved [Music] these days [Music] amen I'm so glad a prophet told us what's coming next not things we need to worry about on Earth but so much has already transpired for the bride what do we have to look forward to next things that are to be that's what's next on the agenda for us will there be things that happen in the Earth yes there'll be things that happen in the Earth but I like the next message after modern events made clear by prophecy is leadership I'm sitting in my seat thinking brother banham said in the message leadership he said when you started out in life there was a hand there to take you to lead you along there was mother and father he said if you grow old enough you'll you'll go out the same way at the end of life there'll be a strong hand that holds you and leads you alone and I thought all the way back to the beginning of Adam Adam had the leadership of God he had the hand of God with the word of God but he lost the leadership of God by taking his hand out of God's hand but at the end God is taking a bride who will slip her hand right back in his hand and whatever happens on the natural we have his leadership to take us all the way and the things that are to be so the natural things don't matter we have his leadership and we know where we're going we're not to worry about the things that are on Earth and I think it was communion I may be wrong but I think it was communion where brother Branham said it was such a wonderful day when I realized I wasn't the son of Charles and Ella Branham he had come at the end to a whole different identity I say may God who has showed us what's next on the horizon may he be our leader as we slip our hand how do you slip your hand into his come back to the word and surrender to the word and let him have leadership in our lives amen it's good to know where we're at man God bless you all let's sing Brother John I stand in all within the presence of the Lord by whom the Raging of
