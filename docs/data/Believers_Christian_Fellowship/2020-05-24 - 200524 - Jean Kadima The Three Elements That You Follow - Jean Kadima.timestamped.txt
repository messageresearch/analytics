[5:38] my wife's sister josie could not make it

[6:05] the body of christ

[6:11] our heart
[6:15] if you have decided
[6:18] to do so then you have
[6:21] something for someone
[6:24] for your children so once again we pray
[6:28] that you put us aside and just use us
[6:32] mightily
[6:33] with what you have in store
[6:36] for us for this day we commit everything
[6:39] to you
[6:40] in jesus christ's name amen
[6:45] thank you musicians
[6:48] we're going to go straight with the word
[6:54] genesis 37 by the franco
[6:58] if you can pull it thank you
[7:04] genesis
[7:07] 37 5
[7:11] as i was saying that god does not have
[7:14] to
[7:16] supernaturally tell you that you have to
[7:19] preach
[7:22] it doesn't have to do everything in with
[7:24] a supernatural sign
[7:26] it got just to be the word you're a
[7:29] preacher
[7:30] you're ready to preach right
[7:34] yeah i want to make sure that sometimes
[7:36] we have the wrong we can get the wrong
[7:38] impression that everything has to be
[7:42] uh supernatural signs
[7:46] no uh god as i say god does this for a
[7:49] purpose
[7:50] just to give us some courage god does
[7:53] not do anything for the show
[7:55] [Music]
[7:57] it's uh for a purpose and uh we thank
[8:00] him for that
[8:02] so we're reading uh
[8:07] genesis 37 5 and joseph
[8:12] dreamed a dream and he told
[8:16] it his brethren and they hated him
[8:19] yet the more and
[8:23] he said unto them here i pray you this
[8:26] dream which i have dreamed
[8:28] for behold we were binding sheaves
[8:32] in the field and lo my shift aroused
[8:35] arose and also stood upright
[8:39] and behold your sheaves stood round
[8:42] about
[8:42] and made of obeisance to my ship
[8:47] and his brethren say to him
[8:50] shall thou indeed reign over us and
[8:54] shalt thou
[8:54] indeed have dominion over us and they
[8:57] hated him
[8:58] yet the more for this dream and for his
[9:02] words
[9:03] and he dreamed yet another dream and
[9:06] told it
[9:06] his brethren and say behold i have
[9:09] dreamed a dream
[9:11] more and behold the sun and the moon and
[9:13] the
[9:14] eleven stars made of obeisance
[9:18] to me and he told it to his father and
[9:21] to his
[9:22] brethren and his father rebuked him and
[9:25] said
[9:25] unto him what is this dream that thou
[9:29] has
[9:29] dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy
[9:33] brethren indeed come to bow down
[9:37] ourselves to thee to the earth
[9:40] and his brethren envied him but his
[9:44] father observe
[9:45] the same amen may god bless
[9:49] the reading of the word you may take
[9:51] your seats
[9:58] are we ready for the word
[10:01] now um
[10:05] i want to talk i want to continue
[10:08] what i started before this old
[10:11] corona virus hit
[10:15] i was talking about what was in the
[10:17] silence
[10:19] but god keeps changing it so you cannot
[10:22] be
[10:23] really ready with the message you're
[10:25] preaching until that day
[10:27] arrive you can change it many many times
[10:32] until that they arrive and people start
[10:35] praying about the service and
[10:38] as they start praying and god starts
[10:41] changing things
[10:43] so um that's why i
[10:47] will title it not what is in silence but
[10:51] i'm going to talk about the three
[10:54] element
[10:55] that you follow
[10:58] but abram talks about that uh here i
[11:01] wrote
[11:02] that follow you is all the same
[11:05] there are three elements that brother
[11:07] benham talks about
[11:09] that follow you and uh that's what we
[11:12] want to talk
[11:14] again full
[11:18] disclaimer i am
[11:22] exploring this if another preacher comes
[11:26] he may
[11:26] look at it in different angle
[11:30] but it's i pray that to be an edifying
[11:34] and he stays with the world
[11:39] now this is when barabanam talks about
[11:43] it
[11:44] in the message the ark you say now
[11:48] there's three elements that people live
[11:51] in not just follow you or you follow
[11:55] them but you live in
[11:57] first is the humanistic second
[12:00] is divine revelation and third
[12:04] is vision now this like in prayer when
[12:08] you pray for anyone in
[12:12] humanistic we say well
[12:15] i hope you get well i'm hoping
[12:19] i'm believing with you trying to use all
[12:22] the faith i can
[12:23] that's human now
[12:29] second is divine revelation when
[12:32] something is
[12:33] revealed to you you just know in your
[12:37] heart
[12:37] it's going to happen yet with nothing
[12:40] but just the revelation
[12:44] and third is a vision
[12:47] of course that's that saves the lord
[12:50] that's perfectly positive now
[12:54] it entered up into this rim here
[12:57] and something just said to me you're
[13:00] going to have
[13:01] a boy and you will call his name joseph
[13:05] so you know the story brother branham
[13:08] was
[13:09] um reading about the story of
[13:12] joseph just like we read
[13:16] and he started praying in his closet and
[13:20] and telling god how he appreciate that
[13:23] he had
[13:23] we had a man like joseph a man like us
[13:28] how could such a man exist and he
[13:31] cried to look into his life
[13:34] and he says something
[13:38] say to him that you're going to have
[13:41] joseph you say it was not the audible
[13:44] voice
[13:45] but it was internal voice
[13:49] it was something of the
[13:52] faith realm is it not it was not a
[13:56] vision it was not the audible voice but
[13:59] it was just something that tells you
[14:02] you're going to have a
[14:05] child a boy and you're going to give him
[14:09] the name of joseph
[14:11] so the prophet is trying is showing us
[14:15] that there are three
[14:16] elements first you see
[14:20] him you know reading his bible
[14:23] and praying then enjoying the life of
[14:27] joseph maybe saying
[14:30] just for the drama that oh if i had a
[14:34] boy
[14:34] i'll give him a name the name of joseph
[14:38] and then a voice say to him not a voice
[14:43] something down there say that you're
[14:46] going to have
[14:46] joseph and he hold on to that
[14:50] promise and then
[14:54] one day the promise was fulfilled
[14:59] and one day the promise was fulfilling
[15:03] they say that uh
[15:05] it started in a human level where you
[15:08] just thinking about something desire
[15:12] something hope for something and then
[15:16] god takes your hope and your hopes your
[15:20] desire
[15:22] according to god's words and god says
[15:25] i'm going to give it to you
[15:27] and you hold into it you hold on it
[15:30] and god makes it happen
[15:33] and those are the three
[15:38] elements
[15:40] now the prophets say that
[15:44] they follow or you follow them or they
[15:47] dwell
[15:48] in you in other words
[15:52] all of us there is an element
[15:55] that we follow three elements
[15:58] we follow them from where
[16:02] so we must have followed them from where
[16:04] we come from
[16:05] [Music]
[16:07] so we can see it but when i'm talking
[16:10] about it here
[16:11] in melchizedek the great prince
[16:16] and king he said there's
[16:19] three elements that a man follows
[16:24] i'm pretty sure it is a believer fat
[16:29] the three there is a three element that
[16:31] a man follows
[16:32] first is humanistic second is divine
[16:36] revelation
[16:37] third is a vision it's thus safe the
[16:40] lord
[16:41] many times we are down in here we are
[16:44] in the human realm
[16:48] and never claim into this
[16:51] in the revelation if you you are not
[16:54] down in there cast your hopes through
[16:57] the veil
[16:58] up here to the safe the road though
[17:02] you don't see the vision though the
[17:04] vision doesn't come
[17:06] though when you pray for you say i i
[17:09] just
[17:10] wish i could believe that doesn't make
[17:12] any difference
[17:13] cause you ain't go down there call it
[17:16] so anyhow so basically
[17:19] saying that continue confessing it
[17:22] continue believing it until it
[17:26] you get from the human desire
[17:29] hopes and to a revelation
[17:34] amen and
[17:37] brother brahm says that okay
[17:41] so those are the three elements and
[17:44] you and i have them
[17:47] it doesn't say four element it's a tree
[17:51] okay now i say that for purpose
[17:55] because when uh on the human realm
[17:59] you know you have the desire the hope
[18:03] and then god uh anointed that
[18:07] desire or the hope into a revelation and
[18:11] in into a faith
[18:14] then come the vision
[18:17] where god said that saith the lord
[18:20] you're gonna get it
[18:21] and then you get it if i say it that way
[18:24] that will be four steps four
[18:28] element all right
[18:31] hope faith and then
[18:35] vision and the thing happen
[18:40] but he doesn't say that he say there are
[18:42] only three
[18:43] all right not four and he say that
[18:47] all of us have them but i can tell you
[18:51] that
[18:51] some of us will never see a little
[18:55] vision is that right no one
[18:59] not everyone will see it but yet the
[19:02] prophet says that
[19:04] we all have this and it follows us
[19:08] that's why it needs us to explore it
[19:12] all right it's uh
[19:16] we have the right to explore every
[19:19] portion of the world that god gave us
[19:23] that's why i'm taking the courage this
[19:25] morning to explore it
[19:27] it's there amen why do you go to high
[19:31] mountain
[19:32] hiking because the mountains are there
[19:37] good answer
[19:43] not everyone sees visions
[19:47] so we have the right to explore don't we
[19:50] have the right to
[19:52] explore the land the land has been given
[19:55] to us
[19:56] it's a promised land is the promised
[19:59] word of
[20:00] god is given to us can we go explore
[20:04] or are we going to be afraid at all
[20:07] of their giants in the land
[20:12] so we gotta go and explore by god's
[20:15] grace
[20:17] we can see something you remember
[20:21] brother branham prophecy that was given
[20:24] in french
[20:27] you know when god wants to compliment
[20:29] his prophet
[20:31] you know i love english you know
[20:35] but god spoke in french
[20:38] i'm just saying that's what he did
[20:45] brother you're bragging
[20:49] but god is god of diversity you know
[20:53] god understands all the languages
[20:56] it goes beyond languages
[21:00] he can uh he can even listen to what we
[21:05] did not say
[21:08] did not the the angel told brother
[21:11] abraham the very first thing that the
[21:12] angel told what branham said was
[21:15] go tell men their thoughts are speaking
[21:18] louder than
[21:20] what they're saying is that right
[21:24] yes but god was good he just
[21:27] decided to put it in french so we know
[21:30] god
[21:30] knows french he knows all the language
[21:34] he knows our pain he knows when we try
[21:37] to pray we cannot even pray
[21:40] he understands he goes he
[21:43] he knows the past the present the future
[21:47] you are in a good hands you have
[21:50] somebody to talk to
[21:53] amen you can stay assured
[21:57] that he cares the problem the prophet
[22:00] says
[22:01] is do we care that's the problem
[22:08] so this is what he said
[22:12] because of this momentous decision that
[22:15] you made
[22:16] william branham you were not forced to
[22:19] do it
[22:20] but you made this decision he said
[22:23] a huge portion of heaven awaits
[22:27] thee now but i'm saying that
[22:30] uh heaven now in paradox he said now
[22:33] that's what i wondered when i die
[22:36] will it be then i happen to think heaven
[22:40] is not portioned off uh different
[22:43] to different portions to us up there
[22:46] heaven is the kingdom of heaven that's
[22:49] within us
[22:50] one with us why do i say that you're
[22:53] gonna see
[22:55] i'm talking about exploring right now
[22:59] okay but i'm saying the heaven is not
[23:02] like portions small portions here and
[23:04] there
[23:05] then he in christ the mystery of god
[23:09] revealed then he say
[23:10] then our headship is a kingdom the
[23:14] kingdom of god
[23:15] is within you what is
[23:18] what is heaven the kingdom of god is
[23:21] within
[23:22] you say the bible jesus
[23:25] the kingdom we are not a denomination we
[23:28] belong to a kingdom and the kingdom
[23:30] is the word of god made spirit and life
[23:34] in our
[23:35] own life bringing to pass every promise
[23:38] in this day
[23:39] as it did in the day when the world and
[23:42] god
[23:43] was one and the word and god is
[23:47] one in his church today
[23:52] there you are so i was
[23:56] i want to say that i want to take that
[23:59] french prophecy to show you that we have
[24:03] the right
[24:04] to explore because god
[24:07] said to the prophet he has a huge
[24:10] portion
[24:11] and we it turns out that huge portion is
[24:14] the word made
[24:15] manifest and we can go
[24:18] and explore it and keep exploring it
[24:21] and that's to remind me one thing that i
[24:24] uh
[24:25] read uh in the message uh
[24:29] no it it not where
[24:32] um brother jr jackson had a dream
[24:36] or a vision in that vision he sees
[24:39] brother branham
[24:41] as a soldier with a great authority
[24:45] like a ranger and
[24:49] he sees brother branham and barabam
[24:51] calls him three times
[24:53] and brother branham had a big
[24:56] horse a real pube
[25:00] breed of horse and
[25:04] he mount on it and he took
[25:07] reins and went to heaven
[25:13] and then a smaller a smaller let's
[25:16] read it in know it it not
[25:21] and he say just a minute i look around
[25:23] and here come a horse
[25:25] smaller than that one and the same breed
[25:28] but
[25:29] smaller and students say i walked around
[25:32] and say he must have sent this back
[25:36] for me so this is what a junior jackson
[25:39] is saying that brother brennan must have
[25:41] sent
[25:42] this smaller same breed
[25:46] of horse for him
[25:48] [Applause]
[25:49] he uh he must have sent it or say
[25:53] i got it in a junior has
[25:56] done a little writing too so it takes
[25:59] that
[26:00] horse in does a little writing in heaven
[26:04] he say you know how you uh
[26:07] your saddle fits you brother branham
[26:10] the stirrups and everything say i
[26:13] thought well
[26:14] this fits me just right so i pull up
[26:18] on the reins of through the skies and
[26:21] say
[26:21] i pull on the reins and stopped
[26:25] him turn him around and went back
[26:28] see i went back and say i stopped the
[26:31] horse
[26:33] got off talked to the wife the horse
[26:36] was gone i don't know
[26:40] who what a genie jackson represent
[26:44] in that dream
[26:47] but uh if i was in that dream
[26:51] i wish that
[26:54] he did not stop
[26:57] and get out of the horse
[27:01] but continue to explore
[27:05] heaven because that horse was not just a
[27:08] horse that
[27:09] walks around but he has to go to heaven
[27:12] a huge portion has been given to
[27:16] us to explore
[27:19] and i don't see how again i don't know
[27:23] it was a vision or a dream whoa
[27:26] rep brother daniel jackson represents
[27:30] but i don't want to be that person
[27:33] where i'm giving this horse to go
[27:36] and explore and see the marvelous things
[27:39] of god
[27:41] and i just go a little bit a little ride
[27:46] then i come back
[27:49] and then i go talk to the system
[27:52] oh i go talk to the wife the church
[27:56] do i have the time to go doing that
[27:59] when the prophet told me follow me come
[28:03] and explore with me it's a huge portion
[28:08] that's waiting for us to explore
[28:12] oh this gives us a courage to keep going
[28:15] to explore all those things we know
[28:18] we will not we will not
[28:23] go outside of the framework
[28:26] of the world as we are exploring
[28:29] we know where our bolts are
[28:32] all our nuts are we know where we stand
[28:37] amen we we can we
[28:40] we still in the we we have
[28:44] our boundaries our boundaries are the
[28:47] message of the hour we will stay there
[28:50] and when you look at what we
[28:51] say somewhere down there
[28:55] is still the word but i'm saying
[28:59] when it's if it comes from the lord
[29:04] it must be the word or the continuation
[29:07] of the same word amen i want to stay
[29:11] there
[29:12] so i take all this to just a show that
[29:15] is good when we see something
[29:17] maybe the lord put it in our heart we
[29:20] need to explore it
[29:22] we have to have this liberty and that's
[29:25] what this
[29:26] church allows us because we have that
[29:29] liberty
[29:30] and the people are mature enough to
[29:33] follow
[29:34] to understand why we disclaim what we
[29:36] disclaim
[29:38] but we gotta still go into it because
[29:40] there's some
[29:41] blessing just to know it may be just a
[29:44] little
[29:45] something but it can't help
[29:48] i don't wanna leave my horse down there
[29:52] and go talk this is not the
[29:55] time of churchianity this is not a time
[29:59] of the system
[30:01] this is the time to explore
[30:04] and i want to explore by god
[30:08] grace
[30:14] oh my
[30:18] i see something that i put here
[30:22] let me just talk a little bit about this
[30:26] brother branham never seen
[30:30] a vision for joseph
[30:34] so that's why i'm taking this brother
[30:37] but i've never seen
[30:39] a vision about joseph so that's why this
[30:43] is for every christian these three
[30:46] elements are for every
[30:48] christian and the way buddha banham got
[30:50] it
[30:51] was not like okay he's a
[30:54] is a a prophet
[30:58] he was in human
[31:01] realm desire
[31:05] praising god for what he
[31:08] a man he made was joseph
[31:11] right then receiving the revelation
[31:16] then receiving the vision no brother
[31:19] branham
[31:19] never received a vision when it comes to
[31:24] joseph then is teaching us about the
[31:26] three elements
[31:28] so what happened to him was you know the
[31:31] story
[31:32] is when he received it
[31:35] and when the time came for joseph to be
[31:39] born god did not even tell him
[31:45] uh god did not give him a vision he just
[31:48] told him
[31:49] go to back to your book go back to your
[31:53] work
[31:54] that was it there was no vision
[31:57] so that's why we need to understand this
[32:00] one this vision i'm not teaching but
[32:03] just something that i
[32:04] saw and i want to share
[32:20] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[32:22] and forever
[32:23] as i said there's three elements that
[32:26] people dwell in
[32:27] the first one is humanistic we
[32:30] down here we say well i will pray for
[32:33] that person
[32:34] i'm hoping that now they'll get
[32:37] well now next is divine revelation
[32:40] that's
[32:41] when something down in your heart
[32:43] anchors it
[32:44] and say it's going to happen
[32:48] then something is going to happen
[32:52] then the third element is a vision
[32:55] or the word of the lord made
[32:58] manifest when you see that it's thus
[33:01] saith the lord
[33:03] now can we have we noticed something
[33:07] the way but abanam defined the vision
[33:12] in this uh example
[33:16] is the word of the lord
[33:19] manifested that's the vision therefore
[33:22] everyone can have it
[33:24] you don't have to be a prophet to have
[33:27] it
[33:27] so there are really three elements
[33:30] that follows you that you follow
[33:34] yes you have a play
[33:38] a part to play in the humanistic
[33:42] level you receive the divine revelation
[33:46] about who
[33:46] christ is then what happened
[33:50] is the word that you have received
[33:54] is manifested
[33:59] have you are you with me so is if his
[34:02] vision is the vision that god had
[34:04] about you and
[34:07] that's why i look at this i say it
[34:10] applies everywhere
[34:14] you were born you were like you were
[34:18] born you were a woman
[34:21] then you become a mad a mother
[34:24] a mother as a mother you gave
[34:27] birth to children that's what you did in
[34:31] a humanistic
[34:33] use the word humanistic you understand
[34:36] human realm
[34:41] you raise children that's why you
[34:44] doing in your human realm
[34:49] then god revealed to you the word
[34:52] you believe it and then comes the
[34:55] vision you live
[35:00] the word of god that has been revealed
[35:04] to you
[35:05] it becomes manifest because that's what
[35:09] the
[35:09] vision it does because today
[35:12] if the pro a prophet tells you
[35:16] that uh by 4
[35:20] by 4 45 you're going to receive
[35:23] 20 it's over
[35:28] is that right so if we say you're going
[35:31] to receive
[35:31] 20 by 5 o'clock it's over
[35:35] you have it you can already go
[35:38] on the internet and order a pizza
[35:42] because it's over so you don't have to
[35:45] wait it's there
[35:47] because when the prophet says something
[35:50] you can
[35:51] and he said that says the lord you can
[35:54] go take it to the bank
[35:56] there are vision is not
[35:59] another step but it is
[36:02] that word made flesh
[36:06] okay so if if the
[36:10] vision is that word mad flesh
[36:13] that is not another step with so
[36:17] vision is the supernatural
[36:20] things be blending
[36:23] with the natural if god called you
[36:27] and giving the revelation you are a
[36:29] child of god
[36:31] then one time the
[36:34] the uh the supernatural one time
[36:39] what god it was had in his mind
[36:42] will be manifested openly
[36:46] you start to manifest christ in your
[36:49] life
[36:52] amen
[37:00] so as you can see now
[37:05] whatever is saying that we read it
[37:09] then something is going to happen the
[37:11] third
[37:12] element is the vision or the word of the
[37:15] lord
[37:15] made a manifesto manifest
[37:19] what this tells us is this that you
[37:22] you did not come here let me just put it
[37:25] you did not come here by luck
[37:30] you no one can take your place
[37:34] you have a role to play
[37:37] in this world this gives you
[37:41] security give give you assurance
[37:46] that you have a role because these three
[37:49] elements
[37:50] are following you in this
[37:54] life you cannot even die
[37:57] before fulfilling this
[38:01] in your life they are wrong to play they
[38:04] are
[38:04] something that god has in his mind for
[38:07] you
[38:08] you can't and no one else is
[38:11] qualified explain to us
[38:15] well let me tell you that brother
[38:16] branham made sometime a mistake
[38:19] of going to a place when god gave him
[38:23] a vision and he goes there
[38:26] he starts praying for the child without
[38:29] that
[38:29] old woman to be present
[38:33] is that right to be present in the room
[38:36] and having a glass
[38:38] and cleaning up her glass she was
[38:41] very important in the vision
[38:44] without her the vision will not take
[38:48] place
[38:49] without you playing your role your part
[38:53] the word of god cannot take place
[38:56] or what god had in his mind he
[39:00] waits for you to be in position
[39:05] he wait for the bride to be in position
[39:09] before anything can take place
[39:13] i'm just going ahead the way even though
[39:15] i have a power presentation that's the
[39:17] problem with power presentation
[39:20] so you go uh you see it had to be
[39:24] william branham he had to be born the
[39:27] way he was born
[39:29] before revealing the seals it has to be
[39:33] in
[39:33] west it has to be in the sunset
[39:37] mountain it has to be that day otherwise
[39:42] it won't take place
[39:44] therefore you playing part
[39:48] this morning even this morning you had
[39:51] to be where you are now
[39:53] you have to be here for something to
[39:56] take place
[39:58] so without you god cannot do
[40:01] anything and sometimes
[40:05] we just delay what god had is in mine
[40:10] is that right what happened to that
[40:14] child was
[40:14] the child had polio the child was really
[40:17] dying
[40:19] they and the brother branham just god
[40:21] showed him that
[40:22] he's gonna pray for that child but he he
[40:25] went
[40:26] without looking at everything
[40:29] and when he picked up that child his
[40:32] situation
[40:33] became worse so guess what he did
[40:37] he just delayed he just
[40:41] delayed the healing but the healing took
[40:44] place anyway
[40:45] but he delayed it and sometimes we delay
[40:48] the plan of god because we are not in
[40:51] our position
[40:53] and without us without that woman who
[40:56] had to come
[40:59] and and sit down or start
[41:03] cleaning her glasses eyeglasses
[41:07] god could not do anything as soon as
[41:11] everyone was in place then the holy
[41:14] ghost came
[41:16] now how can the devil tell you that you
[41:18] are
[41:19] worthless that there's nothing good with
[41:23] you
[41:24] that i mean what do you have
[41:27] no you're playing a role this woman what
[41:30] did
[41:30] she do what did she do to help
[41:34] the prayer what did she do but
[41:37] without her nothing could happen
[41:42] so you are important in god's plan
[41:46] without you god is not complete we know
[41:49] that
[41:53] but since you are here the
[41:56] vision is fulfilled
[42:00] the supernatural what god had in his
[42:03] mind and the natural you
[42:06] are blending together amen
[42:12] and sometimes vision happens in phases
[42:16] right small pieces here small pieces
[42:19] there
[42:20] this person comes and sit over there
[42:23] this person comes
[42:24] and does this we sit on this chair
[42:28] and it comes like that it's what
[42:32] the supernatural is becoming
[42:35] little by little flesh
[42:39] pieces are falling into place
[42:43] amen oh what a wonderful lord
[42:46] we serve this supernatural the natural
[42:49] blends together that's what you are
[42:52] that's what we are ah
[42:56] the spiritual realm have become
[43:00] a flesh yes
[43:03] amen god help me
[43:06] keep us now
[43:10] as i was saying there was
[43:13] no literal vision on uh
[43:17] regarding but uh uh regarding
[43:20] brother branham um desire
[43:23] or um praying for
[43:28] how joseph and how great the man
[43:32] was there was no little
[43:35] vision and that
[43:39] explain as i was saying that explains
[43:42] that this vision is actually the word
[43:45] made flesh
[43:47] now i want to
[43:50] switch a little bit here and say
[43:55] when you you had hope
[43:58] in your human realm
[44:02] then god gives your hope
[44:05] a anchor and become divine
[44:08] revelation
[44:12] and then god said to you that something
[44:17] but it turned out between the time
[44:21] god revealed to you something
[44:24] and the time where it becomes
[44:28] flesh there is a silence
[44:32] it's always almost always like that
[44:37] god say something you believe it
[44:41] then there is a silence and it happened
[44:45] to brother branham
[44:46] god spoke to him a divine revelation
[44:53] and then there was a silence four years
[44:56] later
[44:57] a child is born i don't know how long it
[44:59] was
[45:00] that child is a girl
[45:05] what happened i believe you
[45:08] you say i'm gonna have a son but god did
[45:12] not say when
[45:14] there is a silence remember what we're
[45:17] saying the other day
[45:18] was like a silence does not mean there
[45:22] is no activity
[45:24] silent doesn't mean god is not
[45:27] present silent is just a silence
[45:32] is the time god gives to you
[45:36] to see where you stand it's a
[45:40] time that god maybe the devil
[45:43] has some rights and he goes to god and
[45:47] say
[45:47] you made things too easy for him
[45:52] so if i know you are a righteous god
[45:56] give me some time i want to do something
[46:00] and check this fate and that's why
[46:03] is there is always silence
[46:07] between the time where something is
[46:10] revealed to you
[46:12] and when he has to become flesh
[46:18] god help us to actually
[46:22] to know these things to receive the
[46:26] revelation of these things because
[46:28] they always happen it's uh
[46:33] some of us will spend years and years
[46:37] praying over something praying
[46:40] crying praying ears and
[46:43] ears out believing
[46:47] confessing but yet god seems to be
[46:51] silent
[46:53] and what do you do about it but abraham
[46:55] said be certain of god
[46:57] at that time because that's the
[47:00] it looks like a pattern because somebody
[47:03] laughed at butterburner and say did you
[47:06] mean josephine
[47:07] he said no no i said joseph
[47:12] and you will go through those things
[47:14] where people will mock
[47:16] will say all kind of things but that's
[47:19] the way it works
[47:20] right yes
[47:31] so after joseph promised there was a
[47:34] silence
[47:37] there was a silence for sarah and
[47:41] abraham so let's look a little bit about
[47:45] the silence of
[47:46] joseph after
[47:49] joseph told the story that we just read
[47:54] when he told his parents his siblings
[47:58] that it will this
[48:01] the vision about the shift
[48:04] the vision about the uh
[48:08] the moon the star and
[48:12] the 11 stars and the moon
[48:15] and the sun bowing to him
[48:19] after he told them that story
[48:22] there was a silence
[48:26] is that right and
[48:30] for the family of joseph
[48:33] where is joseph where
[48:37] is what he say
[48:41] what is he is it silence
[48:44] but silence is not a lack of
[48:47] activity there was a big
[48:51] activity that was taking place actually
[48:55] silence during that silence he was sold
[48:59] he went to egypt and he learned
[49:02] to know the living god
[49:05] and during the silence what happened is
[49:08] he
[49:09] get something major was taking place
[49:13] during the silence during the silence
[49:16] he get married to a
[49:19] uh a giant bride
[49:23] and so during the silence of the seventh
[49:28] seal
[49:30] during the silence of the seventh seal
[49:34] there is something major taking place
[49:39] a marriage is taking place between
[49:42] christ and the bride is the coming
[49:47] of christ in the bride so silence
[49:51] was good for joseph it was much better
[49:54] than
[49:55] joseph becoming the number two
[49:59] in egypt this was more important
[50:03] because something was taking place and
[50:06] marriage was taking place
[50:10] so therefore sometimes when we see there
[50:12] is a silence
[50:13] in our lives we don't understand what is
[50:16] going on
[50:17] that silence is good for us if we look
[50:20] closely god is doing something
[50:24] in that silence
[50:29] is that right
[50:32] genesis chapter 18.
[50:53] genesis 18 9
[51:04] and they say unto him
[51:09] where is sarah thy wife
[51:12] and he say behold in the tent
[51:15] and he say i will certainly return unto
[51:18] thee according to the time of life
[51:21] and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son
[51:24] and sarah heard it in the tent door
[51:28] which was behind him now abram and sarah
[51:32] were old
[51:34] and wealth stricken in age and
[51:37] it ceased to be with sarah after the man
[51:40] of women now
[51:44] we know the story we know what's taking
[51:46] place but i just want you to
[51:49] to notice
[51:52] there is a silence in the bible
[51:57] when god give this promise
[52:00] to abram and sarah that they're going to
[52:03] have a son
[52:05] and as i say silence doesn't mean
[52:08] lack of activity doesn't mean god forgot
[52:14] silence is just a silence god keeps
[52:18] silence as
[52:19] sometimes as a secret he has a secret
[52:23] that is happening
[52:24] something is happening and he takes a
[52:27] prophet
[52:28] to go where nothing is written and tell
[52:31] us what
[52:32] is not written
[52:35] and the prophet goes into it and say
[52:38] during the promise
[52:41] that abraham received
[52:45] between that time and when we see isaac
[52:50] something took place
[52:55] this is the promise i'm going to come to
[52:58] you
[52:58] abraham and sarah your wife will have a
[53:01] child
[53:03] then what silence so what what happened
[53:06] during that time no we just see uh sarah
[53:09] now has
[53:10] isaac it took the prophet to go
[53:14] into the silence and tell us that at
[53:17] that time
[53:18] after that visitation
[53:21] the body of sarah and abraham was
[53:24] transformed there was a body change
[53:29] amen so what was important
[53:34] i mean the body change
[53:38] during the time of silence is not what
[53:41] is happening
[53:42] this time that god
[53:45] is preparing his church for the body
[53:48] change
[53:49] but the body change is only through the
[53:52] revelation of
[53:53] what actually is the rapture
[53:59] amen i'm going to take a lot of
[54:03] few more examples
[54:12] i see the uh
[54:15] these three elements everywhere i look
[54:18] in your calling why do you do the job
[54:21] that you do
[54:25] well it's something in a humanistic
[54:28] level
[54:29] you know you know why do you live
[54:33] where you live why you come to the
[54:36] this church there is something
[54:39] predestinated
[54:41] it's very important that we realize that
[54:46] that uh you know so that we will not be
[54:49] going you know just doing things
[54:54] just the way we feel like we got to do
[54:56] them
[54:57] let me read something hopefully i wrote
[55:00] it down i told you about my notes right
[55:04] all right
[55:07] i think it's john 21.
[55:24] john 21 i think um
[55:29] let's go to verse
[55:32] 18.
[55:37] this is jesus speaking to peter
[55:42] he say this
[55:45] verily verily i say unto thee when thou
[55:49] wast yang thou gildeth
[55:52] thy seph and walketh o way there
[55:56] thou buddhas but when thou shalt be
[56:00] owed thou shalt stretch forth thy hand
[56:04] and another shall guilt thee
[56:06] and carry thee wither thou
[56:09] would not this speak his signifying by
[56:13] what death
[56:14] he should glorify god but i look at this
[56:18] it's not it's also showing that
[56:23] peter had a lot of liberty before
[56:27] i mean human liberty before the holy
[56:30] ghost comes
[56:32] it could go wherever you want ah
[56:35] it could go to anything you want
[56:40] but when he became old when you receive
[56:43] the holy ghost
[56:46] then every little step he need help
[56:50] any little step you want to know if what
[56:52] he's doing
[56:53] is right because we understand that
[56:56] every thing
[56:58] that we do you know we understand that
[57:01] god has
[57:02] called us to play a certain role
[57:06] therefore we need to make sure it's
[57:09] always
[57:09] him that even do a
[57:13] movie move from my house sell my house
[57:16] and going to
[57:17] a different house you got to be a
[57:20] leadership of god
[57:22] at least praying about it and say god
[57:25] guide me because we see that
[57:30] the vision in the vision you have to be
[57:33] where you supposed to be today
[57:37] we so much we say well i am an american
[57:40] i can go to any church i want to
[57:43] well you are more than an american
[57:46] you are a child of god you know you
[57:49] cannot say that
[57:50] you cannot say i just go because god has
[57:54] a predestined church where you have to
[57:57] be
[57:58] to be under certain ministry
[58:02] it's hard to sometimes people don't want
[58:04] to say this but it's
[58:06] true you know and everything has to be
[58:09] in place
[58:10] for the vision to happen but
[58:14] but yet we just decided ah i'm an
[58:17] american
[58:18] like this woman when brother brennan was
[58:20] preaching she said
[58:22] as an american we have
[58:25] the right to to to smoke cigarettes
[58:28] and wear shorts
[58:32] but i don't have that right
[58:36] no i gave to god my free moral agency
[58:41] i told him whatever you want me lord
[58:44] that's what i want to be so therefore he
[58:47] has to guide
[58:48] my steps because i have a role to play
[58:54] we saw that god plays role
[58:57] make people play role in history
[59:01] of humanity in history of the world
[59:04] we learn that acts the book of acts
[59:08] never close it keeps going and you are
[59:12] part of it
[59:13] if another book was written it'd be

[1:02:14] say wow that if somebody has
[1:02:17] questions about the the bride coming of
[1:02:21] christ give him this book this message
[1:02:27] it was not just a message
[1:02:31] it was a declaration
[1:02:34] well it was 1962
[1:02:39] brother branham had to make a
[1:02:42] declaration
[1:02:43] it caused for a special meeting it tells
[1:02:46] people it's going to take time
[1:02:48] and if you listen to it he was
[1:02:52] making a big statement declaring to the
[1:02:55] world
[1:02:55] standing on 1962
[1:02:59] and say right now all the
[1:03:02] seeds have been planted and god will
[1:03:05] honor the right seed
[1:03:08] god will the the the
[1:03:12] church that has
[1:03:15] the right seed will birth
[1:03:19] christ
[1:03:23] are you with me that's what happened
[1:03:25] 1963
[1:03:26] you see christ being birthed
[1:03:30] that's it oh am i the only one
[1:03:36] i i need to fill the pool right
[1:03:42] anyway
[1:03:44] and when i look i gather my children
[1:03:46] around and
[1:03:48] my wife my children around and i i
[1:03:51] i just just telling them i say you
[1:03:54] cannot have the holy ghost
[1:03:56] without the right seed
[1:04:00] you can have the seed pentecostal seed
[1:04:03] you can have denominational seed
[1:04:05] whatever
[1:04:06] but you get to really have the holy
[1:04:09] ghost
[1:04:10] you have to have the right seed
[1:04:15] wow you know these things but
[1:04:19] for me was just mind blowing if i can
[1:04:22] say that
[1:04:28] have the holy ghost where you may have
[1:04:30] the holy ghost but on
[1:04:31] what that holy ghost sits
[1:04:35] is sitting what what message
[1:04:39] what world thank god for the pure
[1:04:44] word of god the fullness of the word
[1:04:46] that has been revealed to us in this
[1:04:48] time
[1:04:50] thank god that we've taken position for
[1:04:52] it
[1:04:53] no matter what boycott whatever in your
[1:04:56] life don't ma don't
[1:05:00] don't mind that it happens
[1:05:05] oh my oh o
[1:05:11] well god is so good
[1:05:15] and i come to church and i heal ah wow
[1:05:18] my goodness the uh oh my
[1:05:22] how the word with the chronology
[1:05:28] oh i used to tell people without really
[1:05:31] putting together like that
[1:05:32] i used to tell people that you know the
[1:05:35] seventh
[1:05:36] seal came before the first
[1:05:40] seal the second seal the third why did
[1:05:43] not not to put it together
[1:05:44] but that was wonderful you know
[1:05:48] because i say well the seventh seal
[1:05:52] no the first seal cannot be opened
[1:05:55] without christ coming first
[1:05:58] therefore the seventh seal came
[1:06:01] before the first the second the third
[1:06:04] the fourth and
[1:06:05] fifth the sixth hallelujah christ
[1:06:08] himself had to open that seal
[1:06:13] so what is this order that we learn
[1:06:16] who is
[1:06:20] god has a perfect order in this this
[1:06:22] disorder
[1:06:25] seemingly it is old but is a perfect
[1:06:28] order just
[1:06:29] like one time i had my desk with all
[1:06:32] kind of paper and
[1:06:34] everything there and maybe somebody
[1:06:36] asked me oh
[1:06:37] what is this i said there is a perfect
[1:06:40] order in this disorder
[1:06:45] yeah god does things like that
[1:06:49] that's how he hides the secret
[1:06:53] because every army has to have its
[1:06:55] secret
[1:06:56] it makes things scramble when when brah
[1:06:59] chad was talking about how
[1:07:01] how a preacher will have hard time to
[1:07:04] preach something god get to him very
[1:07:08] clear clean and it comes to his mind
[1:07:12] because he's a human being he has
[1:07:14] because
[1:07:15] to qualify to preach you have to be a
[1:07:17] human
[1:07:20] and you have to have flaws
[1:07:23] otherwise you not qualify now you take
[1:07:26] it you don't know how to say it
[1:07:28] and i was thinking all these computer
[1:07:31] people like
[1:07:32] jiraiya you understand like the scramble
[1:07:35] the data
[1:07:36] you know there are scramble so that
[1:07:39] nobody will pick up in that network
[1:07:44] you understand i'm all i have only one
[1:07:46] believer when they send me today
[1:07:54] it's in even the work we do
[1:07:59] look moses in a humanistic
[1:08:02] he was a liberator oh my
[1:08:05] uh you see my typo there
[1:08:09] he was a liberator but he was not divine
[1:08:13] he actually killed a uh
[1:08:16] an egyptians right he killed an egyptian
[1:08:20] in human love
[1:08:24] is that right but it was called when he
[1:08:27] received the revelation the pillar of
[1:08:29] fire
[1:08:31] then what was in his mind
[1:08:34] god has placed that desire to be the
[1:08:37] liberator
[1:08:38] of israel when he got the pillow fight
[1:08:42] then he went to liberate
[1:08:46] the children of israel with a stick on
[1:08:49] his hand
[1:08:53] amen what about david
[1:08:56] in the humanistic he was a shepherd boy
[1:09:00] then simon came and anointed him
[1:09:05] any in vision meaning in the
[1:09:09] in where the supernatural and the
[1:09:12] natural blind
[1:09:13] blinds in the time of manifestation what
[1:09:17] did he manifest
[1:09:18] a shepherd again for israel
[1:09:23] yes
[1:09:27] sister middle used to tell brother
[1:09:29] branham
[1:09:30] i don't have anything you know
[1:09:34] i don't have anything i don't have any
[1:09:36] vision i don't speak in tongues and
[1:09:39] oh you have a lot
[1:09:42] do you know in a human rim
[1:09:45] sister media was uh
[1:09:48] taking care of the children of the
[1:09:50] prophet
[1:09:53] right at maybe 12 years old
[1:09:57] she received the revelation
[1:10:01] she was one of the people that closed
[1:10:03] their eyes when barbara say close your
[1:10:05] eyes
[1:10:06] when the voice came from heaven when he
[1:10:09] was baptizing
[1:10:11] she closed her eyes and
[1:10:14] she heard the voice that say i sent
[1:10:17] you as john the baptist who was saying
[1:10:21] she heard it she got the revelation
[1:10:26] and then in to play a role
[1:10:29] when the uh the supernatural this
[1:10:33] supernatural becomes flesh
[1:10:36] what was she
[1:10:39] a prophet wife what was her role
[1:10:43] again taking care of the children of the
[1:10:46] prophet
[1:10:47] high on his shirts and stand
[1:10:51] between people and
[1:10:54] him people all want
[1:10:57] his time his time
[1:11:01] they took even advantage of it uh we
[1:11:04] have to be honest right
[1:11:06] yeah but she has to stand
[1:11:10] to protect him her hair become gray yet
[1:11:14] she's saying what do i have
[1:11:18] how many people feel the same way how
[1:11:21] many people feel like they are worthless
[1:11:24] there's nothing good going on for them
[1:11:28] and look at these people look at that
[1:11:30] one look at this family
[1:11:31] look at this one they do look how the
[1:11:34] blessed they are
[1:11:35] they have the pictures on facebook
[1:11:43] right but yet
[1:11:48] there is no small role
[1:11:53] and you must be there
[1:11:56] before something happens
[1:11:59] you are important play your role just
[1:12:04] make sure god search me
[1:12:08] if there is anything in my life i want
[1:12:10] you to get it out
[1:12:12] i want to be where you want me to be
[1:12:15] play i want to be positionedly placed
[1:12:20] in where the word
[1:12:24] the way that was preached placed me
[1:12:35] it has to be the cry of our heart
[1:12:39] if you truly realize
[1:12:43] that things that we see
[1:12:46] news that we hear events
[1:12:50] all the things are not just by luck
[1:12:52] something is taking place
[1:12:54] and you have a role to play i want to be
[1:12:58] the right place i should not
[1:13:01] wait for tomorrow
[1:13:05] israel was supposed to be
[1:13:09] in a certain position
[1:13:13] they were supposed to be in the land
[1:13:16] after four days they
[1:13:19] delay the things
[1:13:23] and they spend 40 years
[1:13:26] instead of just a few days to get to the
[1:13:28] promised land
[1:13:30] we don't want to go in circle
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:33] we don't want to delay the lord
[1:13:36] because without us he cannot move on
[1:13:40] but we have to be willing we have to
[1:13:43] accept it
[1:13:44] but yet we delay him
[1:13:48] many ways
[1:13:53] if we can come out of this place saying
[1:13:56] lord
[1:13:57] i say it sincerely
[1:14:01] mold me change me
[1:14:06] search me the position you want me in
[1:14:10] that's where i want to be
[1:14:12] no matter what brother branham put it
[1:14:14] very bluntly
[1:14:17] blindly say that if god wants me
[1:14:20] to be a doormat that's where i want to
[1:14:24] be
[1:14:25] that's a very powerful statement
[1:14:29] you know why you say that because he has
[1:14:31] the revelation
[1:14:32] that whatever position god gives you
[1:14:35] is the best position because he knows
[1:14:38] the past the present and the future
[1:14:41] he knows exactly and he gives to his
[1:14:43] children their best
[1:14:50] i want to play my role until the lord
[1:14:53] say
[1:14:53] is enough and i have to accept it's
[1:14:56] enough
[1:14:57] it's enough if he says enough
[1:15:00] it's enough i have to be happy because
[1:15:05] god said so therefore there is a
[1:15:08] blessing behind it
[1:15:27] i i'm doing well
[1:15:32] with time
[1:15:35] you a mother you receive the time
[1:15:39] the word of your time
[1:15:42] you manifest christ in your your season
[1:15:47] that's your calling when the bride of
[1:15:50] christ
[1:15:51] you have a role to play
[1:15:56] just like brother branham did you have a
[1:15:59] role to play
[1:16:02] there will be a lot of things
[1:16:05] that may take place
[1:16:09] but
[1:16:15] it's all good
[1:16:21] you see i give all this example you hope
[1:16:24] one day to go home
[1:16:27] because of the hope you live a
[1:16:28] sanctified life
[1:16:32] and then rapture is revealed to you
[1:16:36] you accept the revelation then the
[1:16:39] vision is actually
[1:16:41] the body change you go home
[1:16:45] it's all over the place
[1:16:48] is a role you must play in
[1:16:53] the role you must play in the history of
[1:16:55] this world
[1:16:57] and anything that you do
[1:17:00] god still remember
[1:17:09] i remember story i wrote it down here
[1:17:14] 1954 1962
[1:17:20] brother branham in 1954
[1:17:25] he decided to take side with
[1:17:29] jesus and start preaching
[1:17:33] the tough things
[1:17:36] he used to preach about the divine
[1:17:38] healing
[1:17:40] salvation things that uh power
[1:17:44] of healing things that people
[1:17:48] can you know agree upon
[1:17:52] that at the end of 1954
[1:17:57] it felt like this is the time i need to
[1:18:00] tell the people
[1:18:00] the truth because their denominations
[1:18:03] are not
[1:18:04] telling them the truth
[1:18:08] so he made that decision knowing
[1:18:12] what that will cost him but he went
[1:18:15] ahead
[1:18:16] anyway for eight years
[1:18:20] there was god never talked about it
[1:18:24] eight years later he sees a vision or a
[1:18:27] dream
[1:18:28] a man who looks like his father
[1:18:32] is building a woman that looked like
[1:18:35] his mother and it turned out
[1:18:39] the denomination that
[1:18:43] beating the church when
[1:18:46] she want to rise up and explore
[1:18:51] a promised a beta
[1:18:57] and baraban was afraid because he saw
[1:18:59] the denomination the system is so big
[1:19:02] i'm just a simple man seventh grade
[1:19:07] what can i do against the big systems
[1:19:11] they're all together they're gonna
[1:19:13] boycott me
[1:19:16] but because of the suffering of the
[1:19:19] bride
[1:19:20] he stood and he said you cannot treat
[1:19:24] her like that
[1:19:26] and when once he did it his muscle
[1:19:29] become big
[1:19:32] and the man look at his muscles and get
[1:19:36] afraid and god show him
[1:19:39] eight years later the position you're
[1:19:43] taking for the word of god
[1:19:44] is not lost god is saying this
[1:19:49] that you taking position for him
[1:19:53] it will bless you amen
[1:19:58] brother branham in that year 1962
[1:20:03] god said to him that the never failing
[1:20:06] presence of god will be with you
[1:20:11] do anything oh some come and say
[1:20:14] go anywhere do anything
[1:20:18] because the never failing presence of
[1:20:20] god
[1:20:21] is with you when god says something like
[1:20:25] that you
[1:20:26] think the whole the
[1:20:29] all the trials are over
[1:20:34] no we gotta be more spiritual than that
[1:20:38] when god says to you that i'll be with
[1:20:41] you
[1:20:42] there is a chance that you're gonna go
[1:20:44] through tough
[1:20:45] that's why he said it yeah that's why he
[1:20:49] said it
[1:20:51] the never failing presence of god will
[1:20:53] be with you
[1:20:54] 1962. do you know what happened in that
[1:20:57] time
[1:20:58] his friends abandoned him
[1:21:03] the state the the state of my ministry
[1:21:06] something like that you know
[1:21:09] where he explained how people abandoned
[1:21:12] him
[1:21:15] you know 1962 he almost
[1:21:19] died because that
[1:21:23] gun he had purchased was not the right
[1:21:27] gun it was not a just right it was not
[1:21:29] the original
[1:21:32] and he almost blew his face
[1:21:38] i you know it was a time of
[1:21:41] great try after god say that never fell
[1:21:44] in presence of god is with you
[1:21:55] wow i remember reading
[1:21:58] he preached about the pressure let it go
[1:22:01] the pressure
[1:22:02] even even his associate pastor by the
[1:22:06] navel
[1:22:06] went through tough time and you got to
[1:22:09] read it between
[1:22:10] line to see it you say never
[1:22:13] is not sick but
[1:22:16] not too well i had to go cover for him
[1:22:20] and pray for the sick in the hospital
[1:22:25] but it was a promise that
[1:22:28] things will be great things were
[1:22:31] great because
[1:22:34] this is the time it declared
[1:22:39] the seed has been planted
[1:22:47] 1963
[1:22:49] the opening of the seas christ
[1:22:52] comes it was
[1:22:55] great years 1962 not
[1:22:59] in the flesh you are christian you know
[1:23:04] sometimes it's so hard that you cannot
[1:23:06] see in front of you
[1:23:08] you don't understand what is going on
[1:23:11] but yet the never failing presence of
[1:23:14] god
[1:23:15] is with you
[1:23:18] ignore the reasoning
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:22] take faith that's how it works no vision
[1:23:35] will be fulfilled without you
[1:23:42] amen you are very important in god's
[1:23:46] economy
[1:23:52] this gives us security that's what he's
[1:23:55] supposed to give to us
[1:23:57] there is no envy there is no jealousy it
[1:24:02] is
[1:24:02] just a joy that god knows
[1:24:06] he knows my name he has a plan for me
[1:24:10] i gotta play play that part i cannot
[1:24:13] even die
[1:24:15] until that is fulfilled
[1:24:20] and god is not complete his vision is
[1:24:23] not complete
[1:24:24] without my presence therefore he makes
[1:24:28] me
[1:24:29] become sanctified i want to be in that
[1:24:32] position
[1:24:33] god help me help me
[1:24:37] you know things will happen
[1:24:41] what can i do about them
[1:24:46] i don't have anything to do about that
[1:24:50] the never failing presence of god is
[1:24:53] with me
[1:24:54] so for us preachers it will be
[1:24:58] you know you taking that position
[1:25:02] you preaching that fullness of the
[1:25:05] message
[1:25:06] you keep talking about that bride
[1:25:10] the coming of the lord and the bride
[1:25:14] we won't give you our pulpit it's okay
[1:25:20] right it's okay because that's what he
[1:25:23] says
[1:25:25] he saying we are going to in the message
[1:25:27] reaction to
[1:25:28] an action he said we are going to the
[1:25:31] grocery
[1:25:32] a few weeks ago and we noticed a woman
[1:25:35] with a dress on
[1:25:37] it was the common the most uncommon
[1:25:39] thing
[1:25:40] we've seen in a long time see me there
[1:25:43] said to me
[1:25:44] she said bill what is the matter i say
[1:25:48] honey is what it is we don't
[1:25:51] want to get a accustomed to the world
[1:25:56] she said well some people have said
[1:25:59] we've got
[1:25:59] letters you're going to ruin your
[1:26:01] ministry by making such remarks as you
[1:26:04] do
[1:26:05] i say if preaching the truth wins a
[1:26:08] ministry then
[1:26:09] it ought to be ruined
[1:26:16] god has not called us to bash
[1:26:19] this to complain and
[1:26:23] but we still have to tell each other to
[1:26:26] take position
[1:26:27] anyway we still have to encourage each
[1:26:30] each other that by taking this position
[1:26:34] we are in a position that god gave us
[1:26:36] therefore we are allowing him to do what
[1:26:39] he has in his mind
[1:26:41] we have to encourage each other and uh
[1:26:45] i i have to do my part
[1:26:48] if you allow me yes
[1:26:54] do you believe it
[1:26:58] let's let's stand i've been doing very
[1:27:01] very well
[1:27:02] today let's stand and musician can come
[1:27:27] yes the bride has to be in the position
[1:27:30] that god has given to her
[1:27:34] because she has to declare things
[1:27:38] when i hear the messages that are being
[1:27:41] preached
[1:27:41] it's like the bride is declaring
[1:27:44] something
[1:27:45] that is not just brother branham who had
[1:27:48] to declare things
[1:27:50] that the bride is declaring things
[1:27:54] because the germ of life is in the body
[1:27:59] the gem of life is in the body without
[1:28:02] the body
[1:28:03] the thing will not take place
[1:28:06] therefore we may declare
[1:28:09] things what we say well
[1:28:12] we don't just have to look at what uh
[1:28:16] you know brother branham in history that
[1:28:19] was his
[1:28:20] message that was his ministry
[1:28:24] you and i have our ministry that we may
[1:28:28] declare
[1:28:29] things that will take place
[1:28:32] and it's written that we have that
[1:28:35] position
[1:28:36] but if we don't take it we delaying god
[1:28:45] god help us help me not to delay you
[1:28:50] all right help me to accept where you
[1:28:54] want me to be
[1:28:58] spiritually speaking help me
[1:29:02] search when we say to the lord
[1:29:05] search maybe the only thing that missing
[1:29:08] is
[1:29:09] i am being sincere because when god
[1:29:13] searches he finds things
[1:29:17] and then he comes with it do
[1:29:20] are we going to heed to those things
[1:29:23] that's the point
[1:29:24] but it's very important church
[1:29:28] the time of system is over
[1:29:32] the bride is rising up
[1:29:36] and she has something wrong she's
[1:29:39] playing
[1:29:40] right now all of us together
[1:29:44] there is no small one everything has to
[1:29:47] be
[1:29:47] in place like in a vision before the
[1:29:50] child
[1:29:51] can be healed
[1:29:55] amen it turns out when when everything
[1:29:58] is in place but abandoned
[1:30:00] feels some presence
[1:30:03] before that it doesn't feel anything
[1:30:07] once the everything is in position
[1:30:11] he starts feeling he knows the angel of
[1:30:13] the lord is there
[1:30:16] and god can do what he has in his mind
[1:30:21] when we are in position help us
[1:30:25] the word we hear day in day out is so
[1:30:28] powerful
[1:30:30] is the pure word of god amen
[1:30:33] he has the power to transform
[1:30:37] to mode to change to make
[1:30:40] us new creatures in christ jesus
[1:30:44] amen do you agree with me

[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:04] let's sing another
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:18] is
[1:37:21] the testimony of the lord is sure
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:28] making wise the simple
[1:37:34] more to be desired
[1:38:00] praise the lord we want the word to put
[1:38:03] us in position
[1:38:04] and the word has told us our position
[1:38:07] and we each one have a place
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:10] and i want to be in that place but i
[1:38:13] also want you to be in your place
[1:38:15] because if you're not in your place and
[1:38:16] i'm not in my place nothing's happening
[1:38:19] so we need to encourage one another like
[1:38:21] brother brother kadima was saying
[1:38:23] encourage one another because we all
[1:38:24] must find our place and hold that place
[1:38:27] amen so that the vision can come into
[1:38:29] manifestation
[1:38:31] so things can happen remember the
[1:38:34] silence and the story that brother
[1:38:36] brenham told about the
[1:38:38] washer woman and the and the owner of
[1:38:41] the ranch's son who comes to find a
[1:38:43] bride
[1:38:44] and he speaks to her privately without
[1:38:46] everybody by knowing it but
[1:38:47] there was a private revelation he gave
[1:38:49] just to her
[1:38:51] and then he leaves amen and now
[1:38:54] she's got to get in position because
[1:38:56] she's supposed to be ready on a certain
[1:38:58] day because he said on a certain day
[1:39:00] she's got to take the promise that he
[1:39:02] gave and she's got to bring that in the
[1:39:03] manifestation on her part
[1:39:05] she's got to make the wedding dress
[1:39:06] she's got to put the wedding garment on
[1:39:08] and she's got to be ready on that day
[1:39:10] and she was faithful to her part
[1:39:12] and he was faithful to his part but in
[1:39:15] the silence amen
[1:39:17] no brother man when he tells the story
[1:39:19] doesn't tell us about letters that were
[1:39:20] coming back and forth
[1:39:22] no phone calls in that day amen but she
[1:39:25] and the silence was doing her part to
[1:39:27] show that she believed what he said
[1:39:29] about her
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:32] and as it got closer come to the day and
[1:39:34] then they begin to recognize
[1:39:36] that she's been making a dress amen
[1:39:38] she's been taking this word amen
[1:39:40] and putting this word together that's
[1:39:41] been given and and
[1:39:43] all of a sudden the ridicule goes higher
[1:39:47] they've mocked her and teased her but it
[1:39:49] got worse
[1:39:50] why because in the silence she's doing
[1:39:53] something
[1:39:54] and what she's doing is proving amen
[1:39:56] that she believed what he said
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:00] and then comes the day she slips the
[1:40:01] wedding garment off
[1:40:03] and she has the audacity to say that
[1:40:05] today
[1:40:06] i am the bride
[1:40:10] none of the cousins believed her none of
[1:40:12] the denominations nobody else
[1:40:13] believed her in fact they went from uh
[1:40:16] feeling sorry for her to open
[1:40:18] scorn and rebuke that open face laughing
[1:40:21] right in her face
[1:40:22] because she put the garment of the word
[1:40:23] on and she's clothing the word
[1:40:25] and she's now making a declaration she's
[1:40:28] saying
[1:40:28] i am the bride he made a promise to me
[1:40:33] i'm the one he's not marrying any of you
[1:40:35] he's marrying me
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:40] oh praise god what hour we come to
[1:40:43] friends have we come to the hour that we
[1:40:44] can slip the word on and say it fits me
[1:40:47] just right
[1:40:48] because it's for me a prophet has come
[1:40:50] and clothed me
[1:40:51] with the clothing of the word amen what
[1:40:53] he's done for you is between you and god
[1:40:55] but i can say as for me
[1:40:57] that prophet came to clothe me in the
[1:40:59] word because i
[1:41:00] am the bride
[1:41:04] amen the lord has come how do you know
[1:41:06] because he's right here
[1:41:08] veiled behind this flesh boy it goes
[1:41:11] from
[1:41:11] feeling sorry for those poor people to
[1:41:14] hoping that their eyes will be open
[1:41:16] to absolute open mock and scorn
[1:41:20] but it didn't matter because she could
[1:41:23] hear the wagon wheels
[1:41:26] and when she could hear those wagon
[1:41:27] wheels when all of a sudden they saw
[1:41:28] some dust coming up on the horizon
[1:41:31] amen all the cousins you know they still
[1:41:33] weren't believers but
[1:41:34] they knew something was changing the
[1:41:36] environment is changing something's
[1:41:38] happening this hasn't happened before
[1:41:40] and before they knew what happened she
[1:41:42] was whisked away
[1:41:43] and she was gone i tell you in the
[1:41:47] silence something's happening
[1:41:50] there's something that he was doing and
[1:41:52] there was something that she was doing
[1:41:54] and god is going to be faithful to every
[1:41:57] promise he's
[1:41:58] faithfully completing everything he said
[1:42:01] he would do
[1:42:01] amen i want to be found just as faithful
[1:42:04] doing what he told me to do
[1:42:07] to put what did she do oh praise be to
[1:42:10] god
[1:42:11] she kept on washing dishes
[1:42:15] she already had the promise she was
[1:42:17] already engaged she was betrothed she
[1:42:18] knew it was happening
[1:42:19] she had the promise it was as good as
[1:42:21] done and she
[1:42:22] kept washing dishes and she kept being
[1:42:25] the servant to everyone else around her
[1:42:27] amen
[1:42:28] receiving the promise didn't give her a
[1:42:29] right to change her position until her
[1:42:31] husband said it's time to change
[1:42:32] position
[1:42:34] she had to get up monday morning after a
[1:42:36] fantastic sunday service i got my
[1:42:38] the scales fell off my eyes i realized
[1:42:40] i'm the bride i
[1:42:42] realized that the bright coming of
[1:42:43] christ is happening in me i wake up
[1:42:45] monday morning and i gotta put boots on
[1:42:47] and go right back to the same old dirty
[1:42:49] job
[1:42:52] praise be to god what's that amen that's
[1:42:54] allowing the manifestation of the word
[1:42:56] in your position
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:01] but then she spent all her time
[1:43:06] faithful he left her there amen you stay
[1:43:08] here
[1:43:09] you prepare i'm coming back what did she
[1:43:12] do
[1:43:13] she spent all of her spare time
[1:43:16] with the word her wedding garment
[1:43:20] all of her spare time she did in this
[1:43:21] earth what she was supposed to do
[1:43:23] she held a position as the washer woman
[1:43:25] amen as a servant of all
[1:43:26] she held that but in all her spare time
[1:43:29] she was busy with the word
[1:43:32] making sure it would fit just right
[1:43:33] making sure everything was just right
[1:43:36] what should we be busy in this time we
[1:43:38] should be busy with the word friends
[1:43:40] all of our spare time we still have to
[1:43:42] work we still have to do all the things
[1:43:44] that we're in this
[1:43:45] life to do amen we're here he wants us
[1:43:47] here he wants us doing all of those
[1:43:49] things
[1:43:50] but in all our spare time we should be
[1:43:52] spending private time
[1:43:54] enjoying that word that he's left us

[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:38] i
[1:46:40] you know when brother banham saw a
[1:46:43] vision
[1:46:45] just like our brother kadima was telling
[1:46:46] us he saw the vision going to pray for
[1:46:48] the girl and
[1:46:49] the old lady was here and somebody had
[1:46:50] to move a hat from one place to another
[1:46:52] and there was another lady
[1:46:54] everybody was in position and until it
[1:46:56] was positioned
[1:46:57] he couldn't pray for the child to be
[1:46:58] healed but when everything was in
[1:47:00] position
[1:47:01] what that means is that scene has played
[1:47:05] out
[1:47:05] somewhere before
[1:47:08] that means it's finished it's already
[1:47:11] happened
[1:47:11] it's already done if god can show it by
[1:47:15] vision to a prophet
[1:47:16] it means it was already took place in
[1:47:18] the mind of god
[1:47:19] it has already happened amen and now
[1:47:22] he's showing it to the prophet and now
[1:47:24] the prophet is getting down into the
[1:47:26] vision
[1:47:26] where it's becoming manifest and all
[1:47:28] he's got to do
[1:47:30] is wait for everything that was already
[1:47:32] the way it's
[1:47:33] the way it was in the mind of god
[1:47:36] to now come into the perfect reflection
[1:47:38] on the earth
[1:47:40] and when that happens it's the
[1:47:42] manifestation of the vision or the
[1:47:44] fulfillment of the vision
[1:47:45] although it was done from before the
[1:47:47] foundation of the world
[1:47:49] that's why when when brother john told
[1:47:51] us he said the manifestation of the
[1:47:53] promise is the fulfillment of the vision
[1:47:56] so you don't have to see the vision amen
[1:47:59] to operate
[1:48:00] in the vision because god has already
[1:48:03] seen the vision
[1:48:05] god has already seen in his mind amen
[1:48:07] and now by divine revelation he's moving
[1:48:10] us by revelation
[1:48:11] amen and as that word comes to
[1:48:13] manifestation
[1:48:14] it is the vision on display whether we
[1:48:18] saw it or not
[1:48:19] god already saw it and now
[1:48:23] we're living friends if you're a
[1:48:26] predestinated sieging of god you are
[1:48:29] living
[1:48:30] in the vision your life he already saw
[1:48:33] your life he already saw certain things
[1:48:35] that were going to take place
[1:48:36] amen it's already taken place in the
[1:48:38] mind of god
[1:48:39] and now we're trying to be sensitive to
[1:48:41] get the leadership of the holy ghost and
