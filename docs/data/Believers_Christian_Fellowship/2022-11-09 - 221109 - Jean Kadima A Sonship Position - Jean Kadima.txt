tonight to speak to them who am I where am I to be here but it was your sovereignty that called man to preach the gospel so we just wait upon you tonight you can you can your children feed them from the mana mana from above let them drink from The Rock the Rock of Ages Jesus Christ we commit ourselves to you and all this assembly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may take your state for a while thank you musicians wonderful I want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] I would like to give you an update on the work that I've been doing in Pittsburgh it has been almost one year actually almost exactly one year that have been going to uh to Pittsburgh and work closely with a small group there the Pittsburgh Believers Tabernacle so as we were laboring we came to the realization that there was something missing for the church to actually operate more efficiently um so many things when it to have a church operating there are so many things that are in play so just an example we will go there as a ministers we will um dump things on them and then we will leave and there is nobody to pick up the broken pieces and that's the role of a pastor and we have been operating that way it was not really efficient issues decisions to be made so um the last day we were at the retreat they made the decision to get a pastor and and chose me to fill that position so ah yeah for a while I was just uh I was praying and I was showing the Lord that uh there are so many things that make it difficult for me to do it and I was kind of uh asking him if really it can go away uh but it never worked sometimes I saw signs that showed that maybe it won't happen but at the end turned back and came back to me so uh so I'll be filling that position that role in Pittsburgh actually um I'm already doing that um so this is not a family move um uh when I came here to Pittsburgh it was a family move I just told my family we go to BCF and that was it but this one is I see it as a in a missionary field and I cannot bring my family and say hey let's go missionary field so it's uh just to feel like God asked me to do this work with my human eyes I cannot even understand I cannot understand even the logistics things like that but um since it has used me in a past there is a little pattern there so I I have just to go with that I don't know how long uh what's gonna happen and all that so I I did not even ask my wife Josie to go with me but she went she she always go with me so she's very supportive um yeah even my my children they they come from time to many times with me so I've been supported but they belong here BCF so this is not a a family move um Priscilla will be coming you know I may be using him from time to time for a few works there as the Lord is leading but um yeah this is where we are I have a strange pattern in my life so but that's what God chose to do what [Music] um what has changed actually is in the past I was working alone I was always alone I never had external support not even moral support a really hard sometimes I'm in a remote area where I cannot even reach my local churches like 2 000 miles away and Communications not good and I'm facing issues I don't have anybody to talk to but this time is different look everybody that is is with me now I have have so many friends so many brothers and sisters I'm asking you really really pray for me pray for me and I need your prayers so this time is different I even have a pastor the other day we were talking over the phone I asked him a uh you know a Doctrine or question I said I see this this way what do you think at that time when I started this pattern nobody to ask no one I'm totally alone but this church has been very supportive where the Chad has been very very supportive I kept him updated so I'm not alone it's different so so thank you for that thank you you know even a missionary need a local church do you know that yeah you don't even know how long you're gonna be preaching maybe it's already over I did not know doesn't make sense but it God thinks he did not bother by them say that people will be expecting this event will happen then this then this then there'll be the Rapture and they will be told that you already passed so we know we don't know how bad that things so I'm just going with obedience to what he I felt like he told me to do I need your prayers and yeah please uh visit us in if you are in the area but I love this church I love you guys uh has been a wonderful time a wonderful time a training camp for me do you remember one day I I dreamed that I was in a training and I came to church but Chad was talking about soldiers being trained actually giving the interpretation of my dream on the puppet that's wonderful I've been really blessed a benefit a lot from this ministry benefits a lot I'm a great beneficial of it and I you gave me the Liberty to preach because every time I come I say I will take my Liberty and I'll look at you you say yes go ahead what a better way to be trained so I can take a subject I'm not too sure about but I have the Liberty they told me preach whatever is in your mind oh my that's great training so you have been so good to me and I love you all right really God bless you we we really at the beginning um right now we are in a SM in a old it used to be a former a school so we rent there like by hour by the hour it's not really convenient and we're trying to find a place so it means we are really at the beginning where we have nothing almost it's like when we get the new place we're going to need everything like even chairs to start with so so it's good it's good it's interesting so uh yeah that's all I can say to you I'll be in touch with you uh next week I'll be here there is a special meeting I'll be here so I'll be here so and God made it God has a strange way of doing things uh you know kovit came he was a disaster but kovid made that I can work from home yeah it's like a raise actually working from home yeah but it's good because it's helping me to be more available and then I have a schedule that allows me to to take a day off every other Friday so I'm pretty available and God willing we will still see each other please keep us in prayer God bless you let's just stand and go straight to the word we're going to go to uh I have a little thought tonight um once again I'm taking my Liberty uh Galatians chapter four [Music] Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 6 let's go just a couple verses and and because the ER Sons God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then it ear a ear of God through Christ may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word let's pray one more once again precious Heavenly Father come down in your power of Resurrection speak to your children we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can take your seats I want to take a subject tonight of of a sonship position um I realized that as the pastor was preaching the other time I realized that they asked multiple dimensions multi-dimensional there is a multi-dimensional relationship between us and the Lord and one of the relationship he was showing was a relationship of husband and wife bride and bridegroom and this sonship position is a position of air meaning that uh you are a son you are growing into a family and you are called to air to be ear or inherit the family business right so the father has to raise you so that you can take over when is no longer around and this is a different really relationship different from a husband and a wife so and as brother Chad was preaching it was showing that the the wife is not a servant to the husband although she serves him but she's not a servant but she revered him she as Sarah used to call it Sarah used to say my Lord can you imagine when Sarah saw this angel coming the Elohim when he asked her to when Abraham asked her to go make things ready ah Sarah just went not as a servant but as a wife as a sweetheart my husband wanted me to make this dinner she did not say it did not even tell me that he has guests coming you know she just went with joy why was she a servant no she was a wife and she was doing it for her sweetheart and she could go to him and say ah my Lord because that's how she addressed him yeah my Lord the food is ready you and the guests can come to the table my Lord but he was not a servant it was love that brought her to that to reveal her husband now looking at that I say what about the the sonship position this is another position another dimension of our relationship with God how does it work and I cannot really be the one answering that question but I would just say things the way they were coming to me sonship relations a sonship position or sonship relation we see it to understand sonship position as we read it in Galatians we can read it in Hebrews Hebrews 1 1 where it says that God who at Sandra times and in diverse manner speak in time passed unto the fathers by the prophet had in this last day spoken unto uh unto us by his son whom he has appointed a of All Things by whom also he made the world so you see the sunship position is a position of inheritance as a son he inherits everything as a wife is sit with the husband but as a son it has to be raised right it has to be trained it has to be brought up to the point where the sun can take care of the business that's how I see sonship as a position where the father is working to bring you to the level where you can take care of the business here is the prophet speaking in here em he said now if that boy was born now listen if that boy was born in the home as a son but he did not become a right boy would not to follow his his father's instruction would not be about his father's business that boy was always a son but he never did had an inheritance did you know that he never got any inheritance it was just Cast Away he was always a son this is a very critical and I know what I just spoke about it when he spoke about the adoption it will always be a son but the person the purpose is for the sun to become mature is the purpose is the Sun to be trained the purpose is the Sun to become responsible and that's the relationship that we have I'm talking about this because sometimes it looks like the sonship relationship seems to be more uh tough it's really tough that you feel like is is it a merit-based no it's not a marriage base it is still sonship meaning you are air so you have a privilege you have a privilege to be the heir of the all the the families business but for that then there is the father has to be strict with you because of the love that he has he has to be strict with you all right why because just is what is the reason the reason is is going to replace me is going to inherit so I have to raise him differently so this is not a wife and husband relationship because we in that relationship we don't raise is that right uh we don't raise our wives I hope nobody dies we don't correct them hopefully nobody dies all right uh we I just want to show you that it's a different relationship amen ah we cannot say I'm educating my wife wow is that right it's a different type of relationship it's a sweetheart relationship but this is a uh Hebrews chapter 5 6 say that as he sayeth also in other place thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek who in the day of his flesh when he had offered a prayer as a supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared this is a relationship between the Father and Jesus Christ and we can see here he the bible say that he he offered prayers and supplication with strong crying tears unto him that was able to save to save him from death and was heard in if in that if he what did he fear he fear to be abandoned by the father he fears separation with the father but yet in on verse 8 8 it says though it was a son yet to learn his obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation and to all them that obey him I never understood this scripture about the son who has to be made perfect by the suffering that it has to take that the suffering I never understood how can Christ be can be made perfect by the suffering I just don't never it never made a much sense to me but that shows that this the human spirit that the human spirit is the spirit that need to learn obedience I don't understand how Christ could learn obedience because it was God in flesh but I think being 100 percent God and 100 percent a human he somehow has to be to learn obedience and God made sure that to put him in a condition where he learned obedience uh and this one is you learn obedience when it was in Gethsemane and he was crying to the father as he and said I uh he say if it was possible let this cup go away from me but only you will let your will be done he had no place to stay it sometimes he has no food and in gets the money is so the cup of sin coming upon him he knew that touching this cup will mean that he becomes sin it will be separate from the father therefore he cried from to the father please let this cup go away but only by thy will and this is why we can understand by made perfect made perfect through suffering so as you can you can see I'm just trying to show that there is a different relationship between the sonship between sonship position and wife position those are not just terminologies those are not just words but there is a real uh relationship that we have with the Lord that is completely different when we look at it in a different angle the relationship with wife and husband are different from the relationship with a son in the relationship within the sun and the father is not is a different relationship with a husband and wife but I even though I don't know how all this work together but each relationship as a is has a need are you with me it has a need and it has to be applied in the right place okay let's keep going hey we can see here uh let's go to let's just jump in in the message Ministry explained he say this so therefore it was not my righteousness my family goodness it was the grace of God that brought the gift down to the people see and it just happened to be that God chose it for that purpose then as it goes on it's gradually grows greater and greater all the time getting more and more and then in this night two or three people had come and have been praying for and was healed at uh the platform and I looked out and I seen that man I noticed as I look at him I seen he was covered over and coming there his face looked very red and just above him I seen a puppet like this and a man preaching and I looked down again and it was the same man I saw a sir you're a minister said yes sir then I begin to see something unfold just in front of me and I seen him and I say yes you are a minister and about oh let me continue here I say yes you are a minister and about four years ago God told you to do something that you did not do and you failed to do it and since then it's been nothing but trouble and you are just from the hospital now with a bone graft in your leg he begin to to screaming and crying and there God heal him there let me uh with this show you this relationship this man came to the prayer line for butter Branham to pray for him and brother Venom is having a vision you see this man is a preacher he sees his face is red and a vision comes and he say I see you on the puppet you are a minister and he said to him four years ago God told you to do something and you did not do it and from that time on you've been trouble after troubles and the man started crying recognize Ed and start crying and he was healed right there I want to show you that you understand you read the message you read the Bible you understand this is not a relationship between husband and wife and God punished this man just chasing him because four years ago God spoke to him to do something and he decided to do something else and his life went like to hell right and as a father he could not let him go that route as a father raising him for an adoption to give him a responsibility God chastened him by letting the devil come and give him the sickness now our relationship this is not being said so that we can be scared of the Lord to build a relationship of being afraid if I do this is going to do that I don't know how it works but the only way I can understand is is teaching him to be obedient because as a son he is a heir of the throne is the air with God then therefore God is training him so that he learn obedience are you with me and God does not need to do anything it doesn't need to do anything it just needs to remove protection from him and all these demons will come and all this demo will say oh we got an open door let go there and I want to show you that when God does this it is with love it is actually because he loves this person is actually because of the love in his heart that he allowed this to happen Revelation chapter 3 tells us that as many as I love I rebuke and chasten okay so be jealous therefore and repent he say if I love a person I will chasten that person I will punish him so it is a privilege when God spanks us so he's like because he cannot do it with the boy next door is that right if you go a father you go to the boy next door and spank him before you go to jail they will go with you the mental hospital [Music] I only spent mine I chased and only mind okay do you see that the relationship I'm struggling to explain is that it's a relationship of Father and Son and that in that relationship this um depending on what age you are if you are a little bit little spanking is good is that right if you're a little older sometimes it will be a little rebuke raising a little bit The Voice all right it could be uh if you are a little bit older you can just speak to you it is prerogative what is going to do but the purpose is to get you where you want it to be because the the pressure is on the father to raise you right that's what it is it's a very different relationship he has consequences of our actions but it's not to punish us all so we can think that because I do this and then I have a merit no there is nothing it's just a a child born in a family you're just born in a family you do what that family does and at the end you will have a certain responsibility so the pressure is on the father to raise you right amen brother Venom is talking about another case almost the same this is happening in some of this Scandinavian uh places where he went there there was somebody who was translate for him and uh uh and one morning the Holy Spirit woke up brother Branham and say go and go turn right turn left turn like like your program in the car turn right turn left turn and finally it get to a place where he saw these interpreter yesterday and that interpreter had a similar problem that we just read and I just in a split second I seen my interpreter from the night before and I knew something's going to happen because it just kept getting closer and closer I knew what was going to happen it's going to be right away come up to me and shook my hand and there he say brother Branham it's something strange I I say just a moment I begin to tell him and he looked at me and when he did I seen us in a vision standing there when he was translating the night before I say you just come from the hospital haven't you yes he said yes sir I say you have one of your kidney kidneys removed and he says that's right I just met him the day before one thing that uh from the platform that night I say about three or four years ago you were supposed to do something and you did not do it it's not true he said yes that's right say then you had an oppression and since your operations went over into the other kidney that's right he said that's right and I say last night when I was praying in the congregation of prayer did not you take your hand and take hold of my coat like that real easy he started crying he still his hands up in the air say that's right brother Branham and I say God I asked God last night if that was so that he would confirm it and about a half an hour ago he told me get up and go down on the street and in just one second time I would miss him there it was confirmed of his healing how God works in mysterious ways so these things is something we need to talk about from time to time yeah and God does not raise spoiled kids ah God feel the pressure let's use the word pressure like he was a human God filled the pressure to right to raise the children right and sometimes it goes with situations like this then you are a child trained you are chasing so you can understand sometimes when the child is little the only language they will understand is the Lolo spanking that's how it works and then when when they grow up you don't need much of that if you do it there is something wrong okay then but there will be something that will happen for the child to know that the father is not happy with me and they will want to rebuild the relationship with the Father the father is still there is still loving father but the son filled that emptiness and want to reconcile with the father and that's how we work is a different type of relationship but that relationship is there and ASM as a minister I have to share that with you I have some time to show that it exists that God can do something to bring you back in line and it's a part of love is not a legalistic it's love yes yes brother Benham in Africa I don't like to hear that story it's for me I just so heartbroken or something you know he's here uh uh look Africa report trip report I just kept on praying along about three or four o'clock in the morning here he come I say who or maybe seeing a vision who are this a man and what do they mean Lord and he say go on with them but you are going to pay uh for it if you go with them say you can go and if you want to go want to go all right but remember you're going to pay for it you see I put this one in green to show you that the angel is saying you know he said if you go you're gonna pay if you want if you want to go all right why is it saying that seems to me the angel sees brother but I want to God because otherwise I would not understand it's in a foreign country it has no password it has no money he doesn't know things and even his managers have are now together with the other group the denomination that want him to go to Johannesburg but God wants him to go to Durban but his manager together with that group and is alone he tried to tell them even better both work does not understand he said no no he was great in join us it was wonderful let's go this way let's go let's end and the angel is telling him if you want to go with them God this is me this is a gunman taking my Liberty that I look at it I see something underneath the the Angels so that brother Branham wanted to go because uh of a complex that it developed when he was a child it was a complex where he was raised in environment where people didn't uh he didn't have friends people rejected him and therefore when he grew up because what is a complex a traumatic uh event happening in your life then your uh your actions now are irrational and you can see him here if you follow him closely the trouble that he had with God was to because he want to please people it is constantly want to please people the first trouble he had with his mother-in-law was to please and that complex God knew and he could tell him if you want to go if you want to you've got to pay about it and what he did Again release the Demons of amoebia and he attacked the prophet for months and month and month it was sick people thought William Branham is dead because they could not hear from him because God told him you're gonna pay yeah when I read it before it was like it's unfair it was it feels unfair but of course I know that I cannot be the lawyer against God it's all the word is already right we may not understand clearly think but the word is always right the fear of rejection the fear of Abandonment by friends was there the angel could see it go go go go and you're gonna pay about it you're gonna pay why because you are a son a son let me put it this way has a privilege to be chastened the privilege of pig's chested oh my I don't chase and other kids somebody are scared mine I do they are ears of all that I have don't you remember the Prodigal Son his brother who was jealous what did God what did the father told him tell him he said all that I have belongs to you but your brother was lost now he's found right yeah let's just take that part everything that I have belonged to you that's what the sun has everything the father has Belongs to You therefore I am forced to raise you right that's exactly right yeah so complexes I read I listened to brother Brenda many messages he sometimes certainly pray about complexes but I never seen him saying my complexes are gone why they may just be there the traumatic events that happen in your life now you're acting that way but he he learned to recognize them and keep them under the blood recognize them oh this is my complex because complex uh is not a good thing but you have to recognize because complex stops you from being you and God can only use you because no one else can take your place only you can do what you do because nobody else can do what you do but if you are not you how can God use you I'm a poet when God taught him this ah he had a follow-up just like when you tell your son daughter something you want to follow up did he get did you understand what I said did the lesson got in him so the next after he was healed he had to go to a to another trip and God gave him a vision ah he had that Vision was mixed with a dream he had a dream then a vision so he did not know did I dream did I see a vision and God made sure that it does not understand the vision because he made sure just by mixing it up by giving a message that is not that clear but is clear but the prophet did not understand and uh why because he want to test to see if the lesson he gave him in South Africa got to him he's a father he's raising him yeah that's what he does and then this is the in this Faith Africa trip report you can you may have read it already before me then brother floor came up and uh sitting in the room as the Gallant pastor of any group of people he discussed it when he said brother Branham I know that God did this uh I'm not disputing your word but a flow you say but look here what is uh then brother back to say no brother Brennan we got to the minister this brother here under consideration I say yes that's right what is happening here brother Abraham realized it should not be in a Battle Creek Michigan it should be in a different city but because the vision was messed up he understood that he has to go to Battle Creek when he started the minutes ministering he found that it was not working something was wrong in the operation of the gift so he decided to go pray and God told him that I did not ask you to go to Battle Creek Michigan you should go to different city so God put him in the same condition as in South Africa so now you gotta choose where what to do and then is uh manager again is telling him to consider this the ministers who came and supported and all that now he has to make this decision like in South Africa what is he doing is this the father is Raising educated training his son for a purpose to be heir of his business what are you going to do but but the back says telling brother Branham you gotta consider all this group that came to support you and brother Branham exactly the The Human Side takes over yes we need to consider then he hears that the wind [Music] the the angel is in a room reminding him in South Africa you consider now you want to do it again you know what's going to happen now we don't serve God because he's going to punish us this is a different relationship that's what I'm trying to say is a different relationship is a relationship of love you want to make sure we're gonna get there yes now I say ah say the rest of the cooperating ministers 14 churches we got them under consideration I say that's right brother and just then the Holy Ghost I failed it if you believe me to be God Almighty he had permit me to to be kind of mixed up in that vision for the first first one those of the first time in my life uh God's servant you listen to me now uh to get me right back on the same Pinnacle I was in correct dope whatever word uh South Africa he wanted him to be in the same situation as in South Africa to see if the lesson was learned it's a father different relationship nothing to do with your wife it's a different relationship with bride and bright groom you don't test her then you will punish her it doesn't work that way I should not even say that but you understand right but the sun you can do that because you uh praise that child in admonition of God so there I was the ministerial group this all under consideration and even the manager speaking towards the ministerial group and here I was standing here to make my choice to serve God to do what God did and do what the ministers say do that was my place the grace of God came down because the purpose of God was not to say I'm going to beat you if you don't do it I want you to learn he even came to rescue him but that presence of the Angel was to rescue him I wanted to do right you see different relationship churches we need to we need all this relationship raise the relationship of husband and wife but father and son is even there is a relationship for brothers is our brother do you know that he as a brother it goes ahead when he succeed we succeed is that right when is resurrected we resurrect is it goes ahead when he you know is a we he has a leadership a position that's another uh dimension of the relationship we have with God we should not ignore that yeah in the message this is a this is another message where the Branham had a family that come to church from time to time you don't see them in church every time they come when there is a special meeting there we come sometimes they don't come one to three months they come and then something happened the daughter is sick it's terribly sick she's going to die and he is brother when I'm goes and she she has a baby and the baby is condition is not good and she's the situation is like the baby has to come out uh otherwise she's going to die it's a very complicated situation I don't remember the story very well and when he went there and pray that the whole family that has been a little in and out they say we're going to serve the Lord if our daughter is here and part of them say great so he pray the girl becomes fine and uh they were saying no now you're going to be operating and everything will be fine and you know the story that woman at night she's telling her mother I'm going home and the mother said yeah you're going home tomorrow everything will be fine say no I'm going to my heavenly father home so and she passed away and when brother Branham heard it it could not believe it to see how the family was so joyful saying that oh this is wonderful if she's here we go we're going all to be to give a heart to the Lord look he takes her like that and and brother Branham goes and in this message God that's called doesn't call men to judgment without first warning him he said I don't know that caused me to do it but I say Lord God you owe me an understanding see after me going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the Lord after you've done these things for him and all like that and then take that girl's life like that I say you owe me an understanding so when you have your son grown up like that he's saying you know you owe me an explanation you just say wow who did I raise you know you know God owes you an explanation but this is good that we have that in tapes and books shared is experience with us and those are not things that he's proud of but it was gracious enough to share death so we know so and and what happened is when you tell God something like that he will leave you sitting alone [Music] he don't owe you he owe me nothing I am in debt to him so what he did he just ignored but as a child that has just sent you know through it through a tantrum you owe me an explanation as a kid like that you just look at them except if they do it at Walmart that was not me that was the pastor that's why so uh uh so you see uh as a father I he could not tolerate such a thing who am I raising as a father you say a grown up a personalized experience with you saying you owe me an explanation why did you let that girl that woman die God look at him ignore him and sometimes that's why the Earthly father dies our fathers are limited but you are not alone and sometimes difficult children like that they think they are Untitled to they are Untitled they just feel the Untitled and now Heavenly Father could not let his son to feel like it's Untitled what's going to happen to him it's just to see the disaster yeah he feels like that it's on me to make sure this boy this girl doesn't think the world that owes him anything everybody has to be nice with me I am the center of the universe it doesn't work that way and if you let him you see what is going to be in the future and our heavenly father sees that he say what is he going to be in the future he ignored him for four months don't talk to him then after four months he gave him a vision to show him what happened that woman was supposed to die because she fall in a creek and her dress was Tangled to some rock or whatever and she turned blue with the Water by her husband found her and she it was her time to go but God found that that she was not ready to go that's why that day God made sure that she won't pass away before repenting and giving her heart to the Lord it did not have to explain to us to him you know God does not owe us explanation there are so many things I don't understand at all at which way to turn [Music] he has the prerogative and whatever it does at the end it will be for the inheritance it will be for our good the pressure it was in our heavenly father to correct him because he has to take care of the business we will reign with him sonship is reign with him his inheritance amen are you with me amen I know I know I know I'm very tough tonight right that's how he works tonight I don't know either way okay now the Angel and the commission brother Branham you know this story um I'm just going to hide it a little bit from you this story is uh brother Branham used to tell people uh if you have any sickness I'm gonna pray for you just give me time if I take longer enough you're going to be here God will answer you just needs to take long enough keep praying and he did it for a while even a paraplegic girl her brother when I'm just pray and now a 45 minute and the bones were back in place and she could walk and uh but when I'm keep doing that but the heavenly father knew that that was wrong in that relationship in the relationship of sun he has to correct him he sent the angel to talk to barabena and is the angel came and said this in the Angel and the commission I felt it moving close to me and when it did I just heard a voice sound like a way back I could not impersonate the voice if I had to but I heard it just as plain and audible as my voice is to you say you are confining too much of that gift of healing to perform Miracles it will come to pass that people will not believe you unless there is a miracle performed I say I will never I shall never do that again so help me God and he went out of the room but uh more details of this is you can see here this Angel did not go right away the angel comes to brother Birmingham to tell him what he's doing is wrong is gracious enough to tell us that so he can help us in our walk with the Lord you're confining you you can just see that this is not what a brand name vocabulary all right another one doesn't talk this type of English is is English is close to my but uh is the end you see that that the person who made the language was speaking to him he's telling him that you are confining meaning that you have restricted the operation of the gift and made it something giving is give it a scope that it doesn't have right you move that uh uh that boundaries of of how a healing gift Works healing should be a person is sick they believe that vertebraham can pray for them and they pray for them and they are healed but now you have changed the way the gift Operate Now is going to be before people believe you give them a miracle you have just changed the usage of the gift of healing and its purpose was not just to rebuke him and and be mad at him it was to correct his son because his air is coming to correct him to train him to make him more mature more responsible then brother but I'm saying I will not do this again help me Lord and the angel did not even live immediately at that point he has given his message is not by anger that this the father is raising the sun It Is by love so you can see the Angels sit back and stay there and Brother Bear thoughts a thought come to him what if my son see the angel my Lord do you mind if my son can see you I want to show you that because it was not the anger by anger that he came you did yes you did this you confining the usage of the uh the use of the gift of the healing gift that you using it the wrong way no it was to tell him to correct him with love then he sit back and it did not turn into light and disappear is it bad and whatever I'm saying can my son see you and yeah my son is always a concerned when I go traveling he think I'm gonna die can he see you and the angels say the angel just stayed there and finally Billy Paul was able to see the angel of the Lord it was not a rebuke with anger it was the manifestation of the love of God those that I love I rebuke for what for the purpose of training them for the duty that I have for them for the inheritance that I have for them what a privilege being rebuked by our father when you come to church and the message that day is Staff tough on you remember that the love of God manifested to you in a sonship in your son's ship position and the minister a pastor should not feel like this is not good for me to say it has to have that Liberty because that rebuke is a privilege only to his children not to anybody else I will not go do it for the next the child next door only mine I rebuke for a purpose amen oh my God time is flying I did not know in experience the prophet say that but first came so here I first came for scan we reverent about our head everywhere for prayer father dear we come to thee today just as humbly as we know how to approach thee and realizing the last time that I stood on this puppet I was condemned man I stood here and realized how helpless I was without you feel your presence leave me and to see me come here before a little girl I was just merely hard of hearing and see her go deaf right here on the pulpit this is a story where brother Branham after the Holy Spirit told him not to confine the healing gift into a performing of Miracle he found elupo to please people a people pleaser thank God for sharing that with us again he found a way of bypassing the father instructions like yeah we did it when we were boys and girls and yeah father said six o'clock at home and I find a loophole and that's what he did he said no I'm not going to pray for hours for healing miracle for a miracle but I will put the people that have a visible infirmities like blind like you know uh handicaps and things like that put them in a first line and start praying for them first and the light of sickness after so just a little bit by passing no no no I I did not pray for hours for one person but this was different he knew in his heart that it was the same thing you understand what I'm talking about it was the same thing it was just making taking a detour and God saw it and as he was preaching thinking about what is going to preach he saw himself like Balaam where God told him not to do it not to go Balaam went and God say that and and he felt in his heart he fell in his heart to say Lord if what I'm doing is not right I'm asking you I'm asking you uh the person I'm gonna pray for if they are not healed then you are not happy with me and what Buddha bam did at that time was actually to put this scripture on hold for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance he said to the Lord when I pray don't answer the prayer then I will know what I did was wrong but the gift and calling are without repentance even when somebody is in the wrong the gift can work but he say to the Lord put it on hold for me because I don't want a gift that is operating outside of God perfect will I want the backing of God in my gifts I don't want a gift that operating just because gifts and calling are without repentance I want to be the perfect will I want all the kingdom of God to be behind me when I'm exercising my gift that's what he did and that child that was hard of hearing became death pretty much another came same thing why because God told him you confining the use of the healing gift and to give into miracles and it will happen that people will look for miracle before accepting the healing and that's wrong that's not what I say and I cannot let that happen to my son somebody else can do for their sons and daughters not me are you with my church yes and when their eyes were open they knew him and when God lets things happen like that it does it purposely just just to test you now let me get this before you straight so that you will understand that every Sun that comes to God has got to be child trained it's got to be tested every time if you never you never tested you are not a son what I mean a privilege to be tested it's not given to everybody yeah and he said if you can't stand the chastisement of God then you are allegedly legitimate and and now not a child of God you claim God is your father you say oh I can't believe it I can't believe well that just shows that God is not your father see you would get it and now notice this is testing God tests every one of his children all that come to him must first be tested tried and proved to deserve not to deserve you are already born in the family you are already a son you are a daughter no no no it's not for you to deserve but to get to the level where he wants you where you want to use you therefore we as children we we would like to always be ask God for that obedient part of us this is a different relationship I hope you understand this this is different from a sweetheart relationship which we are part right as a bride we are part of that relationship you know it will not punish it will not let her bride to go into uh tribulation he can't do all the things because that's different relationship but the son has to suffer hex his son has to go through things has to go through training has to learn obedience he has to learn submission to the word of God and when God does it for us when you do something and you feel like you feel like my heavenly father is not happy you say I feel empty some people say that right these days I feel empty that's a privilege that's the grace of God there are people that don't feel anything they can walk do anything but they don't feel anything but you do you say I've been feeling so empty you see that's another way the father acts to bring you back to him that relationship with him is so critical do you agree amen I'll let the musician come there the musician comes I was looking at this sonship position I was like it looks to me like when the Lord speak about the water the blood and the spirit each one is different the water is chemical two gas together water blood organic has DNA totally different and spirit is immaterial it doesn't have a form a shape but they all work together they're totally different water blood and spirit they're totally different they work together we have a relationship of uh of Bride and bridegroom husband and wife we serve him although we are not servant we love him we we sweetheart in that type of relationship but we as a bride we we are submissive to him because he is our head that's a different relationship but in the in the one dimension we are also sons and daughters in that relationship we want to please our father to do his will and to be obedient depending on our age he can sometimes sometimes you can correct that chasten us and all this is done through love all this is love back and forth I remember when I was about 27 years old I start working then I went to back from back I went vacation to my parents and my father has suggested that I I marry a lady if I was a single 27 28 and he had an idea that like we will be really compatible and all kind of things and I I say to him no I cannot do that and he said to me everything that I tell you you just say no well the problem is he was you know it was in denomination I already had the message all right and I look like a Rebel Son it was not a good feeling but when it comes to things like if he asked me to do some task I was one of the best of children until his death I was always taking care of him but when it came to Faith things about what we believe I looked so weird so he said to me but you you don't everything that I tell you you don't like to hear it's like I cannot tell you anything that is good but I remember the conversation went like I say to him father a son always like to please his father that's what is in us even a house where there is issues something inside the son and daughter is to please it is something that God has placed but I can't do it I cannot do this because we don't marry outside of our faith you see our desire is to please our heavenly father if we can do this for the Earthly father what about our heavenly father desire is to do his will whatever you want us to do that's what we want to do because we are afraid of punishment no there is something deeper than just seismment there is a relationship something that God has made we are part of him we are part of the family we are raised to become more like him therefore every time the word comes we should never have excuse against the word of God God has really blessed us even especially this church God has given us the word of life let us show him our love to him by obeying that word by living it because he cannot give it to us without allowing us to live it amen he has made provision for it it's uh it is for our God it was for my maturity it is for us to air we are if the son next door is not here but you are amen do you believe that God bless you uh let's let's all stand you have anything brother will I have a fall father [Music] he calls me his own [Music] illness no matter where I go he knows my name he knows my everything he's [Music] [Music] I have a father [Music] he calls me his own [Music] he'll never leave me no matter where I go He Knows My Name he knows my everything he sees its fear that falls [Music] my name He Knows My Name [Music] he

appreciate your grace and mercy oh Father this message tonight help your children to get it in the right balance it is a dimension that I don't totally can totally explain but it's there it exists so you are bringing us up with admonition and for our good father we don't serve you because of the punishment we serve you for love and you don't do this thing so that we can fear you you do it because we are part of you a member of your family help us father to be obedient to you through your grace and mercy actually we have we can only do it because of your grace we can only do it because you can do it through us is not actually we live in the world but you live in that word in US all that we do is to let you operate and all the time you're trying to to just make us to be submissive to that world so you can operate yourself within us father you know why you had this message tonight bless your children and be with them and give us that sonship understanding because it's real it exists we cannot completely explain it but it's there and we want to please you granted father in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen amen can we sing We are ears of the father well we are is [Music] with the
