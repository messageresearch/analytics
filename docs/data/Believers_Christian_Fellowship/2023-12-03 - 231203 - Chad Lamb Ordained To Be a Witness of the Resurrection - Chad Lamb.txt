to carry this message wherever God will have Us carry it amen while we're standing let's read from John chapter 15 together and then we'll let you have your seats John chapter 15 uh and verse 26 John 15 and 26 but when the a comforter is come who I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and you also shall shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning amen God bless you as you have your seats this is an interesting scripture and uh I'd like to look at it for just a moment oh thank you brother Ben praise the Lord You're my special friend today [Music] I'm sure I'll be needing that here shortly amen so uh so we look at this scripture and U I want to take for a subject if I could for a title this morning ordained to be a witness of the Resurrection ordained to be a witness of the Resurrection very simple thought we've shared on these thoughts before but looking here at at John 15 in verse 27 Jesus is speaking to his disciples and he's saying and ye also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning that is interesting there's more than one way you can take that scripture and that's the way the scripture always is because it has a compound meaning and a compound Revelation you could say that God was speaking to them and saying you'll be a witness because you've been with me from the beginning of my Ministry because when was the beginning was it the beginning of his life or was it the beginning of his of his ministry or from adulthood and but but there's another way that you can look at this scripture and it's one that brother brandham gave us insight into because brother brandham said he told the disciples you were with me from the beginning but if you look through the gospels it's hard to find that exact quote unless you find it in this scripture and you also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning what beginning when the logos came out of the father amen the attributes were there amen when God began to project himself when when Christ come forth amen we were there with him we have been with him from the beginning so it can mean both amen it could it could have multiple fulfillments but praise God God chose them he says because you were with me before Hallelujah and so because that they were from the with him from the beginning they were going to Bear witness of him let's go to Acts chapter one Acts chapter 1 and we'll look at verse 6 when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord wil thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his power but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth it's amazing here Jesus is also telling them this is after his resurrection he's he's meeting with them and he's beginning to tell them that now you'll receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me he already told them that you'll bear witness of me he already told them that before his Cru crucifixion you'll bear witness of me because you were with me from the beginning amen but they needed something else to move them into that role of a witness amen and and if all they needed was just the knowledge of his Earthly Ministry because they already had that but you know Judas had that also amen there was other people who had a knowledge of his Earthly Ministry they needed more than just the knowledge of his ministry they needed more than just the record of his life amen to be this witness they needed a power that would move move them into the role of a witness and that power would be the power of the Holy Ghost because we know that the power of the Holy Ghost is the quickening power to bring the C Gene of God to bring the attribute of God to life so that part amen that part of them that was eternal you with me that part of them that was eternal was the part that was with him from the beginning the beginning of the beginning of the beginning that seed was there amen and it needed something more than just a record record of life it needed something more than just being an eyewitness it needed something more to awaken that part to make them a witness and it needed the quickening power to bring the seed to life and then you'll be Witnesses in in Judea and Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the world Amen praise God now let's look at verse 15 after Jesus spoke these things he was received up into a cloud and then they gather into the upper room and and in verse 15 it says and in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said and the number of names together were about 120 men and Brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas which was guide to them that took Jesus for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst the ther in the the midst and all his bowels gushed out and it was known unto all the Dwellers at Jerusalem in so much as that field is called in their proper tongue oh my goodness Alama which is to say the field of blood for it is written in the Book of Psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another take therefore of these men which have accompanied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out Among Us be beginning from the baptism of John unto the same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection and they appointed two Joseph called barabus who was surnamed Justice and Matias and they prayed and said thou Lord which knowest the hearts of all men show whether these two whether of these two thou has chosen that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon mitias and he was numbered with the 11 Apostles so we see this this while they're waiting while they're tearing in the in the gap between jesus' resurrection and the coming of the Holy Ghost they were in this Gap and they were making preparations and and they realized that Judas had fallen and had failed but they also saw in the scriptures where the scriptures say in Psalms it's actually Psalms 1098 that they're quoting says let his days be few and let another take his office here it says Bishop Rick but in the Old Testament it says office let another take his office so they saw in the scripture that there must be somebody for the one who fell away somebody must take his office so they saw in the scriptures so they said we've got some qualifications we need somebody who has been with us in the ministry from the time of baptism ISM until Jesus was taken up that would that would make you a good witness amen that would be the qualification so so they they wanted to find men who would meet this qualification so they they they proposed two they found one amen who was uh uh barabus and meias and they took these two men and they presented them before the Lord and they prayed and said uh Lord which knowest the hearts of all men whether these two thou has chosen that they may take part of this ministry so now this ministry that Jesus Christ amen had left for for the disciples they were saying somebody must take apart because we see this in the in the Psalms so God we're we're giving you two choices you have to pick between one of our two choices amen and so they cast the Lots amen so they had a they had what they thought would make him them qualified to be a witness because he said here let's let's read a little bit further uh verse 22 said beginning from the baptism of John so let's pick it up in 21 so we get the context wherefore of these men which have accompanied with us all the time that Lord Jesus went in and out Among Us beginning from the baptism of John unto the same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection so what are they looking for they're looking for a witness of his resurrection they need a witness with them of his resurrection and they are looking carnal they are looking Earthly they are looking natural and they're looking for somebody if they're going to be a witness of the Resurrection then we need somebody who meets a qualification the qualification is they must be with us from the time of John's baptism till he was taken up from us and be one among us so we found two that meet the qualifications we present them to God we cast lots the lot fell on Mias Mias is now the choice but here's what brother bandham says in a sign of this time he says look even the apostles after they tried to choose one because of Judas falling they cast lots and it fell on Mias that was the best that they could do with the keys to the kingdom and there is not a scripture wrote where he did anything but God chose Saul an ill-tempered little fellow but he had to throw him on his back one day and let him look up a while and he said I'll show him what great things he must suffer for me see the Church chose Maas but God chose Paul see that's the difference God always does his choosing his election God does that by election by his for knowledge hallelujah amen so they they they had uh uh they had the uh the right idea they had the right it wasn't like they were coming out from Left Field it wasn't like they were completely wrong they saw in the scriptures where this one that fell let his days be few and let another take his office so he say this must happen amen and they hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet that's to lead them so now they're taking their own understanding and trying to find qualifications with what makes one good to be a witness of his resurrection well it must be one that saw everything had an eyewitness that would be one and God never recognize their choice because God has a different set of qualifications all together amen the Apostle Paul says I came as one born out of season amen I wasn't even there on the day of Pentecost I wasn't even there when the Holy Ghost fell I wasn't even following the ministry I can't even tell you all the events as they happened like Peter can or like Andrew can or like John can or like all of them like Ma you know Matthew Mark and Luke and John they wrote the gospels Paul didn't write them because Paul wasn't there following him around no doubt he had some knowledge of what happened but he wasn't an eyewitness from the days of John the Baptist but the baptism all the way till he's taken up amen but God chose him anyways to take that office to take part of the Ministry to be a witness of his resurrection praise be to God so let's turn to Acts chapter n Acts chapter n it says and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went into the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound into Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks Paul amen now comes into an individual Encounter With Jesus Christ The Living Jesus Christ after his death burial and resurrection and he does not see a man all he sees is a light and that light puts his eyes out and knocks him to the ground amen so what did he see he saw a light who was it it was Jesus Christ said who art thou Lord I'm Jesus whom thou persecute verse and he trembling and astonished said Lord what wil thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink amen we've spoke about this I think a couple weeks ago we highlighted this verse 9 and said for 3 days he laid there without sight and did not eat or drink and we we we were when we looked at that we started just thinking and trying to imagine the thoughts that would go through Saul's mind at that time amen he had just had an encounter with Jesus Christ in the form of the pillar of fire that he recognized to be the old Testament sign God in the burning bush God uh the pillar of fire leading them through the Exodus Journey he knew what that Pillar of Fire was that was none other than the angel of the Covenant that was God himself amen and now this Pillar of Fire who put out my eyes and knocked me to the ground and humbled me tells me that he's Jesus Christ whom I'm persecuting and I'm persecuting not a man he's already dead and gone he was persecuting a church a group of people amen and he says when you're touching them you're touching me when you're persecuting them you're persecuting me when you're rejecting them you're rejecting me and now all of a sudden his eyes are out he's laying there no food no drink for three days I can only imagine what the thoughts that are going through his mind he's thinking could I have been wrong how could I be so wrong what have I done how many were imprisoned yeah how many were hauled away how many families were broke up how many meetings yeah how many died all of a sudden his whole world was breaking apart with an encounter with the living Jesus Christ changed everything all his understanding all the scriptural knowledge all his education all his pride everything is shattered amen because he met Christ brother B says in the message Queen of the South he said doctors might be able to come and explain it out to you doctors of divinity this out this away and twist the scriptures around but if a man's ever come to the backside of the desert like Moses in this 40 years of training but five minutes in the presence of the burning bush he knowed more about God than they could have trained him in a million years they might explain all this away and that away but if you ever meet God you've had an experience amen right praise God brother bandam even says in the message persevering he says no man ought to preach the gospel until first he's met God on the sacred Sands where no man can take it away from him the devil can tread on those sacred devil can't tread on those sacred grounds you were there when it happened and you know that you're you know what you're talking about I care how many scientists this and how much that it doesn't matter amen once you've come en counter and come in contact and experience the Living God it doesn't matter what science says it doesn't matter what others say it doesn't matter what happens you were there you know you came in contact with something other than yourself and it was a power that changed you to be a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what happened to Paul that's what happened to Moses Moses listen Moses had the teaching he had the education he had the understanding he knew the prophecy his mother nursed him and brother B said when she bounced him on his knee she would say you were born a proper child you were born under a sign he begins to say you're the Redeemer that's promised to come and now he's got all the intellectual training all the military training and he's got all the religious training because his mother taught him he knew the prophecies he knew the season he knew the 400 years from the time of Abram he knew it all amen but all of that never translated into the right kind of action he never had the power to be the witness of that word until he got to the backside of the desert and for 40 years God was beating out humbling amen taking out of Moses all the stuff he had to get out of Moses but even that wasn't enough yet amen even that he got him humbled he got him broken he gave him a hot tempered wife he had everything he needed Amen to get his character right amen but even that never moved him back in the power of God to be a witness to testify to manifest the word it took an encounter with the pillar of fire god in a burning bush he had to come in contact with a living God and that changed everything God used everything before what his mother said still counted the prophecy still counted all that he had learned still counted all the humility he gained and the character that he gained in the trust it still mattered but none of it in itself qualified him to be a witness of the word it was his encounter with the power of God and then he went with a message and then he defied pharaoh he defied everybody he stood in the face of the rejection of his own people amen all the comments all the criticism everything that happened listen he killed one Egyptian and at the threat of another slave of exposing that he runs scared Into the Wilderness but now after meeting God face to face he runs back for his commission he runs back he was ordained to hold that office and nobody else was ordained to hold that office but he had to have something more than what he had in the 80 years Amen to equip him and Empower him and now he would face down threats from Pharaoh threats from government he would face down even his rejection of his own countrymen I feel sorry for Moses sometimes he stand the the the he come to deliver these people from the task Masters amen so he's got to face the world and the taskmasters and all the Devils yeah right they hate him and they want to kill him and they' like to get rid of him and and he's got to face that down but then he also has to face the misunderstanding of his Brethren that he came to save and he came to deliver and now they're mad at him because it got worse and why did you come in trouble as it's better that you never came the poor guy was standing there he couldn't win this way and he couldn't win that way amen but he could stand there because he met the pillar of fire he could stand his ground and stand in his position not because he was strong not because he had power amen all that he had ever done had failed but an En counter with a burning bush changed him completely he still failed he still had mistakes he was still Moses but there did something in him that he could stand in the face of all opposition because he knew this is the word this is the time this is the truth and Now's the Time for it to be manifest the Apostle Paul went through the exact same thing amen he had Zeal but he had Zeal because he was benefiting from the Jews religion he prospered from the religion he was prospering in the education he was making Headway with the elders and with the high priest he had an audience with them he received letters he was moving up in status everything was fine for him and he was moving in that channel and his Zeal I believe was a genuine Zeal but the Zeal was also self-promoting it was convenient and I believe it was a genuine Zeal because you see he says just as much Zeal after but he he's humbled afterwards so he's zealous he's he's moving in the Jews religion he's benefiting from the religion he he he he he's got contacts he's got education he's got respect he's got it all but in a moment's time everything changes now when he meets God face to face when he comes in contact with the pillar of fire that he knew to be a manifestation of God and that manifestation of God says I'm Jesus whom you persecute in a moment's time his whole Paradigm changed am he realized he was wrong realized what he was doing was wrong all he had been taught was wrong I mean it didn't change the word it didn't change the prophecies it didn't even change his desire to be zealous for the word but what it did is brought him in contact with the word for his day am right amen Christ in his day and it changed his understanding and from there he no longer needed the church support or letters from an elder or to be well thought of or a good education from that point on he didn't need any of that and he would stand listen he would stand in the face of governments that were given him he would stand in the face of religious leaders who used to love him now hate him he would stand Amen in the in the synagogues where he was welcom and now he's rejected he would stand rejection from there rejection from the Civil Authority rejection from the religious Authority and then after he goes around in in his ministry he receives rejection from his Brethren the very ones that he brought the gospel to would turn around and reject him because false Brethren would move in with false Doctrine and he was and he was rejected from the top he was rejected from the side he was rejected from the back he was rejected all around but how could he stand because he met a living God he wasn't hung on nothing else but this is God's word God told me [Applause] himself amen and now he could stand there with everything else all the opposition and all the sometimes they loved him sometimes they hated him all the all all the Civic rigers where they were trying to kill him amen but sometimes they would listen to him in audience and they would give heed to him and the whole city would praise him sometimes they would Stone him into tried to kill him sometimes the whole city would gather together to chant his demise they would welcome him into a synagogue as a teacher after he started preaching Christ they would kick him out and go to civil liberties or Civil Authorities and try to have him killed and then they would take him out of the city and stone him for dead he would get up and dust himself off and he'd walk into the next city and preach Christ amen what did it he had an encounter with Jesus Christ because he was ordained to be a witness of his [Music] resurrection praise God that's why before you preach the gospel you must have an encounter with Christ you must be born again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in no because you will face all the same opposition that Paul faced and Moses faced it takes something more than good training or a good church or support groups takes something more than that you're going to have to know that you know that you know not just for the preacher the day is getting darker and darker friends and opposition all around is mounting that's we're all going to have to have the same experience to make it all the way to the end let's go to uh again the next chapter n let's start reading again in verse 10 and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananas and to him said the Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I'm here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called salt of Tarsus for behold he prayeth and has seen an A Vision a man named ananas coming in and putting his hands on him that he might receive his sight then ananas answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he ha done to the Saints at Jerusalem and here Heath Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me oh I know it looks bad I know he's doing all wrong I know he does ananas if I could just rephrase this without changing the Bible ananas I know he doesn't meet your qualifications for Ministry and an I I know it doesn't look like he should be the one who takes judas's office I know he shouldn't be the replacement Matias was there all along Matias looks good Maas is probably super nice to all the brother and treat him maybe shelter him and protected him and this man is is running them through the mill taking them to before the magistrates and having them arrested in stone and all this I know he doesn't meet your qualifications but he meets my qualifications from before the foundation of the world he was with me from the beginning and he's the one qualified to be the witness amen and it doesn't mean Mias wasn't there at the beginning E Mias received the baptism of Holy Ghost but he wasn't ordained to take that Bishop brick he wasn't ordained to take that office and that part of the ministry that was by God's election by for knowledge from before the foundation of the world he always knew that Saul would be Paul would be the one who fulfills that who takes that office so not taking anyway from Matias I believe he was a brother I like to shake his hand and tell him that I love him on the other side but he wasn't the one amen that was going to take that office that was ordained for Paul amen amen so he says he doesn't meet your qualifications he doesn't look like one that's worthy to take the Bishop Rick of him that fell I I I know it looks bad I I know but listen go on yeah just do what I tell you to do I know what I'm doing but the Lord said in him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and the Kings and the children of Israel what is it to bear his name it's to be a witness verse 16 for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and ananas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou comest Hast sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received his sight forth with and arose and was baptized I say thanks be to God amen amen God knew where his chosen vessel was and God knew who was going to fill that office God knew who he had ordained he knew he was El and he knew it was down inside not what was on the outside of Saul God knew what was on the inside of Saul and God knew how to bring it to life and it would take an encounter with himself an encounter a meeting with the pillar of fire with the Living Word it would make that encounter and that encounter amen would bring life to the ordained predestinated seat on the inside and so that he could fulfill that office let's hold your place right here in Acts chapter 9 let's turn to acts 23 just want to read two scriptures quickly in Acts 23 and 11 23 and 11 and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified this word testify also means witness as thou testify of me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at Rome Paul was called and ordained to be a witness turn over with me to 2 Timothy 2 keeping your hand in Acts 9 second Timothy 2 Timothy Chapter 2 and verse 8 remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel what's he doing he's a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is that what he's doing am according to his gospel he's going around testifying to the Gentiles that Jesus Christ resurrected from the dead what were the disciples looking for they were looking for one qualified to be a witness of this Resurrection they thought in order to witness the resurrection you had to see the ministry in order to witness the resurrection you had to be there you had to hear his voice you had to follow the ministry you had to be there amen when you saw the crucifixion you had to know when he was arrested you had to know the circumstances about I mean the stone that was rolled and the seal that was placed and you needed to have firsthand knowledge of all of those things to be a witness and you had to see him after he resurrected and you had to see him in his Corporal body that resurrected you had to be there during the private conversations when he met his disciples amen and all of a sudden God bypassed all of that to be a witness of the Resurrection you don't need to see with fleshly eyes you don't have to have natural experience and Earthly experience to be a witness amen you have to have an encounter with the Living Word With Jesus Christ to awaken that Eternal part in you that was with him from the beginning to stand in your day to witness of Jesus Christ to witness of the Resurrection Paul was a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ because he met Jesus Christ but he didn't meet them the same way that the disciples met him in the resurrection amen he met him amen when he went back into the pillar of fire form that form that was now in the church church amen cuz he says why persecutest thou me that Pillar of Fire was in the body of Believers and that's how Paul met him he didn't meet any other their qualifications but he sure met God's qualification and if that was God's qualification to be a witness of the Resurrection then I stand here as a witness of the Resurrection cuz I've met the same qualification by the grace of God cuz I believe by faith that I was with him before the foundation of the world and he ordained me to come forth in this day and I was going every which way but the right way but in some time he came to me and I met the pillar of fire the same one that that was here with the word the same one that had his picture taken over brother bam said the same one that brought the word is still here delivering the word and I come in contact with a living breathing Jesus Christ making me qualified to be a witness of his resurrection amen that's what makes me a witness of this message not because I was in the prayer lines not because I was in the meetings I wasn't born yet I didn't have to be born yet we can all be one born out of season praise God we're never born out of season we were born in season this is our season cuz we've been ordained to be Witnesses of his resurrection hallelujah amen praise be to God we live in the day that the word is resurrected again it had been laying as if it was dead through the Dark Ages but by the grace of God it's raised again in the last days day and its power Amen in the promise praise be to God amen amen let's keep reading Acts chapter 9 God verse 17 and ananas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jes Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou comest has sent me oh ananas comes and just confirms you met Jesus Christ amen there was no doubt in his mind you met Jesus Christ Amen brother saw the Lord and he comes and calls him brother listen Hey listen he didn't meet his qualifications he didn't see how God could choose he had no idea naturally but as soon as God said he's a chosen vessel amen there's no more discussion discussions over this was God's choice and ananas had no option but said brother Saul a few days ago he was my enemy I feared him the whole church wanted to stay away we didn't want him to come to Damascus we didn't want to have nothing to do with him amen but in a moment's time God changed anas's whole Paradigm he had to change Paul but he had to change ananas as well until ananas says hey I know what evil he's done to all the saint Lord no way no no no this can't be Lord haven't you heard Hallelujah amen he can't be the one and and and it's almost like God says back to Anan no anas aren't you hearing I have a testimony I have something that I have a record that goes beyond back before he persecuted the church back Beyond his birth amen back Beyond he did right or wrong I have another testimony another record when I ordained him when he was with me in the beginning amen I foresaw this day and I ordained him to take the bishop brick that was left by Judas and ananas who also came in contact with God he had the ability to surrender to the will of God and not to his own thinking so he comes in and says brother Saul amen that's not what he said just a few hours before Oh this is the power of the Living Word this is the power of the Holy Ghost this is the power of the Life of Christ in The Believer it transcends our thoughts our feelings or emotion all the things that we've been trained what we've heard and what we've been taught there's got to be a power that'll break beyond all the natural powers and all the natural reasonings and bring us in line with the will of God ananas himself had to surrender to the will of God that Paul was the choice amen he could have gone on thinking well he no you know he's he's got pretty bad temper he can get pretty cross and he's pretty straight and he's been pretty nasty like I heard reports like when he took the women and children away from their H he was rough with them God this is why we love election and pred we've all been wrong we've all gone wrong we've all thought wrong amen but there's another power that has separate us from ourselves and bring us back amen breaking spiritual Amnesia bringing us back to the right understanding ananas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou comest has sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forth with and arose and was baptized and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus and straight way he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God oh he didn't need to training course he didn't need a certain amount of time to soak in amen something happened to him because he was ordained to this office before the foundation of the world he didn't have to become a disciple of a certain right oh yeah but immediately at meeting Christ he had a revelation that's the truth that's nothing but the truth that one that was crucified by us that was the Christ that was the one that was prophesied to come that is the Son of God he knew it he knew it immediately oh let me read that again and straightway he preach Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this this name in Jerusalem and come hither for the intent that he might bring them bound into the chief priest but Saul increased the more and strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving that this is very Christ oh he was ordained to that position nothing could stop him we know that immediate IM he had the Revelation immediately he knew and God would bring him right into Damascus and he would confound them knowing the word but then God would take him into Arabia for three and a half years and begin to teach him the word the Mysteries God he already caught the revelation of who Christ was but God would bring him back and he would teach him instruct him himself then he would send him from there to Jerusalem Jerusalem to Antioch and from Antioch he became a missionary around the world Tau by God himself he why he was ordained to that position nobody nobody could argue with Paul they could but they'd be wrong cuz Paul was ordained to that position no one else was sent to set the church in order Paul was ordained to that position and the message influence brother man says they offer of a man in the church is Anointed not appointed it's anointed the pastor the Evangelist the prophet the Apostle must be the anointed office of God Not Elected by man man tried to elect that office one time they cast out Lots poor maias I love how brother B said poor meias can you imagine if that was you and you thought that you were now had the bishop rck you were an apostle and all the apostles have this blessed Ministry and you're trying you think the lot was cast on you and you think you're the one and you're attending I pray I hope God came to Mias at some point and said it's okay Mias amen Paul's the one and Mias go oh thank God I've been trying so hard God because if you're not ordained to it you're not ordained to it amen it's a position that God ordained Maas wasn't ordained to that position that's why the scriptures write nothing of anything that he did or said poor Maas that's the way I feel poor Maas never done nothing but God chose Paul and he did something because he was anointed and we've seen these officers try to say this is Holy Bishop so and so and this state so and so man this is so and so man it never amounts to nothing but when God comes in and takes over then we see the anointing of the Holy Spirit vindicate the word of God Amen this is why amen this is why the church doesn't vote on the offices we vote on deacons we vote on on trustees we vote on Sunday school superintendent but we don't vote on the five Ministry offices because that is ordained by God by foration you can say well we vote on Pastor no you do not vote to make anybody a pastor you vote to submit that this is the pastor God chose for here that man's still a pastor whether you accept him or not if he's ordained to be a pastor he's a pastor he may not belong in this group he'll go somewhere else but you don't vote to make somebody a pastor amen he's a pastor by the foration of God the church just votes to recognize that God called this man to be our pastor and we submit to that but you can't make a man a pastor by a vote right amen amen and if God's ordained that office amen nobody else can take that office nobody can push that man out of that office amen whether it's a pastor evangelist teacher amen Prophet Apostle God's position him there and then and and if the church doesn't get the vote who gets the vote God gets the vote and he votes by vindicating that man's Ministry because in that Ministry Souls will be saved people to be delivered people be he the word will be rightly divided it's the Vindication of the Holy Ghost that this is the ordained vessel amen nobody can manufacture it nobody can Pump It Up amen nobody can copy it it has to be God and God Alone amen and it has to be ordained from before the foundation of the world turn to Galatians chapter 1 Galatians 1:1 Paul an apostle not of men praise God neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead Paul knew who made him an apostle amen it wasn't the casting of lots it wasn't the choice of a church it was God that's why he could stand when so much termoil was going around he could stand and declare the truth and stand and declare the truth why I mean Deus forsook him everybody leaves him he only Luke Remains the churches he founded now rejecting him churches he founded can you imagine you come to them they knew nothing amen they were heathens they were living in Asia Minor in a Greek culture mixed with a Roman culture and you move in there and you bring to them this glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ they accept it amen they they they now listen to you amen you you established them as an apostle which is a missionary you get them established you place an elder there you move on and another false yeah Minister moves in and begins to seow seeds of discrepancy and now they want to cast out the Apostle Paul how could he stand such thing because he was ordained he's an apostle not by man not for man not by man but by Jesus Christ amen amen that's why a minister is not voted on because he can't live to appease the people to win the vote amen right because he's not made a minister of the Gospel by the vote of the people but by the predestinated plan of God and he doesn't have the power in Ministry by the people he has it by the anointing of the Holy Ghost and God vindicates his ministries the ones he sends into the Earth let's go to revelation chapter 19 Revelation 19:10 says and I fell at his feet to worship him this is the angel that is showing all these things to John fellow his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus this word testimony is translated witness 15 times 14 times it's translated testimony it means a testifying the office committed to the prophets of testifying concerning future events but also one who settles testimony before a judge so it means to be a witness to testify to witness he says so so he's saying I am thy fellow servant of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus I have the witness and testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy what what is the whole point of Prophecy and this word prophecy in the New Testament is used in multiple ways it's used to for tell future events it's used to be an oracle of God but it's also used for preaching under the anointing of God that's why brother Brenham said New Testament prophets are preachers because that word is used that way in the New Testament so it's to to Proclaim something by divine inspiration amen it can be a future event like in what we traditionally call prophecy but also preaching falls into this same category what's the whole purpose of Prophecy it's the testimony or witness of Jesus Christ that's the point what witness to testify that he's resurrected he's alive he's present tense amen I ask I I'll ask all of you a rhetorical question how do you know that Christ is alive it's a good question how do you know because you can say well I read the Bible but how do you know the Bible's right well so many people and archaeological evidence there's just as many people disputing it and more than those who are defending it there's just as many intellectual papers wrote against it as there are for it or even if they accept some of it they don't accept all of it and they pick it to pieces and some of this was written by Paul it's authentic some of it's not authentic and some of these dates are right and they're not right I mean come on how do you know that Christ is a liive how do you know that Christ ever lived Jesus Christ ever lived did you now he's resurrected we believe that but you can get millions to believe that because they've been taught that since they were a child because there's a culture worked all the way around that information that's easy to believe it's not so easy to believe if you're raised in a Muslim culture if you're raised Hindu that's not so easy to believe amen it's easy to believe believe in a in a Christian culture very easy to say Do you believe that Jesus Christ lived 2,000 years yes did he die for the the sins of mankind absolutely amen is he alive today absolutely they believe that but why do they believe that they believe that based off teaching they believe it based off information they believe it based off of a culture but I said God help us never to have faith in education or culture or traditional teaching we must have firsthand experience that Jesus Christ is real and is alive the question is how do you know that Christ is alive that's a question I can't answer only you can answer that question nobody else can answer that question how do you personally know that Jesus Christ is alive and if you start to look at books and information and historical facts you're going to miss the whole thing completely CU all of that can hinder your faith all of that can be twisted and manipulated to cause you to disbelief but if you ever meet Christ yourself you know that he's alive and it doesn't matter intellectual ERS or people falling from the mess it doesn't matter anymore because you amen by firsthand experience have experienced Christ the same one that was in the Bible that does the same things he does in the Bible amen that acted the same way he did then acts the same way in you amen and then you're not testifying off a paper off a document of something you read or something you heard you become a first count witness amen you become as we could say an eyewitness not this eyewitness but the eye and the soul that can see the truth you become an eyewitness of his resurrection amen praise God now's my second question how do you know that this message is the truth how do you know because the preacher makes it sounds so good and because I read the book cuz I was raised in the message cuz it makes sense I can see it add up that's the same thing friends amen it can be the same thing like people's faith in a real Jesus Christ a real man who lived 2,000 years ago who resurrected from the dead they believe it amen but they believe it on the wrong with the wrong kind of Faith they believe it on the wrong basis they believe it on a basis that can be adjusted or moved or questioned amen and let's not believe the message the same way but how do you know this message is the truth I'll tell you the only way to know Amen to find out that this message is the truth is the same way the Apostle Paul found out the message of the Resurrection was the truth amen not by somebody talking to him and convincing him and showing him data and facts and eyewitness accounts Paul believed it before he met an eyewitness of the Resurrection Paul believed it before he could go and find well there was 500 amen that saw him that day let's go talk here's three or four here's their testimony see how they all line up Paul didn't need the testimonies to line up he didn't need to meet an eyewitness he didn't need to meet Peter first or James or John first all he needed to meet was Jesus Christ and when he met Jesus Christ he knew that Christ was alive he knew that he was the Messiah and he knew that the message of his day was the truth praise God Amen praise God sometimes I'm fearful that as Generations go by and are raising the message it'll become what the Christian denominations have become but we all must have a first hand knowledge Yeah by meeting Christ ourselves that he's alive and well I want to be a witness of his resurrection and I want to be a witness this message is true I want to testify that this message is true not because I saw how many people fell off a bridge not because I stood and watched blind eyes open I mean those are wonderful testimonies I love them there ain't nothing thing wrong with them I listen to them all the time CU they encourage encourage me all the time but I must be a witness myself and I must be a firsthand not a second hand not a third party amen that won't even be accepted in the court of law amen I must be a firsthand authentic witness because I myself have experienced it amen praise God but praise the Lord I believe that the bride in this day is ordained Yes To Be A Witness of the Resurrection brother B said God who is Rich and mercy said many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you knowed where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you and that was before the foundation of the world and saw the word and you came to it Paul was not the only one on the road to Damascus yeah and he was with the company we don't know the number but there was men that were with him and in different accounts in the in the book of Acts as Paul begins to relate this in the book that the account we just read it said the men were astonished they heard a voice but they saw no man some they heard something but they didn't see anything another time it says they saw a bright light but they heard no voice there were other men there and there were other men that saw and heard things there were other men that could attest something Supernatural happened they could testify I don't know what it was it was strange something Supernatural happened then they saw the effect it had on Saul who was now smitten blind and they had to lead him by the hand all the way into the city amen they could testify that something Supernatural took place amen but they were not ordained before the foundation of the world when the supernatural fell in their presence it wasn't for them it was for the one who was ordained to be quickened the life when that Supernatural fell and when he caught that amen when it come in contact with him it changed him he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he was baptized in jesus' name he took his ordained position and became an apostle to the Gentiles because he was ordained to that position amen you and I have been ordained if we are the seed of God if we're God's children amen elect for this day we have been ordained for the day that we live in you have been placed here by God himself knowing when the sea would come forth and what that sea would do and you are here amen listen we we say it all the time but you are not here amen just to live the American dream you're not just here to work labor retire you may do all of those things that's not the primary purpose and those things aren't wrong but you are here to be a witness of his resurrection you are here to testify that this is the truth am brother bandam goes on to say like my little Eagle story oh how the little Eagle was hatched out under a hen the little fellow walked with the chickens the hen clucked he didn't understand their clucking and the little chickens their diet they had in the Barnard he didn't understand that he's telling us the story where a farmer takes an eagle egg out of an eagle nest and puts it under a hen in the barnyard and hatches out an eagle with the chickens and now the eagle comes forth confused about his identity thinking that he's a chicken and thinking this thing over me is my mother trying to scratch trying to eat trying to live like a chicken he didn't understand that how that they did that but there was something in him seemed to be different from what that chicken was because of the beginning he was a eagle I'd say this from the beginning you were a son and daughter of God from the beginning I can say it maybe I could say it like this from before the [Music] [Applause] beginning he said that's the way it is I'm sorry he knew something in him seemed to be different from what the chicken was because at the beginning he was an eagle that's right one day his mama come hunting him and when he heard the scream of the eagle it was different from the cluck of the hint and that's the way it is with every Born Again believer you can hear all the theology you want to and all the man-made discrepancies but when that word flashes out there then there's something takes a hold and you come to it amen you who were once dead in sin that life has he quickened there has been there has to be a life there to Quicken to first God by his forn knowledge knowed all things and we were predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God ye were once dead in sin and trespasses wherein we all had our time our times pass but hath he quickened look at Paul when Paul was a great Theologian but when he came face to face with that word Jesus it quickened amen what did he come face to face with with the word yes yeah what word the word for his day the resurrection of Jesus Christ and now the Life of Christ in the Believers that's what he came face to face with amen he said when he came face to face with the word comma Jesus it quickened amen he came to life right quick because he was ordained to be that amen he was part of the word and when the word saw the word it was his nature all the clucking of the hens the Orthodox Churches didn't have no effect upon him he had saw the word it was part of him he was an eagle he wasn't a chicken he was just in the Barnard with him but he was an eagle to begin with he goes on and says impr proving his word how does he make his word known to the people first God knowing that there would be unbelievers God knew that the fall would take place that's why Jesus Christ was the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world he knew there would be unbelievers now watch the wisdom of God knowing there would be unbelievers and how the majority would be unbelievers he by forn knowledge predestinated a seed for every age that would believe it he knew there would be a fall he knew there would be seeds of discrepancy sewn into the human race and he knew it bring forth a crop of tears and he knew the unbelievers would be the majority so what did he do he predestinated for orain that there would be real seed real Believers planted in each age yeah amen so what are you you're part of that plan because he knew this would be Satan's Eden because he knew it' be a le le to and a because he knew it'd be religious darkness and absolute apostasy amen because he knew it he knew by Foreign Nation I've got to plant a seed there that'll take this word and stand with it amen in the face of all the religious opposition in the face of all the darkness in the face of all the sin and immorality amen I planted a seed there list listen you don't believe this message because you were smart you don't believe this message because you're mom and dad if you believe this message you believe it because you were ordained to from before the foundation of the world and God knew that this world would be riddled with unbelievers so he would plant his seed in every age and you came forth Amen to prove that this word is true you came forth to testify of the message that's why you and I are here and it's the devil's job to distract Us by every technique you can from that purpose to use work to use family to use obligation to use the busyness of life to use all the weeds that creep up he's the devil is using every attempt he can sickness discouragement trials tribulation rejections he's using every attempt to stop you from that purpose cuz that's God's purpose for you amen sometimes we preach we preach so hard amen sometimes against entertainment and world Hess and being CAU amen it's not because we're trying to push a Holiness movement to make everybody look right amen so that we can say oh we're holy it's because those things are actually weeds creepers creeping around to pull the very manifestation out of you that God has ordained you to be here for he wants us cut free from the things of the world free from the entertainments that pollute our mind amen free from all the signals that are coming amen from that fourth dimension to try to what dull our senses and pull us down amen but praise God we got to shake that stuff off and come to the word because the word has to come to life where will it come to life in the for ordained seeds this is why we don't watch movies this is why we don't have television this is why we don't caught up in all that stuff my goodness it's not because you can say if if your eyes lay across the video you're going to hell my goodness it's not that it's because everything's produced in the fourth dimension it's produced by demon power and there's influences there and even if it's not outright evil it's [Applause] distracting it's so entertaining it's so gripping it's so distracting it may not be evil you may be learning amen how to build something amen I'd like to build something someday and so I'm going to look at building raised flower beds right Hey listen I did it it was super helpful 15 minutes I could go do it I mean I kept replaying the problem is it's so good well what about this video what about this and 4 hours later I've learned how to build a raise beted I could have built it in two so we're not against using tools for tools we're not against everything in the world what we're against is anything that'll take me from the purpose he pre-ordained me to be anything that robs my mind robs my time takes my affections God help me please to be free from this world help me be free from all the ties that try to bind amen praise the lord it's not Holiness and legalism to be strict but oh praise God I think we'd do a little better to be a little stricter not to get acceptance from God not to get a merit back not to prove we're better but to be free to be free to express to be free Amen to read the word to pray to meditate Amen to think on God Amen so that God can move through us with the very purpose he's planted us here for I mean don't get me wrong if I've got to fix my car tomorrow I am going to probably watch a YouTube video praise God but I don't need to watch 10 12 and then that was really cool but oh look he jacked it up he put a 4-in lift on it and look oh what why am I watching and he put a 4in lift on it I needed to figure out how to change the timing you see how slick the devil is not the pursuit of evil we're beyond that but oh God help me to recognize my purpose I am here to be a witness of the Resurrection God's only provided place of worship he says if I taught you Methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bride time if Moses taught the message no it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated seeds are laying there that will only be watered by the type of water that's give for that seed God knew there' be unbelievers in this age so he planted his seed thank God Amen but there's only one thing that's going to bring this seed to life it's the word word for this age will bring the seed for this age to life amen they're they're polarized to each other they're magnetized to each other and when the word for the age comes in contact with the seed for this age that God ordained amen it quickens it to life and now that seed Springs forth to life and the power of the word comes into that life to live out the word and as it lives the word it manifests the word when the word says be separate they live separate when the word says do these things they do these things when the word says forsake not the assembling they forsake what is it it's the manifested word in [Applause] flesh what does that do that declares a witness that Christ is alive amen it's a witness that the word is true notice the anointed word of this day of which you are a part by predestination listen friends it's not just that you being a predestinated seed came in contact with the word for the day and sprung you to life no you're actually part of the word for your day amen listen to the message that God gave Saul on the road to Damascus Saul Saul why persecutest thou me who is the me Jesus Christ who was Paul persecuting the church amen Jesus gave him the revelation of the word for his day yes and all those Believers were part of that predestinated word amen and so Paul was also part of that word word but it took the manifested word Christ in those Believers and that Revelation through a meeting Christ himself to awaken that in Paul it took that to put Paul in his position because he was also the word for that day because there was there was prophecies laying in the book of Isaiah that says it would be a light unto the Gentiles who fulfilled that it was fulfilled by Christ in Paul amen so it took the word for his day to Quicken the seed for the day because that seed was meant to be the predestin word for that day amen we're not to believe the message we are to believe the message but not stop at believ we are here to manifest the message we are here to make it live we are here to be the Believers that that Pillar of Fire is living and we are here to show forth that what that Prophet preached was absolutely the truth that you can live above the world that you can live a Sanctified clean holy life that there's power for healing there's demonstrations of the spirit there's gifts in the church we're here to manifest fast that that word is true not just say I believe but no it's active in me the Lord just delivered me he just healed me he He restored my marriage he he cleansed my mind he cut me free from vices of the world I'm here to testify that that word that that man preached is living right here in this vessel and we are part of the predestinated word for this age brother B said uh in the message Witnesses back in 53 he says they can't witness until they have an experience that's true cuz what are you going to witness somebody else's experience that makes you a second party witness that's a weak testimony they can't witness until they have an experience and when they have an experience then they become a witness automatically what do you mean automatically because you were a witness the immediately when you experience the the baptism of the Holy Ghost you become a witness what do you mean become because you experienced it right amen now you're going to witness it am I going have to stand up in church no your life will witness that you've come in contact with God you won't be able to hide it you won't be there's no way you're going to hide that if that eternal light is now living in you and that predestinate see for this day the predestinate word has sprung to life in you how in the world are you going to hide that life of christen amen you automatically become a witness because they were born again and all of the things of the world old things have passed away and all things have become new then you become a witness unto Jesus let's go to First John chapter 5 I'm going look at a couple more scriptures here 1 John I going to go to chapter 5 1 John 5 verse 10 he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself the revelation of Christ in our day if you believe that you have the witness in you I love this whosoever believeth that Jesus is the I'm sorry ver back to verse 10 he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself he that believeth not God hath made him a liar because he believed not the record that gave that God gave of his son and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life these things have I written unto you that believe believe on the name of the son of God that you may know that you have eternal life and that you may believe on the name of the son of God if you believe in the Son of God if you believe in Christ the anointed word for our day you have eternal life you are a w you have to witness in yourself says now now in the rising of the Sun brother says now see now you are already resurrected I love this amen you are already resurrected when God raised him up he raised you the sun is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't didn't it your body came in obedience to it didn't it in obedience to what a church the word which is the life then you are now resurrected from the dead amen we were dead in sins and trespasses but now he's quickened us to life we were dead Amen to the realities of the world we were living dead dead a woman that live in pleasure is dead while she yet liveth am me she's alive in one form and dead in another spiritually dead amen but on Earth she's alive tell me which one matters more where do you want to be alive on the earth or spiritually alive eternally alive we were dead and trespasses and sins but he has quickened us amen you are now resurrected from the dead it is Easter with Jesus and I it is Easter with you and Jesus it is Easter with you and I in Jesus we are all or Jesus you and I we are all resurrected together how can I be a witness of the Resurrection because I've experienced the resurrection what I have experienced the Resurrection The Resurrection is taken place inside of me and that makes me qualified to be a witness of the Resurrection not what man thinks amen but what God has ordained let's go to Revelation 12 now I want to lay in a couple more verses as we move down here to the finish line Revelation 12 verse 10 and they that dwell upon the Earth shall rejoice over them and make Merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them no I'm in 11 sorry 1210 I'm in the wrong chapter 1210 and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night amen when is the devil cast down when the bride goes up when the bride goes up he comes down verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony which is the word witness and they love not their lives unto death they overcame them by the blood of the lamb and the word of their will witness they had something to testify they were a true witness because they had a firsthand experience brother BR the message again Witnesses he said a few moments by the clock to speak to you about Witnesses Jesus said here you shall receive power after the holy spirit's come upon you and then you shall be Witnesses unto me not when you join the church you'll be you be a witness not when you become a deacon you'll be a witness not when you're ordained to minister you shall become a witness but when the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you shall be then you'll be a witness a witness must be someone with an experience must know something in the courts of our land you can't come up and say Miss so and so told me so and so about so and so they'll throw you the case out right then you've got to be either an eye or an ear witness you've got to know something before you can be a witness and you've got to know something before you can be a witness of God and all God calleded Witnesses are people with experience of knowing what they're speaking about praise God sometimes we wonder why we go through so many things and why we have so many trials and difficulties and sickness my goodness praise the Lord I can now testify to you that God's A Healer I can testify I can give firsthand witness he's healed me he's delivered me he's changed me yeah you must have the experience experience to be a witness I can tell you all about the healing campaigns that he did Amen in brother benham's Ministry that will encourage me that will build faith in me amen but that is all secondhand information for me but what's firsthand information for me is when I was sick he delivered me amen when I was needy he provided for me he heard my private prayer and he answered publicly amen amen and in time of evangelism he said the heathens when they worship their Idol they prostrate themselves before the idol and believe that the idol talk back to them that God their God turned come into the idol and spoke back through them now that's just contrary turned around what God is God doesn't deal with Idols you are his instrumentl you prostrate yourself before God and he comes in you and speaks out to the people amen not through a dumb Idol not through a statue not an idolatry they come and expect to get an answer no you you yourself Surrender Your Vessel your clay amen your Tabernacle to him and he comes in you and now he speaks out of you unto the world Amen you're something that's portraying God you're something that's speaking God's word and you might speak it with words or you might speak it with actions but nonetheless you're testifying of the life that's on the inside that's the difference he's the Living God for a living person not a dead God to a dead Idol he's a Living God to a living being and you become his Witnesses what he said here and if I told you the spirit of John Diller was in me I'd have guns here and be an outlaw because that would be his spirit in me if I told you the spirit of artist of an artist you'd expect me to paint the picture of an artist if I tell you I am a Christian and the spirit of Christ is in me or in you then we do the works of Christ that's the witness Jesus said in St John he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also then he said here these signs shall follow them that believe brother made it so simple if John Diller was in me I'd have guns I'd rob banks if if Beethoven was in me I write songs why because I manifest the life that's on the inside but how can I testify that Christ lives in me and I deny his word and go contrary to his word and refuse his word and trample all over what he said is shows that I'm a f I'm bearing false witness amen that's right yeah but I don't want to bear false witness I want to give a true report so if I'm going to give a true report amen I need Christ to come and and burn everything out of me and live himself in me because I don't have the capacity in myself Amen to reflect Christ his nature is too perfect his word is too true amen it takes more than human effort it's going to take the power of the Holy Ghost and I say God I'm prostrating myself before you burn me me out fill me up Quicken this seed to life and use me for your glory and let me rise and be a true witness of a true life on the inside amen amen Jesus told his disciples in John 14 said if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him where is he going to live here right here making me a witness of the resurrected life of Jesus Christ not because I made myself a witness not because I decided to witness but because he ordained me the same way he ordained Paul same way ordained Moses everyone that's been ordained to their place he ordained me and wherever he's ordained me I don't need to I I don't need to have this imagination that if God wants to speak through me I'll be behind the pull pit or I'll be on the street witnessing or no my goodness you're testifying every day of your life you're testifying in your homes your test I I remember a story I remember years ago amen our oldest son Blake I've told this testimony before but he was having severe issues with flat-footedness and it was causing pain down the back of his legs severe pain sometimes at the end of the day he would crawl on his hands and knees up the steps because it hurt too bad to walk up the steps so we didn't know what to do so so we we talked to a few specialist and we found out that we could get heal inserts for him that would correct the the the the the feet raise his arch and that seemed to help we had to keep them in there and that caused some other kind of pain but it worked for a while but one day amen some of the kids were homesick and and my wife was home with all the little kids and I was here at church and I'm pretty sure I was by myself and that day we were having a prayer line and people were coming and getting prayed for and I was here as one of the ministers I believe at the time praying for the people and back home my wife said God you know if we were there we would have Blake in the heel prayer line we believe you and something spoke in her heart you don't need to be there hallelujah amen she had walked into the kitchen she was doing something she'd walked back and she told the kids that gathered all these little kids Blake was probably 10 or 11 at the time they were all younger gathered all these little kids around and told them you know we were there we'd have Blake prayed for and this is what I believe God told me and prayed and God healed that boy right there what was that that was a witness of the Resurrection not in a pull pit but in a home that was Christ clothed in a mother who had concern for her son what was that there was none other than the resurrected Jesus Christ that has the capacity to believe his own word and see it come to pass don't think that you have to go travel some distance or stand on a street corner you witness where you're at witness to the co-workers witness to your children to your grandchildren witness to your husband witness to your wife I've been sick laying in bed not feeling well and I asked my wife I'll grab her hand and put it on me and I say pray with me cuz I believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and I've seen that simple Act of Faith and it wasn't even that she was saying something I was praying I just grabbed her I needed a believer's hand and I laid her hand on me what is that that's the witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that this word works and it's happened in your life again and time again and time again and it will continue to happen but we have to recognize that's the witness of the Resurrection testifying living this word demonstrating this word amen standing for truth when everybody rejects it standing when everybody makes fun of and mocks is a shame standing for the truth proclaiming the truth living the truth demonstrating the truth believing the word all of the word that's a witness of the Resurrection amen that's what we are ordained for in this hour praise God brother BR said in the rising of the sun he said if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you oh Hallelujah it'll Quicken your mortal body it'll make you do things you didn't do before that was so they was so full of quickening power then your body ain't subject to sin no more your desires what is it the quickening power will free me from vices free me from addictions free me from Habits free me from the past what will do it the quickening power because it's the power that's come to witness his res not to witness a compromised life not to witness a failing of the word no to witness the resurrection and God's provided place of where says your hands on the people has got quickening power in them if you've been quickened amen have you come to life has Christ become real to you has the power of God been manifested said are you in that church God's provided Church how are you in it how do you know you've been quickened in it your whole thoughts your whole being is to Christ now and Christ is in the midst of his people proving himself alive proving that he is here at the days as at the days of Sodom he proved it he showed us he showed it in a man with a seventh grade education from the hills of Kentucky who could do what no man could do he demonstrated what was he he was a witness of the Resurrection but God saw fit in this time in life to take that witness away after he had used him to wave the wave sheath of the promised word over the people amen so why so the rest of that crop can come to harvest maturity amen and we could stand as Witnesses of the Resurrection that's why you're on the earth that's why you get sick so you can testify here that's why you have trouble so you can testify of what God did to deliver you that why so we can be witnesses to this world that's why your desires have changed that's why you love the word that's why you get so excited when somebody reads a scripture and the scripture opens and you say praise God hallelujah making you an absolute weirdo to the world but you understand it because it's a life bubbling up inside why you're a witness of the Resurrection it's alive inside of you it's not a dead cold formal church it's not a tradition it's not a religion amen it's a life that's in the people making the people Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday all the way through every day every moment at home at work they're the same what is that that's a witness of the r it's not your life it's his life in you why because you were ordained before the foundation of the world to Bear witness of his name let's look at Ephesians 2 as we finish we know this so well but I'm going to back up and read a larger context Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesian I'm sorry Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians chapter 2 verse1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins am wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others is that true yes we were just like the rest of the world there was only one difference there was something laying down in our soul amen verse four but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where with he loved us even when we were dead in sins ha quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmen ship his creation created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them what are you on the earth for this sums it right up you were here because God rich in Mercy knew you would be here and he knew how to Quicken you and you were raised up with Christ Jesus the quickening power has come and you're saved amen by Grace but through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God and now what now you're here to do what the works that he ordained for you to do Paul did The Works he was ordained to do Peter did The Works he was ordained to do and you and I are here to do the works that show the life of Jesus Christ alive today in human flesh the pillar of fire is here it's Christ himself wrapped in Bride form to live what kind of Life her own life her own no to live his life yes amen because we were created we are his workmanship created unto good works that he ordained we should walk in them whether it's at home with your family at work at school in church whether you're preaching or praying or just having a convers God has ordained you and I to be a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ God the way people watch us handle problems handle our families watch our honesty when we're faced with obstacles even at we're sometimes we get into really odd situations we find ourselves in a a predicament we did something wrong we didn't mean to we're in error but I didn't even mean to it wasn't even originally intended but now I'm here and what am I going to do am I going to hide it or am I going to confess you you're like why am I in this situation because somebody might need to see Christ somebody might need to see a witness that Jesus Christ is alive and that the word is livable amen when the power of Christ is inside it lives and you go and you say hey this is what happened and I didn't mean to but here it is I'm very sorry what do you want me to do now am I fired you know what there's got to be a Living Word Alive in our day there's got to be somebody that can lay hands on the sick not just in church but neighbors amen co-workers unbelieving family members there's got I don't think in church at the end of service is the only time we're supposed to lay hands on them that are saved where's that power that power is alive Amen in his bride in his body amen we just believe it let the life flow be a witness of his resurrection when it comes to qualifications that man would look at I don't have any wasn't a witness wasn't in the meetings didn't had no training I mean just like the apostles we have these criteria just like ananth listen we don't meet anybody criteria friends we're nobodies from nowhere we were doing menial common things living common lives some of us were some of us were bad Common lives some were decent common lives some of us had a good some of us had a bad some poor some rich some everything in between we were just doing whatever the world does but God knew where we were and what we needed to encounter so that we could have an experience that would change us because he ordained us to go into the world as lights in a dark World To Be A Witness of his resurrection I want to finish with this quote and things that are to be he said you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God hey that's good enough for me I didn't get my promotion who cares I mean when it comes down to it those things matter you do good work you get rewarded that's all part of life that's part of our training that's part of learning but I got passed over so what you're nothing yeah I know that but I like that word you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God praise God whether I get the promotion get the job get the new house get whatever I get or don't get it doesn't matter now because I know what I am I'm a gene of the Manifest of the life of God Amen and that's what God wants on display says now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or daughter of God therefore you get what I mean see you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because you're duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate what's he saying you're here to be a witness of his resurrection wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you got eternal life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that the eternal life dwells in you how many can be a witness of the Resurrection let's all stand you can't be a witness unless you've had the experience how many of you can say with me I want to be a firstand witness I do not want to be a secondhand witness I don't want to be a secondhand witness of overcoming life I don't want to be a second witness of of having all the desires for the world taken out of me I I don't want to be a secondhand witness of healing I don't want to be a secondhand witness of Deliverance I don't want to be a secondhand witness of restoration for me and my family I want to be a firsthand witness I want to testify that that promise fulfilled that promise fulfilled that promise fulfilled cuz I can testify by firsthand experience amen that

makes me an I witness Lord God you see us Lord you see our hands you see brother benam said it's an act of will to defy gravity to raise our hands to show you what's on the inside of us it's the raising of a hand it's not the power but it's the life on the inside the desires expressing by the lifting of a hand I desire Lord to be a firsthand witness I desire Lord to be able to testify in any court before any people on the great day of judgment let my testimony stand with the others that you're true and your word is true and you're a resurrected living Jesus Christ and your word is alive

your presence is still Among Us I want to stand and testify Lord God I pray that you would give us each one that experience that we're longing for that you would fill us and keep filling us and pour out your spirit upon us again and again and may we testify to this world that you're alive may we do it in actions and conducts and speech Lord an appearance May everything come together to be a true witness of the life that's inside father forgive us for our entanglements in the world forgive us for our distractions forgive us for those things Lord that that Lord try to defeat your purpose in us

them away from us help us God to stand triumphant by your power when nobody else can stand and Satan's Eden you've ordained those that will stand when the light has been snuffed out of the church and when it's gone into utter apostasy you have ordained lights to shine in the darkness God we believe by faith that we are those lights we just pray God that you would pour more into us and more into US empty us out of everything else and pour more into US Lord that we might shine a pure Crystal Clear light of your life let us be Witnesses of your Resurrection we love you God we ask these things in
