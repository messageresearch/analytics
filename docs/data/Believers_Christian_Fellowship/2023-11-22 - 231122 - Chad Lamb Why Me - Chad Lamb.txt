bless you all this evening amen I'm going to have you take your seats for just a moment and thank you musicians for now amen um as many of you know at the passing of our brother Steve Hollinger that the family has decided to not have a a memorial service or a funeral uh they're going to have a gathering as a family over Thanksgiving but uh I called sister Marsha and I asked if it'd be all right if we just took a few minutes as an assembly and just thank God for the life and the service of our brother for this assembly here so I'd like to start by reading a message from the family it says from the Hollinger Family thank you to everyone for their love and support during the illness and passing of Brother Steve we have been so blessed by all of you there will not be a public viewing or funeral but if anyone has something that they'd like to say or a special memory of Brother Steve we'd love it if you'd write it down and we'll be collecting them for sister Marsha you can either send them by email or snail mail addresses to send them to will be on the bulletin board it's also perfectly fine to give them directly to Sister Marsha or the bogs at church again you've all been such a blessing to us and we're so grateful God bless you amen I thought it would be very appropriate since brother Steve sent spent so many years serving this local church that we would just take a few minutes to reflect on what all he did for us so it's not forgotten uh brother Franco has prepared a slideshow and he's going to he's going to play that and it's uh several pictures of brother Steve and his service to the local body here and it'll just be rotating through as we uh as we have this little service I'm going to read out of 1 Timothy chapter 4 I'm sorry second Timothy chapter 4 you can turn there with me if you like SE 2 Timothy chapter 4 I'm going to read a portion of scripture from from uh verse 6 2 Timothy 4:6 reads for I am now ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but un all them also that love his appearing I believe our brother finished his course I believe he kept the faith anden Psalms 116:15 also says precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints amen I think it it's been a privilege for me to work with Brother Steve and to to U Been a beneficiary of his years of service here and uh I just went through a little bit of history and as I was looking and I might have a little bit of this uh wrong as far as dates go but just bear with me but brother brother Steve first came to BCF right at the beginning of BCF they were he and sister Marsha were here from the very beginning as the church was being formed right around 1989 1990 is when that was taking place and they were they were here from the very beginning and then somewhere around uh the mid 90s we know in 1995 he became the first camp director for the family camp and he was instrumental in getting that off the ground most of you know but some of you may not some of you are young and don't remember those days you were growing up here but you were Toddlers and infants and all those things and some of you are new to the assembly and don't realize that that we would have probably never had a camp get off the ground and grow to the magnitude it did it without brother Steve he was so well suited to organize he was so well suited to lead those kind of things and he was gifted by God and we know that the Ford motor company got the benefit of those gifts for a long time but that's not why God gave him those gifts it was for us amen we needed his leadership and his ability to coordinate those things somewhere around that same time in the mid uh uh 1990s he became a trustee here for the church and uh he served Faithfully in that role for a long time he just resigned that position just a few years ago uh he retired from Ford in 2001 and after retiring he became a Treasurer and begin began to work uh here at the church he also not just became a Treasurer he also became the office manager here at church he coordinated so many things he oversaw so much the office is not as busy it used to be back in the day when Steve took over but the office used to be a hub of activity back then brother Lonnie was still in his ministry and he was traveling all over the world he was connecting the churches all over the place we were still duplicating VHS tapes Cass set tapes moving into CDs and DVDs and the distribution of those was going out all over the place and so there was activity all the time people coming people going distribution stuff being ordered and and he had a way of keeping track of all of it and organizing it all and making sure everything worked out and he did absolute fantastic job in 2014 I became Pastor uh here and I did just I just want to say I never ever could have done it without brother Steve I moved into a position that I knew nothing about I inherited something that was already in motion and already moving and brother Steve knew every moving piece and how it worked he knew what had been done and why it had been done he knew why the decisions were made he had records for everything brother Steve knew every penny I mean every penny where it went he he could remember numbers like I have never seen in my life he would remember the number on the balance sheet from week to week things that nobody else even wanted to know he would remember and not forget and so when I came on board he helped me get acclimated and adapted so fast and he gave me the background to everything how we were and the positions we were in and and why the decisions were made and why things were the way they were and really helped me immeasurably I know God had him there just to help us in that time of transition and you know St brother Steve told me one time uh as he was just we were just talking in the office and sharing he told me he said that his name something about his name meant faithful and that was always his desire to be faithful he told me that Judas failed as a Treasurer and his goal in life was to prove that you could be faithful as a Treasurer something thing about Judas failing Jesus always bothered him and he didn't like the bad reputation a Treasurer had and he was out to prove that you could be a Godly righteous Treasurer and he was he proved that you could be a Treasurer over the work of God and do it right amen so I always I always marveled at what was so important to him and if I could sum up brother Steve and just a couple words one would be faithful brother Steve was faithful am faithful to his d duties faithful to whatever was his responsibility he saw it through to the end always he dotted every eye he crossed every te he balanced every balance sheet if there was times that the balance sheet would be off and he would come to my office in frustration he said I can't I can't get the balance sheet balanced I'm reconciling the checkbook and the accounts I said how far are you off he said 13 cents I'm like just round up or just round yeah and he would go back over the bank wck and he would go back over it and he would work at it for hours until it balanced to the penny he would find where it was off he would find where the mistake was the clerical error the math error whatever it was he would find it and to me it was a no big deal 13 cents we can live without it you know but for him it mattered it mattered and God had wired him that way for that purpose because that's exactly what we needed amen and so he was faith and another word I'd like to use to describe brother Steve is he was loyal brother Steve was absolutely loyal loyal to our Lord first first and foremost he was loyal to his Lord Jesus Christ he was loyal to this assembly he was loyal he was loyal to me as a pastor you know brother Steve was almost twice my age years of experience he had and and he had wisdom and he had seen a lot but yet he was loyal and he would he would he was serving and he was so respectful amen I I I always felt like he is my Elder he knew everything but he would always ask and he would always be respectful he was loyal he was loyal to the position and faithful to the place that God put him and he blessed me immeasurable we got to be quite close as we work together and I have tremendous respect for brother Steven the way he fulfilled his office and I say God was good to us to send brother Steve to us for all those years he served his treasurer for right about 20 years uh he served as uh a trustee for more than that he served for a long time as the camp director and we are where we are today by the grace of God and God using Brother Steve as a tool in his hand and we can all thank god brother Steve came to me at one point with a plan to pay the church off early and it was a good plan and and so we we implemented his plan and and we got the church paid off early am mean this church we sit absolute debt free and part of it's because of brother Steve's faithfulness and his diligence brother Steve was 83 years old when he passed away and and there was a scripture we would quot quote from time to time it came up several times in our dialogue together that we are three score years and 10 we've been promised 70 years but brother Steve would correct whoever said that he would make a correction and and here's the scripture that he would he would quote out of Psalms 9010 said the days of our years are three score years and 10 and if by reason of strength they'd be four score years and would always quote that by reason of strength they'd be four score years and so our brother made it Beyond 4 score years and I'm so thankful because that scripture was important to him and he would use it to correct us all the the time and God gave him the strength to make it Beyond 80 years amen but the rest of that scripture goes if by reason of strength and be by be four score Years yet is their strength the yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away so even if by strength we make it to 80 years our life is still labor and sorrow and it soon be cut off and we fly away and that that's what's happened to our brother he was freed he rendered a faithful service to Christ he served the body of Christ faithfully and loyally and when his work was done the Lord allowed him to depart and go to his reward and we're thankful for that brother Steve was so faithful he was faithful to the Lord faithful to the church faithful to his family he was also faithful to the Ford Motor Company I remember when when I bought a new car I bought a Toyota I was almost ashamed to tell him I was scared of what he would say cuz I didn't buy a Ford and when he knew I was looking for a vehicle he told me of all the good features and accolades and all the good things about Ford and and so when I bought a Toyota he never said anything but I just prayed it would go okay but even as brother Steve we noticed as he got to the end of service we noticed he started to become forgetful he was struggling to remember his short-term memory was failing him and he noticed it as well and he would be more diligent to write things down he would ask us to write things down instead of just telling him what we needed to do in the office we would write it down for him so we knew that the years of service were coming to an end but he wanted to serve as long as he possibly could but when he contracted Co it seemed to uh just accelerate the memory loss and he never really bounced back from that his memory began to deteriorate and his short-term memory loss got worse and worse and until in the end as sister Maria said brother Steve just wasn't brother Steve anymore and it was a great release for him to go home brother Steve wanted to be faithful he wanted to be diligent he wanted to serve he wanted to work he wanted to make sure everything was okay and even in the last part of his life as his memory was deteriorating and his strength was failing and when he would be confused and lost and disoriented and not actually know exactly where he was was what going on the biggest trouble sister Martian's family had with him was to keep him from going to work every day he would get out of his seat determined he had to go work on a project he had to balance the books he had to make sure things were were done right and even they they shared with me when he was in hospice care and he was in such poor health and weakness that he had documents he needed to turn in he had reports that he needed to get done you can just see how that faithfulness was a part of his life all the way through and God used that all the way through he wanted to make sure that he did a good job and the job was done right and the job was done all the way to the end I say thank God you know as our brother became weak and he was no longer able to serve I thank God that he's home because brother Steve is not the kind that can retire and not work on a project and not take care of something and not make sure things are done right and so I thank God that God used him all the way up until just the last little portion of his life and there at the end Lord took him home because he couldn't handle not being productive and so now I just I thank God if God needs a bookkeeper in heaven I don't know that he does but if he does he's got a good one amen so I just thank God for our brother's life I thank God for what he's meant to us and I just don't want want the service and the years of service to ever be forgotten by us it it was an important part of our history here at the church and I'd like to read this quote out of things that are to be brother B says now this old world must fall and it come through disobedience in the beginning he says but the one he is now preparing for you cannot fall because he's making it so I've gone what if we just had to stay in this kind of body aren't you glad there's such a thing as death now isn't that strange but now I say for instance a few years ago I was a little boy and now I'm a middle-aged man I got a friend sitting right there Mr Dow and he's 93 years old a few days ago look at him now 40 or 45 more years what would be what would that would be me now put another 40 years on him where would you go I'm glad that there's something to get us out of this pest house there's an open door and it's called death Jesus stand stands in that door amen he'll guide me over the river he'll take me through that door there's a great door standing Yonder called death and every time your heart beats you're one beat closer to it and someday I must come to that door you must come there but when I come there I don't want to be a coward I don't want to scream and back off I want to come to that door wrap myself in the Robes of his righteousness not mine his and by this I know that I know him in the power of his resurrection that when he calls I'll come come out from among the dead to be with him out of this pest house wherever this body might fall and whatever it might wherever it might land whatever it is I'll come out someday because he promised it to me and we believe it yes sir he's making one that cannot fall amen I'd like to conclude by saying our brother sleepeth because Saints don't die Saints go to sleep he's in that place in the sixth Dimension that brother brandham explained to us and I'm so thankful that in our day that God sent a prophet beyond the curtain of time and let him come back to tell us so that we have such Joy at the passing of God's children knowing that they're in that place that words can't describe that there's no language there's no words in the human language that can describe it it's beyond Sublime there's nothing there but perfect love and an atmosphere that we've all longed to be in and I'm so glad he's there but I'm also so glad that's not the end of the story because at some point the entire plan of God of redemption is going to come to its finality and we're going to come forth and we're going to have a change in the body but before that there's going to be a resurrection of the sleeping Saints and we will have an opportunity for a period of time to see those that have gone on before so that we can begin to connect so we won't be looking for each other when we go beyond and I'm so thankful but there's a there's a something coming soon amen something coming next where we will be United again and I thank God that we will remain in Fellowship continuing in Fellowship our fellowship is only paused it's not finished but one day God will hit the pause button again and all those Saints will come out of the ground and we which are alive and remain shall join them amen with a change of the body and meet him in the air we're to comfort one another with these words I'm comforted amen I thank God musicians if you'll come let's all Stand Together I'd like to sing a song together I'd like to sing this song what a day that'll be when my Jesus I shall see you know there's a Time coming when we'll be back upon this Earth together with our Lord to Fellowship to enjoy that fellowship and you know in the Millennium it may not be that God needs a Treasurer a bookkeeper an organizer a planner in the sixth Dimension but when we come back in the Millennium God says we've got work to do we'll have jobs and brother Venom also said that uh he says death does not change you it just changes your Dwelling Place whatever you are you'll be there amen so I believe God still has work for our brother to do in the Millennium amen and and we'll we'll I believe be enjoying his faithfulness and his loyalty and his ability to do what God's called him to do again at some point amen let's just sing this song together while we're standing well there is comeing a day when no heart shall come no more clouds in the sky No More Tears to dim the eye all is peace forever more on that happy Golden Shore what a day glorious day that will [Music] be what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who saved me by his Gra and he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land what a day glorious day that will be and there'll be no sorrow there no more bir bir to bear no more sickness no pain no more paring over there and forever I will be with the one who died for me what a day glorious day that will be what a day and what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who saved me by his Gra when he takes me by the hand and lead me through the promised what a day glorious day that will be amen what a reunion we have comeing what a glorious time we have to to look forward to amen we sorrow but we don't sorrow as those who have no hope our sorrow is a little different Amen in with our sorrow is Thanksgiving and in with our sorrow is great hope and joy at what lays ahead I'd like to just bow our heads together and just thank God in this Thanksgiving season it thinks so appropriate to thank God for a gift that he put Among Us and a vessel of our brother Steve dear heavenly father we thank you Lord that we can stand here and remember all the wonderful things that you have done for this assembly through our brother for we know we know Lord it was your gifting it was your it was your direction it was your spirit leading our brother Lord as he as he administered an office as an officer in the church and he played so many roles he wore so many hats he accomplished so many things and we stand here Lord as the beneficiaries of our brother service God we don't want to just move forward without pausing and saying thank thank you God thank you for allowing us to share in the life of our brother Steve thank you God for all that you did through him to bless this assembly God so many things that we see around us physically so many things that took place spiritually we're in part because of our brother's efforts Lord God I thank you that you've taken him to his reward you've allowed him to escape the corruption that was set in to these bodies of clay I'm so glad Lord that he doesn't have to struggle or suffer or strive anymore he's run his race he's finished his course our brother kept the faith and you've rewarded him now with true life our brother has been birthed into real life he's moved from the vapor from the Mist to the reality he's gone from the negative to the positive and we thank you for that Lord and God we as an assembly look forward to a grand reunion some someday and I know our sister Mara does as well she's looking forward to that reunion Lord where they're United together in a land that's far better than this land and bodies that are far better than these bodies and the realization of the promise and the fullness of Redemption where we all join together Lord with you upon this Earth God I pray you would bless brother Steve's family may all the service that he rendered for you may all the sacrifices he made May Lord the reward of that be poured out upon sister Mara and upon his children and grandchildren may you reward them for his service may you bless them for the years of sacrifice God I pray that you would comfort them as They Mourn may you be a friend that sticketh closer than a brother at this time may you bless our sister Mara Lord as she's surrounded by our family and as they over this Thanksgiving season remember and reflect upon the life of a husband a father a grandfather May Lord they have sweet memories and a sweet time together as a family and may your presence be felt among them God as an assembly may we move forward Lord and all the ground that was gained by our brother's effort may we continue to move forward Lord for he didn't work for us to Halt and to stop or to fail but he labored so that we would continue on Lord I pray you'd help us to be as faithful as our brother was as loyal to you and to your word as he was and may his life be an inspiration that propels us forward Lord God now as we take this time this evening a few minutes to look into your word I pray God that you would anoint the preaching of your word that you would anoint this vessel to bring your word and anoint the hearers with ears to hear and hearts to perceive may we all grow and continue to grow we thank you Father for all that you have done all that you're doing and all that you will do in our lives we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen God bless you while we're standing why we take our Bibles and turn to Ephesians thank you musicians I appreciate your help this evening Ephesians chapter 1 amen there's a thought that I'd like to share with you there's a uh something that I wrote down on a scrap of paper about two weeks ago I believe it was I was just sitting and I was studying and study and all of a sudden another thought came and I took out a piece paper and I wrote it down quickly and I didn't know when it would come forth but it just seemed fitting to me I was impressed upon me to bring it today and it and it works out well because I know we don't have a lot of time I don't intend to take a lot of time it's a simple thought it's a subject we've preached on from every angle again and again and we will preach on it again and again and again but there was a thought a way that I'd like to express it and I hope that it's helpful to us as we move forward but let's look here at Ephesians chap 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved amen God bless you as you take your seats amen before I go into keep your uh scripture open there we're going to look at this for a minute brother Franco I'm going to go to the Whiteboard too if you can pull that up I'm going to use that here in just a moment I I just want to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving so I don't forget to say that amen I hope you have a wonderful time with your families enjoy some time off and some rest amen I I want to appreciate also uh brother brother Ben and sister Amanda for opening their home for those who want to join in them for the Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow may God bless them there amen and and we have a lot to be thankful for and I I love Thanksgiving I wish we could do it like once a month you know it's my it is my favorite holiday of all the holidays Thanksgiving is my favorite I love the time the quiet still time as a family amen and I appreciate brother Ben he's going to take the service for us on Sunday I asked him if he'd take that for me amen I've got myself just a little bit pour down and I wanted a few days off and I want to go down and see my mom and so he's going to take the Sunday service which affords me some time to do that so I really appreciate that and I ask you'd be praying for the Sunday service also I want to let you know I've got a trip coming up and I keep forgetting to tell you uh here in just just under two weeks I'm going to be going to India I'll be going on December 4th through the 16th brother Ron Garvin and I will be traveling together and we're going for brother Roshan msi's dedication services for his church so they they finally got the church done I don't even think it's 100% done but I think it's pretty close so we're going to go for the dedication Services there then we've got some ministers meetings in a couple different places in the country and then I'm going to be traveling over to brother jarat marapi I don't know if you remember jar rotam marapi he's a brother who's been here before I love saying his name I had to practice for like three days to get it right so I say it as often as I can because it's so much fun J rotten and Marlo booty but anyways he's been asking me to come for some time because he was very very sick with Co he and his wife and the Lord raised him up and then his wife had cancer and the Lord raised her up yeah and this all happened within the last I think year and a half to two years and he's been asking me to come for a period of time because he wants to hold Thanksgiving services for the healing of his wife and for their uh healing and uh and so uh it works out that I can just extend my trip a little bit and do that when I go to brother rashan so we'll be taking part in that so I really really appreciate you praying for us it's uh a lot of travel so just pray for us that God will give us strength and help us along the way amen when I look at this scripture here in Ephesians chapter 1 I just want to highlight a few things that verse four that he hath chosen us it's so important that we never forget he hath chosen us it's such a consolation when that becomes a reality and a revelation to us that he has chosen us amen and when did he chose us where did he choose us he chose us in Christ and when did he choose us in Christ before the foundation of the world Amen why did he choose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love this is before we've done right or wrong this is before we've had a chance to behave ourselves on the earth in a certain way and God chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen so God already had a Plan of Redemption amen so that he could choose us in Christ before the foundational world that we would be holy and Without Blame before him in love it wasn't that we were going to be holy and Without Blame because of our conduct he knew that the fall would happen happened and he knew the kind of condition we become and he foresaw the fall and he knew the corruption that would set in our bodies and the corruption that would set in in the world and knowing that he had to have a plan that's why he chose us in Christ amen because Christ would be the propitiation Christ would be the lamb that takes away the sins of the world his blood would be the atonement and the covering for our sins so he already chose us in him before the foundation of the world because so that we could be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children oh I love this because when brother brandham teaches adoption brother brandham teaches adoption as not birth but he teaches adoption as placing at maturity amen so we would be born again by the spirit of God but we would grow up into him in all things and we would be placed through through a ceremony of adoption through the process of adoption we would be placed as mature Sons and Daughters into a position in his body to serve his purpose amen so think about it friends we can say oh he chose me but I don't know where I'm at and and I I'm never going to make it I keep failing but he chose you he predestinated us unto the adoption of children he already predestinated you to make it to maturity amen amen he predestinated you to be part of the adopted children not just birth but adopted you're going to make it you are going to make it you're going to grow into the stature of a perfect man you're going to grow into the measure of Christ you're going to mature you're going to bump your nose you're going to stub your toe you're going to embarrass yourself but you're going to make it to adoption it's going to happen amen and bumping your nose and stubbing your toe and all of those things are part of growing up process part of shaming yourself part of making mistakes part of becoming embarrassed part of having to make it right amen all of that is the process that works together to bring us into adoption because it's a it's a maturing so that we can move into this positional placing but we've been predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will it's not even because we want it that's right it's because he wants it to the praise of the glory of his grace Grace this is one of my favorite parts to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved amen he has made us accepted in the Beloved I'm accepted in the Beloved why because he made me so by his predestinated plan I'm going to uh write something down on the Whiteboard here this is what this is what I grabbed a paper and wrote down it just came to my mind like a Flash and I've learned to yield to those things and and I wrote down this question has anybody ever asked themselves a question anybody ever had this thought have you ever heard anybody ask themselves this question there's another question that's very similar simar to this why did God use me or how can God use me or why would God use me it's all a similar question so why did God choose me and how can God use me or why would God use me and and you understand when people ask this question there's many reasons why they ask this question and we know that we are not wired the same we're not all the same type of Personality we're not all the same person we don't all have the same complexes we don't have the same backgrounds some people have a bold faith and they have uh the ability just to take God his word and move forward and they don't question those things they just believe and they move forward but there's many many people who has suffered things through their life and they have certain temperaments and certain personalities where they they have low self-esteem they've maybe been neglected maybe they were belittled or put down or condemned all of their life if you have somebody who has a parent that never affirmed you and constantly put you down and ridiculed you and criticized you you have a really difficult time seeing any value in yourself and it's just something that some of us have to bear with and have to overcome and so there's so many different personality types and some people struggle with a question like this other people may not struggle if you never struggle with this praise God Amen but some people have so when as soon as I wrote down this question I wrote down another question uh and this is is the this is the one that really blessed me and this is the one that solves the problem because if you ask me the question why would God choose me I say if you answer my question I'll answer your question am isn't that what Jesus did yeah so if you come and ask me the question why would God choose me I'll ask you I'm just giving you fair warning from now on I'll say answer this first then I'll answer your question why wouldn't God choose me try to think of a reason why God wouldn't choose you well I've made so many mistakes show me somebody in the Bible who didn't make mistakes that God chose well I've lived in immorality before do you remember the woman at the well I I I I did this and I did that show me an example amen where God Amen wouldn't choose somebody because of their past mistakes because of living in ignorance because of believing false Doctrine show me anywhere in the Bible that that made somebody ineligible to be used by God so if you can answer the second question then I'll answer your first question because why wouldn't God tell me something God Amen would would not would not be able to overcome by his blood tell me something he would not be able to offset by his own will and the provision that he made turn with me to Deuteronomy 7 I just want to look at this for just a few minutes and these are like I said things we know things we've talked about but I just want to go through them together Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 6 Deuteronomy 7:6 he says for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more number than any people for he for ye were the fewest of all people but because because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he has sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt now know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant in Mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations God did not set his love upon the nation of Israel because they were the most but you were the they he says you were the least you were the fewest you weren't the greatest he basically he's telling them you had nothing to attract God when it comes to the physical you didn't have a nation you didn't have great people you didn't have great resources you didn't have anything when God came to set his love upon them and rescue them out of bondage they had nothing amen you realize they were slaves they didn't have property they didn't have wealth they didn't have anything amen they didn't have a system of government they didn't have a form of anything they had nothing nothing that would attract God's attention to them the only thing they had is they were already recipients of his love amen he set his love upon them because of his own choosing because of his own will amen it wasn't because they were the most it wasn't because they were greatest he chose them because he loved them period what made him love them that's the mystery of God's love it's by predestination amen amen am so he he says I loved you I set my love upon you not for these other reasons but because I loved you and because I was going to keep my word let's go to Jeremiah now together Jeremiah chapter 1 Jeremiah chapter chap 1 verse 4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations Jeremiah didn't have to do anything become anything learn anything promise anything he didn't have any Hoops to jump through he had no accomplishments to make to earn any position or work or anything that he could do for the Lord before God says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee amen he knew him he had knowledge of him before amen conception came before he was being knit together in his mother's womb God already knew Jeremiah and already ordained him to serve his purpose and already ordained him to be a prophet unto the the Nations what did Jeremiah have to do Jeremiah didn't have to do anything Jeremiah didn't form himself didn't knit himself together didn't bring himself he didn't give himself the Breath of Life didn't make himself a prophet all Jeremiah did actually Jeremiah did nothing this is what God did said I sanctify thee that means I set thee apart for myself I Sanctified thee amen and I ordained thee to be a prophet unto the Nations amen what there was nothing that Jeremiah could do to earn this position and there was nothing Jeremiah could do to lose this position amen let's go to John 18 John chapter 18 I'm sorry John chapter 15 not 18 John chapter chap 15 verse 16 John 15-16 he says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you what a consolation he's speaking to the disciples here he's saying you haven't chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit God already ordained them to be fruitful in the ministry it wasn't that they were going to become really good ministers and they would become skilled over time and they would learn how to handle the word and you understand that's the foolish Mind of a man would think that somehow that these disciples just they finally got some education and they finally did a little bit better and they learned how to preach and Peter got to be kind of a good preacher and and then he had a fruitful Ministry after years of experience my goodness that's the foolish thinking of a human being amen but God says you haven't chosen me I chose you and I ordained you that you should go forth and bear fruit amen that you're going to be fruitful and the ministry that I give you is going to bear fruit because I ordained it not because you got so good at it and you amen that's the some of the that's some of the trouble we get into as we mature in Christ and we grow we begin to think that somehow along the way we acquired skills and we got better and the truth is God is training us we're not we're not ignorant to the fact that that God teaches us things along the way but we're not coming to that by our devices or by our efforts or by our study it's because he ordained it so he ordained us to grow in Ministry he ordained us to grow in understanding he ordained Us in whatever position he's placed Us in he's ordained us to become fruitful so he will see to it that we become fruitful and we will learn the things we learn we will go through the things we need to go through and he will reveal to us the things he needs to reveal to us so that we will bring forth fruit because he already ordained it amen sometimes we get stuck with an Earthly perspective the question why would God choose me it's a very Earthly perspective question why would God choose me and and when somebody asks that they're always referring to their littleness their inability their inadequacy their failures their their their whatever they're always referring to those things and those are all Earthly things they have nothing to do with the Eternal they have nothing to do with the Heavenly and you know it's actually uh the Earthly perspective is not bad in itself because there's some humility that comes with that we should always be in touch brother B said we should always be in touch with our littleness right we should always realize that without God I'm nothing that there really is nothing in me amen I'm talking the flesh side now there's really nothing in my Earthly existence that would make God want to choose me when God came to me amen there was nothing that I had on a natural sense that was attracting God's attention it wasn't like he needed some ability that I had or some skill that he was lacking in his body and he was out searching for somebody who met this criteria oh and I finally found one who had this certain thing that I need my goodness everything that I had that he would use he planted there by predestination anyways he looked after my grandfather and grandmother and brought these two together to get the bell with a certain mix to have a certain T so anything that he was going to use he placed there amen so there was nothing that I had to attract his attention there's only one thing that I had that's a seed of eternal life and I wasn't respons responsible for putting it there he placed it in my soul before the foundation of the world so there there's a there's an that's an Earthly perspective and that's not all bad it's I don't think we are ever in error at being amazed and blessed by the fact that God would choose us when we have no worthiness there's something healthy in that but when it becomes when it when it moves Beyond just a healthy recognition of the grace of God in our lives and it becomes a uming block where we feel like we cannot do something for the kingdom of God we cannot be used amen then all of a sudden that Earthly perspective that that should keep us humble and help us to reverence God and be thankful now it becomes a negative and it becomes a barrier to us actually serving the purpose God put us here for and that's what we have to break Beyond amen we have to have amen we have to understand our littleness but we also must understand our predestination and God choosing us and that God has a plan for for our lives and he can do Supernatural he can do beyond anything we ever thought if we'll just let him do it there has to be a faith that takes hold that overrides the Flesh and recognizes the supernatural amen I think it's amazing that in Matthew 16 when when God asks who do men say that I am and Peter gives the answer and he says you know Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and he says flesh and blood is not revealed this to you but my father which art in heaven and then he goes on to tell Peter he he says it this way he says Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the king kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven amen and you ask yourself who's he talking to he's talking to a fisherman right yeah he's talking to not the Upper Crust of society he's talking to a common working man amen and and in Acts 4 brother bam goes to this all the time he refers to this in Acts 4 amen when Peter and John amen they went to the temple through the gate called beautiful and the lame man was there and they they extended unto him grace and mercy by the grace of God and he was healed went running and leaping and jumping into the temple and it created a stir and they arrested them and they questioned them and they brought them before the Sanhedrin and now Peter and John listen Peter and John were fishermen yes who were hiding from the Jews just a short time before but now under the power of the Holy Ghost they became Witnesses and Spilled Out onto the street now they're going to the temple to worship now a notable Miracle is done now they're hauled before the Sanhedrin and if we if we don't think of Peter as the great Apostle and John as the great Apostle of love but we recognize them as common men amen who are now standing standing here before the Sanhedrin it's super intimidating it's like somebody plucking you up right now today and setting you in the halls of Congress to answer before the joint house of Congress and you'd be like um um um um um but they had this to say when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men unlearned means illiterate no education in ignorant is an interesting word it means rude or base or or the opposite of of of anything that was in the Sanhedrin they were the exact opposite educated and Noble and worthy they were they were rude and base and uneducated there was a stark contrast going on here and they knew that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus amen why they took knowledge they had been with Jesus why they marveled because this is extraordinary these men shouldn't talk like this these men shouldn't have this boldness they shouldn't have this ability they shouldn't be able to answer us back amen where did it come from it came from the predestinated plan of God because he ordained them to bring forth fruit it wasn't skill it wasn't eloquence it was the power of God in their lives and if Peter continued amen continued with the idea I'm just an ignorant fisherman I can't do anything I'm just an ignorant fisherman God can't use me I'm a nobody in this life I'm an ignorant fisherman how can I preach the gospel amen you see that that that mentality is got to be broken by the revelation of the hour amen he needs to stay humble all the time he needs to be dependent on God all the time he needs to be thankful for the grace of God all the time but at some point he's got to get up and say I can't help it this is what God's called me to do and if he's called me to do he's got to empower me to do it until it's not me doing it it's him doing it through me and that takes faith if you turn with me back to judges I want to look in the Book of Judges chapter 6 in verse 11 judges chap 6: 11 is a story of Gideon and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was an ofra that pertaineth to joash the eite and his son Gideon threshing Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee and he said unto them oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man you know Gideon the angel of the Lord I love this calls him a mighty man of Valor before Gideon realized he was a mighty man of Valor when the angel spoke to him the angel spoke his position by predestination but he wasn't speaking his position in that day because this Mighty Man of Valor was threshing Wheat by The Wine Press hiding it from the midianites so they wouldn't come and take it away he wasn't Brave he wasn't bold he wasn't a warrior he he was hiding threshing out a little bit of wheat so he could have a little bit of food so the midianites couldn't take it away but the angel come and dressed him from a Heavenly perspective amen but Gideon answered back from an Earthly perspective thou Mighty Man of Valor and he says uh uh he says the Lord be with you he says if the Lord be with us where are all his miracles and why has the Lord forsaken us and what's going on I mean he's in a bad spot nothing's working out right they're in trouble amen they're under the judgments of God and now he he he's not automatically believing it his condition is such he's saying what do you mean the Lord Lord be with if the Lord be with us where are all his miracles why why has all this befallen us and he says you know go in thy might and save Israel from the hand of the midianites and he says wait a minute wait wait a minute how shall I save Israel I'm of a poor family in Manasseh and I'm the least in my father's house now this is the way he sees himself but what he needs to get is he needs to get a little bit of that heavenly vision and go back to what the angel said and the angel said behold thou mighty man of Valor that's the predestinated word of God over his life that's why we've had an angel in this day say thou art the Spotless sinless spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ oh my goodness I don't think we should ever lose our littleness I don't think we should ever forget that we're just flesh I don't think we should ever forget that without God we're nothing but I also don't think we should ever forget what the angel said God's perspective and God's Vision amen what God has made clean how can we call unclean what God has equipped how can we say is unequipped what God has empowered can we say has no power our life is a paradox amen when God was going to call uh the Apostle Paul he was Saul at this time Saul was wrapped up in his own ER arance and his own pride and his own understanding and ability and education and all the things that Earth could offer and he thought he had a position and he thought he was smart and he thought he was skilled thought he was well trained and he thought he was well equipped he had it all going for him but he had an encounter with a living breathing Jesus Christ the pillar of fire and in that encounter he realized he didn't have anything he didn't know anything he had no strength had no power had nothing he was brought down to the dust and humbled but but God didn't humble him to keep him there amen God humbled him so that he would realize he's nothing he would count everything as D but God told uh uh God told uh the prophet he says he's a chosen vessel unto me God brought him down so God could bring him up amen sometimes we have to come and we have to face our sin we have to face what we really are sometimes amen we have to face face our failures face the the hidden sin in our life face the how wretched and how miserable and how wrong we've been but not so that we can stay there so that we can repent so that we can acknowledge that we're nothing without him so that he can pick us up and put us in his ordained position for us we cannot always wallow in past sins we can't always be inhibited because we failed in the past we did fail in the past we all failed in the past we had to fail in the past to to know what we are in the flesh it's important for us to know and to remember what we are on our own but we can't stay there at some point we have to recognize that he chose me I didn't choose him he ordained me I didn't ordain me he's empowered me I didn't Empower me and he's got something for me to do and if he's called me to do it I can do it this is what the Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 and this is the attitude that I want to take from it in 1 Corinthians 15:9 he says for I am least of the Apostles that I am not meat that means worthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God but by the grace of God I am what I am oh if you want to take away anything from tonight I hope that you can take this away you can say I'm not worthy to be bride of Jesus Christ I'm not worthy to be the elect seed of God I'm not worthy to be the sinless Spotless virtuous bride I'm not worthy of that position I'm not worthy of that title amen there's nothing in me that makes me worthy I'm not worthy I'm not I'm not worthy to see the back part of God's mind unveiled I'm not worthy to have the revelation of the Mysteries I'm not worthy of any of that because I was wrong and I did wrong and I thought wrong and I acted wrong and I did it on purpose I'm not worthy for any of that I sinned willfully and I sinned by premeditation and I I did everything that you could possibly do wrong I'm not worthy for this position but I'll tell you one thing by the grace of God I am what I am and I can't change what I am amen that's what gave Paul the power to do signs and wonders and move in the ministry and stand in the face of all kinds of opposition not because he was constantly remembering his littleness but because he was remembering the position God put him in his predestinated position the way God called him and what God thought of him and what he was doing by the power of God some point we have to we have to move beyond the barrier of our own thinking yes and move into God's thinking Jesus said with me all things are possible I am the vine you are the branches without me you can do nothing but with him all things are possible friends you can preach you can teach you can testify you can lay hands on the sick you can every gift is available in the body you can have service you can can you can you can do anything God leads you to do as he empowers you to do it because he's ordained for you to do something for the kingdom of God to be a witness to to serve in your position to serve in your place wherever you're at God's called you to it and he already foresaw you doing it we don't have to live in doubt we can live in faith we know the the famous story of Esau and Jacob when we go to this all the time when we talk about this subject but I I I want to spend a minute here in Romans chapter 9 if we could turn to Romans chapter 9 together I think it's fitting that we look at this again Romans chapter 9 verse 7 said neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh the these are not the children of God but the children of Promise are counted for seed for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at that this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what could Jacob do to earn God's love he already had it before before he was born before he could do good or evil he said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated brother BM tells us and I think it's very very interesting he says Esau was twice the guy that Jacob was I love I'm so glad God sent a prophet Esau was twice the guy that Jacob was when it came to being a man taking care of his old blind Daddy and everything else and Jacob was a little Shyer hung around his mother's apron little old boy but God said I love Jacob and refuse Esau before either boy was born Romans 8 says so that's exactly right God knows what's in a man he goes on to say in the SMY and church age he out of the church age book he says before I close this subject I know there's a question in your mind you want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence I don't believe in the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls be careful here see this it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed now we're getting to the heart of the matter amen God is Not so much looking at your flesh he knew what flesh you would fall in he knew what color eyes you would have he knew what color hair but that wasn't it he wasn't this that he's looking after that's why you can be the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ because the seed in the soul never sinned in the first place the real you that was intended to be you from the beginning before it fell into uh into corruption before it had to come through a tabernacle that was born in corruption before all of that you should have come the right way in a tabernacle of Flesh that had no corruption and then you would have never sinned you would have never had a problem you would have never failed yes so what is God predestinacion have I loved but Esau have I hated and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed that's why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God if you are true seed you will hear the that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you what's he saying why was it Jacob wanted the birthright because he had a seat of God on the inside it wasn't because Jacob you know calculated and figured out and did a Bible study and no there was something else driving him he had to have the birthright and even though he got it through deception and through means I mean sometimes you think how in the world can God even honor he was lying to his father he was coming in deception to get the birthright I he got the birthright by not even being very generous with his brother his brother was starving to the point of famishing to the point of fainting and dying and he was so hungry he said would you give me something to eat you think a real Christian a real seed of God would just give his brother I mean a bowl of lentils how much did that cost him yeah but he sees the opportunity and said I've got to get the birth right because the birth right was the lineage of Christ the birth right was the promise the birthright was was the effect of the word in that day amen and he was looking at more than just the birthright something in him was driving him he had to have it amen just like there's something in us that's driving us to this word this word is everything it's beyond my comprehension beyond my understanding not because of study but something in me is driving me to Christ and you think how can God bless Jacob and when he did something like that and then when he went to get the blessing which he was for ordained to receive he does so by lying to his father I mean if Jacob was in our church I he would probably be under church discipline right I mean he certainly probably wouldn't be your friend after you've seen what he did to his brother and to his father yes and if a man can treat his own family that way and we know Jacob had to have a conversion he had to meet the angel he had to be changed is what we we understand all of that but the prophet of God takes us a little deeper and says there was something driving him from the inside it was the seat of God it wasn't because he was the better man it wasn't because he was the nicer it wasn't because he was the sweetest it was he had all of this in his background he had all of this in his past amen and there would be an encounter with an angel that would change him and he would walk differently from then on and all of us with all of our past and all of our wrongs and all of our conniving we had to come and meet the angel of the Lord ourselves we had to come in contact with Christ himself and had to change our walk from that day on and from then that day on you don't see him acting that way anymore but it didn't change the fact that from the very beginning he was chosen of God and loved by God and Esau was hated Jacob was loved Esau was hated and neither one had done a good or bad deed oh we got to get beyond the human thinking and say God I'm so glad that you chose me because I had no chance no opportunity no way but if you've chose me and you've called me then I'll do what you called me to do I'll be a witness even though I don't think I'm a good one I'll testify even though I don't think I know how I'll Shine the Light even though I think I've been too polluted and doo dirty and doo corrupted in the past I'll still do it yes why because you called me to do it yes in John 4:4 the Bible says and he must needs go through Samaria we know this so well why did he need to go through Samaria what what was drawing him to Samaria area they had some nice people down there that were friendly and sweet and were living a good Christian Life waiting for the Messiah to come no there was a harlot down there a prostitute that had lived an unclean life she had had five husbands before and the one man she was living with now was not her own husband it was somebody else's but regardless of her immorality he had needs to go buy Samar listen you were in Samaria I was in Samaria and it may not have been immorality as far as fornication and adultery but we were steeped in something we had something and he had need go by Samaria not for a nice person not for a sweet face not for an upstanding citizen he had need to go by and and find a predestinated seed brother B said and they identified Christ of all ages he said now in the E bad women and good women can't associate together it's different here but they can't there she is marked she's marked that's all if she ever has the wrong husband she ain't no more associated with it's all messed together here now we find out but there it wasn't so she couldn't come with the virgins of the morning she had to come about noon to get her water so she started to let down the water pot but there was a predestinated seed in that little woman she let down that water pot and she heard a man say give me a drink bring me a drink he knew just when to get to the well not when all the clean living virgins who have kept them themselves not when they showed up you know what he wasn't just seeking out prostitutes it wasn't like he said I need to find me a pro no he was seeking the predestinated seed regardless of the condition if it was a tax collector who was corrupt and stealing amen if it was a prostitute if it was a religious zealot if it was a fisherman if it was somebody who had lived good if it was somebody who lived bad it didn't matter the background it didn't matter the past it didn't matter the present condition he wasn't seeking them out for any of those reasons he was seeking them out because there was a seed on the inside that had to come to life in that day because he had ordained for that seed to bear fruit and he didn't come to you for any other reason he never came your way and revealed himself to you for any reason but the fact that you were a predestinated seed and he didn't call you forth just so you could say I was a predestinated seed but he has ordained you unto good works Amen to serve him not to feel like you're no good and unworthy and can never do something that's the truth but let's get a Heavenly P perspective and hear what the angel said we are here yeah we realize what we are without Christ absolutely that's healthy but we also must realize what we are in Christ that's healthy too we're weak outside of Christ we're Invincible in Christ we're helpless outside of Christ but we're here to help the world inside of Christ we have no answers outside of Christ we have all the answers inside of Christ Our Life is a paradox it just depends on which perspective we choose to look from and whether we're going to Live From the Inside Man or the outside man and it's time to move beyond the outside man and Live From the Inside Man understanding that the outside man is nothing but by the grace of God I am what I am praise God uh there was an interview that brother Brenham did he did lots of private interviews but to the best of my understanding there's only ever one that's been recorded and I may be wrong on that but I don't I don't know that I am at least in the table I only see one and and and of all the hundreds and maybe thousands of interviews private interviews brother brandham did I think it's amazing God only allowed one to come through to us and I think for our sakes here today this must have been the most important one not that others weren't important and that God didn't answer important questions in them and he didn't help people but there must be a reason why God allowed this private interview to slip through it must be something we need today and you know it as the private interview with sister Bruce sister Georgia Bruce and I'm not going to read all of it I'm just going to read a few excerts out of it amen because it help helped me so much and sister Bruce is so much like most of us she's so in tune with her failure she's so in tune with her mistakes and she comes and she's sick and she's in need of healing but that's not her main concern she comes because she needs to be prayed for but she says brother brandom most of all I want the experience that I've been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your heart she wants to know that she's right with God and that she's she's she goes I want the experience that I've been sealed in the Holy Ghost and she wants God to reveal it to brother Brandon she wants to know she's in this private interview CU she's sick she has a heart condition she's going to die if God doesn't heal her and this is one of her main questions and brother B says I believe with all my heart that you are a real born-again believer sister Bruce I love that he just just immediately Comforts her and then he goes to explain why she's wavering he doesn't dechristianize her he doesn't tell her she's of little faith he doesn't he starts to explain to her that she'll understand why she she's having problems says he he first he says I believe with all my heart that you are a real born- again believer sister Bruce how could that Spirit just leave then here's the explanation when you get sick you get weary and you're a nervous type person and sister Bruce says yes I'm so thankful brother brandom can deal with people where they're at and not requiring everybody's the same way some people struggle with the question of unworthiness and God can never use some of us don't that some of us worry and get nervous some of us don't but here's a sister who when she gets gets sick she gets weary she gets nervous and she says yes and you get things on your mind see little bitty things and it just keeps building up both ways he's talking about in the positive and the negative you'll get somebody on your heart you want to pray for them get up and pray for it you can't rest till you get that person prayed for that's you then take on the other side Satan Maybe Might present something to you and and out this way and then you're a nature and God works and Satan works and then Satan tries to make you believe that you are not see you keep building this and maybe this and this and what brother R is saying is because you're a nervous type person God uses that but the Satan tries to take advantage of that too and you get something on your mind and you can't get it off your heart and if God puts on your heart somebody to pray for you just can't rest till you get up and pray for that person but then the devil puts into your heart that maybe you're not maybe you're not born again maybe you're not right with God and then he and this is what he says then then he tries to make you believe that you're not you keep building this and maybe this and this she keeps thinking and adding reasons why maybe she's not has anybody ever done that before he said see don't look at yourself sister Bruce you're looking at the wrong picture you're looking at the corruptible you're looking at what was swn in corruption you're looking at the Hybrid you're looking at the result of the Fall you're looking at the one we struggle with you're looking at your worst enemy don't look at yourself look at Christ and what he purchased for you so brother B begins to talk about praying he's trying trying to build her faith and he goes in a little bit sort to explain to her how he's not worthy to pray for her but but but God has made him worthy he said me being a sinner I'm not worthy he says but the blood of Christ and under the blood of Christ I'm not a sinner anymore so he's talking about praying for he says he says now but I come to represent him I'm not him but I come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christian and he says again I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman and listen how strong this battle is after he says that she says I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times you see the war that's raging in her mind and this is what he says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you see he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him and she says yes said all right that's what he died for so you could serve him your mist Stakes are not looked not lotted to you he's your propitiation he's your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins became you because your desire is to serve him why did Christ die so that I could serve him with all my mistakes with all my fails with all my weaknesses he died to cover all of that so that I could serve him and then this this is what sister Bruce says next but I've never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on it's not that she didn't have an experience it doesn't that she wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost is that she had nothing that she could put her foot on she didn't have anything tangible that she could go back and put her foot on he said all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come through the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce says yes he said that was your nature it changed once but what changed it she says Christ he said there you are sister that's it that's the answer what's the answer that's the answer you come into this world one way but something happened to every one of us who've been born again by the spirit of God something changed that that nature that was rebellious our heart wanted to go our own way something changed us what changed us it was Christ he goes there you are she was tangled up in her mind she was struggling not because she hadn't lived a Christian Life brother Brenham tells her he says as far as I know there's nothing in your life and it's if it is God's hid it from me but I as your Shepherd have watched your life sister and you're a genuine true Christian she had been living for years as a Christian but she has this weakness in her flesh that when she gets sick when she gets weary she gets nervous and the devil starts putting thoughts in her mind and she starts adding this to this to this and she just starts to believe that maybe she's not it but brother bram's here confirming you're a genuine Christian I believe you to be born of the spirit and she's still debating with the prophet amen you would think that you would go sit in a private interview with brother Brandon and you say I just don't have I I don't know I want to experience I've been filled with the Holy Ghost he says I believe you to be a genuine Christian sister Bruce I believe you to be really a born- again Christian you be like amen and walk away no she's going but and again he says but look it's your desires your desires is right and Christ died for but but this and this but but I make so many mistakes that's why Christ died but I don't have any definite experience I put my foot on but listen you've changed Heaven you yes who Chang you Christ what is it that's it just move on Amen just trust God just serve God and believe what God has done for us amen the devil tries to keep us on first base all the time stuck on first base I don't know this and I don't know that listen if there's not been a change in your life if you've never encountered God you seek God until something dramatic Something Something Real has happened in your life do you know something changed in you something broke away something old and something new has come to life and you just keep serving God from that day on but don't go back and readdress it and readdress it and readdress it and re dressing amen you're going to be stuck what God wants us to do is go on into adoption amen move from there all the way up into maturity to take a position to serve God to be his witness on this Earth we've got to have an experience but the experience is a changed life yes that's right we've got to move from there there's work for us to do there's things for us to accomplish there's works that he wants to do in our Liv we're ordained to do something for the kingdom of God and we've got to have faith that if God ordained me to do it I can do it not me but Christ that dwelleth in me I want to read one more scripture and then we'll we'll stop for tonight 1 Corinthians let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 1 1 Corinthians chapter 1 vers 26 in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 26 it says for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and the base things of the world and the things which are despised have God chosen yay in the things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are you in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord amen let's all stand if we Glory let's glory in the Lord because it's not what I've done but it's what he's ordained and it's not what I'm doing but what Christ is doing in me he hasn't chose many mighty many powerful many great think about the prophet he chose in the end time he chose a man with a seventh grade education whose daddy was a bootlegger whose parents were Sinners is that what he chose yes he chose was uneducated unrefined unsophisticated and when God called him into the ministry amen he was a lineman for the power company and he worked as a game warden when he chose the man to have the Keys of the Kingdom he was a fisherman when he chose a temp maker a fisherman a tax collector my goodness why couldn't he use you and me why wouldn't he use you and I if it's always been the hard Harlot and the poorest in manasse and the least in the family if it was the youngest Shepherd boy it was it was the little comely shepher boy what makes us think that he can't use us amen what gets us what makes us think that we're so low down or we're so backward or we're so defeated or we're so weak my goodness he takes the weak things to confound the strong he takes the things that are based to confound the things that are Mighty if we think we're nothing then I'm eligible to be used by God to confound the world amen amen when God called me to preach I was an air compressor mechanic most people don't even know what an air compressor mechanic is there's so few in the world but I come home from work every day from Grease from from my head to my toe I took toolbox in and I fix stuff every day amen I I got through high school because I went to vocational school I was so bored with school I went to vocational school for electronics to get through school I'm a second semester College Drop drop out they say you have any college education I say yes I made it through the first semester I have a little college education but God it's it's none of that is what he's looking for he's just looking for a willing vessel that he can take and despite all the past tragedy and all the failures and all the weakness that he can take that and do things that will confound everybody around us amen amen nobody could preach like brother brandham that's right has seventh grade education if God can do that for that man what can he do for you and I if God could take that man around and around the world with healing campaigns if he could preach the thousands out of time if he could have half a million people in a meeting if he could have 30,000 conversions in one setting and he coming out of Kentucky he was despised and rejected with no formal education and no support why can't God use me to witness to my neighbor why can't God shine his light through me where I work why can't God use me to bless my brothers and sisters why can't I serve some place in the body what's different there's no difference we have to get past our own thinking and allow God to be God and allow God to have a purpose in our life because I tell you if you're a c Gene of God I'll tell you this before he formed you in the belly of your mother he knew you and he ordained you to be something in this world to be his witness to be his bride I say God God help me get past my own limited vision and let me see the way you see I want to be like Gideon though I'm least and though I'm the less you can do something through me that I can never do myself say God help us man let's just bow our heads and pray together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for this day you've given us God we thank you for the reflection and the memory of what you did through our brother Steve God we're all benefactors of a brother that you ordained to serve you but God he wasn't the only one that was ordained to serve the body ordained to do a work that you've called us to in this age but God you've ordained each one of us to something to be a witness to be a light to serve a purpose and the devil would love Lord to trip us up and cause us to make mistakes and feel ourselves incapable and unable and unworthy but God you answered the worthiness question when you hung on Calvary we're not worthy by our Merit but by your choosing and those who you chose you shed Your Precious Blood to cleanse to clean to free from the bondage of sin youve set us free Lord free to serve free to work free to move forward in this great gospel God I pray those that struggle with these questions those that struggle to believe that they are precious in your sight that they are accepted in the Beloved that they have a purpose in this life and that that you've given them something to do I pray that you would break through that now Lord just break that yoke break through that barrier Lord so that we can come to see ourselves the the way you see us that we can move forward by your grace Lord not because we're worthy as the Apostle Paul would say Lord not I'm not worthy to be an apostle by the grace of God I am what I am God I pray that you go to each heart right now and you would awaken the reality of your call in our lives we can say I'm not worthy to be your bride I'm not worthy to shine your light I'm not worthy to carry your truth truth but by the grace of God I am what I am help us Lord to walk in this life with that realization and help us to go Forward Unto the fullness of adoption and declaim the fullness of redemption we love you father we thank you for today we thank you Lord in this Thanksgiving season we have so much to be thankful for thankful for our Salvation thankful for this message thankful for the truth which sets us free I pray Lord that we can go forward this weekend thankful that we are free free of condemnation free of thoughts Lord that would bind us and hold us back you've set us free Lord for that we give you thanks and praise we commit ourselves to you aesh and ask that you would use us Lord use us like never before give us the boldness that Peter and John had in the face of all opposition boldness to know that you've called us equipped us you've sent us out as lights into this world and may we go forth bearing that light we ask that you would help us Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen will I know that I am nothing to Bear the Christian name for every blunder that I make I've just myself to blame but Glory Hallelujah I don't see them at all and neither does my savior for the blood has cleansed them all in him in him it's the only place for me I won't go back for any to where I used to be the sun is always shining and the Victory been won I'm walking in the light of that New Jerusalem and it doesn't seem to matter how this old flesh may feel let every man's word be alive God's word alone is real oh how my heart's rejoicing it's all in him not Fe and the glory is to him alone throughout eternity in him in him it's the only place for me I won't go back for anything to where I used to be the sun is always shining and the victory's been won and I'm walking in the light of that New Jerusalem verse three well it doesn't seem to matter how this old flesh may feel let every man's word be AE God's word alone is real oh how my heart's rejoicing it's all in him not me and the glory is to him alone throughout eternity in him in him it's the only place for me I won't go back for anything to where I used to be the sun is always shining and the Victory been won and I'm walking in the light of that New Jerusalem will I know that I'm I am nothing to Bear the Christian name for every blunder that I make I'm just myself to blame but Glory huah I don't see them at all and neither does my savior for the blood has cleansed them all in his in him the only place for me I will go back for anything to where I used to be the sun is always shining and the Victory been one and I'm walking in the light of that New Jerusalem I'm walking I'm walking in the light of that New [Music] Jerusalem
