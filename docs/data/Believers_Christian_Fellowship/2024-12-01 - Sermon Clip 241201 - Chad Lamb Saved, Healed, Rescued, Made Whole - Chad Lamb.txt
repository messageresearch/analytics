========================================

now I find myself in this last days with the many of the believing Christians identified in his ministry he is the same yesterday today and forever I find myself in this day identified in his ministry do you find yourself that way believing it walking in it amen notice the works that he did he said the believer would do the same thing the works that I do shall you do also then can you be identified with him then when the reproach comes on the word Can You Stand The reproach like he did see identified with him I was identified with him brother BR goes on and he goes example after example and and listen you you you you read these things and what what is he saying it sounds so extreme but the reality is if I am part of God I am part of God and wherever God was I was there too because I have representation there because what God is amen and what I am are not two separate things I'm certainly not fullness but a little measure is still part of God part of Jesus Christ part of the word to be the bride you have to be part of the word and wherever the word was you had part in that and this message came to break our spiritual Amnesia to recognize where you can say I was with the Hebrew Chen I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace how I don't have conscience of it I didn't see anything I can't describe it to you but whatever is alive in me now was there whatever power is working and me was there rescuing them bringing through because it was the fourth man it was Christ and if you're part of Christ and Christ is you and you're in Christ then you were there why because whatever was there is in [Music] you amen Were You There When the sons of God shot her for Joy I don't remember it I don't have consciousness of it I can't describe it to you but something inside of me jumps up and down and says amen when I hear the prophet say that why because brother bham said they were shouting for Joy when he showed them his Plan of Redemption and we're in the day when he's taken the veil off his Plan of Redemption and I'm shouting for Joy today at the same thing I shouted for joy in that day if I can rejoice in the opening of the seals the peeling back of the entire mystery of redemption and shout and clap my hands then I certainly can believe I did it there when I was with him there he said to be a true Christian you you have to identify yourself there you see that's a pretty big leap it's a leap that only faith can make human mind can't make that leap it's impossible
