Jesus set me free. You ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just tell you why. Because my sins are gone. And when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are, I say, "My sins are gone. They're underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary. as far removed as darkness is from God. In the sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God, my sins are gone. Was at the old time altar where God came in my heart and now my sins are gone. The Lord took full possession. The devil did. I'm glad my sins are gone. Well, they are underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darknesses from God in the sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. When Satan comes to tempt me and tries to make me down, I say my sins are gone. You got me into trouble, but Jesus got me out. I'm glad my sins are gone. Oh, they are underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary. as far removed as darkness is from God. In the sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. I'm living now for Jesus. I'm happy night and day because my sins are gone. My soul is filled with music. With all my heart I sing. Yes, I know my sins are gone. Oh, they're underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from God in the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone.

I want to do thy will, oh Lord. Amen. God bless you all. We're going to let you have your seats for just a minute. We got some announcements to make. Thank you, musicians. You can you can be excused. Uh I just want to remind you that uh brother Gabe Smith is in Dton again this morning preaching, so we don't want to forget him. And also I wanted to say I enjoyed the reception yesterday for brother Wesley and sister Anne. It was good to have them here and uh appreciate uh uh sister Tanya and all the work and her and her staff of helpers put together. They had a beautiful reception and I'm excited for the Godfree family. And also it was nice to have Ann's parents come and join us and to have us in service. So God bless you. It's good to have you guys here with us this morning. So it's been nice as we got to see you there and we got to see you here. So that's been really good. Amen. And so we enjoy having them here and we're excited for their future. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, we have some visitors here from the UK. There was two sisters that were traveling into the US from UK and they decided to stop and join us for the service. Sister Jane and Sister Becky, where are you all back here? God bless you. It's good to have you in the service and welcome. And I'm glad you included us in your itinerary while here in the United States. That's nice. There's also a family visiting with the small family here. Brother Ben and his family back over here. God bless you. It's good to have you all here again this morning. And any other visitors, we we appreciate you joining us. We want you to feel very welcome and at home. And also, I wanted to let you know that uh brother Franco and sister Amy and Pipa along with uh Vidy and and Maria have traveled to Italy. So, this is the trip that the church has part at least partially gifted for brother Franco for his 30 years of service. So, I just want us all to remember them in prayer. We just want to ask God's blessings to shower upon them and that everything would work out perfect because this is part of a thank you from us to him and for brother Franco and Sister Amy and for all they've done. And so, I I've been praying that God would just make it a wonderful time for them. They got quite a fam a bit of family they're going to visit. They haven't seen for a really long time. Pipa's never met some of her family. They're in Italy. Sister Maria is going to get to spend time with her brother. And so I just pray it's a marvelous, wonderful, perfect trip &gt;&gt; that everything goes well for our brother. He's never they they those two have never missed this many services and been gone this long. And they planned it over retreat so that they wouldn't miss services here cuz that's how faithful they are that they're going to miss the retreat that they would like to be at, but they they want to be at their post of duty and doing what they're supposed to do. So it was a bit of arm twisting to get them to go and miss this many services, but we're just thankful. So they have been absolutely faithful for 30 years. But also I want to thank the crew that they left behind to help them because I can't do this by myself. It's impossible. So sister Nita Hatfield, she's running the video things today and brother Anthony Golden, they've been helping them for quite a while now learning the ropes. But recently, Brother Sam Pittenberger has been joining upstairs to help with the video and so he's been helping as well. And then very recently, brother Peter Brooks joined the team and uh he did my PowerPoint this morning. He probably wishes I didn't tell you now in case something goes wrong, but if anything goes wrong, it's my fault, not his. He probably would rather I tell you afterwards, but anyways, cuz Frank always takes my notes and converts them to a PowerPoint in the morning and and I emailed those and and Peter took care of it for us. So, God bless you and thank you. So, I appreciate all those who are jumping in to help out and and make it work and and I'm I'm so grateful and so grateful they were able to take the pressure off brother Frank and sister Amy so that they could go and so just remember them in prayer. Also, uh the retreat will be this Thursday. We start we meet over there. The service will be at 7 and we will not have Wednesday night service here that Wednesday night's canceled. We'll be meeting over there on Thursday. And also, brother Daniel White and his family will be coming in. And so just pray for them that their travels all work out well coming and going. And uh I had been with Daniel, you know, about two years ago uh when my girls and I traveled over there. And he was just sharing with me some things he had been teaching his church on families and relationships and and the inner workings of relationships. And as he described it to me, I just really enjoyed his approach. I enjoyed his insight and and the way that he ministered. So I said, "Would you come and do our retreat?" and I told him kind of what it was and he agreed. I thank God he agreed he's coming and so I didn't tell him what to preach but I told him I liked when he preached that. So I kind of think that's what he's going to cover and we've had some conversation but he hasn't told me all the details but you know all of us are part of relationships part of families in one way or another and and we have relationship with each other and and his insight I found to be just really good really helpful and good teaching. So I told him I want him to come and relax, which for Daniel that's not a problem. He's good at being relaxed. The Australians are good at being relaxed. You know, they say it come right mate. And to slow that down for us here in America, it'll come out all right, friend. But they shorten everything because they're so relaxed. They don't even speak in full sentences. It'll come right me. So I told him just to relax, just take his time. It's a casual setting and just for us to enjoy. And so just come expecting, amen, for God to teach us, amen, to instruct us on some of the things in our lives. So I'm looking forward to that and for having him here with us. Plus, his accent is just really cool to listen to. So amen. So yeah, we'll be looking forward to that this weekend and just keep that in prayer as well that everybody travels there and everything works out well. And God has certainly blessed us the last two times we've been. We thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm very much looking forward to sharing that time together again. And then there was one more thing that I wanted to share with you. I think um most of you may have heard but not all that brother Ed Bisll had passed away this past Wednesday. So he passed away Wednesday evening and I just wanted to share just a few pictures. Brother, brother Bisco, and I'm sure there's churches all over the world that are going to be saying something today. But brother Ed Biscoll was a special brother. Very special brother. The Lord used him mightily. He had quite a ministry for a long time. He was quite a witness of the things that he had saw and heard in Brother Ram's ministry, but he was able to carry on. It wasn't just that he was a witness. He was able to take the the the revelation that Brother Bram delivered and he was able to carry it on. and he did so much work around the world and we just really respect our brother and admire him and uh he was an inspiration to me. There's many things that he preached that just absolutely were so fantastic and uh so helpful to me. But as far as the Lima area, Brother Biscll's been instrumental in this area from the very beginning. He was instrumental when when the message was coming to Lima and just beginning to form and instrumental in the forming of the first church here as the saints were gathering together. Some of you were there, some of you remember it. I know uh I know the Woods were there, Brother Dave and Sister Bessie, and they remember a lot of that. And so he just has quite a tie in with us here. And also, he did quite a bit of traveling with Brother Lonnie. Brother Lonnie and him together did a lot of work around the world. And brother Ed's been a part of our camps here in 1999. He was part of our family camp. He he came back again in 2005 and they were in the studio there doing Global Answers. And then this picture we have here is when he was here in 2015. Many of you remember we had our uh I think it was the 25th anniversary of the church and he came to preach those meetings and they were fantastic. Amen. And I I was so blessed and that's when I really had more personal contact with him on that trip there and and he was such a gentleman, so kind and uh he and his family interacted with my family and and I just I I thank God that God had such a gentleman, such a such a figure, such a ministry, such a gift that he gave to us. And I feel a loss. uh and and he hasn't been ministering for a while because uh he's not been able to. I think he was 90 years old when he passed away. So, we were feeling that loss as his ministry declined. But now that he's gone, it feels like we've lost something. But, you know, in the kingdom of God, there is no losing &gt;&gt; because we're going to meet our brother again. Amen. And he's gone to a reward. And I I pray that I believe that he's having a a wonderful time that he would never come back. But, uh we feel the loss. And I just pray that God will help us to carry on with the message. And I just want to pray for his family. I want to pray for sister Ruth and the family and like to also pray for their church. So if we could stand this morning and I'd like as a congregation for us to just pray for them and just remember them this morning. Let's bow our heads together. Dear heavenly father, we thank you Lord Jesus for gathering us here together again, for drawing us, Lord. for no man can come to you unless you draw them. We're so thankful, God, that you've been constant in our lives, that you have sustained us and you've healed us and you've kept us and you keep bringing us back again. And we know that it's your abundant grace in our lives. And Lord, as we reflect on the life of our brother Bisco, Lord, and the impact that he's had on each one of us in different ways, me personally, Lord, he was such a gentleman, so kind and encouraging, and I just appreciate that, Lord. I appreciate the work that you did through him. And we just pray, God, that we would be vessels that you could work through, that we would surrender our lives to you. And God, as we stand here together this morning, we just remember Sister Ruth. And we ask that you'd be with her, Lord. That you would comfort her, Lord, with a very special comfort. May it be tangible. May she feel your presence and and your embrace. May you comfort her and the rest of the family, his children and and his uh grandchildren and great and great great great grandchildren. May you bless all of them and the assembly, Lord, also at Cloverdale Bible Way. Would you just comfort them, Lord, as no doubt they feel such a loss and losing their pastor so long, Lord? And I just pray, Lord, that you would comfort them and you would bless them. And may they also continue on in the word, Lord. May the legacy of our brother, what's left behind in the memory is his passion and love for the truth that inspired us to have a passion and love for your truth. And may we honor his memory by continuing on in the thing that he loved moving forward progressing in this message. And God, may we each one do our part as well. We ask that you would bless this service this morning. that I pray you take this vessel of mine under your control and that you'd speak through these lips, Lord, your eternal words, Lord, words of life. That you would plant them in our hearts and that we would forever be changed. God, we come, Lord, not out of tradition. We don't come, Lord, for a ceremony, but we come to meet with you. We come to hear from you. We come to be changed by the word that you sew in our hearts, Lord. We come to grow. We come to be shaved down. We come to be shaped and molded into your very image for this hour. And I pray that you would do that work in us now as we gather. May you have preeminence among us. May you move as you wish as we surrender to you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's uh take our Bibles and turn to the book of Revelation. While we're standing together, let's look at Revelation chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10 uh and verse 7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants, the prophets. Amen. and God bless you as you have your seat. Amen. This is um scripture we're familiar with. We've been reading it a lot. We've been reading it a lot since we came to the message &gt;&gt; because this has to do with the day and age we live in. The purpose of the message and why God sent a prophet and it means so much to us. Amen. So, it seems like I I don't mean to become routine or to get into habits or become boring in any way, but it seems like every service we either have to start in Genesis or Revelation because they're just connected. It's alpha and omega and we see the seed in the seed and and it has everything to do with where we are. But if we could pull up the PowerPoint, please, we can see uh I've been we've been preaching during a certain theme, you know, with pick up your pen and write. And it's led us into a certain stream and and I want to continue on with that this uh this morning. And I want to preach on a super sign. And I just see some things that Brother Rem said about that and how it relates to us. And and when I looked at this, I just got so excited. I just I I can't help it. I just get so thrilled. I mean, when when you think of Bible days are here again. We're living in the fulfillment of prophecy. And it's not to me, it's not just that I'm living and I've seen prophecy over there and I've seen prophecy over there. But the realization keeps coming that I am the prophecy. That I'm in the prophecy. I'm not I'm not walking near it. I'm not seeing it a far off. I've not observed it. But that prophecy has everything to do with my purpose on this earth. And I'm not only connected to it and it's connected to me, but that prophecy is actually being fulfilled in me. Uh and and and what's different in this day than it was when God sent John the Baptist or God sent, you know, Malachi 4 is that prophecy was all wrapped up in that one individual. But now this prophecy is fulfilled in a many membered body. And so may I only may have a portion of that. I only may have a dropper full, but it doesn't change anything. I'm part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not all wrapped up in me. I'm not all of it. I can't express it all. I can't even I can't even manifest it all. Amen. But whatever portion I am, Amen. I'm part of that word. Amen. I'm part of that prophecy to be fulfilled. And that's the realization that keeps coming. And when we say things like that, I mean, there's something inside of us that just responds because we've been eternally connected to this word. But then there's something that can take place in the outer man in our mind and say, "How can I say I'm the word? How can I say I'm part of the prophecy?" Because it's not me, but it's that part of me that's in me that was meant to be me. That part that was in the mind of God, the child of God, that's buried in my soul that's come to life by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost. That's the me I'm talking about. I'm not talking about this me that was born of mom and dad. That thing's corrupt. That thing's vile. It has to come under control of the Holy Ghost and will eventually be changed in the atoms completely. &gt;&gt; But when I say me, I'm not talking about this me because this me is there's nothing good there. And this me fails all the time and this me is still uh living in a in a in a in a cockleber shell. Amen. That that's me. But there's another me that's growing on the inside that is part of this word because it comes from the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that realization is coming. We've known it. We talk about it. We've talked about it for decades. Amen. But it's becoming more of a realization in our lives. And I wanted to listen, this is my desire. And I'm just going to shoot shoot from the hip and hit it right between the eyes starting off. I want this revelation to move to a manifestation &gt;&gt; because we've had the revelation and the revelation is still growing. God is still unfolding the revelation. But this revelation must become a manifestation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's my great desire is to allow that revelation in my life to be a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we look here at the message shalom said we heard the word say that in the days of the seventh angel in the church age, he just said the seventh angel's message would be the last message. And then oh, we find out over here in Revelation 10, in the days of the message of the seventh angel, the mysteries of God should be finished. the seventh seal would be pulled back. Amen. It should be there. Then all at once when it's happening, a vision broke said go to Tucson and a great noise will take place at this time. So you'll be thoroughly understanding and know that it's sent. It'll just shake the earth nearly. All of you know about it. It's on tape months before it happened. Then it happened. Then appeared in the sky. Shalom. What appeared in the sky? A cloud. &gt;&gt; What was that cloud? Shalom. It was a greeting. Peace. All is well. Good morning. Amen. Shalom. What is it? It's a changing beats. The sympathy or or the symphony is what brother was talking about. He's talking about and in and shalom. He tells a story of this great symphony. And he's talking about the symphony of Peter and the wolf, the Russian symphony that's played out in music. And and he says they act out the parts through the different beating of the drums and the playing of the clarinet and the obo and all these other parts. Amen. And he and he's talking about the great symphony of God is spelling out something. It's playing. It's coming to a conclusion. And the great writer wrote it and the great conductor is conducting it. And it's all telling the story dramatizing through the lives of individuals. Amen. Through this end time, dramatizing God's great mystery plan. &gt;&gt; But he says, "What is it? What is this uh uh mystery of God should be finished? That the seventh seal would be pulled back in this day." And he said, "When it was ready to happen," Amen. I got a I got a vision. and I was told to go to Tucson. Why? Because it's time for the seven seal to be pulled back, &gt;&gt; for the mystery to be revealed. And he said, "What is it?" It's a changing beats. It changed from church ages now to to the bride age and the seventh seal. It changed from working through denominations and working through systems to God himself working in his people on an individual level. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to back up a little bit and look here at this prophecy in Isaiah 7. Said, "Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel." Brother man points to this as the super sign as it come to be fulfilled. But there's a sign that a virgin shall conceive. All right. in in the message of super sign from 1959 he says you see in God's laws of redemption as it was with Boaz and Naomi it had to be a near kinsman and the only way that that man could be redeemed God had to become a kinsman near I want you to see it he never became kinfolks altogether to the rich to the mighty but he was born in the stable wrapped in swaddling cloth not to the adult but to a ch the child he was God over the creation he chose to do it not come a ful mature man. He came that he might suffer the feelings of the little babies. He came that he might go through the teenage temptations might go that he could toil the toils and snares of the devil as a man and make a way for the people of all ages of all ages and of all classes. The poor, the rich, the all. He became poor that through his poverty we might become rich and heirs with him in the kingdom. A sign would be given crossing himself making himself something different than what he was. Now a super sign crying as a baby, playing as a boy, toiling as a man. But it was God living in all stages of life like we do. &gt;&gt; What was a super sign? It was God living in human flesh through the stages of life like we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Born like we're born. Amen. Dependent on parents like we're dependent on parents. Eating food and growing and learning and and all of the things that we do. What was it? It was a super sign. God manifesting in flesh as a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here in 1961 in Super Sign, he says, "No matter how much they didn't receive it, it was there just the same. No matter how much they don't receive it today and want manmade achievement, God's sign still remains the same. A super sign. Not a polished up thing of the world with a lot of education and man-made achievement. No, not that. Not things of the world or anything tacked to the world." He said, "I'm not of the world." Well, what will it be? It will be God made flesh among us. God made flesh among us. That will be the super sign. God and flesh ought to be striking to the world. Jehovah, God became one of us. Changed his cast from great immortal Jehovah. Jehovah to become a little infant baby. Amen. So what is super what is the super sign? God made flesh among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, in everything we preach and everything we talk about, everything brother Brennham brought us, he never brought us a word. Amen. Just to show us where God was and what God did, but he's trying to show us what he's doing and where he's taking us. &gt;&gt; So, in Matthew chapter 1, it rehearses the the the uh the the prophecy out of Isaiah 7. It said, "Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us." So the super sign brought God into flesh and God in flesh was God with us. Before it was God above us, now it's God with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now again in 61 super sign says but he gave a super sign so that about one10enth of them would believe it. See see he gave a super sign but hardly any of them believed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See what man calls great God calls foolish. And what man calls foolish God calls great. Now we cannot dispute Isaiah's uh Isaiah's word here. Then God said through Isaiah I will give them an everlasting sign. Everlasting. and a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son and call his name Emanuel. I will be in him, God with us, a super sign. Not a polished scholar, but a super sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to John chapter 14 together. John chapter 14 verse 18. In verse 18 he says, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me because I live ye shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; Brother M comes to verse 20 when he quotes it later in the ministry. He said at that day he said that's this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the revelation is made known it will be I'm in the father and ye in me and I in you. He that hath my commandments and keep them. He it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me shall be loved in my father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Verse 22, Judas saith unto him, not a scariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? Amen. This is the this is the this is the great mystery. Jesus says, I'm going to come to you, and if you keep my commandments, my father will love you, and I'll love you, and I'll manifest myself to you. And here he is. Here he is gone standing in flesh. Jesus Christ. A man that they touched, that they laid next to, that they fished with, that that they they've done all these things with. And this is how they know him. And he says, "How are you going to manifest yourself or reveal yourself to us and not to the world? If we see you, they'll see you. How is this all going to work?" And so now he comes and he tells him verse 23, Jesus answered and said unto him, "If a man love me, he will keep my words and my father will love him. And we," Remember we talked about this a couple services ago, "And we, who?" The father and the son. Is it two different people? No. He's telling you the fullness is going to be in you. Amen. The office of father, the office of son through the office of comforter or holy ghost is going to come into you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But man, love me. He will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him. How are you going to manifest yourself to us and not to the world? I mean, we can see you right here. You're manifest. The world sees you, too. They may reject, but how are you going to manifest yourself? Here's how I'm going to do it. Amen. I am going to come inside of you. That's how I'm going to manifest myself to you and reveal myself to you and dwell in you. And it's going to be once again God and flesh. The manifest myself in God and flesh, one man. But I'm going to manifest myself God and flesh, many members. &gt;&gt; That's how I'm going to reveal myself to you and not to the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The world may see it and not understand it and pass by it and walk by it and ridicule it or ignore it or have nothing to do with it. Amen. But but to the believer, it's going to be a manifestation of God revealing himself again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. He goes on and he says in super sign, the super sign, this is from 63. Now, oh God, if the world could only see that that God and man are one, the super sign was that first man that God could come into. All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all Christ was, he poured into the church. Super sign. God and man together. That was to be the super sign of the last day. So, so we got this uh God and man together that was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last day. A super sign. Now, he's not talking about Jesus's day. He's talking about our day. He's talking about a super sign in our day. The super sign in that day was God and man as one in the flesh of Jesus Christ. But now there's coming to another super sign in our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now in the last day, a super sign, a virgin shall conceive, and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifest in flesh, a super sign." They still don't believe it, but it was anyhow. It's still a super sign. &gt;&gt; And go to the next part of the quote. Notice super sign. They've got Superman today. They got fictions of Superman. All these other kind of super things. But the church has got a super sign. God back in the church manifested in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Listen, the church in the end time received a a super sign. God united with man, his sure super sign. Notice the eternal sign, an unfailing sign. It will never fail. The word and man become one. When God's word and man become one, as St. John the first chapter said, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. That's the super sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, if that was the super sign of that day when the when the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ comes into the church to manifest the written word for the day, that's still the super sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we've seen a super sign back in the church today. Amen. And and and when you look at the ministry of brother Bam as Malachi 4. Amen. And he come on the scene to do what? He come to bring the revelation of the seventh seal for he was the messenger of the seventh seal and it was being revealed in him because now God had a vessel that he could work through and he worked through the vessel of William Brandham and as he did he did things that man can't do. He did things that only God can do. He did things that only Messiah could do. He did things that God did on the plains of memory when he visited Abraham at the time for the promise. when he stipped into fle flesh temporarily and had his back to the tent and told Sarah what she was thinking. Amen. In her heart in the tent behind him and discerning the thoughts of the heart. That was the sign of the Messiah. He did it thousands of years ago to Abraham. He did it when he came in the flesh of Jesus Christ. And when did he show that sign of the Messiah? When God came in flesh. He came in flesh on the plains of memory. He came in flesh. Amen. In Jesus' day, but in the end time at the opening of the seven seals. At the at the revealing of the seventh seal, he came in flesh again in the ministry of William Brandham and turned his back to a crowd and showed the sign of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; A super sign. God and man connected together displaying the word for our hour. &gt;&gt; We don't leave the super sign thousands of years ago. But friends, I'm not even going to leave the super sign 50, 60 years ago &gt;&gt; because that sign was for a purpose to show us something to build our faith to give us confidence to positionally place us to open our eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the same spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today, that is still the super sign. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, he says, "But look, right at the end time before the burning and the destroying, the super sign appears mysteriously." What is this? This is brother Brandham's ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The super sign appears mysteriously right on the scene again before us. Amen. God himself. &gt;&gt; You got it. &gt;&gt; Not a man. But God made manifest a super sign and an everlasting sign, an eternal sign, a super sign, God manifested in the flesh. Same sign that his son did. His super son promised the same at the end. As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the son of man. The days of Sodom, the the visitation of God to Abraham on the plains of Mamry. Amen. Jesus Christ pointed to it and he says, "As it was then, it will be at the return of the son of man, at the revealing of the son of man." Amen. When I come back to you, Amen. You're going to see the same thing that you saw in the days of Sodom. And friends, we've seen it. &gt;&gt; We witnessed in this generation a super sign. Not just 2,000 years ago, a super sign, but in this generation, a super sign. &gt;&gt; God manifest in the flesh. Amen. Brother Brandon was told by by God, God came to him, amen, through an angel and began to speak to him and tell him, amen, as he was sitting against a tree, pondering the scripture that we read last service about if you say unto this mountain, be plucked up and cast into the sea, and doubt not in your heart. And as he's pondering this, brother Bram said, I never understood it. I never preached it. And all of a sudden, God came to him and began to speak to him. &gt;&gt; And he began to tell him that you can do that. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he began to encourage him to speak and and he says, "Well, what will I say?" And he says, "Well, you're hunting. You have no squirrels and you need squirrels." And so he was moving him by leadership. Amen. And and he was beginning to display what? And you know when brother Brandham then began to speak, Amen. He said, "There'll come a squirrel from here to there and here to there and appear over here." And whatever he said is exactly what happened. Amen. And brother Brandham never took credit for creating squirrels &gt;&gt; because he in himself as a human being born of a man and woman could not create squirrels. But it was God working in that flesh. And when he spoke by the command and direction of God, brother Benham said it's the same as deity speaking. &gt;&gt; It came into existence because God and God was manifesting the super sign again. God and man connected as one. a vessel that he had control of that he could work through. &gt;&gt; And then brother Bam tells us, listen, not even Jesus did that sign. &gt;&gt; He said because Jesus took bread that was already baked and made more. &gt;&gt; But this was creating out of nothing just by the spoken word. And brother Brandham connected it right back to Genesis 1 that God created everything by the spoken word. And it was the same life, the same power, the same God that spoke the world into existence was the same God through a vessel of clay that spoke squirrels into existence. &gt;&gt; It was a super sign. &gt;&gt; It was a super sign. Listen, that super sign came for a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We talked about this last week. It didn't come for squirrels &gt;&gt; because those squirrels were created, lived a few seconds or few minutes, were shot and were put in a pot and were eaten. &gt;&gt; So that manifestation wasn't for the squirrels. &gt;&gt; That manifestation was for you and I. &gt;&gt; He said God manifest in the flesh. Same sign that his son did. His super son promised the same at the end as it was in the days of Sodom. So shall it be at the coming of the son of man. The super sign will return. We've had all these other things. The path of Abraham's royal seed has come up. The same path that Abraham came up. But just before the destroying of the world, the super sign must appear again. an eternal everlasting resurrection sign that proves that the royal seed could not be killed like Daniel and like the rest of the prophets was. The grave couldn't hold him because the others conquered the gates of the enemy such as fire and lion and sword and so forth. They conquered that. But this royal seed conquered death, hell, and the grave. Nothing could hold him. Why? He's an everlasting super sign. Continuing on, what is a super sign? The resurrection of Jesus Christ. So, not only is the super sign, Amen. God and man is one, but the super sign is also the resurrection. Amen. Because they couldn't hold him in the grave. He overcame death hell in the grave. What is the super sign? The resurrection of Jesus Christ. After being dead for 2,000 years, I thought he was dead. I thought he only laid dead for two, three days. What's he talking about now? Which resurrection is he talking about now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The resurrection of Jesus Christ after being dead for 2,000 years still stands in the midst of us the same as he did then. Manifesting himself in his church. In human flesh. How's he manifesting himself in the church? In human flesh. &gt;&gt; We all seen it. We hear the testimonies. We hear it on tapes. Amen. We've we've heard about it. That was gone. Christ manifesting himself in flesh. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. A virgin shall conceive. And from that time, God and man will be one, united together. An everlasting eternal sign, a super sign. Then he then he starts singing this song. He lives. He lives. Christ Jesus lives today. You ask me how I know he lives. He lives within my heart. I listen. I see him among us. All of his elected seed will see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How will you manifest yourself to us and not to the world? Amen. Because my father and I, if you keep the commandments, if you receive the word, if you believe all of the word and everything and the restoration of the word at the end time, if you believe this word and keep the commandments, I will love you. My father will love you and we will come into you and make our abode. How are you going to reveal yourself to us and not them? This is how I'm going to reveal myself to you. By coming into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother said, "I see him among us. I see it, too." Said, "All of his elected seed will see it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Exodus together. We read this recently, but I'm going to read this and then jump to another scripture. Exodus chapter 19, starting at verse three. God had sent a mighty sign down to to Egypt to free his his children and and for them to to confirm the time of the promise and confirm the the coming of the deliverer which the deliverer was Jesus Christ. It was God. It was it was God himself coming down to deliver. He said, "I have come down to deliver my people. Now, Moses, I send you." So Moses played the role of deliverer, but the deliverer was the life of God inside Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can say Moses was the deliverer. That's true because he was playing, he was the flesh man that was playing the role of deliverer, but the real deliverer was the life inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so so now he comes down and God shows a mighty sign and all that he does through Moses. He shows that God and man are working together in partnership and he's working through Moses. And Moses does things no man can do. Amen. He speaks flies and flies come and frogs and and all the plagues that fall. He starts doing miraculous things as a sign. And he he was a sign to them. But but that sign had a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we talked about this before, but we'll do it again. Exodus 19 and3 he says and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all the people for uh above all people, for all the earth is mine, and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. So God sent a sign, a major sign, a prophetic sign to show that this is the time of deliverance, that the deliverer has come. And Moses was showing that the deliverer was on the scene. And through that vessel, God is delivering his people. But he did it for a purpose. And the purpose was the fulfillment of the prophecy that God was going to take the children, the seed of Abraham, and put them in the word, &gt;&gt; in their land. &gt;&gt; Amen. and that those people would be a kingdom full of priests and a holy nation and a peculiar people. &gt;&gt; The sign was not just so you could say Moses is great. Moses amazing and God did amazing things through Moses, but the sign came to bring a deliverance to bring you out to to take them in so that they would be positionally placed in their position in the word. &gt;&gt; We're together. &gt;&gt; Now, let's turn to uh First Peter. pull the scripture up here. First Peter chapter 2. Amen. I love having the PowerPoint up here, but it sounds so good to hear the pages of the Bible turn. &gt;&gt; There's something about the word of God. Amen. and looking into it that I like. All right. First Peter chapter 2. I got to find it. Sorry, I'm talking and I can't even turn my Bible fast enough. 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 5. Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifice acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone elected precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore, which believe he is precious, but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient, wherein to also they were appointed. But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God, which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. &gt;&gt; So here he is taking this this word and he's preaching, amen, to Gentiles. He said, you who were not a people are now a people. Amen. people who didn't know the Old Testament, people who didn't know Moses ministry, and now he's coming and he's showing what Jesus Christ did. There was a super sign to bring deliverance in their day that he says, "But God has called you to be a peculiar people." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You are lively stones." Back in verse five, you are lively. That means living. &gt;&gt; You are living stones. You this this is not a dead building. This is not dead stone building, but you are living stones. And stone in the Bible is a revelation and a revelation. And to us, it's a confession of our revelation. But the stone is a is is a revelation. And you are a living revelation. Amen. Built together to be a spiritual house. &gt;&gt; A spiritual house. Listen, that means really the church of God has nothing to do with the mortar, the brick, the stone, the metal, the carpet, everything you see around you. It is a spiritual house. Amen. It's through the individual built as a living stone. and all of the living revelations of God. Amen. Brought together to be a house that he's dwelling in. &gt;&gt; A a holy priesthood. &gt;&gt; Amen. To offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God. And I was to go back to verse 9 again. But you are a chosen generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are predestinated to this position. You are a chosen generation. a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praises of him that hath called you out of darkness into the marvelous light. We are called and positionally placed to show forth his praises, his life, his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God for his positional placing. Every time this sign came, this great prophetic sign. Amen. God was trying to bring his people into their position or bring them back to their position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over and over again. Let's turn now to Revelation chapter 1. Revelation chapter 1. We're going to go to verse four. John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come. And from the seven spirits which are before his throne. and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us hath &gt;&gt; past tense &gt;&gt; hath made us kings and priests unto God his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. &gt;&gt; Has he made you that? Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother BM goes through this in the church age book and he takes this same scripture. He hath made us kings and priests and to God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. He hath made us whole. There are certain truths we need to emphasize. So let's go ahead and emphasize it. This is one of them. He He hath made us. Salvation is his doing. Salvation is of the Lord. All of his grace. He redeemed us for a purpose. He bought us for a purpose. We are kings, spiritual kings. Oh, we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne. But now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom. It says in Romans 5:17, "For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ." Then he goes on to the next Colossians 1:13. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom, the reign of his dear son. &gt;&gt; Right now we reign with Christ, having dominion over sin, the world, the flesh, and the devil. &gt;&gt; So what do we have dominion over? The sin, the world, the flesh, and the devil. Amen. What is it that's challenging you in your life? What is it that's trying to overcome you in your life? Amen. What is it that's trying to disrupt you? Amen. Don't worry about what's going on with the neighbors. And don't worry about going on in politics. Don't worry about all that. Amen. There there's been there there's the the sin and the world. Amen. Which is unbelief in the world, the spirit of the world and the flesh, the flesh you live in, and the devil. They're all working together to try to derail you, to try to stop you. But praise God, we are spiritual kings reigning over those things. &gt;&gt; We reign over unbelief. Unbelief can't reign over us. We reign over unbelief. Amen. The world can't reign over us, but that worldly spirit has to come under our dominion. Amen. Amen. The flesh that I live in that's trying to derail me all the time. This flesh I have dominion over because I have spiritual authority as a king to tell the flesh no. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have to let sin I don't have to let the lust of the flesh I don't have to let it rule me. It doesn't matter how strong the temptation. It doesn't matter how many times it comes. Amen. If I find myself a slave to temptation, then I don't understand who I am in Christ. I don't understand my God-given position, authority, and rights as a spiritual king, kings and priests because he has already made me that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to say yes to the flesh. I can tell the flesh no. And I can bring the flesh subject to my dominion as a spiritual king. &gt;&gt; The same thing to the devil. I don't have to give the devil access to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has no rights. Amen. He because I'm a spiritual king and I have authority over unbelief, over the worldly spirit, over my own flesh, and over the devil. He can only come and take advantage of me if I give him permission to. That's right. &gt;&gt; He can only come and begin to derail my life and bring deception into me is if I open the door because I'm the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now we reign. Right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We reign with Christ having dominion over sin, the world, the flesh, and the devil. Showing forth his praise and glory. showing forth himself for it is Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why we're spiritual kings. &gt;&gt; Because the king is living in us &gt;&gt; because we're children of the king. Because that seed gain's been quickened to life, which is part of himself. And now his life is here anointing it, growing it to take dominion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Showing forth himself. For it is Christ in us, willing and doing of his good pleasure. Yes indeed, even now we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and made us priests. Yes, priests unto him, offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips, spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him. Worshiping him in spirit and in truth, interceding and petitioning, priests and kings unto our God. No wonder the world does not appeal to us. And we are a peculiar people, zealous unto good works. We have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad for the recreated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not what I was, but he's I've been born again by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to look at this back uh this last paragraph a little more slowly. We are priests unto him offering spiritual praise of sanctified lips. Amen. So the priest in the Old Testament did many things. One of the duties of the priest was to sing praises and glorify the name of God. And that's part of what we're here to do. We are priests unto him. Amen. We are uh uh priests unto him offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips. We're here to sing of his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't come to church to hear the song leader sing. We come to church to sing with our own sanctified lips. &gt;&gt; Praises unto his name. spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him. &gt;&gt; So what is our offering? What is our sacrifice? What is our gift that we bring? It's ourselves. &gt;&gt; It's our lives. &gt;&gt; Worshiping him in spirit and in truth. Interceding and petitioning. &gt;&gt; Another part of what the the priest's job was to do was to intercede for the sins of others. and to petition God on behalf of the nation of Israel. And God, because he's called us into this position, we're here to be priests unto him, to offer praises unto him. We're here to worship him in spirit and truth. We're here to offer him a gift of our lives as a sweet offering unto him. But we're also here to intercede in petition &gt;&gt; for one another, for those that are around us. Amen. We can't forget that we're not just here to sing his praises and declare his truth. We're here to intercede and petition. &gt;&gt; I'm not I don't have time to go into that. I got to go into another area. But I just want to labor on that for a minute and leave that here. Amen. Whatever you're seeing going wrong, there's a reason you're seeing it. Whenever you see a need in a brother, sister, a co-orker, a family member, Amen. Don't forget that you are now a king and priest by the grace of God, by the new birth, and you've been put into a position. And who can intercede for that need but you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; In the message perseverant, he says, "Now we believe the Bible to be God's infallible word. We believe that it is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ revealing himself in the Old Testament by the prophets. God making himself known through his son Christ Jesus. And in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily. He was crucified for our sins. Died, buried, rose the third day, ascended into heaven, and is back here again in in the name of in the form of the Holy Spirit. God dwelling. One time God above us in Christ, God with us. Now, God in us. It's God working his way back into man to worship, to be worshiped through man. God's agency. God does nothing outside of man being his agent, his helper. I love this. The whole plan of God, God above us, God with us, God in us is God working his way back into man again. &gt;&gt; That's what he wants in this hour. Friends, the second fold of the three-fold purpose is that he'll have preeminence. That he'll be back in us &gt;&gt; as king. And the message influence he says we've got to have him for he is life and he alone not to know his book not to know this or to know that or know the creed but to know him is life now know him as a person Christ in you the word made flesh in you that's knowing him when he you and he become becomes one like I said last night in the super sign he has got to come in you God and man must become one. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham makes this statement and and I want to break it down the way it hit me. He says, "Not to know his book is not to know him." Just to be able to read, just to be able to to agree with and and read the Bible and say, "Yeah, that's right." That's not necessarily knowing him and not to know this or to know that or to know the creed, but to know him as life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing him as the person, &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the word made flesh in you. That's knowing him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can't even say, "Well, I know him." Because brother Brandham said, "I know him." No, no. To know him is personal. To know him is to know the person Christ in you. Amen. Manifesting through your flesh. That's knowing him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the knowing him I want to know. Amen. not knowing facts about him or details about him. But I want that personal knowledge of him and I becoming one and him taking the rulership in my life and his spirit leading through me, manifesting his word through my flesh. Amen. Overcoming things I couldn't overcome before. Amen. Changing things in my life I couldn't change before. Bringing me to a greater manifestation of his word. That's knowing him. And that's the knowing him I want to know. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. In Colossians, he says, "Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory. We believe it was Christ and brother Brandham, but now the mystery among the Gentiles is Christ in you. This becomes such a personal revelation. This is not a group revelation. It's a personal revelation. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He says, "Listen, listen close now. I want you not to fail to get this. No other church, no other sign, no other fellowship, no other government, no other testimony, no other creed, no denomination is accepted outside of this. God accepts nothing else but that. Christ in you, the hope of glory. The only thing that God recognizes. &gt;&gt; No fellowship, no church, no creed, no denomination, no nothing. Everything else is dead. It's fragments that has to be cut off, pruned off away from the thing that Christ might live with preeminence in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I You know what? I thank God for a fellowship like we have a group of believers that can come together like-minded in fellowship and love the same things. But my my association with the group is not what he's looking for and not what he accepts. My identification verbally with the message saying I believe brothers a prophet I believe the message that's not what he accepts. There's only one thing that he accepts. And what he accepts is God accepts nothing else but that. Christ in you, the hope of glory. That Christ himself has entered in and taken dominion and brought a new birth. Amen. By his personal presence in our lives. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that God will recognize. Amen. Then that's his goal for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. to have his people in this kind of relationship. Again, in Christ is the mystery. He says his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself, the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you. A vindication of the great revelation of God. Look, only in an individual, never in a group. You got that? I know you got it because we've read it before, but I can't labor on it enough, friends, because this has to be something that is real with me in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An individual, not in a group. His identification is with an individual. You get that? Not with the Methodist, not with the Baptist, not the Presbyterian, not the Luther, not the Pentecostals, but as an individual. I'll take one and leave one. I'll separate them. That's right. There'll be two in the field. I'll take one, leave one. There'll be two in the bed. I'll take one, leave one. It's not a group. It is a personal vindication of a pregnantated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about. Can I can I highlight this? &gt;&gt; This is the key, friends. &gt;&gt; This is one of the great keys &gt;&gt; we're talking about. so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, we we've got families. We've got jobs. We've got responsibilities. God put us on earth to live a human life on earth. &gt;&gt; Listen, don't be mistaken. He wants you to go work. &gt;&gt; He wants you to interact with people at work. He wants you to interact in the community. He wants you to interact with family. God wants you to live a human life. He wants you to do things that human do. He wants you to cook food. He wants you to go take walks. He wants you to enjoy flowers. He wants you to smell the roses. &gt;&gt; He created them for all of that. &gt;&gt; But there's got to come one thing that becomes our primary goal. And there's only one thing that we truly care about. And that is that's so surrendered to God that you don't care about anything else but God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the Holy Spirit living its life, pulsating through him, showing the personal vindication of the word itself, expressing itself to the people and to the world. That's what God wants to do with this individual relationship. He wants to manifest himself in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be so surrendered to that life of God that I don't care about anything else but God. And it's not that I won't care. Listen, brother Bam says to the individual. Never a group. Never a group. To the individual, not my church. My church has nothing to do with. Listen, when I say that, I I I mean, I I know that you I trust that you know, and we're all believers. We know that when I come to this relationship with Christ, it doesn't mean that I'm not going to go to church anymore. &gt;&gt; Because it's the No, I think this kind of relationship makes you the most faithful to church. Amen. Because brother Bam said, "If God lives in your heart, you can't wait for them doors to open to get in there and fellowship with your brothers." So, this kind of relationship doesn't drive you off into isolation and cause you to leave parts of the word. Amen. No, it's not. It's not it at all. But just coming to church isn't enough. Just being part of the group isn't enough. Just being identified with isn't enough. It's got to be individual with you in Christ. But if it's individual with you in Christ, then it'll be really good with you and everybody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I say don't care about anything else, it doesn't mean you give up on your family. You stop talking to your kids and and you go off and live as a monk somewhere in the world cuz I don't care. I don't want to. No, it means everything else is secondary. That is this. This is primary. This is the greatest care of my life. And then when I'm interacting with others and when I'm living a life, when I'm taking a walk and I feel the sunshine, all I'm thinking about is God who created the sun. When I smell the flowers, I'm thinking about God who created that flower. When I see my children, I'm thanking God for life. And I'm looking at a family. And I'm recognizing this is what God's wanting to do on the earth is be a family. &gt;&gt; Everything else is secondary. And my whole focus is God. That's where we've got to be, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the rapture message, I want to I want to talk about this now. I want to close out talking about this, but I'm not closing out. We're all together, right? I don't want to I don't want to falsely represent anything, but I want to turn and I want to finish out with this discussion on the rapture. said, 'There the message calls the bride together, see the shout and the trumpet. The same one he with a loud voice he screamed out with that shout uh with shout and a voice and woke Lazarus with a loud voice he cried, "Lazarus, come forth." And the voice wakes up wakes up the sleeping bride, the sleeping dead. And the trumpet with the sound of a trumpet and when it does, it calls always a trumpet calls Israel to the feast of trumpet sea which was a Pentecostal feast, the great feast in the sky. and the feast of the trumpets. Now, a trumpet uh does announce a calling together. Come to the feast. And now that is the lamb's supper in the sky. Now, watch the assembling together and the bride, the feast of the trumpets, the wedding supper. Brother Random, when he comes to preach this the the the rapture, he goes to First Thessalonians. Let's read this together. 1 Thessalonians 4:15. He says, "For this this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother comes to this scripture and he shows that the rapture takes place in three phases or three parts. And first it's a shout then a voice and then the trump. And he says the shout is the message, amen, that goes out that gathers the bride together. And he said the voice will be the voice of the resurrection. He said it's the same voice that cried to Lazarus that brought him out of the ground. It's the same voice that'll bring forth the sleeping saints. Amen. Then there'll be a resurrection and then the trump will be the gathering to the marriage supper. So So the shout gathers the the bride together. The voice brings the resurrection of the sleeping saints and the trump changes our Adams and brings us all into the in the married supper. So we just want to talk about that. Says I wonder could it be already passed? Brother Benham in the rapture, he just got done talking about the experience he had of the preview of the bride when he saw the first church go by all in order marching and then he saw the modern church go by and he says it was a bunch of strip teases and it broke his heart and he said, "Oh God, of all the laboring we've done and this is the best we can do and his heart was just broken." But then as he's sitting there with a broken heart, he hears onward Christian soldiers and he looks again and he sees a church just like the first church coming through again for preview. And then in the end he at the end of the line he sees two getting out of step and he and he starts hollering out get back in step and he comes back to himself amen hollering get back in step and that's where he says wonder could it be already passed could the bride already be called? Is that what we're going through today? She has to be molded and made into the image of Christ and Christ is the word. Now, Brother Bram's asking the question, I'm going to black out. It's because you read ahead. If we have any visitors, I'm sorry, but we have a very unruly assembly and they read ahead, so I have to black out the screen. But, and if I was sitting in your seat, I'd read ahead, too. And I'd probably hate say amen before. Yeah. Ruin everything. But the whole point is is I'll I'll open it just for a minute. She has to be molded and made into the image of Christ and Christ is the word. Brother B ask the question did I in seeing that is the bride already called? &gt;&gt; Is it already finished? And I don't believe so because I didn't get the call till 1999. So &gt;&gt; I personally don't believe it was already done. But what did he say? But but she has to be molded. Amen. To the word. She has to be molded into Christ. So even after the bride is called, it's not as just all all the bride's called and that's it. If the bride's called, she's still got to be molded. She's got to lay in the presence of the son. She's got to come to be exactly like Jesus Christ. She's got to grow into something. She's got to grow into the headship into the stature of a perfect man into the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; So he's teaching us a valuable lesson here. She has to be molded and made into the image of Christ. And Christ is the word. That's the only thing. See, it's in there. The It's in the word. There cannot be one thing added. It It can't be a woman with one hand like a man and other hand with a paw like a dog. It's got to be exactly the word of the Lord like he is the word. The bride is part of the bridegroom. The woman is part of her husband because she's taken out of the husband. Eve was a part of Adam from his side. And so is the bride. Not taken from a denomination, but taken from the bosom of the word of God for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's showing that this this bride has got to come into the very image of Christ. And Christ is the word. Amen. And the word that has been revealed in our hour, which is the fullness of the word that's been restored to us. And she has to display all of that word because he is the word and she must become the word. So God is molding us into the image of Christ. Friend, we're not wasting our time here. Right? &gt;&gt; We're not living this life just wasting time and thinking in ourselves, "Oh, I wish we'd finally get that last one so we could come in." Even if the last one was here, we still got to be molded into the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, listen, we're not sitting on our hands and twiddling our thumbs saying one day the rapture is going to come when we finally somebody in the mission field finally works hard enough and brings that last one in. Well, there's a truth to that. We're not going anywhere till the last one comes in. But even if the last one comes in, we're not going anywhere till we start reflecting the entire word of God. So for me to bring about the rapture means I must surrender more. I must listen more. I must feed more. I must die out to self more. If I'm going to move this rapture along, I'm not going to do it by sitting down and and and and grunting about missionaries and go find. I'm going to do it by molding myself to this word by allowing Christ to come and have his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. by allowing Jesus Christ and by by anything that's contrary to his words by denouncing it. Amen. And asking God to get it out of my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she's got to come into the very image of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Friends, we we can't change ourselves, but we can sure surrender. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can we can sure feed on the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. There's so many times we want great changes in our life and we want everything in our life to change, but we just go on doing what we always did and we want everything in our life to change. Amen. If we want something in our life to change, amen, why don't we just dig a little deeper into the word? Why don't we just dive down a little more and why don't we commit ourselves a little more to the very thing that's changing us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us. Amen. Listen, this word is changing us. &gt;&gt; We're coming into his likeness as he reveals himself. Amen. In the preaching of the word and all of that. But listen, Sunday and Wednesday is not enough, friends. We've got we've got to care about nothing else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because she has to be him. In the Leodysian church age, brother BM says the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It's its own mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. Yes, it is. For it says in the last chapter, Revelation 17, the spirit and the bride say, come once more. The world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost. But of course, that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age. God has a voice on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that he says this again later in the latest church age. God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride. That voice is in the bride as we have said and we will talk about later. Why? Because he is dwelling in her. &gt;&gt; He is living in her. &gt;&gt; And the rapture has three phases to it. First is the shout. We've seen the shout go out and the shout is still going out. The message is going out and gathering people. Amen. gathering the bride together. But there's got to be a voice in the day, a voice of resurrection. And I'm I'm not here to tell you exactly what it will look like, exactly what will happen. But there's one thing for sure. God has a mouthpiece on the earth. And he has a voice on the earth. And that voice is in his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that voice is maybe not always what we think a voice is. He says in Revelation 10, he says, "I looked and I took the little book out of the angel's hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." So in the end time, the bride who's eating this book, she must be prophesying again. &gt;&gt; But I've read this quote to you many times, but I want to go to it again because it's just amazing to me. Brother says, "And here was voices." He's talking about voices that were in the throne room. He said, "And here was voices. Oh, how we need in Jeffersonville. Thousands of lived voices, the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness, purity, undefiled lives, walking around in the earth today without a blemish." Yes, sir. Real Christians, that's thunder against the enemy. &gt;&gt; The devil don't care how loud you can holler. The devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout. But what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that. That's a little different than what we think sometimes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Say anything to him, call him anything, just as sweet as he can be and move right on. That throws him away. That's the thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. And not necessarily what we think is thunder that would shake the devil. We we would like to thunder against the devil sometimes, but the thundering against the devil is a surrendered life to Christ. &gt;&gt; Living in humility and sweetness and just surrendering to God and letting God take control. Amen. And so, Brother B said in Jeffersonville, we need thousands of lived voices. A voice is something that declares a message. It speaks something to somebody. But brother Bam told us one time, he said, "I let your life preach your sermon." &gt;&gt; I mean, not everyone's called to be a preacher. If you're called to be a preacher, preach it. But you've got to live it. Let your life live your sermon. And man, and and we as a people, we have to live the word. The word has to be on display. It can't just be in our mouths, but it has to be our life. &gt;&gt; And our life is the life of Christ in bride form in us. And it speaks volumes. It's a testimony. Listen, it's a life. And and when when brother Brandham surrendered to that life and that life came in him and began to manifest the word for our day, it was a super sign. &gt;&gt; And then we as a bride of Jesus Christ, if we could surrender ourselves to this word and give him access and room to work and he can come down and manifest that word in us and that word begins to manifest in all of us the fullness of the word in us. Guess what that's going to be again friends? That's going to be another super sign. &gt;&gt; Because the super sign is God and man is one. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, if I could get the world to see that there you are. There's the body of Christ living, standing, redeemed, redeemed. Oh my. Justified in his sight." Why are we justified? We are his victory. The church is his victory. He came forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory. He died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory. Amen. When we see him coming down and living among the church, that's his victory. &gt;&gt; Shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave, neither can they keep us. And we are already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of the eternal God which is himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus was on Calvary he had a work to do in that manifestation in that body of flesh that was God and man as one. That was the super sign. And in the super sign, he surrendered himself to God to do the work of redemption. And when he was on Calvary, hanging there. Amen. And the life was getting ready to leave his body. Amen. That was his victory in that day. His victory was being able to be crucified to bear the sins of the people and die in their place. And when he went to give up the ghost, he said, "Father, I commend myself in our spirit." He gave up the ghost. Amen. And he did his victory. Amen. This was his victory that he died. He shed his blood and he died as a substitute for you and I so that we can go free from what happened in the garden of Eden so the plan of God could move forward. This was redemption. It was his victory. And in his victory, he cried out. Amen. And he commended his soul to God and his spirit left his body. And all of a sudden, the temple veil rent from top to bottom to show that the mercy seat was there. That God, the atonement was paid, the price was paid. But it did something else. It woke up the sleeping saints. Amen. He had a victory in that day. And when Christ came forth, they came forth with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he ascended on high, they ascended on high. And they cried, "Lift up ye everlasting gates, and be ye lifted up. For the Lord of glory has come." They said, "Who is the Lord?" God grace Christ God mighty in battle. And he led captivity captive. What was his victory when he fully surrendered to the word for his day? When he gave his life completely to the purpose that God had for him and he and he died. Amen. That was a voice of resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I woke up to sleeping saints. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm not telling you how it will happen. I don't know how that voice. It's got to be the voice of Jesus Christ, the same one that woke up Lazarus. But I don't think it's a booming voice that all the earth hear yelling really loud. Okay, everybody, come out now. There's something God's going to do. There's a victory he's going to have in the end time, and it's going to bring the resurrection. Amen. There's got to be a perfect climax. There's got to be a perfection of his plan. There's got to be another super sign on this earth. And God's going to have another victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we see him coming down and living among the church, that's his victory. What's it his victory in that day is that God could live in man and he could pay the price of redemption. He could become the atonement and set man free. And he had his victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that victory brought a resurrection. Amen. But in this day, he's looking for another victory. And what's his victory? And the purpose of the death and the reason for all of that is so that he could work his way back into mankind and back in the flesh and display that purpose in the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's he going to do it? I hope he's going to do it right here inside of me. I believe by faith I'll be part of that. I want to be. And to do that, I've got to care about nothing else but this. &gt;&gt; That's the way Jesus lived. He cared nothing else about this purpose. &gt;&gt; And that's the way we need to live, friends. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is the mystery of God revealed again. He says, "Never able to come to the knowledge of the truth." And these men resisted it as Janice and Jambre Jambre and Janice withtood Moses able to produce a church, produce a group of people. Yes, sir. But their folly will be made manifest when Jesus takes his bride, sets her up here, and said, "This is her." And away he goes with her. That's right. And their folly will be made known. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not going to interpret how that'll happen because this is yet prophecy. I think this is yet prophecy. Amen. God will do it. How is he going to put this bride on display and say, "This was her." Then away he goes with her. I don't know what he's going to do, but I know his life in her is his victory and the purpose of his death. &gt;&gt; That's the victory he wants to have in this day. The victory he wants to have in this day was not to send Malachi 4, but Malachi 4 came to bring about this purpose to bring a people out. Amen. And to bring them in, out of denominationalism, out of hybridization and back into the fullness of the word and union with Christ. And that's his victory when he gets preeminence in his people. &gt;&gt; That's his great victory in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when we look at what his great victory and his great purpose and what he's trying to accomplish, when I look at all of that and I I I look at what he's done to bring us here, I look at the vindication of a prophetic ministry, the miraculous, the the pictures, the videos, the tapes, the recording, the everything that he did, the world events that moved at the time a prophet was on earth so that you could have prophet point out the Elijah and the Ahab and and the movement and the world wars and all the things that happened and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and tie it together with Revelation 13. I mean friends or Revelation 11. I marvel at what God did and I look at all that he did and he and he and he moved political powers. He moved people. He he did wars. He did everything all for what? All for this purpose. What purpose? so that &gt;&gt; he could live in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The power of this revelation to the individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's going to be the power that moves this program to completion. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not going to be listen I don't personally this is my personal I don't believe it's going to be any big sweeping ministry that goes through and brings you know super tremendous revelation I don't believe it's I believe it's going to be all those individuals who just keep surrendering &gt;&gt; keep surrendering keep surrendering and and he gets more preeminence and more preeminence and begins to manifest himself amen in everything in life &gt;&gt; our thought life, our private life, our work life, our family life, our church life. And in every part of life, he gets the preeminence in our life. When we're by ourselves, he has preeminence. When we're alone with our thoughts, he has preeminence. When we're with our family, he has preeminence. When we're at work, he has preeminence. When we're out with the guys, he has preeminence. &gt;&gt; That's the great goal for this hour. And has everything to do with me as an individual and you as an individual. Listen, I'm not going to take a rapture for you and you're not going to take a rapture for me. This is an individual affair. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But oh God, help me not to hold up progress. &gt;&gt; Brother R makes this statement in shalom, and this one has been working on me. You know, I told you he talked about the symphony of Peter and the wolf, and he begins to talk through it all through this message of shalom. He said, "Man could close his mortal eyes to earthly sight and live in the presence of Jesus Christ." When you see his word being beat out in the great sympathy that we're living in, and he keeps changing the word symphony with sympathy that we're living in, changing, you must begin in the symphony. The only thing you can do if you're in the symphony, then you start, you begin to get into the rhythm. That's the way you do it. That's the way you do God. You don't stand off and look at it. &gt;&gt; You get into the rhythm of it. &gt;&gt; How do you get in there? You're born into it, into the rhythm of the word. When you become part of that word, &gt;&gt; you had to become part of the dance to get out of the dance. You had to become part of the ball game. Something you're interested in to get to get in the ball game. Oh, I just want to pause here for a minute. Brother Beam's giving us He's giving us a key, friends. He's giving us a secret. He's giving us a clue. Amen. If if you're in the symphony, listen, I don't want to be listening to a symphony. I'm supposed to be in the symphony. &gt;&gt; As God's playing it out, each one of us have an instrument to play. We've got a part to play. We have something to do. And if you're in the symphony, then you begin to get into the rhythm. That's the way you do God. You don't stand far off and look at it. You get into the rhythm of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, this is what we need to be doing. This is what we all need to be giving our life to is getting into the rhythm of the symphony of the word for the end time. We're not standing off and looking. Brother Bam said we don't come together to talk about the message. We come to get into the message, to get under it, to put it on. Amen. We're not here just to talk about what happened. We're not here just to talk about exciting things. And we're not here to just to re-evaluate all the things God did through Brother Brandham. That was a super sign. Amen. to bring us out of Egypt and bring us into the promised land so that we could take our position as kings and priests and become a sign in this end time. &gt;&gt; That's what God wanted out of his nation of Israel. He wanted them to be a sign of the world, a holy nation, a super race, a a super nation of people to show, amen, to the world what a God people would look like. But they failed. And they always failed. And every generation has always failed because they left his word. And when they left his word, they failed to become that super sign to the world. But God's predestinated a people in the end time that's not going to fail. &gt;&gt; But I want to get into the rhythm of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. In this message, I think it's this message might be another one. He starts talking about Amen. One person, you know, their whole job is to bang that symbol. One part. They got one little part and the whole symphony. Amen. and their only part is to bang that simple. &gt;&gt; And brother B starts talking about our parts and the what we can do for God and what God can use us for. And he says, he says, "But the symphony wouldn't be complete without that one part." &gt;&gt; Comes to a crescendo. It comes to a major part that has to have impact. And it needs that big gong to bang at a certain time. But it can't bang out a rhythm. It can't bang out a sequence. It can't bang out a time. It'll ruin the whole message of the symphony. It's got to sit there and wait for its time. And while it's sitting there waiting for its time, you can't go to the lobby and get popcorn. You can't go out. Amen. To see what's happening outside. You got to stay in rhythm with the symphony as everybody plays their part, waiting for your turn to come to play your part. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen friends. Brother Bam takes the simplest of the simplest things to teach us some of the most important lessons that we can learn. &gt;&gt; Amen. How are we going to come into this symphony? Amen. If we're not devoting time and attention, if we're not getting into the rhythm of what the spirit's doing in this age, Amen. We we get distracted. And the question is, what is distracting us? &gt;&gt; What is distracting our attention? What is it? I mean, I can just imagine the little guy with the gong and he's got his little paddle there and he knows I mean, he's got like three sheets of sheet music before he gets to him and he gets interested in something happened in the crowd and the little kid went to the bathroom. Now there's a fly &gt;&gt; and you may even see him sweep at it with his with his mallet once in a while. Listen, that kind of that kind of sincerity, that kind of dedication is going to cause him to miss his part and ruin the whole symphony. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; But what he's got to do is follow along in the sheet music. Listen to the change in the junctions and and catch where we're at in the rhythm. Where are we at in the beat? How close are we? Amen. Am I ready? Is it for me? No. I keep moving. I keep waiting. I keep going. But you got to stay engaged. And friends, in order for us to move with this symphony of God, we have got to stay engaged with what God is doing in this hour. &gt;&gt; We've got to be listening. We've got to be reading. We've got to be praying. Amen. Amen. We've got to be in fellowship with one another. Amen. We've got to be in rhythm with this symphony. &gt;&gt; We live in a world that's riddled with distraction. &gt;&gt; And you carry around a little black Well, some of you have really nice pretty pink ones and stuff, but little phone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's an instrument of distraction. It's a distraction for me, too. &gt;&gt; But but the whole world is riddled with distractions, things that take our time and attention. But I can't think of anything more valuable that to put my time and attention into than to the symphony. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think, well, I'm not being used and I don't have a position in church and nothing's really happening with me. Listen, that is no way. That is no way to be ready when your part comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to be moving from beginning to end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, help us to stay in the rhythm." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother B makes this statement. I thought it was so good at the end. You have to become part of the dance to get out of the dance. You have to become part of the ball game. Something you're interested in to get in the ball game. Listen, there's things I'm interested in. There's things I'm totally not interested in. If you took me to a NASCAR event and I sat there for hours watching cars go I mean when everybody shouts I have no idea what they're shouting about. &gt;&gt; If something good happens out there I don't even know what the good thing is that happens and everybody gets excited about it because I'm not in the rhythm of the race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you'll see people who will lose their minds cuz one car passed another. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They go absolutely berserk or they're yelling at the pit crew because it was two seconds too long and they're swearing profanities at a pit crew that can never hear them. &gt;&gt; They're at a ball game threatening the life of the umpire and his children and his grandchildren. Why? Because they get into the rhythm of the game and everything that's happening on the field is affecting them emotionally. It's moving them. Amen. They become hysterical. They become enthused. They become excited. Amen. and they have euphoric feeling. They leave they leave a building where they've done absolutely nothing for 4 hours but watch other people do something for 4 hours and they leave feeling great and and then listen what listen how they talk when they leave. Wasn't that a good game? You see this? We won. &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; We we &gt;&gt; Which inning did you play in? Why I didn't see you at bat? I mean, what do you mean we won? Because they got into harmony with the game. They became part of it, one with it. There was somebody they were rooting for, a team they were involved in, and they they knew everything that happened on the field. They went through the es, the flows, the highs, the lows, the good, the bad, the tense moment, the exciting moment. And they walked away feeling so good and feeling like we won. I want that feeling when I see my brother and sister overcome. When we see God break through, when we see somebody come to the Lord, somebody's eyes open to the revelation of the mystery. Somebody take a step they couldn't stay. I want to say we won. We won. We won. I want to get into the harmony. I want to get into the symphony. I want to say the word is working. Look at what it's doing in their life. Look what it's doing in my life. Look at what it's doing for all of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to sit on the sidelines and show up on Sunday and see how good the preacher preaches this Sunday and come to Wednesday and say, "Well, you know, my critique is this and he could have bad and he could get out of your mind and get back into the symphony of what God is doing. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of it. &gt;&gt; I want to play my position. And I want listen if my position is to cheer for the one who's running the first base. I want to cheer for the one who's running the first base. I want to be enthused. &gt;&gt; They say I don't know because I'm not an athlete. But they say that the roar of the crowd and the energy in the stadium can actually move the team. It can inspire them. Amen. It can get move them to greater feats. Amen. Listen, why don't we become a team? Why don't we root for our team? Why don't we become enthusiastic? Why don't we create a cheer and an enthusiasm and an excitement for whoever's running on the field and whoever's catching the ball? Why don't we pick up the intensity a little bit and get excited about the day that we live in? Listen, we're here to manifest another super sign. What is the super sign? Jesus in his day manifest the super sign of the resurrection. Death has no more hold on the children of God. He overcame death in himself. He said, "I have power to lay my life down. I have the power to take it up." And when he took it up, he didn't take it up for himself only, but all the saints that had slept in the Old Testament came with him. That was a super sign. &gt;&gt; And listen, we're living in the hour of another super sign. There's going to be a resurrection of sleeping saints. Amen. The super sign is among us. It's taking place. He's bringing it to pass right now. Almost any moment, any hour, any day. Amen. You're going to see saints arise. &gt;&gt; That we should be excited about. We should be in the rhythm of the resurrection. Amen. Listen, there's going to be an enthusiastic thing take place one of these days that's never happened before. Amen. There's going to be a people on this earth that don't resurrect &gt;&gt; because they're not going to need a resurrection because they're going to be so one with God that God is going to be so alive in their flesh that their flesh cannot die. But it'll change in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. It'll become a brand new body. No death but life. Let's get into the rhythm of the word. Let's get into the rhythm of the word, into the symphony that God's playing because we're living in the generation. Friend, are you tired of sitting on the sidelines wondering why everybody around you is excited and you don't know what they're excited about? Are you tired of sitting there saying, "All he's saying is confusion to me." I'm telling you, get into the message. Read, listen, talk about the only thing that matters in life. &gt;&gt; What you're doing. Amen. If God's not in it, it'll come to nothing. But if God anoints our day, if God anoints our work, if God anoints our family, if God anoints our hobby, then God is manifesting himself in us. &gt;&gt; This is the day we live in, friends. &gt;&gt; There's another super sign getting ready to manifest itself. &gt;&gt; The super sign of eternal life coming into flesh. &gt;&gt; That's what this message has come to bring us to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get into the rhythm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Get into harmony. &gt;&gt; No more going to church to see what happens. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to church to make something happen. I'm going to church cuz I'm in the rhythm. I'm going to church to bring an atmosphere. I'm going because we're growing by word by word. The bride is going up. Revelation upon revelation. Our eyes are becoming open. The Isab is bringing us crystal clear vision. Service by service, message by message, tape by tape, day by day, fellowship by fellowship. We are rising, friends. &gt;&gt; And it's going to come to a place where there's no other option but resurrection. &gt;&gt; Let's go on with this quote. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to become part of the dance to get out of the dance. You have to become part of the ball game. Something you're interested to get to get in the ball game. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to become part of the word to know God's symphony. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; His symphony is when it's playing. You understand? You're marching with the beat of the time. You're watching for it. The works that I do shall you also. &gt;&gt; Greater than this shall you do. These last days, oh my, the great changing of the time. We get into the beat of the word. Find his purpose. The hour that we're living, get into the rhythm of it. How does it? If you get into the word, you find out how he did at the beginning. Then you know what he's doing all the time. &gt;&gt; Listen, he wants to manifest through me. He wants me to pray. He wants Listen, we should believe when we pray, God hears and God moves because God wants to manifest himself. We should believe when we when we read prayer requests from up here, we expect them to be answered because God is going to show where his life is. He's going to show what he's doing in this hour. We got to get into the rhythm of the symphony and expect him to do abundantly above all that we ask or think because why? He's going to show another super sign. He's going to show his resurrected life in fullness in a many membered body. &gt;&gt; And what will happen and what he will do? I don't know all the particulars or details, but I know what I saw when he showed the super sign of a prophet in this day and what I watched there means everything is possible. Nothing is impossible and nothing's off the table. spoken word of creation. &gt;&gt; Possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walking on water, possible. &gt;&gt; Disappearing like Philip and showing up 100 miles. Possible. &gt;&gt; Supernatural provision by spoken word possible. Healings instantly possible. Salvation to those we love. Possible. It's all possible because God showed us through the super sign what's possible. And he's bringing another super sign. God and man becoming one in bride form. And we should believe it's possible and then get into harmony and rhythm with those possibilities. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not waiting to see what the preacher is going to do next and what great gifts going to come along and who's going. No, I'm part of the game. I'm I'm in this thing. I'm on the team. We are going to win. &gt;&gt; Oh, it be so good to leave church and say, "We won. &gt;&gt; We got a greater revelation of the word. We got a great enthusiasm. We got a greater we got a ra g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g greater determination to serve God with all my life. Wasn't that a good game? We won today. &gt;&gt; Not the preacher this and he could have done that and he should have used this example over here and that song lead. He kind of missed it on that song. Did you hear him hit the wrong chord? Stop that nonsense and get into the rhythm of what God's trying to accomplish in this day. &gt;&gt; All of that stuff is ruining, Amen. the purpose of God. criticism and critique and &gt;&gt; just say we won. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm rooting for my brother to win. I'm rooting for his home to win. I'm rooting for that one who's sick to win. Amen. I'm going to show up and I'm going to raise my voice. Amen. We might do a wave. Amen. And we're going to win. &gt;&gt; We can't lose. &gt;&gt; But it's got to be all of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Individually. Every gong banger, every trumpet player, every flute player, everybody who's got a part to play has got to play their individual part when the time comes for them to play their part. And when they're not playing their part, they've got to be in the in the music moving with it, tapping their foot to it. And when the when the obo plays, yeah, they did that right. That was good. Amen. We're coming to my part. &gt;&gt; Amen. Individual together, one individual as a body. Me. Amen. God having predestinated in me so that God can have predestinated in all of us so that God can show us super sign. &gt;&gt; So we have preeminence in us. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you two more quotes and then we'll stop. And what are we coming here for? What are we doing? Are we come here playing a game? Are we coming here meeting as a lodge? It's Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right. He's waiting on us. &gt;&gt; I believe we're at the end. &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't be waiting on me. Let me get into the rhythm of what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Says in 1959, he says, "And what was the Holy Ghost given for?" God's waiting on me and you. The church is waiting on me and you. Adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness, his power, his resurrection. that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And raises the dead and we go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; How's it going to happen? Amen. And until Christ, the church and Christ become so close together, till Christ becomes visible among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing it? &gt;&gt; He's here, friends. &gt;&gt; The power of the word is manifesting. It'll continue to manifest. This will never stop. Amen. This will never quit. It's promised that it won't quit. It won't stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get into the rhythm of the symphony of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His end time plan, his end time purpose, and what God is doing in this end time, and what he's doing with me in this end time symphony. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together. Musicians, please come. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I just want to ask you, are you tired of sitting like me at a NASCAR game? &gt;&gt; NASCAR game. It's not a game, it's a race. Shows you how good I am. Tired of feeling out of rhythm with everyone else around me. Listen, don't blame everybody else around you. &gt;&gt; It's that's easy. That's cheap. I don't I don't feel anything. I don't feel everything. I don't feel that's it's cheap to say everybody else is wrong. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why not digging down deep and saying, "God, I want to connect with you on a deeper level." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I want that personal individual thing that brings me right into harmony. I want to read from your sheet music. I want to catch what you're doing. I want to hear the rumbling and know, "Oh, that's just on time. That's exactly what he said." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to hear something said from a brother or sister said, "That's what brother Bam said in that mess." And that's that that's what he said would be in our day. And see a testimony, hear a testimony, and say that's exact. Now we're moving right in time with the sheet music. &gt;&gt; I want to be in rhythm with what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I want to devote my whole life to it. Give my whole time and attention to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I know you do, too. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. That's why we can't contain ourselves. That's why we get excited when we hear the word of God preached because we know it's absolutely the truth and this is the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't know how we're going to do it. We don't know how we'll accomplish anything. But we know one thing. It's prophesied to be done and it's in the sheet music. And if I stick with the sheet music, it's going to happen &gt;&gt; in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together and pray. Amen. Oh God, Lord, I want to say I love you, Lord. Your word is so powerful. It's so rich. It's so true. God, it's a power that's beyond intellect. It's a power that's beyond human. God, there's a supernatural power attached with this revelation. That supernatural power is working in our souls. It's bringing us to a place that you've predestinated for us to be. God, give us the courage, the ability, Lord, to sacrifice more of our life and dedicate ourselves more to this movement, Lord, to the movement of your word, to the cycles of it, to the beat and the measures of the symphony that you're playing. And God, let me play my part faithfully. And God, while I'm waiting to play my part, let me be engaged with every other part of the symphony, connected and attached and in harmony and unity in the rhythm of your beat so that I know what you're doing and I know where we're going and I know what parts being played. Lord, we love you, Lord. God, I pray you take this reality, Lord, that you've played out for us tonight or this morning. May it become a reality in every individual heart. God, we who have been distracted, forgive us, Lord. We who have put other things first, forgive us. We who got discouraged and disoriented and been wandering around aimless for a while, God, forgive us for that. Then bring us back into the rhythm of your word, Lord. God, help us to come back to our devotion, back to our sincerity, Lord, back to our focused attention, God, so that we may stay completely 100% in rhythm with the time of what you're doing. For God, we know you have to have a people to work through in this hour. You've promised it. And we want to be those people. God, I pray that you would take all that's been preached, all your prophet said, all we've preached for years, all we've heard, and bring it to a manifestation in our lives. God, it's a revelation. And the revelation is thrilling to us. but bring the revelation to a manifestation &gt;&gt; that this would become a living reality, a living word, not a word that's just believed, but a word that is acted out and demonstrated that it's alive in your living stones. God, we commit ourselves to you. I commit these people to you. We commit, Lord, everything we do to you. God, help us. Forgive us, strengthen and encourage us, Lord. inspire. I believe you've challenged us this morning. I believe you've inspired us in that challenge. May we come back to a first love. May we come back to one focus. May we come back to where this is the only thing that matters. Bring us Lord into that place where our foot is tapping in time again and our whole body, our whole being, our mind, our focus, our emotions, and everything is back in harmony with what you're doing in the message in this hour. through your people. God, carry us as we go. Bless us along our way. Thank you so much for your word. We're so grateful, Lord. Bless us, we pray, as we move and try to surrender in a greater way. Take that preeminence we're yielding to you and come and be the great one among us. Come Lord and be the super sign in these bodies of clay as we yield them to you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Like from glory to glory. He's changing me. Changing me. He's changing me. his likeness and image to perfecting me. The love of God shown to the world.
