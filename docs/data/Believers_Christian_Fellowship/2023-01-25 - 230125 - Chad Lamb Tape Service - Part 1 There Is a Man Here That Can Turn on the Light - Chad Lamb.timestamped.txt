[13:23] dear Lord we love you Lord Jesus and
[13:26] we're so thankful
[13:28] God that if we have a desire to see you
[13:31] it's because you want to unveil yourself
[13:34] to us Lord
[13:36] I pray that through the preaching of the
[13:39] word tonight Lord that you would unveil
[13:41] yourself to us
[13:42] that we can see you Lord as you are in
[13:45] this age you Lord in the
[13:47] eye Salve will be in anointing our eyes
[13:50] so that we can see
[13:52] Lord that the spiritual blindness will
[13:54] be cured by the word
[13:56] knowing that our spiritual Amnesia will
[13:58] be removed by the word
[14:01] God that will see you in our midst Lord
[14:03] unveiling yourself
[14:05] God I pray you'd have your way Lord as
[14:07] we listen to this message
[14:10] God I pray you'd give us a spirit of
[14:12] Revelation your spirit of Revelation
[14:15] that we can see you unveiling yourself
[14:17] scripture by scripture word by word that
[14:21] we can see ourselves identified with you
[14:24] we love you we ask your blessings over
[14:26] all we say and do this evening and Jesus
[14:29] Christ's name we pray amen amen God
[14:32] bless you we're going to let you have
[14:33] your seats for just a minute thank you
[14:35] musicians we appreciate your help
[14:38] once again we're going to do our winner
[14:40] tape service and this is something that
[14:42] I've grown to look forward to every year
[14:44] we've done it now for four or five years
[14:46] in a row I can't remember if this is our
[14:47] fourth or if this is our fifth and like
[14:51] I said on Sunday I always think oh I
[14:53] enjoy that so much we'll do another one
[14:55] and the year goes by so fast we never
[14:57] get a chance but I'm so thankful that
[15:00] we've we've done this and I'm I get
[15:01] excited about it I look forward to it
[15:03] it's amazing how it's there's always
[15:06] such an atmosphere when we listen to the
[15:08] message together and I I really like
[15:10] that and I just wanted to pull up a
[15:13] PowerPoint real quick and go over a few
[15:15] things and then we'll get into opening
[15:17] scripture and get into the questions as
[15:19] we normally do that
[15:21] but to um
[15:24] to to remind everybody of the the reason
[15:26] we started doing this initially several
[15:28] years ago uh when I started doing this I
[15:31] just had an inspiration and a desire to
[15:33] do this together as a congregation and
[15:36] one is because I really wanted to
[15:38] demonstrate to the younger ones those
[15:40] who are are getting interested in
[15:42] serving the lord and wanting to know the
[15:44] message for themselves when they get to
[15:46] that age of accountability and Beyond
[15:48] into the teenage years and they really
[15:50] start to feed on the word for themselves
[15:53] I just wanted to demonstrate to them
[15:55] through this how we glean from the word
[15:57] of God and how we take from the messages
[15:59] and actually grow in Revelation and
[16:01] understanding that we don't just play
[16:04] tapes as background noise it's not just
[16:06] something that plays off in the corner
[16:08] while we do something but this is
[16:10] something that God has given to us as a
[16:12] spiritual diet to grow us into the image
[16:15] he had of us before the foundation of
[16:17] the world so this is spiritual food and
[16:19] and so that's one of the reasons we
[16:21] wanted to do that but we enjoyed it all
[16:23] so much as a current education we just
[16:25] keep doing it so those of you who are
[16:27] coming into that age of accountability
[16:29] and Beyond amen this is a great
[16:31] opportunity just to see you know how we
[16:35] listen to the message to grow how we
[16:37] listen to the message to feed not just
[16:40] listening like we listen to any other
[16:42] program this isn't a program this isn't
[16:44] a radio broadcast amen this is the word
[16:46] of God that he's given us to us in this
[16:48] day and so be pay special attention I've
[16:52] got a few things I want to show you
[16:54] there's always those that are are new
[16:57] that maybe weren't here last year are
[16:59] always those that the younger ones like
[17:01] I said are coming up and becoming more
[17:03] interested in these things for
[17:04] themselves so I just want to go over
[17:06] real quick where The Book Rack is we've
[17:08] got the book rack out in the foyer as
[17:10] you head out the doors you can see it
[17:12] there there's 12 slots in there and we
[17:16] keep the the top section is a constant
[17:19] order of six books that never changes we
[17:22] don't rotate those titles out they stay
[17:24] the same and there's a reason behind
[17:26] that and when we first put the rack up I
[17:29] if you'll remember I asked the entire
[17:31] congregation everybody to read each of
[17:33] these books in this order in sequential
[17:35] order the order they are from left to
[17:37] right and I felt like that was really
[17:39] important for us all to be on the same
[17:41] page and we found out it was very
[17:43] beneficial these are those titles the
[17:45] spoken word is the Original Seed present
[17:47] stage of my Ministry is this the sign of
[17:50] the answer you'll see those are in 62
[17:52] then coming into 1963 the breach between
[17:55] the seven Church ages and the Seven
[17:57] Seals the seventh seal in Christ is the
[18:00] mystery of God revealed the reason we do
[18:03] that is because you can actually take
[18:06] those messages from 62 into 63 into the
[18:09] seals and you can follow the transition
[18:11] of brother Med in Ministry and catch the
[18:14] huge transition that's taking place amen
[18:17] and and it becomes very apparent and
[18:19] very obvious as you pull those
[18:21] selections out and it puts us all in the
[18:23] same frame of mind where we understand
[18:25] that now he's moving into the the
[18:28] seventh angel Ministry he's moving in to
[18:31] his commission Amen to reveal those
[18:33] Seven Seals those those mysterious
[18:35] Thunders amen and so it's a wonderful
[18:37] thing so we leave that there everybody
[18:40] you young people if you haven't done it
[18:42] I encourage you to take those six
[18:45] messages and read them in order so if
[18:47] you've never done it for yourself I
[18:49] encourage you to do that it'll really be
[18:51] a blessing to you and do it prayerfully
[18:53] and ask God for the spirit of Revelation
[18:55] to see what the prophet is trying to get
[18:58] us to see
[18:59] excuse me
[19:01] then this bottom section these six
[19:04] titles are constantly changing amen and
[19:07] every year when I do this I order six
[19:09] new books to go in there and so we've
[19:12] done the same thing this year we've got
[19:13] six new titles one of them is the one
[19:15] that we're doing tonight uh the title
[19:17] The Message there is a man here that can
[19:19] turn on the light so that'll be one of
[19:22] them but for the new books for this year
[19:24] are the one we're doing tonight there's
[19:26] a man here that can turn on the light
[19:28] who is this Melchizedek the
[19:30] identification of Christ in all ages
[19:32] modern events made clear by prophecy the
[19:35] seed is not air with the shuck and souls
[19:37] that are in prison now
[19:39] so these are six new titles that we
[19:42] haven't had in the library so when we
[19:44] started this we started with 12 books
[19:47] because we wanted the rack to be full
[19:48] and then they put the Overflow of those
[19:50] books in the library so year by year
[19:52] we've gotten more and I think last count
[19:55] we had I think we have something like 46
[19:57] or 48 titles in the library now with
[19:59] these new additions which means if
[20:02] you're here that you can easily have
[20:05] your own personal library of message
[20:08] books of 46 or 48 books
[20:11] and so I know everything's digital now
[20:14] and we have it on our phones and chips
[20:16] and all of that but there is something
[20:19] to be said for having a book and maybe
[20:21] I'm just starting to age I don't know
[20:23] but I I still like to have a book and
[20:26] you know I love to go into my children's
[20:28] rooms I love to go into their bedroom
[20:30] and see on their look on their shelf
[20:31] their own Library that's theirs they've
[20:33] read those books they've put marks in
[20:35] those books those are their books and I
[20:37] love that and and I think it's a
[20:40] valuable to take the time to go through
[20:42] the book and glean from it and you don't
[20:44] have to do it I mean there's no there's
[20:46] nothing that says it's not as effective
[20:48] an electronic form as paper form I
[20:50] believe the word's effective in whatever
[20:52] form that's not the point but I just
[20:54] it's it's it's nice to have to jot
[20:57] things down to highlight to go back over
[20:59] those things again it's nice to have
[21:01] your own books so just just one thing
[21:04] I'd like to ask you if you haven't had
[21:06] your own Library yet and you haven't got
[21:08] these books uh a young person or
[21:10] somebody that's in new
[21:12] I'd encourage you just to take one or
[21:14] two book at a time don't go in there and
[21:15] get 46.
[21:17] don't go in the Shelf with a basket and
[21:19] just get one of each because the problem
[21:20] is you won't read them all
[21:22] but if you get one or two at a time and
[21:24] don't get any more till you read this
[21:26] one or two then every book on your
[21:28] library is not just a book that you have
[21:30] as a book that you've read
[21:32] that's really important it's not
[21:34] important to have these books it's
[21:35] important to read these books and pray
[21:37] that God will reveal these books to us
[21:39] the contents and then the message so I
[21:42] encourage you just get one or two at a
[21:43] time and after you've read that get one
[21:46] or two more and before you know it after
[21:48] a year or two you will have your own
[21:50] library of books that you've read that
[21:53] you've put marks in that God has fed you
[21:55] from that you've grown and that your
[21:57] Revelation has grown and if you as young
[21:59] people coming up into that age of
[22:01] accountability or just before that or
[22:03] just beyond that if you'll do that I
[22:05] tell you you'll grow spiritually you'll
[22:07] be surprised at where you are after a
[22:09] couple of years
[22:11] so it's like anything else things we we
[22:13] want things to happen fast
[22:16] we want things changes in our life
[22:18] immediate we want fairy dust you know
[22:20] where something sprinkles down
[22:22] everything changed but there's changes
[22:24] that are happening in our life all the
[22:25] time and spiritual maturity that's
[22:27] coming and it's just like growing
[22:29] somebody says oh how did you get so tall
[22:31] you know you went you went from Tiny to
[22:34] tall in a year and everybody asked you
[22:36] oh you're growing how did you get so
[22:37] tall and you have no idea how you got
[22:39] tall you just ate and it happened
[22:42] well the same thing will happen
[22:43] spiritually if you keep eating you'll
[22:45] keep growing and people will notice that
[22:47] you're maturing spiritually and they say
[22:48] wow how did that happen I don't know how
[22:50] it happened
[22:51] it happened by feeding on the word and
[22:54] God changing me so I encourage you to do
[22:56] that if you haven't started developing
[22:58] your own library and reading these books
[22:59] I encourage you to do so or any books it
[23:02] doesn't have to be these you can read
[23:03] whatever on the tablet on your tablet or
[23:06] on your phone but I encourage you to
[23:07] just keep that steady diet of the
[23:10] message
[23:11] so in the library you can see here this
[23:14] is a picture of the library this is
[23:15] where all the books are you can go in
[23:18] there's no charge for anything in the
[23:20] library you're welcome to have it
[23:22] everything in the library comes out of
[23:23] the general fund so if you want to
[23:25] contribute to it just drop an offering
[23:26] in the Box in the journal fund and
[23:28] that's what covers it so you're welcome
[23:30] to have it you're also welcome to take
[23:32] books to share with other individuals
[23:34] it's not just for the individuals in
[23:35] this assembly but they're also for
[23:37] outreach if you have somebody you know
[23:39] would benefit from it give them a book
[23:41] they're not here to sit on our shelves
[23:43] to look pretty
[23:44] they're here to be fed upon Amen to be
[23:47] read to be used amen so Avail yourselves
[23:49] to that resource also we've got a new
[23:51] shelf we put up and the titles we got
[23:53] this year we've grown into that new
[23:54] shelf so hopefully over the next couple
[23:56] years we'll start to fill this shelf up
[23:58] too and have even more books available
[24:00] so that's where they are in the library
[24:04] okay for tonight we're going to go
[24:05] through the message there is a man here
[24:07] that can turn on the light from
[24:10] 1963. we have the books here this is
[24:14] what the book looks like if you haven't
[24:15] picked up a book yet there's a whole
[24:17] rack of them out here in the foyer of
[24:19] the church over there by the door we got
[24:21] I don't know 150 or 200 of them there's
[24:23] plenty for everybody so if you Devin got
[24:25] one you can slip out now and grab one so
[24:28] that you have your own book we're going
[24:29] to start at the beginning of this
[24:32] message but I want to go through the
[24:34] questions one thing that we've done if
[24:36] you haven't been here in the past when
[24:37] we've done that is I like to ask a few
[24:40] questions and have the congregation jot
[24:43] down those questions because as we read
[24:45] the brother Branham is going to answer
[24:47] those questions so the whole point is
[24:50] not just to read but to read to learn to
[24:52] read to grow to read to understand so so
[24:55] every time I pick up a book or I start a
[24:58] message whether it's electronic form or
[25:00] in paper one of the first things I do is
[25:02] I see when he preached this so brother
[25:04] Brandon preached this message right at
[25:06] the end of 1963 and we know 1963 is a
[25:10] pitiful pivotal year because of the
[25:11] opening of the seals right at the end of
[25:13] 1963 December 29th 1229 December 29th in
[25:18] the morning service that's what the m
[25:20] means in the morning service then I
[25:22] always look at the title and and I don't
[25:26] take the title lightly so there is a man
[25:29] here that can turn on the light
[25:31] oh when I read that I feel like
[25:33] preaching
[25:34] because brother random is titling this
[25:37] there is a man here
[25:39] that can turn on the light
[25:41] so if you've read this message or you
[25:44] know the message you know that is a
[25:46] super exciting title
[25:48] and I want to hold this title in my mind
[25:50] the whole time I'm listening to the
[25:52] message because what brother Branham is
[25:54] trying to share demonstrate teach has
[25:57] something to do with what he's titled it
[25:59] so I try to remind myself of this title
[26:01] throughout the duration of the sermon
[26:03] and that way I stay on track with what
[26:05] the prophet's trying to get me to see
[26:07] amen so there is a man here that can
[26:10] turn on the light
[26:11] so that's what he wants us to be aware
[26:14] of or to see that there is a man here
[26:16] present tense that can turn on the light
[26:19] I'll let you figure out who that man is
[26:22] all right let's open up the first cover
[26:24] to the first page you have the title
[26:28] page flip it over one time into the back
[26:30] side of the title page
[26:33] I go through this for the youngsters in
[26:34] our mix who may never have gone through
[26:36] the formatting of This Book of these
[26:38] books but these are the books from voice
[26:40] of God Recordings if you go to the back
[26:42] side of the title page it goes the title
[26:44] again it gives the date
[26:47] 63-1229 M and then has this statement
[26:50] this message by Brother William Miriam
[26:52] Branham was delivered on Sunday morning
[26:54] December 29 1963 at Branham Tabernacle
[26:58] in Jeffersonville Indiana USA
[27:01] I always look to see where brother Venom
[27:02] preaches the message
[27:04] because there's many times that brother
[27:06] Brown will be addressing something or
[27:09] phrasing something for the crowd that
[27:11] he's preaching to
[27:13] and and sometimes you'll say you know he
[27:15] doesn't say it like that in other places
[27:17] but he's using terms that the people can
[27:20] understand so if he's amongst
[27:21] Pentecostals if he's amongst an
[27:22] interdenominational sometimes he'll
[27:24] phrase things different or use phrases
[27:26] that they'll understand
[27:28] so so I like to see where he preached it
[27:31] so I want to know what who he's
[27:32] preaching to whether he'll be free or
[27:35] whether he'll be careful amen and things
[27:37] like that then it says this sermon
[27:39] number
[27:40] 63-1229 m is two hours and 29 minutes so
[27:45] I always look at all of that I know how
[27:47] long the message is I know where he
[27:48] preached I know when he preached it and
[27:50] I know the sequence of events because we
[27:52] know the message and I know the title so
[27:54] I begin to hold that title In My Mind
[27:58] so now let's go through the questions
[28:00] I'm going to ask five questions if you
[28:02] want to jot them down I'm going to put
[28:04] them on the overhead so you can write
[28:05] them down so the five questions are
[28:07] questions that brother Branham will
[28:09] answer throughout the message
[28:11] this message that we're listening to
[28:16] first question what is the subject that
[28:19] brother Branham is going to speak on so
[28:21] we know the title but he's going to tell
[28:23] us what his subject is
[28:25] what is the subject that brother Branham
[28:27] is going to speak on
[28:35] what is the subject that brother Branham
[28:38] is going to speak on and and I don't
[28:41] pull any tricks there's nothing tricky
[28:43] about the questions they're in
[28:45] sequential order he'll answer them in
[28:46] sequential orders we follow through the
[28:48] point is not to not to have an exam
[28:52] the point is for us to constantly be
[28:54] watching what's being said and gaining
[28:57] understanding by what he's saying is to
[28:59] be a careful listener that's the reason
[29:01] we do the questions to be a careful
[29:03] listener also it's a way for me to
[29:06] highlight things that are in the message
[29:07] that I believe to be important so what
[29:10] is the subject that brother Branham is
[29:11] going to speak on number two why is
[29:15] Christ a fugitive to his own church
[29:19] you can see each one of these questions
[29:22] could be a sermon
[29:24] there's so much to these why is Christ a
[29:28] fugitive to his own church
[29:30] also in asking the questions you can we
[29:33] can answer these questions all kinds of
[29:34] ways and be right but the point is how
[29:37] does he answer this question in this
[29:38] message as we're going through because
[29:40] he always gives us specific detail why
[29:43] is Christ a fugitive
[29:45] to his own church
[29:48] question number three how does light
[29:51] come
[29:55] how does light
[29:57] come
[30:11] and number four
[30:14] what does God do when he gets ready to
[30:16] use anything
[30:25] what does God do
[30:28] when he gets ready to use anything
[30:40] and there's five questions this evening
[30:42] question number five
[30:45] comes by what
[30:48] life comes by what
[30:52] now we're going to begin reading uh from
[30:56] paragraph one
[30:58] on the on the first page
[31:02] and I wanted to start brother Ben does
[31:04] some greetings he he says some things to
[31:06] his congregation there's a few minutes
[31:08] sometimes if this goes on for a long
[31:11] time we have quite a lengthy message
[31:12] sometimes we'll advance past that and
[31:14] get started more into when he starts
[31:16] with the scripture but tonight I just
[31:17] wanted to play it because it's only a
[31:18] few minutes and I love some of the the I
[31:22] would say the introduction part of
[31:23] brother Brenner's messages because you
[31:25] really get to see the character of the
[31:27] Prophet as he's speaking to his
[31:29] congregation talking about events that
[31:31] happened or people or or here he's
[31:33] talking about a member of the
[31:34] congregation that passed away and and I
[31:37] think it's very vital and very important
[31:41] um because once you see the nature of
[31:44] the man that God used and how that
[31:46] nature was developed you begin to see
[31:48] how gentle he is and how carrying he is
[31:50] and how he handles situations there's
[31:53] there's more to the message than just
[31:56] doctrinal teaching
[31:57] there's a lot more God even chose the
[32:00] vessel that he would use to present the
[32:02] message and that vessel had a certain
[32:03] character and certain characteristics
[32:06] and I think that's one of the most
[32:07] valuable things that we have in the
[32:09] recorded sermons is that we don't just
[32:12] get the highlights of Doctrine but we
[32:14] get the life that's on display from the
[32:16] prophet of the age and he's
[32:18] demonstrating Christ amen he's
[32:20] demonstrating Christ and bride form
[32:22] Christ and a son of God a redeemed Son
[32:24] of God and and he's been molded through
[32:27] the word and molded by the word and by
[32:29] the spirit of God and and it's now uh to
[32:33] me
[32:34] understanding if I could if I if I could
[32:37] put into words what's in my heart
[32:39] understanding and watching that nature
[32:42] is a safeguard against false Ministry
[32:47] because you can get doctrinal things in
[32:50] teaching and and things like that but if
[32:53] the doctrine and the teaching don't
[32:55] produce the life then what's the point
[32:58] of the doctrine in the teaching
[33:00] because we want we want the word amen to
[33:02] motives into the image of that word and
[33:04] that word is Christ and it should be it
[33:07] should make me like Christ and so if the
[33:10] vessel amen that that is bringing that
[33:13] teaching has not been molded or in the
[33:16] process of being molded so yeah I say
[33:18] this is a very dangerous because I'm in
[33:20] the process of being molded I hope I
[33:22] don't look at me I've not come to
[33:23] Perfection so don't judge everything by
[33:25] my lack of perfection but that word
[33:28] should be changing us
[33:29] it should be molding us into christ-like
[33:32] character that was on display so so you
[33:35] shouldn't see such a contradiction
[33:37] between the the the life and the
[33:40] doctrine they should come together like
[33:42] they did in the prophet
[33:43] and of course we're all on the journey
[33:45] and we're all growing and none of us
[33:46] have come to Perfection and we have to
[33:48] be patient with one another but I
[33:50] believe this is my personal feeling in
[33:53] my opinion but but to me it's been a
[33:55] safeguard against false because you see
[33:57] sometimes the false Doctrine will come
[33:59] with a certain personality slant or a
[34:01] harshness or a criticalness that just
[34:03] wasn't in the prophet
[34:05] it'll come with lack of love and it will
[34:07] come with or with with whatever but but
[34:10] to me that I'm not interested in that
[34:13] what I'm interested in is whatever it it
[34:16] takes to get this word to manifest
[34:19] inside of me
[34:21] to to become alive in me not in my mind
[34:25] but in my daily life I want to be
[34:27] changed by the word and so I think it's
[34:29] important to see the character of the of
[34:32] the prophet of God that his nature the
[34:35] nature that the word comes through and
[34:38] and I believe I I believe it's valuable
[34:40] because you can have things so right and
[34:44] come so hard and so cutting and so and
[34:47] you can deliver the right word with the
[34:50] wrong spirit
[34:52] and do a lot of damage
[34:54] and and I don't want any of us to fall
[34:57] subject to that I want the right word
[34:59] with the right spirit amen that's our
[35:01] desire that's our goal so I think it's
[35:04] important so it's just a few minutes and
[35:05] I wanted to hear some of them so we will
[35:08] begin on page one
[35:10] uh paragraph one and we will go to page
[35:15] we will stop on page 14 at the bottom of
[35:20] paragraph 80. so it'll be right at 40
[35:23] minutes just under 40 minutes tonight
[35:25] and then I will get up at the end and
[35:27] we'll go through our questions again
[35:30] before we do this I'd like to stand and
[35:33] read the opening scriptures together
[35:35] because once you get your book out and
[35:36] go through your notes it's hard to open
[35:38] your Bible so let's let's all stand and
[35:40] open our Bibles to the book of Isaiah
[35:42] and brother bear is going to open with
[35:44] two scripture readings it's wrote out in
[35:46] the message book so we can follow it but
[35:47] I want to read it from our own Bibles
[35:49] right now so Isaiah 42
[35:52] verse 1.
[36:03] Isaiah 42
[36:06] and verse 1.
[36:09] behold my servant whom I have uphold
[36:12] mine elect in whom my soul delighteth I
[36:15] have put I have put my spirit upon him
[36:17] he shall bring forth judgment to the
[36:19] Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up
[36:22] nor cause his voice to be heard in the
[36:24] street a bruised Reed shall he not break
[36:27] in the smoking Flack shall he not quench
[36:29] he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
[36:31] he shall not fail nor be discouraged
[36:34] till he has set judgment in the earth
[36:36] and the Isle shall wait for his law
[36:39] thus saith God the Lord
[36:41] he that created the heavens and
[36:43] stretched them out he that spreadeth
[36:44] forth the Earth and that which cometh
[36:46] out of it he that giveth breath unto the
[36:48] people upon him and spirit to them that
[36:51] walk therein I the Lord have called thee
[36:54] in righteousness and will hold thine
[36:55] hand and will keep thee and give thee
[36:58] for a covenant of the people for a light
[37:00] of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes
[37:03] to bring out the prisoners from the
[37:05] prison and and from and them that sit in
[37:08] darkness out of the prison house now
[37:11] let's turn to Matthew chapter 4.
[37:19] Matthew chapter 4
[37:22] and we'll begin reading from verse 12.
[37:27] Matthew 4
[37:30] and 12.
[37:34] now when Jesus had heard that John was
[37:36] cast into prison he departed unto
[37:38] Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and
[37:40] dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the
[37:42] Seacoast and the borders of Zebulon and
[37:45] Nephilim
[37:47] that it might be fulfilled which was
[37:49] spoken by Isaiah's the prophet saying
[37:51] the land of zebulun and the land of
[37:54] Nephilim by the way of the sea Beyond
[37:57] Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the
[37:59] people which sat in darkness saw great
[38:01] light and to them which sat in the
[38:03] region and shadow of death light is
[38:05] sprung up from the time Jesus began to
[38:07] preach and to say repent for the Kingdom
[38:10] of Heaven is at hand
[38:13] amen God bless you as you have your
[38:14] seats
[38:16] Amen brother Franco you'll go ahead and
[38:19] start the tape for us
[38:24] our heavenly father we thank thee this
[38:27] morning for thy goodness and mercy for
[38:30] giving us the privilege of ascending
[38:32] here together again

[38:38] eternity to worship the lovely one the
[38:41] Lord Jesus Christ
[38:43] we thank you because that he come to the
[38:47] Earth to redeem us from a life of sin
[38:50] and to give us this great heritage that
[38:54] we have through his righteousness as we
[38:57] this morning are here as his ambassadors
[39:01] to to break the spread of life to this
[39:04] waiting congregation May the Holy Spirit
[39:07] Inspire every word and place it into the
[39:09] hearts of the people just as we have
[39:12] been we ask this in Jesus name amen amen
[39:17] be seated
[39:23] certainly redeem this a great privilege
[39:26] again this morning to be standing here
[39:28] with you sorry that we don't have no
[39:32] more room than what we do to take care
[39:34] of the people our Tabernacle isn't quite
[39:37] large enough and we are very grateful to
[39:42] be here through this holidays from from
[39:44] down at our home at Tucson and the
[39:48] weather was kind of rough but we was
[39:49] happy to be here
[39:51] and I have the meaning now I want to
[39:54] announce that tonight there will be a
[39:56] healing service not our prayer for the
[39:58] sake and uh I told Billy just now he
[40:02] said well what will you do I said well
[40:04] maybe you better give out some cards
[40:06] tonight about 6 30.
[40:08] uh assaulted where the people won't I
[40:11] see it's so jammed in here we know just
[40:13] how to bring them one by one so you'd be
[40:16] called by the number of your card and uh
[40:19] so there won't be any congestion we can
[40:22] just call them one by one and let them
[40:24] go through the line as we pray for them
[40:26] so you if you're sick or have loved ones
[40:29] or sick and won't bring them in come
[40:31] about uh 6 30 something like that seven
[40:34] o'clock and get a prayer card you'll be
[40:37] at the door or however he gives them out
[40:38] as you come in
[40:40] and
[40:42] then
[40:44] this will probably be about the last
[40:46] time I get to be back for some time

[43:36] certainly had a real courage a real
[43:39] Christian law knowing that his little
[43:41] Queen is not dead she's alive for every
[43:43] morning
[43:44] and there will be a uniting time job

[43:50] me in the grave and keep me in a secret
[43:52] place until thou wrath be passed you
[43:55] ever notice God and nature does the same
[43:58] thing like the sap that's in the trees

[44:04] poured out upon the Earth see one time
[44:06] the Earth didn't have winter and in the
[44:08] Millennium there'll never be any more
[44:09] winners yeah so it's a wrath upon the
[44:12] Earth then when that happened see before
[44:15] the Wrath comes
[44:17] God in his Mercy sends that sap right
[44:20] down into the underneath the ground into
[44:23] the roots of that tree
[44:25] it keeps it there until the Wrath of the
[44:28] winter be passed then raises it back up
[44:30] again in the springtime all that thou
[44:33] would hide me in the grave and keep me
[44:36] in the secret place until thy wrath be
[44:39] passed amen that's what he's done for
[44:41] our sister that's what he does for all

[49:19] Alabama and Florida and through there so
[49:21] we'll be seeing you people down in there
[49:23] the Lord willing right away and then you
[49:27] keep praying for us and we'll let you
[49:28] know when the Lord puts upon our heart
[49:30] now to hold
[49:32] a few days here uh
[49:36] this coming summer I had a group of
[49:39] meetings scheduled and many of you in
[49:41] New York know when the vision come to
[49:43] say that those meetings in the
[49:45] Scandinavian country you remember them
[49:47] schedule in there then while I was in
[49:49] New York the vision came that every one
[49:52] of those meetings were canceled for some
[49:53] reason and I remember I told some of you
[49:56] here when I was in New York that's just
[49:58] exactly what happened because they all
[49:59] on the same day and couldn't get that
[50:01] building so that that might leave a
[50:03] little spot there in June it might be in
[50:05] the will of the Lord I was thinking
[50:06] maybe to come back for those trumpets
[50:09] right here before it's too late see so
[50:11] we know that everything works just right
[50:13] so that was all my heart so it might be
[50:16] what he wants us to do now
[50:19] uh see you're changing seats with each
[50:21] other and out in the halls and so forth
[50:23] we wish we just had a place to sit down
[50:25] and now when we have those trumpet sets
[50:28] we want to get the high school gymnasium
[50:31] yeah I think he sees 5500 and then we'd
[50:33] have a chance to everybody to have a
[50:36] seat and sound and listen quietly while
[50:37] we're while we're preaching or the
[50:40] trumpets they're very very fine uh
[50:43] looking at the other day see it on the
[50:44] Sixth Seal all seven trumpet sounds
[50:47] right there on that Sixth Seal thing
[50:49] just before the seventh seal opens the
[50:51] coming of Christ and tonight I have a
[50:54] very important message that I want to
[50:58] speak just before the the
[51:00] the healing service and if you're here
[51:03] and are going to stay over while we're
[51:06] trying if impossible to start just a
[51:08] little bit early because it'll be a
[51:10] prayer line it won't preach too long but
[51:12] there's something that I wanted to say

[52:35] told him under an oxygen tent in the
[52:37] name of the Lord I shake your hand and
[52:40] I'll see you in church again and shake
[52:42] your hand on the street the very next

[53:10] turn them on I want to start reading
[53:12] from Isaiah the 42nd chapter and the
[53:15] first and the seventh first and Matthew
[53:18] the fourth chapter beginning I believe
[53:21] 15 it's the 16th verse now in in the
[53:25] 42nd chapter of of Isaiah we're going to
[53:30] three
[53:33] behold my servant whom I uphold mine
[53:38] elect
[53:39] in whom my soul delighted I have put my
[53:43] spirit upon him he shall bring forth
[53:45] judgment to the Gentiles he shall not
[53:48] cry or lift up or cause his voice to be
[53:52] heard in the street a bruise read shall
[53:55] he not break and a smoking flag shall he
[53:58] not quench he shall bring forth judgment
[54:03] under truth he shall not fail nor be
[54:07] discouraged till he has have set
[54:10] judgment in the earth and the island
[54:13] shall wait for his laws thus saith the
[54:16] Lord
[54:17] he that created the heavens and
[54:19] stretched them out he that spread forth
[54:22] the Earth and that which cometh out of
[54:26] it he that giveth breath unto the people
[54:29] upon it and the spirit to them that walk
[54:32] therein
[54:34] I the Lord have called thee in
[54:37] righteousness and I will
[54:39] hold thine hand and will keep thee and
[54:43] give thee for a covenant of the people
[54:48] or a light of the Gentiles
[54:52] to open the blinded eyes to bring out
[54:55] the prisoners from the prison
[54:58] and them that set in darkness out of the
[55:02] prison house
[55:04] now in the Matthews gospel the fourth
[55:09] chapter I wish to read the Fulfillment
[55:11] of that prophecy given by Isaiah
[55:16] in the fourth chapter of Matthew
[55:19] um
[55:20] I will begin to read if possible let's
[55:24] begin at the 12th verses to the 15th now
[55:27] when Jesus
[55:28] had heard that John was cast into prison
[55:32] he departed into Galilee leaving
[55:35] Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum
[55:38] which is upon the Sea Coast and the
[55:41] borders of zabalin and Nephilim that it
[55:45] might be fulfilled which is spoken by
[55:47] Isaiah the prophet saying behold
[55:50] the land of zebra and the land of nephil
[55:53] by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan
[55:57] Galilee all the Gentiles the people sat
[56:01] in darkness Saul great light
[56:05] and to them that set in the regions of
[56:08] the Shadows of death light is sprung up
[56:10] and from that time Jesus began to preach
[56:14] and to say repent for the Kingdom of
[56:16] Heaven is at hand
[56:18] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[56:20] reading of his word and now
[56:24] odd little text that I heard someone
[56:27] speaking said this but I want to take
[56:30] this for a text
[56:31] there is a man here that can turn on the
[56:34] light
[56:35] and now we're going to speak on the
[56:38] subject of light this follows the three
[56:41] subjects that we have just been speaking
[56:44] on one of them in Tucson or Phoenix on
[56:48] why Jesus came by the way of Bethlehem
[56:51] that he must be because he is Bethlehem
[56:56] Bethlehem b-e-t-h's house e-l God
[57:00] e-h-a-m is Brad
[57:02] Bread House of God's bread and each
[57:06] Christian that's born in Christ is born
[57:09] in Bethlehem amen God's house of bread
[57:14] and then in their typing of David which
[57:18] was a fugitive at the time of his uh
[57:22] excommunicating from his people he was
[57:24] turned out and Bethlehem was besieged
[57:27] and the Philistines was garrisoned
[57:30] around Bethlehem
[57:32] and David a fugitive a type of the
[57:37] church today of Christ
[57:39] see Christ is a fugitive to his own
[57:42] church today they have a fugitive is
[57:45] something that's refused and David had
[57:48] been refused yet he was anointed to be
[57:50] king
[57:51] but the prophet had anointed him and
[57:54] during this time being a fugitive from
[57:57] his people he had picked up many Gallant
[58:00] Gentiles one of them killed 800 man one
[58:04] day with a spear or sword and another
[58:07] one jumped into a pit and killed a lion
[58:08] on a snowy day and and this Gathering
[58:11] little which is beans or peas or
[58:13] something and and all of them run away
[58:15] and he stood and killed mantle his arm
[58:17] got tired they also kill those giant
[58:20] Brothers of Goliath Gallop man holding
[58:23] to David because they knowed he was
[58:25] coming in power
[58:26] they know no matter what anyone said God
[58:30] had the anointing on David and they
[58:32] noted
[58:33] they were Gentiles no matter how much
[58:36] they turned him out they yet knew that
[58:38] he was coming to power amen and one day
[58:40] there what a type it is today of Christ
[58:44] a fugitive if you say Christ The
[58:47] Fugitive according to the Bible that we
[58:49] God is Godly taking us through those
[58:51] seven churches this lady of Sean Church
[58:54] Christ was a fugitive outside of his
[58:57] church rejected trying to get back in it
[58:59] amen he's a fugitive to his own church
[59:03] and the reason he is The Fugitive is
[59:06] because he is the word and they won't
[59:08] let the word in it except the Creeds
[59:10] instead we find out then that in this
[59:13] great struggle those got men around
[59:16] around David gentiles
[59:19] if you notice how Bethlehem is far going
[59:21] to get on that subject but how Bethany
[59:23] ham
[59:24] actually Rahab the Harlot her son was
[59:29] the one who founded Bethlehem it's a
[59:31] wheat Center and a lot of fine water
[59:33] there and he founded the little city and
[59:36] it was the smallest of all the cities
[59:38] because the prophet said out Bethlehem
[59:41] of Judea aren't thou the least amongst
[59:43] all the princes or the cities of
[59:45] Jerusalem or Judea but out of these
[59:48] shall come the governor yeah that'll be
[59:49] my people out of the little one David
[59:52] when he was selected up there the Greek
[59:54] Fine Brothers when the prophet Samuel
[59:56] went up to anoint all of us standing
[59:59] there great Gallup man looked like a big
[1:00:01] look at fine looking Kings but the very
[1:00:03] rejected one was the one David that had
[1:00:06] the aura poured right up on him the
[1:00:08] rejected city was the one that Christ
[1:00:11] it's a rejected that Christ picks up see
[1:00:14] the ones that's rejected then we find
[1:00:18] after he come over and after he come
[1:00:20] Boaz and there come another Gentile in
[1:00:22] which he come in by Ruth and out of
[1:00:24] there come just now just come David and
[1:00:27] a little Hillside stable out there
[1:00:29] brought forth the King of Kings Jesus
[1:00:32] Christ the son of David his spiritual
[1:00:35] son now
[1:00:37] then he was
[1:00:39] David himself being born in the city he
[1:00:41] had to come to this little spot and it
[1:00:44] was called Bethlehem which means the the
[1:00:47] house of God's bread and he is the house
[1:00:50] of God's bread David laying there on the
[1:00:52] hill that day and he looked down seen
[1:00:55] the Philistines garrisoned around like
[1:00:57] that it must have got hot and thirsty he
[1:00:59] said oh if I could just have a drink
[1:01:01] from that well once more while the least
[1:01:04] of his thoughts was a command to his
[1:01:06] them who loved him so is it today the
[1:01:10] least of Jesus thoughts or how about his
[1:01:12] word should be a commander we Gentiles
[1:01:14] who love him or we know he's coming into
[1:01:16] Power amen no matter how much he's
[1:01:18] rejecting Heaven's Earth will pass away
[1:01:20] but this will still Reign just the same
[1:01:22] or all heavens and earth is gone and we
[1:01:25] know he's coming into Power calls
[1:01:27] nothing will keep it from happening this
[1:01:29] is Christ the revelation of him and this
[1:01:31] is going to happen just the way the word
[1:01:34] says it is because he is the word
[1:01:36] and the least of his commands are no
[1:01:38] matter how little it is if it's be
[1:01:40] re-baptized or whatever it is we'll do
[1:01:41] it anyhow amen this is command and the
[1:01:44] least of David's thought was a command
[1:01:45] to those Gentiles or are they a type of
[1:01:48] the Gentile church today Gallant man see
[1:01:52] those men who stood by David were
[1:01:54] Gentiles but Gallant man they were
[1:01:56] Fearless they didn't know what fear was
[1:01:58] one man took a sword killed 800 man I'm
[1:02:01] all around him what a man that was
[1:02:04] one of them one other man is an Egyptian
[1:02:07] Warrior Run up with a long spear he only
[1:02:09] had a stick in his hand he took the
[1:02:10] stick and knocked the spirit's hand took
[1:02:12] Spear and killed him himself one of
[1:02:14] those giants had 14 inch fingers like
[1:02:16] that a 14 inches your fingers as long as
[1:02:19] your hand closed open that up that would
[1:02:21] be 28 inch hand
[1:02:23] and with a spear and jumped right in
[1:02:24] there and killed him see why he was a
[1:02:27] Gallup man a gentile looking up on
[1:02:30] anointed one that he know was coming
[1:02:32] into Power did you notice them being so
[1:02:35] Gallant to David when David finally come
[1:02:37] in power he made them ruler over cities
[1:02:40] then Jesus promise the same thing
[1:02:44] make him ruler then in there when
[1:02:48] David's desire was to have a fresh drink
[1:02:50] he probably had some old warm stagnated
[1:02:52] water up there he's drinking but he
[1:02:54] happened to think of that fresh water
[1:02:55] down there at Bethlehem the house of
[1:02:58] God's bread
[1:02:59] and he said if I only had a drink from
[1:03:01] that well and those men pull their sword
[1:03:04] and fought 15 miles of Philistines
[1:03:07] not because he asked him to but because
[1:03:10] they know he wanted it and they cut them
[1:03:12] Palestines all the way to the well while
[1:03:14] two of them fought the other and got a
[1:03:16] his bucket of water and fought their way
[1:03:18] back all the way back and handed to
[1:03:19] David
[1:03:20] talk about gallon David a godly man said
[1:03:24] God forbid that I would drink it from
[1:03:26] these friends and put their life in
[1:03:28] jeopardy and he made a drink offer
[1:03:30] poured it out up on the ground to the
[1:03:32] Lord give it to the Lord he's the one
[1:03:33] worthy of that not me but very type of
[1:03:37] Christ himself with his own eternal life
[1:03:40] with him but smitten Rock poured his
[1:03:42] life upon the ground as a sin offering
[1:03:44] for us that this word could live amen
[1:03:48] oh Gentiles as I have said who will pull
[1:03:52] that sword with me he wants a fresh
[1:03:54] drink this morning not this old
[1:03:57] stagnated church Creeds and things were
[1:03:59] fooling around with be more genuine
[1:04:01] faith in his words
[1:04:04] let's go to the well and bring back a
[1:04:07] drink a refreshment a worship that's
[1:04:11] built upon not crazy in a nomination but
[1:04:13] a genuine Spirit Worship with Christ
[1:04:16] among us living his life the way he
[1:04:18] wants to Among Us that's not with
[1:04:22] Credence different things that's just
[1:04:25] just having that way now
[1:04:27] the next was how God dealt with the
[1:04:31] people through a dream in the days of uh
[1:04:36] Joseph
[1:04:37] A Dream Is secondarily it's a secondary
[1:04:41] way of God where some people don't have
[1:04:43] dreams don't mean nothing you can eat
[1:04:45] too much and have nightmares and dream
[1:04:47] is the secondarily way see well why
[1:04:50] would God protect his own son through a
[1:04:52] secondary way he appeared to Joseph the
[1:04:55] welfare of his own child he sent in a
[1:04:58] secondarily way did you ever think of it
[1:05:00] cause there was no prophet in the land
[1:05:02] he had to work through dreams and it
[1:05:04] wasn't a dream that had to be
[1:05:05] interpreted
[1:05:07] the angel of the Lord said Joseph fear
[1:05:10] not to take an email why for that which
[1:05:12] is conceived in hers of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:13] is an unusual thing for that to happen
[1:05:16] Joseph being a just man he it was
[1:05:18] unusual God is unusual and the unusual
[1:05:22] is hard to understand that's why it's so
[1:05:23] hard to understand truth today is so
[1:05:26] unusual yeah a woman to have a baby
[1:05:28] without knowing a man that was very
[1:05:30] unusual but if you're honest and sincere
[1:05:32] God can appear to you yet in a dream
[1:05:35] that goes to show that anything that you
[1:05:37] have whether it's your mind where you
[1:05:39] can whistle sing testify or whatever you
[1:05:42] can do if your whole being is committed
[1:05:44] to God God can use it if you just let
[1:05:46] him do it
[1:05:48] then the following night up here brother
[1:05:50] Neville preached on the subject of
[1:05:54] escaping how the the man escaped and I
[1:05:57] thought it's kind of remarkable and this
[1:05:59] morning
[1:06:00] the Holy Spirit seems to have me to deal
[1:06:03] upon the subject of the light the very
[1:06:05] next go right on in the beginning how
[1:06:07] Christ's life started at the manger
[1:06:09] we're walking right back through it
[1:06:10] again in our text and he didn't know it
[1:06:12] I didn't know it and here it is right
[1:06:14] the same thing see right on the next
[1:06:16] thing is where he enters this ministry
[1:06:18] and tonight we got something to blend
[1:06:20] right with that to go right on tonight
[1:06:22] the Lord willing now great light the
[1:06:25] Gentiles you set in the regions of the
[1:06:28] Shadows of death great light spring up
[1:06:32] among them
[1:06:33] and Zebulon and Nephilim in the for the
[1:06:37] way of Galilee of the Gentiles great
[1:06:39] light they saw a great light
[1:06:43] now light
[1:06:45] the first time like we find in the Bible
[1:06:48] is found in Genesis 1 3 it was God's
[1:06:52] spoken word made the light that's right
[1:06:55] God said let there be light
[1:07:00] Genesis 1 3. and there was life
[1:07:05] I remember that light comes by the
[1:07:08] spoken word of God and light is the
[1:07:12] vindication
[1:07:14] are the subject that he has spoke his
[1:07:16] life
[1:07:17] when the light flies shows that God said
[1:07:20] let there be light there was no light
[1:07:22] and he said let there be light and there
[1:07:25] was light that's a proof the light is a
[1:07:29] Vindication of a spoken word same thing
[1:07:32] today amen a Vindication obvious spoken
[1:07:35] word
[1:07:36] now
[1:07:38] when you see his word
[1:07:40] being Vindicated or other words made
[1:07:43] known prove that is a the light of his
[1:07:48] spoken word and without light nothing
[1:07:51] can live
[1:07:52] without life there is no life upon the
[1:07:55] Earth today that but what has to come by
[1:07:58] the the light of the Sun in a botany
[1:08:01] life and so forth and there's no eternal
[1:08:03] life outside of the Son of God Amen he
[1:08:07] is the light now we find out I believe
[1:08:10] as we study now and uh this light the
[1:08:16] Earth was without form
[1:08:18] now some people argue today in our
[1:08:21] schools and so forth about the world
[1:08:23] being so many million years old and
[1:08:25] trying to condemn the Bible it say it's
[1:08:27] wrong they just don't never read the
[1:08:29] Bible That's all because the Bible don't
[1:08:32] tell us how old the world is the Bible
[1:08:34] said in the beginning God created
[1:08:37] heavens and earth period
[1:08:39] when how that's we don't know it
[1:08:41] now that's the first that's a period
[1:08:44] that's the end of that sentence in the
[1:08:46] beginning God created the heavens Earth
[1:08:47] it might have been 100 million or
[1:08:49] billion or whatever it was and how you
[1:08:50] done it that's up to him to know see not
[1:08:53] to me but the world or the Earth was our
[1:08:56] farm and void and the water was up on
[1:08:59] the the Earth and God said clued up on
[1:09:02] the water and said let there be light
[1:09:06] hey now
[1:09:08] I believe that the Sun and so forth was
[1:09:11] already in existence
[1:09:12] I believe the moon as it goes on Genesis
[1:09:15] 3 to explain it but I believe what was
[1:09:17] here that the world we is going to use
[1:09:20] it and therefore and it moved in there
[1:09:23] was fog missed all over the Earth making
[1:09:27] it dark and God said let there be light
[1:09:30] and the Darkness faded away and there
[1:09:33] was a cloudless sky
[1:09:36] that's God's way of doing things he in
[1:09:39] the Bible the next verse says the fourth
[1:09:41] verse says and he separated the light
[1:09:46] from the darkness
[1:09:47] and the light he called day and the dark
[1:09:50] as he called night and God's word always
[1:09:54] separates light from Darkness
[1:09:58] it's the word that does the separating
[1:10:02] light from Darkness God ever does the
[1:10:07] same thing
[1:10:08] when he gets ready to use anything like
[1:10:11] he got ready to use this old star or
[1:10:13] whatever it was this world he had to
[1:10:15] separate the light from the darkness
[1:10:17] when he gets ready to leave to use a a
[1:10:20] group of people he has to separate the
[1:10:22] light from the darkness when he gets so
[1:10:24] ready to use it individually he
[1:10:25] separates the light from the darkness
[1:10:29] light comes by God and the remember the
[1:10:33] light come by his spoken word
[1:10:37] the word of God said let there be light
[1:10:40] when there was no light yeah
[1:10:43] and he sent the light to separate the
[1:10:45] darkness from the light
[1:10:48] this word of command cleared the skies
[1:10:52] so the sun could shine in and his word
[1:10:55] today is what clears back all of the
[1:10:58] atmospheres of unbelief
[1:11:01] us talking I had to think 11 interviews
[1:11:04] just forgot to Pulpit this morning in
[1:11:06] there so bad the other day a little
[1:11:09] friend of mine Jim Poole his little boy
[1:11:11] I thought he had a heart attack rushed
[1:11:14] in the hospital was an ass minute
[1:11:15] condition it took a little fella he
[1:11:17] couldn't his little heart jumping and
[1:11:18] breathing and he's screaming and
[1:11:20] couldn't get his breath and little fell
[1:11:22] looked like he was dying when he got in
[1:11:24] here and I was fixing to go to the
[1:11:25] hospital they brought him here and took
[1:11:28] all his little hand I said what's done
[1:11:29] it measles has struck the kid and the
[1:11:32] measles the fever and struck the little
[1:11:34] fella you watch him in a couple days I
[1:11:36] want to see him again he'll be full of
[1:11:38] measles and here he is full of measles
[1:11:40] you see now what God separates Darkness
[1:11:46] from light or light from darkness and he
[1:11:49] separates death from life
[1:11:51] and he does it by his word his word is
[1:11:55] what always brings this forth now
[1:11:58] life well now the seed was already upon
[1:12:02] the earth I believe God had planted the
[1:12:04] seed and just as long as the son could
[1:12:07] get to that seed it began to grow and
[1:12:11] that's reason only taken days to bring
[1:12:13] forth these things because the seed was
[1:12:15] already in the Earth but only was life
[1:12:18] and that's why God has today his seed is
[1:12:22] already here his word the only thing it
[1:12:24] needs is light on him and he is that
[1:12:27] light amen for he is the word the word
[1:12:30] and the light is the same thing the life
[1:12:33] in there is a light of the word is the
[1:12:37] life The Germ of Life lays within the
[1:12:39] Grain and the grain the life is what
[1:12:42] breaks forth and brings forth the life
[1:12:44] out of the green that's why the Christ
[1:12:46] in the word makes the word do what he's
[1:12:49] supposed to do just like the life in the
[1:12:51] grain of wheat or whatever it is it
[1:12:52] makes the wheat do what it's supposed to
[1:12:54] do because it is the life that's in it
[1:12:57] all life so life is only by the word of
[1:13:01] God made manifest life comes only by the
[1:13:06] word of God made manifest as long as it
[1:13:11] is just in the book like this it still
[1:13:14] it can be questioned
[1:13:16] but when it's made manifest then you see
[1:13:19] the product of what is spoke of being
[1:13:22] manifested that that is light on the on
[1:13:26] the word see that's what brings the word
[1:13:28] said so
[1:13:30] and then when it comes to pass that is
[1:13:32] life in life light bringing life
[1:13:36] light brings life plank the weed out ear
[1:13:40] it'll put it in the basement cover it
[1:13:42] all over and it'll it'll never bring
[1:13:44] forth anything because it can't there's
[1:13:46] no light there but as soon as light
[1:13:49] strikes it then it'll bring forth life
[1:13:51] if it's a dermatized seed that's the
[1:13:54] same thing it is in the word see the
[1:13:56] word
[1:13:58] is God Among the life strikes it it
[1:14:01] brings it the light strikes it it brings
[1:14:03] the word to life again every age has
[1:14:06] always been that
[1:14:08] all how we appreciate these great things
[1:14:11] how that the word being Vindicated is
[1:14:15] the life of the spoken word amen see God
[1:14:19] said let there be light now what if he
[1:14:22] just said it until I come
[1:14:24] then we don't know it's true or not
[1:14:25] that's right we don't worry he's all
[1:14:27] right we don't know where he's God or
[1:14:28] not because he just said let there be
[1:14:30] and there wasn't
[1:14:31] see so then when God speaks and we see
[1:14:35] it is
[1:14:36] then that's the light that shines forth
[1:14:39] the truth all the words see there is
[1:14:41] light and light all natural life comes
[1:14:45] by his spoken word and the son is his
[1:14:48] spoken word he said he created great
[1:14:51] light in the heavens for the day and a
[1:14:54] lesser light for the night see and all
[1:14:57] natural life has to come by God's spoken
[1:15:01] word amen a fire cannot grow without the
[1:15:05] light of God's spoken word shine upon
[1:15:07] him for the son is the s-u-n is the
[1:15:11] spoken word of God when he said let
[1:15:14] there be life okay it's God's spoken
[1:15:17] life and no matter how much people try
[1:15:19] to to say this side or the other it
[1:15:21] Still Remains the Same you have to have
[1:15:23] that son so life natural can only come
[1:15:27] by the spoken word of God
[1:15:31] and spiritual life
[1:15:33] eternal life can only come by God's
[1:15:36] Spoken Word of Life
[1:15:39] life was a s o in this time in him is
[1:15:43] life and in him is no darkness and he is
[1:15:47] God's spoken light is that right God's
[1:15:52] spoken word or in the beginning why is
[1:15:54] the word the word is with God and the
[1:15:56] Word was God and it's forever God see
[1:15:59] and it takes the life of God to strike
[1:16:03] the word to make it live here's what he
[1:16:05] spoke now let the light shine let the
[1:16:08] light shine and the light will bring
[1:16:10] every word to its right position in a
[1:16:13] season amen
[1:16:14] amen glory oh you see when it comes time
[1:16:20] sometimes that green lays the Earth
[1:16:22] dormant all through the the winter I
[1:16:25] like to see the winter wheat sowed in
[1:16:27] the ground but when that sun gets just
[1:16:29] right
[1:16:30] oh it's got to live amen see and he
[1:16:33] can't live without the sun right and
[1:16:35] God's made promises for every age and
[1:16:38] every day
[1:16:39] and when the light gets right and shines
[1:16:41] upon that it'll produce just exactly
[1:16:43] what the word said because he is the
[1:16:46] light and the light God's word comes
[1:16:49] only by the Bible God's Bible is the the
[1:16:55] printed form of the Son of God because
[1:16:57] the Bible said that it is the revelation
[1:17:00] of Jesus Christ it's God revealing
[1:17:03] himself through Christ and Christ is the
[1:17:06] word and it takes the light of God to
[1:17:09] shine upon that word defindicated to
[1:17:11] prove that God still speaks life eternal
[1:17:14] life he speaks natural eye brings to
[1:17:17] life life only comes by the Light the
[1:17:21] word made manifests or made flesh when
[1:17:24] all the promises become uh in the Bible
[1:17:27] become manifest is when Jesus Christ the
[1:17:31] word was made flesh Among Us God always
[1:17:35] works through man
[1:17:37] man is God's subject
[1:17:41] wow we're just getting going
[1:17:45] but we've got plenty to get into
[1:17:47] the next time
[1:17:49] men so you can see brother Ben was just
[1:17:52] starting to get into a subject and
[1:17:54] that's our first question what is
[1:17:56] the subject that brother Branham is
[1:17:58] going to speak on so let's look at
[1:18:00] paragraph 34.
[1:18:03] this is a real simple one paragraph 34
[1:18:05] on page seven
[1:18:08] and he goes to the bottom of that
[1:18:10] paragraph he says for the take this for
[1:18:13] a text there was a man here that can
[1:18:14] turn on the light and now we're going to
[1:18:16] speak on the subject of light so his
[1:18:19] title is there's a man here who can turn
[1:18:20] on the light but the subject he's
[1:18:22] wanting to talk about is light and we
[1:18:23] saw that from the here on he starts
[1:18:25] talking about light so we want to look
[1:18:27] at that question number two why is
[1:18:29] Christ a fugitive to his own church
[1:18:31] let's look down at paragraph 38
[1:18:34] uh at the top of page eight the next
[1:18:36] page
[1:18:40] what a type it is today of Christ a
[1:18:42] fugitive you say Christ is a fugitive
[1:18:43] according to the Bible God has
[1:18:46] God has gallantly taken us through those
[1:18:48] seven Church ages this laodicean church
[1:18:50] Christ was a fugitive outside of his
[1:18:53] church rejected trying to get back in he
[1:18:55] is a fugitive to his own church and the
[1:18:58] reason he is a fugitive is because he is
[1:19:00] the word and they won't let the word in
[1:19:03] they've accepted Creeds instead
[1:19:06] so so no church there's no church that
[1:19:10] you can walk into any church that you
[1:19:13] walk into you can never say Christ is a
[1:19:16] fugitive outside this church and get
[1:19:17] them to believe it
[1:19:19] they think they're inviting Christ in
[1:19:21] they think they're believing in Jesus
[1:19:22] Christ my brother Branham is showing
[1:19:24] Christ is a fugitive and we find that in
[1:19:27] Revelations chapter 3 he behold he
[1:19:29] stands at the door and knock he's
[1:19:30] outside he's been put outside the church
[1:19:32] amen but the the the understanding in
[1:19:36] churches is that not that Christ is on
[1:19:38] the outside they don't understand how
[1:19:40] Christ is on the outside because they
[1:19:41] sing about Christ they preach about
[1:19:43] Christ they use the name of Jesus Christ
[1:19:45] all the time but brother Branham draws
[1:19:47] an equal sign between Christ and the
[1:19:49] word
[1:19:50] and when you take the Creed and reject
[1:19:52] the word you pushed Christ onto the
[1:19:54] outside and he says so now it's not just
[1:19:56] a denominational thing now it's us amen
[1:19:58] now anytime we take our own idea over
[1:20:00] the word we've rejected Christ
[1:20:03] and he can become a fugitive to our life
[1:20:05] is because we take our own idea and not
[1:20:08] the word
[1:20:09] so we don't want Christ to be a fugitive
[1:20:11] in this house
[1:20:12] in this church I don't want him to be a
[1:20:14] fugitive I want him to be welcome amen
[1:20:16] so I have to receive the word all of the
[1:20:19] word amen
[1:20:21] not my own Creed
[1:20:24] let's look at paragraph 45 at the top of
[1:20:27] the next page page nine
[1:20:30] so is it today the least of Jesus's
[1:20:32] thoughts or how about his word should be
[1:20:34] a command to we Gentiles who love him
[1:20:37] for we know he's coming into power so
[1:20:39] brother Branham now is talking he's
[1:20:41] typing the story of David outside
[1:20:43] Bethlehem longing for a Cool Drink From
[1:20:46] The Well of Bethlehem and those Gentile
[1:20:48] Warriors that were with him they cut
[1:20:50] their way through 15 miles of
[1:20:51] Philistines and come back bring him a
[1:20:53] water not in Brothers not because he
[1:20:56] asked them to
[1:20:58] but because that he desired it
[1:21:00] and now he's starting to show the
[1:21:02] Gentile way amen not the Jewish way to
[1:21:05] follow the law but the Gentile way is to
[1:21:08] love the Lord and want to do for him not
[1:21:11] keep a order
[1:21:13] this is such a higher order so he shows
[1:21:15] he said that David there as a fugitive
[1:21:18] is a type of Christ it's a type of the
[1:21:20] church Christ is a fugitive in the
[1:21:22] Legacy and church age but there's
[1:21:23] Gallant Gentiles Warriors that attach
[1:21:25] themselves to them because they know
[1:21:27] he's coming to power
[1:21:29] and so that's a type of us now on the
[1:21:31] last day were those Gallant Gentile
[1:21:33] Warriors amen because the fugitive has
[1:21:36] been pushed out but we've gone out to
[1:21:38] him and now we're living in the caves
[1:21:40] with him
[1:21:41] and now not not because it's a law not
[1:21:45] because I have to not because he said
[1:21:47] you better but as if I know his least
[1:21:50] desire that becomes a commandment to me
[1:21:52] and now I love him so much and recognize
[1:21:55] who he is that I will do the least of
[1:21:58] his desires becomes a commandment to me
[1:22:01] so I love the way brother bear types is
[1:22:03] and he shows where our heart should
[1:22:04] really be
[1:22:06] because our heart is not and tell me
[1:22:08] what the rule is and I'll keep the rule
[1:22:10] maybe for the sake of being safe behind
[1:22:12] the rule or being saved because of the
[1:22:14] rule now has nothing to do with the
[1:22:15] rules I recognize what this word is amen
[1:22:18] it's Christ and the least of his desire
[1:22:20] is my commandment now I do it not
[1:22:22] because I have to but because I want to
[1:22:26] so now we're going to read the next
[1:22:27] sentence for we know he's coming into
[1:22:29] Power no matter how much he's rejected
[1:22:31] heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:22:33] this will still Reign just the same when
[1:22:36] all heavens and earth is gone and we
[1:22:38] know he's coming into Power because
[1:22:39] nothing will keep it from happening it
[1:22:41] says brother brown patches Bible he says
[1:22:43] this is Christ so he's talking about his
[1:22:45] Bible this is Christ the revelation of
[1:22:47] him and this is going to happen just the
[1:22:50] way the word says it is because he is
[1:22:52] the word and the least of his commands
[1:22:54] there no matter how little is this if
[1:22:57] it's to be re-baptized or whatever it is
[1:22:59] we'll do it anyhow it's his command
[1:23:03] so you have people sometimes I mentioned
[1:23:05] this many many times but sometimes you
[1:23:07] have people when you're talking to them
[1:23:08] not necessarily even people believe the
[1:23:10] message but you're talking about the
[1:23:11] word and they'll ask you if that's
[1:23:12] Heaven or Hell issue will I go to hell
[1:23:14] if I don't do that and and for me that's
[1:23:16] always been the most mind-boggling
[1:23:18] question
[1:23:19] if you know God wants something why why
[1:23:22] do you ask if it's a heaven or hell
[1:23:24] issue if you know that's what God wants
[1:23:27] then don't you have a desire to please
[1:23:30] God
[1:23:31] isn't there something in you that that
[1:23:33] even if it's inconvenient for me even if
[1:23:36] I have to die to my own thinking even if
[1:23:37] I have to if it's painful for me in the
[1:23:40] flesh if that's what God desires then
[1:23:42] there's something in me that wants to
[1:23:44] give him what he desires and that's what
[1:23:46] these Gentile Warriors had
[1:23:49] so question number three how does light
[1:23:53] come so brother Brandon's subject is
[1:23:55] light then we want to know how light
[1:23:57] comes
[1:23:58] and let's look at paragraph 58
[1:24:03] at the top half of page 11.
[1:24:08] paragraph 58
[1:24:13] now light the first time light we find
[1:24:16] it in the Bible is found in Genesis 1 3
[1:24:18] it was God's spoken word made the light
[1:24:21] God said let there be light Genesis 1 3
[1:24:24] and there was light now remember then
[1:24:27] light comes by the spoken word of God so
[1:24:30] how does light come by the spoken word
[1:24:32] of God
[1:24:33] this becomes really important because
[1:24:35] the theme some things he's getting ready
[1:24:36] to say
[1:24:38] and light is the Vindication or the
[1:24:41] subject that he has spoke as light and
[1:24:43] when light flies shows that God said let
[1:24:45] there be light there was no light and he
[1:24:47] said let there be light and there was
[1:24:49] light that's a proof the light is a
[1:24:51] Vindication of his spoken word same
[1:24:53] thing today a Vindication of a spoken
[1:24:56] word
[1:24:57] now when you see his word being
[1:24:59] Vindicated or other words made known
[1:25:01] prude that is the light of his spoken
[1:25:04] word and without light nothing can live
[1:25:07] without light there is no life upon the
[1:25:09] Earth today that but that has to come by
[1:25:12] the Light of the sun and a botany life
[1:25:15] and so forth and there is no eternal
[1:25:16] life outside the Son of God see he is
[1:25:19] the light
[1:25:21] so there is no life without that light
[1:25:23] both naturally and spiritually so life
[1:25:27] must come by the spoken word and when
[1:25:29] that word is Vindicated or proved or
[1:25:32] made manifest then that is light and
[1:25:34] that light brings life so you have to
[1:25:37] have the light of the spoken word or the
[1:25:40] word made manifest to have life
[1:25:43] that becomes so critical because that
[1:25:46] there's there's there's uh as many
[1:25:49] church denominations as you want to
[1:25:50] mention and churches on every street
[1:25:52] corner but how many are bringing life
[1:25:54] because life must come by the spoken
[1:25:56] word made Vindicated
[1:26:00] that's we want to be in life amen and
[1:26:03] light brings life
[1:26:06] question number four
[1:26:08] what does God do when he gets ready to
[1:26:10] use anything
[1:26:12] paragraph 65 at the top of page 12.
[1:26:18] paragraph 65.
[1:26:22] and I believe that's God's way of doing
[1:26:24] things in the Bible the next verse says
[1:26:26] the fourth verse says and he separated
[1:26:27] the light from the darkness and the
[1:26:29] light he called day in the darkness he
[1:26:31] called night and God's word always
[1:26:33] separates light from Darkness it's the
[1:26:35] word that does the separating see light
[1:26:37] from Darkness
[1:26:39] God God ever does the same thing when he
[1:26:43] gets ready to use anything so what does
[1:26:46] God do whenever he gets ready to use
[1:26:48] anything God separates light from
[1:26:50] Darkness
[1:26:51] like he's got ready to use this old Star
[1:26:54] War whatever it was this world he had to
[1:26:57] separate the light from the darkness
[1:26:58] when he gets ready to leave or to use a
[1:27:01] group of people he has to separate the
[1:27:03] light from the darkness when he gets
[1:27:05] ready to use an individual he separates
[1:27:07] the light from the darkness
[1:27:10] lights come by God remember the light
[1:27:12] come by his spoken word the word of God
[1:27:14] said let there be light then there was
[1:27:16] no light and he sent the light to
[1:27:18] separate the darkness from the light
[1:27:20] this word of command cleared the sky so
[1:27:24] the sun sun could shine in and his word
[1:27:27] today is what clears back all the
[1:27:29] atmospheres of unbelief
[1:27:31] let's skip down to paragraph 71 at the
[1:27:34] bottom of the page now what God
[1:27:36] separates Darkness from light or light
[1:27:38] from darkness and he separates death
[1:27:40] from life and he does it by his word his
[1:27:44] word is what always brings forth
[1:27:46] So Gone first thing he did was he spoke
[1:27:49] and when he spoke it became manifest or
[1:27:52] it was proven or became light when the
[1:27:55] light was the manifestation of the
[1:27:57] spoken word and that light is the as the
[1:28:00] word made flash actually separated the
[1:28:02] darkness from the light it was the word
[1:28:04] that did it
[1:28:05] when the word was made manifest it
[1:28:08] automatically separated light from dark
[1:28:11] so we say if any time God's going to use
[1:28:13] anybody he first separates the light
[1:28:15] from the dark so I've got to separate
[1:28:17] light from dark in my life no you don't
[1:28:19] have to separate light from dark in your
[1:28:20] life all you have to do is receive the
[1:28:22] light the light itself will separate
[1:28:24] light from dark
[1:28:25] there's nothing for you to do but
[1:28:27] receive the light yield to the light
[1:28:29] recognize the light acknowledge the
[1:28:32] light and walk in the light and the
[1:28:34] light will separate the light from the
[1:28:36] darkness
[1:28:37] so many times we try to clean ourselves
[1:28:39] up then serve God
[1:28:42] how about just serve God and let the
[1:28:44] light do the separating
[1:28:47] praise God
[1:28:48] that's the power of the spoken word
[1:28:51] all right question number five
[1:28:54] life comes by what
[1:28:57] so he's already alluded to this let's
[1:28:58] look at middle of page 13.
[1:29:01] paragraph 74.
[1:29:04] so life is only by the word of God made
[1:29:08] manifest oh praise God aren't you glad
[1:29:11] you live in the day when the word of God
[1:29:13] has been made manifest and you can have
[1:29:15] Life By the Light of the word amen not
[1:29:18] dead denominationalism not darkness of
[1:29:21] Creeds and dogmas but there's been a
[1:29:23] revelation that has manifest itself in
[1:29:25] this day that brings light and light
[1:29:27] brings life
[1:29:29] so now we can have life
[1:29:32] amen oh praise God
[1:29:35] so life is only by the word of God made
[1:29:37] manifest life comes only by the word of
[1:29:40] God made manifest I love how he said
[1:29:42] that only life comes only by the word of
[1:29:45] God made manifest as long as it's it is
[1:29:48] just in book like this it still can be
[1:29:50] questioned but when it's made manifest
[1:29:53] then you see the product of what it
[1:29:54] spoke of being manifested then that is
[1:29:57] light on the word that that what brings
[1:30:00] the word said so and then when it comes
[1:30:02] to pass that is life and light light
[1:30:06] brings Life Light brings life
[1:30:10] do you want to come to life
[1:30:12] then you've got to get in the light what
[1:30:14] is the light the word made manifest in
[1:30:16] this day
[1:30:17] The Living Word is light and light
[1:30:20] brings life look at paragraph 75 plant
[1:30:24] the wheat out here
[1:30:25] and put it in the basement cover it all
[1:30:27] over it'll never bring forth anything
[1:30:29] because it can there's no light there
[1:30:31] but as soon as light strikes it then
[1:30:33] it'll bring forth life if it's a
[1:30:35] dermatized seed so now we we talk about
[1:30:38] the wheat the the and brother bam talks
[1:30:40] many times about the wheat being a type
[1:30:42] of the word it's it's symbolic of the
[1:30:44] word you can take that word amen and
[1:30:47] hide it away from the Sun and it'll
[1:30:49] never reproduce it'll never spring forth
[1:30:51] to life amen Buddha when it gets in the
[1:30:53] sun especially when it gets in the right
[1:30:55] kind of sun for that crop
[1:30:58] but that way because wheat comes to life
[1:31:00] at a certain time amen corn at another
[1:31:02] time beans at another time but when it
[1:31:05] gets in the right sunlight for the
[1:31:06] condition for it to grow and to ripen
[1:31:08] amen it brings forth life out of that
[1:31:11] seed amen but that seed must be in
[1:31:14] contact it must be in the light
[1:31:16] so you can have the word amen but to
[1:31:19] make the word live it takes the light of
[1:31:21] the Vindicated word to make the word
[1:31:22] live why is that so important because in
[1:31:25] you is word
[1:31:27] there's a sieging of God there's a part
[1:31:29] of the word laying in you amen part of
[1:31:32] the wheat seed and it has to come to
[1:31:34] life but it can't come to life until it
[1:31:36] gets in the light and the light is the
[1:31:38] word made manifest which is the message
[1:31:40] of the hour
[1:31:42] and that will bring you to life
[1:31:45] that's really what he's talking about
[1:31:48] all right let's look at paragraph 77.
[1:31:52] all natural life comes by a spoken word
[1:31:57] I'm sorry let's go back up and finish
[1:31:58] paragraph 75 I read the first part of it
[1:32:01] and let's read the second part that's
[1:32:03] the same thing it is in the word see the
[1:32:06] word is God
[1:32:08] I thought he said earlier that the word
[1:32:09] is Christ
[1:32:11] Sarah said the word is God
[1:32:14] are we confused or do we see it
[1:32:17] amen the word is God and when the life
[1:32:20] strikes it the light strikes it it
[1:32:23] brings the word to life again every age
[1:32:25] has always been them oh how we
[1:32:27] appreciate these great things how the
[1:32:30] word being Vindicated is the light of
[1:32:32] the spoken word God said let there be
[1:32:34] light now down to paragraph 77 all
[1:32:37] natural life comes by his spoken word
[1:32:40] and the Sun is the spoken word he said
[1:32:43] he created a great light in the heavens
[1:32:45] for the day and a lesser light for the
[1:32:46] night and all natural life has to come
[1:32:49] by God's spoken word a flower cannot
[1:32:51] grow without the light of God's spoken
[1:32:53] word
[1:32:54] to shine upon it for the son as the
[1:32:57] s-u-n is the spoken word of God when he
[1:33:00] said let there be light see it's God's
[1:33:02] spoken life and no matter how much
[1:33:04] people try to say this that or the other
[1:33:06] it Still Remains the Same you have to
[1:33:08] have that son so life natural can only
[1:33:11] come by the spoken word of God and the
[1:33:15] spiritual life eternal life can only
[1:33:17] come by God's Spoken Word of Life life
[1:33:19] was the son this time in him is light
[1:33:23] and in him is no darkness and he is
[1:33:25] God's spoken light is that right God's
[1:33:28] spoken word for in the beginning was the
[1:33:30] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:33:32] Word was God and it's forever God
[1:33:36] so is the word forever God
[1:33:38] and is the word Christ
[1:33:42] and it takes the light of God to strike
[1:33:45] the word to make it live
[1:33:47] it takes the light of God to strike the
[1:33:49] word to make it live
[1:33:51] what is the light of God the word made
[1:33:53] manifest for your day
[1:33:55] has to strike the word for this day
[1:33:57] which is you to make it live
[1:34:00] that's why you can't come to life a seed
[1:34:03] for this day cannot come to life without
[1:34:05] the message of the hour
[1:34:07] it is the light for the age that brings
[1:34:10] life
[1:34:14] praise God
[1:34:18] let's read
[1:34:20] let's keep reading
[1:34:22] and it takes the light of God to strike
[1:34:23] the word to make it live here is what he
[1:34:26] spoke
[1:34:27] referring to the Bible now let the light
[1:34:29] shine amen let the light shine and the
[1:34:32] light will bring every word to its right
[1:34:34] position in its season
[1:34:38] there you got it
[1:34:40] the light will bring every word to its
[1:34:44] position in its season
[1:34:46] you can say God what am I supposed to do
[1:34:48] what's my existence upon the Earth what
[1:34:50] do you want me to do just lay in the
[1:34:52] presence of the sun and the sun will
[1:34:54] bring every seed to its right position
[1:34:57] whatever God has ordained for you to do
[1:35:00] you will do when you stay in the light
[1:35:03] the light will bring the life out of the
[1:35:06] seed into full maturity and it will
[1:35:08] manifest itself
[1:35:10] so we don't look for something to do we
[1:35:13] don't ask God what to do and try to find
[1:35:15] a work to do or a calling or a
[1:35:17] commission we just walk in the light as
[1:35:19] he's in the line that light will bring
[1:35:22] the life out of the scene
[1:35:24] so stay with the light it'll do
[1:35:26] everything it's supposed to do
[1:35:29] so light will bring every word to its
[1:35:32] right position in its season when it
[1:35:35] comes time
[1:35:36] sometimes that grain lays in the earth
[1:35:38] dormant all through the winter like seed
[1:35:40] winter wheat sowed in the ground but
[1:35:42] when the sun gets just right it's got to
[1:35:44] live and it can't live without the Sun
[1:35:48] so sometimes you can you can live a long
[1:35:51] time with a seed in your life and that
[1:35:53] seed never Springs forth to life until
[1:35:55] you get in the right light amen and the
[1:35:58] right light in the right season in the
[1:35:59] right time which is the message of the
[1:36:01] hour will hit the right seed that needs
[1:36:03] that condition to come to life and it'll
[1:36:06] spring forth to life
[1:36:08] praise God
[1:36:10] paragraph 80.
[1:36:12] God's word comes only by the Bible
[1:36:16] God's Bible is the printed form of the
[1:36:19] son of God
[1:36:20] because the Bible said that it is the
[1:36:22] revelation of Jesus Christ it's God
[1:36:24] revealing himself through Christ and
[1:36:27] Christ is the word
[1:36:29] I thought God was the word
[1:36:31] I thought the word is forever God
[1:36:34] and it's Christ
[1:36:36] is the word and it takes the light of
[1:36:39] God to shine upon that word to vindicate
[1:36:41] it to prove that God still speaks life
[1:36:45] eternal life he speaks natural light
[1:36:47] brings to life life only comes by the
[1:36:50] Light the word made manifest or made
[1:36:54] flesh
[1:36:55] life only comes by the Light which is
[1:36:58] the word made flesh
[1:37:01] when all the promises become in the
[1:37:03] Bible become manifest is when Jesus
[1:37:05] Christ the word was made flesh Among Us
[1:37:07] God always works through man man is
[1:37:11] God's subject
[1:37:13] there you got it
[1:37:15] so if God is going to show manifested
[1:37:18] light in this day how will he do it
[1:37:21] he just told you God always works
[1:37:23] through man
[1:37:24] and man is God's subject
[1:37:26] so therefore the commission is to you
[1:37:29] and I who have received this word and
[1:37:31] come to life the commission has arise
[1:37:34] Shine for thy light has come
[1:37:37] now the light is to shine out of us
[1:37:40] as the Bride of Jesus Christ and that
[1:37:43] light being the manifested word can
[1:37:45] bring another seed to life when it comes
[1:37:48] in contact
[1:37:49] with that light
[1:37:51] amen let's all stand
[1:37:56] these are
[1:37:57] I went through this message just myself
[1:37:59] studying it back sometime in the summer
[1:38:02] and that's when I decided to do it as
[1:38:04] our tape service because these things
[1:38:07] started striking me with such impact
[1:38:09] brother Benham kind of quickly goes to
[1:38:11] this concept and he starts talking about
[1:38:12] light and life brings life and life and
[1:38:15] the light brings to seed to life but
[1:38:18] when you really stop and meditate on
[1:38:19] what he's saying you realize the impact
[1:38:21] of what it means to have the word made
[1:38:24] manifest in our day
[1:38:26] is the it brings the possibility of the
[1:38:30] word coming to life
[1:38:32] of the seed coming to life without it
[1:38:35] that's why the the
[1:38:38] when the church is rejected Christ in
[1:38:40] this day they put the light away from
[1:38:43] them
[1:38:44] and light separates Darkness from line
[1:38:46] that's why you can't stay in the system
[1:38:48] or your own system or separated from the
[1:38:50] light in any way whether in another
[1:38:52] church or in your own mind
[1:38:55] you can't stay separated from the light
[1:38:57] and expect to come to life
[1:38:59] we can only come to life amen when we
[1:39:02] stay in the presence of the sun and the
[1:39:04] sun brings the word that's in us to life
[1:39:08] and then all of a sudden when you
[1:39:10] realize what this is we become so
[1:39:12] grateful that God has rescued us out of
[1:39:14] the darkness amen because where did
[1:39:16] laodicea go it went into a total
[1:39:18] blackout amen is signified by the
[1:39:21] blackout of the moon and the eclipse the
[1:39:22] seventh picture wasn't even in the paper
[1:39:24] because it was totally black showing
[1:39:26] that the church has gone into apostasy
[1:39:28] we could never come to life there we had
[1:39:31] to come to life under the word for our
[1:39:33] day
[1:39:35] and all of a sudden all I can say is
[1:39:37] thank you God because I had no power to
[1:39:40] produce the light
[1:39:42] I had nothing in me that could make the
[1:39:45] light to shine to bring what was buried
[1:39:47] deep inside of this Earth to life amen
[1:39:49] and and who knew that laying under this
[1:39:52] part of dirt was life
[1:39:55] just like you go he types it with the
[1:39:57] creation amen back in Genesis 1 there's
[1:39:59] dirt everywhere who knows where there's
[1:40:02] germinated seed laying amen who knew who
[1:40:05] could walk and say there's a palm tree
[1:40:07] there's an oak tree this spot here who
[1:40:10] would know but God but God was going to
[1:40:12] show where the seed was and the way he
[1:40:14] would manifest the seed was to shine the
[1:40:17] light and when he shined the light it
[1:40:19] would manifest the seed
[1:40:22] so who knew that in Lima Ohio or
[1:40:25] Cincinnati Ohio or Lebanon Ohio or
[1:40:28] wherever you happen to be to be who knew
[1:40:30] that down in that patch of dirt was a
[1:40:32] seed amen who knew there was a sieging
[1:40:35] of God who could point and say that's
[1:40:37] one and that's nobody could you were
[1:40:39] just dead earth like the the beginning
[1:40:42] at the beginning of Genesis
[1:40:46] but God shined the light in this day
[1:40:48] through the message of the hour and when
[1:40:50] you came in contact with that line he
[1:40:52] showed where his seed was
[1:40:54] it was laying in that patch of dirt
[1:40:56] there and that patch of dirt there and
[1:40:58] that patch of dirt there and it wasn't
[1:41:00] because we decided to be something it
[1:41:02] wasn't because we changed our mind it
[1:41:04] was because he planted that seed in this
[1:41:06] dirt before the foundation of the world
[1:41:08] and he made the light to shine we didn't
[1:41:10] make the light to shine and that light
[1:41:13] began to pull something out of the seed
[1:41:18] it wasn't what we did
[1:41:20] it's what we surrendered ourselves to
[1:41:23] that's what the word did
[1:41:25] the word that was shining in this day
[1:41:27] and the word that was trapped in my
[1:41:29] heart
[1:41:31] the word brought the word to life
[1:41:34] the light brought life and the life
[1:41:38] brings light
[1:41:40] and we didn't do anything
[1:41:42] we were just here
[1:41:45] oh aren't you grateful for the message
[1:41:47] aren't you thankful for the word of God
[1:41:50] this is so much more than a an
[1:41:54] interesting sermon and an acute title
[1:41:57] there is a man here
[1:41:59] not only that can't turn on the light
[1:42:01] there's a man here who has turned on the
[1:42:02] lights
[1:42:04] and the light is shining for those who
[1:42:06] can see it
[1:42:08] and that light is here to bring a
[1:42:10] certain seed for a certain season to
[1:42:12] life
[1:42:14] receive the light and let it bring the
[1:42:17] seed in you to life
[1:42:20] and the same light that caused it to
[1:42:22] Spring forth is the same spoken word
[1:42:25] light that'll bring it to full maturity
[1:42:27] and have that seed bearing fruit
[1:42:30] and all you have to do is stay in the
[1:42:34] light
[1:42:35] amen
[1:42:37] let's bow our heads musicians if you can
[1:42:39] come and blink if you can come dear
[1:42:41] heavenly father we thank you so much for
[1:42:43] this message Lord
[1:42:45] God it seems so trivial to say that just
[1:42:48] thank you but from the depths of our
[1:42:50] heart
[1:42:51] we thank you
[1:42:52] I can never Lord have done anything for
[1:42:55] myself I could have never done anything
[1:42:57] to help myself

[1:44:12] separate the light from the darkness in
[1:44:14] US
