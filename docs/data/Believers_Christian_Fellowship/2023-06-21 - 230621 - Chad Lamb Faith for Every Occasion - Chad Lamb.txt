Hebrews chapter 11. we'll just read one verse together or two and then we'll take our seeds Hebrews 11 and 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the the elders obtained a good report amen God bless you as you take your seats amen before we pull up the PowerPoint you can go ahead and pull up the PowerPoint but Frank if you want but I had an announcement to make I didn't want to forget that uh brother Levi Yoder uh from over in near Holmes County he called me last week and I was First supposed to make an announcement on Sunday and I forgot but they're building a church over there that they're building a message church over there and they want it to evangelize to all the Amish in the area and then Gathering a small group of Believers and they're working on the church they already when I was there a few weeks ago they already had the foundation in they they got some of the poured walls done so they're having a work day this Saturday June 24th and they want to invite any of the brothers in the church that would like to come he called it a framing and Roofing Frolic so if you want to go on a framing and Roofing Frolic you're invited for the framing and Roofing Frolic this Saturday they're going to start early in the morning and they're going to be serving lunch they'd like to get a number of people who'd like to go so if you think that you would like to go and you plan on going I know it's late notice and that's my fault but if you'd like to go and have a desire to go if you could just let me know send me a text or a call so that I can maybe by Friday get him a number of people who would possibly be coming over but all are welcome and and they're going to have some I think from The Junction City Group come some of the local Believers from the area so it'll be a nice time a fellowship and see what the Lord is doing there is pretty amazing so all are welcome I also wanted to remind you of the bible study this Friday with Brother Kyle don't forget that and also I'd like to welcome home three young ladies Abby and Amber Levy and Brianna lamb we're glad that you're back from Germany they were going three weeks they were over visiting our sister Isabella and meeting some of the Saints over there seeing the size they had a good time the Lord took care of them but your seats have been holes empty gaps and we're glad that they're filled now amen God is good amen if we could look at this subject for tonight faith for every occasion this will tie in with the last the previous two Wednesdays we've had last Wednesday and then the Wednesday before that we've been talking kind of in the same thing along the same lines starting with faith is a mystery a couple weeks ago then then bearing his name last Wednesday and we want to continue on with this thought as the Lord will help us amen I put it in a PowerPoint because I want to go through several quotes and I want to do it quickly um to save time and I want everybody to be able to read it together but when we look at this scripture now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report this is coming from Hebrews chapter 11 which is we it's called sometimes the faith chapter of the Bible or the hall of fame or the chapter of the Hebrews of the or the heroes of the faith and so we want to look at chapter 11. I'm going to spend a lot of time in chapter 11. so if you want to keep your Bibles open to that amen will spend some time in Hebrews chapter 11 this evening now it says faith is the sub substance it's interesting when I looked up this word substance in the concordance it's actually translated a few other places in the Bible as confidence uh or to be confident so faith is substance it's substance but it's also a confidence amen and and when you get into the definition in the concordance it says a setting or placing under a thing put under a substructure or a foundation and I love that definition amen so we know faith is a substance and we know what a substance is it's something firm it's something solid it's something real it's not imaginary it's not a figment of our imaginations amen but faith is an actual substance but it's also something you can have confidence in it's a substructure or a foundation amen praise be to God it's real amen but it's not just real it's foundational It's Got Roots amen you can you can you can you can Bank on it amen it also means another definition means that which has actual existence amen this is so many times amen faith is treated faith is treated as in something that's Whimsical or something that is a thought or something that just transpires in the mental realm remember that's not true Amen in the spiritual faith is substance faith is a substructure faith is a foundation Faith actually exists praise be to God and by it the elders obtained a good report it was this faith that the elders were this Foundation that they were on it was this faith that held them and undergirded them for byeth the elders obtained a good report this word report means witness or record or testimony so what gave our what gave him a good record or a good testimony a good witness amen it was their faith amen that's what we look at and that's what Hebrews 11 is all about so we'll get into that in a minute but I want to background that with a few quotes said how how would you ever know you touched him if there wasn't something that came back and told you see faith is not something it's not a myth faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence that Something's Happened of Things Not Seen it's not just to make believe you say oh oh yes Hallelujah I got it that's been too much in Pentecostal people to begin with you're rejoicing about something that you don't have faith is absolutely a substance it's not a hope hope isn't faith is the substance of things hoped for but when Faith takes it it becomes the substance that you hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen so he goes on to say there's only one thing you have to do is to appropriate that faith and that faith is something that you know not something you plunder around plunder at and guess at you know it something happens now Through the Ages people has rested upon this amen when he's when he's when he's going into this kind of Faith this isn't the kind of Faith where we're probing at something or trying amen there's a human faith and brother Branham didn't even call human Faith bad he said there's human Faith he said that's good it's like an acorn like a seed plant it until it becomes the perfect Faith the real thing so not even your human faith is bad but you can't rely on human Faith it's got to go to the next stage amen it's got to come to perfect Faith to actual faith not to a probing not to a hoping not to a considering but it's got to come to that actual reality of faith praise God and that Through the Ages is what people has rested on something that was real something God actually told them something that was that was real that was a substance that they could base their life on that that would would come to pass he says anything is by faith faith is not something that you work up Faith is something that you have I love that faith is not something that you work up Faith in it faith is something that you have amen it's not something that we're trying to to press into it's not something that we're trying to make happen faith is actually something you have if you can turn with me to the Book of Romans we're going to turn to the scripture and come right back to Hebrews uh let's go to the Book of Romans chapter 12. Romans chapter 12 verse 3. for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith amen where did your faith come from God has dealt that Measure of Faith to you that's your faith not the intellectual side but the measure that he's measured out to you in portion to you that's the faith of God that's been measured to you and so we shouldn't think of ourselves more highly than we ought to or be puffed up about anything amen because God dealt to us this Measure of Faith it's not something I worked into I climbed the ladder and attained I went and grabbed no God in His Grace has given a measure of his own faith unto me praise God and so let's go back to Hebrews chapter 11. because like I said that's where we're going to spend the majority of our time this evening Lord willing and let's keep looking at this Ephesians 2 8 says for by Grace you are saved through faith and not not of yourselves it is the gift of God he goes on to say you can only have faith as God gives you faith faith is a gift of God ever how religious you may be yet it must you must have faith and your faith can only rest if you're a Christian upon the proven word of God amen so now we know that we ought not to be puffed up we're not to think more highly of ourselves than we ought to because God has dealt to every every believer a Measure of Faith amen and that faith is in you praise God it's in your soul and so what we need amen is we need the way for the word to Quicken that Faith inside and bring that Faith to the Forefront and bring that faith into action amen so it's not something we need to pretend or we need to put on it's not something we need I mean sometimes I think sometimes I know I have in the past I won't say anything about anybody else but I in the past I have tried I've had tried to have faith by having a a speech that that emulates faith I've tried to talk my way into a bluff my way into it act like I had a faith and in my heart there's questions all the time and there's nothing wrong with having a positive confession but I'm not talking about just having a positive confession amen I'm talking about so many times I would try to speak more bold and and and the less confidence I had the more bold I would be and the louder I would get and the more but I was only covering for a lack of something else but the reality is amen God comes by his grace and by Revelation he opens the word to us and he draws out of us the measure of faith that he's put inside of us and that faith is a reality amen and you can't talk your way into it Bluff your way into it amen you just you just have faith and you believe your way into it praise be the gone when you go and you look through Hebrews 11 and not just in Hebrews 11 but you look through the Old Testament and you look through the Saints and you look through how God dealt with them amen it wasn't bluffing never worked amen putting on never worked amen this was a reality in their lives this was something and there wasn't something they just went and found one day it was God who came to them and God would open the word and God would give his plan and God would tell them who they are and God would give instructions and they would have a capacity within them to receive it from God and believe it amen where did that come from it was a measure of God given to them and it was real and it was tangible and it moved them and kept them through all kinds of dangers and all kinds of circumstances and that Faith was a reality that held them in the face of everything else but it wasn't something they talked into amen it wasn't something they worked up it wasn't something that they all got together and now you can't produce it that way praise God he goes on to say listen I'm going to say something look faith is unconscious I love this quote faith is unconscious you believe it I've learned that in years of travel around the world and meeting the peoples of all different walks but faith is unconscious you got faith and don't even know it that's right you say if I have faith I should know it because it's a knowing amen there's something in you amen that God has measured to you that sometimes until the hour of need you haven't even fully explored it and faith is unconscious you got it you don't even know it so many times we're we're asking for something and looking for something that's already inside the faith to believe is already with us amen we just need God to help us Purge and the word to purge all the doubts and unbelief out of the way so the channel can be open for Faith to express itself he says here it is here it's you using it he's in the prayer line now he's in discernment and he's beginning to talk about the gift that's within him but he's talking about the congregation now it's you using it it's not me it just flows through because it's just a gift to relax yourself take it out of the human gear that God can gear himself with it and say things now your own faith you don't realize that you're doing that yourself your own Faith is doing that and brother bear said and now the discernment's coming and things are happening and he's saying it's your own and you don't even realize it's your faith doing that it wasn't the faith of the man and the platform the man and the platform was relaxing himself so that God could come down and gear himself into the gift and it was the actual faith of the people that was pulling discernment out brother Ben says in 1964 on the message calling Jesus on the scene he says and you believe that God can tell me who you are would it make you believe you're Mrs Martin if that's right raise your hand see you just have faith don't doubt have faith now what did she touch I want to ask the audience what did she touch there is a woman with her there is a woman with her right hand up in mine too before God see she touched something just a simple little woman it actually to tell you the truth now you see if this is the truth it surprised her she didn't know she had that much faith faith is not something you manufacture it's something you have she was surprised even right now the woman feels different than what she did a few minutes ago she knows something has happened to her brother bam said now it wasn't it wasn't the prophet of God that brought that discernment on the scene it was the faith of that woman sitting there crying out to God Amen that that brought the discernment and she was surprised herself she didn't know she had that much faith remember that it's not something you manufacture is something you have she had it she didn't know it she was crying out to God and her faith moved God through a gift to speak back to her and she didn't realize it was her faith doing that praise be to God thank God for that this is what he says in super sign now then you sat there and you claimed to be a Christian with faith then your own faith goes to the throne of God and touches the high priest and he turns back through a gift and answers right back to show that he's the same God that was that's in me and in you he's the same God oh my goodness I don't want to leave that back in discernment 60 years ago I want to bring that right here today this evening amen because now you sit here in your own faith your faith goes through the Throne of God touches the high priest he turns back through a gift in the pulpit and answers right back how many times do we see him do that amen I've sat in my seat right down here and saw a man in the Pulpit repeat back conversations that I've had what is that amen that's not the faith of the man preaching the man preaching has a gift amen it's the faith of the people pulling it down sometimes we didn't even realize amen has it ever surprised you has it ever surprised you to hear from the pulpit your private conversation with your wife or with a friend or something you talked about the night before or a question you asked God has that ever surprised you hey well here's the surprise that wasn't the man in the pool but that was you doing that that was the faith inside of you not a make-believe not a put on are you surprised that you have that much faith what a pleasant surprise the fine that is that's the faith amen that touches the Throne of God pulls God back down through a gift to speak back amen what we have need of my what is that that's God's faith that's the measure of faith that he's given to each one of us amen we're exercising that faith and sometimes we don't even realize how powerful it is and all sudden something happens in the service and it almost takes our breath away and it leaves us astonished and where did that come from oh God is amazing God isn't amazing he's an amazing God that can measure to you a measure of faith that will operate the gift that way amen thank God for the reality of faith and and what's surprising sometimes is is it's not it's surprising because it's so unconscious it wasn't sometimes it's not even that you're asking God to speak through the minister you're just you just have a question in your heart you have a need you had a conversation and you didn't even end the conversation with let's see what he says tomorrow no you just had a conversation but you're a child of Faith you're a child of God and it's moving in The Invisible Realms with God and it's bringing back answers and his meeting needs in his what is that that's that's you doing that that's me doing that when I'm in my seat and so that's faith and so faith is operating all the time amen and it takes us by surprise because we didn't go try to have faith and go try to make Faith operate Faith was just operating it's what he means by its unconscious it's there it's within us it's regulating Our Lives it's moving us it's changing the way we think all the time praise God we go back to Hebrews 11 verse 4 says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying as a guest and by it he being dead yet speaketh how did Abel offer more excellent Sacrifice by faith we know we've been through this a lot but I just want to lay this in in this teaching he says enable rolled him up a rock and made him a church or worship place but when Abel come he by faith faith isn't something that's imaginary thing I want you to get it faith is a direct revelation Abel wasn't imagining anything he wasn't just trying things out amen it struck him what was needed amen and when it struck him it moved him into action his action was dictated by what he believed amen and what he believed was by revelation see if you can only accept Christ as your savior by intellectual you haven't got it yet you cannot say that Jesus is a Christ until the Holy Spirit has revealed it to you see intellectual Faith or if I could only get that one point right now to go down home in every heart I'm thankful for this place position right now see oh if you can only see this you'll see the greatest thing you've seen in years look not because I'm standing here saying it but if you can understand how it is that faith is not something mentally perceived that's how faith can be direct in your life and you're not even aware what's happening it's Faith directing your steps it's Faith guarding your con conversation it's faith it's not something mentally perceived but it is a revelation a revelation of God by faith not intellectual but by his heart it wasn't something able mentally conjured up it wasn't something that he was able to press into it was something amen Faith gave a revelation Revelation is Faith and it unlocked a something in Abel's heart and Abel knew what to do and that Faith moved him into action amen no matter how much Cain wanted it he couldn't have it because Cain didn't have that deposit Cain couldn't push his way into it God gave him away and that way was just to repeat just to emulate just to copy what was done amen he gave him away but he couldn't come by revelation because he didn't have anything to believe with Abel did and it was there it was in him amen he just had to wait for Faith to grab a hold of the answer and then it was real it wasn't a put on it wasn't an effort it wasn't uh him piecing things together and creating a formula two plus two and this and that and I think it's this that wasn't it it was something that unlocked to him and he knew what God wanted and it moved him in the action further than going further down in Hebrews Hebrews 11 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death how was Enoch translated by faith amen by faith Enoch was translated they should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so without faith it is impossible to please God so Enoch had this testimony before he was translated that he pleased God Amen and you you can go and say well what did Enoch do that pleased God Amen it wasn't so much Enoch's actions it was Enoch's faith but Enoch's Faith put him in action Enoch's Works were based on his faith they were a product of what he believed amen it wasn't uh it wasn't a series of works that could get him to the Rapture it wasn't a series of works that could please God the same things today there's not a series of things that we can do to please God Amen there's only one way to please God and that's by faith amen but if I will please him Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments amen why will I keep his Commandments because of the Revelation that's in my heart in the faith amen and by faith my faith moves me into action amen and those works are pleasing to the Lord by faith or I can just copy and try but that's not going to work without faith it is impossible to please God I love this because without faith it is impossible to please him but he's given to every man every Every Man a Measure of Faith amen he's given me the tool that I need to please him because I couldn't get it on myself I couldn't mine it up I couldn't dig it out I I couldn't Discover it how could I get it but he's given to every man a Measure of Faith and without faith it's impossible to please him oh it makes you so thankful at the end of the day it makes you so thankful now I don't want to go to this yet stop all right let's go to take our Bibles to Hebrews we're going to read through it together now we're going to start at verse 7. Hebrews 11 and 7. by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith so by faith Noah was warned of God moved with fear prepared an ark by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob that heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is gone through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who promised it's amazing how all this was done by faith but what kind of Faith this this reality faith Abraham by faith so adjourned in a strange country well how did Abraham know to go to a strange country God came to him and God told him leave this land and go to a land I show you it was gone it wasn't as all like he was all by himself and just sitting there one day and he worked up some faith and by faith he said you know what I think I should leave here no it was something in him that could believe the word of God and when we look at every one of these amen it wasn't that any of these people were super human beings with Supernatural this and that amen they were common ordinary people but they had a Measure of Faith deposited into their soul a capacity to believe the word of God and God he would see to it that each one of them would receive a portion of that word for their day God came to them and gave them the word amen and already in them there was the ability to believe that word amen so they become to us Heroes of the faith amen who's the real hero of the faith God Almighty is the hero of the faith he's the one who's been working on both ends all along he's my hero of the faith because if I have faith it's a gift from him amen if I have the ability to believe and what would I believe in if he hadn't come and gave me the word for the hour what would Noah believe in he has Faith so what does he believe in what does he do amen God has to come and tell him what to do and when God tells him what to do he's given him a Measure of Faith by which he can do it amen making him amen worthy to be in Hebrews chapter 11 and be considered amen one of the fathers of faith oh praise be to God I'm so glad God had a plan before the foundation in the world and he had a mystery in the back part of his mind and I was part of that mystery amen just like Noah was part of that mystery and Enoch was part of that mystery I was part of that mystery one of those attributes and because of that there's something in me to believe with but even with that I need the counterpart which is his word I need his word and I need the faith to believe the word God is the hero of the faith oh we can say oh we're the Bride of the end time we're exalted to a position there's no pressure like this pressure is no age like this age there's no there's nobody who's overcome like we have to overcome don't think more highly of yourself than you ought to for God has given you the measure of Faith to overcome Satan's eaten in this day God has given you and I a Measure of Faith and on top of that he's given us the word to overcome by so now we're not wandering in darkness wondering what do we do how would Noah save his household on that day he had nothing to save him by he had no idea he couldn't exercise his faith and tell the revelation of the word came and then he could exercise his faith what was Abraham going to do amen being down with idol worshipers being stuck in the land of the Chaldeans what was he going to do it was God who told him to come out and we realized he didn't even do a marvelous job at that he took his dad along and then he took a lot along and he didn't do the separate amen but it was God who was rich in Mercy who kept leading him along the way amen he kept giving him more instruction and more instruction and when Abraham didn't follow the instructions then he changed the circumstances around him to push him in all the way into obedience not because Abraham was superhuman in himself what made him superhuman was the deposit of the sea Gene of God says through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive Sarah was unbelieving disbelieving the promise all the way along we went through this a couple weeks ago she was doubting she was misunderstanding she she believed the promise but she didn't believe herself part of the promise she believed that yeah you have a son but now let's take Hagar and let's do it that way because I can't and then when God comes in flesh now he begins to uh give her the promise amen and she laughs disbelieving but oh thank God he's not going to change his plan he's not going to stop what does he do he comes to Sarah and when he comes to Sarah he gives her a revelation that unlocks the faith in her heart and by faith she receives strength to conceive all these Heroes of the faith if it wasn't for God they would be zeros if it wasn't for something that was already in them and the plan God already had they wouldn't be the heroes of the faith same thing for you and I if it wasn't God already had a plan and put something in us we would be nothing and so this Faith Can't Be A worked up religious it's got to be a reality let's keep on going there's a certain thought I'm just wanting to share we're working our way to it verse 12. therefore spring there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and the multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embracing them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth it's this it's this sentence this first part in verse 13 that began to Intrigue me these all died in faith you mean they died in faith I thought Faith would keep me from dying no they died in faith they died you can die in faith because until it comes time for the translation amen all will go by the way of the grave they died in faith say it this way and just stay with me Faith doesn't always deliver sometimes Faith takes you through they died in faith and when they die in faith they'll resurrect in faith let's go to verse 17. by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called counting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead and whence also he received him in a figure by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come by faith Jacob when he was dying bless both the sons of Joseph in worship leaning upon the top of the staff by faith Joseph when he died made mention of The Parting of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the peoples of people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured is seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he had lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians is saying to do were drowned by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall I more say for the time shall fail to for me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson of jephthah of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword but of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that's when I stopped right there all of a sudden inside my heart goes they quenched the Flames stopped the mouths of lions turned to flight the enemies women received their Dead Alive they they overcame and overcame and overcame and saved from a flood and and and walked through the Red Sea and knock down the walls of Jericho all by faith is that right all of these things were done by faith but the rest of this list is also done by faith let's read verse 35 again women receive their dead race to life again how by faith and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance how by faith I thought perfect Faith would deliver me from torture no perfect faith will keep you through the torture you see how this is not Prosperity preaching this is not Pentecostalism this is real real Faith working in real life will Faith deliver you nothing else will will Faith through the impossible nothing else will will and faith move mountains absolutely nothing else will but that same Faith that'll move them out in the same Faith though to put armies to fly the same thing that will brush back the flames in a fire the same thing faith will shut a lion's mouth the same Faith that'll keep You Through Torture not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were Saun asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute and afflicted tormented how did they do this by faith you mean by faith I am afflicted by faith you can be afflicted I was always taught that perfect Faith would keep me from anything bad ever happening to me and I'd be healed and I'd be delivered and ever that's true but sometimes that same faith that they'll deliver you that will deliver you from torture that will deliver you from Affliction that'll deliver you from being destitute amen that same faith that will bring that is the same faith that will carry you through it and it delivers you a different way it delivers you from falling into unbelief it delivers you from falling away it delivers you from doubting God it delivers you from walking away when everything goes wrong amen there's a faith that holds amen and that's a measure that's given by God oh when I read through this all of a sudden something inside of me just begins to Quake amen because it wasn't what we read through the Bible and we see deliverance and miracles but it wasn't all deliverance and miracles amen amen sometimes amen God Amen had to display himself in all kinds of forms and his attribute in all kinds of ways and his children had faith for every obstacle they had faith for every trial and had faith for every occasion they had faith for the deliverance and they had faith when they went through the fire they had faith for both why because they never quit believing they never doubted God they never doubted his promise they never doubted his word they died in faith amen let's keep reading read this again they wandered about sheepskins and ghost skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts how by faith and in mountains and in dens the caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us a day without us should not be made perfect praise God they obtained a good report through faith they obtained a good report although they were afflicted but to God they had a good report man may not have understood their Affliction and their destitute in their sheepskins and and goat skins and living in caves and then to the rocks it looked like they were Outcast it looked like they were not blessed it looked like they were the ones that God wasn't blessing amen but they obtained a good report by faith because Faith would not let them leave the promising word of God for nothing for no circumstance for no situation would they leave the word and I want to ask you what word did they believe when you read through this their stories this story span hundreds and thousands of years when you read through the stories of the Bible amen they didn't all believe the same thing but they all believed the same thing one believed in an ark one believed in a promised son one believed she was the wound that God was going to use one believed God would keep him through the fire one believed what were they all believing they were all believing the word for their day every one of them believes something different but they all believed the same thing and they were all believing present tense truth and that faith that they had gave them a good report not just the good report was not like a report card that you got you got an A for overcoming you got an A for miracles you got an A for he can you get an A for suffering can that be on the card too can we have an a for suffering and not sending with our mouths can I get an A for affliction enduring affliction what about cruel mockings so far that that's not my grade I'm working my way up I'm somewhere in the F trying to get the D range amen Jesus looked at Peter and he says Satan is desire to Sifty like wheat but I've prayed for you that your faith fail not that you don't get sifted you're going to get sifted but I've prayed that your faith fail not you know Peter he lives a miraculous life Peter they go by the gate beautiful and they they pray for the man and he runs he goes running into the temple leaping and jumping and praising God the lame man and then they later they arrest him and they put him in prison and an angel of the Lord comes down and opens all the doors the inner chamber the outer chamber all the way to the street and delivers a miraculously God preserves his life and saves him but at the end of his life the same God who saved him out of prison allows him to go into prison while he waits to be crucified upside down so when was Faith working in Peter when was perfect faith when was God's faith in action was it when the prison doors opened or was it when he went to the cross and was hung upside down because he didn't even want to be crucified he didn't see himself worthy to be crucified in the same fashion as his savior I say both were faith just as much faith for one is the other amen praise God if you if you think of the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul in one city is miraculously delivered and the next city he's beat the next city he escapes somebody comes to his defense the next city he's stoned and left for dead one God comes on the scene and delivers him the next one he's stoned until he's left for dead and you begin to wonder what did Paul look like what kind of scars did he have in his body when you're when you're beaten 39 times across your back I mean that wasn't a wet noodle whipping what kind of scars did he have on his back what did his face look like as the Rocks were bouncing off of his skull because they were trying to kill him with those rocks you see he had Faith to be delivered but he had faith when he wasn't delivered he had Faith to go through the beating he had Faith to go through the stone and he had Faith to offer up his life in Jerusalem if that's what it took is that right what was it it was faith amen sometimes we think that great faith is exercised only in great Miracles sometimes it's a miracle not to lose your faith in the midst of affliction it's a miracle not to fall away when others have suffered half of what you suffered and they've already left the message they've already walked away from the word they've been through half the church troubles you've been through amen they've been through half of the afflictions they've been through half of the rejections half of what you've been through and they've already walked away from truth amen sometimes it's a greater Miracle of Faith to stay when everything goes wrong and still believe when you've been through disaster after disaster but something's still holding that's faith so when we read through Hebrews 11 amen sometimes you know all of us have been serving God we have absolute wonderful testimonies of God's Deliverance God has done so many wonderful things for us amen and we read through the Bible and we read through Hebrews 11 and we start to focus only on those miraculous times of Deliverance but listen the the the hero chapter of faith in Hebrews 11 doesn't end until it begins to talk about those who were not miraculously delivered but they were miraculously kept they were miraculously different delivered from unbelief when I say thank God for faith there's faith for every occasion faith for when I'm high faithful when I'm low faith for when it goes well faithful when it goes wrong there's got to be a Godly faith that arises to every occasion that'll keep us through no matter what happens amen we have to walk through I mean sometimes listen friends sometimes God instantly delivers us from a sickness sometimes you have to walk through first space of time sometimes God instantly delivers us from a work situation sometimes you've got to stay and watch God resolve there sometimes you stay and it doesn't get resolved we need faith for both we need to we need to recognize faith in both and not just I don't want to be in the situation where God by his grace has given me a Measure of Faith and that measure of faith is holding me through dark trials and I'm going through dark trials just hoping that I'll have faith to get out of this trial oh God's already given you Faith to go through the trial God's already given you Faith amen the faith that will take you out it's the faith that's keeping you through amen it's the faith of God it's unconscious it's working it's not letting you go away it's not letting you disbelieve it keeps having you confess the promise when everything's still going wrong you're still saying but his word is true and by his stripes I'm Healed and the symptoms persist but it doesn't matter I still believe amen that's miraculous Faith amen that's Faith Of God working right there while you're Afflicted and while you're destitute and while you're miserable I want to recognize that and thank God for it amen I said thank God I would have never made it this far if it wasn't for you I could have never went through that trough if it wasn't for you I could have never suffered through that rejection if it wasn't for you you gave me Faith it wasn't me it was you amen it was the faith that you gave me praise God is good friends brother Graham says he says he's talking about job now he says job never recognized that it was God as long as the devil can make you believe sometimes that your little trials you grow through is God punishing you it was God trying to show him something job never recognized it until he saw a vision job couldn't even understand what was going on but we understand what was going on because we got a peek behind the scenes and you realize what was this trial God was proving a son God was proved this test the word test means proving many times God was proving a son amen have you ever he's talking to Satan himself saying have you ever considered job there's none like him in all the Earth and he says but you've hedged him around you've protect him he says I'll remove the Hedge you may do this and you may do that God is allowing it job doesn't understand what's going on job has no idea what's going on and he's suffering under many afflictions amen but there's one thing that job can't do job cannot deny God and deny the word through it all and God's proving him job says in Job 1 20 he says then jobber Rose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped and said naked I came came out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord had taken away blessed be the name of the Lord and all this job said not nor charge God foolishly this is when he lost his wealth when he lost his children when he lost all of these things everything in one day is gone amen and this is his response I say that is faith in action in job 23 says behold I go forward but he is not there backward but I cannot job is saying I have no idea where God's at I have no idea what's going on in my life and I don't know why this is happening to me job is in this discourse with his three friends and they're accusing us sinning and he's declaring himself righteous because why he believes the word and he's offered the proper sacrifice amen so now they're having this Discord and he's not understanding and there's even things he says in the Discord that he regrets because later he says I'll speak no more but one thing's for sure he holds on to the word of God for his day he believes that sacrifice is sufficient he believes the word and that his performance of the word he has faith in the word that was given to him that day and that Faith holds him all the way through the trial even through false accusations from false friends and on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him He hided himself in the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold amen why because there's a Measure of Faith what's going to come forth is gold in you and I it's not going to be the me part but it's going to be the god part it shall come forth as God says God has turned his back upon him he was setting out there scraping his boils well everything was gone job couldn't understand it he said I know God's not unjust but why am I I this way and Satan poking everything at him to get him to curse God job didn't know that but yet his faith held out oh praise God that's the kind of Faith he's putting his children the faith that Abraham had the faith that Noah had the faith that Sarah had the faith that the three Hebrew children had the faith that those that were destitute and Afflicted had the faith that those amen who wandered about in deserts and dens and caves of the Rock Amen being destitute Afflicted tormented that Faith you've got by the grace of God and that faith that brought him out that faith that took them through you've got that Faith by God's grace and if it took them through it'll take you through if it brought them out it'll bring you out if it'll work the miraculous amen and deliverance of the work that the miraculous and deliverance in you if it'll work the miraculous in Breaking you through it'll work the miraculous in bringing you through because that faith is a reality no matter what happens I don't understand what's happening I don't understand why we get into situations and we have no no understanding why this is happening why did I lose this and why is this happening and why can't I get over this but I know one thing his grace I belong to him and I believe this message and I'm part of it amen I don't know why everything's wrong I don't know if it's my fault or not my fault sometimes we don't know I don't know if it's something I did wrong or just something that has to happen I don't know if I've got something in my life that needs to be purged I don't know if God's doing this to show somebody else I have no idea what's happening but one thing I know that this message is the truth and I by grace and part of it and no matter how South it goes I can't change that amen and no matter how much anybody else doubts because of my Affliction I can't doubt it myself because it's not here it's here it's something that just know and that faith will keep us through whatever we have to go through praise God even the prophet of God had attention in the nervousness in a seven year cycle of affliction while he was praying for others and believing he also believed just as much as anybody else did that the promise of God was for him he believed that by his stripes he was healed just like anybody else believed it but God was using this for something in his life and until God had finished until he come to the eighth cycle amen God wasn't going to take it away when we come to that last cycle just before he took the prophet off the scene he preaches in the wings of a snow white dove God delivered him from that and when that great Deliverance came when he took him home just a little over a month later why did he go through that I don't know all the reasons why he went through that but he went through it but he believed all the way through it he says sometimes he was so sick he would grip the pulpit to keep from falling over and praying for others delivered delivered delivered I mean no doubt somebody had questions how can you believe and you can't even believe for your own healing how can you pray for others and you're sick can't you remember when he had the amoeba amen and he come back from Africa and he knows that was because he disobeyed God and he had that amoeba it was like to kill him he thought he was going to die amen and he couldn't get better couldn't get better couldn't get better and one day God gave him a vision and it's gone amen what was keeping him through faith what delivered him faith it was all faith I say thank God the same faith that keeps me is the same Faith it's going to deliver me the same faith that keeps me holding on to this word even when things go wrong is the same Faith that'll bring me through and out of every trial that's the reality James says in James 1 2 says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience that we're trying means proving you know if we say we have faith that it's got to be proved job had faith and God let it be proved amen our faith will be proved so we ought not to get too surprised from time to time when our faith is being proved and and James says count it all joy that's where I need to improve my marks on my grade card count on all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing that faith has to be proved it has to be tried but that triangle will bring patience and patience when it's finished will do her perfect work making us entire entire perfect and tire wanting nothing it's all working together for the glory of God I want to look at this story we know the story super super well but I just want to go back through out of brother Ben's life story and and he tells this portion of it in the message here ye him so the hardest hour I ever struck in my life just give you a personal testimony when I went into the room of my dying baby there had been a gospel preacher for about six years I stood there by my baby they wouldn't let me go and didn't want me to go in but I slipped in it was down in the basement in an isolated Ward flies had gone in its little eyes and I shooed the flies out and put a little net like over it I looked at the little thing and said Sharon do you know your daddy and she'd suffer so hard to her little baby blue eyes had crossed my heart was gripped her mother was laying in the morgue the night before I got down on my knees and I said Heavenly Father what have I done to deserve this will you spare my baby oh blessed Lord please do and looked like I can't come a black sheet unfolded like that just shut her off from my view he absolutely refused to hear my prayer I stood up and looked at her like that I knew she was gone Satan come to me and he said will you serve him now why because this is the hour of his affliction this is when he's being tormented afflicted this is he said the hardest trial of his life and in that trial Satan's talking to him it's a sin come to me and he said will you serve him now there's your wife your father's just left your brother was killed up there on the road there's your wife in the morgue oh yes you're a preacher he ought to be kind to you shouldn't he will you serve him that was the most cruelest Temptation I ever had for there was my baby and what had I done nothing as I note of I said reveal it to me God I'll make it right he said that was the cruelest Temptation I ever had amen so many times it's a story but this story was reality to him and when we let our minds just go to that place and let ourselves enter into where he was cannot imagine that pressure that temptation he had saw his brother killed he had held his dad in his arms as his dad took his last breath and died and he saw his wife die all of these things happen in close proximity to one another and he was praying and he said I was praying for God to spare my daddy and he died in his arms listen when you're exercising all the faith that you have God don't let my daddy die don't let my daddy die and you watch him breathe his last breath and you feel him go stiff and cold that's a challenge to Faith when you're standing beside the bed of your baby and you've lost your brother lost your father lost your wife and now your little baby is Afflicted so Afflicted her eyes are crossed amen and all you want is God to deliver and you've seen God work miracles When you pray you've seen wheeled people get out of wheelchairs and you've seen blind eyes open and here's your own little baby laying here and you're asking God your father amen if he'll heal this little baby and he refuses to answer your prayer this is the hour of his affliction this is the hour of his torment and at the time it made no sense to him he said I didn't do anything wrong as far as I knew he was asking God to show him he would make it right he he didn't understand why any of this was happening to him at the time it was all a mystery to him but oh praise God there was a faith that was holding in this hour the man was letting loose we know later he nearly went crazy tried to commit suicide was losing his mind but there was something besides the mind of the man and the emotions of the man that was holding there was a faith that was holding through the torment and through the affliction he says then he goes on to say but every son that cometh the God must be chastened and tried then all of a sudden I was left alone to make my decision God wasn't speaking to him remember God refused to speak to him but Satan was sure speaking God was silent but Satan was talking and I'm sure everything in his emotional realm was agreeing with Satan said then all of a sudden I was left alone to make my decision I put my hand over her little head and said Sherry honey the angels are coming to take you home daddy will pack your little body down yonder and late in the arms of Mama and I will bury you out yonder on the graveyard Hill but some glorious day daddy will see you again I raised my hands to him and I said Lord if you slay me yet will I trust you see this is when Faith came not when God worked the miracle and raised her up not when God changed the situation not when God brought the healing or God changed his Agony and God took him out of Torment no Faith came on the scene in the midst of all that when God wasn't changing those circumstances what was God doing he was doing something inside that prophet said Lord if you slay me yet will I trust you I love you and a great peace comes and settled down over me he had to come to his hour of Affliction his hour of torment and he had to come to his hour of decision whether he would serve God or not and everything was going wrong but but what what gave him the capacity to choose right it was a faith that was down inside that could not leave God and could not leave his word the man was shattered the man was erect but the god inside that man was still holding on brother Ben said Mr Eisler said to me that day going up the road he said Billy in all this trouble did you keep your religion I said no sir it kept me yeah my anchor held that's right I never kept it it kept me I can't keep it there's no way for me to do it but it keeps me yes sir what's kept us faith what faith not our piddly little human Faith but that faith that was measured out to us by God by his grace by his predestination and that faith has held us through it all friends we've been through some things and we're probably going to go through some things listen the prophets died with their eyes dimmed leaning on a staff the curse took its effect oh they set in amen arthritis set in they became crippled they they were Afflicted amen you say but didn't they have faith they had Faith they had faith in their day to keep the word for their day to see the word manifest in their day amen but when it came to the end of the Earthly Journey it wasn't yet time for a translation so the curse was still an effect on their body is it how could Isaac the promised son die blind because he was still a human being but though he was blind that seed of faith never went anywhere though Jacob died leaning on his staff blessing the sons of Joseph though Joseph would die in the land of Egypt amen he was still stuck in Egypt but he gave him Commandments concerning his bones how by faith he said you're coming out of here and take my bones with you that Faith didn't deliver him out of Egypt that day that Faith Delivered him out of Egypt in the appointed time amen we've been through some things we'll probably go through some things we don't know the moment of translation and if we should have another 40 50 years many of us will get afflicted more afflicted weaker but oh may God allow me to die in faith if I have to go by the way of Grace let me die in faith amen because the same faith I die with is the same faith that I'll resurrect with and if I don't if that's not my path then that Faith that's keeping me is the faith that's going to translate me because Enoch by faith was translated either way it's going to be Faith amen whether I whether I go natural or whether I go Supernatural amen I'm going to go by faith by God's grace amen by his grace and his help by the Revelation he's given me I want to go by faith all the way through every day of my life whether it be high or low I want to go by faith and that Faith take its effect in me a Believer can die in faith a Believer can be afflicted in faith tormented destitute in faith but praise God that same Faith that'll bring us through will bring us out by the grace of God and I want to look at one other scripture first John 5 4. for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith what faith do you think that is human Faith No I think that's the faith that's been given to us by a measure given this by God by a measure and that faith will overcome the world in everything that the world throws at us by faith may God bless you let's all stand amen I just wanted to share I thought musicians if you'll please come brother Ben if you'll come I want to share just one more quote I wasn't I didn't know that I was going to share this but I had it in my notes I just want to share because this is something that I want to apply to my life all the way back in 1956 brother bear says when their eyes were open he said worry follow sin did you ever notice what a horrible thing worry is now we think it's natural to worry and it is natural to worry but brother bam said it's a horrible thing and worry follows sin it's a horrible thing to worry there's not one value in it at all I was speaking here some time ago in a group of men at a club in a city and there's not one value if he was going to be killed in the morning I said worry would not help you one bit I seen one man kind of look down and kind of laugh and he said well what would Faith do I said I said sign your pardon that's right worry there's no value in it Faith so just get away from worry and have faith listen when we come into trials and obstacles and difficulties worry is part of the natural man anxiety is part of the outside man amen but there's an inside man that's got to take control of the outside man and say listen nothing's out of kilter nothing is happening outside God's knowledge nothing is happening that's not working together for good so you outside man you listen we're not going to worry right now we're not going to let worry run rampant in our minds we're not going to let it take us in places we don't need to go this is what I want to have in my life I want the faith that's laying there I want to move every obstacle away from the faith and let the faith Express itself and say there's no reason to worry God is still on the throne and I'm still his child and this message is still true and the promises are all true they're all yea and amen do I know what's happening no do I know why it's happening no do I know what the end result will be no but I know one thing all things work together for the good and God knows God knows are we holding on the faith with all I can but I got pretty weak grip but I know one thing that faith is holding on to me whatever God ordained for me and whatever by God grace gave to me that's the thing that's overcoming in every situation and that's the thing that's holding on amen let's bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for your word Lord there's so much instruction in your word for life there's so much Lord in in your word the examples you've given us in the lives of your Saints there's so much you've laid out there Lord that will move away every lie of the enemy when he tries to come and bring us doubt just because we're going through troubles God you've laid in your word What Faith Can Do faith can deliver from everything faith can keep us when nothing else can oh God I pray that you would just Quicken our faith God every obstacle anything that's plugging the channel for the faith inside of us to be expressed I pray you'd remove it now let your word Purge us and let us see with the right kind of eyes every situation we face forgive us Lord for being so carnally minded but help us Lord to fly with Eagle wings above and to see things the way you see them because if we could ever get a glimpse by revelation of what you see all the troubles will vanish and will know that everything's under control God I thank you for what you've done I thank you for this Hebrews chapter 11 and what it means to me Lord God you're the great hero of Hebrews chapter 11. and you're the Great Hero today you're the great hero of Faith working in our lives and we want to yield to you and give you place and give you room we want to die to ourselves into our own thinking well when we ask that you would Lord bring that Faith to the surface and may that Faith Master every situation may become something to reality in our lives it is so unconscious that it's moving the world around us we're not even fully aware because the faith is just taking action may it move freely through US Lord and accomplish what you've left for this hour to be accomplished in and through your bride we're trusting in you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all but I've been in every giving Faith give him faith everything give him Faith oh in the good times praise His name in The Bad Times through the same in everything [Music] give the kingdom everything give him things give him things please please everything give him faith in a good time praise His name in The Bad Times [Music] and earlier today I was I was thinking of the life of Paul you want to talk about a roller coaster ride from Deliverance to affliction from a thorn in the flesh a constant ailment in his body to Supernatural Miracles taking place on every hand God an angel would come to him personally and speak to him about delivering everybody on a ship because of a storm but the angel would never take away the storm but promised to deliver everybody there's a time that he inside a school out ministering the gospel and they're taking and arrested and beaten and they're in prison and they're told by the magic the jailers told by the magistrates keep them fast and so he takes them to the inner prison and he puts their feet in stocks with their feet and stocks after being beaten and rejected amen at midnight they begin to sing praises to the Lord I think through all the ups and downs Paul learned something that everything is under control I says me personally he demonstrated it here at midnight feed and listen I don't know about you but I have never been beaten in prison with my feet in stocks amen I've had little bad things happen like I have a head cold and then somebody said something bad about me and I have a hard time praising the Lord you understand but praise God no matter what's happening God is good and the word is true and I'm a son of God you can be sick as a dog but you're a Son of God and this message is true and God's allowed you to see it part of the program they're gonna have just lost your job and have no idea how you're going to pay the bills but it doesn't change anything I'm still a Son of God and God's on the throne and this message is true oh I I so badly want to improve my scores I want to take these examples I want to take these lessons in the life of the prophet of God in this age and I want to say you know what nothing's out of kilter everything's fine amen I still believe God and I still believe I'm a child of God and how can I be so Afflicted and still know that I'm a Child of God that's a substance faith it's a foundation faith and for that alone we can sing praises in the midst of the trial is because that never left and we got rough the fact that I know I belong to God that never left that faith is worth praising God for amen All Through the Bible it's been up and it's been down it's been wonderful it's been troubles but it's Faith from beginning to end our lives are Miracles and testimonies and afflictions and hardships but it's Faith from beginning to the end it's faith that keeps us all the way to the end of the promise may God bless you as you're dismissed go rejoicing that God's word is true and that this message is true and he's put something in my heart to believe it and believe I'm part of it and that's worth rejoicing about all the time sing this song again brother [Music] give him faith give him [Music] [Laughter] give him things [Music] in everything [Music] is foreign [Music] give him praise him praise everything [Laughter] give him praise oh in the good times oh praise His name in the bad times do the same in everything give the King of Kings all the praise his name and at times with the same in everything give the king of kings oh the try you'll love this world was getting
