========================================

i believe all things are possible oh lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe praise god and god bless you it's so good to be with you this evening and i'm going to have a tape service and i this is this is a time that i always look forward to every year and god has really laid on my heart to go through shalom together and we usually do one tape in the winter and i like it i like it a lot and i'm looking forward to it but let's just go ahead and pray and then we can be seated dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this day we thank you god for your word lord thank you for a message that you've given to us lord god you told your prophet to store up the food to make the tapes lord we're the beneficiaries of that lord and we're coming tonight to hear what you've told him to store up lord and i pray that you'd break it for us fresh tonight lord that it wouldn't be old but lord as we crack it open it would be fresh lord fresh was the eternal word is fresh i prayed you speak to us tonight lord through these things lord draw our attention to the thing you're trying to speak to us equip us lord for this journey anoint us lord to take our place lord anoint our ears to hear lord in our hearts to receive all that you have for us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you can be seated and thank you musicians praise the lord before we get started i just want to go into a couple of announcements i want to remind everybody that the church is going to be open for prayer on friday and this is going to stay the same every friday and saturday until you know we announce otherwise if the lord changes our plans but for now it'd be friday from 1 p.m to 5 p.m and saturday from 5 p.m to 10 p.m so if you'd like to gather together and pray if god moves on your heart you have a desire to do so the doors of the church will be open we're here to pray and we have no agenda we have no plan i just feel in my heart to do it so we're going to do it amen if you feel in your heart to pray come and pray if you can make it it's going to be an open house format we're not going to be speaking there's not going to be anything going on we'll just be playing the pre-service music quietly you come in and pray you can pray in your seat pray at the altar come anytime in that period of time you want to come leave whenever you feel that you're done and we'll just be locking up afterwards at five o'clock on friday and then we're locking the doors at 10 pm on saturday but but i just feel in my heart it's a time of consecration and preparation you you know we don't want to take the pentecostal idea if we can't pray anything into existence we can't force anything to happen by our own efforts our own merits we're not trying to force god's hands we're not trying to create anything all we're trying to do is get ourselves quiet prepared ready consecrated for whatever god wants to do and i believe he wants to do things i believe he's moving and he's wanting to mature us and i believe he's wanting to speak to us and open our eyes and ears and and i want to be consecrated and dedicated unto him i want to consecrate the sanctuary i want to consecrate the gifts i want to consecrate ourselves unto him and so if you feel in your heart to do that we'd appreciate that i also want to remind everybody that we'd like to make 30 minutes prior to the first song quiet time in the sanctuary for prayer and meditation you can pray at the altar you can pray at your seat read your bible but just be conscious of that amen if you can make it and and this this i'd like to share with you i don't want this to be an obligation i'm not saying that to be an obligation i'm not saying it for any kind of pressure amen if it's not in your heart to do it then there's no obligation if you don't feel impressed in your spirit that god wants you here 30 minutes before consecrating yourself praying praying for the gifts praying for the song leader praying for the musicians praying for the freedom of the spirit to move praying for everybody that will come in if you're not anointed to do it then don't come in and do it right because there's no pressure nobody's going to think you're the bad believer we don't want to pressure anybody and do anything but i just want to remind you brother brennan mentioned that to us for a reason there's a reason he said it and i believe there's a great benefit in it but we got to catch it in the right spirit we got to do it for the right reasons everything our attitude our approach matters i mean there's no arm twisting there's not going to be any pushing in it's none of those things friends but this is something that the prophet suggested the prophet said it'd be good to do and i believe it'd be good to do it but we've got to come with the right approach with the right mental attitude with the right desire in our heart and come reverently and because of that just be conscious as you come in don't come in loud don't come in you know be conscious don't rattle bags and papers and plastic bags and paper and all of that don't be distracting in any way just come in because we want to create an atmosphere quiet prayer amen where we can dedicate ourselves to the lord and prepare ourselves on wednesday nights we know it's tough some people come straight from work but if we catch the right attitude if we understand what we're doing is that we're not just marching in and we're not just plopping down and expecting god to speak but we're actually preparing ourselves to hear from god we're preparing ourselves to worship god it's a preparation it's because what we're doing is so important that it deserves some preparation thought so sometimes some of you there's no way you can possibly be here early you just barely make it from work that's understandable but as you're driving and remember you're preparing play a tape instrumental music sing in the car together but just have that attitude of preparation as you come don't just march in don't be busy in your mind don't just bluster through the door and sit down and expect the magic to take place amen we got to prepare ourselves to worship god we've got to prepare ourselves to hear from him so just take that attitude if you can't be here early that's okay but just take the attitude of preparation and come prepared amen god bless you i believe god will honor that i believe with all my heart god will honor that amen i also want to let you know that we've got new books for the book rack like i do every year beginning of the year i got six more so the bottom the book rack out here by the door the top are never changing they're in the order that i'd like for them to be read in i like the whole church to read them in that order on the top six but the bottom six that they rotate but for the next few months they're going to stay stationary because i got six new titles i got shalom which we're going to be going through in the next couple of wednesdays broken cisterns why it had to be shepherds this day this scripture is fulfilled the god of this evil age and satan's eden so i'd like for everybody to read through those in the next couple months if you can i like it when we're all on the same page we're all feasting on the same things so god bless you all right well tonight we're gonna we're gonna listen to shalom i just want to remind you respond to the word just because it's a tape and not a preacher here in the pulpit doesn't mean we have to sit quiet amen if something strikes your heart say amen amen if you feel like waving your hand wave your hand amen just feed on the word like we always feed on the word and respond to the word this message shalom we're going to be reviewing the one listening to the one from january 12 1964. it's the first message brother branham preaches in 1964 and he calls it his new year's message and so we want to know where we're at in time what what he's preaching and why but i'd like for you as brother ben is preaching this this is what i always do and this is one of the reasons i like doing a tape service is because we've always got young people coming up we've got new people coming in and i like to do this as a reminder so we all are are learning how to feed on the word that it's not just playing a tape as background noise or playing a tape to fulfill some sort of quota as playing a tape amen are reading a book we don't read our bible that way we don't go to prayer that way we don't listen to the message that way but this is what god wanted stored up for us for this hour that we live in this is the things that we need to hear to overcome the enemy and the hour that we're alive so don't make it a tape from 1964 amen you take it a tape that was stored up in 1964 to be pulled off the shelf to give us something we need right here today so everything the prophet says bring it home amen everything it says bring it right to us bring it right to us individually right to the day we live in right to our assembly right right to our homes amen because that's why it was stored up it was for us so don't don't let that go some of you have phones that you're following along on or tablets and so you'll be using the table app that's perfectly all fine we'll be having it on the overhead screen as well the words will be scrolling so you can watch it there as you listen we've got the books also if you didn't get a book as a when we start to play you can slip out at the welcome desk there's a bunch of them there and get you a book but if you look at the book the title with shalom i every time i grab a book i look at the title well there's a couple things i do i want to know when he preached it and where it is in the order of services he preached this january 1964 the first message in 1964. we know 1963 was a huge year so many supernatural things happening we know we had uh started off the year with brother branham moving out to arizona and he has the experience of the sword in the hand then he gets caught up into the constellation of angels and he comes back and preaches the seals then he preaches christ is the mystery of god revealed and so in the token and so many other things 1963 was a huge year so now he's coming into the transition on the calendar to another year of 1964 and this is his first message so when i pick up a message and i play it started those are the things i think about i want to know where we are what's happened before where we are now where where is the prophet why is he bringing the message he's bringing in the sequence that he's bringing it in and then i look at the title shalom and i try to hold that title in my mind the whole time i listen to this tape because there's a reason he titles it the way he titles it and this is what he wants to tell us shalom so the message to us is shalom so the next two hours and 20 minutes is going to be about shalom amen so i'm going to give you a couple questions here i like to do this too it keeps us all on the same page so if you've got a pen and paper you like to write it down or write it in the first part of your book i'm going to ask four questions and as we listen to the tape the questions will be answered and then we'll get up at the end and make some comments and go through the questions and make some maybe some additional comments i'm not going to get far into the message we're going to listen to about 44 minutes of it today because there's some things i just want to highlight and share i'm not in a hurry i'm not trying to get this done quickly just as the lord leads i'd like to spend some time with this message over the next couple of wednesdays so the first question what is a rock in scripture so many of you know the answer most of you maybe but but it's good to hear what the brother venom has to say it's really good what is a rock in scripture number one number two what is shalom none of these are difficult number three what is the effect of gross darkness now that's going to be a good one what is the effect of gross darkness so number one was what is a rock in scripture number two what is shalom number three what is the effect of gross darkness and number four how is the invisible god manifested that's another really good one we're going to get into in the beginning of this so number four how is the invisible god manifested all right now i'd like to open our bibles and read two scriptures brother i'm going to read to them but i'd like for us to go through it in our bible first and there's a reason he reads the scriptures he's reading brother brenda's not just reading a scripture just to have a scripture to open with so let's let's meditate on these scriptures as well so this first one is going to be isaiah 60. isaiah chapter 60. we're going to read from verse 1. so let's go through this together isaiah 60 and verse 1. all right we're going to read verse 1 and 2. arise shine for thy light has come oh my goodness i'm so excited already this scripture is a commandment telling you to arise and shine it's not telling the sun to arise and shine it's telling you to arise and shine be really careful that we catch what's being said arise shine this is the message to you arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee you see brother ben's going to preach shalom amen verse 2 for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee so behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness so there's darkness and gross darkness darkness upon all the earth but gross darkness upon the people so then people will be their minds will be darkened their minds will be blinded gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise so who's going to rise the lord shall arise where will he arise upon thee not on the rising over there and arising over there but he's arising upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee so where are you going to point people to it's got to be the living manifested word let's turn over to psalm 62. this is the second scripture passage that brother branham opens with this message psalm 62 it's hard not to preach when you read the scriptures psalm 62 verse 1. we're going to read one to eight truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will you imagine mischief against a man you shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall you be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly sila my soul waiteth thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation in my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us sila praise the lord those are the two scriptures brother brian's going to open with so if you take your book and open up to page one we're going to begin on the fourth line where brother branham says uh good morning friends so brother franco if you want to go ahead and pull that up and start that we'll start right there good morning frank you sit down good to be back on the back side of the desert you know we i believe the last time i was here i titled this place the back side of the desert that's where we usually find the lord or where it was found one time when moses was hurting the sheep at the back side of the desert this fellow here i picked him up in the rearview mirror a while ago coming down i heard the other day he was in the hospital i was praying for him and here he's sitting here well that's good i'm so glad he had a bleeding and so we so glad to see him in this morning sorry to hear about this brother that was with us the last time he has got cancer in the hospital we know that we only have one avenue out of this and that's the avenue of death as we all have got to walk that path whether it be the most righteous the most holy one of us we pack one another over the other one's grave and yet jesus said he that leaveth to me shall never die but what the death is there is not what we call death like when jesus spoke about lazarus he said he sleepeth and they said well we are he does well if he sleeps then jesus said tell him in the language they knew see he's dead he said and for your sake i'm glad it wasn't there but i go waking and that's when he made that wonderful quotation that we have in the scripture he that he earth he that believeth on me has everlasting life shall not come into the judgment but pass from death unto life i am the resurrection in life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die they never die there's no there's really no death to a christian he death means eternal separation and now as when we are die like in the physical body as we are now we are separated from one another but it's really this body is the only thing that identifies us to each other because we are bound in five senses see taste feel smelling here and as long as we can see or feel one another while we have evidence that we're here if you're blind and can and and can't see then you can feel at one another and we are here one another and their earthly senses declare one another but really frankly we have never seen each other did you know that we have never seen one another you hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever it's on the inside so then when we talk to each other we're we're really not talking to the body it's the spirit inside but the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside and therefore when we speak to each other we are quickly can understand right away whether we are christians or not because there's a fellowship in the spirit that we talk from you see that it vibrates to one another that whether we are christians or not therefore we have never seen each other jesus no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him see in other words god was identified the the person of god was identified in the body the lord jesus christ so he was the express image of god or god expressing himself through an image thing through an image man god expressed himself to us and he was god not a third person or second person he was the person god he was god himself uh identifying himself so we could feel him well first timothy 3 16 without controversy that's argument great is the mystery of godliness for god was manifested or made known in the flesh that wonderful god and we could never understand god as he moved through a pillar of fire and so forth as he did but we understood him when he become one of us i think when he become man then he could talk to us and we could feel him handling touching and everything in as the scripture plainly says that we have handled god see with our hands touched him with our hands god is in man and he's identifying himself today in his church in the born-again christian god identifies himself that he remains god and the outside world will only know god as they see god and you and i that's the only way they'll know god is when we are written epistles epistle of the scripture we are read of all man and the life that we live reflects what's on the inside of us a man is identified by the works that he does so our work should be good see always good because we are representing our lord jesus christ what a wonderful thing that is especially when a an old man like me stand here and think of the life that is fading away that's gone in the past and and we're facing a future of an eternity and knowing if this life only is what i had hopes in i would be a most miserable person this morning but knowing that this life has only been a shadow of what we have to to come it's a reflection because it cannot be the perfect thing that god made god doesn't make anything that perishes god is eternal and therefore this life that we now live in is only reflecting what is ahead of us the real one that cannot die the body that cannot perish the life that cannot be taken see and therefore the scriptures is right when it says that we have everlasting life we have eternal life we should never die see because you become when you're born again you become a part of god see you are forever for eternity never to fail you are part of god because you're his son now i might take another name and say my name is some other name i might take my mother's name harvey which would be the closest to me uh in the world my mother was a harvey and then i might take the name of harvey but still the blood would prove that i am abraham see because i'm part of my father and as long as i got blood in me i'll still be part of my father see that's right and when i'm born of the spirit of god i am a part of god that's all i am identified with him and he is my father then my life should reflect him as my life reflects my earthly father and the image that he was in uh they say i look a whole lot like my father so then therefore it's his image reflected in me and your father reflected in you and your parents and so god our father is reflected in us when we're born and and conformed here to his image now i started talking never get to my text so i was going to talk to you about [Music] i have always appreciated a house meeting cottage prayer meeting such as this more than and i guess people could think that i would because the finest meetings the finest times of fellowship is usually in a little cottage prayer meeting like this or i have felt the closest to god is when just a little handful of believers comes together and there we worship now this morning i suppose we sit here at 30 40 30 i guess or something like that counting the children i wouldn't know i'm not very good on on on counting the numbers just to look over a little a group of people cause these other rooms here you see that i don't see the people in them now but when we come together like this i feel that we get a closeness that we don't get when we're out in a great huge congregation we can express ourselves that's why this morning and i thought coming down here that i would speak to the congregation here this morning and to its lovely little pastor so glad to see many of my friends here strickers and all those that i haven't seen for some time and i would speak this morning to you my new year's message that i had planned for speaking next sunday uh afternoon at the phoenix meeting at the auditorium because in here i thought maybe they're making tapes out there of it that i maybe the holy spirit would give me a better thought here amongst just a bunch of believers than perhaps it would be at phoenix amongst uh you know where the belief and unbelief and superstitions and and everything's mixed together and then if the brethren and letting the tapes out it would be um it would be better to do it that way because you have a better tape from here i asked the boys to check the acoustics first and when i come in this morning brother terry told me that the acoustics were fine so that's that's good so now uh let us first before we approach this solemn affair and i know i believe they said some of you are staying for lunch you got to have lunch here on the ground or at the house or something together that's very fine i just sure appreciate uh seeing you all get together i feel that that my message this morning is addressed to the church of the living god see and that which i believe this is a portion of it sitting here this morning and now before we come to the that solemn part let's bow our heads just a moment for prayer [Music] our heavenly father we are so grateful to you that we can even be privileged to address you as our father for a father means that we have been begotten of the great god that created the heavens and earth and we are so happy for this privilege that we can think in our hearts and then that we are sons and daughters of yours and then to see you strictly identify yourself in the midst of us that you are our father changing our thoughts from the things of the world and changing our emoties and objectives and attitudes and every phase of us to love you and to believe you and and know that your promises are true we have a symbol here this morning in this place that we call the back side of the desert or i call it that thinking it reason i say that lord is not to reflect anything upon this little group of people but of anything that would be of a nature of being small but i'm trying to think that it was moses your servant was at the backside of the desert maybe just he and his sheep maybe his wife zepra and uh gershom his son might have been along that i do not know but it was there that they had an experience that changed that profit from a runaway coward to the service of the god who had ordained him for the job on the backside of the desert it was there that that the pillar of fire that was made manifest for the first time in human life that we know of that fire was laying back in a little desert bush and it burnt not but it was a glory of god reflecting itself through that bush that moses the prophet taken off his shoes drawed nigh unto it and was commissioned by god to deliver a nation of god's people may it be so again today lord on the backside of the desert that we now take off as it was our shoes our hats are all and lay it down beneath the cross of christ and say here am i lord send me bless this pastor here our brother isaacson brother we pray that you bless him and his wife and his little ones brother stricker his wife and little ones and all the others that's represented here this morning and we've assembled here in the lord not for some great glory or to be known as leaders or or some an official of something great we are we are just here as humble believers we're here because we love you and we love one another and as we see each other and as we congregate together we find that it seems to be more of god gathers together as each believer assembles himself in us one certain place jesus said if you'll do this in my name then i'll be in your midst and we know that you're here speak to us lord and if these little note that i got wrote out your scriptures to refer to is off of the path this morning of the thought that you'd have us to think then lord we'll just omit that and do as you tell us to do bless us now for we ask this in jesus christ's name amen now in the reading of the scripture it used to be that i'm before i got so much age on me that i could remember good and in them days on young days i didn't take the long message maybe 30 minutes or something i plowed right into one thought and kept it on my mind but now i reason i hold these long meetings now is because i'm taping and this tape the boys they're taking it will start it at a certain time perhaps now at the beginning of the prayer and it goes many many places around the world so we are now going to speak this morning on my new years what would call my new year's message i tried had three christmas messages and i know you people down here at the back of the desert gets those tapes and on my on my last message up at the church or next to my last message was on the light and uh if you haven't got that tape i'm sure you'll enjoy it i enjoyed it very much the inspiration of it uh the lord gave me now today as we face new years i i want to think of not like the past but i want to look to the future as paul said for getting those things that are in the past i pressed towards the mark of the high calling and as it's expressed like looking back through the mayor of a car we are looking what we have passed when we're looking in the rear view mirror now we're not trying to place a message today as looking through a rear view mirror it would take too long see the things that the lord has did and you're all acquainted with the great uh things that our lord has been doing is some of the mightiest things that i've ever seen in my life he's just just passing in the last few months and but now we are thankful for what has been but now we're looking forward we're looking at where we're headed for and into this 1964. and now if you here like to read or or i'd like to read some scriptures because all this is based upon god's holy word and uh leaves me now about an hour and 15 minutes for this tape lord willing i'll try to get out so you can have your dinner i thank you for telling me that i had till six o'clock tonight that was very nice now let's turn in the bible to two places the books lay close together it's in the old testament i'll take the text or the reading from two places isaiah 62 and psalms 60. in isaiah 62 we will turn to read first and in this we are a minded uh of the great powers of our lord a god and how how great he is and how mighty our god is i am sorry it's isaiah 60 instead of 62 isaiah 60. all right now we read this isaiah 60 1 and 2. arise and shine for the light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee gross darkness upon the people of this of course this is a prophesying of the day that we're now living now let us turn in to psalms i believe that i may be a little confused where i broke my scriptures down here when a in a hurry uh last night in writing them writing out this uh psalms 62 1-8 truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will ye imagine mischief against a man you shall be slain of all of you as a vine wall shall be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from the excess lead they delight in lies they bless their with their mouth but their curse inwardly see like my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectations is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him all the times ye people pour out your hearts before him god is a refuge for us sealant now if you noticed in the scripture reading there in the psalms it kept saying god is my rock you know what a rock represents in the bible a rock in the bible here represents the revelation of god see god is my revelation he is see the revelation of the word is the rock because peter one day when jesus had asked the question who does man say i the son of man am and one of them said you are some of them say you are moses or the elijah jeremiah one of the prophets but that wasn't the question who do you say i am he's peter spoke up these famous words and said the heart to christ the son of the living god he said blessed art thou simon son of jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock see and david speaking here god is our rock god is our rock when god has been revealed to us that becomes a rock see god is our rock now my text for this morning is a odd word shalom shalom in the hebrew means peace and that's what i say to the church this morning shalom that's peace and finnish is called yamalan which means god's peace upon you raha god see god's peace shalom my new year's message is to the church elected in jesus christ for 19 and 64. not uh not just the church groups but the elect the lady the lady of of the church christ bride see that's who i'm addressing we're facing here in our two subjects that we read the two scriptures rather a very contrast one to the other in isaiah it says rise and shine for the glory of god has come upon you the light is here and then the very next verse he says gross darkness is upon this people and then when we are in a mystery of light and darkness and then my address to the church is shalom peace let's find out what's all about see we are facing this year with both darkness and light we are the world is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in and yet it's standing in again the most blessed light that ever shine in and there is uh the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross darkness upon the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of water and said let there be light and god separated the light from the darkness and i believe that we are now living in that hour again that when god is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest and we are then the church the reason i'd say shalom to them is because that it's god's peace that's what i want to bring to you this morning for the new years uh not looking back but we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there is something great laying ahead of us were the years has been the joy that we've looked forward to the pressing coming of the great light and now we can see it breaking over the horizontal horizontal rim but breaking between marvel and immortality we see it breaking between uh heavens and earth from an earth-bound sickness and troubled world into a bright shining day of an immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal earth that should never pass away it's it's shalom until the unto the church now it's like time coming for the believers but a gross darkness for the people i uh the other day uh we was talking a wife and i and uh we were talking about the the hour that we're living in uh the reason i chose this place i felt like i could just let out and talk to you see anything it's um there seems to be a time that's upon the people that it's the most pathetic time that i could think about i have constantly done my very best to try to in disagreeing with man in religious terms but if i couldn't take his hand afterwards no matter how sharp the thing might be and take hold his hands and say this is in the light of a better understanding between us and still love the person not just say it from a list but from my heart then i'm no no subject at all to go out there and to try to talk to people because see we must do that we must love the person and going amongst the people in all kinds of classes and different cults and clans and religions and so forth and trying to lay the bible down and say let's let's discuss it not from your creed or from your book of ethics but from the bible and then not maybe sometime man get up real sharp but if i got one thought that i uh didn't like that person then then the i know one thing the spirit of christ has departed from me if i if i can feel that i don't like that person there's something wrong with me because the spirit of christ when they uh the and at crucifying him and uh his own people driving the nails and and his very creations he created was putting the nails that he created back into his human flesh and yet with a heart full of love he cried father forgive them they don't know what they're doing you see and i i've come to that spot i believe that people don't know what they're doing it comes to the time to where uh the human being has looked like become such a subject of evil uh until it's a pathetic thing it seems like there there's a shadow of darkness just over the people that presses him like for instance this one thing crossing the nation around and speaking in the lord god identifying and vindicating his word and showing that's exactly and never let nothing be said unless it comes to pass exactly what he said speaking it right into existence and so forth as he's been doing and people sit and look at that and continue right on in their same condition see um uh not any disregarding but i like our sisters many times with i speak to them about wearing those clothes and cutting their hair in little things and man how they'll continue on into their creeds and and serve under those creeds and things and and they're good people they're fine people but yet it seems like that they they can't understand look like they can't get it why i'll go back the next year and instead of being any better it's worse it continues on here's a sister once had lovely long hair she cut it off here's a man that once looked like he took his stand and went out for the thing was right he's right back in the like a dog to its vomit and a hog to its wallers and goes right back out and it it seems like there's something that has struck our people that struck the world that they don't seem to have the the understanding or something's wrong uh just like you notice man today you don't find that genuineness in man you don't find it in women now i'm not talking about i reason i'm basing this is get the shalom see but you notice the women in our day they don't seem to have that lady like uh they once had they're it looks like they want to but there's something won't let them do it it seems like there's a heaviness that you tell a lady that she should not do such and such a thing and the lady looks upon that and believes that she wants to believe that but there's something that presses her the other way poor thing i i feel sorry for her she's so caught in such a web of hollywood and the advertisements and television radio newspaper on the street in the store windows with modern dress and so forth and the way that other women need her and it seems to be that there is something that they just can't pull away from our young people our old people our middle age there seems to be something among man uh man don't seem to be have that uh masculine touch that he used to have women don't have that feminist touch she used to have you take man today man don't seem to be burly like they used to be it's all some sort of they want to wear uh suede shoes with purple and and uh they want to uh act like women amen now that is true it seems to be more or less like a perversion woman wants to cut off her hair and act like a man and a man wants to act like a woman see and yet you can talk to them and they're nice people to talk to nice people friendly sociable people what's caused this it's that gross darkness upon the people it's something that expressed them into it [Music] like the jews was in the days that jesus came to the earth isaiah had prophesied of it and said there would be they would have eyes but couldn't see and ears and couldn't hear and that's the reason jesus prayed their forgiveness because it had to be that way to fulfill the scripture and it's returned again to us the bible has spoken this day that we live and said these things have come gross darkness upon the people and we see it that there's something that just simply the people want to but they can't nicodemus expressed it one time before the lord rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god or no man could do the things that you do if god wasn't with him but it was that darkness or blindness upon the jewish race that the messiah might come to take from the gentiles abroad they had to reject him and that's the gross darkness that's upon the churches and things today to fail to see the light that shines see there seems to be such a heavy press we take the some of the noted evangelists today they are constantly screaming for a revival and working right against it amen not understanding without understanding and i don't say that in the the motive of trying to say now uh we've seen this and glory to god they're not in it i'm not trying to just say that in the uh to get people to think well brother branham you you got the only truth there is in the world no that is wrong see i'm only saying it in the light of the hour that we're walking in and for the benefit of people who are trying to seek this life truly jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him no man will never see it it's that predestinated seed and that only is going to receive it but we come to that place again the bible said that you're the light of the world the prophet said gross darkness upon the people upon the people of the world at this time and that's exactly what we've got gross darkness upon the people god in his great mercy as i have always preached and tried to stand for that he always shows is his events from heaven as great major events happens in heaven before it happens on earth he reflects himself in other words before messiah uh came into a place where his ministry would start there came forth a star out of heaven that guided the man uh to the the the place where he was the wise man as you heard in my last message how did god dealt with the wise man and then in the day that he he turned him aside by a dream and he told joseph by a dream how to take care of the welfare of his own son because he had the dream there was a dream is secondarily something off to one side because people can have dreams that's not right but there was no prophet in the land in that day there was no prophet therefore god had to use what he had to use with and it teaches us that god can use every faculty and everything that we do if it's consecrated to him but it first must be consecrated to him let your your meditations which really reflects your dream because it's your subconscious if you watch a dream you'll see that something you've been thinking of or something like that usually you see and let your mind be on god then see it so it reflects something for him and whatever you are let it reflect him now in the heavens above did you notice i'm looking on this of the um the light on the picture there out of the life magazine that uh the brother lives here in his home has uh uh put on his wall uh that triangle of light i just have to run across my mind if any of you has the lumza bible translation if you'll notice over the cover of it is a triune trinitarian light a three-cornered light like a halo and um when dr lomza a friend my personal friend was translating the bible that is the old hebrew symbol of god in the true trinitarian way that he is not three gods but three manifestations of the same god father son and holy spirit the light is one complete circle of light in a triangle shape which means that god will dwell in three offices the fatherhood sonship and holy ghost dispensation all the same god but did you notice before the seven seals was revealed before the great mysterious light showed forth in the heavens uh up here at above tucson flagstaff where we were brother fred two of the man that was the two man was with me that morning on that we've been told months and months ahead of time what happened both brother fred uh sophman and brother gene norman sitting here this morning when it was there when the blast went off and not knowing these things would take place and he sent me back said that the time was at hand for these seven seals which held the seven mysteries of the entire bible was sealed in with these seven seals and how these angels down along the road of messengers and the church ages opened to a certain part of that but in the seventh hour the seventh messenger that all these mysteries should be finished the seventh earthly messenger see this angel that he speaks of then was on earth uh angel means messenger and then after that he saw another angel coming down not the earthly angel that had been given the message here but the uh another mighty angel came from heaven with a rainbow over him and set his foot on the land and see and swore by him that lives forever and ever time shall be no more [Music] but before he broke forth on those seven seals to reveal him that he sowed miraculously he showed it first in the heavens [Applause] that day they took pictures all across southern united states and mexico there it hangs down the life magazine still a mystery to them but he declares it in the heavens before he does it on earth he always does that he shows his signs in the heavens first and even in the zodiac i'm not going back to teach zodiac but i'm just showing you the heavens declare it in the zodiac we find out in the constellations of the stars that he declared the whole bible in the constellation of the zodiac we find out there that he starts off the ver very first figure in the zodiac is the virgin and the last figure in the zodiac is leo the line showing that jesus would come first to the earth by a virgin you'll come the second time as a lion of the tribe of judah he goes through the cross fishes just before that cancer age what we're living in now all the heavens declaring him the bible says now a few months ago i preached for a series of meetings at the tabernacle on the seven church ages you perhaps all have heard them and when i finished drawing out on the blackboard the seven church ages how the light come in and how the light went out and i guess you have that perhaps here somewhere but it's among us anyhow we know the strange thing on the last day when the last church age was drawn out this great pillar of fire which is among us came down among hundreds of people and tuck itself back to the back wall of the tabernacle and there before these hundreds dropped those church ages darkening and lightning just exactly the way i had to draw it on the board mysteriously now the other day we've had in the event of the history of the church sound in the the bible the moon represents the church and the sun represents christ or we find that in revelations the 12th chapter the woman which was the church she was found with the moon under her feet and the sun at her head 12 stars in her crown which the the old orthodox jewish law was under her feet she crossed over that into the light of the sun twelve stars were the twelve apostles that brought the messages to us now under the holy spirit now we find that the moon in the heavens is to reflect the light of the sun in the absence of the sun it gives us it gives us light to get around but it's still no matter how much it reflects it's still not the perfect light because it is reflecting amen and the sun shines against the moon and the moon reflects its light in the absence of the sun but when the sun comes up then the moon is not needed no more amen and today the church is reflecting the light of the absent son of god the church is a reflection of the light because he said a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for i will be with you even in you to the end of the age the works that i do relights that he made manifest and there's no light except through the word of god there was that sun is the word of god in the beginning god said let there be light and when the manifested word of god when the word of god was manifested there was life first god spoke it what if it didn't manifest then it wasn't light yet but when he spoke it and then it was manifested vindicated his word was a vindicated light come into existence that's the only way it can be done now it's when the word is vindicated god's written word a vindicated then it shows light it's a portion is lip are put out for each age we found in the church ages we find in the old the old testament church ages each time that there come a time for a a certain manifestation of the journey there was a prophet came to the earth and the word came to the prophet and he made that word live and when that word was identified it reflected god and there was the the age there was a light that's way light comes today that's a good start friends amen i didn't want to go further because there's some things i'd like to talk about while we're here so first we'll go through our questions and then there's some other things that we want to talk about all right let's look at our first question what is a rock in scripture this is wonderful because once you once you iron this out when you read the scriptures everything comes alive once you understand what the symbology here means everything comes alive so let's turn to paragraph 32. what is a rock in scripture and let's look at paragraph 32 and we'll we'll just refresh here just above that he reads out of psalm 62 verse one day truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall i shall not be greatly moved you skip down a few verses it says my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times you people pour out your hearts before him god is a refuge for us sila so god is the rock he's the salvation he's the refuge and what is that rock in paragraph 32 now if you notice in the scripture reading here in the psalms it keeps saying god is my rock do you know what a rock represents in the bible a rock in the bible here represents the revelation of god see god is my revelation he is see the revelation of the word is the rock so the revelation of the word what word the revelation of the word for our day the revelation of the word for our day is the rock is our salvation is our refuge is our fortress is our strong tower is everything to us it is our defense it's the thing that defends us it's the thing that protects us it's the thing that saves us it's the thing that keeps us is the revelation of the word in this hour so you can read that scripture and be like oh you know god was so wonderful over there and so wonderful over there no he is my rock he is my foundation he is my shelter he is my refuge he is my strength he is my protector what is he he's the word made manifest today amen let's keep reading verse 33 or paragraph 33 because peter one day when jesus had asked the question who does man say i the son of man am and one of them said there's some of them saying you're moses or elijah jeremiah one of the prophets but that wasn't the question who do you say i am oh that's the same question today what is this message christ the rock who do you say i am he peter spoke up these famous words and said thou art the christ the son of the living god he said blessed are thou simon son of jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock see and david speaking here god is our rock god is our rock when god has been revealed to us that becomes a roxy god is our rock he's not our rock just because we say he's a rock when god has revealed to us he becomes our rock and god is revealed in his word what is shalom this is an easy one i think all of us knew it but i like the way brother branham says it in paragraph 38 down here we're right here with the next paragraph down he says now my text for this morning is an odd word shalom shalom in hebrew means peace and that's what i say to the church this morning shalom that's peace and finish it is whatever which means god's peace see god see god's peace shalom so it's not just peace brother brennan puts emphasis on god's peace amen it's not just saying peace to somebody that you can have peace but it's god's peace and that comes by revelation amen what is the effect of gross darkness brother benham actually gives the answer in paragraph 52 but i want to back up to paragraph 47 and i want to read this but as i read this i want us to not think see there was there was times when when brother branham was here and the day that he was here there was no message churches all right you have branham tabernacle you had a couple little groups and there was different churches that that were in you know different persuasions of different thoughts and some followed after his ministry and something didn't and when brother branham is addressing things to the church he's really addressing a situation where there's not message churches but i don't want to leave it back there i'd like to bring it home i'd like to make it you know i don't want to push this out somewhere else but bring these thoughts home and and then let it let your own experience that you've had amen just let your own experience open our understanding what is the effect of gross darkness paragraph 47 i've come to that spot i believe that people don't know what they're doing it comes to the time where the human being look like becomes such a subject to evil until it's a pathetic thing it seems like there's a shadow of darkness just over the people that presses them now brother branham isn't uh he's talking about this press of darkness over people and he says it's pathetic it's pitiful brother man is showing pity he's showing concern he's not he's not yelling at the people he's not screaming that they're such horrible rotten people he's saying it's the condition of darkness around that has brought people into this condition and he's seeing it as a pathetic thing and he's showing uh he is he's being he's thinking pathetically he's thinking uh sincerely he's got empathy for the people because he knows it's the darkness there's the absence of word there's a famine in the land not a food or water but of hearing of the word so he goes 48 like for instance this one thing crossing the nation around speaking and the lord god identifying vindicating his word and showing that it's exactly and never let nothing be said unless it comes to pass exactly what he said speaking it right into existence and so forth as he's been doing and people sit and look at that and continue right on in their same condition see not any disregarding but like our sisters many times when i speak to them about wearing these clothes and cutting their hair little things and man how they'll continue on their creeds and serve under those creeds and things and they're good people they're fine people but yet it seems like they can't understand look like they can't get it brother man's not saying horrible people these are people that he likes fine people nice people friendly people good people but they can't understand look like they can't get it why i go back the next year and instead of being any better it's worse continues on here's a sister that once had lovely long hair she cut it off here's a man that once looked like he took a stand and went out for the thing was right he's right back in like a dog to its vomit and a hog to its wallow see goes right back out in it it seems like there's something that has struck our people it struck the world that they don't seem to have the understanding that there's something wrong just like you notice man today you don't find that genuineness in man you don't find it in women now i'm not talking about reason i'm basing this is to get to shalom see but you notice the women in our day they don't seem to have the lady like they once had they just like they want to but there's something won't let them do it it seems like there's something a heaviness now you tell a lady that she should not be in such a such a thing and the lady looks upon that and believes that she wants to believe that but there's something that presses her the other way see poor thing i feel sorry for her man's not angry at her he's not saying mean things about her he's understanding it's the dark condition of the world that's pressing down and she's a good woman and she wants to do right but it seems like there's something keeping her from it it's a good man but it seems like there's something keeping him see this is a great understanding for us to help us deal with people that's all around us family and friends and people in the church around us amen sometimes there's just a darkness that's such a press that god's got to click that light bulb on or nothing's going to change not people hear it they they they can even sit right among us amen here they want to do right i want to do it but it seems like there's something that just can't grasp it amen said i feel sorry for her she's so caught in such a web of hollywood bring this home don't fish this out somewhere else caught in such a way of hollywood and the advertisements in television radio newspaper on the street and in the store windows with modern dress and so forth and the way that other women meet her it seems to be that there's something that they just can't pull away from our young people our old people are middle age there seems to be something among men man don't seem to have that masculine touch that he used to have women don't have that feminist touch you used to have you take man today men don't seem to be burly like they used to be it's all some sort of they want to wear suede shoes with purple i like when he says that suede shoes with purple and they want to act like women now that is true it seems to be more or less like a perversion a woman wants to cut off her hair and act like a man a man wants to act like a woman and yet you can talk to them and they're nice people to talk to nice people friendly sociable people what's caused this it's that gross darkness upon the people it's something that's pressed them into it that's why we have to stay in the light because if we're not constantly in the light with the revelation of the hour that gross darkness will press on us and no matter how much we want to do right you'll feel a pressure keeping us from the right thing because something has to break that darkness before we can move to the right thing amen we're not we're not looking for a reformation we're looking for a transformation the light has got to strike the seed on the inside and break the gross darkness off because if not that gross darkness is going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing and you find right amongst believers people you love there's a greater separation taking place all the time right i'm not saying anything we're not aware of it seems right amongst people you love dearly right amongst believers there seems to be things are going two different directions and we've got to stay in the light as he is in the light and as he brings revelation we've got to stay in tune we've got to stay in harmony with what he's doing or else they find that darkness creeping back in we want to do right but that darkness is oppressing it seems like they can't do it we've been in that position i've been in that position but thank god he sends the light and he breaks the power of the gross darkness let's look over paragraph 56 and that's the gross darkness that's upon the churches and things today to fail to see the light that's shining see there seems to be such a heavy press we take some of the noted evangelists today they are constantly screaming for a revival and working right against it see not understanding without understanding and brother brennan's not screaming at him horrible people hate those people he loves them and he says it's just i feel sorry it seems like it's a pitiful condition they just can't seem to understand not bad people not bad intentions not people he didn't love some of these were his friends but just can't seem to grasp him amen move to the next question question number four how is the invisible god manifested this is a good one let's go to paragraph five all the way back to paragraph five we're going to read paragraphs five through nine i want to back it up and grab the context of what he's saying because if you grab the context of what he's saying all the way through it becomes so powerful this is shocking what he's getting ready to say are you ready to be shocked now as when we are die like in the physical body as we are now we are separated from one another but it's really this body is the only thing that identifies us to each other because we are bound in five senses see taste feel smell in here and as long as we can see or feel one another we have evidence that we're here are you getting it the evidence that you're here is your body right brother is going to go on to say we have evidence that we're here if you're blind and can't see then you feel one another or hear one another and the earthly senses declare one another but really frankly we have never seen each other did you know that we have never seen one another you hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever's on the inside so then when we talk to each other we're really not talking to the body it's the spirit inside but the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside you ever try to try to have a conversation with a dead man it's the same body it's the same elements but there's no conversation because you're not talking to the body you're talking to the life that's inside the body and if that life leaves the body you can keep talking to the same body but there's now no more conversation because you were never talking to the body the body was only a tent that the person was living in see this is the context brother branham is bringing to us so we understand the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside and therefore when we speak to each other quickly can understand right away whether we're christians or not because there's a fellowship in the spirit that we talk from you see that it vibrates to one another whether we are christians or not therefore we have never seen each other jesus said no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him he goes right from us not seeing each other right to jesus declaring the father no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father declared him see in other words god was identified the person of god was identified in the body the lord jesus christ so he was the expressed image of god or god expressing himself through an image see through an image man god expressed himself to us and he was god not a third person or a second person he was the person god he was god himself identifying himself so we could feel him the body declares the life on the inside we've never talked to one another amen the body's declaring the inside you're talking to the spirit it goes right to jesus it was god on the inside declaring through the body of jesus so you could see so you could touch so you could feel a manifestation or a declaration of god not the second person not the third person but god himself in a man all right so that's how the invisible god is made manifest is in the flesh body of man then brother brenham goes on and says now first timothy 3 16 without controversy that's argument great is the mystery of godliness for god was manifested or made known in the flesh isn't that wonderful god how is god manifest in the flesh and we could never understand god as he moved through a pillar of fire and so forth as he did but we understand him when he become one of us see when he become man then he could talk to us he could feel him handle him touch him and everything and as the scripture plainly says that we have handled god see with our hands touched him with our hands god is in man and he's identified himself today in his church you catch the pattern god is identified in flesh amen he was identified fully in the flesh of jesus christ amen that flesh now has come served its purpose been the sacrifice died and resurrected but god is still the invisible god is still being made manifest upon the earth and he's being made manifest in flesh god is in man and he's identifying himself today in his church and the born-again christian god identifies himself that he remains god and the outside world will only know god as they see god and you and i that's the only way that they'll know god is when we are written epistles epistles of the scripture we are read of all men and the life that we live reflects what's on the inside of us what's on the inside of us it better be the life of god it better be a a a born-again regenerated seed gene of god living out and if it's an attribute of god made alive what is it it's god declaring himself through flesh not one body this time amen not one member not one body but many member bodies still one body but many members upon the earth the invisible god is still manifest in flesh in the flesh of his bride that's how the world will never see god brother brennan said unless they see god and you and i praise be to god that is powerful so when you when you answer that question you back up the context brother brenham's trying to get us to realize that you're not that this is body is only declaring the life on the inside now the question is what life is on the inside and if it's zoe life on the inside then this flesh is here to declare god praise be to god man is identified by the works that he does so our work should be good see always good because we are representing our lord jesus christ praise be to god look at our bibles at first timothy this is the the scripture brother branham references right in the middle of this that we just read first timothy 3 16. first timothy 3 16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world and received up in the glory you realize that preached unto the gentiles part was not jesus's earthly ministry that's still going on now that's through the church ages so it starts in jesus christ and this scripture continues through the church jesus until the combination of the ages and the resurrection of the sleeping saints and the translation of the bodies finishes this verse because he was received up in the glory what was received up in the glory god treat it again without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was god god was god god was manifest in the flesh justifying the spirit scene of angels preached unto the gentiles received up into glory praise be to god you and i are included in that verse in the manifestation of god hallelujah why because god has been dividing himself out as a family attributes of himself portioned out for each age and each time to be expressed to express part of his nature express part of his attributes express part of his plan of redemption amen and god is going to gather himself all back together again and live as a family upon this earth praise be to god so how is the invisible god made manifest right here right here is the invisible god made manifest that's why it matters what we do what we say what we think where we go what we do everything we touch the way we dress ourselves the things we let in our eyes the things we let in our ears it all matters because this is supposed to be the temple the habitation of god the temple of the holy spirit to manifest god himself that's why all of these things matter it's important praise god let's go to paragraph 26. we we answered our questions there and there could be many other places where he answered those again those are just the ones i want to pull from but paragraph 26. now today as we face new year's i want to think of not like the past but i want to look to the future this is amazing we're going to read this paragraph and it's going to absolutely be shockingly amazing because we'll say 1963 was some of the greatest manifestations that's ever been on the face of this earth the cloud i mean what a manifestation what a declaration in heaven and that cloud picture went all over the world the preaching of the seals the all the manifestations 1963 was an outstanding year and brother branham said it's been one of the highest years of his life for visions and things but brother branham did not want to stay in 1963 or look back to 1963 he said i'm looking to the future now [Applause] you realize we shouldn't be stuck there either amen if he was looking to the future for what was coming next we should be looking to the future for what's coming next not stuck somewhere in the prophet's ministry saying this was great amen the prophet himself wouldn't stay there so the highest year for me for visions and stuff amen supernatural light in the sky life magazine talks about that but i'm not this year looking to the past but i'm looking to the future praise be to god friends our best days are coming the greatest manifestations are coming amen the greatest declarations are coming [Applause] praise be to god he goes on to say now i want to think i'm not like the past but i want to look to the future as paul said forgetting those things that they're in the past i pressed towards the marxy of the high calling and as it expressed look like looking back through the mirror of a car we are looking what we have passed when we're looking in the rear view mirror now we're not trying to place the message today as looking through a rear view mirror it would take too long see those things that the lord has did and are you all acquainted with the great things that our lord has been doing is some of the mightiest things that i've ever seen in my life it's just passing in the last few months and but now we are thankful for what has been but we're now we're looking forward we're looking where we're headed for into this 1964. praise be to god the prophet if he can make that transition we should be able to do
