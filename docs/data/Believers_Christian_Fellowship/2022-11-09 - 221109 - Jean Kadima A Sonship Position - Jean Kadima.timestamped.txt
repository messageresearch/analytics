[14:40] pray amen
[14:43] you may take your state for a while
[14:45] thank you musicians
[14:48] wonderful
[14:50] I want to greet you all in the name of
[14:53] the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:55] [Music]
[14:59] I would like to give you an update
[15:03] on the work that I've been doing in
[15:06] Pittsburgh
[15:08] it has been almost one year
[15:13] actually almost exactly one year
[15:18] that have been going to uh to Pittsburgh
[15:21] and
[15:23] work closely with a small group there
[15:27] the Pittsburgh Believers Tabernacle
[15:32] so as we were laboring
[15:37] we came to the realization that there
[15:41] was something missing for the church to
[15:45] actually operate more efficiently
[15:51] um so many things when it to have a
[15:55] church operating there are so many
[15:57] things that are in play
[15:59] so just an example we will go there as a
[16:04] ministers we will
[16:07] um dump things on them
[16:10] and then we will leave
[16:13] and there is nobody to pick up the
[16:17] broken pieces
[16:18] and that's the role of a pastor
[16:23] and we have been operating that way it
[16:27] was not really efficient issues
[16:31] decisions to be made
[16:34] so
[16:36] um the last day we were at the retreat
[16:38] they made the decision to get a pastor
[16:42] and
[16:43] and chose me to fill that position so
[16:47] ah
[16:50] yeah for a while I was just
[16:54] uh I was praying and I was showing the
[16:57] Lord that uh
[16:59] there are so many things
[17:02] that make it difficult for me to do it
[17:05] and I was kind of
[17:07] uh
[17:09] asking him if really it can go away
[17:14] uh
[17:16] but it never worked sometimes I saw
[17:18] signs that showed that maybe it won't
[17:21] happen
[17:22] but at the end turned back and came back
[17:25] to me so
[17:28] uh so I'll be filling that position that
[17:32] role in Pittsburgh
[17:36] actually
[17:38] um
[17:39] I'm already doing that
[17:43] um
[17:44] so this is not a family move
[17:48] um
[17:49] uh
[17:50] when I came here to Pittsburgh it was a
[17:54] family move I just told my family we go
[17:56] to BCF and that was it
[17:59] but this one is I see it as a in a
[18:03] missionary field
[18:04] and I cannot bring my family and say hey
[18:07] let's go missionary field
[18:10] so
[18:11] it's uh just to feel like God asked me
[18:16] to do this work
[18:18] with my human eyes I cannot even
[18:21] understand
[18:23] I cannot understand even the logistics
[18:28] things like that
[18:30] but
[18:32] um since it has used me in a past
[18:36] there is a little pattern there so I I
[18:40] have just to go with that I don't know
[18:43] how long
[18:45] uh what's gonna happen and all that so I
[18:49] I did not even ask
[18:52] my wife Josie to go with me but she went
[18:56] she she always go with me so she's very
[18:59] supportive
[19:01] um
[19:02] yeah even my my children they they come
[19:09] from time to many times with me so I've
[19:13] been supported but they belong here BCF
[19:18] so this is not
[19:19] a a family move
[19:23] um
[19:24] Priscilla will be coming
[19:27] you know I may
[19:29] be using him from time to time for a few
[19:33] works there as the Lord is leading
[19:37] but
[19:38] um
[19:39] yeah
[19:41] this is where we are
[19:46] I have a strange pattern in my life so
[19:49] but that's what God chose to do
[19:55] what
[19:56] [Music]
[19:56] um
[19:58] what has changed actually is
[20:02] in the past I was working alone I was
[20:05] always alone
[20:07] I never had
[20:09] external support
[20:12] not even moral support
[20:16] a really hard sometimes I'm in a remote
[20:19] area
[20:21] where I cannot even reach my local
[20:24] churches like 2 000 miles away and
[20:29] Communications not good and I'm facing
[20:33] issues I don't have anybody to talk to
[20:35] but this time is different
[20:38] look everybody that is is with me now
[20:42] I have have so many friends so many
[20:45] brothers and sisters I'm asking you
[20:47] really really pray for me
[20:50] pray for me and I need your prayers so
[20:55] this time is different I even have a
[20:58] pastor
[21:00] the other day we were talking over the
[21:03] phone I asked him a uh you know a
[21:06] Doctrine or question I said I see this
[21:09] this way what do you think
[21:11] at that time when I started this pattern
[21:14] nobody to ask no one I'm totally alone
[21:20] but this church has been very supportive
[21:23] where the Chad has been very very
[21:26] supportive I kept him updated so I'm not
[21:30] alone it's different
[21:32] so
[21:34] so thank you for that thank you
[21:37] you know even a missionary need a local
[21:43] church
[21:44] do you know that yeah you don't even
[21:47] know how long you're gonna be preaching
[21:50] maybe it's already over I did not know
[21:54] doesn't make sense but it God thinks he
[21:58] did not bother by them say that
[22:00] people will be expecting this event will
[22:03] happen then this then this then there'll
[22:05] be the Rapture and they will be told
[22:08] that you already passed
[22:10] so we know we don't know how bad that
[22:12] things so I'm just going with obedience
[22:16] to what he I felt like he told me to do
[22:20] I need your prayers and
[22:23] yeah please uh visit us in if you are in
[22:27] the area
[22:28] but
[22:30] I love this church
[22:32] I love you guys
[22:34] uh has been a wonderful time a wonderful
[22:38] time a training camp for me
[22:41] do you remember one day I I dreamed that
[22:44] I was in a training
[22:47] and I came to church but Chad was
[22:50] talking about soldiers being trained
[22:52] actually giving the interpretation of my
[22:55] dream on the puppet that's wonderful
[22:58] I've been really blessed a benefit a lot
[23:03] from this ministry
[23:06] benefits a lot
[23:08] I'm a great beneficial of it and I
[23:12] you gave me the Liberty to preach
[23:15] because every time I come I say
[23:18] I will take my Liberty and I'll look at
[23:20] you you say yes go ahead
[23:24] what a better way
[23:26] to be trained so I can take a subject
[23:28] I'm not too sure about
[23:30] but I have the Liberty they told me
[23:32] preach whatever is in your mind oh my
[23:36] that's great training so you have been
[23:39] so good to me and I love you all
[23:43] right really God bless you
[23:46] we we really at the beginning
[23:50] um right now we are in a SM in a
[23:54] old it used to be a former a school
[23:59] so we rent there like by hour by the
[24:04] hour it's not really convenient
[24:06] and we're trying to find a place so it
[24:09] means we are really at the beginning
[24:11] where we have nothing almost it's like
[24:14] when we get the new place we're going to
[24:17] need everything like even chairs to
[24:21] start with so so it's good it's good
[24:24] it's interesting
[24:26] so
[24:28] uh
[24:30] yeah that's all I can say to you I'll be
[24:33] in touch with you uh next week I'll be
[24:36] here there is a special meeting I'll be
[24:38] here so I'll be here so and God made it
[24:42] God has a strange way of doing things uh
[24:46] you know kovit came he was a disaster
[24:50] but kovid made that I can work from home
[24:56] yeah it's like a raise actually working
[24:59] from home
[25:02] yeah but it's good because it's helping
[25:05] me to be more available and then I have
[25:08] a schedule that allows me to to take a
[25:12] day off every other Friday
[25:15] so I'm pretty
[25:17] available and God willing we will still
[25:21] see each other
[25:22] please keep us in prayer
[25:26] God bless you let's just stand and go
[25:29] straight to the word
[25:41] we're going to go to uh I have a little
[25:44] thought
[25:45] tonight
[25:47] um
[25:48] once again I'm taking my Liberty
[25:53] uh
[25:56] Galatians chapter four
[25:58] [Music]
[26:13] Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 6 let's go
[26:17] just a couple verses
[26:20] and
[26:23] and because the ER Sons God had sent
[26:27] forth the spirit of his son into your
[26:30] heart crying Abba Father
[26:32] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[26:36] a son and if a son then it ear a ear of
[26:42] God through Christ
[26:45] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[26:48] of the word let's pray one more once
[26:51] again precious Heavenly Father come down
[26:54] in your power of Resurrection speak to
[26:57] your children we ask this in the name of
[27:01] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[27:04] you can take your seats
[27:15] I want to take a subject tonight
[27:19] of
[27:21] of a sonship position
[27:25] um
[27:26] I realized that as the pastor was
[27:29] preaching the other time I realized that
[27:33] they asked multiple dimensions
[27:35] multi-dimensional
[27:38] there is a multi-dimensional
[27:41] relationship between us and the Lord
[27:45] and one of the relationship he was
[27:49] showing
[27:50] was a relationship of husband and wife
[27:55] bride and bridegroom
[27:58] and this sonship position
[28:03] is a position
[28:06] of air meaning that
[28:11] uh
[28:13] you are a son
[28:15] you are growing into a family
[28:19] and you are called to air to be ear or
[28:24] inherit the family business
[28:28] right
[28:29] so the father has to raise you so that
[28:35] you can take over when is no longer
[28:38] around
[28:41] and this is a different really
[28:43] relationship
[28:45] different from a husband and a wife
[28:52] so and as brother Chad was preaching it
[28:56] was showing that
[28:58] the the wife is not a servant to the
[29:03] husband
[29:05] although she serves him
[29:09] but she's not a servant
[29:13] but she revered him
[29:16] she as Sarah used to call it Sarah used
[29:20] to say my Lord
[29:22] can you imagine when Sarah
[29:25] saw this angel
[29:27] coming the Elohim
[29:30] when he asked her to when Abraham asked
[29:35] her to go make things ready
[29:39] ah
[29:41] Sarah just went not as a servant
[29:44] but as a wife
[29:46] as a sweetheart my husband
[29:50] wanted me to make this dinner she did
[29:54] not say it did not even tell me that he
[29:57] has guests coming
[30:00] you know she just went with joy why was
[30:04] she a servant no she was a wife and she
[30:09] was doing it for her sweetheart
[30:12] and she could go to him and say ah my
[30:16] Lord because that's how she addressed
[30:18] him yeah my Lord the food is ready
[30:22] you and the guests can come to the table
[30:25] my Lord
[30:27] but he was not a servant it was love
[30:31] that brought her to that to reveal her
[30:36] husband
[30:37] now looking at that I say what about the
[30:42] the sonship position
[30:46] this is another position another
[30:49] dimension of our relationship with God
[30:53] how does it work
[30:56] and I cannot really be the one answering
[30:59] that question
[31:01] but I would just say things the way they
[31:04] were coming to me
[31:06] sonship relations
[31:08] a sonship position or sonship relation
[31:15] we see it to understand sonship position
[31:18] as we read it in Galatians we can read
[31:20] it in Hebrews
[31:22] Hebrews 1 1
[31:25] where it says that God who at Sandra
[31:28] times and in diverse manner speak in
[31:31] time passed unto the fathers by the
[31:35] prophet
[31:36] had in this last day spoken unto uh unto
[31:40] us by his son whom he has appointed a of
[31:45] All Things by whom also he made the
[31:49] world
[31:50] so you see the sunship position is a
[31:54] position of inheritance
[31:58] as a son he inherits everything
[32:02] as a wife is sit with the husband but as
[32:08] a son it has to be raised
[32:11] right it has to be
[32:14] trained it has to be brought up to the
[32:18] point where the sun can take care of the
[32:22] business that's how I see sonship as a
[32:27] position where the father is working to
[32:32] bring you to the level where you can
[32:34] take care of the business
[32:40] here is the prophet speaking in here em
[32:44] he said now if that boy was born now
[32:47] listen if that boy was born in the home
[32:50] as a son but he did not become a right
[32:55] boy would not to follow his his father's
[32:59] instruction would not be about his
[33:02] father's business that boy was always a
[33:05] son but he never did had an inheritance
[33:09] did you know that he never got any
[33:12] inheritance it was just Cast Away he was
[33:16] always a son
[33:18] this is a very critical and I know what
[33:21] I just spoke about it when he spoke
[33:23] about the adoption
[33:26] it will always be a son
[33:29] but the person the purpose is for the
[33:32] sun to become mature
[33:34] is the purpose is the Sun to be trained
[33:39] the purpose is the Sun
[33:42] to become responsible
[33:45] and that's the relationship that we have
[33:48] I'm talking about this because sometimes
[33:52] it looks like
[33:53] the sonship relationship seems to be
[33:57] more uh tough
[34:01] it's really tough that you feel like is
[34:05] is it a merit-based no it's not a
[34:10] marriage base it is still sonship
[34:13] meaning you are air so you have a
[34:17] privilege you have a privilege to be the
[34:22] heir of the all the the families
[34:25] business but for that then there is the
[34:31] father has to be strict with you
[34:33] because of the love that he has he has
[34:37] to be strict with you
[34:40] all right why because just
[34:43] is what is the reason the reason is is
[34:48] going to replace me
[34:49] is going to inherit so I have to raise
[34:53] him differently
[34:55] so this is not a wife and husband
[34:58] relationship
[35:00] because we
[35:02] in that relationship we don't raise
[35:07] is that right uh we don't raise our
[35:10] wives I hope nobody dies
[35:13] we don't correct them hopefully nobody
[35:18] dies
[35:19] all right
[35:21] uh
[35:24] we
[35:26] I just want to show you that it's a
[35:28] different relationship
[35:30] amen
[35:33] ah
[35:37] we cannot say I'm educating my wife
[35:41] wow is that right
[35:44] it's a different type of relationship
[35:46] it's a sweetheart relationship
[35:50] but this is a
[35:54] uh Hebrews chapter 5 6 say that as he
[35:58] sayeth also in other place
[36:01] thou art a priest Forever After the
[36:05] order of Melchizedek
[36:08] who in the day of his flesh when he had
[36:12] offered a prayer as a supplication with
[36:15] strong crying and tears unto him that
[36:18] was able to save him from death and was
[36:22] heard in that he feared
[36:26] this is a relationship between the
[36:28] Father and Jesus Christ
[36:33] and we can see here he the bible say
[36:37] that he he offered prayers and
[36:41] supplication with strong crying tears
[36:44] unto him that was able to save to save
[36:47] him from death and was heard in if in
[36:51] that if he what did he fear he fear to
[36:55] be abandoned by the father he fears
[36:59] separation with the father
[37:01] but yet in on verse 8 8 it says though
[37:05] it was a son yet to learn his obedience
[37:09] by the things which he suffered
[37:12] and being made perfect he became the
[37:15] author of Eternal salvation and to all
[37:19] them that obey him
[37:23] I never understood this scripture about
[37:28] the son
[37:29] who has to be made perfect
[37:33] by the suffering that it has to take
[37:38] that the suffering I never understood
[37:42] how can Christ be can be made perfect
[37:48] by the suffering
[37:52] I just don't never it never made a much
[37:57] sense to me but that shows that this the
[38:00] human spirit
[38:02] that the human spirit
[38:05] is the spirit
[38:07] that need to learn obedience
[38:10] I don't understand how Christ could
[38:12] learn obedience
[38:14] because it was God in flesh
[38:17] but I think being 100 percent God and
[38:22] 100 percent a human he somehow has to be
[38:28] to learn obedience
[38:31] and God made sure that to put him in a
[38:34] condition where he learned obedience
[38:39] uh and this one is you learn obedience
[38:43] when it was in Gethsemane and he was
[38:46] crying to the father as he and said I
[38:51] uh
[38:53] he say if it was possible let this cup
[38:57] go away from me but only you will let
[39:03] your will be done
[39:06] he had no place to stay
[39:09] it sometimes he has no food and in gets
[39:13] the money
[39:15] is so the cup of sin coming upon him he
[39:21] knew that touching this cup will mean
[39:25] that he becomes sin it will be separate
[39:29] from the father therefore he cried from
[39:32] to the father
[39:35] please let this cup go away but only by
[39:40] thy will and this is why we can
[39:44] understand
[39:47] by made perfect
[39:51] made perfect through suffering
[39:55] so
[39:58] as you can you can see I'm just trying
[40:01] to show that there is a different
[40:03] relationship between the sonship
[40:07] between sonship position and wife
[40:12] position those are not just
[40:14] terminologies those are not just words
[40:18] but there is a real uh relationship that
[40:24] we have with the Lord that is completely
[40:27] different when we look at it in a
[40:30] different angle the relationship with
[40:33] wife and husband are different from the
[40:36] relationship with a son in the
[40:39] relationship within the sun and the
[40:42] father is not is a different
[40:45] relationship
[40:47] with a husband and wife
[40:50] but I even though I don't know how all
[40:54] this work together but each relationship
[40:59] as a is has a need
[41:03] are you with me it has a need and it has
[41:07] to be applied in the right place
[41:10] okay
[41:14] let's keep going
[41:22] hey we can see here
[41:26] uh let's go to let's just jump in
[41:31] in the message Ministry explained
[41:36] he say this so therefore it was not my
[41:40] righteousness my family goodness it was
[41:44] the grace of God
[41:46] that brought the gift down to the people
[41:48] see and it just happened to be that God
[41:52] chose it for that purpose then as it
[41:55] goes on it's gradually grows greater and
[42:00] greater all the time getting more and
[42:03] more and then in this night two or three
[42:06] people had come and have been praying
[42:10] for and was healed at uh the platform
[42:15] and I looked out and I seen that man I
[42:19] noticed as I look at him I seen he was
[42:22] covered over and coming there his face
[42:26] looked very red
[42:28] and just above him I seen a puppet like
[42:31] this and a man preaching and I looked
[42:35] down again and it was the same man I saw
[42:39] a sir you're a minister said yes sir
[42:43] then I begin to see something unfold
[42:46] just in front of me and I seen him and I
[42:50] say yes you are a minister and about
[42:54] oh let me continue here I say yes you
[42:57] are a minister and about four years ago
[42:59] God told you to do something that you
[43:03] did not do and you failed to do it
[43:06] and since then it's been nothing but
[43:10] trouble and you are just from the
[43:12] hospital now with a bone graft in your
[43:15] leg
[43:16] he begin to to screaming and crying and
[43:20] there God heal him there
[43:25] let me uh with this
[43:28] show you this relationship
[43:32] this man
[43:34] came to the prayer line for butter
[43:37] Branham to pray for him
[43:40] and brother Venom is having a vision you
[43:44] see this man is a preacher
[43:46] he sees his face is red
[43:50] and a vision comes and he say I see you
[43:54] on the puppet you are a minister
[43:56] and he said to him four years ago God
[44:00] told you to do something and you did not
[44:03] do it
[44:04] and from that time on you've been
[44:07] trouble after troubles
[44:10] and the man started crying recognize Ed
[44:15] and start crying and he was healed right
[44:19] there
[44:20] I want to show you that you understand
[44:22] you read the message you read the Bible
[44:24] you understand this is not a
[44:27] relationship between husband and wife
[44:32] and God punished this man just chasing
[44:38] him because four years ago God spoke to
[44:42] him to do something and he decided to do
[44:46] something else and his life went like to
[44:49] hell
[44:50] right and as a father he could not let
[44:55] him go that route
[44:58] as a father raising him for an adoption
[45:03] to give him a responsibility
[45:06] God
[45:08] chastened him by letting the devil come
[45:12] and give him the sickness
[45:16] now our relationship this is not being
[45:20] said so that we can be scared of the
[45:24] Lord to build a relationship of being
[45:28] afraid if I do this is going to do that
[45:31] I don't know how it works but the only
[45:34] way I can understand is is teaching him
[45:39] to be obedient because as a son he is a
[45:45] heir of the throne is the air with God
[45:50] then therefore God is training him so
[45:55] that
[45:56] he learn obedience
[46:00] are you with me
[46:02] and God does not need to do anything
[46:06] it doesn't need to do anything
[46:09] it just needs to remove protection from
[46:13] him and all these demons will come
[46:18] and all this demo will say oh we got an
[46:23] open door let go there
[46:26] and I want to show you that when God
[46:29] does this
[46:31] it is with love
[46:34] it is actually because he loves this
[46:37] person
[46:38] is actually because of the love in his
[46:41] heart that he allowed this to happen
[46:45] Revelation chapter 3 tells us that as
[46:49] many as I love I rebuke and chasten
[46:53] okay so be jealous therefore and repent
[46:57] he say if I love a person
[47:00] I will chasten that person
[47:03] I will punish him
[47:06] so it is a privilege when God spanks us
[47:12] so he's like because he cannot do it
[47:15] with the boy next door
[47:19] is that right if you go a father you go
[47:22] to the boy next door and spank him
[47:25] before you go to jail they will go with
[47:29] you the mental hospital
[47:32] [Music]
[47:33] I only spent mine I chased and only mind
[47:41] okay do you see that the relationship
[47:43] I'm struggling to explain
[47:46] is that it's a relationship of Father
[47:48] and Son and that in that relationship
[47:52] this
[47:53] um
[47:54] depending on what age you are
[47:59] if you are a little bit little spanking
[48:02] is good
[48:03] is that right if you're a little older
[48:06] sometimes it will be a little rebuke
[48:09] raising a little bit The Voice
[48:12] all right it could be uh if you are a
[48:15] little bit older you can just speak to
[48:17] you it is prerogative what is going to
[48:21] do but the purpose is to get you where
[48:24] you want it to be because the the
[48:26] pressure is on the father to raise you
[48:30] right
[48:35] that's what it is it's a very different
[48:37] relationship
[48:39] he has consequences of our actions
[48:42] but it's not to punish us all so we can
[48:46] think that because I do this and then I
[48:49] have a merit no there is nothing it's
[48:51] just a a child born in a family you're
[48:55] just born in a family you do what that
[48:58] family does
[49:01] and at the end you will have a certain
[49:04] responsibility so the pressure is on the
[49:07] father to raise you right
[49:13] amen
[49:17] brother Venom is talking about another
[49:21] case almost the same
[49:23] this is happening in some of this
[49:27] Scandinavian uh
[49:30] places where he went there there was
[49:32] somebody who was translate for him and
[49:37] uh
[49:38] uh and one morning the Holy Spirit woke
[49:43] up brother Branham and say go
[49:45] and go turn right turn left turn like
[49:50] like your program in the car turn right
[49:53] turn left turn and finally it get to a
[49:56] place where he saw these interpreter
[49:59] yesterday
[50:00] and that interpreter had
[50:03] a similar problem that we just read and
[50:06] I just in a split second I seen my
[50:09] interpreter from the night before and I
[50:13] knew something's going to happen because
[50:15] it just kept getting closer and closer I
[50:20] knew what was going to happen it's going
[50:22] to be right away come up to me and shook
[50:26] my hand and there he say brother Branham
[50:28] it's something strange I I say just a
[50:32] moment I begin to tell him and he looked
[50:34] at me and when he did I seen us in a
[50:38] vision standing there when he was
[50:41] translating the night before
[50:44] I say you just come from the hospital
[50:47] haven't you yes he said yes sir I say
[50:52] you have one of your kidney kidneys
[50:56] removed and he says that's right I just
[50:58] met him the day before one thing that uh
[51:01] from the platform that night I say about
[51:04] three or four years ago you were
[51:06] supposed to do something and you did not
[51:09] do it it's not true he said yes that's
[51:12] right say then you had an oppression and
[51:15] since your operations went over into the
[51:18] other kidney that's right he said that's
[51:21] right
[51:24] and I say last night when I was praying
[51:27] in the congregation of prayer did not
[51:29] you take your hand and take hold of my
[51:32] coat like that real easy he started
[51:35] crying he still his hands up in the air
[51:38] say that's right brother Branham and I
[51:40] say God I asked God last night if that
[51:44] was so that he would confirm it and
[51:46] about a half an hour ago he told me get
[51:49] up and go down on the street and in just
[51:52] one second time I would miss him there
[51:57] it was confirmed of his healing how God
[52:00] works in mysterious ways
[52:05] so these things is something we need to
[52:09] talk about from time to time
[52:12] yeah and God does not raise spoiled kids
[52:19] ah God feel the pressure let's use the
[52:24] word pressure like he was a human God
[52:27] filled the pressure to right to raise
[52:30] the children right and sometimes it goes
[52:34] with situations like this then you are a
[52:38] child trained you are chasing so you can
[52:43] understand sometimes when the child is
[52:46] little the only language they will
[52:49] understand is the Lolo spanking
[52:52] that's how it works and then when when
[52:55] they grow up you don't need much of that
[52:59] if you do it there is something wrong
[53:01] okay then but there will be something
[53:05] that will happen for the child to know
[53:08] that the father is not happy with me
[53:12] and they will want to rebuild the
[53:16] relationship with the Father the father
[53:18] is still there is still loving father
[53:21] but the son filled that emptiness and
[53:25] want to reconcile with the father and
[53:28] that's how we work is a different type
[53:30] of relationship but that relationship is
[53:33] there and ASM as a minister I have to
[53:38] share that with you I have some time to
[53:42] show that it exists
[53:45] that God can do something to bring you
[53:49] back in line
[53:51] and it's a part of love is not a
[53:54] legalistic it's love
[53:57] yes
[53:59] yes
[54:00] brother Benham in Africa
[54:04] I don't like to hear that story it's for
[54:09] me I just so heartbroken or something
[54:13] you know he's here uh uh look Africa
[54:18] report trip report I just kept on
[54:21] praying along about three or four
[54:23] o'clock in the morning here he come I
[54:26] say who or maybe seeing a vision who are
[54:30] this a man and what do they mean Lord
[54:33] and he say go on with them but you are
[54:36] going to pay uh for it if you go with
[54:41] them say you can go and if you want to
[54:45] go want to go all right but remember
[54:49] you're going to pay for it you see I put
[54:52] this one in green to show you that the
[54:55] angel is saying you know he said if you
[54:58] go you're gonna pay
[55:00] if you want if you want to go
[55:03] all right why is it saying that seems to
[55:07] me the angel sees brother but I want to
[55:10] God
[55:12] because otherwise I would not understand
[55:14] it's in a foreign country
[55:18] it has no password it has no money
[55:21] he doesn't know things and even his
[55:24] managers have are now together
[55:29] with the other group the denomination
[55:31] that want him to go to Johannesburg but
[55:35] God wants him to go to Durban but his
[55:38] manager together with that group and is
[55:42] alone he tried to tell them even better
[55:45] both work does not understand he said no
[55:49] no he was great in join us it was
[55:52] wonderful let's go this way let's go
[55:54] let's end
[55:57] and the angel is telling him if you want
[56:01] to go with them God
[56:03] this is me this is a gunman taking my
[56:05] Liberty that I look at it I see
[56:08] something underneath the the Angels so
[56:12] that brother Branham wanted to go
[56:15] because
[56:17] uh of a complex that it developed when
[56:21] he was a child
[56:24] it was a complex where he was raised in
[56:29] environment where people didn't uh he
[56:32] didn't have friends people rejected him
[56:35] and therefore when he grew up because
[56:38] what is a complex a traumatic uh event
[56:42] happening in your life then your uh your
[56:46] actions now are irrational and you can
[56:51] see him here if you follow him closely
[56:55] the trouble that he had with God was to
[56:59] because he want to please people
[57:02] it is constantly want to please people
[57:05] the first trouble he had with his
[57:08] mother-in-law was to please
[57:11] and that complex God knew and he could
[57:15] tell him if you want to go if you want
[57:17] to you've got to pay about it
[57:19] and what he did Again release the Demons
[57:22] of amoebia and he attacked the prophet
[57:25] for months and month and month it was
[57:29] sick people thought William Branham is
[57:31] dead because they could not hear from
[57:33] him
[57:34] because God told him you're gonna pay
[57:41] yeah
[57:43] when I read it before it was like it's
[57:46] unfair it was it feels unfair but of
[57:49] course I know that I cannot be the
[57:52] lawyer
[57:53] against God
[57:55] it's all the word is already right
[58:00] we may not understand clearly think but
[58:03] the word is always right
[58:07] the fear of rejection
[58:11] the fear of Abandonment by friends was
[58:15] there the angel could see it go go go go
[58:18] and you're gonna pay about it you're
[58:21] gonna pay why because you are a son
[58:26] a son let me put it this way has a
[58:30] privilege to be chastened
[58:33] the privilege of pig's chested oh my I
[58:38] don't chase and other kids
[58:40] somebody are scared mine I do
[58:47] they are
[58:49] ears of all that I have
[58:53] don't you remember the Prodigal Son
[58:57] his brother who was jealous what did God
[59:00] what did the father told him tell him he
[59:03] said all that I have belongs to you
[59:08] but your brother was lost now he's found
[59:11] right yeah let's just take that part
[59:13] everything that I have belonged to you
[59:16] that's what the sun has everything the
[59:19] father has Belongs to You therefore I am
[59:23] forced to raise you right
[59:30] that's exactly right
[59:34] yeah
[59:35] so
[59:42] complexes I read I listened to brother
[59:46] Brenda many messages
[59:48] he sometimes certainly pray about
[59:51] complexes
[59:53] but I never seen him saying my complexes
[59:56] are gone
[1:00:01] why
[1:00:03] they may just be there the traumatic
[1:00:06] events that happen in your life
[1:00:09] now you're acting that way
[1:00:13] but
[1:00:14] he he learned to recognize them
[1:00:18] and keep them under the blood
[1:00:21] recognize them oh this is my complex
[1:00:25] because complex uh is not a good thing
[1:00:28] but you have to recognize
[1:00:31] because complex
[1:00:33] stops you from being you
[1:00:36] and God can only use you because no one
[1:00:40] else can take your place only you can do
[1:00:43] what you do
[1:00:45] because nobody else can do what you do
[1:00:49] but if you are not you how can God use
[1:00:53] you
[1:00:54] I'm a poet
[1:01:01] when God taught him this
[1:01:06] ah he had a follow-up
[1:01:09] just like when you tell your son
[1:01:11] daughter something you want to follow up
[1:01:15] did he get
[1:01:17] did you understand what I said
[1:01:19] did the lesson got in him
[1:01:22] so the next after he was healed he had
[1:01:27] to go to a
[1:01:30] to another trip and God gave him a
[1:01:33] vision
[1:01:34] ah he had
[1:01:37] that Vision was mixed with a dream he
[1:01:42] had a dream then a vision so he did not
[1:01:45] know did I dream did I see a vision and
[1:01:48] God made sure
[1:01:50] that it does not understand
[1:01:54] the vision because he made sure just
[1:01:58] by mixing it up
[1:02:00] by giving a message that is not that
[1:02:02] clear but is clear but the prophet did
[1:02:05] not understand
[1:02:07] and uh why because he want to test to
[1:02:11] see if the lesson he gave him in South
[1:02:16] Africa
[1:02:18] got to him
[1:02:20] he's a father he's raising him yeah
[1:02:23] that's what he does and then this is the
[1:02:25] in this Faith Africa trip report you can
[1:02:29] you may have read it already before me
[1:02:33] then brother floor came up and uh
[1:02:36] sitting in the room as the Gallant
[1:02:38] pastor of any group of people he
[1:02:42] discussed it when he said brother
[1:02:43] Branham I know that God did this uh I'm
[1:02:47] not disputing your word but a flow you
[1:02:50] say but look here what is uh then
[1:02:54] brother back to say no brother Brennan
[1:02:56] we got to the minister this brother here
[1:02:59] under consideration I say yes that's
[1:03:01] right what is happening here brother
[1:03:04] Abraham realized it should not be in a
[1:03:07] Battle Creek Michigan it should be in a
[1:03:10] different city but because the vision
[1:03:13] was messed up he understood that he has
[1:03:16] to go to Battle Creek when he started
[1:03:18] the minutes ministering he found that it
[1:03:22] was not working
[1:03:24] something was wrong
[1:03:26] in the operation of the gift so he
[1:03:29] decided to go pray and God told him that
[1:03:33] I did not ask you to go to Battle Creek
[1:03:37] Michigan you should go to different city
[1:03:40] so God put him in the same condition as
[1:03:45] in South Africa so now you gotta choose
[1:03:49] where what to do and then is uh
[1:03:53] manager again is telling him to consider
[1:03:58] this the ministers who came and
[1:04:02] supported and all that
[1:04:05] now he has to make this decision like in
[1:04:09] South Africa what is he doing is this
[1:04:13] the father is Raising educated training
[1:04:16] his son for a purpose to be heir of his
[1:04:21] business
[1:04:24] what are you going to do but but the
[1:04:28] back says telling brother Branham you
[1:04:30] gotta consider all this group that came
[1:04:32] to support you
[1:04:37] and brother Branham exactly the The
[1:04:41] Human Side takes over
[1:04:43] yes we need to consider then he hears
[1:04:47] that the wind
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:50] the the angel is in a room
[1:04:53] reminding him
[1:04:56] in South Africa you consider now you
[1:05:00] want to do it again
[1:05:02] you know what's going to happen
[1:05:04] now we don't serve God because he's
[1:05:07] going to punish us
[1:05:09] this is a different relationship
[1:05:13] that's what I'm trying to say is a
[1:05:15] different relationship is a relationship
[1:05:17] of love you want to make sure we're
[1:05:21] gonna get there
[1:05:23] yes
[1:05:28] now I say
[1:05:30] ah say the rest of the cooperating
[1:05:33] ministers 14 churches we got them under
[1:05:37] consideration I say that's right brother
[1:05:40] and just then the Holy Ghost I failed it
[1:05:43] if you believe me to be
[1:05:46] God Almighty he had permit me to to be
[1:05:50] kind of mixed up in that vision for the
[1:05:53] first
[1:05:54] first one those of the first time in my
[1:05:57] life
[1:05:58] uh God's servant you listen to me now uh
[1:06:03] to get me right back on the same
[1:06:07] Pinnacle I was in correct dope whatever
[1:06:11] word uh South Africa he wanted him to be
[1:06:15] in the same situation as in South Africa
[1:06:19] to see if the lesson
[1:06:22] was learned it's a father different
[1:06:26] relationship nothing to do with
[1:06:30] your wife
[1:06:31] it's a different relationship with bride
[1:06:35] and bright groom
[1:06:38] you don't test her then you will punish
[1:06:40] her it doesn't work that way I should
[1:06:43] not even say that but you understand
[1:06:47] right but the sun you can do that
[1:06:50] because you uh
[1:06:52] praise that child
[1:06:54] in admonition of God
[1:06:59] so
[1:07:00] there I was
[1:07:02] the ministerial group
[1:07:05] this all under consideration and even
[1:07:09] the manager speaking towards the
[1:07:12] ministerial group and here I was
[1:07:14] standing here to make my choice to serve
[1:07:18] God to do what God did and do what the
[1:07:21] ministers say do
[1:07:24] that was my place the grace of God came
[1:07:28] down
[1:07:29] because the purpose of God was not to
[1:07:32] say I'm going to beat you if you don't
[1:07:34] do it
[1:07:35] I want you to learn
[1:07:38] he even came to rescue him
[1:07:41] but that presence of the Angel was to
[1:07:44] rescue him I wanted to do right
[1:07:48] you see different relationship churches
[1:07:51] we need to we need all this relationship
[1:07:55] raise the relationship of husband and
[1:07:58] wife but father and son is even there is
[1:08:02] a relationship for brothers is our
[1:08:04] brother do you know that he as a brother
[1:08:07] it goes ahead when he succeed we succeed
[1:08:11] is that right when is resurrected we
[1:08:14] resurrect is it goes ahead when he you
[1:08:19] know is a we he has a leadership
[1:08:23] a position that's another uh
[1:08:27] dimension of the relationship we have
[1:08:30] with God
[1:08:31] we should not ignore that
[1:08:34] yeah
[1:08:44] in the
[1:08:46] message
[1:08:48] this is a this is another message where
[1:08:52] the Branham
[1:08:56] had a family
[1:09:00] that come to church
[1:09:02] from time to time you don't see them in
[1:09:05] church every time they come
[1:09:10] when there is a special meeting
[1:09:13] there we come
[1:09:14] sometimes they don't come
[1:09:17] one to three months they come
[1:09:20] and then something happened
[1:09:23] the daughter is sick it's terribly sick
[1:09:27] she's going to die
[1:09:30] and he is brother when I'm goes and she
[1:09:36] she has a baby and the baby is
[1:09:42] condition is not good and she's the
[1:09:47] situation is like the baby has to come
[1:09:50] out
[1:09:51] uh
[1:09:53] otherwise she's going to die it's a very
[1:09:56] complicated situation I don't remember
[1:09:57] the story very well
[1:10:00] and when he went there and pray that the
[1:10:04] whole family that has been a little in
[1:10:07] and out they say we're going to serve
[1:10:10] the Lord if our daughter is here
[1:10:13] and part of them say great so he pray
[1:10:17] the girl becomes fine and uh they were
[1:10:22] saying no now you're going to be
[1:10:23] operating and everything will be fine
[1:10:26] and you know the story
[1:10:29] that woman at night she's telling her
[1:10:33] mother I'm going home
[1:10:36] and the mother said yeah you're going
[1:10:38] home tomorrow everything will be fine
[1:10:40] say no I'm going to my heavenly father
[1:10:43] home
[1:10:46] so and she passed away
[1:10:49] and when brother Branham heard it it
[1:10:52] could not believe it
[1:10:54] to see how the family was so joyful
[1:10:57] saying that oh this is wonderful if
[1:11:00] she's here we go we're going all to be
[1:11:05] to give a heart to the Lord
[1:11:08] look he takes her like that and and
[1:11:13] brother Branham goes and in this message
[1:11:16] God that's called doesn't call men to
[1:11:18] judgment without first warning him he
[1:11:20] said I don't know that caused me to do
[1:11:23] it but I say Lord God you owe me an
[1:11:28] understanding
[1:11:30] see after me going out there and telling
[1:11:35] that husband and him coming to the Lord
[1:11:38] after you've done
[1:11:42] these things for him and all like that
[1:11:45] and then take that girl's life like that
[1:11:49] I say you owe me an understanding
[1:11:55] so when you have your son grown up like
[1:12:00] that he's saying you know you owe me an
[1:12:03] explanation
[1:12:05] you just say wow who did I raise
[1:12:10] you know
[1:12:12] you know God owes you an explanation but
[1:12:16] this is good that we have that in tapes
[1:12:19] and books
[1:12:22] shared is experience with us and those
[1:12:26] are not things that he's proud of
[1:12:29] but it was gracious enough to share
[1:12:33] death
[1:12:35] so we know so and and what happened is
[1:12:39] when you tell God something like that he
[1:12:42] will leave you sitting alone
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:46] he don't owe you he owe me nothing I am
[1:12:51] in debt to him so what he did he just
[1:12:55] ignored but as a child that has just
[1:12:59] sent you know through it through a
[1:13:02] tantrum you owe me an explanation
[1:13:08] as a kid like that you just look at them
[1:13:12] except if they do it at Walmart
[1:13:20] that was not me that was the pastor
[1:13:22] that's why
[1:13:25] so uh
[1:13:29] uh so you see uh as a father
[1:13:34] I he could not tolerate such a thing
[1:13:38] who am I raising
[1:13:42] as a father you say a grown up
[1:13:47] a personalized experience with you
[1:13:50] saying you owe me an explanation why did
[1:13:53] you let that girl that woman die God
[1:13:57] look at him ignore him
[1:14:00] and sometimes that's why the Earthly
[1:14:03] father dies
[1:14:07] our fathers are limited but you are not
[1:14:11] alone
[1:14:13] and sometimes difficult children like
[1:14:15] that
[1:14:16] they think they are Untitled
[1:14:21] to
[1:14:22] they are Untitled they just feel the
[1:14:24] Untitled and now Heavenly Father could
[1:14:28] not let
[1:14:29] his son to feel like it's Untitled
[1:14:32] what's going to happen to him it's just
[1:14:35] to see the disaster
[1:14:37] yeah
[1:14:39] he feels like that
[1:14:41] it's on me to make sure this boy this
[1:14:45] girl doesn't think the world that owes
[1:14:49] him anything
[1:14:51] everybody has to be nice with me I am
[1:14:54] the center of the universe
[1:14:58] it doesn't work that way
[1:15:02] and if you let him you see what is going
[1:15:05] to be in the future
[1:15:08] and our heavenly father sees that he say
[1:15:11] what is he going to be in the future he
[1:15:14] ignored him for four months don't talk
[1:15:17] to him
[1:15:21] then after four months he gave him a
[1:15:24] vision to show him what happened that
[1:15:26] woman was supposed to die
[1:15:29] because she fall in a creek and her
[1:15:34] dress was Tangled to some rock or
[1:15:37] whatever and she turned blue with the
[1:15:39] Water by her husband found her and she
[1:15:44] it was her time to go but God found that
[1:15:47] that she was not ready to go that's why
[1:15:51] that day God made sure that she won't
[1:15:55] pass away before repenting and giving
[1:15:58] her heart to the Lord
[1:16:00] it did not have to explain to us
[1:16:04] to him you know God does not owe us
[1:16:09] explanation
[1:16:14] there are so many things I don't
[1:16:16] understand at all
[1:16:18] at which way to turn
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:22] he has the prerogative and whatever it
[1:16:25] does at the end it will be for the
[1:16:28] inheritance
[1:16:30] it will be for our good the pressure it
[1:16:35] was in our heavenly father
[1:16:39] to correct him
[1:16:40] because he has to take care of the
[1:16:43] business we will reign with him
[1:16:47] sonship is reign with him
[1:16:52] his inheritance
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:58] are you with me
[1:16:59] amen
[1:17:01] I know I know I know I'm very
[1:17:04] tough tonight
[1:17:07] right that's how he works tonight
[1:17:09] I don't know either way okay now the
[1:17:13] Angel and the commission brother Branham
[1:17:17] you know this story
[1:17:19] um I'm just going to hide it a little
[1:17:23] bit from you
[1:17:26] this story
[1:17:27] is uh brother Branham used to tell
[1:17:30] people
[1:17:32] uh if you have any sickness I'm gonna
[1:17:35] pray for you
[1:17:37] just give me time if I take longer
[1:17:41] enough you're going to be here God will
[1:17:44] answer you just needs to take long
[1:17:46] enough keep praying and he did it for a
[1:17:50] while
[1:17:51] even a paraplegic girl her brother when
[1:17:55] I'm just pray and now a 45 minute and
[1:17:59] the bones were back in place and she
[1:18:03] could walk
[1:18:04] and uh
[1:18:06] but when I'm keep doing that
[1:18:08] but the heavenly father knew that that
[1:18:12] was wrong in that relationship in the
[1:18:17] relationship of sun he has to correct
[1:18:21] him
[1:18:22] he sent the angel to talk to barabena
[1:18:26] and is the angel came and said this in
[1:18:30] the Angel and the commission I felt it
[1:18:32] moving close to me and when it did I
[1:18:35] just heard a voice sound like a way back
[1:18:39] I could not impersonate the voice if I
[1:18:43] had to but I heard it just as plain and
[1:18:46] audible as my voice is to you
[1:18:49] say you are confining too much of that
[1:18:53] gift of healing to perform Miracles it
[1:18:57] will come to pass that people will not
[1:19:00] believe you unless there is a miracle
[1:19:02] performed
[1:19:03] I say I will never I shall never do that
[1:19:08] again so help me God
[1:19:10] and he went out of the room
[1:19:13] but uh more details of this is you can
[1:19:19] see here this Angel did not go right
[1:19:22] away
[1:19:23] the angel comes to brother Birmingham to
[1:19:26] tell him what he's doing is wrong
[1:19:30] is gracious enough to tell us that so he
[1:19:35] can help us in our walk with the Lord
[1:19:40] you're confining you you can just see
[1:19:44] that this is not what a brand name
[1:19:46] vocabulary
[1:19:48] all right another one doesn't talk this
[1:19:51] type of English is is English is close
[1:19:53] to my
[1:19:55] but uh is the end you see that that the
[1:19:59] person who made the language was
[1:20:01] speaking to him
[1:20:03] he's telling him that you are confining
[1:20:07] meaning that you have
[1:20:10] restricted the operation of the gift and
[1:20:15] made it something
[1:20:17] giving is give it a scope that it
[1:20:21] doesn't have right you
[1:20:26] move that uh
[1:20:29] uh that boundaries of of how a healing
[1:20:34] gift Works healing should be a person is
[1:20:38] sick they believe that vertebraham can
[1:20:41] pray for them and they pray for them and
[1:20:45] they are healed but now you have changed
[1:20:48] the way the gift Operate Now is going to
[1:20:52] be before people believe you give them a
[1:20:56] miracle
[1:20:57] you have just changed the usage of the
[1:21:02] gift of healing
[1:21:06] and
[1:21:07] its purpose was not just to rebuke him
[1:21:11] and and be mad at him it was to correct
[1:21:16] his son because his air is coming to
[1:21:20] correct him to train him to make him
[1:21:24] more mature more responsible then
[1:21:27] brother but I'm saying I will not do
[1:21:30] this again help me Lord
[1:21:33] and the angel did not even live
[1:21:36] immediately
[1:21:39] at that point he has given his message
[1:21:42] is not by anger that this the father is
[1:21:47] raising the sun It Is by love so you can
[1:21:51] see the Angels sit back and stay there
[1:21:55] and Brother Bear
[1:21:57] thoughts a thought come to him what if
[1:22:01] my son
[1:22:03] see the angel
[1:22:07] my Lord do you mind if my son can see
[1:22:11] you
[1:22:12] I want to show you that because it was
[1:22:14] not the anger by anger that he came you
[1:22:16] did yes you did this you confining the
[1:22:19] usage of the uh the use of the gift of
[1:22:24] the healing gift that you using it the
[1:22:26] wrong way
[1:22:28] no it was to tell him to correct him
[1:22:32] with love then he sit back
[1:22:37] and it did not turn into light and
[1:22:40] disappear
[1:22:41] is it bad
[1:22:43] and whatever I'm saying can my son see
[1:22:46] you and yeah my son is always a
[1:22:48] concerned when I go traveling he think
[1:22:51] I'm gonna die can he see you
[1:22:54] and the angels say
[1:22:56] the angel just stayed there
[1:22:58] and finally Billy Paul was able to see
[1:23:01] the angel of the Lord
[1:23:04] it was not a rebuke with anger it was
[1:23:08] the manifestation of the love of God
[1:23:12] those that I love I rebuke for what for
[1:23:16] the purpose of training them for the
[1:23:19] duty that I have for them for the
[1:23:21] inheritance that I have for them what a
[1:23:25] privilege being rebuked by our father
[1:23:28] when you come to church and the message
[1:23:31] that day is Staff tough on you remember
[1:23:34] that the love of God manifested to you
[1:23:38] in a sonship in your son's ship position
[1:23:46] and the minister a pastor should not
[1:23:49] feel like this is not good for me to say
[1:23:53] it has to have that Liberty because that
[1:23:56] rebuke is a privilege only to his
[1:24:01] children
[1:24:03] not to anybody else I will not go do it
[1:24:05] for the next the child next door only
[1:24:09] mine
[1:24:12] I rebuke
[1:24:15] for a purpose
[1:24:19] amen
[1:24:23] oh my God time is flying I did not know
[1:24:28] in experience the prophet say that but
[1:24:32] first came
[1:24:34] so here
[1:24:35] I first came for scan we reverent about
[1:24:40] our head everywhere for prayer father
[1:24:43] dear we come to thee today just as
[1:24:47] humbly as we know how to approach thee
[1:24:51] and realizing the last time that I stood
[1:24:54] on this puppet I was condemned man I
[1:24:58] stood here and realized how helpless I
[1:25:01] was without you
[1:25:03] feel your presence leave me and to see
[1:25:06] me come here before a little girl I was
[1:25:09] just merely hard of hearing and see her
[1:25:13] go deaf right here on the pulpit
[1:25:18] this is a story where brother Branham
[1:25:20] after the Holy Spirit told him not to
[1:25:24] confine the healing gift into a
[1:25:29] performing of Miracle he found elupo
[1:25:34] to please people
[1:25:38] a people pleaser
[1:25:40] thank God for sharing that with us again
[1:25:45] he found a way of bypassing the father
[1:25:50] instructions like yeah
[1:25:52] we did it when we were boys and girls
[1:25:56] and yeah father said six o'clock at home
[1:25:59] and I find a loophole and that's what he
[1:26:02] did he said no I'm not going to pray for
[1:26:07] hours for healing miracle for a miracle
[1:26:11] but I will put the people that have a
[1:26:16] visible
[1:26:18] infirmities like blind like you know uh
[1:26:23] handicaps and things like that put them
[1:26:26] in a first line and start praying for
[1:26:29] them first
[1:26:31] and the light of sickness after
[1:26:35] so just a little bit by passing no no no
[1:26:38] I I did not pray for hours for one
[1:26:42] person but this was different he knew in
[1:26:45] his heart that it was the same thing you
[1:26:49] understand what I'm talking about
[1:26:51] it was the same thing it was just making
[1:26:53] taking a detour and God
[1:26:57] saw it and as he was preaching thinking
[1:27:03] about what is going to preach he saw
[1:27:06] himself like Balaam
[1:27:10] where God told him not to do it not to
[1:27:14] go Balaam went
[1:27:16] and God say that
[1:27:20] and and he felt in his heart he fell in
[1:27:24] his heart to say Lord if what I'm doing
[1:27:28] is not right I'm asking you
[1:27:31] I'm asking you
[1:27:33] uh
[1:27:35] the person I'm gonna pray for if they
[1:27:38] are not healed
[1:27:39] then you are not happy with me
[1:27:43] and what Buddha bam did at that time was
[1:27:47] actually to put this scripture on hold
[1:27:54] for the gifts and calling of God are
[1:27:56] without repentance he said to the Lord
[1:27:59] when I pray
[1:28:01] don't answer the prayer
[1:28:04] then I will know what I did was wrong
[1:28:10] but the gift and calling are without
[1:28:13] repentance
[1:28:14] even when somebody is in the wrong the
[1:28:17] gift can work
[1:28:19] but he say to the Lord put it on hold
[1:28:22] for me because I don't want a gift that
[1:28:26] is operating outside of God perfect will
[1:28:31] I want the backing of God in my gifts
[1:28:37] I don't want a gift that operating just
[1:28:40] because gifts and calling are without
[1:28:43] repentance
[1:28:45] I want to be the perfect will I want all
[1:28:48] the kingdom of God to be behind me
[1:28:51] when I'm exercising
[1:28:53] my gift
[1:28:56] that's what he did and that child that
[1:28:59] was hard of hearing became death pretty
[1:29:03] much
[1:29:04] another came same thing
[1:29:07] why because God told him you confining
[1:29:13] the use of the healing gift
[1:29:17] and to give into miracles
[1:29:21] and it will happen that people will look
[1:29:24] for miracle before accepting the healing
[1:29:28] and that's wrong that's not what I say
[1:29:30] and I cannot let that happen to my son
[1:29:34] somebody else can do for their sons and
[1:29:37] daughters not me
[1:29:43] are you with my church
[1:29:46] yes
[1:29:48] and when their eyes were open they knew
[1:29:51] him
[1:29:52] and when God lets things happen like
[1:29:54] that it does it purposely
[1:29:57] just just to test you
[1:29:59] now let me get this before you straight
[1:30:02] so that you will understand that every
[1:30:05] Sun that comes to God has got to be
[1:30:08] child trained
[1:30:10] it's got to be tested every time if you
[1:30:13] never
[1:30:13] you never tested you are not a son
[1:30:18] what I mean a privilege to be tested
[1:30:22] it's not given to everybody
[1:30:25] yeah
[1:30:26] and he said if you can't stand the
[1:30:29] chastisement of God then you are
[1:30:32] allegedly
[1:30:33] legitimate and and now not a child of
[1:30:38] God
[1:30:39] you claim God is your father you say oh
[1:30:42] I can't believe it I can't believe well
[1:30:45] that just shows that God is not your
[1:30:48] father see you would get it and now
[1:30:52] notice this is testing God tests every
[1:30:55] one of his children all that come to him
[1:30:59] must first be tested tried and proved
[1:31:03] to deserve not to deserve you are
[1:31:06] already born in the family
[1:31:09] you are already a son you are a daughter
[1:31:11] no no no it's not for you to deserve but
[1:31:14] to get to the level where he wants you
[1:31:19] where you want to use you
[1:31:24] therefore we as children we
[1:31:29] we would like to
[1:31:31] always be ask God for that obedient part
[1:31:37] of us this is a different relationship
[1:31:42] I hope you understand this
[1:31:44] this is different
[1:31:46] from a sweetheart relationship which we
[1:31:50] are part right as a bride we are part of
[1:31:54] that relationship
[1:31:55] you know it will not punish it will not
[1:31:58] let her bride to go into uh tribulation
[1:32:03] he can't do all the things because
[1:32:05] that's different relationship but the
[1:32:08] son has to suffer
[1:32:10] hex his son has to go through things has
[1:32:14] to go through training has to learn
[1:32:17] obedience he has to learn submission to
[1:32:21] the word of God
[1:32:23] and when God does it for us when you do
[1:32:27] something and you
[1:32:29] feel like you feel like
[1:32:32] my heavenly father is not happy
[1:32:36] you say I feel empty some people say
[1:32:39] that right
[1:32:40] these days I feel empty that's a
[1:32:43] privilege that's the grace of God there
[1:32:45] are people that don't feel anything they
[1:32:48] can walk do anything but they don't feel
[1:32:52] anything but you do you say I've been
[1:32:56] feeling so empty you see that's another
[1:33:00] way the father acts to bring you back to
[1:33:05] him that relationship with him is so
[1:33:08] critical
[1:33:11] do you agree
[1:33:13] amen I'll let the musician come there
[1:33:16] the musician comes
[1:33:19] I was looking at this sonship position
[1:33:26] I was like it looks to me
[1:33:29] like when the Lord speak about the water
[1:33:32] the blood and the spirit
[1:33:37] each one is different
[1:33:42] the water is chemical two gas together
[1:33:46] water
[1:33:47] blood organic has DNA
[1:33:51] totally different
[1:33:54] and spirit is immaterial it doesn't have
[1:33:59] a form a shape
[1:34:03] but they all work together
[1:34:07] they're totally different water blood
[1:34:10] and spirit they're totally different
[1:34:12] they work together
[1:34:14] we have a relationship of uh of Bride
[1:34:18] and bridegroom husband and wife we serve
[1:34:22] him although we are not servant we love
[1:34:25] him we we sweetheart in that type of
[1:34:29] relationship but we as a bride we we are
[1:34:34] submissive to him because he is our head
[1:34:39] that's a different relationship but in
[1:34:42] the in the one dimension we are also
[1:34:46] sons and daughters
[1:34:49] in that relationship we want to please
[1:34:52] our father to do his will and to be
[1:34:57] obedient
[1:34:58] depending on our age he can sometimes
[1:35:02] sometimes you can correct that chasten
[1:35:05] us and all this is done through love all
[1:35:10] this is love back and forth I remember
[1:35:13] when I was about 27 years old
[1:35:17] I start working then I went to back from
[1:35:22] back I went vacation to my parents and
[1:35:26] my father has suggested that I
[1:35:30] I marry
[1:35:32] a lady
[1:35:34] if I was a single 27 28 and
[1:35:39] he had an idea that like we will be
[1:35:43] really compatible and all kind of things
[1:35:46] and I I say to him no I cannot do that
[1:35:50] and he said to me everything that I tell
[1:35:53] you you just say no
[1:35:56] well the problem is he was you know it
[1:35:59] was in denomination I already had the
[1:36:02] message all right
[1:36:04] and I look like a Rebel Son it was not a
[1:36:09] good feeling
[1:36:10] but when it comes to things like if he
[1:36:14] asked me to do some task I was one of
[1:36:18] the best of children until his death I
[1:36:21] was always taking care of him but when
[1:36:24] it came to Faith things about what we
[1:36:28] believe
[1:36:29] I looked so weird so he said to me but
[1:36:33] you you don't
[1:36:36] everything that I tell you you don't
[1:36:39] like to hear it's like I cannot tell you
[1:36:42] anything that is good but I remember the
[1:36:45] conversation went like I say to him
[1:36:47] father a son
[1:36:50] always like to please his father
[1:36:55] that's what is in us even a house where
[1:37:00] there is issues something inside the son
[1:37:04] and daughter is to please
[1:37:06] it is something that God has placed but
[1:37:10] I can't do it
[1:37:12] I cannot do this because we don't marry
[1:37:15] outside of our faith
[1:37:20] you see
[1:37:23] our desire is to please our heavenly
[1:37:27] father
[1:37:28] if we can do this for the Earthly father
[1:37:31] what about our heavenly father desire is
[1:37:36] to do his will whatever you want us to
[1:37:39] do that's what we want to do because we
[1:37:42] are afraid of punishment no there is
[1:37:45] something deeper than just seismment
[1:37:48] there is a relationship something that
[1:37:51] God has made we are part of him we are
[1:37:54] part of the family
[1:37:57] we are raised to become more like him
[1:38:02] therefore every time the word comes we
[1:38:06] should never have excuse against the
[1:38:09] word of God God has really blessed us
[1:38:12] even especially this church God has
[1:38:16] given us the word of life let us show
[1:38:21] him our love to him by obeying that word
[1:38:26] by living it because he cannot give it
[1:38:30] to us without allowing us to live it
[1:38:34] amen he has made provision for it it's
[1:38:39] uh it is for our God it was for my
[1:38:42] maturity it is for us to air
[1:38:46] we are if
[1:38:50] the son next door is not here but you
[1:38:53] are
[1:38:54] amen do you believe that
[1:38:57] God bless you uh let's let's all stand
