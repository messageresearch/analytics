[0:00] I say God help me whenever it comes head
[0:02] to head with the word help me die
[0:04] quickly when I find out I've been wrong
[0:06] maybe I've been doing something wrong
[0:08] I've been doing it wrong for years I was
[0:10] ignorant I didn't know but all of a
[0:11] sudden God brings the word on the scene
[0:13] let me quickly say I died of myself so
[0:15] the word can take its place and now I
[0:17] can become more of the word made flesh
[0:21] that's the age that we're living in how
[0:24] are we going to do it how's the bride go
[0:25] up word by word
[0:28] how do you surrender word by word
[0:30] decision by decision day by day amen it
[0:34] wasn't one time at the altar it's all
[0:35] over now no it's every day I'm
[0:38] surrendering a little more every day I'm
[0:40] putting myself lower my desires my will
[0:42] my ones and I'm taking the word and
[0:45] letting the word be my my life letting
[0:47] the word be my decision what's your
[0:49] decision whatever the word says that's
[0:51] my decision what will you do whatever
[0:53] the word says that's what I do and
[0:54] that's how the word is made flesh
[0:58] sometimes we make things too mystical
[1:02] where the the word is becoming flesh and
[1:04] the flesh is becoming the word you can
[1:06] say it's so mystical but there's no
[1:08] practical application you go back out
[1:10] and keep doing the same things we always
[1:11] did manifesting the same life it becomes
[1:14] so mystical now where there were the
[1:16] brides the word made flesh she will be
[1:17] the anointed one for this day if you
[1:19] keep it in the mystical Realms you'll
[1:21] keep living the same way we've always
[1:23] lived
[1:24] but when we bring it down to the
[1:26] practicality and say you know what every
[1:28] time I come into a headbutt a Crossroads
[1:31] with this word I am going to take the
[1:33] word and die to myself and put the word
[1:35] and that is how the word is being made
[1:37] flesh in our day that's why she's the
[1:40] anointed when she's anointed by God to
[1:42] lay down her life and let his life take
[1:45] preeminence
[1:47] that's how we are the anointed one and
[1:49] that's how the bride is the word for
[1:51] this day
[1:52] don't just leave it off mystically it'll
[1:56] magically happen it's magically
[1:58] happening when God convicts your heart
[2:01] when God brings you face to face with
[2:03] the word and something inside of you is
[2:05] willing to die that's that is the
[2:07] mystical part taking place right there
[2:09] that's the mystery becoming unveiled
[2:12] that's the mystical that's the
[2:13] Supernatural That's God dealing in your
[2:15] heart amen don't wait for magic potion
[2:17] and fairy dust and all of a sudden I
[2:19] step into a perfect condition no we're
[2:21] growing into it day by day we're
[2:23] surrendering more and more this is the
[2:25] reality
[2:29] praise God
[2:31] it's a lot harder than we thought 20
[2:33] years ago
[2:35] we thought God would flip the switch and
[2:37] it's all done and I'm the manifested
[2:39] word
[2:40] no we're becoming word we're going up
[2:43] word by word
[2:46] as the word gets clearer I come in
[2:49] greater subjection
[2:51] as the word comes fresh I'm surrendering
[2:54] more as I see how wrong I was I see my
[2:58] wrong motives I see my wrong desire and
[3:00] all sudden I Repent I don't repent from
[3:02] doing wrong I Repent from thinking wrong
[3:07] I'm not repenting from I'm not repenting
[3:11] from doing wrong to my brother I'm
[3:12] thinking I'm repenting of thinking wrong
[3:15] about my brother
[3:16] you see how the words bringing more a
[3:19] more reality bringing more manifestation
[3:24] no more white sepulchers but let it be
[3:26] true on the inside
[3:28] and manifest on the outside so that the
[3:31] visible becomes the manifestation of the
[3:35] invisible
