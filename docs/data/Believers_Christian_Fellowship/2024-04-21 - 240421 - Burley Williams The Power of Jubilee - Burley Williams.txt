the deacons brother Jonathan bomgardner brother Ilia they've been so instrumental in helping me drive there and drive back and they've really been a big help and I just want to take a minute to thank them for their sacrifice and for what they've helped with and thank you all for your prayers it's been a wonderful time to see what God's doing amen praise God I'm excited to hear the word of God I'm excited to receive another portion from heaven for me something that I need and I'm here to hear for myself to receive from God for me and so you all know I'll be in my favorite seat in the building next to my wife pulling on the word of God but let's all do the same we're going to invite brother Burley if we can just sing another song will more than ever before Lord I love you more than ever before Lord I need you more than ever before I want to tell you my Lord I love you now more than ever before [Music] amen God bless you this morning that's all I can get wow God bless you this morning wow we we should be saying hallelujah Shalom praise God that's what we should be excited amen we just thank God for for the CH allowing us to come by your way this morning and uh we just uh going to look into the word um I would like to uh just invite you to turn into the scriptures I'm not too good of an introductory person when I get something scriptures in my mind I try to just get into it quick so it won't leave so if you will let's turn to uh Leviticus chapter 25 and uh uh I want to brother Franco change that title brother uh I just want to if I can just preach on the power of Jubilee the power of Jubilee I might uh have a different approach but it's the same Revelation and uh that's one thing I learned in this time to preach a appreciate a minister for what he is cuz we're all different true and it don't got so sad around the message that you have to be put in categories now that's very sad amen because uh a Ministry is not for themselves it gifts is for the bride and and God that's what God give the gifts for us for the Perfection perfecting of the church perfecting of the Saints and uh he got different ways and different that's why it's a five-fold Ministry cuz we got different angles way we look at things but it should be a respect there can we say praise the Lord it should be a respect the Evangelist can't the Evangelist can't say the teacher should have screamed a little louder the teacher can't say the Evangelist the Evangelist should have went a little deeper that's wrong you got to respect them for exactly what they are praise the Lord uh let Leviticus 25: 23 he said the land the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine for you are strangers and sojourners with me let us pray father we just want to thank you for the reading of your word and we just want to commit everything into our hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated amen it's good to see gab God bless you brother you know for Chad told me take my Liberty and uh I'm just thankful you know go ahead and take this old jacket off um I do thank God for the being able to come Minister here and uh brother Paula Fain good friend of mine and uh I'm thankful cuz I feel comfortable I can be myself well I'm going to be myself either way I go I mean what I'm saying is sometimes uh people want to put you in a bottle or something and you ain't preaching like the other brother said stuff I'm now I'm I don't have a complex I'm over that I've been over that kind of stuff cuz I just going to be cuz you more effective if you just be exactly who you are amen right and however God uses you to speak just do it cuz the way God works sometimes you can preach you can preach you can preach and then feel like you ain't said nothing and that's when God did something then you can preach like you really done something then God didn't do nothing that's right praise the Lord sometime you can leave the pull pit defeated I'm telling y'all preacher Secrets man I just didn't get don't feel like I got nothing across and you talk to God I know what I studied Lord I I know what you gave me it just seemed like you beat yourself up right then somebody come to you brother that service You Preach really helped me you be like really that's because God done something and that's all you can do as a minister just you yourself to him cuz he knows all our needs would it be sad if every would it be sad if the congregation would call the pastor in the morning and say I need you to preach on this and this going on in my house and you know but it'll seem like there'll be a spiritual Pastor people like why he got discernment it don't work like that but God he knows everything praise the Lord and I thank and I thank him for that amen so uh uh I might do a little something uh a little different to the norm but it's for a purpose I'm not an Entertainer you know is I don't know who this preacher was but he made a statement he said the the uh he said the SEC secular singers has become the gospel singers the gospel singers has become the secular singers then he said the motivational speakers have become the preachers and the preachers have become the motivational speakers I said you owned something that was in uh 98 a preacher said that not a message preacher he said that and you can see it today praise the Lord you know we we we don't post to pre now I'm I'm going to say something but you can look it up yourself type in the message persuade and persuasion that's right just read them that's quotes and quotes and quot it's a s for for sway you're going to see 11 quotes and uh I I watched something that the prophet was saying about it uh you would hear him say may Lord I preach and persuade people he'll say that that's in the 50s then as it goes up he'll start talking about persuasion then he comes to a place that the days of persuasion is over then as he comes up he said it makes no different how much I persuade you if the word don't convict you amen ain't much in it so there's a sense of persuasion that we do Paul said he persuade man with persuade is also a influence can we say Amen but it goes both ways a bad influence can be a persuasion a good influence can be a persuasion because even God when God was talking to the host in heaven about Ahab falling he said who could I who could what can we do to cause him to fall a Spirit came up and said I persuade him yeah so there's a good persuasion there's a bad persuasion but I want to say this the most thing that we really need is not persuasive preaching but pre conviction preaching cuz when somebody is convicted you'll find the prophet said some come to the altar he said you come not by persuasion but you come by conviction and that's is very very important to have a conviction somebody can talk you into anything or persuade you influence you into something but if a conviction is not there it's not going to hold but when you are convicted about something ain't nothing going to talk you out of that cuz it's a true conviction that don't took place in your life amen now I believe well I know you know what Jubilee is I know you've been taught these things we've been taught these things we we we listen to them year after year after year but I myself were looking at some things about Jubilee and uh I couldn't find out Jubilee is predestination it's actually predestination because a jubilee is literally not for everybody that's right I'm like then when I begin to study these things when I see a jubilee is not for everybody then can I realize why they jubilee don't hold praise the Lord you can't separate Jubilee and atonement praise God they run together praise the lord well we'll just work our way to it I'm I'm glad you're thinking but I don't come to just throw something at you but I come to it's important because I believe this message is our Jubilee I believe the Holy Ghost is our Jubilee amen is for is to bring us out of bondage and everything that we have lost is for us to return and get it back praise the Lord now now we we just want to uh in the scripture that we read in Leviticus 25 which I got several quotes that I want to want to use now we know that there's a a it's called a year of release yes now we know there's a sevene year of release but when it come to the Jubilee It Go up to 50 years which is 7 * 7 which is 50 that is a jubilee right there's a there somewhat the same but yet there also differences inside of it that's right and uh we want to see these things in the scripture and in the message and one thing I like about this in uh Leviticus 25 God said the land shall not be so forever I want you to think about this he said the land shall not be sold forever but at this particular time they are not even in their promised land they ain't even got there yet why is God saying it in Leviticus then cuz he knew they was going to sell out he knew they was going to mess up he knew that but he had to put something there to make sure they get it back amen God knew you and I going to sell out on some things we have done it that's right that's why he predestinated us so those things will have to return back to us make no difference how long it is have to return so I say that to say this we as the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't lose we get everything back we might go through some dark times some dark Seasons what do that have to do with predestination what that got to do with the election we going to we going to come out on the [Music] end praise the Lord let me just say it's kind of humble cmer Spirit you know when you bu in the pool pit I had a brother tell me the other day he said brother I'm just behind the pull pit shaking and I'm nervous I said that's good he like I said yeah that's wonderful that's cuz whenever you get to a place you come out there comfortable we in trouble now you're relying on yourself cu the longer you stay nervous that let me know you you trusting in the Lord and you don't want to say nothing out of terms you and and away from the word I so you're in a good State praise the Lord I don't never want to come up here I got this oh I'm going to really let no I promise you you come up like that you'll go down humble cuz God won't do nothing that's why we come and just say Lord whatever you want I just want to preach whatever you give me just let me preach it and and and it's wonderful you know I've been on a little thing uh too about Harmony and unity lately myself because you know you can see a lot of things what the prophet says about Harmony and Harmony and unity uh they sound like the same word somewh have certain certain meanings as the same but actually it's a difference that's right and I just like to use a little little little allergy not allergy allegory or whatever you want to put it I always uh I like to put it in the state of people living in a subdivision anybody live in a subdivision you know when you live in a subdivision it's a spirit there could be not saying good or bad just just it's a spirit it's a Spirit of Harmony right you know and you're in you're in your subdivision some of them gated communities and so forth and and then you know you walking down the road and the neighbor walking down the road got their dog and you got your dog Hey Joe hey how you doing Raph good old harmony right get on Harmony hey then everybody they know everybody name hey how you doing Harmony you know in the subdivision you got to keep your grass cut you don't keep your grass cut and then then you get out there let me cut the grass cuz I don't want to hear that mouth keep your trim your head just trimmed got your crime watch signs and all that kind of stuff that's some beautiful Harmony man isn't it and then you know uh uh a strange car come in the neighborhood and all of a sudden do you do you you see that car yeah then all of a sudden you can see blinds people looking you know that's a good thing something strange happening in the neighborhood and and uh that's a good Harmony right but yet that's not Unity that's Harmony that's not Unity cuz in that same subdivision you got Pentecostals you got Baptists message Believers apostolics so if you was in unity all of you would be believing the same thing but that's Harmony special election Time by iding sign Trump sign different yards so where's the unity there is none there just Harmony then you find out in election time how really good your neighbor actually are when one talk about Trump what happened to hey Ral hey stress right amen so that's not unity in that same subdivision of Baptist could come and tell you my wife been promoted on the job will you yes oh yes of I'm so happy for you we going to have a little party for come on over and join us we going to have a little wine you go no so now you don't broke y'all so-called Harmony look at you think you different than us see it's no Unity cuz if it a Unity you would be believing the same thing see God want us to be in united with him unified with him by what the word can we say Amen now brother Ram says this he says uh uh he Jesus one day hit a crowd he said he just took a man by his hand and led him outside of the city spit on the ground made mud put it on his eyes and told him to go wash and the next day he come seeing he said he went into a place where they were all screaming on the can of a little girl that just died laughing at him cuz he said she wasn't dead he put them everyone out of the house went in he see you got to have Unity Harmony everything in one Accord then the Holy Spirit should never have to be one prayer here on the platform he going to another Direction but I want to point out what he said they all have to work together Unity Harmony and everything in one Accord there's a degree we can be in harmony with each other on certain things but God won't us to be unified and that's only way that's going to happen is by the word we can have disagreements about something amen still be friends but when we can be unified with one another we'll take the word of God say let's look and see what the message says let's put our thoughts completely out of it and just see what God is saying that'll bring us into a Unity can we say Amen you see that's why even in uh house Life Family Life when your children is raised up they are in harmony with you but if they are not born again they are not in unity with you some of you like praise the Lord they in harmony they that's Mom that's my dad so I respect them I love him that's good Harmony but then when Mom and Dad take them to to the word and say you know you can't do this because of the word they be like I I I I just feel like I should live my own life I I I I don't I can't follow that see there's no Unity if that child had the Holy Spirit and that would y'all could be unified by the word that brings a unity in the family so we can harmony with one another but what about Unity same as marriage do you want Harmony in your marriage only we want Harmony in unity see in Harmony in a marriage you can say that's my wife that's my husband I love her and we just love each other wonderful that's great but when it start having family structure and so forth then uh the husband say one thing the children can do then the wife say one thing the children can do and then when they tell the child I wouldn't let you do that I would let you do it you know mama going to let you mama would but Daddy you you know how daddy is so I can't let you do it that's not Unity but Unity is when Mom and Daddy saying the exact same thing by the word of God daddy say no mama say no then you say children no because the word of God said no we're not doing it that's the unity can we say praise the Lord so we want to be unified with the word uh some ministers get little offended with me you know I love ministers meeting and stuff I said well it's a ministers meeting I said but most of them is harmony meetings it's cuz you leave the minister meeting a accomplish nothing in the word but just good ideas no if it's going to be a minister meeting let's be unified around the word see what the prophet said see what the scripture said and leave it at that he told me take my Liberty brother these things are important very important in this day and time praise the Lord now jubile I just love this when God said the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine God let them know this is my land but we but he told Abraham I'm giving you this land and your children this land right but God said it's mind it's kind of can put it to you in a parable like this it's just like if you give your child a car but you got the title amen you got the title then the son that decide I'm going to get rid of this car get me another one then he come home you say what where's that car he oh I just got rid of it you know what that pan can do he got that title he can go down there who you sold it to he can go down there and say give me that car back that man say no yo this guy sold this to me he said yeah that gu is my son but I got the title now you give it back to me can we say Amen don't you realize this kind of what this is God said this land is mine and it ain't going to be sold forever it got to come back to me but I look at it more than just natural land this land is also God's land so that lets me know you and I we might can be sold out for a while go through things for a while but God said that's my son that's my daughter they belong to me and Satan you can only keep them for so long praise the Lord oh you all right this morning in [Music] Jubilee I like this uh in Leviticus God makes sure in Jubilee which we're going to go to Leviticus in a moment God make sure that in the Jubilee that the inheritance won't be lost that's a powerful law that he made the year of jubile that's powerful to make sure we lose nothing it's the same that God predestinate us unto adoption how many you believe we've been predestinated to adoption that lets me know whatever God have planed in my life for me to come what position he has planned for me to come there's nothing going to stop that there ain't no trial going to stop that there ain't no situation going to stop that I'm going to get exactly where he want me to get to that's encouraging to me because many times we can look down on ourselves but that don't change God view that he has about you is that right everything that happens to the elect it makes no different what it is we come out on The Winning Side the Bible show us where some Believers seem to be trapped in situation seem to be like they deceived in situation they always come out of the Bible is full of so many example we always come out God makes sure of that praise the Lord now let's just go to Leviticus for a moment and we also know the scripture say all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord and you remember we always preach all things don't mean good things them things could be bad things but they all going to work too good aren't you thankful for that now but Brams here in the message returned in Jubilee He says this now if somehow or other the individual lost their inheritance I like the way he put it somehow or another other words something don't happen that they don't lost it he said that was given to them by God there came a year called The Jubilee every seven years they had a rest a Sabbath every seven days they had a Sabbath every seven years they had a Sabbath and every seven Sabbath was 49 years the 50th year was Jubilee He just going from a week to seven years to 50 years just that's what he's doing he said in this Jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance he says it again by some means this is the real beautiful part by some means he says this if he was a Freeborn true blooded Israelite see that's why I was telling Jubilee is not for everybody it say it says here he's a free born blooded Israelite that means that puts that means that Jubilee he's going to get it regardless can we say amen I I just love this he says right here he said it he said if he's a was a Freeborn true blooded Israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay anything he didn't have to do anything but stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance other words he don't s sold out his land or whatever he sold out in them Years be going by you know what one day he out there sweating trying to pay off the debt or whatever but then that trumpet sound when he hear that trumpet blow he can just stop anything and you know one thing I like about it it makes no different one thing about a jubilee if he haven't paid the person that he sold out to the full amount of the money if he haven't paid it all it don't matter when the Jubilee come it says it's paid in full praise the Lord what you saying brother bur I say this that trumpet he Prophet said it's that go gospel trumpet when you hear that gospel trumpet it means that you can be free that tells me I can tell the devil I don't owe you nothing no more I I'm free I can walk out free no more complexes can we say Amen everything that I have done I now I can walk walk away from it and my freedom you got to hear that gospel trumpet cuz when that's when that Jew out there hoing and so forth when that trumpet go you know what other people are hearing it too other people are hearing it but he's the only one responding cuz he knows the meaning behind it he be like w yeah they like what is wrong with you you better you better pick up and start work oh no I'm free now he h the trumpet so this message is not for everybody but when the bride hear this message she knows this is my freedom this is my Liberty but then you get some said this is bondage no this is freedom this is Liberty tells me I can overcome sin I can live above sin can we say Amen it tells me I can doubt my doubts it tells me I'm free Jubilee He Oh my he had a right to it it was God giv right because he by Grace had inherited it and been given to his father handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free now he said it meant Grace is way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance so juvilee was also their Grace remember the land shall not be sold Forever Friends I take that so personally that me the devil could not keep me forever because God makes sure that burle will were going to hear this gospel trumpet one day and and he was going to recognize it that he can be free he said what a picture to give us tonight of the church in the last days you see what man can do then you can see what God does What man does is failing and will fail has fail and always will fail but what God does is eternal it must forever remain nothing can take it away God give it is his free gift and by Sovereign foresight saw it placed it and there nothing could ever move it is there eternally and he said and at Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people for restoring or be brought back to their rightful position so Jubilee is predestination God knew you and I was going to mess up but let me plant a seed in here let me put something in here that one day when that Light Strike it it'll wake up and they'll realize it's me pulling you calling you praise God are y'all going to preach with me let's go down a little further here I got something I want to do I'm just building up to it this might like how many of y'all know you a you are a kinsman redeemer not only just Jesus as a k Redeemer when you be born again you become one how I read it to you morning some of you that's okay that lets me know you're listening I'm so glad y'all not one of those churches soon as a minister say the prophet say ah a but never did read the quote see too much of that let him finish the quote said Prophet say ah amen okay then a lot of time you read the quote something that's against then it be like oh no we say Amen to what we believe what we can say Amen too there the word you know Leviticus 25:29 he said if a man sells a dwelling house in a wall City then he may redeem it in a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it and if he be not if and if he if it be not redeemed within the the space of a full year then the house that is in the wall City shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout his generation it shall no not go out in the Jubilee now watch this right here if it's in a wall City it's a limited time that it can come out but if it's not in a wall City whenever they hear that trumpet that Jubilee trumpet it could come out so there's a time space here and I like the way the prophet going to put it I'll read it to you in a moment he said verse 31 but the houses of The Villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the Jubilee then brother bam he be to uh explain these things I really didn't understand what these mean to I heard him say what it mean amen now let's just read the quote we'll just kind of BL it in together now he going to also talk about in the scriptures it's just so amazing sometimes a stranger could come amongst Israel and work for them then the stranger can get rich just for working and when he get rich The Stranger can buy a brother that's right right which is sad now you got the stranger Divine the brother that's sad are you with me but he brought that out he said if the rich servant this is the returning Jubilee a man come in become a servant and got rich notice a servant and got rich and he bought a brother that brother could be Redeemed by a Kinsman a Kinsman could come get him in the year jubile and could redeem him he said what a beautiful Christ here we have a beautiful picture rather of Christ that a pilgrim out there in a bond sold out to the rich cities out there sold out into the richest organizations what he's doing now he's taking that to this age of Rich cuz this is the lay of the sin age when you see a brother or sister still stuck in those systems listen what he says now he said but a Kinsman brother who know he's out there some night I love it put his Bible under his arm and go after him of kinsman because he got the same Spirit he's born in the same family God called him out of that group so guess what when you yourself become a Believer you become born again you can have another predestinated seed trapped out there in them systems God can send you you out there to bring them back and show them you don't belong there God got something for you come out of her my people right that's also rest in us that's right what you think they doing your pastor different on you going doing Bible studies what are you doing you playing the role of a kinsman redeemer yourself because those are your brothers and sisters and you're trying to pull them out praise God now you might say wow what about they if they ain't really born again how can they be your brother I'm speaking for as the way God see things that could be of predestinated seed we just working prise God and the word had to come through the body to get to another body that's right he's the king from Redeemer had that picture he said how that picture was portrayed wonderfully in the Book of Ruth Boaz when he was taking the place of a k Redeemer representing Christ are you with me yes sir let's just keep going just a little bit longer cuz I don't want to hold you long so Jubilee in the Old Testament they could return back to their possessions and land and so forth but when it come to the New Testament God wasn't too much focused on land and stuff like that he was focused on this land that's right because when Jesus came to begin to preach the acceptable year of the Gospel that was a jubilee that's right but he wasn't looking for natural land that's he was looking for these that's what he was calling for a jubilee come to set them at libert them that are abundant set them at Liberty the captiv free that was a jubilee but look at all them rejected that Jubilee but there was some pred inated to receive that Jubilee right yes sir are you with me yes sir so that's what this message have come to you and me brothers and sisters it is our Jubilee now I want to do something you know there's traps this might be more towards younger people but it's important there's traps and snares everywhere and the devil start working on you while you're young is that right I couldn't run across some people to today was just bullied when they was young and it'll still affect them to today they just can't seem to get over it God can help you get over that praise the Lord remember I gave y'all my testimony I was one of the bullies that bullied bullies and I quite enjoyed it because I just could not see somebody overtaking somebody helplessly and they just enjoyed I just couldn't take it no we have to do something about that and people get scarred on things like that but you as a young person when you come into church you should listen listen when your pastor is preaching I like brother bam said when the word Goes Forth he said the Holy Spirit follows it it follows it that's right and what you have to do be a re receive what God is saying through that word and apply it to yourself a lot of times you hear things your pastor say different ministers saying you ain't even even going through it that don't mean you just say it ain't got didn't do with me no you need to grab that and store it in your heart drive that as you begin to grow in life and things start happening in your life them words could come back to you to show you how to avoid that or either overcome that or how to deal with that don't just throw it out you're here for a reason if there's going to be another generation you're that generation and it's such an honor you should have you should see young people to be able to just sit around the word I'm I'm talking to you from my heart cuz the people that I do Bible study with them some messed up children that's right the things that they go through I'm like wow and you have to deal with them but yet you're sitting under the reveal word of the hour God helping you ton not to get that type of stuff so don't be adventurous in your mind curious what's going on out there what are they doing no I'm telling you curiosity kill the cat and that Curiosity will do the same thing to you you don't have to try to wonder what's going on out there no stay right here stay right in the word don't worry about nothing else just stay in the message cuz it's important we can't make you do it though we we can just encourage praise the Lord cuz traps the the devil brings trap so slick until they look you remember sin look beautiful it's a pilling but yet death is sitting right behind it that's how the devil works are you with me yes sir let me read some more things to you I'm still on Jubilee believe it or not we going to just work our way around cuz I believe in Freedom amen that's one of the saddest thing you can see a message believer in bondage like the prophet talk about the eagle in in a cage when we supposed to be living in freedom and liberty that's right praise the Lord even while we going through our trials that's right still might look weary on the outside but inside it's bubbling encouraging inside I got to keep pressing on Jesus says this in Matthew 6 no man can serve two masters for he either will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God in Mamon that don't need no interpretation it just exactly what he said you can't serve two masters then he comes in Luke 14 he says Luke 1425 it said there came a great there went a great multitude with him he turned and said to to them think great multitude just coming around Jesus looks at him he turns and say to them if a man come to me hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters yeah in his own life he cannot be my disciple some of them probably say what kind of sermon is this that's right here we is coming with big happy Hearts want to hear the good gospel the good news and you going to turn around tell me hate my mom really see Jesus could pick up they want they want to follow him now follow him now oh you want to follow me he said let me see how bad you really want to follow me he wasn't talking about I hate you mama no that a what he talking about what he's talking about you can't put none of that before me none of it I was talking to a young boy having marriage problems cuz he done this one is not a Believer I said let me tell you something son I said your mama don't become before your wife that's right huh that's right your daddy your brother your sister your best friend your favorite cousin none of them become before your wife that's right I said because you don't have a vow with neither one of them yes I said your vow is to your wife I said same for her her daddy her mama don't come before you she didn't make a vow with them she made a vow to you it goes both ways so it can't be like well Daddy said honey I ain't going to be able to do that cuz I need to go do something for Daddy no no no no no no no no no right you don't make that agreement with Daddy when dad say son can you come run and do something for him he say hey hey Dad let me check with my wife see what she got going on hello somebody sir and the wife can't be like well you know I need to go do something too and I just get no no no no say honey there's anything going on Mama Mama want to take us want to take me shopping and have a little tea said I ain't got nothing going on baby you go ahead on it can't be like I'll be back where you going baby me and mama having tea got to have some respect man when it comes to the end of the day we put God before all of it yes sir when Jesus was talking about except you hate mother father brother sisters I think I really believe his thoughts was coming from Exodus when he was quoting the scripture and I'll read it to you in a moment I believe this where his thoughts was coming from because he's showing something in the New Testament these things can be traps if you put them before me there'll be traps that's right yeah and let me show you where I believe he was getting that from turn to Exodus 21 I don't know what time I started but y'all can give me a few more minutes can't you Exodus 21 to be honest I have an honest confession brother Chad this something I had been wanting to do years ago cuz I know y'all got good recording stuff I've done this what I'm going to do several times but I like for be nice so people could just see it not for entertainment but could learn something from it how crafty that devil actually is Exodus 21:1 now these are the Judgment which Thou shalt set before them as thou by and Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he come in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife and she have borne him Sons and Daughters the wife and the children shall be her Masters and she shall and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free then his master shall bring him to the judges he shall also bring him to the door of the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear with an awe and he shall serve him forever can y'all see familiar language in there from Luke chapter 14 to this this is I believe what Jesus was getting this from showing traps I'm I'm going to do something for you who was that brother name with the Justin Justin where is Justin what's the last name HOSA

have children they can they have to stay but you can go if I remember correctly right yeah remember that okay and I did give you a wife yes so you know what that mean they all belong to me now you can go that's your very right you can go but they can't right they belong to me so it's up to you now if you want to stay and you become mine I would really like that but if you want your freedom you have to you can go but they can't right so now what's it going to be are you going to go or you going to stay with them got stay with them right you going to stay with them go for Freedom you going to stay with them that's your choice I need to know what your choice is right yeah take some thinking on that one because you don't you got no I need I need an answer right now I I I need an answer so I gotta go you going to stay or go go you going to leave them that' be hard look at look at them yeah so you're going to leave them and go on by yourself that's what you going to do that's your choice look at him and tell them yeah for for yeah three free I have to then I can hopefully come back and no you can't come back it's done man when you go you gone it's done right so we got to know right now cuz this is no common this is period right it's tough I know it's tough yeah but once you say the word there ain't going to be no coming back no court of appeal nothing it's dying so tell them what you're going to do stay with them you going to stay with them okay now I'm going to ask y'all a question young people did he make the right decision come on young people did he make the right decision he said he going to stay did he make the right decision see it's quiet he made the wrong decision now he just sold out his freedom and he didn't realize it's been a trap all along he got so caught up into her and what I was telling her to do he couldn't see what I was doing but now he don't come to a place I have to make a decision you see that's what the devil do all through your life and then it come to that place when God deals with your heart now you got to make a decision man I have to confess certain things right I have to repent some things that oh oh man but I was having so much fun when I was doing it but I got to make that right to serve the Lord what I'm going to do right now that's a trap yeah yeah but if you want your freedom you would be willing Lord whatever that's right I need to let go I'll let it go cuz you remember the scripture say he said I love my master and you can't serve two right this what Jesus was getting that thought from right you see how it was you see how it kind of little reality to he said that's tough and that's the way it is when you don't got yourself caught up into all kind of stuff now God the Holy Spirit on start dealing with you that's right now you're in a valley of decision that's right what I'm going to do now that's why I'm here to tell you as young watch everything through prayer and the word cuz the devil got trapped he just got them laying there see in the book of Nehemiah or Israel when they come out of Babylon the Bible say they married strange wives That's Right Nehemiah told him if you want to go on with the Lord and prosper get rid of them wives and them children that's right you know how painful that was but they did it that's right they did it so they can be free see God want us to be free that's right when you hear rebuking in the word it's not to B put you in bondage it's to expose error so you can get away from that stuff not trying to kill you or hurt you trying to get you to a place now while you're young that when you get older you don't have to come to these decisions right look how he don't have a bun now he just can't look at them and say I'm out of here no that's why the devil want to make you get into some covenants with him on some things and his traps on all behind it can be job traps friend traps boy traps girl traps it's all kind of them right and if you ain't careful it going to cost you a hard time right that's why the prophet said this is the age a Christian need to be on his toes more than any age is this age these things are important there are Minister traps Church traps it's all all kinds of them now come on over here get me a hammer oh now he belongs to me and the prophet said when you start rejecting the word what does it start you st wanting to hear you don't want to hear it no more I'm tired of hearing this I'm tired of the that's the devil he can't serve two Master let's get him a hand you see I don't know if y'all heard him at first he said I'm going to go free he said I'm going then he he kind of look this tell he brother and sisters this message is a jubilee that's right but you T all those things again it shows traps that's right look at the one that got trapped by the house in a wall City that's and the scripture said for generations for Generations it still would be no Redemption for it no bringing it back and the prophet brought that thing around that's why when you hear people say I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a Pentecostal they identifying I'm stuck in a wall that's right for generations for Generation that's why a Baptist bring a back forth a Baptist a Methodist bring for a Methodist cuz that's where the inheritance at is behind a wall the walls of Babylon the walls of denomination but God told us come out come out of her my people that's my message to you this morning this message is Jubilee can we get the Lord a [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hand I didn't cover every thing but I think enough been said my hardest to the young people decisions your decisions you make today will affect your tomorrow let me tell you something a wife house husband all of these things is add-ons sir that's all they are the first thing is seek you first the kingdom of God that's the first then God give the add-ons yes that's important let's talk to a young man he been married now a little over a year he come to me sharing things with me I'm glad he love me cuz I be laughing at him he tell me things going on with him and the wife he say this m w mm I said let me tell you something fell I said you just in Ephesians of your marriage I said yeah yes you're in your Ephesians of your marriage I said whatever you do stay there cuz you remember brother and sister it never would have been a layer to see an age if a eesan was fixed that's right so when you don't fix your eesan you go to the next age in your marriage we say what do you mean by staying in my Ephesian remember aimed and relaxed that's right right right if you stay aimed in your marriage stay aimed to please for marriage to grow in the higher things of God stay aimed at that you'll stay in your Ephesian but if you get relaxed in your marriage you'll go to another stage how many y'all know what relaxing in the marriage is in the feian church age what did he said they had a less watchful attitude you get into your marriage now you ain't watching everything you ain't watching his emotions she's not watching he's not watching hers not paying attention what offends then get to the place ah get over we've been married long enough you shouldn't even let that bother you any way see now you actually getting up to your lay of the seal in your marriage where you got your own rights and she got hers but if you stay the Ephesian watching aiming to please come on now oh come on you know how it is what happened sister in courtship when you knew he was coming over but you got a sister how do I look she you look good okay okay he comes to the door you already at the door he knocks at the door hear each other breathing you open the door you ready he just look at beautiful but then you get married brother come home for work rollers in the head and what he said what what we're married we so I'm cooking I don't want to have be looking good on I'm cooking in what happened see you got to keep aiming that's right got to keep aiming what he likes let me do what he likes that's mean you aiming it can't be whatever that's right you got to be the same way bro what What She Likes what she want to do what can I do for her marriage is a sacrifice man but when God is in it that love is in it he just keeps it together praise the lord lord amen you know you get a man sometimes you got to be careful on the job the Buddies man you want to go

where the devil want to get to but you got to have that helmet on have that Shield of Faith he's that them darts come we got to put that whole armor on brother and sisters can we get the Lord a hand God bless you amen that's just what's on my heart I trust the young people just let that stay in your spirit just let it stay in your spirit cuz them traps promise you many adults in here can tell I made those mistakes and I see what it cost me and it could be some of it can be very very painful so the opportunity you guys have today is a blessing amen can we pray musicians could come Heavenly Father sometimes we just don't know which direction to go but we know we have things burning in our hearts it's because it's something you have given us and I had many thoughts on my heart this morning Lord but we just felt the leading to go this way my heart just go out so much in this time for family young people but the devil just attacking in so many different ways now taking away family time taking away the altar out of the home the altar out of the home been placed with Instagram Facebook Tik Tok then we wonder what is going on all of these things could be used for the good Lord but they're so time consuming and take so much time get caught up into ads things popping up and all these things you don't even want to see suggestions you don't even want the suggestion because the way these things are designed whenever you search it makes a pattern for you to throw things out what it think you're looking for the intelligence of an AI the intelligent of all these things the devil is all behind it Lord but father may we watch what we say watch what we do watch what we hear and be mindful of the word let that word stand between us let's walk with the word in our hearts with conviction of the Holy Spirit when he say no we say thank you Lord when he say yes we say thank you Lord so we just give everything in our hands in the name of Jesus Christ father we pray amen you know huh Spirits never die that's right right you know Trump some of you might be voting for them it don't make no difference to me I don't vote for none of them but if you a trump person I'm just going to be honest with you you just dealing with a modernday Constantine that's who you're dealing with the spirit of Constantine is on Trump look at the Trump Bible Trump Bible what you think that guy is doing you using the same maneuver to get Church religion on his side and it sounds so beautiful but it's all just ushering in the mark of the beast is also ushering in the pressure that he going to bring from the denominations to the bride he's a perfect candidate for that that what Constantine did Same Spirit Trump Bible and then he says put prayer back in America again put God back in America again he said out of his own mouth we need to put the power back in the church that sound good don't it just a trap but we know better how do we know better because of this message I believe more now when brother Brandon was preaching yes it was for them back when he was preaching with them but it's more so now for us yes sir cuz we back then people thought he was crazy but we see we see what he was saying that's what the prophet said that's what the prophet said back in his day hope was said nonsense that's ridiculous no no no no we see everything being unfold right before our eyes and I thank God for that God bless you but [Applause] amen let's all stand together and how many are thankful that brother Burley was comfortable being brother Burley I believe the Lord used him for our benefit amen and what a visual for all of us not just the young but for all of us God has made us free yeah let's stay free amen let's not get caught in any trap that will bind us later on down the road I I love where he said be pray careful and Be watchful and stay with the word God gave us a word to help us stay free and he gave us his Spirit to lead us and we need both of them I thank God for that but no matter what Bad Seed we've sown and what mistakes we made and what traps are made Let's be willing to pay the price to go free I pray God by his power will give us the the ability to pay the price to go free and to stay free cuz sometimes it comes at a price but it's so worth it amen it's been good to be here today I've learned a lot amen let's just sing brother Blake will keep me
