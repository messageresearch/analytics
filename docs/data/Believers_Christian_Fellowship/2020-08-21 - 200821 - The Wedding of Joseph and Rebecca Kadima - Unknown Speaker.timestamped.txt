[29:37] nearly beloved we are gathered together
[29:40] in the presence of god
[29:41] to join together this man and woman in
[29:43] holy matrimony
[29:45] it is an honorable estate instituted of
[29:48] god
[29:49] signifying unto us the mystical union
[29:51] that is between christ and his church
[29:54] it is commended in the scripture to be
[29:55] honorable among all
[29:57] and therefore does not by any to be
[29:59] entered into unadvisedly
[30:01] or lightly but reverently discreetly
[30:05] advisedly soberly and in the fear of god
[30:09] and to this holy estate these two
[30:11] persons come now to be joined
[30:14] we have gathered as family and friends
[30:15] of this man and this woman
[30:17] to lend our support and goodwill to this
[30:20] holy union
[30:22] who will now give this woman to be
[30:24] married to this man
[30:28] you can all be seated please
[31:02] okay
[31:46] joseph benjamin will you take rebecca at
[31:47] kadima to be your wedded wife
[31:49] to live together after god's ordinance

[32:09] rebecca kadima will you take joseph

[32:26] so long as you both shall live
[32:29] all right let's all bow our heads and
[32:31] pray
[32:33] dear lord jesus we come to you father in
[32:36] thanksgiving for this day
[32:39] lord you before the foundation of the
[32:41] world had declared that this moment this
[32:42] would take place
[32:43] and we are just yielding to your will
[32:47] now as we've declared the intent and
[32:49] purpose for which we've gathered
[32:50] we as family and friends and guests have
[32:53] gathered to lend our support
[32:55] to this holy union we pray now god you
[32:58] would bless this ceremony
[32:59] and all the symbology that's involved
[33:01] may you be glorified
[33:03] and we bring honor into your name in
[33:05] jesus christ's name we pray
[33:08] amen and
[33:10] friends a wedding is more
[33:13] for christians than just uh adjoining of
[33:17] two people it's a symbolism of the
[33:20] meaning and purpose of the entire bible
[33:23] the whole plan of god has unfolded in
[33:26] the union of christ and his bride so for
[33:30] us
[33:30] this event is is exciting it's it's
[33:33] enjoyable it's fun
[33:35] to see our brother joseph and her sister
[33:37] rebecca come together under god's plan
[33:39] and god's perfect time and
[33:41] his will being fulfilled in their lives
[33:43] but as they stand here being joined
[33:45] together it reminds us
[33:47] of the scriptures it reminds us of the
[33:49] purpose and intent of god
[33:51] in marriage for it was god who
[33:53] instituted the first marriage
[33:55] before there was a church there was
[33:57] marriage
[33:58] before there was houses of worship there
[34:00] was marriage before there was
[34:01] forms in order to worship there was
[34:03] marriage before preachers
[34:05] marriage before schools marriage before
[34:08] anything there was marriage
[34:10] so what do you think is the most
[34:11] important to god
[34:13] amen i'd like to read out of genesis
[34:16] chapter 1 verse 26
[34:18] and god said let us make man in our
[34:20] image after our likeness
[34:22] and let them have dominion over the fish
[34:23] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[34:25] and over the cattle and over all the
[34:27] earth and over every creeping thing
[34:29] that creepeth upon the earth so god
[34:32] created man in his own image in the
[34:33] image of god created he him
[34:35] male and female created he them and god
[34:38] blessed them and god said unto them be
[34:40] fruitful
[34:41] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[34:44] subdue it and have dominion over the
[34:45] fish of the sea
[34:46] and over the fowl of the air and over
[34:49] every living thing that moveth upon the
[34:50] earth
[34:52] and again he says in genesis 5 1 this is
[34:54] the book of the generations of adam
[34:57] and the day that god created man in the
[34:59] likeness of god made he him male and
[35:02] female created he them
[35:04] and blessed them and called their name
[35:06] adam
[35:07] in the day when they were created god
[35:10] declares here
[35:11] that he made man in his own image but
[35:14] the next line says male and female
[35:16] created he them
[35:17] so now we get a picture of the image of
[35:19] god the image of god
[35:21] was expressed in male and female
[35:24] and when god had made male he made the
[35:27] adam
[35:28] within adam was his bride amen and
[35:31] we see just like within christ we were
[35:33] in christ
[35:34] but at the point in time for adam's wife
[35:37] to come forth for his bride
[35:40] god had to lay him down put him to sleep
[35:42] and he had to wound him in the side and
[35:44] take from his side
[35:46] what he would use to form his bride and
[35:48] unite the two back together
[35:50] showing clearly what god was going to do
[35:52] in the future when he would take his son
[35:54] and he would wound him in the side
[35:55] he'd lay him to sleep and take something
[35:57] from him and out of that he would build
[36:00] a bride
[36:00] and present that bride that wife back to
[36:03] his son
[36:05] this in the scriptures in acts chapter
[36:08] 15 verse 18 he says known unto god
[36:11] are all his works from the beginning of
[36:13] the world
[36:14] so god is not figuring out what he'll do
[36:16] next
[36:17] known to god or all his works from the
[36:19] beginning of the world so when god
[36:21] began to do something he knew where he
[36:23] was going to go
[36:24] he knew what his intention was he knew
[36:26] where he was going to get to at the end
[36:28] of time
[36:29] and everything god's been doing has been
[36:31] building to get to the purpose
[36:33] that he purposed in all things isaiah
[36:36] explains it this way in chapter 46
[36:39] remember the former things of old for i
[36:41] am god
[36:42] and there's none else i am god and
[36:44] there's none like me
[36:45] declaring the end from the beginning
[36:49] so god was declaring the end from the
[36:51] beginning
[36:52] so what he did in the beginning will
[36:54] declare what he intends to do
[36:56] in the end declaring the end from the
[36:58] beginning and from ancient times
[37:01] the things that are not yet done saying
[37:04] my counsel shall stand
[37:05] and i will do all my pleasure. so if we
[37:08] want to know what god will do
[37:10] let's look at what he did in the
[37:12] beginning because he declared the end
[37:14] from the beginning and
[37:18] even jesus he's asked a question about
[37:20] marriage
[37:21] and it's a question concerning divorce
[37:23] and when jesus answers the question he's
[37:25] got to point them to the right place so
[37:27] they'll understand
[37:28] the answer to the question and they
[37:31] asked him and
[37:32] then jesus responds says the pharisees
[37:34] also came to him tempting
[37:36] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[37:38] a man to put away his wife for every
[37:40] cause
[37:40] and he answered and said unto them have
[37:42] you not read that he which made them
[37:44] at the beginning made them male and
[37:46] female and said for this
[37:48] cause shall a man leave father and
[37:50] mother and shall cleave to his wife
[37:52] and they twain shall be one flesh
[37:55] wherefore they are no more twain but one
[37:57] flesh
[37:58] what therefore god hath joined together
[38:00] let no man put a sun
[38:01] there so when jesus answers the question
[38:05] jesus has to take him back to the
[38:07] beginning because if you understand the
[38:09] beginning you understand what god will
[38:11] do
[38:11] what he wanted to do what he has done is
[38:14] what he'll do again
[38:15] and the answer lies in the beginning
[38:18] what will god do next what is god's
[38:20] purpose what's his plan what's the whole
[38:22] bible about
[38:23] he declared the end from the beginning
[38:25] and everything in between is telling the
[38:27] same story it's god
[38:29] building to his grand conclusion because
[38:31] known unto him are his works
[38:33] from the beginning of the world you're
[38:36] standing here
[38:37] not not just to fulfill your own desire
[38:41] this is part of the plan of god you're
[38:43] here on this date at this time
[38:45] to declare unto us god's original
[38:47] purpose
[38:48] you here today are showing what he's
[38:50] done and you here today are showing what
[38:53] he will do
[38:54] for god's plan was always to have a son
[38:58] and for that son to have a bride and for
[39:00] them to be united together
[39:02] and be placed in a perfect place on the
[39:04] earth to live in harmony
[39:06] in love to display the very nature of
[39:08] god
[39:09] and you today are reminding us of that
[39:11] great purpose
[39:14] god when he had that when jesus christ
[39:17] was here god in flesh he had to answer
[39:19] the question
[39:20] and to answer the question he put him
[39:21] back in the beginning
[39:23] and so god at the end of time has sent
[39:24] us a great prophet and that prophet also
[39:26] took us back to the beginning
[39:28] so we would understand so we'd have no
[39:30] misunderstanding
[39:32] and that prophet of god said this and if
[39:34] you will
[39:35] if you'll notice how that eve was united
[39:36] with adam she became part of him
[39:39] god did you notice in genesis 1 27 he
[39:42] created
[39:43] male men male and female created thee
[39:45] them
[39:46] now the man was both male and female
[39:49] when it came to being in the spirit of
[39:51] feminist and masculine
[39:52] then god took from his side a rib did
[39:54] you notice the body part
[39:56] was a byproduct but not the spirit the
[39:58] body part of the woman was a byproduct
[40:00] after the creation had been finished
[40:02] god took from the side of adam a rib and
[40:05] made a woman
[40:06] but not the spirit the spirit was part
[40:08] of adam for he was both male
[40:10] and man and woman spiritually speaking
[40:13] both masculine
[40:14] and finished so when god was looking for
[40:18] a
[40:18] wife for adam the solution to his
[40:22] problem was found in adam
[40:24] and when god is looking for a bride for
[40:26] christ the solution is
[40:28] already in christ genesis 2 we'll go
[40:32] back to genesis 2 and we'll read to this
[40:34] account
[40:36] genesis 2 and 18 and the lord god said
[40:38] it is not good that man shall be alone
[40:41] i will make him a help meet for him
[40:44] if you look at this word help me it's
[40:46] more than just a helper
[40:48] it's a help meet and this word meet in
[40:50] the original means
[40:51] suitable a suitable help not just a help
[40:55] but a suitable help on this suitable
[40:57] help means one that
[40:58] is like so in order to be a suitable
[41:01] help she had to be like adam
[41:03] so let's read the rest of the story and
[41:05] out of the ground the lord god formed
[41:07] every beast of the field and every fowl
[41:09] of the air
[41:10] and brought them unto adam to see what
[41:12] he would call them
[41:13] and whatsoever adam called every living
[41:15] creature that was the name thereof
[41:18] and adam gave names to all cattle and to
[41:20] the fowl of the air and to every beast
[41:22] of the field
[41:23] but for adam there was not found a help
[41:26] meet
[41:27] a suitable help
[41:30] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[41:32] fall upon adam and he slept and he took
[41:33] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[41:35] instead thereof
[41:37] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[41:38] from man made he a woman
[41:40] and brought her unto the man and adam
[41:43] said this is now bone of my bones
[41:45] flesh of my flesh she shall be called
[41:47] woman because she was taken out of man
[41:50] therefore shall a man leave his father
[41:51] and his mother shall cleave unto his
[41:53] wife
[41:54] and they shall be one flesh
[41:57] and the day god created them he created
[41:59] man in his own image
[42:01] male and female created he them and
[42:03] called their name
[42:05] adam they only had one name
[42:08] because they were really two opposite
[42:10] reflections of one person
[42:12] it was adam male and female god was
[42:15] showing from the beginning
[42:17] what he would do in the end because in
[42:19] the end there's going to be one christ
[42:22] male and female one jesus christ and his
[42:24] bride
[42:25] a mini-membrane body prophet of god says
[42:28] this
[42:30] he said hatred had a beginning so it has
[42:33] to have an end
[42:34] love had no beginning so it has no end
[42:38] hatred is forever love is eternal
[42:42] hatred begins and hatred will end love
[42:44] never did begin
[42:45] and it never will end see it's eternal
[42:49] and when a man loves a woman and marries
[42:51] her because she's just pretty
[42:53] there'll be an end to that but when a
[42:56] man finds a woman that he loves he don't
[42:58] know why but he loves her
[43:00] and she finds the man she loves no
[43:01] matter what he looks like he loves her
[43:03] she loves him that's an eternal mate in
[43:06] glory
[43:07] death nor nothing else can ever separate
[43:10] them
[43:11] because they are from eternity and they
[43:13] stepped out into space of time and will
[43:15] return
[43:15] back to eternity eternity has dropped in
[43:18] a body called time then it goes right
[43:20] back
[43:20] up into eternity again it cannot perish
[43:26] so if you love him and you can't really
[43:28] explain why
[43:30] and if you love her and you can't really
[43:32] explain why
[43:34] you may have tried to use words but the
[43:35] words somehow were never fitting to the
[43:37] feeling
[43:38] the feeling runs deeper you guys are not
[43:40] here just because of
[43:42] your own desire you're not here just
[43:44] because of your own
[43:45] purpose or for your own pleasure but
[43:47] there's something else if you're a child
[43:49] of god
[43:49] there's something else moving you
[43:51] motivating you there's a love that's
[43:53] hard to express a love that's hard to
[43:55] explain
[43:56] because that love came from the eternal
[43:58] and is eternal
[43:59] it will never die that's what your
[44:02] marriage is based on the eternal
[44:04] purpose of god not the temporal
[44:08] plans and purposes and desires of a man
[44:11] and woman but the eternal purpose of god
[44:14] you today are showing us what took place
[44:17] in the garden
[44:18] but you're showing us more than that
[44:20] you're showing us what's taking place
[44:22] now in the day we live
[44:23] as christ is uniting with his bride in
[44:26] an invisible union
[44:28] and all of that invisible union will be
[44:29] made manifest one day upon this earth
[44:32] when christ takes the throne of his
[44:34] father david
[44:35] and rules and reigns and we as his bride
[44:38] are on earth with him restored back to
[44:40] eden
[44:42] see from the beginning he declared the
[44:46] end
[44:47] god knew when he made adam and eve he
[44:49] knew what what his objective was he knew
[44:51] what his goal was
[44:52] when he wrote the old testament he knew
[44:54] christ was coming and christ was the
[44:56] fulfillment of all the prophecies
[44:58] when he allowed the new testament to
[44:59] roll on through seven church ages he
[45:01] knew what was coming
[45:02] god wasn't taking in surprise he wasn't
[45:04] adding to his knowledge
[45:05] he wasn't changing his ideas with time
[45:08] he knew exactly where he was getting to
[45:11] and he was getting to that grand union
[45:12] of christ and his bride
[45:14] and back on the earth again we read from
[45:17] the beginning of the book
[45:19] in genesis what god's original intent
[45:21] what he did in the beginning
[45:22] now let's read a couple scriptures from
[45:24] the end of the book from book revelation
[45:26] from the book of revelations
[45:28] and we will all see that he declared the
[45:30] end
[45:31] from the beginning because the book of
[45:33] revelation ends
[45:34] in the last couple of chapters
[45:36] revelation 19
[45:38] 6 says and i heard as it were the voice
[45:40] of a great multitude
[45:42] and as the voice of many waters and as
[45:44] the voice of mighty thundering saying
[45:45] alleluia
[45:46] for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let
[45:49] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[45:51] him
[45:52] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[45:54] and his wife
[45:55] hath made herself ready then again in
[45:58] revelations 21
[45:59] 9 and there came unto me one of the
[46:01] seven angels which had the seven
[46:03] vials full of the seven last plagues and
[46:06] talked with me saying come hither
[46:07] i will show thee the bride the lamb's
[46:10] wife
[46:11] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[46:12] a great and high mountain and showed me
[46:14] that great city
[46:15] the holy jerusalem descending out of
[46:18] heaven
[46:18] from god this is how the story finishes
[46:23] it was declared from how the story began
[46:27] god will have a bride for the lamb
[46:31] if the lamb has to have a bride like
[46:33] adam had to have a bride
[46:35] what kind of bride did adam have he had
[46:38] to have a
[46:38] suitable bride or one that was like in
[46:41] and had to come from him
[46:43] if the lamb will have a bride he also
[46:45] must have a suitable bride
[46:47] so if there's going to be a mr lamb
[46:49] there has to be a mrs lamb
[46:51] there's a mister christ there have to be
[46:53] a mrs christ
[46:55] right he declared the end from the
[46:58] beginning
[46:59] so i charge you both brother joseph
[47:02] sister rebecca
[47:03] i charge you to keep the image pure to
[47:06] labor and strive
[47:07] to not let the antichrist spirit come in
