[0:14] oh
[0:23] [Music]
[0:47] consider my servant
[0:54] consider my little
[1:00] righteous in all of her
[1:03] ways leaning
[1:07] believing in the sacrifice
[1:12] no matter what evil be tights
[1:15] no matter what anyone says
[1:18] she shall never let go of
[1:21] the truth i
[1:26] know the way that she takes
[1:30] her life is in my hands
[1:33] i know the end from the beginning
[1:39] and no matter what the trials
[1:43] no matter what comes her way
[1:46] she shall come
[1:49] forth as gold
[1:54] [Music]
[2:06] in his mind from before
[2:12] time even began
[2:16] he foresaw my
[2:19] whole life
[2:23] he knew the choices
[2:26] that i would make so i don't
[2:30] need to worry and i don't need to
[2:34] fret for he knows he sees and he
[2:40] cares
[2:42] he knows the way that i take
[2:47] my life is in his hands
[2:50] he knows the end from the
[2:53] beginning and no matter what the trials
[2:59] no matter what comes my way i shall
[3:04] come forth
[3:19] he told me who i
[3:23] am and that i
[3:26] belong to him
[3:30] so no matter what the trials
[3:36] he said my bride shall come
[3:39] forth as gold
[3:46] [Music]
[3:49] he knows the way that i take
[3:54] my life is in his hands he knows the
[4:02] and no matter what the trials
[4:05] no matter what comes my way i shall
[4:11] come forth as gold
[4:17] yes i shall come forth
[4:22] as gold
[4:33] and
[4:36] you are
[4:40] so praying
[4:43] [Laughter]
[4:49] [Music]
[4:57] to me
[5:25] and here i am
[5:41] [Laughter]
[5:44] [Applause]
[5:44] [Music]
[5:50] oh
[5:55] [Laughter]
[6:04] yesterday
[6:17] lord here i am
[6:39] [Music]
[6:56] here i am again
[7:07] [Music]
[7:09] praise the lord it's good to worship the
[7:12] lord
[7:13] man certainly good to be with you today
[7:15] we counted a great privilege and an
[7:17] honor
[7:18] amen we're going to ask you to be seated
[7:20] for just a minute
[7:21] i just got a couple quick announcements
[7:26] uh we're going to do something a little
[7:27] bit different at the end of service
[7:29] today and we're going to
[7:30] the the deacons will open the door at
[7:33] the end of service but we're going to
[7:34] allow you to dismiss yourself at the end
[7:35] of service like we did before
[7:37] instead of the deacons dismissing row by
[7:39] row we've had some time now to get
[7:41] accustomed to the way things work and
[7:43] everybody's got an
[7:44] understanding of the way stuff works so
[7:46] just be conscious when you're leaving
[7:48] that we don't get plugged up anywhere
[7:50] along the way but as we're worshiping at
[7:52] the end and
[7:53] and we're dismissed you can dismiss as
[7:55] you feel to go amen
[7:57] we felt like there was just you know too
[8:00] much restricted worship at the end
[8:02] and now everybody understands what to do
[8:04] we can dismiss as we'd like to dismiss
[8:06] so
[8:06] once you dismiss just be conscious of
[8:08] that the one thing we'd like for you to
[8:10] remain
[8:10] uh careful of is to just pass quickly
[8:13] through the four year out into the
[8:14] parking lot because the doors will be
[8:16] open
[8:16] and people will be inside worshiping and
[8:18] praying and we need to keep it very
[8:19] quiet
[8:20] and that's coming in and going out
[8:22] everybody knows how to come in
[8:24] we all know how to set ourselves seat
[8:26] ourselves now we know
[8:27] the arrangement we know how we need to
[8:29] leave but coming in we got to remember
[8:31] to be quiet too because the doors are
[8:33] open and people are inside praying
[8:34] before service
[8:35] so we must keep it really quiet so just
[8:37] pass quickly through the foyer to your
[8:39] seats
[8:40] leaving's the same way when we're
[8:41] dismissed you can leave at your
[8:43] discretion
[8:44] when you feel that you're ready to go
[8:46] after you worship you can stay in
[8:47] worship you can go
[8:48] however you need to go but just be
[8:50] conscious just just be aware
[8:52] as you leave so that's going to be a
[8:54] change also
[8:55] we're going to start before service
[8:57] unlocking the two doors down here by the
[8:59] east parking lot
[9:00] so it's easier to get in especially if
[9:02] it'd be a light rain or something like
[9:03] that
[9:04] you can come in that way and then you
[9:07] know they'll be locked during the
[9:08] service but they'll be unlocked before
[9:10] so those are a couple changes also
[9:13] i wanted to give a congratulations to
[9:15] our graduates this year
[9:17] this is a strange year to graduate
[9:20] no ceremonies so far no open houses
[9:24] nothing like that but but uh our high
[9:26] school graduates
[9:28] are brook lamb sam pitzenberger emily
[9:31] sam martin
[9:31] and joshua small amen let's just let's
[9:34] give them a round of applause and say
[9:35] congratulations
[9:42] this has been strange times some of them
[9:45] had
[9:45] virtual graduations and all kinds of
[9:48] different things and
[9:49] i know many of them maybe all four of
[9:51] them will have some sort of open house
[9:52] later
[9:53] in the summer as things get a little bit
[9:54] easier so we'll announce that
[9:56] as those come up and then we have three
[9:58] college graduates
[10:00] abigail mcnulty blake lamb and emily
[10:02] preston so i'm going to congratulate
[10:04] them as well
[10:11] so you guys all graduated during the
[10:14] great pandemic of 2020.
[10:17] you'll never forget it amen praise the
[10:19] lord so
[10:20] it was odd and it was unusual we don't
[10:22] want to miss the chance to say
[10:23] congratulations god bless you all
[10:26] and may he continue to bless you all
[10:29] also i want to give a special thank you
[10:31] to brother rich levy he came in friday
[10:33] and he took apart the overhead
[10:35] projectors he's been working on for a
[10:36] little while
[10:37] took him apart cleaned them and cleared
[10:38] up everything so we have very clear
[10:40] overhead projection now
[10:42] so god bless you brother rich and thank
[10:44] you very much
[10:45] amen it's nice to have technicians
[10:48] people know how to work on lab equipment
[10:49] amen
[10:50] i guess it translates to overhead
[10:52] projectors too
[10:53] so we're blessed and we thank god for
[10:55] that all right let's stand and we'll get
[10:57] right into the word
[11:01] amen i've got a lot of things that i
[11:03] want to share and i don't know how
[11:05] i feel like this is the this is the way
[11:08] it's been for me for quite some time
[11:10] it's always too much never too little in
[11:13] the the
[11:14] vessel that god chooses to use is very
[11:15] inadequate and incapable
[11:18] and but we have faith in his way not in
[11:20] our ability
[11:21] so i just pray that you would stay with
[11:23] me and pull on the gift
[11:24] amen let god do what he wants to do and
[11:27] say what he wants to say
[11:28] i don't even really know you know myself
[11:31] how things will go together there's a
[11:32] lot of information a lot of material a
[11:34] lot of things on my heart
[11:35] that i want to share but we're just
[11:36] trusting in the lord to bring out what's
[11:38] important amen
[11:39] what matters most let's look in the book
[11:41] of revelation together
[11:44] revelation chapter 1. i realized
[11:47] wednesday i said genesis 1 then went to
[11:49] revelations 1.
[11:51] i saw everybody laughing and turning
[11:53] their bibles but i thought i'm not even
[11:54] going to address it
[11:57] we'll just keep moving amen brother ben
[12:01] said take me for what i mean not for
[12:02] what i say
[12:04] you guys know me we know you we love one
[12:06] another anyhow
[12:07] that's real love when you love one
[12:09] another anyhow
[12:11] praise be to god revelation 1 1
[12:15] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[12:17] gave unto him
[12:18] to show into his servants things which
[12:21] much
[12:22] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[12:24] signified it by his angel and to his
[12:26] servant john
[12:27] who bear record of the word of god in
[12:29] the testimony of jesus christ and of all
[12:31] things that he saw
[12:33] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[12:34] hear the words of this prophecy
[12:36] and keep those things which are written
[12:38] therein for the time is at hand
[12:40] how many can say amen for the time is at
[12:44] hand
[12:44] amen more so than ever before let's just
[12:47] bow our heads and pray
[12:49] lord jesus we thank you for this word we
[12:52] thank you god for the privilege of being
[12:54] able to gather into this place today
[12:56] of being able lord to worship you in
[12:58] spirit and in truth
[13:00] we thank you god that we have bibles
[13:02] lord in print that we can read them in
[13:03] our own language
[13:04] and we've got a message lord and audio
[13:07] and we've got an in text lord and you've
[13:08] given us so much
[13:10] but go to all of that all that you've
[13:13] given us
[13:14] it won't work unless you come and make
[13:16] it work yourself by divine revelation
[13:19] we need we need you lord to come and
[13:21] turn the key in our heart lord to give
[13:23] us the revelation of the word
[13:25] that we might see what you're trying to
[13:27] share with your bride in this hour
[13:29] what your prophet brought what he was
[13:30] trying to get the bride to see
[13:32] open our eyes that we might see it lord
[13:34] give us that eye salve that we might see
[13:37] the word the way
[13:38] you see the word lord the way you want
[13:40] us to see it in the hour that we live
[13:42] i pray to take control and have
[13:43] preeminence on everything that's said
[13:45] and everything that's done
[13:47] bless the speaker bless to hear help us
[13:49] to receive your word
[13:51] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[13:55] you can be seated and we'll turn to the
[13:57] book of ecclesiastes
[13:59] together i want to preach on the sixth
[14:01] seal
[14:04] and so i just titled it the sixth seal
[14:07] but i just there's some things that i
[14:08] want to look at and try in line with
[14:10] what we've been looking at through the
[14:11] book of revelation
[14:12] and some of the things the prophet has
[14:14] shared with us and
[14:16] i just want to take a look at it from
[14:17] this angle and and just
[14:19] focusing just on the sixth seal if we
[14:21] can
[14:23] exodus or i'm sorry ecclesiastes
[14:26] one and nine ecclesiastes 1
[14:32] and 9 the thing that hath been
[14:36] it is that which shall be and that which
[14:39] is done
[14:39] is that which shall be done and there is
[14:42] no new thing under the sun
[14:44] is there anything more of it may be said
[14:46] see this is new
[14:48] it has been already of old time which
[14:50] was before us
[14:52] solomon lays down a really good
[14:54] principle here
[14:55] amen this is not new amen this has been
[14:58] before
[14:59] even the spiritual battle we find
[15:01] ourselves in between two opposing forces
[15:03] the antichrist spirit and the spirit of
[15:04] christ
[15:04] it's an old battle that started way in
[15:06] heaven it's not new
[15:08] so these things that are happened have
[15:09] happened before and brother braham says
[15:11] in the message i will restore
[15:13] 1954 now all these things that we see
[15:16] happen today
[15:17] is nothing on the earth that is new
[15:19] everything has been before
[15:21] and if you'll notice the day that we're
[15:23] living in different days of cultanisms
[15:25] and so forth
[15:26] those things are not new they've always
[15:28] been
[15:29] they've been in different forms so
[15:31] whatever we're facing whatever we're
[15:33] finding it's been here before
[15:34] brother baby said spirits don't die amen
[15:37] they just continue on they just change
[15:38] places so whatever spirit was here
[15:41] amen in the book of genesis is the same
[15:43] spirit that's here
[15:44] amen in the book of revelation now he
[15:47] says in the message handwriting on the
[15:49] wall
[15:50] but now while we're speaking on this it
[15:52] come on my heart
[15:53] that this would be a very unusual but a
[15:55] timely message for the people
[15:57] and now any bible reader here knows that
[15:59] all scripture has a compound meaning
[16:02] every prophecy some most all of it a
[16:04] duel a time there or two times
[16:06] or more so the same scripture that
[16:09] that brother bam is now showing us the
[16:11] same scripture in prophecy
[16:13] can happen one time two times dual
[16:15] meaning two times
[16:16] or more he's not limiting the use of
[16:19] scripture
[16:20] because the scripture is eternal the
[16:22] word is eternal
[16:24] and all these things have been before
[16:26] and shall be again
[16:28] so he's not brother is not limiting the
[16:30] scripture one of the huge
[16:32] problems that we've done with with a
[16:33] human mind and denominationalism is
[16:36] we've limited the scripture
[16:38] and we've pigeonholed the scripture that
[16:40] this means
[16:41] that and we put it in this whole and we
[16:43] won't let that scripture
[16:45] mean anything else right
[16:48] and so and so now what brother branham
[16:52] was really good at doing is he was good
[16:54] at really messing up our denominational
[16:56] understanding because he'd take the same
[16:57] scripture and he put it in this hole in
[16:59] this whole and that hole over there
[17:01] and you're like well which one's the
[17:02] truth you don't have to pick which one's
[17:05] true
[17:05] amen they're all true because what he's
[17:07] doing is finding the same scenario
[17:09] playing out
[17:10] with the same spirits and he's grabbing
[17:12] the same scripture
[17:13] and he's applying it the same way to the
[17:15] same scenario
[17:16] in another form so the word is eternal
[17:20] and we
[17:21] we we got to get away from the idea of
[17:24] this
[17:24] is already interpreted and put in here
[17:27] and this is already interpreted and put
[17:28] in here
[17:29] because if you do that with the prophet
[17:30] of god you're going to run into some
[17:32] major problems
[17:33] because the prophet of god will use the
[17:35] same scripture two different ways
[17:37] and two different seemingly applications
[17:39] and then
[17:40] then if we have to pigeonhole it and we
[17:42] have to define it then we're going to
[17:43] have to decide which one's true and
[17:45] which one's not
[17:48] but i think that's a foolish way to look
[17:50] at the message for a human mind
[17:52] to try to determine which one well
[17:54] brother he said this one last
[17:56] and then he said this one more times
[18:00] because he said this more times or he
[18:02] said this this the last time he used
[18:04] this
[18:04] quote and he said it this way oh we're
[18:06] going to get in big trouble doing that
[18:09] just let the prophet be the prophet just
[18:11] let him use the word he's the one gifted
[18:13] to do it and let him place out the
[18:15] scriptures
[18:15] and just say how can they both be true i
[18:18] don't know but they're both true
[18:21] and if we can take that attitude and
[18:23] look at the scripture that way
[18:24] all of a sudden many things begin to
[18:27] unlock
[18:28] because we haven't locked ourselves down
[18:30] to a carnal understanding
[18:33] see we know by time space and matter
[18:39] we understand things i've used this
[18:43] analogy before
[18:44] but we say this is here
[18:48] right this is just how we live our human
[18:51] life
[18:51] this is there and now
[18:55] i move this from here to there now it's
[18:57] there
[18:59] and for us humans this can't be here
[19:02] and there at the same time
[19:06] is that right we're limited by time
[19:09] space and matter
[19:10] it can't be here and there at the same
[19:12] time
[19:13] but god is not limited by those laws
[19:16] god can be here and there at the same
[19:18] time because jesus christ can be the son
[19:21] of man
[19:21] that's come on earth who's now in heaven
[19:24] and he can talk about you
[19:26] and say that you're now seated in
[19:27] heavenly places in christ jesus
[19:29] but standing on the earth so you can
[19:31] have the same application that jesus
[19:33] christ did when he was on earth
[19:35] speaking to them and he's saying now you
[19:37] know this is going to blow your mind but
[19:39] i'm here but i'm there
[19:41] i'm come here but i'm there and he looks
[19:43] at you amen in the scriptures and says
[19:45] you're here but you're also there
[19:48] but we would say i'm either here or
[19:50] there or i'm here now and later
[19:52] i'll be there later what's later mean to
[19:54] god later means nothing to god
[19:56] everything is now to god you're here and
[19:59] there
[20:01] you're like brother ted what are you
[20:02] talking about i don't even know because
[20:04] i've lived in this dimension all of my
[20:05] life
[20:06] all of my human life amen but i've got
[20:08] some part of me
[20:09] amen that was not bound by these laws
[20:12] there's something down in my soul
[20:14] an attribute of god amen that was in god
[20:17] before he created the laws of the
[20:19] universe the natural laws
[20:20] and there's a part of me that's not
[20:22] bound by the natural laws
[20:24] so that i can say i am now seated in
[20:26] heavenly places
[20:28] in christ jesus and i am now standing
[20:30] with my feet upon the earth and there's
[20:32] no
[20:33] problem in my heart
[20:37] you see there's got to be we've got to
[20:39] free ourselves from the limitations of
[20:41] carnality
[20:42] and be spiritual minded people
[20:45] and so brother madam i mean he just he
[20:48] does like every other prophet
[20:50] he totally destroys your thinking
[20:53] thank god for the destruction and the
[20:56] tear down
[20:57] of my carnal thinking
[21:00] amen so we want to make sure that
[21:04] that we don't pigeonhole anything we
[21:07] look at these things coming through a
[21:08] revolving history
[21:10] a one time a dual time or more times
[21:13] a spiritual application in a natural
[21:15] application
[21:16] or how about this a natural application
[21:19] that turns to a spiritual application
[21:20] that goes back to a natural application
[21:25] is in the bible it's there
[21:28] but i thought once it we'll know it's
[21:30] just natural and spiritual so it goes
[21:31] natural to spiritual and it's done
[21:33] no sometimes it goes natural spiritual
[21:35] back to natural
[21:37] natural israel spiritual church back to
[21:39] natural 144 000 israel
[21:42] and the prophecy moves right along boom
[21:44] boom
[21:45] seed of abraham praise be to god
[21:51] amen i love the word
[21:54] now i'm gonna look at a quote of the
[21:57] seventh seal brother bram says now
[21:58] the eighth chapter only reveals the
[22:00] scene of the seventh seal
[22:02] where nothing else is revealed now
[22:04] nothing is not revealed in the seventh
[22:06] seal i say that quote and i smiled every
[22:08] time
[22:08] i love it nothing is not revealed on the
[22:10] seventh seal that means there's
[22:11] something revealed it's just not told
[22:14] nothing is not revealed in the seventh
[22:16] seal now has nothing to do with the
[22:18] seventh chapter of revelation it's the
[22:20] revealing of the seventh seal is
[22:21] perfectly mute and if it only had
[22:24] time i'll try a few places to show you
[22:26] all the way back from genesis
[22:28] this seventh chapter this seventh seal
[22:31] is spoke of
[22:32] so now this is the seventh seal brother
[22:34] branham said
[22:35] the settlement seal was totally mute
[22:40] nothing's not revealed in the seventh
[22:42] seal
[22:43] it's totally mute nothing's even spoke
[22:46] of it
[22:47] and now he tells you all the way back in
[22:49] genesis the seventh seal spoke of
[22:53] praise be to god just not in the way we
[22:55] were looking for the revelation of the
[22:57] seventh seal
[22:58] but it's laying there amen because the
[23:00] seventh seal is christ
[23:02] it is jesus christ it's the revelation
[23:05] of jesus christ it's the coming of
[23:06] christ
[23:07] it's however where you want a word it's
[23:08] the opening of the word which is christ
[23:11] it's christ amen and all the way back
[23:14] when god
[23:15] first speaks his word he takes his
[23:17] thought and turns it into spoken word
[23:19] and then when he
[23:20] speaks now that becomes the anointed
[23:22] word and the anointed word
[23:24] is christ it is the seventh seal it is
[23:27] christ the mystery of god revealed
[23:30] so where do you have it all the way back
[23:32] in genesis in the beginning
[23:35] there you go all the way through
[23:38] now he says now to show you all the way
[23:40] back
[23:41] from genesis this seventh chapter the
[23:43] seventh seal spoke of
[23:45] from the very beginning in genesis these
[23:48] seals
[23:48] move right up now he's not just talking
[23:51] the seventh seal he's talking all the
[23:53] seals
[23:54] all the way back from genesis these
[23:56] seals move right up
[23:58] why because when he comes to the
[24:00] revelation of the seventh seal it's the
[24:02] revelation
[24:03] that tied together the whole bible when
[24:06] those seals were loosed it loosed the
[24:08] whole bible
[24:09] they said this bible was wrapped with
[24:11] these seven seals
[24:13] so these seven seals loosed loses the
[24:16] whole bible
[24:17] and now you can go back and see those
[24:18] seals coming up all the way back from
[24:21] the book of
[24:22] genesis but if we're now
[24:25] limited limiting ourselves in the
[24:29] scriptures by time
[24:30] space and manner now we say no
[24:33] that the first seal means this
[24:36] it's it's this it's the first church age
[24:39] it's when the nicolaitan spirit began
[24:41] and it means that and nothing more are
[24:45] you kidding
[24:45] do you think that the white horse wasn't
[24:47] writing in genesis
[24:49] do you think deception didn't come
[24:51] looking in a religious form when cain
[24:53] was brilliant
[24:54] cain was hey cain was coming under the
[24:57] first seal
[24:58] amen under a religious deception
[25:01] nimrod was coming amen in the first seal
[25:05] under a religious deception amen no no
[25:07] it only means this
[25:08] because it was revealed at the end time
[25:10] and in late means this brother bannon
[25:11] says those seals
[25:13] unlocked the whole bible and they've
[25:15] been coming up from genesis
[25:16] that you can see the white horse rider
[25:18] has been writing since there were men
[25:20] upon the earth
[25:21] amen there was a serpent that came in
[25:23] amen that was looked like human but
[25:25] wasn't human
[25:28] so close but not the same thing
[25:33] and he brought a deception by the word
[25:38] amen praise be to god the seals are
[25:41] coming right up
[25:44] so once once we're once we're allowed to
[25:47] believe that
[25:48] the bible gets so much more fun to read
[25:52] because the seals unlock the bible
[25:55] let's go to the sixth seal revelation
[25:58] chapter six
[26:08] together
[26:16] revelation chapter 6
[26:21] verse 12.
[26:28] and i beheld when he had opened the
[26:29] sixth seal and low there was a great
[26:31] earthquake
[26:32] and the sun became black a sackcloth of
[26:34] hair and the moon became his blood
[26:37] and the stars of heaven fell into the
[26:39] earth even as a fig tree casteth their
[26:41] untimely figs when she is shaken of a
[26:43] mighty wind
[26:45] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[26:46] it is rolled together and every mountain
[26:48] and island were moved out of their
[26:49] places
[26:50] and the kings of the earth and the great
[26:52] men and the rich men and the chief
[26:54] captains and the mighty men
[26:56] and every bondman and every freeman hid
[26:58] themselves in the dens and the rocks of
[27:00] the mountains
[27:01] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[27:03] on us and hide us from the face of him
[27:05] that sitteth on the throne from the
[27:07] wrath of the lamb for the great day of
[27:09] his wrath has come
[27:10] and who shall be able to stand praise
[27:13] god
[27:15] brother bam says in the sixth seal he
[27:17] says this paragraph 144 he says
[27:19] we know that the sixth seal is the
[27:22] judgment seal
[27:23] so now he's bringing it right down to
[27:25] the sixth seal is the judgment seal
[27:27] it's the mystery in the sixth seal that
[27:29] it's a judgment seal
[27:30] and the number of man is six
[27:34] and man is fallen and therefore must be
[27:36] judged
[27:37] right so the sixth seal is the judgment
[27:40] seal
[27:40] is the judgment meal exactly what it is
[27:43] now notice for the sixth seal is the
[27:45] judgment seal of the word that just
[27:48] opened up a lot
[27:51] it's not just a judgment seal the end
[27:52] time but it's the judgment seal of the
[27:54] word
[27:55] and all the way through it's the
[27:56] judgment seal
[27:58] further and further down in the sixth
[27:59] seal message he says he's fixing to take
[28:01] the 144 000
[28:03] out for redemption out of the book of
[28:05] redemption and that's
[28:06] under the seal of redemption in the
[28:08] sixth seal
[28:09] so now brother baum gives two labels to
[28:11] the sixth seal the sixth seal
[28:13] is the seal of judgment and the sixth
[28:15] seal is the seal of redemption
[28:18] praise be to god because that's where he
[28:20] work does his redemption work is through
[28:22] the six seals
[28:23] and the seventh seal reveals the one
[28:25] who's been doing the redemption work
[28:27] so through the sixth seal his redemption
[28:29] so the sixth seal is the seal of
[28:31] redemption the sixth seal but it's also
[28:33] the seal of judgment
[28:34] let's go to genesis chapter seven
[28:42] genesis chapter 7 and let's look at the
[28:45] very
[28:45] first destruction
[28:48] after the genesis 1 account
[28:52] genesis chapter 7 verse 5.
[28:58] now we know that god comes down and
[29:00] decides that he's got to judge the earth
[29:02] because violence filled the earth man
[29:04] did that which was
[29:05] evil continually and all the desires of
[29:07] his heart he did
[29:08] and god's going to pass a judgment amen
[29:11] but at the time of judgment there's
[29:12] somebody that finds grace in the eyes of
[29:14] the lord
[29:15] and that's noah because noah is the
[29:16] elect seed so
[29:18] now he comes to noah and and it says
[29:21] in verse 5 and noah did according to all
[29:23] that the lord commanded him
[29:25] and noah was 600 years old when the
[29:27] flood of waters was upon the earth
[29:30] six you catch the 600 you find this
[29:33] laying all through the bible
[29:35] the number six is associated with man
[29:37] it's also associated with judgment
[29:39] it also has something to do with
[29:40] redemption
[29:42] because in this flood is coming at the
[29:45] 600th year of noah
[29:47] and at the 600 year of noah you're going
[29:49] to see the earth go into the sixth seal
[29:51] because part of the sixth seal is the
[29:53] destruction of the earth
[29:55] right so as part of the destruction of
[29:57] the earth
[29:58] amen it's it's a purging seal it's a
[30:01] judgment seal it's a purging seal and a
[30:03] destroying seal
[30:04] amen because the 144 thousand are purged
[30:07] under the sixth seal
[30:08] and the foolish virgin are purged under
[30:10] the sixth seal so that means when you
[30:12] come in contact with judgment of god
[30:14] there's two outcomes right
[30:17] when you come in contact with the
[30:19] judgment seal you have two outcomes
[30:21] you're either purged or you're destroyed
[30:24] there's nothing in between
[30:26] and i say god let that sixth seal when i
[30:29] come in contact with it
[30:30] let it purge me god let me be purged
[30:33] when i come in contact with that sixth
[30:34] seal
[30:35] and i recognize i'm wrong amen may i
[30:38] find grace in your eyes and be purged
[30:41] not destroyed so now under the judgment
[30:44] seal and noah's 600 year
[30:46] there's going to be a judgment of flood
[30:47] that's going to destroy the earth and
[30:49] destroy the inhabitants of the earth
[30:50] but it's also a seal of redemption
[30:54] because there's going to be eight souls
[30:55] that are going to be redeemed off the
[30:56] earth
[30:58] through the ark so at the same time
[31:00] judgment striking
[31:01] there's also redemption taking place
[31:05] this earth is going to be judged the
[31:07] world is judged
[31:08] there's a judgment coming because of the
[31:10] fall of humanity because what happened
[31:12] in the garden of eden
[31:13] there's been a judgment cycle coming but
[31:15] through the judgment
[31:16] there's there's those that find grace in
[31:19] the eyes of the lord
[31:20] and they're purged through the judgment
[31:22] seal
[31:23] and they come out purged and they come
[31:26] out redeemed
[31:27] and that's the position that i want to
[31:29] hold brother bam says in the sixth seal
[31:33] so now remember we've seen jesus saw it
[31:36] that's right jesus saw it and now we
[31:38] find others saw it
[31:40] we find it typed out in jacob he's
[31:42] referring to the sixth seal
[31:43] we find it typed out in jacob we find it
[31:46] typed in
[31:46] egypt we see it typed out at the cross
[31:50] so now brother i'm showing you there's a
[31:52] sixth seal type
[31:53] in jacob there's a six seal type in
[31:55] egypt and there's a sixth seal type
[31:57] at the cross and so this
[32:01] these seals have been coming right up do
[32:04] you believe that
[32:05] these seals have been coming right up we
[32:06] see the six seal and jacob under jacob's
[32:09] trouble
[32:09] amen when he starts to have tension we
[32:11] talked about this before
[32:12] he comes under tension with laban's sons
[32:15] because he's got a money-making scheme
[32:16] because he's a shyster
[32:18] brother said he's a money grabber i
[32:21] didn't say it brother branham said it
[32:23] he said the jews always been that way
[32:25] and i i'm not saying that
[32:29] brother bram said he's a shyster he's a
[32:31] money grabber amen he'll get it anyway
[32:33] and cheat you any way to get it
[32:35] and here comes jacob to scheister he
[32:37] cheated for the birthright
[32:39] he cheated for the blessing
[32:42] right he cheated for the birthright
[32:45] cheated for the blessing
[32:46] and now he was cheating for the cattle
[32:48] for his wages
[32:49] amen and he was increasing his wages
[32:52] through deception and through trickery
[32:53] and now all the brothers of laban get
[32:55] upset with him and now he's under
[32:57] pressure
[32:58] amen and now he decides to go back home
[33:00] and as he's going back home he's got to
[33:02] encounter esau
[33:03] and he saws another one who's who's fell
[33:05] victim
[33:06] to his tricks his tricks
[33:09] and he knows that esau is going to judge
[33:11] him and he's deserving of being judged
[33:13] and it puts him in desperation and when
[33:16] he gets in desperation
[33:17] he crosses the river and goes by himself
[33:20] to the other side
[33:21] amen because this is the key to the
[33:23] sixth seal amen to get you by yourself
[33:26] in desperation so that you can come face
[33:28] to face with god
[33:30] and jacob wrestles with a man through
[33:32] the night and the wrestling with that
[33:34] man
[33:34] under his sixth seal of desperation puts
[33:36] him in contact with god
[33:38] and god will touch him through that
[33:40] period and it will change his walk from
[33:42] that day forward he'll halt upon his leg
[33:45] he'll never walk
[33:46] the same way again that's the sixth seal
[33:50] experience that we want to have
[33:53] and then he recognizes now that i've met
[33:56] god
[33:57] face to face who's god
[34:00] the seventh seal so these seals have
[34:03] been coming right up
[34:06] so now he says he typed it in egypt
[34:09] down in egypt when moses goes as a
[34:12] prophet to deliver out of egypt
[34:13] the people are once again in tribulation
[34:16] and they're in trouble
[34:17] they rose up a pharaoh who knew not
[34:20] joseph and he begins to bring
[34:21] he begins to become a cruel task master
[34:24] amen
[34:24] and begins to punish the jews severely
[34:27] amen and and moses shows up as a
[34:30] delivering
[34:31] prophet but as a delivering prophet in
[34:34] the time of trouble
[34:35] he brings plagues down upon the gentiles
[34:39] which is the same thing the two prophets
[34:41] are going to do moses and elijah
[34:43] through the tribulation period they're
[34:44] going to bring plagues down upon the
[34:45] gentiles
[34:47] what brother bam said so he typed it all
[34:49] the way back in egypt
[34:50] and they come out of egypt under the
[34:53] sixth seal
[34:55] and then he says then he we see it typed
[34:58] out
[34:59] at the cross and i want to look at that
[35:01] one for a minute together let's go to
[35:03] the book of mark
[35:06] mark chapter 15. so brother i'm still
[35:09] talking about the sixth seal
[35:11] typed out at the cross
[35:17] it's amazing i told you before but i'll
[35:20] repeat it here again
[35:22] that jesus passes through the sixth seal
[35:26] and you say but he never did anything
[35:29] wrong
[35:30] he was virgin born he never sinned
[35:34] but the sixth seal is a judgment seal
[35:37] but also has
[35:38] a redemption seal and when jesus is
[35:41] going to pass through the sixth seal
[35:43] he's going to redeem through the sixth
[35:45] seal
[35:46] and by the purchase of his blood he's
[35:48] gonna redeem back
[35:49] all the lost children of god so it's a
[35:52] judgment seal
[35:53] and a redemption seal so mark 15
[35:58] 24
[36:02] for there shall arise false christs and
[36:05] false prophets
[36:08] nope sorry i'm in matthew mark sorry
[36:12] i started turning then i started talking
[36:15] and i quit turning all right mark 15
[36:20] and verse 24 and when they had crucified
[36:24] him they parted his garments casting
[36:26] lots upon them
[36:27] what every man should take and it was
[36:29] the third hour and they crucified him
[36:31] and the subscription of his accusation
[36:33] was written over the king of the jew
[36:35] written over the king of the jews and
[36:38] and with him they crucified two thieves
[36:40] the one on his right hand
[36:41] and the other one is left so when we
[36:43] come to the crucifixion
[36:44] and then jesus is is nailed to the cross
[36:47] at the third hour of the day
[36:48] now the day starts at 6 a.m so the third
[36:51] hour of the day would be 9 a.m
[36:53] so at 9 00 a.m they begin to crucify him
[36:56] and and then let's pick it up here in
[36:58] verse 15 or chapter 15
[37:00] verse 33 and when the sixth hour of the
[37:04] day come there was darkness over the
[37:06] whole land until the ninth
[37:08] hour and at the ninth hour jesus cried
[37:10] with a loud voice saying
[37:11] eloise lama
[37:14] i think which is being interpreted my
[37:17] god my god
[37:18] why hast thou forsaken me so now he's
[37:21] totally forsaken by god because
[37:23] upon him was put the whole sin of the
[37:25] world amen and god had to depart from
[37:27] him so that he could judge him
[37:29] because going through the sixth seal the
[37:31] judgment seal would bring redemption to
[37:33] all the seed
[37:34] amen because it wasn't jesus that had
[37:37] needed to go through the sixth seal it
[37:38] was me that needed to go through the
[37:40] sixth seal and it was every one that
[37:42] would be born
[37:43] wrong amen through a sexual birth amen
[37:45] they would need to go
[37:46] through the sixth seal so he came as a
[37:49] perfect lamb
[37:50] and in him inside of him
[37:53] within him he was the fullness of the
[37:55] word amen and if you're a sieging of god
[37:58] with the attribute of god you are part
[38:00] of that word amen
[38:01] so if he was the fullness of the word
[38:03] and i am part of the word when you
[38:05] collect the fullness then i'm there
[38:08] i was there amen so that means i also
[38:11] amen was in the sixth seal with jesus
[38:14] christ
[38:15] that's why that's why god cannot let
[38:17] this bride
[38:18] go through the tribulation period
[38:20] because she's already paid for her sins
[38:23] when did she pay for her sins when she
[38:25] was with him
[38:26] when he was reckoned we were reconciled
[38:28] with him in the body of his flesh
[38:31] remember we were reconciled we've
[38:33] already been reconciled to god when were
[38:34] we reconciled we were reconciled
[38:37] in the body of his flesh because the
[38:39] word was made flesh
[38:41] and i'm part of the word
[38:45] amen if you're part of god you're part
[38:47] of the word if you have a c gene of god
[38:49] that's word
[38:50] amen where is the word laying down in
[38:52] your soul that's the word and if he was
[38:54] the fullness of the word you were there
[38:55] and the word bled for you and the word
[38:58] died for you
[38:59] and you already suffered your punishment
[39:01] there
[39:04] so he goes through the sixth seal
[39:07] for the elect seed is redemption
[39:11] for those who reject it it's going to
[39:13] bring destruction
[39:16] but but you see brother franco can you
[39:20] turn on my whiteboard i want to draw a
[39:21] picture
[39:23] i like this i told somebody i said i
[39:26] don't know if it does anything for the
[39:27] congregation but it sure helps me
[39:30] because when i sit and talk to people
[39:32] and say i would prefer
[39:34] to do all of this across a dining room
[39:36] table
[39:37] and then i pull out a paper i'll grab a
[39:39] napkin and i start drawing pictures and
[39:40] scribbling i turn it around
[39:42] by the time we're done with the
[39:43] discussion nobody can discern
[39:45] anything on the napkin but it helped me
[39:48] through the whole discussion
[39:50] but jesus comes to calvary
[39:58] and he's nailed to the cross at the
[40:00] third hour of the day
[40:03] and then at the sixth hour
[40:06] darkness falls
[40:10] what happens when the six seals open
[40:13] darkness falls what happened in egypt
[40:16] under the sixth seal
[40:17] darkness over all the land darkness the
[40:19] the
[40:20] sun turned to darkness the moon turned
[40:23] to blood amen which is an eclipse
[40:25] amen and sun turned to darkness darkness
[40:28] moon turned to blood
[40:29] and an earthquake all happens when jesus
[40:32] dies
[40:33] because jesus dies amen under the sixth
[40:35] seal
[40:37] i hope you understand me enough to
[40:38] understand what i'm saying
[40:41] until the ninth hour of the day the
[40:43] night that this is 9 00 am
[40:46] this is noon and this is 3 pm
[40:52] if you look at the period of time he was
[40:53] on the cross
[40:55] he was on the cross for six hours
[40:58] why it's the sixth seal it's the
[41:01] judgment of man
[41:02] it was a man who could stand in the
[41:04] place for all of mankind
[41:06] amen when somebody had to come and take
[41:08] the book in revelation chapter four
[41:10] it couldn't be an angel a seraphim it
[41:12] could be it had to be a man
[41:14] amen and six is the number of man and
[41:16] six is the number of judgment
[41:17] and here jesus christ comes he's on the
[41:19] cross for six
[41:20] hours and in the sixth hour of the day
[41:22] it turns to darkness
[41:24] so that we will see that this is the
[41:26] sixth seal
[41:30] three p.m 3 p.m is an important time
[41:34] because this is the afternoon amen
[41:37] before passover
[41:38] and the passover the jewish day is not
[41:40] like our day we go
[41:42] midnight to midnight right but the
[41:44] jewish day goes
[41:45] sundown to sundown right so your day
[41:48] starts when the sun sets
[41:50] so passover was going to begin at the
[41:52] sunset on the day
[41:54] jesus christ was crucified that's why
[41:56] they come to the pilot
[41:57] and they asked pilate amen could you
[42:00] hurry this thing along and get these
[42:02] bodies down before sunset before
[42:04] passover
[42:05] because it was a holy sabbath unto them
[42:07] and they had to get them down
[42:08] that's why they went and broke the legs
[42:11] of the other two
[42:12] amen because when you're nailed to the
[42:13] cross amen you slump
[42:15] down you're you're nailed to the cross
[42:17] you slump down and it cuts off your air
[42:19] passage you can't breathe
[42:21] and as you get weaker you keep you keep
[42:23] whatever called exficiating or whatever
[42:25] that's called
[42:26] you can't breathe for us common folks
[42:30] and so they would push against the nail
[42:32] between their legs
[42:33] and rub their back up against the cross
[42:36] to get a breath
[42:37] and fall back down and they would keep
[42:39] themselves alive
[42:41] amen and this was the whole point of
[42:42] crucifixion it was supposed to be a
[42:44] horrible death
[42:45] and it was a horrible horrible way to
[42:47] die and so they
[42:49] would keep pushing up so now they've got
[42:51] to get these bodies
[42:52] off of the cross before sunset
[42:56] so they go and they break the legs of
[42:58] the other two so they can no longer push
[43:00] themselves up
[43:01] and they suffocate to death and die but
[43:04] when they came to jesus they found him
[43:06] already dead
[43:07] because the scripture says not one bone
[43:09] will be broken everything is
[43:12] orchestrated by the scriptures
[43:15] and so now that there was
[43:18] in the temple worship tradition
[43:21] the lambs were killed before evening
[43:25] and during during the the before the
[43:27] evening time before the sun sets
[43:29] before the passover starts they would
[43:31] kill the lambs
[43:32] so in temple worship on the day before
[43:35] passover
[43:36] before passover starts at sunset just
[43:39] before that they would slay all the
[43:41] lambs for passover
[43:42] and guess what time they would slay the
[43:45] lamb for passover
[43:46] they would slay the lamb at 3 pm
[43:51] and so at 3 pm jesus gives up the ghost
[43:54] and he dies
[43:55] because he is the ultimate passover lamb
[43:58] he is the final passover lamb where the
[44:01] head of the household god himself
[44:03] took his lamb and offered his lamb for
[44:06] his whole household
[44:08] for a deliverance and he showed that
[44:10] this is my sixth seal
[44:12] my requirement is now met through the
[44:14] sixth seal
[44:15] and it's going to bring redemption to
[44:17] the seed but there's been judgment upon
[44:19] this vessel
[44:19] and he is the passover lamb and he dies
[44:22] at 3 p.m
[44:23] and the same time jesus is crying out
[44:26] and giving up the ghost
[44:27] the priests are slitting the throat of a
[44:30] paschal lamb
[44:31] at the same time remember how brother
[44:33] branham said they're in the temple
[44:35] singing the psalm and they could look
[44:37] out the window and see him
[44:38] and the one that they're speaking of is
[44:39] nailed to the cross
[44:42] well it gets worse than that because the
[44:44] very the very thing that moses told them
[44:46] to do was showing that this one would
[44:48] come
[44:49] and they so rejected him they wanted to
[44:51] keep their traditional form of worship
[44:53] and while he's becoming the passover
[44:55] lamb they're slaying their own passover
[44:57] lamb
[44:58] because they would rather have the
[44:59] tradition than have what god sent
[45:02] and that's been the problem all along
[45:05] and it's the problem in the message it's
[45:07] the same way
[45:08] we'd rather have the tradition than have
[45:10] what god sends
[45:12] we'd rather stick with what we've always
[45:14] stuck with amen because this looks too
[45:17] radical
[45:18] jesus looked radical the things he said
[45:21] the scriptures he used
[45:22] amen the things that happened all around
[45:24] him the crowd that he attracted
[45:29] it was completely radical and it
[45:31] couldn't be because they had got it in
[45:33] such a way with their own denominational
[45:35] mindset
[45:35] they got it in such a way in such a form
[45:38] of thinking amen that they
[45:39] they couldn't they couldn't allow it
[45:41] wasn't supposed to be this way
[45:43] it wasn't supposed to this wasn't the
[45:45] way it was supposed to look like
[45:46] and you know it was supposed to be
[45:48] different and we were supposed to be
[45:50] included
[45:52] us pharisees and high priests and and
[45:54] you know what and they had the
[45:55] opportunity to be included but they
[45:57] didn't want to be included
[46:01] because they love the praise of men more
[46:02] than they love the praise of god
[46:05] but now they god sends a perfect lamb
[46:10] a man virgin born
[46:13] they deny his virgin birth
[46:17] virgin born lamb of god and fulfills the
[46:20] scripture to the letter
[46:22] but because he fulfills it in a way they
[46:24] didn't expect
[46:26] see this is what brother branham did and
[46:27] this is the way that he was so rejected
[46:29] at the end of his ministry
[46:30] because they didn't expect the
[46:32] fulfillment of the scriptures
[46:33] to be that little humble man from
[46:36] kentucky with the seventh grade
[46:37] education
[46:38] and the little bitty old church building
[46:40] at the corner of eighth and penn street
[46:42] they didn't expect that that was going
[46:44] to be the manger where the lamb was born
[46:49] amen and that's why he was so rejected
[46:51] amen he was he was showing plainly
[46:53] amen that this is the ministry of
[46:54] malachi 4 this is luke 17
[46:57] 30. this is the fulfillment of
[46:58] scriptures amen and they couldn't accept
[47:00] that
[47:01] because it wasn't it wasn't in
[47:02] concordance with the idea that we
[47:04] already had
[47:05] and i say god break that thing out of me
[47:08] thoroughly and i say it again and again
[47:11] because no matter how much we think it's
[47:13] broke
[47:13] it ain't broke yet friends we still
[47:17] have a tendency to go back to carnal
[47:19] understanding and carnal thinking and
[47:21] old denominational teaching and here
[47:24] they are
[47:24] the very hour he's giving up the ghost
[47:27] they're slitting the throat
[47:28] for another lamb
[47:32] and now it's pointless
[47:36] before it was right it was the thing to
[47:40] do
[47:41] at 3 p.m on the eve before passover
[47:44] slay the lamb keep the word keep moving
[47:47] forward
[47:48] amen you know what they were supposed to
[47:49] be place holders on the word
[47:52] to keep the symbolism of the word moving
[47:55] forward
[47:55] till a prophet could come and tell them
[47:57] what it all means
[48:00] that's what's happened to the church
[48:01] ages keeping the word see this much holy
[48:03] see this much holding there's nothing
[48:05] wrong with holding it that's what they
[48:06] were supposed to do the jews were the
[48:08] oracles of god they were supposed to
[48:10] hold
[48:10] amen what had been given to them from
[48:12] moses and hold it until a prophet could
[48:14] come and say
[48:14] this is that this is that this is that
[48:18] but they got so much in love with
[48:20] holding
[48:21] amen the symbolism and when the reality
[48:24] came
[48:24] they wanted the symbolism and not the
[48:26] reality
[48:30] praise be to god say god help me i want
[48:33] your reality
[48:35] help me to drop the symbol every day for
[48:37] the real amen that's what i want
[48:40] so jesus died
[48:43] 3 pm 6 hours on the cross
[48:48] and it turned dark at the sixth hour of
[48:51] the day
[48:53] these things are more than coincidence
[48:56] they're beautiful
[48:58] the word is beautiful brother benham
[49:01] says
[49:02] on the sixth seal again it's in matthew
[49:04] 27
[49:06] let's see what he did there here matthew
[49:08] the 27th chapter now remember his son
[49:11] had been beaten and had been troubled
[49:12] and they had made fun of him and he was
[49:14] now hanging on the cross
[49:16] at three o'clock on good friday
[49:17] afternoon just about to take place
[49:19] matthew 27th chapter
[49:21] 45th verse i believe it is from the
[49:24] sixth hour
[49:25] there was darkness over the land until
[49:27] the ninth hour what's brother branham
[49:29] preaching he's preaching the sixth seal
[49:31] he's putting this in the sixth seal
[49:32] because he says it was typed out at the
[49:34] cross
[49:35] now notice just exactly what he did back
[49:38] here on this see
[49:39] and i beheld when he had opened the
[49:41] sixth seal low there was a great
[49:42] earthquake and the sun became black a
[49:44] sackcloth of hair
[49:45] and the moon and the moon became his
[49:48] blood
[49:48] blackness darkness egypt blackness
[49:51] darkness
[49:51] he see what brother brahm's doing can we
[49:53] see what he's doing brother ben is now
[49:55] preaching the sixth seal
[49:57] he's going to calvary he's showing at
[49:59] the six-hour darkness sets in
[50:01] and he says darkness blackness see egypt
[50:04] he's going he's going right for brother
[50:06] branham it's all the same thing
[50:09] he's not going well this was scriptures
[50:11] for egypt and this is scriptures for
[50:13] jesus
[50:13] crucifixion and now there'll be
[50:15] scriptures for the tribulation period
[50:17] he's not doing that in this sixth seal
[50:19] he's showing you
[50:20] now he's showing it to you in matthew 27
[50:23] at calvary
[50:24] now at the six hour of the day it turns
[50:25] darkness see darkness blackness see
[50:28] egypt because brother branham sees the
[50:32] seals through the whole bible
[50:33] the mystery of redemption has unlocked
[50:35] the entire bible and you can lay that
[50:37] pattern of redemption
[50:38] over the bible here and here and here
[50:41] and here and it works all through
[50:45] so so the sixth deal has been in effect
[50:48] all along
[50:52] praise be to god that might stumble
[50:54] somebody but it's the truth
[50:59] from the sixth hour that there was
[51:01] darkness blackness darkness egypt
[51:03] darkness darkness god delivering jesus
[51:05] at the cross
[51:06] just before he brought him up from the
[51:07] resurrection first darkness sun went
[51:10] down the middle of the day stars
[51:11] wouldn't shine
[51:12] two days from then he was going to raise
[51:13] him up with a mighty triumph
[51:15] and after the sun and moon and stars and
[51:17] everything in egypt all
[51:18] feasts take place he delivered israel to
[51:21] the promised land
[51:23] he's running back and forth between
[51:24] these two parallels so much he's jumping
[51:26] to where you're like
[51:27] what do you mean he comes up in the
[51:29] resurrection and he took egypt to the
[51:31] promised land
[51:33] what is coming up in the resurrection
[51:34] having to do with bringing egypt to the
[51:35] promised land
[51:36] it's the same story in another form
[51:40] it's the same seal in another form it's
[51:43] the same redemption
[51:44] in another form and brother ben has no
[51:47] problem jumping back and forth
[51:49] from egypt to the cross to egypt
[51:52] praise be to god that's the way i want
[51:56] to see the word
[51:57] where it all links together telling one
[52:00] story
[52:02] one story the bible's not telling 66
[52:05] stories
[52:06] the bible's telling one story one goal
[52:09] one thing god wanted to achieve in all
[52:11] the scriptures
[52:14] and he did it in a three-fold purpose
[52:16] what's that
[52:17] the one thing he wanted to do the one
[52:19] objective he's had
[52:20] the mystery that's been in the back part
[52:22] of his mind and he wanted to achieve
[52:23] and the whole bible's been telling of it
[52:26] and what's that mystery
[52:28] get preeminence in a man he did that in
[52:29] christ jesus preeminence and
[52:31] and a people he's doing that now in the
[52:34] bride
[52:35] to restore them back to eden that's been
[52:39] the whole purpose of the seals
[52:40] the whole purpose of the bible the whole
[52:42] purpose of everything
[52:44] is that one purpose and when our
[52:47] revelation of the word
[52:48] can't match that one purpose we need to
[52:50] throw away our revelation of the word
[52:51] until it can match that one purpose
[52:57] let's look at this in matthew 27 let's
[52:59] turn there together
[53:00] the scripture that brother brahm's
[53:02] referring to
[53:07] matthew 27 and we'll go to 45.
[53:14] trying to hold myself back and go slow
[53:16] because i tend to
[53:17] just go too fast and we miss all the
[53:19] scriptures and the meats in the
[53:20] scriptures
[53:21] and i don't want to buzz over it i just
[53:23] want to
[53:25] really look at it matthew 27 and 45
[53:30] now from the sixth hour there was
[53:31] darkness over all the land unto the
[53:33] ninth hour
[53:34] and about the ninth hour jesus cried
[53:36] with a loud voice
[53:38] that was to say my god my god why has
[53:40] thou forsaken me
[53:42] some of them that stood there when they
[53:44] heard that said this man
[53:45] calleth for elias and straightway one of
[53:48] them ran and took a sponge and filled it
[53:49] with vinegar and put it on the reed and
[53:51] gave him the drink
[53:52] and the rest said let it be and see
[53:54] where their lives will come and save him
[53:55] jesus
[53:56] when he had cried again with a loud
[53:57] voice yielded up the ghost
[53:59] and behold the veil of the temple was
[54:01] written twain from the top to the bottom
[54:03] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[54:05] ran and the graves were open and many
[54:07] bodies of the saints would slept
[54:09] arose and came out of the graves after
[54:11] his resurrection and went into the holy
[54:13] city
[54:13] and appeared unto many now when the
[54:16] centurion and they that were with him
[54:17] watching jesus saw the earthquake and
[54:19] those things that were done
[54:21] they feared greatly saying truly this
[54:23] was
[54:24] the son of god so now
[54:27] you look at a sequence of events under
[54:29] the sixth seal
[54:31] and under the sixth seal oh praise god
[54:36] under the sixth seal jesus he gives up
[54:40] the ghost amen judgment is now completed
[54:43] and and there's darkness
[54:46] right darkness and
[54:50] and the moon became blood became dark
[54:53] and there was an earthquake now there's
[54:56] one more thing that's interesting to
[54:58] note
[54:58] when you get over to acts chapter 2 when
[55:01] when
[55:01] peter begins preaching to the jews on
[55:04] the inaugural day of the church he
[55:06] refers them to joel's prophecy
[55:09] and when he refers to joel's prophecy he
[55:11] says the sun will be dark and the moon
[55:13] turned to blood
[55:14] though he says in and if you look i've
[55:18] went and looked at it
[55:19] if you look on nasa's lunar chart
[55:23] and you type in that date april 3rd ad33
[55:28] you find out that there was there was a
[55:31] full moon
[55:32] that day in egypt that was viewed from
[55:35] jerusalem
[55:35] and there was a lunar eclipse that day
[55:39] and if you look at the it was a partial
[55:41] eclipse it wasn't a total eclipse it
[55:42] wasn't a total blackout
[55:44] but if you go back and you run the
[55:46] charts if you watch the way that the
[55:48] moon rises
[55:50] that night you know 3 pm jesus dies
[55:53] time of the sacrifice of the passover
[55:55] lambs they take his body down
[55:57] and they get him buried they got to have
[55:59] the body off the cross before sunset
[56:01] right from the third hour of the day to
[56:03] the ninth hour from noon to three pm
[56:05] there was blackness that covered
[56:07] everything
[56:09] then when the sun sets after the sun
[56:12] sets the moon begins to rise over
[56:13] jerusalem
[56:14] and as the moon begins to rise it's in a
[56:17] partial eclipse and the part that's
[56:19] coming over the horizon
[56:20] is a blood moon on the day he dies
[56:26] why because this is the sixth seal
[56:30] turned to darkness sun turned to
[56:33] darkness moon turned to blood
[56:35] and an earthquake and when he gives up
[56:36] the ghost there's an earthquake
[56:38] amen and when there's an earthquake the
[56:40] temple veil
[56:41] rinse in two and they can see the holy
[56:44] of holies and they can recognize
[56:45] now that there is no shekinah glory here
[56:49] anymore it's done it's a transition time
[56:54] so so now the the you have an earthquake
[56:57] you have the sun turning black and you
[57:00] have the moon turning to blood
[57:02] all part of joel's prophecy and all part
[57:05] of the sixth seal
[57:07] showing the sixth seal was in effect
[57:09] right there at calvary
[57:12] i love these things i absolutely love it
[57:16] amen because it just continues it keeps
[57:18] going and going and going
[57:20] the scripture just keeps tying together
[57:23] now let's go to matthew 28.
[57:27] verse 1 now
[57:30] in the end of the sabbath as it began to
[57:32] to dawn toward the first day of the week
[57:34] came mary magdalene and the other mary
[57:36] to see the sepulcher and behold
[57:38] there was a great earthquake for the
[57:40] angel of the lord descended from heaven
[57:41] and came and rolled back the stone from
[57:43] the door and sat upon it
[57:46] so there was another earthquake the
[57:48] earth the first earthquake
[57:50] when there was this first earthquake the
[57:52] temple veil was rent
[57:55] right and it exposed the mercy seat
[58:00] and now so what it what did the with the
[58:02] earthquake do
[58:04] it rent the temple veil it broke the
[58:06] seal
[58:07] because the holy of holies was sealed by
[58:09] this veil
[58:11] it was the 28 cubic curtain that hid the
[58:14] holy of holies
[58:15] from everybody else in the holy place
[58:17] and they couldn't see it so there was a
[58:19] seal
[58:19] there was a seal that had to be broke
[58:22] and under the sixth seal
[58:23] there was an earthquake that broke the
[58:25] seal
[58:28] and then three days later there's an
[58:29] earthquake that breaks another seal and
[58:32] brother bam said it broke the roman seal
[58:35] and then you had the mystery of the
[58:37] resurrection
[58:38] now christ comes forth what is it it's
[58:40] the coming of the lord he came back
[58:43] he came out of the grave amen under the
[58:46] seventh seal
[58:47] so now i want to i want to keep i went
[58:50] through all of this to show the sequence
[58:52] of the sixth seal
[58:53] but i want to now take a turn and look
[58:55] at matthew 24
[58:58] because we're still in the sixth seal
[58:59] message brother brahm talks about all
[59:01] this in the six seal message when you
[59:04] when you study the sixth seal it's
[59:06] important to recognize too
[59:07] uh some things brother ben is preaching
[59:09] on the sixth seal he picks it up in
[59:10] questions and answers
[59:11] the next service the next morning and
[59:13] again in the seventh seal
[59:15] so if you want to read it all it's in
[59:16] the sixth seal it's in questions and
[59:18] answers
[59:19] on the seals and it's in the seventh
[59:20] seal but i want to look at matthew 24
[59:24] now when we get to matthew 24 verse 1
[59:27] it says then jesus went out and departed
[59:29] from the temple
[59:30] and his disciples came to him for to
[59:32] show him the building of the temple
[59:34] and jesus said unto them see not all
[59:36] these things verily i say unto you there
[59:38] shall not be left here
[59:39] one stone upon another that shall not be
[59:41] thrown down
[59:43] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[59:45] the disciples came unto him
[59:48] and privately saying tell us when shall
[59:50] these things be
[59:52] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[59:54] and in the end of the world
[59:55] so brother bam is very clear and he says
[59:57] they asked three questions
[59:59] this is not all lumped together in one
[1:00:01] thing when will these these be when will
[1:00:03] not
[1:00:03] one stone on the temple be left on
[1:00:05] another what will be the sign of your
[1:00:07] coming
[1:00:08] and the end of the world so jesus is
[1:00:11] going to answer
[1:00:12] three different questions and if you
[1:00:14] don't recognize that and lump it all
[1:00:15] together
[1:00:16] that's why we'll have people teaching
[1:00:18] post-millennialism and all these other
[1:00:20] things because
[1:00:20] they see something in the scripture what
[1:00:23] they see is true
[1:00:24] and it is genuine and it exactly matches
[1:00:26] the word amen but they didn't realize
[1:00:28] he's answering three questions not
[1:00:30] one so when will the
[1:00:33] temple be torn down what will be the
[1:00:35] sign of that coming end of the end of
[1:00:37] the world
[1:00:38] so he goes from there and brother bam
[1:00:40] takes us right down through
[1:00:42] the uh the seals the first five seals
[1:00:46] and then we get then we get over here
[1:00:48] and he's gonna get to the sixth seal
[1:00:50] and he picks up the sixth seal over in
[1:00:53] verse 29.
[1:00:56] over in 29 he picks up the sixth seal
[1:00:58] and he says
[1:00:59] immediately after the tribulation of
[1:01:01] those days shall the sun be darkened and
[1:01:03] the moon shall not give her light
[1:01:05] and the star shall fall from heaven and
[1:01:07] the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[1:01:09] so when when the prophet of god comes
[1:01:12] through matthew 24 he shows the seals
[1:01:14] now he comes to the sixth seal and he
[1:01:16] goes to verse 29
[1:01:18] and he says immediately after the
[1:01:19] tribulation of those days
[1:01:21] now the question is what tribulation of
[1:01:24] what days
[1:01:25] and he answers the question he says
[1:01:29] in the sixth seal he said we look at
[1:01:31] that and there's nothing in the world i
[1:01:32] don't believe but that bunch of jews has
[1:01:34] went through a pre-tribulation period
[1:01:37] when
[1:01:38] during the time of this last wars they
[1:01:41] they're they're got to be hated by
[1:01:43] everybody and eichmann killed millions
[1:01:44] of them in germany
[1:01:46] you just heard the trial millions of
[1:01:48] innocent people slain
[1:01:49] jews just because they were jews no
[1:01:52] other reason
[1:01:53] so he says what is this tribulation he
[1:01:56] calls it a pre-tribulation or an
[1:01:58] amateur tribulation but he ties it to
[1:02:00] the tribulation of those days
[1:02:02] he ties it to verse 29 and it's
[1:02:05] important to know where
[1:02:06] he ties it and where he places it amen
[1:02:08] because it makes everything else matter
[1:02:11] so it's really important to understand
[1:02:13] that let's turn
[1:02:14] hold your place in matthew 24 go to
[1:02:17] revelation with me
[1:02:19] revelation 9.
[1:02:25] revelation chapter 9 and verse 13.
[1:02:29] i know this is slow it's a slow this is
[1:02:32] slower than i like to go
[1:02:35] but i want to stay i want to i want to
[1:02:37] take our time here
[1:02:38] for just a few minutes and the sixth
[1:02:41] angel sounded this is the trumpets
[1:02:43] and the six angels sounded and i heard a
[1:02:45] voice from the four horns of the golden
[1:02:47] altars which is before god saying to the
[1:02:49] sixth angel which had the trumpet
[1:02:51] loose the four angels which are bound in
[1:02:53] the great river euphrates and the four
[1:02:55] angels were loosed which were prepared
[1:02:57] for an hour and a day and a month and a
[1:03:00] year
[1:03:01] for the slay the third part of men and
[1:03:03] the number of the army of the horsemen
[1:03:04] were two hundred thousand thousand and i
[1:03:06] heard the number of them
[1:03:08] and thus i saw the horses in the vision
[1:03:10] them that sat on them having
[1:03:12] breastplates of fire and adjacent and
[1:03:13] brimstone and
[1:03:14] the heads of the horses were as the
[1:03:16] heads of lions and out of their mouths
[1:03:17] that should fire
[1:03:18] smoke and brimstone by these three was
[1:03:21] the third part of men killed by the fire
[1:03:23] by the smoke by the brimstone which
[1:03:25] issued out of their mounds
[1:03:27] now brother bam comes to this and he
[1:03:29] says those were
[1:03:31] not natural chargers he says they were
[1:03:34] demonic spirits they were demon powers
[1:03:36] that were released
[1:03:37] and he said where did they go they went
[1:03:39] into the armies of hitler
[1:03:40] mussolini and stalin to bring a bitter
[1:03:43] persecution against the jews
[1:03:46] so we know he says the sixth seal
[1:03:49] and the sixth trumpet open at the same
[1:03:51] time
[1:03:52] is that right and then in matthew 24
[1:03:55] when he goes to the sixth seal
[1:03:57] he goes to verse 29 which says in the
[1:03:59] tribulation of those
[1:04:01] after the tribulation of those days and
[1:04:03] he ties that scripture
[1:04:05] back to the persecution of the jews at
[1:04:07] world war ii
[1:04:09] so we know where we're at right
[1:04:13] and he says they were they were not
[1:04:15] natural they're supernatural powers
[1:04:17] and in verse 18 by these three was the
[1:04:19] third part of men killed
[1:04:21] now brother bam tells us exactly where
[1:04:23] those demon powers go they go
[1:04:25] into a bitter persecution against the
[1:04:27] jews and it says a third part of the men
[1:04:29] were killed
[1:04:30] amen because during the holocaust
[1:04:32] pre-holocaust numbers of jews worldwide
[1:04:34] was 18 million
[1:04:36] but they killed six million jews during
[1:04:39] the holocaust
[1:04:40] one-third of all the jews
[1:04:43] and brother venom they already told us
[1:04:46] that that
[1:04:47] that is the persecution against the jews
[1:04:49] when they come out
[1:04:50] and bring a persecution against the jews
[1:04:52] and it says in the scriptures a third of
[1:04:54] the men die
[1:04:55] and and you can read it in the news you
[1:04:57] can read it in the history
[1:04:58] one third of the population of jews
[1:05:00] worldwide is wiped out
[1:05:02] and still has not recovered to that
[1:05:04] number yet
[1:05:06] so brother brahm is is he's placing us
[1:05:08] placing us
[1:05:09] right in the scriptures so that we won't
[1:05:12] miss it
[1:05:14] he further on in the sixth seal he says
[1:05:16] now the sixth seal is the one we're
[1:05:18] coming to
[1:05:19] matthew 24 29. and 30
[1:05:23] 24 let's get 29 and 30. here we are
[1:05:26] now now we're going to get also
[1:05:28] revelation
[1:05:29] 6 12 and 17. he's going to put those two
[1:05:31] together
[1:05:33] the sixth seal and revel in matthew 24
[1:05:36] 29
[1:05:38] and he starts to read now listen to this
[1:05:41] now it's
[1:05:41] what jesus said in matthew 29 24
[1:05:45] or 24 29 immediately after the
[1:05:47] tribulation of those days
[1:05:49] when this tribulation this amateur
[1:05:51] tribulation they've went through there
[1:05:54] the sun shall be darkened the moon shall
[1:05:56] not give her life and the star shall
[1:05:57] fall from heaven and the powers of
[1:05:59] heaven shall be shaken
[1:06:00] and then shall appear the sign of the
[1:06:03] son of man in heaven
[1:06:04] then shall be all the tribes of the
[1:06:05] earth mourn and they shall see the son
[1:06:07] of man coming in clouds of heaven
[1:06:09] with power and great glory
[1:06:12] then again he says in the sixth seal a
[1:06:14] little further on
[1:06:16] it says now perfect turn right back over
[1:06:17] see what jesus said here now matthew 24
[1:06:20] 29
[1:06:21] after this eichmann case eichmann was
[1:06:23] the one that was in charge of the
[1:06:25] of the holocaust he was the mastermind
[1:06:27] behind it that had all the jews killed
[1:06:29] so brother man when he says to see this
[1:06:31] eichmann case he's specifically
[1:06:33] placing amen this fulfillment of
[1:06:35] scripture right in for him which was
[1:06:37] very recent history
[1:06:38] just 20 years before the holocaust
[1:06:42] amen was going on from 1941 to 1945
[1:06:45] amen and so here brother branham is
[1:06:47] coming in 1963
[1:06:49] and he's pointing right back and saying
[1:06:51] that was it that was this tribulation
[1:06:53] that was the tribulation of those days
[1:06:54] that's it right there and that's the
[1:06:58] fulfillment
[1:06:59] amen that is a fulfillment of the sixth
[1:07:02] trumpet
[1:07:04] he said this tribulation this amateur
[1:07:06] tribulation they went through here
[1:07:08] the sun shall be darkened the moon shall
[1:07:10] not give her light
[1:07:12] now he says matthew 24 29 this eichmann
[1:07:15] case and so forth
[1:07:16] he reads it again and then shall appear
[1:07:20] the sign of the son of man in heaven and
[1:07:22] they shall see
[1:07:23] then shall all the tribes of the earth
[1:07:24] mourn and then shall they see the son of
[1:07:26] man coming in the clouds of heaven with
[1:07:27] great power and glory
[1:07:29] and send forth his angels and so forth
[1:07:31] with the sound of a trumpet and shall
[1:07:33] gather them the four winds drove
[1:07:34] together
[1:07:35] see just exactly comparing what jesus
[1:07:37] said in matthew 24
[1:07:39] and what the revelator here opened up in
[1:07:41] the sixth seal is just exactly and jesus
[1:07:43] was speaking of the tribulation period
[1:07:46] he's speaking of a tribulation period
[1:07:48] and there's coming a tribulation period
[1:07:50] but he in brother baum is speaking of
[1:07:53] the pre-tribulation or the amateur
[1:07:54] tribulation or the tribulation of those
[1:07:56] days
[1:07:57] amen which took place during world war
[1:07:59] ii
[1:08:00] there's a reason i'm saying this so hang
[1:08:02] with me we're going to get to it
[1:08:05] in the seventh seal message he says this
[1:08:08] time was between the sixth and seventh
[1:08:10] seal that he calls these people
[1:08:12] spoken of by jesus in matthew the 24th
[1:08:14] chapter
[1:08:15] the 31st verse so let's keep reading
[1:08:18] let's go to matthew 24
[1:08:20] and go back to 29.
[1:08:24] immediately after the tribulation of
[1:08:26] those days when
[1:08:27] the eichmann group world war ii sixth
[1:08:30] trumpet
[1:08:31] sixth seal uh two hundred thousand
[1:08:34] thousand demons we got that
[1:08:36] we're on the same page immediately after
[1:08:38] the tribulation of those days shall the
[1:08:39] sun be dark and the moon shall not give
[1:08:41] her life
[1:08:42] and the star shall fall from heaven and
[1:08:43] the powers of the heavens shall be
[1:08:45] shaken
[1:08:46] when brother man reads that he knows
[1:08:47] he's dealing with the sixth seal
[1:08:50] because it's the same thing and that's
[1:08:51] why he knew the cross was dealing with
[1:08:53] the sixth seal and that's why he knew
[1:08:54] egypt was dealing with the sixth seal
[1:08:59] verse 30 and then shall appear the sign
[1:09:01] of the son of man in heaven
[1:09:02] and then shall all the tribes of the
[1:09:04] earth mourn and they shall see the son
[1:09:05] of man coming in the clouds of heaven
[1:09:07] with power and great glory and he shall
[1:09:10] send his angels with a great sound of a
[1:09:12] trumpet
[1:09:12] and they shall gather together as elect
[1:09:14] from the four winds from one end of
[1:09:16] heaven
[1:09:17] to the other so now let's go back to the
[1:09:20] quote
[1:09:20] he says now matthew 24 31
[1:09:24] that send his angels with a great sound
[1:09:26] of a trumpet
[1:09:27] gather the elect from the four winds
[1:09:29] from one and of heaven to the other
[1:09:31] he said verse he said matthew 24 and the
[1:09:33] 31st verse that we've just read
[1:09:35] trumpets here are the two witnesses when
[1:09:37] the trumpet sounds it's the trumpet of
[1:09:39] the two witnesses of the age of grace
[1:09:41] for the jews
[1:09:42] one trumpet sound who knows one trumpet
[1:09:44] sounds he says and sound the trumpet
[1:09:46] notice over 31st and he shall send forth
[1:09:49] his angels
[1:09:49] he puts in parentheses not one see two
[1:09:52] of them
[1:09:53] it's plural two of them with a great
[1:09:55] sound of a trumpet
[1:09:56] what trumpet the great gospel trumpet
[1:09:59] the seventh seal with the great sound of
[1:10:02] a trumpet what is it when god gets ready
[1:10:04] to speak there's a sound of a trumpet
[1:10:06] that always his voice calling to battle
[1:10:08] god speaks these angels will come forth
[1:10:10] with the sounding of the trumpet
[1:10:13] so now i want to slow down just a minute
[1:10:15] i'm going slow but i want to back up and
[1:10:16] go slower
[1:10:18] i don't want to lose anybody because
[1:10:20] brother branham makes it so easy by
[1:10:21] putting these markers in these
[1:10:22] indicators
[1:10:23] and he's tying the sixth seal together
[1:10:26] with the sixth trumpet with matthew 24
[1:10:28] which is the sixth seal and the
[1:10:29] tribulation of those days and he's tying
[1:10:32] and he's linking all of these things
[1:10:33] together
[1:10:34] amen and he's not doing it just for a
[1:10:36] history lesson although
[1:10:37] we love the history lesson he's doing it
[1:10:39] so we can see
[1:10:40] something because when he gets to verse
[1:10:43] 31
[1:10:44] he says his sent forth his angels amen
[1:10:46] with the sound of a trumpet
[1:10:48] amen and brother man said a great
[1:10:50] trumpet amen
[1:10:51] one sound a great trumpet and brother
[1:10:52] benham says when those seven seals open
[1:10:54] there was
[1:10:55] one blast then all seven thunders
[1:10:57] uttered
[1:10:59] what was it he said it was the
[1:11:00] revelation of the seals
[1:11:02] it was the revelation of the seventh
[1:11:04] seal because the sounding fourth of
[1:11:05] those thunders consecutively in a row
[1:11:08] is the marking of the seventh seal and
[1:11:12] so
[1:11:12] now brother branham said when brother
[1:11:15] branham preached
[1:11:16] the seals amen he come he preached the
[1:11:19] entire
[1:11:19] revelation of jesus christ is that the
[1:11:22] complete revelation
[1:11:24] did brother branham leave out anything
[1:11:27] do we need another messenger to give us
[1:11:29] more on the revelation or did he
[1:11:30] complete the revelation
[1:11:32] so the revelation is completed christ is
[1:11:35] the mystery of god revealed
[1:11:37] amen and under the sounding of the
[1:11:38] seventh angel the mystery of god should
[1:11:40] be finished amen so brother branham tied
[1:11:42] together all the loose ends and after
[1:11:44] all the loose ends were tied together
[1:11:45] down comes an angel with an open book in
[1:11:47] his hand
[1:11:48] seven thunders under their voice amen
[1:11:50] it's the seventh seal
[1:11:52] and so now brother branham preaches
[1:11:53] christ the seventh seal christ the
[1:11:55] mystery of god revealed amen by taking
[1:11:57] the seals off the book
[1:11:59] and showing christ through the whole
[1:12:00] bible and then he says and christ is the
[1:12:02] mystery god revealed
[1:12:03] if you can't see christ in every line in
[1:12:06] every story
[1:12:07] he said go back and read it again
[1:12:08] because you missed something
[1:12:10] so now he takes the veil off and shows
[1:12:13] it's been christ
[1:12:14] in christ amen is the anointed word he
[1:12:17] said it was
[1:12:17] christ and moses it was christ in noah
[1:12:20] it was christ
[1:12:21] and david
[1:12:25] what is that christ the mystery of god
[1:12:26] revealed the mystery coming through the
[1:12:28] whole bible
[1:12:31] so now you have to say
[1:12:35] when that when it was time for the seven
[1:12:37] thunders utter there was
[1:12:38] one blast and brother branham said a
[1:12:41] blast that shook the whole earth
[1:12:45] because in the religious world that
[1:12:47] blast has shook the whole earth
[1:12:51] it was a blast that shook the whole
[1:12:52] earth
[1:12:54] and then the seven angels appeared amen
[1:12:56] then he got the revelation of the seven
[1:12:58] thunders
[1:12:58] and one blast seven thunders
[1:13:02] and so that was the great trumpet the
[1:13:04] great completing of the gospel the great
[1:13:06] wrap of the gospel
[1:13:07] that great trumpet sound of the great
[1:13:09] seventh gospel trumpet sounded
[1:13:11] right and brother man brought the
[1:13:13] revelation of the whole thing what would
[1:13:14] happen to the jews what happened to the
[1:13:16] uh the foolish virgin he brought the
[1:13:18] whole revelation who the elect are
[1:13:20] all of it so then when these two
[1:13:23] witnesses
[1:13:23] when they go to sound forth what message
[1:13:26] are they going to sound
[1:13:29] what will they preach do they have a
[1:13:32] different revelation of christ is there
[1:13:35] more
[1:13:36] is there something brother benham didn't
[1:13:37] cover we know that they're going to give
[1:13:38] the interpretation of what the actual
[1:13:40] trumpets were that brought them back
[1:13:42] am in the inn gathering but brother said
[1:13:44] that's for them
[1:13:45] that's for the jews but when they come
[1:13:47] to be introduced to christ
[1:13:49] the true sacrifice the living word amen
[1:13:52] where where did that message come from
[1:13:55] brother bam said they're gonna they're
[1:13:56] gonna receive the same message
[1:14:00] i don't know how it'll come i don't know
[1:14:01] how to get it i don't know if they used
[1:14:03] brother bennett's books i have no idea
[1:14:04] but the same revelation of jesus christ
[1:14:07] the same message the same revelation of
[1:14:09] the seals
[1:14:10] is what the 144 thousand what was that
[1:14:13] that was a great trumpet that was the
[1:14:15] blast that was the wrap-up that was the
[1:14:17] seventh seal
[1:14:18] that was the one coming who could unlock
[1:14:20] the mystery of the whole bible
[1:14:22] and now what are they going to do under
[1:14:24] that great trumpet they're going to
[1:14:26] reconnect the jews
[1:14:28] with their messiah and they're going to
[1:14:30] recognize come to the feast of atonement
[1:14:31] and recognize
[1:14:32] this has been him all along and they're
[1:14:34] going to take him from the sacrifice of
[1:14:36] goats and
[1:14:37] and and geese and whatever brother
[1:14:39] branham says there and they're going to
[1:14:40] connect them to the
[1:14:42] real living sacrifice the word
[1:14:46] so they can't preach anything else
[1:14:49] because brother branham already preached
[1:14:51] it
[1:14:52] so that great trumpet amen is the
[1:14:54] seventh seal
[1:14:56] the mystery of christ revealed
[1:14:59] so we know verse 31 we know who they are
[1:15:04] we know who they preach to and we know
[1:15:06] what they preach
[1:15:10] i don't need to be here to hear it i've
[1:15:12] already heard it
[1:15:15] have you been connected to the real
[1:15:18] atonement
[1:15:19] the bleeding bloody word amen
[1:15:23] so now i want to read through this again
[1:15:25] we know verse 29
[1:15:28] verse 29 is the tribulation the
[1:15:31] pre-tribulation or amateur tribulation
[1:15:33] of the jews the eichmann case through
[1:15:35] the war
[1:15:37] verse 31 is the two witnesses to the
[1:15:39] jews
[1:15:41] so what's verse 30
[1:15:46] let's start at 29 immediately after the
[1:15:48] tribulation of those days shall the sun
[1:15:49] be darkened and the moon shall not give
[1:15:51] her life
[1:15:51] and the star shall fall from heaven and
[1:15:54] the powers of the heavens shall be
[1:15:55] shaken
[1:15:56] and then shall appear the son the sign
[1:15:58] of the son of man in heaven
[1:16:00] and then shall all the tribes of earth
[1:16:02] mourn and they shall see the son of man
[1:16:04] coming in the clouds of heaven
[1:16:05] with power and great glory i want to ask
[1:16:08] you a question
[1:16:09] have you seen the sign of the son of man
[1:16:10] coming have you seen that cloud
[1:16:13] amen have you seen it it's shrouded by
[1:16:15] seven angels where did you hear brother
[1:16:17] branham say
[1:16:18] that they told me to turn it to the
[1:16:19] right he says i'm looking at it right no
[1:16:21] turn it to the right
[1:16:22] oh what is it it's christ he said what
[1:16:24] is it it's our lord
[1:16:26] up there it's the sign of the coming of
[1:16:30] the son of man
[1:16:31] so in between amen the pre-tribulation
[1:16:34] period
[1:16:35] aiming to the jews and the witness of
[1:16:37] the two
[1:16:39] prophets this has to happen verse 30
[1:16:42] and praise god it's happened amen we've
[1:16:45] seen it
[1:16:46] we are standing between verse 30
[1:16:49] and 31 we know where we are in the
[1:16:51] scriptures we know who we are
[1:16:53] we know what our ministry is we're
[1:16:54] standing between verse 30 and 31
[1:16:57] and matthew 24. i hope you're standing
[1:17:00] there
[1:17:01] i hope you're standing amen amen oh
[1:17:04] praise god
[1:17:05] i hope you're standing in revelations 10
[1:17:07] 8-11 prophesy again
[1:17:09] i hope you can go past that into
[1:17:11] revelations 11
[1:17:12] because in revelations 11 john is given
[1:17:15] a read
[1:17:16] now and john is going to measure the
[1:17:18] temple
[1:17:19] and the altar and the true worship and
[1:17:21] the gentile
[1:17:22] court that's given outside because
[1:17:24] something's been given to john
[1:17:26] he's been giving a measuring tool that
[1:17:28] he can measure by
[1:17:29] and now john which is a type of the
[1:17:31] bride can take the measuring tool of the
[1:17:33] open book
[1:17:34] and can describe amen to true worship
[1:17:36] the true place of worship
[1:17:38] the true altar of worship and who's on
[1:17:40] the outside
[1:17:46] where are we at friends amen at the end
[1:17:49] of the end
[1:17:50] of the end for the gentiles we've come
[1:17:53] to the very end
[1:17:54] can you find your scriptures can you
[1:17:55] find your place in the bible
[1:17:57] do you know where you're at
[1:18:00] or do we just have to sit down and say
[1:18:02] well you know i know the message is true
[1:18:04] and
[1:18:04] it'll all be solved out later brother
[1:18:06] branham already solved it out we just
[1:18:07] got to take what he says and say
[1:18:09] if he says it's the eichmann case it's
[1:18:11] the eichmann case
[1:18:14] if he says it's the two witnesses it's
[1:18:15] the two witnesses because brother
[1:18:17] branham will tell you
[1:18:18] amen what's happened before and he'll
[1:18:20] tell you what's happened after
[1:18:22] but he's told to be mute on what's
[1:18:24] happening now because he's not allowed
[1:18:26] to tell the third pull it'll be a total
[1:18:28] secret so he can show you verse 29
[1:18:31] and he can show you verse 31 but the
[1:18:33] bride's got to catch the mystery
[1:18:35] in verse 30.
[1:18:38] he'll show you the second pool
[1:18:42] he'll show you what the second pool is
[1:18:44] he'll tell you what's coming next to the
[1:18:46] two witnesses
[1:18:49] but he won't tell you what the third
[1:18:51] pool is
[1:18:52] when it comes time to tell the third
[1:18:54] pool
[1:18:56] he starts telling stories
[1:18:59] because he can't tell it he can tell you
[1:19:01] what the first pull was he can tell you
[1:19:02] what the second pool was
[1:19:04] and then when he gets done with that he
[1:19:05] says now and the seven city says now i
[1:19:07] feel
[1:19:07] to stop right here but he says remember
[1:19:10] that vision i had about seven years ago
[1:19:12] of that big tent in the little room and
[1:19:14] remember the pool and remember remember
[1:19:15] the baby shoe remember the sword in the
[1:19:17] hand
[1:19:19] he said now that tent that 10 when i saw
[1:19:22] that 10
[1:19:22] and those going in one by one in that
[1:19:24] little room and they're coming out
[1:19:25] changed amen
[1:19:26] and the pillar of fire was down in there
[1:19:28] he said that what says that will be your
[1:19:30] third pool
[1:19:33] that will be your third pool and you'll
[1:19:35] tell it to no one.
[1:19:38] then he's on in sabino canyon he lifts
[1:19:40] up his hands the sword hits his hand
[1:19:42] somewhere early in 1963
[1:19:46] and he's nervous he looks at that and
[1:19:49] the voice says that's the same
[1:19:50] the sword of the king he says oh a king
[1:19:52] so he said not a king's sword
[1:19:55] the king's sword and he says he knew
[1:19:58] it was the word coming into his hand
[1:20:00] because he's a prophet he's got to give
[1:20:02] out the word
[1:20:02] amen because brother brenham told us
[1:20:04] that mighty angel come down with a
[1:20:06] little bo
[1:20:06] tore off the seals amen sent it down to
[1:20:09] the seventh angel that's on earth
[1:20:10] and he turns around and gives it to the
[1:20:12] people which is the word in the hand
[1:20:14] so the word come to the prophet's hand
[1:20:16] but the word coming to the prophet's
[1:20:18] hand wasn't to stay in the prophet's
[1:20:20] hand but he was to give it to the people
[1:20:24] and he says now when he's holding the
[1:20:26] sword the voice says
[1:20:27] this is your third pool
[1:20:32] that will be seven years ago but at the
[1:20:34] end of a seven year cycle
[1:20:35] now we've come to completion that will
[1:20:38] be this is
[1:20:40] and it'll be a total mystery where's the
[1:20:42] mystery between matthew 24
[1:20:46] 29 and 31
[1:20:49] he'll come to the sixth seal and he'll
[1:20:51] explain under the sixth seal when the
[1:20:53] sixth seal and the sixth trump would
[1:20:54] open the same time
[1:20:55] persecution brought broke out on the
[1:20:57] jews so now you know you're under the
[1:20:59] sixth seal
[1:21:02] and he'll tell you where that's at then
[1:21:03] he'll tell you also
[1:21:05] under the sixth seal it's two witnesses
[1:21:08] through the tribulation period that'll
[1:21:10] bring plagues down on gentiles
[1:21:12] is that right but he's not going to tell
[1:21:16] you
[1:21:16] what happens in between because that's
[1:21:20] the mystery
[1:21:21] for the bride to catch
[1:21:24] oh i love the word
[1:21:28] so much i'm just gonna
[1:21:31] drop something in here
[1:21:35] just for fun
[1:21:42] brother branham takes the sixth
[1:21:47] seal
[1:21:51] and the sixth trumpet
[1:21:55] it says they open at the same time
[1:22:00] but he shows that the sixth seal
[1:22:04] opened in egypt and he also
[1:22:07] says that that was the trumpets calling
[1:22:10] them
[1:22:10] out to the homeland back in egypt the
[1:22:14] exodus journey
[1:22:15] so when brother graham says the sixth
[1:22:17] seal and the six trumpet open the same
[1:22:18] time
[1:22:19] it doesn't mean that they can't open
[1:22:20] again because they've opened before
[1:22:24] but brother brims in his ministry under
[1:22:26] his ministry
[1:22:27] under the seventh seal ministry the
[1:22:28] ministry of the end time he's pointing
[1:22:30] to this opening
[1:22:32] that was happening in his lifetime so
[1:22:34] the 1606 trumpet
[1:22:36] amen and we know it's the second woe
[1:22:41] which is world war ii
[1:22:46] world war ii starts in september 1
[1:22:50] 1939. right
[1:22:55] but on january 24th
[1:22:59] 1939 you have a massive earthquake in
[1:23:03] chile an 8.3 earthquake
[1:23:05] so the year opens with an earthquake
[1:23:08] because there's an earthquake at the
[1:23:10] opening of the sixth seal
[1:23:12] not a little earthquake not a 4.495 an
[1:23:14] 8.3
[1:23:16] earthquake in chile a major earthquake
[1:23:18] the
[1:23:19] year 1939 starts with an earthquake
[1:23:22] because you're going into the
[1:23:24] sixth seal and then world war ii goes
[1:23:28] till september
[1:23:30] i think this is amazing second
[1:23:33] 1945. that
[1:23:36] equals six years
[1:23:40] exactly why
[1:23:43] why was jesus on the cross six hours
[1:23:46] why was world war ii six years
[1:23:49] why because it's the sixth seal
[1:23:53] it's everything's laying there for us to
[1:23:55] see the pattern
[1:23:56] here and here and here and here
[1:24:00] and brother branham has no problem
[1:24:02] seeing in egypt
[1:24:03] seeing it in calvary seeing it in jacob
[1:24:05] amen and seeing it in his day
[1:24:08] and then he can see in the tribulation
[1:24:10] period he said after the rapture of the
[1:24:12] church when the bride's done gone
[1:24:13] amen he says then these two witnesses
[1:24:16] will open up that sixth seal
[1:24:18] that he says but he already told us the
[1:24:20] 60 open with the sixth trumpet it was
[1:24:22] world war ii persecution to the jews so
[1:24:24] is it open or is it not open
[1:24:28] is it open or not because he says it
[1:24:30] opened up amen in that pre-tribulation
[1:24:33] amateur tribulation to the jews
[1:24:34] so the sixth seal opened with the sixth
[1:24:36] trumpet but he says those two witnesses
[1:24:39] amen moses and elijah to the jews
[1:24:41] they'll open up the sixth seal
[1:24:46] who opens it
[1:24:49] let's just put it this way like he says
[1:24:51] prophets
[1:24:52] the six seals opened by prophets brother
[1:24:54] branham opens it to the gentiles
[1:24:56] them to open it to the jews
[1:25:01] there's no problem with that see
[1:25:04] i want to do two other numbers and i'll
[1:25:06] stop
[1:25:08] in 1960 when in 1960 i don't know what
[1:25:12] day 1960.
[1:25:15] yeah it's may i remember now
[1:25:19] may 1960 now if you remember
[1:25:23] 1960 is an important year 1960 at the
[1:25:27] end of the year is when brother bannon's
[1:25:28] going to start preaching the revelation
[1:25:30] of jesus christ he's going to start
[1:25:31] going into the book of revelation and
[1:25:33] really interpreting the book of
[1:25:35] revelation
[1:25:36] all right so 1960 is a big year and in
[1:25:38] 1960
[1:25:40] brother benham shows how the ten toes
[1:25:44] come together
[1:25:45] on the two feet the east and west this
[1:25:48] all happens in 1960.
[1:25:50] they decide to make an agreement amen
[1:25:54] they're going to try to bring peace and
[1:25:55] bring some resolutions that'll move
[1:25:57] peace and in the cold war
[1:25:58] amen so there's a 10 nation committee on
[1:26:01] disarmament and they bring five nations
[1:26:03] from the western
[1:26:04] uh uh western nations five from the
[1:26:06] eastern nations
[1:26:07] and they're going to come together and
[1:26:09] all of this is transpiring we went
[1:26:10] through it carefully all through 1960
[1:26:12] early in 1960
[1:26:14] and he says look at those two big toes
[1:26:16] the two big toes was eisenhower and
[1:26:18] khrushchev
[1:26:19] eisenhower means iron khrushchev means
[1:26:21] clay and brother brown says see
[1:26:23] the iron and the clay they won't mix
[1:26:25] together because the scripture says
[1:26:28] they'll intermingle but they won't mix
[1:26:31] so he says they won't mix but what were
[1:26:32] they trying to do through this
[1:26:34] committee they were trying to mix
[1:26:36] together
[1:26:37] eisenhower and khrushchev were becoming
[1:26:39] friends khrushchev had been invited over
[1:26:41] to
[1:26:42] earlier in the year had been invited or
[1:26:44] no i'm sorry late in 1959 had been
[1:26:46] invited
[1:26:47] over to the usa they showed him a good
[1:26:49] time they started this peace deal
[1:26:50] then right after the first of the year
[1:26:52] starting in march and then they started
[1:26:54] this 10 nation committee on disarmament
[1:26:56] they went from march to april 29th and
[1:26:58] then they had drawn up plans
[1:27:00] then there was going to be a peace
[1:27:01] summit starting i believe i didn't
[1:27:03] believe it was may
[1:27:04] 17th there was going to be a peace
[1:27:05] summit and may 17th in paris
[1:27:07] where they got back together eisenhower
[1:27:09] and khrushchev
[1:27:10] but just between that first session
[1:27:14] of the ten nation committee on
[1:27:16] disarmament and the peace summit in
[1:27:18] paris
[1:27:19] the russians the soviets shoot down a
[1:27:21] u-2 spy plane on may 1st
[1:27:24] and when they found out u.s was still
[1:27:26] spying on the soviet union
[1:27:28] khrushchev was infuriated it broke down
[1:27:31] all the agreement it broke down the
[1:27:33] the peace process he comes may 17th and
[1:27:35] he blast it was either 16th or 17th he
[1:27:38] comes to paris and blasts eisenhower
[1:27:40] blasts america calls for a public
[1:27:43] apology
[1:27:44] and the talks crumble they try to start
[1:27:46] it up after that it crumbles
[1:27:47] and from that point on there's never
[1:27:49] been a ten nation committee on this
[1:27:51] armament
[1:27:53] there's never been five west and five
[1:27:55] east come together with two big toes
[1:27:57] where their names mean iron and clay
[1:28:00] it only happened then and it hasn't
[1:28:02] happened since
[1:28:07] that crumbles when may
[1:28:10] 17th may
[1:28:14] 22nd
[1:28:20] may 22nd
[1:28:23] is the largest earthquake ever recorded
[1:28:26] in the history of mankind
[1:28:30] why because whenever there's a prophet
[1:28:33] on the scene
[1:28:34] and things are opening there's
[1:28:35] earthquakes
[1:28:38] after the ten toes are declared
[1:28:41] they make themselves visible the two big
[1:28:42] toes khrushchev
[1:28:44] and eisenhower after all that the
[1:28:46] largest earthquake ever recorded
[1:28:49] in history is recorded the great chilean
[1:28:51] earthquake at 9.5
[1:28:57] and after that earthquake
[1:29:01] brother branham then he sees khrushchev
[1:29:03] in in
[1:29:04] october 12th of that same year take a
[1:29:06] shoe off and beat his shoe
[1:29:08] at the u.n and brother bram said see so
[1:29:10] that the world wouldn't miss it
[1:29:11] he beat a shoe on the table and the
[1:29:14] world missed it
[1:29:16] why a shoe because he said he's drawing
[1:29:18] attention to the feet so that the world
[1:29:20] wouldn't miss it we've come to the feet
[1:29:22] of this image gentile world powers
[1:29:24] is now at the end of the toes
[1:29:27] it's finished and when the when the
[1:29:29] talks disintegrated
[1:29:31] there was a largest earthquake ever
[1:29:33] recorded and meant by humans ever
[1:29:35] recorded
[1:29:36] on the face of the earth was recorded
[1:29:38] right then
[1:29:39] and by the end of the year brother
[1:29:41] branham now is moving into the book of
[1:29:43] revelations
[1:29:44] to what to start unveiling the book of
[1:29:46] revelation
[1:29:48] and he keeps moving through the book of
[1:29:50] revelation
[1:29:52] then the second largest earthquake that
[1:29:55] was ever recorded
[1:29:58] takes place good friday 1964
[1:30:03] when there's a prophet on the earth who
[1:30:04] takes a little stone and throws it in
[1:30:06] the air
[1:30:07] starts a whirlwind that goes up and
[1:30:09] nearly sinks alaska
[1:30:12] what had happened between 1960 and 1964.
[1:30:16] between 1960 and 1964 brother branham
[1:30:19] moves into
[1:30:20] the book of revelations and goes all the
[1:30:22] way through to the end of the seven
[1:30:24] seals
[1:30:25] and you have the largest earthquake ever
[1:30:28] recorded in human history
[1:30:29] at the beginning and you have the second
[1:30:31] largest earthquake ever recorded in
[1:30:33] human history
[1:30:34] at the end i think god is drawing
[1:30:37] attention
[1:30:39] all of these things are for a reason
[1:30:41] there's earthquakes all through the
[1:30:42] bible and they all mean something
[1:30:44] friends
[1:30:44] and many times under the seals amen
[1:30:47] under the sixth seal when there was an
[1:30:48] earthquake
[1:30:49] there was a great earthquake when jesus
[1:30:51] died and the veil was rent
[1:30:53] so what so you could see he's moved from
[1:30:56] the churches
[1:30:58] now there's another earthquake that
[1:31:00] breaks the roman seal
[1:31:01] where is he going he's going from one
[1:31:03] place to another
[1:31:04] he's moving temples he's no longer in
[1:31:08] this temple
[1:31:09] but now he's in this temple
[1:31:12] it's marking a transition it's marking a
[1:31:14] change
[1:31:15] now he's no longer amen he's no longer
[1:31:19] in the churches he's no longer in the
[1:31:20] church systems but now he's in the bride
[1:31:25] and the veil was rent and brother bam
[1:31:27] comes and he preaches several messages
[1:31:29] on this
[1:31:30] and he starts showing god's provided
[1:31:31] place of worship and things like that he
[1:31:33] starts shut
[1:31:33] that veil of denomination is now rent
[1:31:36] amen move beyond that veil
[1:31:38] it's re it's open in plain view that
[1:31:40] that's not the place to find him anymore
[1:31:42] that was okay in a previous age but now
[1:31:45] there's been the second crucifixion of
[1:31:47] jesus christ
[1:31:48] the word has come the word has stood the
[1:31:51] test
[1:31:51] the word has been proved perfect and the
[1:31:53] word has been crucified
[1:31:56] and when you see the second crucifixion
[1:31:58] of jesus christ
[1:31:59] and now you recognize he's not there
[1:32:02] him and he's moved to another temple and
[1:32:05] now
[1:32:06] he's in his bride
[1:32:09] and now you know the proper place of
[1:32:11] worship is in him
[1:32:12] and i'm in him and he's in me and now
[1:32:15] we've found the proper place of worship
[1:32:18] which is what the bride knows in
[1:32:20] revelations 11 verse 1 and 2
[1:32:22] the proper place of worship and the
[1:32:24] altar she knows the measurements of it
[1:32:27] because she's been given a measuring
[1:32:29] tool
[1:32:31] it all links together friends

[1:33:56] were for choosing of a bride
[1:33:57] eleazar fetching a bride for the father
[1:34:00] son
[1:34:01] isaac and his second scripture was
[1:34:04] the third one of the seven vile angels

[1:34:20] civilization
[1:34:23] and religions followed civilization at
[1:34:25] the end of civilization
[1:34:26] and at the end of religion there's a
[1:34:30] vile angel standing in los angeles that
[1:34:32] had already thrown a stone in the air
[1:34:34] and created the first earthquake on good

[1:34:46] know if the lord ever tells me i'll let
[1:34:47] you know

[1:35:06] a giant earthquake and he said
[1:35:07] california is going to break off a huge
[1:35:09] second break off and slip into the ocean
[1:35:11] and want a giant earthquake amen because
[1:35:14] when the seventh vial was poured out
[1:35:16] over in revelation 16 there's an
[1:35:18] earthquake amen
[1:35:20] an earthquake such as was not since men
[1:35:21] were upon the face of the earth so
[1:35:23] mighty and so great was the earthquake
[1:35:26] what happened when brother man threw
[1:35:28] that stone he was what do you say
[1:35:30] judgment striking the west coast he says
[1:35:33] now we're under judgments

[1:35:38] he's a prophet oh for the gentiles open
[1:35:40] the sixth seal
[1:35:41] and he's calling judgments to strike
[1:35:43] judgments to strike and he's also the
[1:35:44] seventh vile angel pouring out the
[1:35:46] seventh vial
[1:35:47] showing that there's going to be another
[1:35:49] earthquake strike

[1:35:58] something else

[1:36:02] if we can never gather ourselves back
[1:36:04] together
[1:36:05] let's go to revelation
[1:36:13] 17.
[1:36:23] now i know there's a lot of details but
[1:36:26] they're all telling the same story
[1:36:29] if we could just let that tell us the
[1:36:30] same story revelation 17
[1:36:32] 1 and there came one of the seven angels
[1:36:35] which had the seven vials
[1:36:37] huh wonder which one this is
[1:36:42] and there came one of the seven angels
[1:36:43] which had the seven vials and talked

[1:36:48] the judgment of the great
[1:36:50] that sitteth upon many waters

[1:37:08] vatican city be destroyed
[1:37:11] a nuclear bomb russia will drop a bomb

[1:37:15] how do you know that who told you that
[1:37:20] where did you hear that you didn't hear
[1:37:23] that
[1:37:23] there's only one place to hear that and
[1:37:25] that's through brother branham
[1:37:27] who in the bible shows you the
[1:37:29] destruction of the
[1:37:32] who shows you the destruction of the
[1:37:33] one of the vile
[1:37:35] angels shows you the destruction of the

[1:37:43] the
[1:37:44] it's babylon it's babylon he said in
[1:37:47] babylon will be destroyed
[1:37:49] and he comes over here in chapter 18.
[1:37:56] verse 9 and the kings of the earth who
[1:37:58] have committed fornication and lived
[1:38:00] deliciously with her shall bewail her
[1:38:02] and lay them in her
[1:38:03] when they shall see the smoke of her
[1:38:04] burning standing afar off for fear of
[1:38:06] her torment saying alas
[1:38:08] last that great city babylon the mighty
[1:38:10] city for in one hour is thy judgment

[1:38:14] off fear of torment
[1:38:16] from nuclear fallout from a nuclear bomb
[1:38:19] that fell on the vatican and her
[1:38:20] judgment came in one
[1:38:22] hour where else have you heard that
[1:38:27] who in the bible shows you the
[1:38:29] destruction of the great
[1:38:31] it's one of the seven angels having one
[1:38:34] of the seven
[1:38:35] vials i wonder what
[1:38:38] number you would attribute to that one
[1:38:42] furthermore he goes on
[1:38:46] in chapter 18 verse 20
[1:38:51] it says rejoice over her thou heaven and
[1:38:53] ye holy apostles and prophets and god of
[1:38:55] the vengeance
[1:38:56] and a mighty angel took up a stone like
[1:38:58] a great millstone and cast it into the
[1:39:00] sea
[1:39:00] saying thus was violent shall that great
[1:39:02] city babylon be thrown down
[1:39:04] and shall be found no more at all he
[1:39:07] shows you the destruction of the vatican
[1:39:09] and the destruction of los angeles like
[1:39:11] a millstone cast into the sea
[1:39:14] who told you how that was going to
[1:39:16] happen it was the prophet of god
[1:39:18] but he was he had many titles but his
[1:39:21] greatest title was the seventh angel
[1:39:25] and one of the seven angels having the
[1:39:27] seven vials is the one who shows you the
[1:39:29] destruction
[1:39:29] of the and also shows you amen the
[1:39:32] destruction
[1:39:33] of babylon amen that's cast into the sea
[1:39:35] like a millstone
[1:39:39] amen friends this
[1:39:42] this whole bible is to be open to the
[1:39:45] bride
[1:39:46] open it and open it and open it up
[1:39:50] so he he goes through the series of
[1:39:53] earthquakes
[1:39:55] but he has poured out another vial
[1:39:58] in 1965 in los angeles in choosing of a
[1:40:02] bride
[1:40:03] and that will be fulfilled
[1:40:07] it will happen praise be to god
[1:40:10] and the vatican will be judged by a
[1:40:12] nuclear bomb
[1:40:14] and mystery babylon los angeles all the
[1:40:17] filth that has moved all the way to the
[1:40:19] west coast
[1:40:19] and bumped all the way into los angeles
[1:40:21] he says now this is the headquarters of
[1:40:24] satan
[1:40:25] that's what babylon is the headquarters
[1:40:27] of satan los angeles has become the
[1:40:29] headquarters of satan
[1:40:30] has become a babylon well you can't have
[1:40:34] two brother chad he said the vatican's
[1:40:36] babylon
[1:40:36] who says you can't have two where does
[1:40:39] the bible say you can't have two
[1:40:43] amen you have the religious system amen
[1:40:46] and then you have the vile outcropping
[1:40:48] that's coming out of los angeles
[1:40:50] through hollywood that's polluting the
[1:40:52] whole world
[1:40:55] and who showed you the destruction of it
[1:40:59] what you could say brother branham but
[1:41:01] if you're going to be scriptural
[1:41:03] you'll say one of the seven vile angels
[1:41:06] is who told me that if you want to be
[1:41:09] scriptural
[1:41:12] praise be to god i love the lord
[1:41:15] and i love his word can i go through one
[1:41:19] more thing
[1:41:22] praise god you know
[1:41:26] i love you guys but i'm so full of this
[1:41:29] i it's not brand new stuff but it's just
[1:41:32] clearer you know it's the same thing
[1:41:34] clear it's
[1:41:35] it's god is it's like he's focusing the
[1:41:37] binoculars you know you see two you see
[1:41:39] i i see 21 angels
[1:41:43] right brother graham says he says you
[1:41:46] three
[1:41:46] see three gods father son and holy ghost
[1:41:49] he said you just need to dial in the
[1:41:50] binoculars so they become one
[1:41:53] and i see three angels in the church
[1:41:55] there's seven ages church ages
[1:41:57] seven violent angels seven trumpet
[1:41:58] angels i see 21 angels
[1:42:00] it might be time to take the binoculars
[1:42:02] and just dial them down
[1:42:04] a little bit amen
[1:42:07] praise be to god amen there's nothing
[1:42:10] wrong with the binoculars and there's
[1:42:12] nothing wrong with what we're looking at
[1:42:13] but we didn't realize we've had it out
[1:42:15] of focus
[1:42:16] and all it takes is just a little
[1:42:17] adjustment and that little adjustment is
[1:42:19] the adjustment that brother branham told
[1:42:21] us himself
[1:42:23] when we adjust it according to the
[1:42:24] message all of a sudden it gets clearer
[1:42:27] i see now what we're supposed to see
[1:42:31] praise god let's go back to matthew 24.
[1:42:36] let's read a couple scriptures
[1:42:51] so matthew 24
[1:42:55] we went down through one we showed the
[1:42:57] questions in verse three
[1:42:58] three questions he goes down and
[1:43:00] starting in verse four he goes down and
[1:43:02] answers
[1:43:03] through ten uh the five seals
[1:43:08] and then he picks up the sixth seal over
[1:43:11] in verse 29.
[1:43:13] but there's something that happens
[1:43:15] between that that brother is going to
[1:43:16] talk about
[1:43:17] he's going to show us and we'll pick it
[1:43:18] up in verse 15.
[1:43:22] it says when you therefore shall see the
[1:43:23] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[1:43:26] daniel the prophet stand in the holy
[1:43:28] place whoso readeth let him understand
[1:43:32] then let them which be in judea flee
[1:43:34] into the mountains
[1:43:35] let him which is in the housetop not
[1:43:37] come down to take anything out of his
[1:43:39] house
[1:43:39] neither let him which is in the field
[1:43:41] return back to take his clothes
[1:43:43] and woe to them that are with child unto
[1:43:45] them that give suck in those days
[1:43:47] but pray your flight be not in the
[1:43:49] winter neither on the sabbath day for
[1:43:52] there shall be great tribulations such
[1:43:54] as was not since the beginning of the
[1:43:55] world
[1:43:56] to this time nor ever shall be
[1:44:00] and except those days shall be shortened
[1:44:02] there shall be no flesh saved
[1:44:03] but for the elect's sake those days
[1:44:05] shall be shortened
[1:44:07] so you come to this period and he says
[1:44:09] there shall be great tribulation
[1:44:11] and whenever he makes that all of a
[1:44:12] sudden you're tipped off to the sixth
[1:44:14] seal
[1:44:15] you're tipped off to the sixth seal and
[1:44:18] so now let's go over to luke 21
[1:44:21] and read from luke 21.
[1:44:34] luke 21 verse 20.
[1:44:43] and when you shall see jerusalem
[1:44:45] compassed with armies then know that the
[1:44:47] desolation
[1:44:48] thereof is nigh then let him let them
[1:44:51] which are in judea flee to the mountains
[1:44:54] and let them which are in the midst of
[1:44:55] it depart out and let let not them that
[1:44:57] are in the countries enter therein too
[1:45:00] for these be the days of vengeance that
[1:45:02] all things which are written may be
[1:45:04] fulfilled
[1:45:05] but woe unto them that are with child
[1:45:07] and to them that give suck in those days
[1:45:08] for there shall be great distress in the
[1:45:10] land
[1:45:11] and wrath upon the people and they shall
[1:45:13] fall by the edge of the sword and shall
[1:45:15] be led away captive unto all nations and
[1:45:17] jerusalem
[1:45:18] shall be trodden down of the gentiles
[1:45:20] until the times of the gentiles be
[1:45:22] fulfilled
[1:45:23] and there shall be signs in the sun and
[1:45:25] the moon and in the stars and upon the
[1:45:27] earth distress of nations
[1:45:29] with perplexity the sea and the waves
[1:45:30] roaring men's hearts failing them for
[1:45:33] fear for looking after those things
[1:45:35] which are coming on the earth
[1:45:36] for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[1:45:38] and then shall they see the son of man
[1:45:40] coming in a cloud with power and great
[1:45:42] glory
[1:45:43] when these things begin to come to pass
[1:45:45] then look up
[1:45:46] lift up your heads for your redemption
[1:45:48] draw us nigh
[1:45:50] so we've read these two scriptures they
[1:45:53] tie together
[1:45:55] brother branham has asked a question and
[1:45:57] questions and answers in 1964.
[1:46:00] and in 19 in this questions and answers
[1:46:03] question number 236
[1:46:04] says what does this mean matthew 24 19
[1:46:07] woe unto them that are with child and to
[1:46:09] them that give suck in those days
[1:46:12] it says matthew now matthew 24 19 jesus
[1:46:15] had
[1:46:15] had been asking three questions in these
[1:46:17] questions was that when will the time be
[1:46:19] that there won't be one stone left on
[1:46:21] another
[1:46:22] what will be the sign of the coming of
[1:46:23] the end of the world and
[1:46:25] the three different questions he was
[1:46:27] asked and he answered it in three
[1:46:28] different ways answering each question
[1:46:31] when will it be when there won't be one
[1:46:33] stone upon another and what will be the
[1:46:34] sign of your coming
[1:46:36] what is the sign of the end of the world
[1:46:38] and he answers it in three different
[1:46:39] ways he tells them
[1:46:41] when the time will come when there won't
[1:46:43] be one stone on another
[1:46:44] what will be the sign of his coming then
[1:46:46] at the end of the world and many times
[1:46:48] if you don't watch closely now
[1:46:50] how he answers you'll get it mixed up
[1:46:52] and throw it all in one time
[1:46:53] and then you're all mixed up now further
[1:46:57] down he says that's
[1:46:57] under the time that there won't be one
[1:46:59] stone left upon another
[1:47:01] woe into them that are with child and to
[1:47:03] them that give suck in those days
[1:47:04] because a mother that is with child it
[1:47:06] would be hard for her to run to those
[1:47:08] that are giving suck to their babies to
[1:47:09] pack them
[1:47:10] because they had to come from jerusalem
[1:47:12] out of the city and up into the
[1:47:13] mountains of judea
[1:47:14] and now i could just stay all morning on
[1:47:16] that one thing there
[1:47:18] just to make it clear wow
[1:47:21] that's a big statement but i'm just
[1:47:23] going to try to hit the high spots that
[1:47:25] i can
[1:47:25] and get it to the people and then go to
[1:47:28] the next question
[1:47:29] now jesus had told them when you see
[1:47:31] jerusalem compassed about
[1:47:33] i went to that in luke that was luke 21
[1:47:35] 20.
[1:47:36] jesus is tying that together with
[1:47:39] matthew 24.
[1:47:41] now jesus had told them when you see
[1:47:43] jerusalem compassed about with
[1:47:44] army then let him that's in the field
[1:47:46] don't return back into the city get a
[1:47:48] coat
[1:47:49] take anything out of his house don't
[1:47:50] return back into the city at all but
[1:47:52] flee into judea for there will be a time
[1:47:54] of trouble not since the world began
[1:47:56] and that all came to pass in the days
[1:47:58] when the roman general titus besieged
[1:48:00] jerusalem
[1:48:01] burnt the city there was and there's
[1:48:04] only and killed the people till the
[1:48:06] blood flew out of the gates
[1:48:07] and rolled out and out the street he
[1:48:10] beseeched it
[1:48:10] don't know just how many years it was
[1:48:12] that he just took his armies and came up
[1:48:14] and just camped right around the city
[1:48:16] and even the people the women boiled
[1:48:19] their own children and eat them
[1:48:20] eat the bark of the trees the grass off
[1:48:22] the ground that was for rejecting the
[1:48:24] word
[1:48:25] that's what caused it so you want to
[1:48:28] know what caused titus
[1:48:30] taking jerusalem they rejected the word
[1:48:35] and it was a horrible it was a horrible
[1:48:38] act in history a horrible battle and a
[1:48:40] horrible scene
[1:48:41] that took place there but because in
[1:48:44] jerusalem
[1:48:45] was the ministry of jesus christ and in
[1:48:48] jerusalem
[1:48:49] he was crucified and so the wrath of god
[1:48:52] was poured out
[1:48:53] because they had an opportunity like no
[1:48:55] other place on the earth had an
[1:48:57] opportunity
[1:48:58] there was no other place that had the
[1:48:59] opportunity they had
[1:49:01] and you want to know why russia is going
[1:49:02] to drop atomic bombs on america
[1:49:04] because no other nation had the
[1:49:06] opportunity that america had while the
[1:49:08] prophet was here
[1:49:08] and they rejected jesus christ and the
[1:49:11] son of man ministry
[1:49:12] and there's nothing left for america to
[1:49:14] become ashes and debris
[1:49:16] border to border coast to coast for what
[1:49:19] rejecting jesus christ the word
[1:49:23] praise be to god he says now
[1:49:27] those who had received the word now
[1:49:30] listen
[1:49:31] those who had received the word as
[1:49:34] joseph as that great historian writes
[1:49:37] he says now those people the reason pray
[1:49:40] that your flight
[1:49:40] not be in the wintertime judea was
[1:49:43] snowbound
[1:49:44] see christmas now how was how was jesus
[1:49:48] born up there and then snowbound hills
[1:49:49] pray that your flight be not in
[1:49:51] wintertime
[1:49:51] neither on the sabbath day because on
[1:49:53] the sabbath day the gates were shut
[1:49:55] and they'd be caught right in their trap
[1:49:56] if titus got there on friday afternoon
[1:49:58] there was besiege in there for the
[1:49:59] sabbath
[1:50:00] because the doors was closed the gates
[1:50:02] was closed on the sabbath
[1:50:03] and don't open there's no coming and
[1:50:05] going out of the city on the sabbath day
[1:50:07] and now you see what happened woe unto
[1:50:10] them that are with child and to them
[1:50:11] that give suck in those days
[1:50:12] because fleeing and running and
[1:50:14] according to the history there wasn't
[1:50:16] one of them that believed in jesus and
[1:50:18] believed the word
[1:50:18] but what was watching for that to happen
[1:50:22] and they escaped went from jerusalem
[1:50:24] into judea
[1:50:25] and fled for their lives not one of them
[1:50:26] because they were worn by their shepherd
[1:50:28] and was watching for that hour to come
[1:50:30] when they heard titus was coming they
[1:50:32] took off run for their lives and got out
[1:50:34] of the city
[1:50:36] now this sounds like history but it's
[1:50:38] not history
[1:50:40] remember everything that has been will
[1:50:42] be
[1:50:44] i i remember last year i was in poland
[1:50:47] for meetings and
[1:50:48] they took me over to auschwitz
[1:50:50] concentration camp
[1:50:52] and that happened under the sixth seal
[1:50:55] right and
[1:50:59] and i was in auschwitz and you see all
[1:51:01] the horrible things that happened to
[1:51:03] human beings
[1:51:05] and it was somber and they take you
[1:51:07] through and explain this and this and
[1:51:08] what they do here and here
[1:51:10] and as i was leaving auschwitz
[1:51:14] there was a thought that was moving me
[1:51:16] more than what i saw in auschwitz
[1:51:19] and the thought that was moving me was
[1:51:22] that
[1:51:23] everybody thinks this is history and
[1:51:26] they don't realize
[1:51:27] this is the future they made it a museum
[1:51:31] they look back at the atrocities and
[1:51:34] they want to keep it going there's a
[1:51:35] memorial so that this will never happen
[1:51:37] again
[1:51:37] but they don't realize amen the same
[1:51:40] events that cause that to happen are the
[1:51:42] same events that's taking place daily
[1:51:44] around the globe
[1:51:44] when they reject the word that the bride
[1:51:46] is carrying
[1:51:50] and what they think is history is the
[1:51:52] future
[1:51:53] for a huge number of people
[1:51:56] because there's nothing that's now is
[1:51:58] that hasn't been before
[1:52:00] and what is shall be again amen these
[1:52:03] things repeat under a sixth seal
[1:52:05] and a sixth seal and a sixth seal and a
[1:52:08] sixth seal
[1:52:10] prophet of god there was a sixth seal
[1:52:12] open in his lifetime and he explained it
[1:52:13] to us and the demons coming out and the
[1:52:15] persecution
[1:52:16] and throwing the stone and earthquake
[1:52:18] and all these things
[1:52:22] but he says those two prophets are going
[1:52:23] to open up a sixth seal
[1:52:26] they certainly will it's going to be
[1:52:29] horrible
[1:52:31] everything that's been shall be again so
[1:52:34] when we look back at this don't look at
[1:52:35] it by what's been
[1:52:37] this is going on now
[1:52:40] brother brahm says the whole nation had
[1:52:42] to be brought into judgment
[1:52:43] because it happened about 80 70 when the
[1:52:46] great roman general titus besieged
[1:52:47] jerusalem about 80 70 with his army from
[1:52:49] rome
[1:52:50] and there they paid the price for
[1:52:51] rejecting him
[1:52:56] now
[1:52:58] brother braham goes on to say in uniting
[1:53:00] times and sign
[1:53:02] he said before titus united his armies
[1:53:05] together
[1:53:06] israel united themselves together and
[1:53:08] banded themselves
[1:53:09] and they would not believe jesus to be
[1:53:11] the messiah
[1:53:13] before before titus
[1:53:17] united his armies together the religious
[1:53:20] system had to unite against jesus christ
[1:53:24] what has been will be again
[1:53:28] they rejected him and turned him out and
[1:53:30] crucified him
[1:53:32] you might say well i don't reject jesus
[1:53:34] christ
[1:53:35] if you reject the bride of jesus christ
[1:53:37] you reject jesus christ because
[1:53:40] she is
[1:53:44] he was the word made manifest she is the
[1:53:46] word made
[1:53:48] manifest she is him
[1:53:54] how uniting themselves together to
[1:53:58] reject the message of the hour
[1:54:00] they had to do that and when they did
[1:54:02] that that national sign come in
[1:54:04] the nations began to unite themselves
[1:54:06] together and titus brought this great
[1:54:07] army of romans and greeks encompassed
[1:54:09] the walls of jerusalem
[1:54:10] pin those people in there now and they
[1:54:12] starve to death they ate the bark from
[1:54:14] the trees
[1:54:15] josephus the great historian tells us
[1:54:17] they eat the grass off the ground
[1:54:19] they even bored one another's children
[1:54:21] and eat it see as they were met mad
[1:54:23] people
[1:54:23] and when they finally titus he was
[1:54:25] setting back up on the hills and around
[1:54:27] jerusalem and
[1:54:28] those people in there thought that they
[1:54:29] were doing the will of god when they saw
[1:54:31] those armies marching in
[1:54:33] they had refused to hear that great
[1:54:34] master lord jesus tell them that
[1:54:37] there wasn't one of them christians
[1:54:39] caught in there for they saw the sign
[1:54:41] and moved see they said let them that's
[1:54:44] on the housetop come not down or him
[1:54:46] that's in the field go
[1:54:47] back take any coat but flee into judea
[1:54:50] pray your flight be not in the winter
[1:54:51] time or the sabbath
[1:54:53] because the in the winter time the hills
[1:54:56] will be full of snow and the sabbath the
[1:54:58] doors will be closed and the gate that
[1:54:59] they caught in the condition
[1:55:01] we want to get on that pretty soon how
[1:55:03] god does those things
[1:55:05] lord willing now notice they prayed now
[1:55:09] they wouldn't be that not be that way
[1:55:11] jesus told them to pray for that and
[1:55:12] they never caught one of them in there
[1:55:14] they were gone because they looked at
[1:55:15] the sign and they were gone
[1:55:17] that's all there was to it oh how the
[1:55:20] churches today ought to see the sign of
[1:55:22] the time that we're living in
[1:55:23] flee as hard as you can to calvary for
[1:55:25] life not in some church but to jesus
[1:55:28] christ
[1:55:28] unite yourselves with him and not with
[1:55:30] some organization or some
[1:55:32] church creed unite with christ and be
[1:55:34] sure that it's him
[1:55:36] that's good advice unite with christ but
[1:55:38] be sure it's him
[1:55:40] what is him who is he he's the anointed
[1:55:43] word made flesh in your day
[1:55:47] you can't just take anything you've got
[1:55:48] to be positive that it's him
[1:55:50] what a time of union
[1:55:54] then i'm going to read just a couple
[1:55:56] more to set the stage and then i want to
[1:55:57] explain this
[1:55:58] and and god being misunderstood from 61
[1:56:01] brother brahm says
[1:56:02] it's a question brother bantam and
[1:56:05] daniel the 11th chapter of the 31st
[1:56:06] verse teaches us of the day
[1:56:08] take away the daily sacrifice and the
[1:56:10] abomination that make desolation
[1:56:12] would you please explain that what these
[1:56:13] are
[1:56:15] he said oh he says the 70 weeks of
[1:56:18] daniel
[1:56:19] and i might just say this your most
[1:56:20] precious brother that signed us here
[1:56:22] which is a dear friend to all of us the
[1:56:24] abomination that make a desolation
[1:56:26] in matthew 24 spoke of the abomination
[1:56:28] means filthiness that maketh desolation
[1:56:31] the abomination was a muslim mosque of
[1:56:34] omar
[1:56:34] that was built on the temple ground
[1:56:35] where the holy place stood
[1:56:37] in 1896 titus came in and captured
[1:56:39] jerusalem and burnt the temple and they
[1:56:41] built the mosque of omar
[1:56:42] the muhammad religion right on the
[1:56:44] temple grounds and still stands there to
[1:56:46] this day
[1:56:47] and it will stand there until god
[1:56:48] returns to the jews
[1:56:50] and the abomination that is the mosque
[1:56:52] of our that makes desolation of the holy
[1:56:53] place standing in the holy place
[1:56:55] jesus referred to it and said in
[1:56:57] parentheses let him that readeth
[1:56:58] understand
[1:56:59] therefore he give us so many days from
[1:57:01] that time to after the prince and so
[1:57:02] many days and so forth
[1:57:04] and we'll get into that next sunday and
[1:57:06] trying to the best of my knowledge to
[1:57:08] get that in for you next sunday but the
[1:57:09] abomination is the mosque of amar
[1:57:11] that took the place of the temple the
[1:57:14] reason i say that is
[1:57:15] is because many people look at that
[1:57:17] brother
[1:57:18] in matthew 24 he says when you see the
[1:57:21] abomination that make desolation
[1:57:23] he says the mosque of amar and then
[1:57:26] in luke 21 he says when you see
[1:57:28] jerusalem compassed about with armies
[1:57:30] flee
[1:57:31] and he puts these two events together
[1:57:34] but those two events took place about
[1:57:36] 600 years apart
[1:57:38] because the mosque of amar really isn't
[1:57:39] the mosque of ammar it's really the dome
[1:57:41] of the rock
[1:57:42] that big golden dome that you see on the
[1:57:43] temple mount it's called the dome of the
[1:57:45] rock
[1:57:45] they didn't happen at the same time but
[1:57:47] brother bannon puts it to the same time
[1:57:49] the same thing because it is the same
[1:57:50] thing it's the holy temple being
[1:57:52] desecrated
[1:57:53] amen and something taking its place on
[1:57:55] top of the holy mountain so he can come
[1:57:57] in and in 70 a.d under titus it can be
[1:58:00] leveled
[1:58:00] in 600 and something a.d
[1:58:04] the dome of the rock can be built and
[1:58:05] brother branham links them right
[1:58:07] together and say it's showing the same
[1:58:08] thing
[1:58:09] it's showing destruction under the sixth
[1:58:10] seal it's showing judgment
[1:58:12] and now that dome of the rock proves
[1:58:14] that you're under gentile rule
[1:58:16] until that until jesus returns
[1:58:20] and presumably that thing goes i'm
[1:58:23] not going to go too far down that road
[1:58:27] so you see he links those stories
[1:58:28] together because they're interlinked
[1:58:30] together
[1:58:30] because if titus had never come and tore
[1:58:32] that thing down amen
[1:58:34] the muslims would have never marched in
[1:58:35] afterwards and built the dome of the
[1:58:36] rock
[1:58:38] one thing leads into another and leads
[1:58:39] into another and so now you see
[1:58:42] you see uh uh the the temple mounts been
[1:58:45] polluted by religion
[1:58:48] that's what the dome of the rock
[1:58:49] represents and the muslims is a religion
[1:58:51] like the jews because they both claim
[1:58:54] they come from abraham
[1:58:57] only abraham has two sons ishmael and
[1:58:59] isaac only the muslims and the
[1:59:01] took the opposite view of the jews the
[1:59:03] jews were descendants of isaac and they
[1:59:05] believed the promise went with isaac
[1:59:06] amen the muslims are descendants of
[1:59:08] ishmael and they believe the promise
[1:59:09] came with ishmael
[1:59:10] what do you got you've got twins again
[1:59:14] and you've got twin religions again
[1:59:17] and now the twin religion the false one
[1:59:21] is the one that's dominating the
[1:59:23] landscape with
[1:59:24] a mosque with a temple the dome of the
[1:59:26] rock up on the temple mount
[1:59:28] showing that the true religion has been
[1:59:31] abased
[1:59:32] amen and the false vine now is ruling
[1:59:35] over the old church see all this stuff
[1:59:39] means something friends and it means
[1:59:41] something to you and i
[1:59:42] amen because when when titus comes
[1:59:44] rolling in
[1:59:45] he comes rolling in in fact afterwards
[1:59:47] they tried to give titus awards and
[1:59:49] accolades for what he did
[1:59:50] and titus wouldn't accept it he said i
[1:59:52] was only a tool
[1:59:54] in the hand of divine judgment
[1:59:59] how did he know that i don't know but he
[2:00:01] said it
[2:00:02] why because he was a tool in the hand of
[2:00:05] god for divine judgment
[2:00:06] because when god came in the flesh they
[2:00:08] rejected him and when you spurn mercy
[2:00:11] there's nothing left but judgment
[2:00:13] and that's why this is a sixth seal it's
[2:00:16] right in between the fifth seal
[2:00:17] and 29 where he says the sixth seal and
[2:00:20] the tribulation of those days for the
[2:00:21] jews in world war ii but there was
[2:00:23] another
[2:00:23] six seal encounter that they had in a.d
[2:00:26] 70 when they rejected jesus christ and
[2:00:28] just a few years later
[2:00:30] not one stone was left upon another
[2:00:34] titus rolls in whose titus rome
[2:00:38] who does all of this rome
[2:00:42] it's interesting to know rome was even
[2:00:44] the originator of the muslim religion
[2:00:47] so it's still rome it's a still false
[2:00:50] religion
[2:00:51] it's the twin
[2:00:55] now jerusalem was the
[2:00:58] brother i said the most holy place the
[2:01:01] headquarters of true religion
[2:01:03] the old church he calls out all these
[2:01:05] things and in the old church in the
[2:01:07] headquarters of true religion
[2:01:09] amen jesus christ comes right to the
[2:01:12] church
[2:01:13] and the church refuses him and when they
[2:01:16] refuse him
[2:01:17] he did all the signs he did all the
[2:01:18] scriptures he did everything he was
[2:01:20] supposed to do
[2:01:21] he never failed once the failure was was
[2:01:24] on their end
[2:01:27] and when it came time if and for malachi
[2:01:29] 4 and luke 17 30 to reveal the coming of
[2:01:32] the son of man he didn't fail on one
[2:01:34] scripture
[2:01:35] the failure was not him the son of man
[2:01:37] the failure was the churches
[2:01:40] because he did everything that the
[2:01:41] scripture said that he would do
[2:01:44] but now titus comes rolling in and he's
[2:01:47] going to
[2:01:48] surround the old church and i've got an
[2:01:50] article here of the siege of jerusalem
[2:01:51] i'm going to read one small
[2:01:54] section now that says in april 70
[2:01:58] ce about the time of passover
[2:02:01] huh about the time of passover
[2:02:06] isn't god just in everything he does
[2:02:09] when was jesus christ rejected
[2:02:11] and slain passover
[2:02:15] they rejected the messiah the true
[2:02:18] passover lamb
[2:02:19] and now their destruction is going to
[2:02:21] start at the time
[2:02:22] of passover about the time of passover
[2:02:26] the roman general titus besieged
[2:02:28] jerusalem
[2:02:29] since that action coincided with
[2:02:30] passover the romans allowed pilgrims to
[2:02:32] enter the city
[2:02:33] but refused to let them leave
[2:02:37] what were they doing they were using
[2:02:39] religion
[2:02:41] religion to create a trap
[2:02:44] i want to ask you what is rome doing
[2:02:46] today
[2:02:48] rome is using religion to create a trap
[2:02:52] and they know under the religious feast
[2:02:54] of passover you have pilgrims that come
[2:02:56] from all over and return back to
[2:02:58] jerusalem
[2:02:59] because they're told to in the law of
[2:03:00] moses
[2:03:02] so now the population they said went up
[2:03:04] josephus estimates there was 1.1 million
[2:03:07] people in the city
[2:03:09] when titus besieged it but it was way
[2:03:11] more than the normal population
[2:03:13] because titus knew that if we get all
[2:03:16] these people in
[2:03:17] amen they'll deplete all their food
[2:03:19] stores and they'll starve to death
[2:03:20] faster
[2:03:21] these pilgrims weren't soldiers they
[2:03:23] were women and children and men with
[2:03:25] families and the elderly and so
[2:03:26] he creates a religious trap and in the
[2:03:30] religious trap
[2:03:31] he lets them all come into worship
[2:03:33] because you can come and worship
[2:03:39] praise be to god it's the same thing
[2:03:41] rome's always done
[2:03:42] is the same thing rome's attempting to
[2:03:44] do now through the world council of
[2:03:45] churches and all their ecumenical move
[2:03:47] let's just come together and have
[2:03:49] worship you can come together and
[2:03:50] worship
[2:03:51] and what are they doing they're trying
[2:03:52] to get everybody behind the walls of the
[2:03:55] old church
[2:03:57] trying to get the old religious system
[2:03:59] amen and trying to get everybody to move
[2:04:02] in behind the walls of the old religious
[2:04:04] system
[2:04:04] and it looked good it looked nice i mean
[2:04:07] they're here they're going to set rule
[2:04:09] and order but they're letting us come
[2:04:10] and worship anyways they're only
[2:04:12] trapping you in a religious system
[2:04:15] and when he got when he got everybody in
[2:04:18] there and jerusalem was about to pop
[2:04:20] they couldn't get anybody else in the
[2:04:21] gate
[2:04:21] he tightens his noose and now he
[2:04:23] besieges the city
[2:04:24] and he builds another wall around that
[2:04:27] wall
[2:04:29] and now the safety of the old church
[2:04:33] becomes the death trap
[2:04:37] this is why the old traditional
[2:04:38] understanding is a death trap
[2:04:41] the old church is a death trap i don't
[2:04:43] care what they say
[2:04:44] i don't care what anybody else says amen
[2:04:47] this church has got to be a church
[2:04:49] that's moving forward in the resolution
[2:04:50] of jesus christ because
[2:04:52] the dog to go back will always equal
[2:04:54] death
[2:04:56] always so now so now he brings him into
[2:05:00] this death trap
[2:05:01] amen and then he builds a wall around
[2:05:03] them and cuts off their supplies
[2:05:05] and now he starves them to death oh rome
[2:05:08] hasn't changed their tactics at all
[2:05:10] let's get everybody agree we'll come and
[2:05:12] worship protestants and catholics
[2:05:14] it doesn't matter if you're lutheran
[2:05:15] doesn't matter if you're protestant it
[2:05:16] doesn't matter
[2:05:17] come into the old system we'll tighten
[2:05:19] it down and we'll
[2:05:20] cut off your spiritual food
[2:05:25] no revelation no word no ministry of a
[2:05:28] prophet
[2:05:29] all you've got and now they start eating
[2:05:31] grass
[2:05:33] because they got no spiritual food now
[2:05:35] you wonder why rock and roll comes into
[2:05:36] a church amen they start eating bark and
[2:05:38] grass
[2:05:39] because there's no more spiritual food
[2:05:41] to eat you got to give the people
[2:05:42] something to eat and that's how a
[2:05:43] program comes in
[2:05:44] and a youth this and this that and a
[2:05:47] single's this
[2:05:50] they start eating the bark off the tree
[2:05:52] they start taking the dirt they start
[2:05:54] feasting on their own
[2:05:56] children
[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:06:00] nothing's changed nothing has changed
[2:06:06] get them in the system tighten the noose
[2:06:09] down
[2:06:11] cut off all spiritual food and weaken
[2:06:14] them
[2:06:15] and weaken them until they're willing to
[2:06:18] eat
[2:06:19] anything
[2:06:22] just to survive that spirit
[2:06:26] is still alive because spirits don't
[2:06:30] die what has been will be again
[2:06:34] and under a week in condension they
[2:06:36] start to beat down the walls
[2:06:38] they beat down the walls and they make
[2:06:40] their way into the temple mount
[2:06:43] when they make their way into the temple
[2:06:44] mount they burn down the temple
[2:06:47] destroy it and the blood
[2:06:51] flows out of the temple gate and down
[2:06:53] the temple stairs
[2:06:56] because they rejected the blood of jesus
[2:06:58] christ
[2:06:59] now their own blood is spilt on their
[2:07:02] own temple
[2:07:05] it's not a kind thing to reject the word
[2:07:09] it's a serious thing they openly
[2:07:13] and defiantly and on purpose rejected
[2:07:15] jesus christ
[2:07:17] nicodemus comes and says we know that
[2:07:18] you're a man set from god
[2:07:20] for no man can do the works you do
[2:07:22] unless you be of god
[2:07:25] people will tell you i love the way you
[2:07:27] live i love the i love the way you raise
[2:07:28] your family i love how respectful your
[2:07:30] kids are i love
[2:07:31] how sincere you are people know it's the
[2:07:35] truth
[2:07:36] they just don't want to make a sacrifice
[2:07:40] to believe they know it's the truth why
[2:07:43] do they show you respect why do they
[2:07:45] show you kindness
[2:07:46] why do they make good comments about you
[2:07:48] and your household and your family and
[2:07:49] your church
[2:07:52] why because they know it's the truth
[2:07:55] and they knew jesus christ was a man
[2:07:58] sent from god
[2:07:59] and they wouldn't reject the old system
[2:08:02] to take him but if you're going to have
[2:08:06] christ
[2:08:06] whatever day you're living in you've got
[2:08:08] to reject the old system to have him
[2:08:11] even today
[2:08:15] see after
[2:08:19] he destroyed the temple they burn it out
[2:08:23] why the mercy seat was destroyed because
[2:08:27] there was no
[2:08:28] shekinah glory of god there anymore
[2:08:35] then at the east side of the temple
[2:08:38] he offered an ox and a sheep and swine's
[2:08:41] blood
[2:08:43] on the east side because the temple was
[2:08:45] destroyed and he offered it to the roman
[2:08:47] gods
[2:08:48] what'd he do he made abomination that
[2:08:50] maketh desolation
[2:08:53] what was that the sixth seal breaking
[2:08:56] out on the jews
[2:08:57] what happened after that conquest after
[2:09:00] conquest after conquest
[2:09:01] finally somebody comes in and builds a
[2:09:03] dome with a rock which is just a
[2:09:05] symbol of what's going on over there
[2:09:09] it's the abomination that make a
[2:09:10] desolation that started all the way back
[2:09:12] in titus that actually goes back to the
[2:09:14] greeks to
[2:09:15] uh antiochus epiphanes it's the same
[2:09:18] cycle repeating through history
[2:09:21] but let's not let it repeat to us
[2:09:25] let's not get brought into some system
[2:09:27] of some man
[2:09:29] there's all kinds of systems we have all
[2:09:31] of our own systems
[2:09:33] we love to come up with well i'm going
[2:09:36] to stay right here because this is safe
[2:09:38] remember what i said about the light
[2:09:40] shining brother talked about the light
[2:09:42] the man was down there in kentucky he
[2:09:44] shined that light and he told brother
[2:09:46] branham i don't believe in revelation or
[2:09:48] something like that
[2:09:50] and i only believe in what i see
[2:09:53] and brother branham asked him about his
[2:09:55] home or something like that when you go
[2:09:56] up to the home he says i don't see your
[2:09:57] home.
[2:09:58] he says it's right over there how do you
[2:09:59] know it's there oh i know it's there
[2:10:00] well how do you get there you can't see
[2:10:01] that from here see there's a path there
[2:10:03] well how do you see the path i don't see
[2:10:04] the path said i got a light
[2:10:06] he said that light's only good for one
[2:10:07] step at a time
[2:10:09] amen so you hold that line up and
[2:10:11] brother bam said that's when he said
[2:10:13] well take this light and walk in this
[2:10:14] lie
[2:10:14] and stick with it and stay with it and
[2:10:16] watch it unfold itself
[2:10:19] the problem is this is what human beings
[2:10:21] do this is what you and i do
[2:10:23] don't point the finger to anybody else
[2:10:25] this is what we do we'll hold the light
[2:10:27] up and we're amazed at what we see
[2:10:30] look at this there's a treated bush
[2:10:32] there in the house there and there's a
[2:10:33] well and
[2:10:34] and we start describing everything in
[2:10:36] the peripheral and within the limits of
[2:10:38] the light
[2:10:39] and then we get comfortable with where
[2:10:41] everything's at the well's here
[2:10:43] the house is there the chicken coop's
[2:10:45] over there the path is here
[2:10:47] and we just keep rehearsing what's in
[2:10:48] the light and talking about what's in
[2:10:50] the light
[2:10:51] and reinforcing what's in the light and
[2:10:54] making flannel graphs on what's in the
[2:10:55] light
[2:10:56] and teaching the kids what's in the
[2:10:57] light
[2:10:59] they understand what i'm saying but
[2:11:02] right at the edge of the light there's
[2:11:03] something intriguing
[2:11:05] and it's right in there in that spot you
[2:11:07] can make it out you can see it you can
[2:11:09] see there's something
[2:11:10] there but it's not like super crystal
[2:11:12] clear what it is but there's something
[2:11:13] there
[2:11:15] and you spend some time looking over
[2:11:17] there you're like there's something
[2:11:18] there
[2:11:19] and i think i think that might be a
[2:11:22] further step in getting home
[2:11:25] are you sure i'm not sure but i'm pretty
[2:11:27] sure i've been watching it for a while
[2:11:29] and every once in a while in the later
[2:11:30] moons i get a little more light
[2:11:33] that's this message friends i get a
[2:11:36] little more light
[2:11:37] and but how do you know you're right
[2:11:40] well i don't know i'm right well how do
[2:11:41] you know you're right i've got to go
[2:11:42] stand on that spot
[2:11:44] oh but what if you're wrong why don't
[2:11:46] you just stay here
[2:11:48] amen in the new system of the lantern
[2:11:50] line we've got everything
[2:11:52] mapped out we know where it belongs
[2:11:53] we've talked about it for decades
[2:11:55] our children know about it we know this
[2:11:57] is this and this and that and we've
[2:11:58] already pigeonholed all the scriptures
[2:12:02] you don't have to think you can buy the
[2:12:04] book we've got to color in fill in the
[2:12:06] blank for you
[2:12:11] you know what i'm saying is the truth
[2:12:13] because we're all guilty of the same
[2:12:15] thing
[2:12:15] we want safety and security and the very
[2:12:18] thing we do to create safety and
[2:12:19] security
[2:12:20] is the very thing that destroys us
[2:12:22] because everybody started a denomination
[2:12:24] to protect their truth and in protecting
[2:12:27] their truth they lost the truth
[2:12:31] every time and in the message if we try
[2:12:33] to protect the truth i'm only going this
[2:12:35] far
[2:12:36] i won't be going beyond these bounds
[2:12:37] this is all a safe area
[2:12:39] we know all of this we've known all of
[2:12:40] this we can prove all of this in the
[2:12:42] bible we know
[2:12:42] serpency we can teach our kids our kids
[2:12:45] can teach theologian serpency
[2:12:48] water baptism in jesus name all of these
[2:12:51] things
[2:12:52] the church ages we've mastered it
[2:12:55] but remember this light is supposed to
[2:12:57] get us home
[2:12:58] we got to go home this light takes us
[2:13:01] home friends and i haven't gotten
[2:13:03] home yet because a hybrid condition in
[2:13:05] my flesh my atoms have not changed
[2:13:08] that means there's more progress to make
[2:13:10] [Music]
[2:13:12] not a new message but no fear and
[2:13:15] venturing
[2:13:16] in the message that's been given to us
[2:13:20] and we'll stand within the walls
[2:13:24] because we've done a lot of battle over
[2:13:25] these truths
[2:13:26] [Music]
[2:13:28] we fought for serpent seed fought for
[2:13:31] water baptism in jesus name
[2:13:33] so we started building walls
[2:13:36] we've got this scripture in this
[2:13:38] scripture and history i got an
[2:13:39] eight-foot wall right over here by water
[2:13:41] baptism in jesus name
[2:13:45] i got a good one over here on servant
[2:13:46] seed and oneness of the godhead
[2:13:50] and before too long we've walled
[2:13:52] ourselves in
[2:13:56] trying to be safe
[2:13:59] but show me one prophet that stayed safe
[2:14:01] with the word
[2:14:03] show me where jesus christ the safest
[2:14:05] place to be is
[2:14:06] moving when the light moves
[2:14:11] you know what happens when the light
[2:14:12] moves on when we build a wall
[2:14:15] we got ourselves on the wall city we
[2:14:17] plug in the electricity
[2:14:19] click and now you've got man-made light
[2:14:25] the definition of denominationalism
[2:14:29] and where everyone guilty of it but you
[2:14:32] know what i'm going to have to do if i'm
[2:14:33] going to make it home
[2:14:34] i got to have enough courage to look at
[2:14:37] this thing
[2:14:38] and say ah there's something pulling me
[2:14:41] to that
[2:14:42] there's something there i can see it's
[2:14:45] not like walking in the blind there's
[2:14:46] something you actually there
[2:14:47] there i see the quote i see it in the
[2:14:49] scripture there's something there but i
[2:14:50] don't fully understand it
[2:14:52] the key to do is take your light and
[2:14:54] walk over there
[2:14:55] and stand on that spot and see if the
[2:14:57] message won't illuminate that
[2:15:00] amen and when it illuminates it you say
[2:15:04] wow
[2:15:05] i had no idea all of this was over here
[2:15:07] too
[2:15:08] all i knew was water baptism serpent
[2:15:11] seed
[2:15:12] godhead the seven church ages i had no
[2:15:15] idea he told us about what was going on
[2:15:17] in heaven
[2:15:17] before the foundation of the world i had
[2:15:19] no idea that he was telling me
[2:15:21] amen all about the other dimensions
[2:15:24] because he was afraid to move then you
[2:15:26] bump out and it moves
[2:15:29] and praise god sometimes when you get
[2:15:32] over there and you bump out and you move
[2:15:34] you realize no that's not the path
[2:15:38] but what's wrong with finding out what's
[2:15:40] over there now you know this
[2:15:42] ain't the path praise god let's go find
[2:15:45] where the path is
[2:15:47] let's not build a walled city amen and
[2:15:50] wall ourselves behind
[2:15:51] generational truths but let's let the
[2:15:55] generational truth be a foundation that
[2:15:57] we keep building on
[2:15:58] as we go higher and higher in christ
[2:16:02] we're not going to reject any of those
[2:16:03] things those are the very things we're
[2:16:04] standing on so that we can see over the
[2:16:06] wall
[2:16:07] amen it's the very thing that lifts us
[2:16:09] higher and higher
[2:16:10] and higher and so let's not wall
[2:16:12] ourselves in but let's build ourselves
[2:16:14] amen a little higher in christ edify the
[2:16:18] body of christ
[2:16:19] get clearer vision let the lantern go
[2:16:21] just a little bit further
[2:16:24] move out and explore just a little bit
[2:16:26] everybody be hungry be careful be
[2:16:28] careful
[2:16:29] i saw somebody walk over there before
[2:16:30] and they fell off a cliff
[2:16:34] they believed in tucson and they
[2:16:35] believed in thunders and they believed
[2:16:37] in
[2:16:40] i saw somebody go over there and they
[2:16:41] never came back
[2:16:45] that's no excuse for not exploring the
[2:16:47] message
[2:16:48] that's no excuse for not digging a
[2:16:50] little deeper and then going a little
[2:16:51] farther
[2:16:52] and finding out if it was wrong then
[2:16:53] what's the truth of it
[2:16:56] because you can't teach anything in
[2:16:58] error unless it's founded on something
[2:17:00] true so instead of run away from the
[2:17:03] whole thing
[2:17:04] let's find out what was the true part is
[2:17:07] there truth there i want the truth i
[2:17:09] want all the truth
[2:17:10] i want the truth that's been tainted
[2:17:13] if there's truth there i'll dig the
[2:17:15] truth out and leave the rest thank you
[2:17:17] i'll go over here if there's truth over
[2:17:19] here embrace god by the grace of god i
[2:17:21] want to dig the truth out here and leave
[2:17:22] the rest over there i don't want nothing
[2:17:24] that comes from a man
[2:17:25] but i want the truth that's been given
[2:17:26] to us by this message and i want every
[2:17:28] drop
[2:17:29] of it and i'm not going to praise god
[2:17:31] run into some walled city and worsen
[2:17:33] that
[2:17:34] build a city myself because that's what
[2:17:36] rome wants
[2:17:37] rome wants you to build your own church
[2:17:41] who built jerusalem the jews who built
[2:17:43] the walls the jews who trapped them in
[2:17:45] it the romans
[2:17:47] who built the denominations the
[2:17:49] protestants
[2:17:51] who built the lutherans who built the
[2:17:53] the wesley wall
[2:17:54] who built the pentecostal wall the
[2:17:56] protestants who's going to trap them in
[2:17:58] the wall
[2:17:59] the romans
[2:18:02] and i don't want to get trapped in some
[2:18:04] message wall because the message isn't a
[2:18:06] walled city
[2:18:07] the message is a path home it's the new
[2:18:10] jerusalem
[2:18:11] it's the heavenly city that's come down
[2:18:13] from god and i want to explore all of
[2:18:15] its gardens all of its rivers and i want
[2:18:16] to get all the way to the top
[2:18:21] well starve me out you see people are
[2:18:25] starving
[2:18:26] for some fresh manna from heaven
[2:18:29] starving and because there's no fresh
[2:18:32] man coming from heaven because we stay
[2:18:34] in the safe calm veins of our lamplight
[2:18:37] they're starving now and the children
[2:18:39] are running to entertainment
[2:18:42] children are running to sports and
[2:18:44] running to this and running to that
[2:18:45] why because they can only eat grass for
[2:18:48] so long
[2:18:52] let's feed on the fresh man and come
[2:18:54] keep in the journey stay with the light
[2:18:57] don't be afraid even if there's
[2:18:58] something there go stand on it
[2:19:02] and if you find out you were wrong say i
[2:19:04] was wrong
[2:19:08] i don't know what the problem is no but
[2:19:10] i learned a whole lot
[2:19:12] by taking a venture over here and
[2:19:14] digging around the message and find out
[2:19:16] if this is true or not and i found out
[2:19:17] it's wrong this isn't the path to walk
[2:19:19] but i tell you what i learned a whole
[2:19:21] lot on that little trip
[2:19:26] titus come in built a wall around their
[2:19:29] wall
[2:19:32] and trapped him but all those who had
[2:19:34] heard the message
[2:19:36] from the great shepherd not one of them
[2:19:40] were trapped behind that wall
[2:19:43] i want to ask you friends have you heard
[2:19:44] the message
[2:19:47] when you see this ecumenical council
[2:19:49] begin to tighten up when you see this
[2:19:50] world council of churches
[2:19:52] when you see the stagnation and fear to
[2:19:54] move
[2:19:56] flee from the city run away
[2:19:59] titus is on his way when you see him
[2:20:02] encompassed about with armies
[2:20:04] run that's when it's time to run
[2:20:08] stay free stay on the move not one was
[2:20:10] trapped behind the walls
[2:20:13] and i say let's stay free
[2:20:16] keep the lantern in your hand and keep
[2:20:19] walking
[2:20:22] and stick with it and don't move no
[2:20:24] matter what anybody else says
[2:20:26] and then you'll see it'll reveal itself
[2:20:29] brother brahm said
[2:20:30] walk into the light and walk out and
[2:20:32] some more will bump out
[2:20:34] use that term bump out how do you get
[2:20:36] the light to bump out
[2:20:37] not by sitting right in the middle of
[2:20:39] your walled city afraid to move
[2:20:43] but you've got to be pressing the
[2:20:44] darkness and getting out there and
[2:20:46] exploring the edge of the light
[2:20:47] and when you do more will bump out if
[2:20:49] more doesn't bump out go try someplace
[2:20:52] else because you can't bump it out
[2:20:55] but if we have the right attitude and
[2:20:57] the right approach as children amen
[2:20:59] exploring
[2:21:00] you know i don't think god put adam and
[2:21:02] eve in the garden of eden
[2:21:03] to sit down right in the center of
[2:21:05] garden eating afraid to move out because
[2:21:07] they're not so sure what's out there
[2:21:10] the garden of eden was an expression of
[2:21:12] his thought and he wanted his children
[2:21:14] to understand the expression of his
[2:21:16] thought
[2:21:17] and i think he liked it when they
[2:21:18] explored i think they
[2:21:20] liked it when they asked questions amen
[2:21:23] i'm sure
[2:21:23] adam liked it amen because brother said
[2:21:25] adam the first day that the woman came
[2:21:27] forth
[2:21:28] adam took his wife and he went walking
[2:21:30] through the garden and says let me show
[2:21:31] you this and let me show you this and
[2:21:33] let me show you that
[2:21:34] what was it adam was a god on the earth
[2:21:37] and in his territory was the garden of
[2:21:39] eden
[2:21:39] and when his wife come along his side he
[2:21:42] couldn't wait to show her what was all
[2:21:44] in the garden
[2:21:44] and i named it this because of this
[2:21:46] reason and i did this because of that
[2:21:48] and i moved this over here for this
[2:21:49] reason
[2:21:52] i think adam would have been awfully
[2:21:53] disappointed and she'd be like ah
[2:21:55] i'm just not interested
[2:21:58] can we go back to where the kumquats
[2:22:00] were i'm just going to stay right there
[2:22:04] i think it probably this is just brother
[2:22:06] chat i'm probably wrong to say poor
[2:22:08] brother he don't know nothing
[2:22:10] but i imagine if if eve would ever ask
[2:22:13] adam a question
[2:22:14] adam why did you move this tree from
[2:22:16] here over there
[2:22:18] i don't understand i'm sure adam got
[2:22:21] pretty tickled
[2:22:22] because everything he did was for a
[2:22:24] purpose
[2:22:25] and he probably says oh i've just been
[2:22:28] waiting for you to ask that question
[2:22:30] there's a huge revelation behind that
[2:22:33] why did you name that animal that oh
[2:22:36] praise god because it matches his
[2:22:38] characteristics
[2:22:41] god why did you put the word here like
[2:22:44] this
[2:22:45] why did brother branham put these two
[2:22:46] scriptures together
[2:22:48] why did he use those two opening
[2:22:50] scriptures and choosing of a bride
[2:22:53] why does the bible say that one of the
[2:22:55] seven violent angels shows the
[2:22:57] destruction of the
[2:22:58] and brother branham showed us how the
[2:22:59] will be destroyed why did you do
[2:23:01] that
[2:23:02] what does that mean i don't think god's
[2:23:05] upset
[2:23:05] i think what bothers god is when you're
[2:23:07] not interested
[2:23:09] and we don't care to explore his
[2:23:11] wonderful garden that he's put us in
[2:23:13] called the message of the hour
[2:23:14] and he put us here he gave it to us
[2:23:17] let's enjoy
[2:23:18] it amen let's run all through it amen
[2:23:20] let's run
[2:23:21] and try this and try that and sample
[2:23:23] this and ask this question and discover
[2:23:25] this
[2:23:26] let's not get behind a walled city and
[2:23:29] let the roman
[2:23:30] spirit come in now you say no well we're
[2:23:32] not dealing with the vatican
[2:23:34] and i know better than getting council
[2:23:35] churches i'm not signing no papers
[2:23:41] if that's what you think this is going
[2:23:42] to be like you're already deceived
[2:23:46] it's a spirit that creeps in subtly that
[2:23:48] you don't notice it
[2:23:50] it's not i'm not signing no papers and
[2:23:52] if the government causes me to register
[2:23:53] and i've got to register under some new
[2:23:55] movement
[2:23:55] i'm i'm i'm wary to that i'm not going
[2:23:58] to sign my name on a paper we're not
[2:23:59] signing our church up for that
[2:24:02] my goodness you're already too far gone
[2:24:04] when you get to that place
[2:24:05] that's not what you watch for you watch
[2:24:07] for that subtle spirit coming in
[2:24:09] trying to make you afraid of the very
[2:24:12] word that he's given you
[2:24:14] trying to cause fear to explore the
[2:24:16] guard in your place to
[2:24:17] trying to create safety nets to protect
[2:24:20] what we have
[2:24:21] i'm just going to stick with this and
[2:24:22] i'm only going to stick with that
[2:24:25] amen don't worry about signing on the
[2:24:28] dotted line
[2:24:29] don't worry about that worry about that
[2:24:31] subtility of the serpent that's coming
[2:24:33] in
[2:24:34] and saying yeah brother venom said but
[2:24:36] he also said
[2:24:42] that's the slick tongue slicker you got
[2:24:44] to watch out for and that one's talking
[2:24:46] in your own head
[2:24:48] i mean it's the roman spirit trying to
[2:24:51] trap the people
[2:24:52] trying to get us amen get us trapped to
[2:24:55] reject the word to trap us down
[2:24:57] to fall under the sixth seal
[2:25:01] but praise be to god i've already went
[2:25:03] through the sixth seal
[2:25:05] on calvary i was there
[2:25:09] and i'm here and i'm there
[2:25:13] and time means nothing to god when was
[2:25:17] jesus christ crucified
[2:25:20] amen you say 2 000 years ago you missed
[2:25:23] something
[2:25:24] because from for us it was 2 000 years
[2:25:27] ago
[2:25:27] for god he's always been the lamb
[2:25:29] crucified
[2:25:31] when was i saved don't say 30 years ago
[2:25:34] don't say 20 years ago
[2:25:35] you've always been saved in the mind of
[2:25:37] god you always have been always where
[2:25:39] were always will be it's eternal and
[2:25:42] he's the eternal lamb slain
[2:25:44] and you're eternally seated with him in
[2:25:46] heavenly places you were eternally with
[2:25:47] him then
[2:25:48] you will eternally be eternally with him
[2:25:50] forever you're with him now
[2:25:53] how does it work what's the physics i
[2:25:54] don't know the physics
[2:25:57] i just know the truth out of the bible
[2:25:59] and i believe it
[2:26:01] let's not get hemmed in by our own
[2:26:03] thinking
[2:26:05] let's not reject the word and push
[2:26:07] ourselves into judgment
[2:26:10] but let's stay free and outside of
[2:26:12] walled cities
[2:26:13] because i guarantee rome's coming
[2:26:17] rome is coming rome is here
[2:26:20] rome is on the march and stay away from
[2:26:23] it
[2:26:25] and if you think you got to go kiss the
[2:26:26] pope's ring to somehow bow before rome
[2:26:29] you're wrong you can bow before it every
[2:26:32] day by taking that
[2:26:34] same spirit of denomination to protect
[2:26:37] the truth that's given us and the fear
[2:26:39] to move forward for fear of being wrong
[2:26:42] and i would crucify that thing and tell
[2:26:45] that serpent to get behind me satan
[2:26:48] but i'm going to enjoy this garden that
[2:26:51] god's given me
[2:26:53] full of perfectly good food
[2:26:57] brother banham was told to cancel his
[2:26:59] overseas trip and do what
[2:27:01] store up the food and there's a
[2:27:04] storehouse
[2:27:05] full of food and i'm going to eat it all
[2:27:10] when i go down and i get a tape like
[2:27:14] feast of trumpets and you crack that
[2:27:17] seal and you spin that jar open you look
[2:27:19] at you like
[2:27:20] what is that
[2:27:26] what is that i don't know but if it's in
[2:27:29] the storehouse it's good
[2:27:30] just start eating it because it'll
[2:27:33] digest
[2:27:35] it'll give you nourishment it'll give
[2:27:36] you life amen and god will
[2:27:39] will reveal it to you when it's time
[2:27:41] don't be afraid of the food
[2:27:43] don't be afraid of the food in
[2:27:44] storehouse don't be afraid of the
[2:27:45] message don't be afraid of brother
[2:27:47] branham's quotes don't be afraid of
[2:27:48] contradictory quotes
[2:27:50] don't be afraid to let the scriptures
[2:27:52] flex
[2:27:55] say brother chad it's the scriptures i
[2:27:57] know it's the scriptures but
[2:27:58] jesus flexed the scriptures
[2:28:02] i don't believe you jesus took
[2:28:04] scriptures out of context and out of
[2:28:06] place
[2:28:07] changed the wording and used it in
[2:28:08] another way
[2:28:13] why because he was the word and he knew
[2:28:15] what it meant
[2:28:16] and he knew that that prophecy is a dual
[2:28:18] fulfillment sometimes two sometimes more
[2:28:20] sometimes spiritual sometimes natural
[2:28:22] sometimes natural and spiritual at the
[2:28:24] same time
[2:28:24] sometimes natural and spiritual then
[2:28:26] spiritual than natural
[2:28:27] you get my point in a revolving history
[2:28:30] as it unfolds
[2:28:31] because he knew the word was eternal and
[2:28:33] the word would always match the
[2:28:34] situation
[2:28:36] but he had no problem with taking
[2:28:37] something that david was speaking about
[2:28:39] about a current event pop it out of what
[2:28:41] david had said change the wording
[2:28:43] and reapply it to his day
[2:28:46] and he was right and guess what the
[2:28:48] apostle paul did the same thing
[2:28:51] and guess what peter did the same thing
[2:28:54] they would leave parts out they would
[2:28:55] add parts they would take two scriptures
[2:28:57] and put them together
[2:28:59] oh praise god now we're getting to some
[2:29:01] good stuff because brother branham did
[2:29:03] the same thing
[2:29:04] why because he knew the word and he knew
[2:29:06] what he was talking about
[2:29:10] let's not be afraid of the word friends
[2:29:13] let's keep moving forward
[2:29:15] let's all stand i got off on a
[2:29:18] tangent but praise be to the lord
[2:29:23] somebody was pulling in a certain
[2:29:24] direction
[2:29:26] i think maybe we'll come back and finish
[2:29:28] this up
[2:29:30] wednesday
[2:29:35] but i just want to say i love you guys
[2:29:38] god bless you
[2:29:39] let's keep marching forward let's not be
[2:29:42] afraid of this word
[2:29:43] it won't hurt us this message won't hurt
[2:29:45] us don't be afraid to explore
[2:29:49] don't be afraid to ask your husband
[2:29:53] what is this why is that there
[2:29:56] why is it like that i think he likes it
[2:30:00] i think he likes it let's just bow our
[2:30:03] heads and pray
[2:30:05] dear lord jesus we thank you father for
[2:30:08] this day you've given us
[2:30:11] lord i'm a long ways from where i
[2:30:12] intended to be but i believe i'm exactly
[2:30:14] where you want us to be
[2:30:16] god you have control over all things you
[2:30:19] control your gifts and you control
[2:30:21] your people lord and we want you to have
[2:30:23] absolute control over us
[2:30:25] lead us and guide us by your spirit lord
[2:30:29] god i pray that you'd break away from us
[2:30:31] any iron curtain
[2:30:33] any denominational idea any wall that
[2:30:35] we've built
[2:30:36] lord give us the grace to tear that
[2:30:38] thing down
[2:30:40] help us god to have courage to move
[2:30:42] forward in your word
[2:30:44] lord let that light shine just a little
[2:30:46] farther lord
[2:30:47] that we might see something that'll take
[2:30:50] us to the next step in our journey
[2:30:52] god i pray that you give us the courage
[2:30:54] to walk there and stand in it and let
[2:30:56] the light illuminate that for us
[2:30:59] god let us keep moving forward where you
[2:31:01] want us to be in the path that you've
[2:31:03] chosen for us
[2:31:04] let us never grow stagnant lord or weary
[2:31:07] of the journey
[2:31:09] but let us enjoy lord what you've given
[2:31:11] to us to enjoy
[2:31:12] god bless your people help us to grow in
[2:31:14] revelation
[2:31:16] keep lord keep on opening our eyes to
[2:31:19] your truth keep rubbing that eye salve
[2:31:21] in our eyes lord
[2:31:22] that we can see clearly where we're
[2:31:24] standing and what's going on all around
[2:31:26] us
[2:31:27] we love you lord we ask your blessing as
[2:31:29] we part
[2:31:30] keep us lord by your grace and use us to
[2:31:33] be light into this world and may
[2:31:34] somebody
[2:31:36] see the beacon light and come to you
[2:31:38] lord
[2:31:39] that's our greatest desire is to see a
[2:31:41] soul saved
[2:31:42] to see somebody come to the light in the
[2:31:44] mystery of their life to come unraveled
[2:31:46] under those seals
[2:31:48] we pray that lord is there still one
[2:31:49] there that you'd bring them in
[2:31:51] we love your father and ask that you'd
[2:31:53] have your way with us
[2:31:55] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[2:31:59] god bless you brother come away
