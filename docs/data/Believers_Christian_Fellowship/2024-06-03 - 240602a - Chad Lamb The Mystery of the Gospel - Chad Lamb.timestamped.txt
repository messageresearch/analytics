[20:32] made it safely to the Democratic
[20:34] Republic of Congo he's beginning his
[20:36] work he had a Sunday morning service so
[20:38] they ahead of us so I think he's already
[20:40] preached today he's got a service
[20:42] Tuesday and then Wednesday then he's
[20:43] flying over to the Northeast Province to
[20:46] do some work over there for a few days
[20:47] so just remember him in prayer and
[20:49] remember his family that is here and we
[20:52] don't want to forget him also want to
[20:55] thank you all for your prayers for our
[20:56] family these last few days the the

[21:05] the funeral may God bless you for that
[21:07] it really meant a lot to us and it meant
[21:08] a lot to my mom and uh she's been
[21:11] appreciating all the text and all the
[21:13] cards and all the sympathy that you've
[21:15] expressed and it's been a real blessing
[21:17] and a real encouragement to her so God
[21:19] bless you all and thank you for that
[21:21] amen if you ever want to know how
[21:23] important a body is just wait till a
[21:25] trial a difficulty H your family and you
[21:28] realize how much you love God's family
[21:31] amen how much they mean to you also want
[21:34] to let you know that uh this coming
[21:36] Sunday a week from today I'll be going
[21:38] down to preach in Junction City to the
[21:40] ex Alish group of Believers down there
[21:43] they called and ask me uh some time ago
[21:45] and we've been working on it so that
[21:47] date works out well so I'll be going
[21:49] there but also I got a call from Brother
[21:52] son Simon Abbott from UK he called me a
[21:55] few weeks ago and told me that he's
[21:56] coming so him and his wife and his
[21:59] wife's mother sister ponnie will be here
[22:02] uh actually late Wednesday night they
[22:04] arrive in Cleveland and drive down so
[22:06] they'll be here I think for about two
[22:07] weeks and so when I found out he was
[22:10] going to be here the same time I was
[22:11] going to be gone I called and asked him
[22:13] if he would take the service and he said
[22:14] he would so I said well thank God he
[22:16] provided amen so it was just good timing
[22:19] so also pray for their traveling they'll
[22:21] be they'll be leaving uh I think
[22:23] Wednesday early morning so pray for them
[22:26] and then pray if you don't mind pray for
[22:27] us remember us for that service next
[22:29] Sunday I'll remind you again on
[22:31] Wednesday and then also for the service
[22:33] here amen thank god let's all
[22:40] stand if we could let's turn to
[22:42] Ephesians chapter
[22:55] 6 Ephesians
[23:01] chapter
[23:04] 6 and verse
[23:07] 18 verse 18 Paul's just instructing the
[23:10] Saints to pray he says praying always
[23:12] with all prayer and supplication in the
[23:15] spirit and watching there unto with all
[23:17] perseverance and supplication for All
[23:19] Saints and for me so he's saying pray
[23:23] for me also that utterance may be given
[23:26] unto me that I may open my mouth boldly
[23:29] to make known The Mystery of the gospel
[23:32] for which I am an ambassador in bonds
[23:34] that therein I may speak boldly as I
[23:37] ought to speak amen God bless you as
[23:40] you're seated may God bless us as we
[23:42] look at his
[23:43] word amen I don't know brother Brenham
[23:47] made the statement I don't I I'm not
[23:49] going to quote it exactly right but he
[23:50] made the statement something like
[23:51] preaching is never something you get
[23:53] used to and I I'm exactly the same way
[23:56] I'm standing here and and in uh in
[23:59] turmoil because everything gets all
[24:01] mixed up and jumbled up and you have one
[24:04] thing in your mind and you're pretty
[24:05] sure you're going to do something and
[24:07] then late in the evening the night
[24:09] before God changes everything and so
[24:11] we're going in a different direction
[24:12] than I thought we were going to go in so
[24:14] that doesn't bother you any but it
[24:16] bothers me a whole lot amen so I
[24:18] probably shouldn't even tell you because
[24:19] it doesn't make any difference but but
[24:21] for me I get all jumbled up so I'm
[24:24] standing here by faith amen saying God I
[24:27] just trust your leadership and we're
[24:28] asking God to take control and speak his
[24:31] word that he would Minister through a
[24:33] gift Amen brother B said a gift is just
[24:35] to get yourself out of the way and so
[24:37] that's what I'm struggling to do right
[24:38] now is pull it into another gear and get
[24:41] myself relaxed so that God can take over
[24:44] but when we get to this subject this is
[24:46] something that I was reading in my just
[24:47] my daily devotion just my Bible reading
[24:50] and it struck me and I got excited about
[24:52] it I never intended to preach on it I
[24:54] just got excited about it and then
[24:56] yesterday afternoon it started working
[24:58] on and by evening I I knew I had to go
[25:00] this direction but when Paul is asking
[25:03] for prayer he's asking prayer that
[25:05] utterance may be given unto me that I
[25:07] might open my mouth boldly to make known
[25:10] The Mystery of the gospel and that
[25:12] phrase struck my heart he wasn't asking
[25:15] that he would have boldness to preach
[25:17] the gospel but the mystery of the gospel
[25:20] because there's there's a gospel but
[25:22] there's a mystery of the Gospel as well
[25:25] amen and that's what Paul was wanting to
[25:27] get over was the The Mystery of the
[25:29] Gospel that had been given to him and uh
[25:31] and he was preaching in a mystery and
[25:33] it's amazing how many times Paul talks
[25:35] about preaching the mystery the hidden
[25:37] things the mystery that had not been
[25:39] known and now he wants to boldly preach
[25:42] the mystery of the Gospel what he is an
[25:45] ambassador for when we look up this word
[25:47] mystery in the Greek this is the
[25:50] definition that it gives a hidden thing
[25:53] a secret generally Mysteries religious
[25:56] Secrets uh confided only to the
[25:59] initiated and not to ordinary
[26:03] Mortals something about that definition
[26:06] just got my juices going amen uh
[26:10] religious Secrets confided only to the
[26:12] initiated and not to ordinary Mortals
[26:16] hey I don't want to be an ordinary
[26:17] mortal amen I want to be one of the
[26:20] initiated he also says here there's
[26:22] several different definitions I'll read
[26:24] this next one a hidden or secret thing
[26:27] not obvious to the understanding that's
[26:31] why listen we can't intellectually go to
[26:34] the Bible amen and be able to draw these
[26:36] things out amen because it doesn't come
[26:39] that way these things are written in
[26:40] Mysteries it takes the spirit of
[26:42] Revelation Amen to pull out what is not
[26:45] obvious to the understanding I mean we
[26:48] have because of because of of education
[26:51] and because of a translation of the
[26:53] Bible amen there's an intelligence that
[26:55] can give us understanding of words that
[26:57] we read but that won't give you the
[27:00] understanding of the mystery it'll only
[27:02] give you the understanding of the
[27:06] text and understanding the text doesn't
[27:09] equal to understanding the mystery amen
[27:13] amen we'll get into that in a minute the
[27:15] next definition he says a hidden purpose
[27:17] or counsel secret will of men of God the
[27:21] secret councils which govern God in
[27:23] dealing with the righteous which are
[27:25] hidden from ungodly and wicked men but
[27:28] plain to The Godly amen I love these
[27:31] definitions I mean we're just going to
[27:33] preach out of the concordance amen am
[27:36] because these things are not obvious to
[27:39] the understanding and its ways in which
[27:41] God is dealing with his children or his
[27:43] elect amen and it's not known or
[27:46] revealed to the wicked or ungodly but
[27:48] it's made plain to The Godly amen it's
[27:51] something that's not obvious to
[27:53] understanding but it's plain made plain
[27:55] by Revelation to The Godly and that's
[27:57] why for you it's so easy to see the
[27:59] message you just see it you can't help
[28:01] from see it brother bam said once you
[28:03] see this message you can't see anything
[28:05] else to you it's been plainly revealed
[28:08] amen because it was for you amen but it
[28:11] wasn't obvious to understanding that's
[28:13] why when you go to explain it to
[28:14] somebody a coworker a family member they
[28:17] said I just can't get it I just don't
[28:18] know what you're saying it doesn't make
[28:20] sense to me and then all of a sudden you
[28:22] realize the gospel amen you're you're
[28:25] speaking now the mystery of the Gospel
[28:27] yes right not what's on the surface but
[28:31] what's hidden in the text let's go to
[28:35] Ephesians chapter
[28:40] 3 Ephesians chapter 3:
[28:44] 1 for this cause I Paul the prisoner of
[28:47] Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if you
[28:49] have heard of the dispensation of the
[28:51] grace of God which is given me to you
[28:53] word how that by Revelation he may known
[28:56] unto me the mystery as I wrote a four
[28:58] and few words whereby when you read you
[29:00] may understand my knowledge in the
[29:02] mystery of Christ which in other Ages
[29:04] was not made known Unto the Sons of men
[29:07] as it is now revealed unto His Holy
[29:10] Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so
[29:12] now Paul's saying I have a revelation of
[29:16] the mystery of Christ and this is I I
[29:19] you've heard the dispensation of the
[29:20] grace of God which is given to me to you
[29:23] how that by Revelation he made known
[29:24] unto me the mystery so God revealed it
[29:27] them him amen it's a mystery it wasn't
[29:30] something obvious to the understanding
[29:32] and the question is where is Paul going
[29:34] to go to get this mystery amen he's got
[29:37] to go to Christ God's got to reveal to
[29:39] him the mystery amen and then once he
[29:41] gets the mystery then he's going to go
[29:43] back to his Bible and when he goes back
[29:45] to his Bible with the revelation of the
[29:47] mystery he's going to pull it out of the
[29:49] Old Testament amen right amen but he
[29:52] wasn't able to pull it out of the Old
[29:54] Testament before he sat at the feet of
[29:57] gel he he was in the best teaching the
[29:59] best school that he could be in and he
[30:01] wasn't able to pull this mystery himself
[30:04] until he met Christ he met the pillar of
[30:06] fire and he went and learned the mystery
[30:09] of Christ
[30:11] amen and then he went back to the Bible
[30:14] and when he went back to the Bible after
[30:16] his eyes had been open amen then he
[30:19] could see the mystery all through the
[30:22] scriptures praise
[30:24] God now let's read this again verse 5
[30:28] which in other Ages was not made known
[30:30] Unto the Sons of men a as it is now
[30:33] revealed unto His Holy Apostles and
[30:35] Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles
[30:38] should be fellow Hees of the same body
[30:40] and partakers of his promise in Christ
[30:42] by the
[30:44] gospel whereof I was made a minister
[30:47] according to the gift of the grace of
[30:49] God given unto me by the effectual
[30:50] working of his power unto me who am less
[30:53] than the least of All Saints is this
[30:55] Grace given that I should preach among
[30:57] the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[31:00] Christ and to make all men see what is
[31:02] the Fellowship of the mystery which from
[31:04] the beginning of the world has been hid
[31:06] in God who created All Things by Jesus
[31:09] Christ to the intent that now unto the
[31:12] principalities and powers and Heavenly
[31:14] places might be known by the church the
[31:17] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[31:20] Eternal purpose which he purposed in
[31:22] Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have
[31:25] boldness and access with confidence by
[31:27] the faith faith of him praise God let's
[31:31] go to First
[31:36] Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter
[31:51] 2 1 Corinthians chap 2 Verse 6 how be it
[31:56] we speak wisdom among them are perfect
[31:58] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[32:01] the princes of this world that come to
[32:02] not but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[32:06] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[32:09] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[32:11] which none of the princes of this world
[32:13] knew for had they known it they would
[32:15] not have crucified the Lord Of Glory he
[32:18] said they didn't know it if they had
[32:20] known it they would have if they had
[32:21] known the truth of who Jesus Christ was
[32:23] they would have never crucified him but
[32:26] they didn't know but he says we speak
[32:28] the wisdom of God in a mystery now he
[32:31] wanted to he was praying for the
[32:33] Ephesian church amen to pray for him
[32:35] that utterance would be given to him
[32:37] that he could speak boldly The Mystery
[32:39] of the Gospel amen and you can boldly
[32:42] speak the mystery of the Gospel but
[32:44] you're still preaching in a mystery
[32:46] you're still speaking in a mystery amen
[32:48] because it's only for those who have the
[32:50] receptor on the inside that can pick up
[32:52] the mystery because it's not obvious to
[32:54] the
[32:56] understanding amen
[32:58] amen which which makes me thank God
[33:01] Almighty that he put something in me
[33:03] before the foundation of the world a
[33:05] receptor that could receive amen the
[33:07] mystery when the mystery is preached
[33:09] boldly it was preached boldly by the
[33:11] prophet it's been preached boldly by
[33:13] many men amen and it goes over the tops
[33:15] of so many heads but by the grace of God
[33:18] he has put something in his elect seed
[33:20] amen that it won't just go over the head
[33:22] and it won't just rattle around in the
[33:24] head for debate and discussion and
[33:25] confusion but it'll strike a Crystal
[33:28] amen it'll strike a receiver down in the
[33:30] soul that'll say that ain't nothing but
[33:32] the truth amen without the intellect
[33:35] being able to tie all the pieces
[33:37] together something will say that's the
[33:39] truth by the grace of
[33:41] God Amen
[33:44] so let's go to Romans 16
[34:01] Romans
[34:06] 16:25 now to him that is of power now to
[34:09] him that is of power to establish you
[34:12] according to my gospel and the preaching
[34:14] of Jesus Christ according to the
[34:16] revelation of the mystery which was Kept
[34:19] Secret since the world
[34:21] began amen if you want to be established
[34:24] amen you need you need the gospel but
[34:26] you need the re revelation of the
[34:28] mystery amen yes the revelation of the
[34:32] mystery which was Kept Secret since the
[34:35] world began but now is made manifest and
[34:39] by the scriptures of the prophets
[34:41] according to the Commandment of the
[34:42] Everlasting God made known to All
[34:44] Nations for The Obedience of Faith to
[34:46] God only wise be glory through Jesus
[34:48] Christ forever amen amen praise God so
[34:54] now the Apostle
[34:56] Paul the Apostle Paul now is is on a
[34:59] journey he's on a journey to Damascus
[35:02] because he's going to to haul this new
[35:04] sect of these uh of these religious
[35:06] blasphemers those that he thought were
[35:09] polluting and corrupting the word of God
[35:11] and he goes out zealous for the word of
[35:14] God and he gets dispatched with letters
[35:16] from the high priest and from the elders
[35:18] to go and on the way to Damascus he
[35:20] comes in contact with the Lord Jesus
[35:22] Christ and he was in the form of a
[35:24] pillar of fire and it smoted him down to
[35:26] the ground he called out Amen to him and
[35:29] he identified himself that Pillar of
[35:31] Fire was Jesus Christ whom he was
[35:33] persecuting but he wasn't persecuting
[35:35] amen a body a human body that was Jesus
[35:38] Christ was dwelling dwelling in he was
[35:40] persecuting the church that Jesus Christ
[35:42] was dwelling in those were the bodies
[35:44] and and all of a sudden he got a
[35:46] revelation right there and then he went
[35:47] out into the Arabian to the desert to
[35:49] receive the The Mystery of the Bible
[35:52] amen and he received it by Christ
[35:54] himself by Revelation amen because there
[35:56] was a measure of disp sensation of Grace
[35:58] given to him to us word amen then he
[36:02] come out preaching the mystery of the
[36:03] Gospel amen and and even in this day
[36:07] there's so many people that get the
[36:09] gospel but what about the mystery of the
[36:12] Gospel right there's so many people that
[36:14] are hitting a surface level of the
[36:16] gospel and they're understanding that
[36:18] Jesus Christ came and died for Sinners
[36:20] and and that he shed his blood on
[36:21] Calvary to redeem back the world and
[36:23] those that are lost and amen there's a
[36:25] surface of the Gospel but my there's
[36:27] mystery in that amen there's a mystery
[36:29] in Calvary and the Mystery lay inside
[36:32] Jesus Christ while he was nailed to the
[36:34] cross on Calvary there was a mystery in
[36:37] there amen the Apostle Paul comes now
[36:40] when he gets the revelation of this
[36:42] mystery now he's recognizing amen who
[36:45] Christ is that he's the Messiah that all
[36:47] the prophets were speaking of him that
[36:49] everything that was prophesied had now
[36:51] taken place and he's able to go back
[36:53] with his eyes open listen he I I I I I
[36:57] don't understand I don't know how to say
[36:59] it let's just say it this way I don't
[37:00] know how to say what I want to say so
[37:02] you just bear with me for a minute it
[37:04] doesn't work backwards he doesn't study
[37:06] study study study study and all of a
[37:08] sudden know the mystery amen God comes
[37:10] to him and reveals to him the mystery
[37:12] and then when he goes back to the book
[37:14] it all unfolds he can go back amen all
[37:17] those years with Gia all those studying
[37:19] of the Bibles and reading of the Scrolls
[37:21] and the time spent in the in the temple
[37:23] he said he had to count it as dung that
[37:25] he might know and win Christ amen
[37:28] but it doesn't mean now he quit reading
[37:31] his Bible and he gave up on the Scrolls
[37:33] no when he's still in prison amen he's
[37:35] asking I think it is Timothy to come and
[37:37] bring him the parchments and especially
[37:39] the Scrolls he wants his Bible yeah why
[37:42] because his eyes are open and now he can
[37:44] see the mystery that he had missed all
[37:46] of his life and that in ages before they
[37:49] were Godly men they were men of God they
[37:52] were the right kind of man in the right
[37:54] season but this mystery was veiled and
[37:56] they couldn't see it either and neither
[37:58] could the Apostle Paul see it until God
[38:01] lifted the veil off of his eyes amen and
[38:03] then he comes and he starts preaching
[38:05] things that absolutely Rock the
[38:08] foundation of the Jewish World they
[38:10] can't take it they absolutely can't take
[38:13] what he saying he he they they he says
[38:16] you know when he's standing uh uh in the
[38:18] court he says and the way that is called
[38:20] heresy is the way that I worship he
[38:22] didn't say he worshiped by heresy but
[38:24] the way it's called heresy because it
[38:26] was so different amen the their
[38:28] understanding of the Bible that they
[38:30] thought he was a
[38:31] heretic they wanted to kill him and
[38:33] destroy him because they thought he was
[38:35] blaspheming and destroying the the word
[38:37] of God and in their effort to
[38:40] protect the truth yeah right they were
[38:44] trying to kill the one whose eyes was
[38:46] open to the
[38:49] truth see it's not an abundance of study
[38:55] that brings the Revelation the
[38:57] revelation is the grace of God
[38:59] Amen the word must be preached and under
[39:03] the preaching of the word amen there's a
[39:05] there's there's a there's a release of
[39:07] the Revelation and those with a receptor
[39:09] can catch
[39:11] it and and after they catch it they go
[39:16] back say it's right there how did I miss
[39:20] it like you go to the scripture that
[39:23] says amen baptism in the name of the
[39:25] Lord Jesus Christ and and when you go
[39:27] back to Matthew uh 28:19 he said in the
[39:30] name of the father and the son and of
[39:32] the Holy Ghost then all of a sudden when
[39:35] the when the light switch flips you say
[39:37] it says name there's just only one name
[39:40] amen it doesn't say names plural it's
[39:42] just name I mean you wouldn't believe
[39:44] how many people you try to explain that
[39:46] to and you explain it and they say yeah
[39:48] I don't understand he says yeah that's
[39:50] what he said Father Son and Holy Ghost
[39:53] yeah but you say no he said name not
[39:55] names plural name yeah father son I mean
[39:58] because there's got to be a receptor on
[40:00] the inside and all of a sudden when it
[40:02] goes off it just goes off and once you
[40:04] see it you can't see anything else it's
[40:05] just there right amen that's why for me
[40:11] I I I don't I I I don't understand some
[40:16] of the ideology that we have sometimes
[40:18] that we have to make things
[40:21] simple I think the gospel's simple I
[40:25] think the message is simple amen and
[40:27] sometimes when there's an adversion to
[40:29] preaching on Mysteries listen that's all
[40:32] Paul
[40:33] preached Paul preached the mystery that
[40:35] was hid from the foundation of the world
[40:37] but now is made known amen Paul Paul's
[40:41] whole Ministry his whole Ministry was
[40:44] preaching the Mysteries that was veiled
[40:46] in the Old Testament amen amen so so
[40:50] there's not there's there's no need amen
[40:53] for us to say you know don't preach on
[40:55] the Mysteries and don't that that that
[40:57] the message the message is the mystery
[40:59] that was laying in the New
[41:02] Testament amen that's what brother
[41:04] Brandon was called to do is come and
[41:07] break that mystery for us and so that's
[41:10] where I I sometimes I get concerned at
[41:13] the direction sometimes I see things
[41:15] going in a pool to try to bring things
[41:17] down to simplify it and it seems like
[41:20] what we're trying to do sometimes is
[41:22] we're trying to make it obvious to the
[41:25] intellect yeah yeah but a mystery is
[41:28] something that's not obvious to the
[41:30] intellect but it's plainly seen by The
[41:32] Godly amen amen and so so when we have a
[41:37] desire it's like I how can I how can I
[41:40] simplify this so that everybody can
[41:42] catch it well the reality is everybody's
[41:44] not supposed to catch it it's not for
[41:46] everybody to catch it's only for the
[41:50] elect and sometimes we think that if we
[41:52] could simplify it down a little bit or
[41:55] make it a little bit easier or or less
[41:57] complex listen I don't know how to make
[42:00] God less
[42:01] complex he is everything he he feels
[42:04] everything he is everything I don't know
[42:07] amen the message is deep I don't know
[42:08] how to make it shallow amen it's simple
[42:11] but it's deep amen it's so easy to
[42:14] understand there's things in it I still
[42:15] don't understand I don't know how to
[42:18] change that that's just the word of God
[42:20] that's the same thing with the Bible I
[42:22] read it's deep it's complex it goes
[42:24] everywhere it involves every facet of
[42:26] life and there's layers to scriptures
[42:28] that keep going deeper you get a Surface
[42:30] layer of the scripture you read it again
[42:32] and it goes deeper then you hear brother
[42:34] brandham saying something and he ties it
[42:35] to something completely different and it
[42:37] goes deeper yet I don't know how to
[42:39] change
[42:40] that that's the way the word of God is
[42:43] that's right thank you Lord amen and so
[42:47] I believe that what I want to do with
[42:49] all my heart is take the Revelation
[42:52] God's given me and and and preach it as
[42:54] clearly as I know how God amen but as
[42:57] clearly as I know how it's still going
[43:00] to be a
[43:02] mystery and Paul was preaching the
[43:05] mystery of the gospel and we're still
[43:08] preaching the mystery of the
[43:11] Gospel
[43:12] amen Paul now comes
[43:15] along and he starts taking the Bible and
[43:18] doing things with it that rocked the
[43:20] religious
[43:21] world he comes now and he starts to take
[43:25] the
[43:26] scripture and show them that the Seed of
[43:30] Abraham includes
[43:32] Gentiles yes do you know how
[43:36] unbelievable that Doctrine was yeah they
[43:40] these are people we you know we're
[43:42] standing here having the benefit of
[43:44] 2,000 years of church history we've
[43:46] known that it's obvious it's been taught
[43:47] since you're child you've heard the
[43:49] scripture over and over but if you were
[43:50] there in Paul's day all you've ever
[43:52] known is God selected a man named
[43:54] Abraham and he had a physical seed
[43:56] through Isaac and that seed lineage is
[43:58] the chosen of God and they're the only
[44:00] ones chosen of God Amen and if anybody
[44:03] else wants anything to do with God
[44:04] they've got to come here to these chosen
[44:06] of God who is the light to the world and
[44:08] if they come and and they proelite
[44:10] themselves among them then they can be
[44:11] accepted also but this is the only place
[44:14] yes where the election is yeah that
[44:17] right amen that's that's what the Jews
[44:20] understood now the Apostle Paul comes
[44:22] and says they're not all Israel that is
[44:24] Israel but but in the promise my seed be
[44:28] and and unto Isaac and now he's saying
[44:30] it's not the natural anymore you think
[44:33] it's natural you think because you can
[44:35] chase your lineage back and you can find
[44:37] Abraham back there somewhere that you're
[44:39] part of the elect but he says no the
[44:41] election isn't like that amen now the
[44:44] election is now not identified through a
[44:46] birth record but the election is
[44:48] identified by faith am those in the
[44:51] Gentiles who are able to believe the
[44:53] mystery of the Gospel amen have evidence
[44:56] that they are the Seed of Abraham
[44:58] because they have the faith of their
[45:00] father Abraham what was the faith of
[45:02] Abraham Abraham was able to believe what
[45:05] God told him for his day amen when God
[45:08] came and gave him a message he believed
[45:09] it when others doubted it he believed it
[45:12] when things went wrong he believed it
[45:15] and he became the father of Faith to the
[45:17] faithful amen that are the Seed of
[45:19] Abraham and that seed Paul tells us is
[45:22] not many as in seeds but singular one
[45:25] which is Christ so now the Seed of
[45:27] Abraham is Christ the anointed word amen
[45:30] and then the Apostle Paul comes and says
[45:33] now you by faith are Seed of
[45:36] Abraham now what does that make me that
[45:39] makes me part of Christ
[45:42] am the Jews couldn't handle
[45:46] this you know what they kept
[45:48] saying the Bible
[45:51] says the Bible says the Bible says the
[45:55] Bible says the Bible
[45:58] says what were they fighting Paul with
[46:02] the
[46:03] Bible the Old Testament the law and the
[46:07] prophets when they were disputing with
[46:09] Jesus they kept going back Moses
[46:14] said so Paul they and but Paul knew
[46:18] where he stood because he saw the
[46:20] mystery by Revelation and he kept
[46:23] breaking it down amen and preaching the
[46:25] mystery of the Gospel which now amen was
[46:28] showing that Messiah had come and was
[46:31] slain paid the price for the Redemption
[46:33] and now the the gospel is going to the
[46:36] Gentiles and he starts he starts going
[46:38] to all the prophecies that were in the
[46:41] Old Testament showing this to be
[46:44] true he starts preaching predestination
[46:47] and
[46:48] election different than they understood
[46:50] predestination and election amen they
[46:53] understood it by God's choice in Abraham
[46:56] and then God's choice in Isaac and then
[46:59] they were all
[47:00] included and Paul begins to strip that
[47:05] away that was known to be the truth for
[47:09] so
[47:10] long but here comes a man saying that he
[47:14] got a revelation of the mystery of the
[47:16] Bible and he begins to change everything
[47:19] that they held to be
[47:25] true he started preaching that Mount
[47:29] Zion was
[47:32] spiritual not
[47:34] physical he started saying that New
[47:36] Jerusalem is your
[47:38] mother and it's not the one that's on
[47:41] Earth but it's the one from Heaven that
[47:43] now
[47:44] counts he started preaching circumcision
[47:48] is the circumcision of the heart not of
[47:50] the outward
[47:52] flesh listen I
[47:54] mean if if we would have been good
[47:57] Pharisees in the day that he started
[47:59] saying that we would have opened the
[48:02] scroll and went to the scripture and
[48:04] showed where God told Moses to tell
[48:07] Israel to take every male that's born on
[48:10] the eighth day and have him circumcised
[48:12] and that's exactly Verbatim what the
[48:14] Bible says and there's no wiggle room we
[48:17] understand Hebrew yeah
[48:20] right but Paul now comes along and
[48:23] listen I'm I'm telling you if if if if
[48:26] if you were a common Jew in the day not
[48:29] an elect not a c Gene of God but just a
[48:31] Jew there is no way that you could take
[48:34] what this man is saying there's
[48:35] absolutely no way because what he's
[48:37] saying is so astronomically different
[48:39] than what you've believed all your life
[48:40] about the Bible but he's claiming to be
[48:42] preaching the Bible and that there was a
[48:44] mystery in that Bible and he's preaching
[48:46] the mystery out of that Bible and you
[48:48] don't want his mystery because you want
[48:50] to stay with the black Black Ink on
[48:52] white
[48:54] paper because it's what you known all of
[48:56] your
[48:58] life but Paul had the mystery of the
[49:01] Gospel amen it was revealed unto him and
[49:04] praise God we have the mystery of the
[49:06] Gospel been restored to us in this end
[49:08] time and the same thing that Paul did is
[49:10] the same thing that happened in brother
[49:12] branam it was an absolute repeat of the
[49:15] ministry of apostle Paul let's go to
[49:17] Revelation 10 together
[49:27] everything that they had physical Paul
[49:30] turned it
[49:32] spiritual they had a physical Israel he
[49:35] made it a spiritual Israel they had a
[49:38] physical seed he made it a spiritual
[49:40] seed they had a physical circumcision he
[49:42] made it a spiritual circumcision they
[49:44] had a physical Jerusalem he made it a
[49:46] spiritual Jerusalem
[49:49] amen can you see how hard it was to
[49:52] believe Paul's message in his day
[49:57] it wasn't
[49:59] obvious to the
[50:01] intellect it was only obvious to the
[50:04] seed of
[50:06] God even even Peter when Peter is trying
[50:10] to understand what Jesus is saying he's
[50:12] not comprehending what Jesus is saying
[50:14] and Jesus intentionally is not making it
[50:16] plain yeah is that right he's
[50:20] intentionally not making it plain he's
[50:22] not making it easily understood Jesus is
[50:25] saying things that are so Absol
[50:26] absolutely contrary to Common
[50:28] understanding and to their intellect
[50:30] when he says eat my flesh and drink my
[50:32] blood I mean there's no way they could
[50:34] comprehend what he was actually talking
[50:36] about and he was speaking spiritually
[50:37] they were understanding naturally and
[50:39] even his disciples didn't understand but
[50:41] there was something different down in
[50:43] Peter that says hey I don't know he says
[50:46] will you go also he says to whom will we
[50:47] go I I don't know and brother man said
[50:49] he said I don't know what you're talking
[50:51] about but to where else will we go but
[50:53] we believe and are sure that that thou
[50:55] art Christ the son of the Living God and
[50:57] thou has thou alone has the words of
[50:59] eternal life yeah he got that where did
[51:02] he get that understanding that came from
[51:04] inside of him that was a revelation
[51:06] given to him by God because he was a
[51:08] predestinated seed Gene of God and he
[51:11] was able to catch something although his
[51:13] intellect couldn't catch and decipher
[51:16] what Jesus was saying something inside
[51:18] of him said I have no place else to go
[51:20] this is the truth amen and if you ask
[51:23] him to explain what was true about it he
[51:25] couldn't even tell you what was true
[51:26] about the statement cuz he didn't know
[51:28] what was true about it all he know is
[51:30] this is the Son of God and he alone has
[51:32] the words of eternal
[51:34] life he got that by Revelation that came
[51:37] not by flesh and
[51:39] blood but direct Revelation from the
[51:42] father amen so Paul was there absolutely
[51:47] tearing apart what they thought was the
[51:50] Gospel for
[51:51] them and he was doing things
[51:58] that that technically weren't
[52:02] right but spiritually were correct
[52:05] amen oh praise God Amen that's why if if
[52:12] Jesus could preach the Mysteries and not
[52:16] reveal it because he knew there would
[52:17] come a time that it would be revealed
[52:20] Paul preached The Mystery of the gospel
[52:22] and he wanted to make it plain but yet
[52:24] he says but we preach the Mi we we we
[52:26] preach the gospel in Mysteries we preach
[52:28] the truth in Mysteries because the man's
[52:31] mind is darkened only those that can
[52:33] receive spiritual Revelation are going
[52:34] to understand Paul's
[52:37] Ministry and so when when there's a when
[52:40] there's a Temptation or a pressure to
[52:43] water down the message and just stick
[52:45] with maybe the simpler things and not go
[52:47] into the Mysteries and not go into the
[52:48] deep things amen my my my concern is why
[52:53] can't we just preach the way brother
[52:54] Brandon preached
[52:56] why can't we use the terminology he used
[52:59] they say why do you use this terminology
[53:01] why do you use these words they're hard
[53:03] to understand well God delivered it to
[53:05] us that way that's the way God brought
[53:07] the message and God knew that the could
[53:10] understand that language and he used he
[53:12] used a man with a seventh grade
[53:13] education who didn't always get his
[53:15] words right amen and he said brother bam
[53:17] said one time he says I hope you get
[53:19] what I'm trying to say he goes I don't
[53:21] have education enough to explain it but
[53:23] I know what I'm talking about knows what
[53:26] he's talking about but doesn't have
[53:28] education enough to explain it why would
[53:30] God do something like that because God's
[53:33] not trying to get it over to make it
[53:35] obvious to the intellect he's trying to
[53:37] get it to his
[53:38] children remember in Romans he made it
[53:41] amen Made It by faith there that it
[53:43] could be by grace to the to the promise
[53:46] so that the promise would be sure to the
[53:49] elect amen amen so the Temptation amen
[53:53] just to make it simple and don't talk
[53:54] about Mysteries and don't talk about all
[53:56] these things my goodness if that's the
[53:58] way God delivered the message who am I
[54:01] to doctor it up and fancify it and make
[54:03] it pretty why can't I just say what the
[54:06] prophet said and why is that not good
[54:08] enough amen I I tell you it will be good
[54:11] enough it is good enough because the
[54:13] message is here amen it is the mystery
[54:16] of the
[54:18] gospel and it's here to awaken a a group
[54:21] of people right and to them it's plain
[54:27] doesn't mean they can explain it doesn't
[54:29] mean they can chart it any more than
[54:32] Peter could all it means is to them it's
[54:35] plain what's plain this is the
[54:38] truth that's plain what else is plain in
[54:42] that I don't know but I know this is
[54:43] plain that's the
[54:45] truth there's so many things there's so
[54:47] many things brother Bram said I I still
[54:49] don't understand I don't know why he
[54:51] worded it that way I don't know why he
[54:52] phrased it that way I don't know why he
[54:54] said it but but it doesn't matter he's
[54:57] still the truth the message is true he's
[55:00] still the vessel that God sent and and I
[55:02] believe that he preached to us the
[55:04] mystery of the
[55:06] Gospel let's go to Revelation chap
[55:11] 10 now before we read Revelation chap 10
[55:15] let's read Revelation
[55:22] 8:1 and when he had opened the seventh
[55:25] seal there was silence in heaven about
[55:27] the space of half an
[55:29] hour this is the opening of the seventh
[55:31] seal it's a mystery because there's no
[55:34] symbols given all we have is silence all
[55:38] we know is it was opened but we don't
[55:40] know what happened it wasn't made
[55:43] plain to us we go over to Revelation 10
[55:47] 1:7 and brother brandham attaches
[55:50] Revelation 81 and Revelation 101:7 and
[55:54] makes them the same thing the opening of
[55:55] the
[55:57] seal in verse one says I saw another
[56:00] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[56:02] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[56:04] upon his head and his face was as it
[56:06] were the Sun and his feet of pillars of
[56:08] fire and he had in his hand a little
[56:11] book open and he set his right foot upon
[56:13] the sea and his left foot upon the Earth
[56:15] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[56:17] lion Roth and when he had cried seven
[56:20] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[56:22] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[56:24] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[56:26] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[56:28] up those things which the seven Thunders
[56:30] uttered and write them not and the angel
[56:33] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[56:35] the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[56:37] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[56:40] ever who created heaven and the things
[56:42] that therein are and the earth and the
[56:44] things that therein are and the Sea and
[56:46] the things which are therein that there
[56:48] should be time no longer but in the days
[56:51] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[56:52] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[56:55] God should be finished finished as he
[56:57] had declared to his servants the
[56:59] prophets amen the Apostle Paul preached
[57:01] to us the mystery of the Gospel brother
[57:04] brandham was going to bring To Us by the
[57:06] grace of God the mystery of
[57:09] God in the end time we see here that
[57:13] that seven Thunders uttered their voices
[57:15] I know you know this but I just want I I
[57:17] feel to review it amen seven Thunders
[57:19] had uttered their voices and John was
[57:21] about to write because whatever they
[57:23] uttered was was intelligible he could
[57:26] understand what they said he heard the
[57:27] voice and he was able to write down what
[57:29] was said in that voice so he understood
[57:32] so the the Thunders was some sort of
[57:35] speech words that he could write down
[57:38] and when he was about to write them down
[57:41] a voice told him write not but seal it
[57:43] up amen and brother R talks about this
[57:45] we're going to get to this in several
[57:46] places he talks about it was sealed up
[57:49] but it was sealed up like Daniel was
[57:51] told that the Revelation was sealed up
[57:52] to the time of the end it's going to be
[57:54] sealed up to the time of the end but God
[57:56] doesn't want it to always remain sealed
[57:59] up to his elect but there's coming a
[58:01] time that he's going to unseal this
[58:02] portion of scripture to his elect
[58:04] children praise God and in the days of
[58:08] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[58:10] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[58:13] should be
[58:15] finished so we find that these this is
[58:18] what the prophet says I'm just going to
[58:19] read a few quotes this is the message is
[58:21] this the sign of the end sir this is the
[58:24] message he preached amen after he had
[58:27] the experience of spiritually getting
[58:29] caught up in a constellation in his
[58:30] bedroom there amen and seeing the the
[58:33] little the little doves come or the
[58:35] little birds and then the little doves
[58:36] and then the constellation of angels and
[58:38] it nearly packed him out of the room and
[58:40] and then people were coming to him for
[58:42] for the last couple of months bringing
[58:44] dreams to him he had six dreams and then
[58:46] he had this this vision and then he knew
[58:49] now because they were going to widen his
[58:51] road and that was a vision he had been
[58:53] given and they were going to tear it out
[58:54] and widen the road and he knew by that
[58:56] that it was time for him to go west so
[58:58] he comes and starts preaching on
[59:00] December 30th 1962 he preaches this
[59:03] message is this the sign of the answerer
[59:06] and he says It's On The Backs side when
[59:08] a book is completed not not did he say
[59:11] on the front side he said On The Backs
[59:13] side after it's all done completed then
[59:15] these seven Thunders voices is the only
[59:18] thing that stuck to the book that's not
[59:21] revealed it's not even written in the
[59:24] book this is Brother brand
[59:26] understanding of the seven
[59:28] Thunders because he sees the Seven Seals
[59:31] when you go to Revelation chap 6 he sees
[59:33] when the first one was open a a a white
[59:36] horse went forth and a rider went on it
[59:38] and he sees the symbology so he knows
[59:40] that it's open in symbol form he there's
[59:43] so there Seven Seals and there's symbols
[59:45] that go along with it that's in the
[59:47] Bible but then there's seven Thunders
[59:49] over here in Revelation 10 which he
[59:51] calls the back part of the book and
[59:54] there's not nothing's written about him
[59:55] at all all they're not even revealed and
[59:58] he says it's not even written in the
[1:00:01] book this is Brother brenham's
[1:00:03] understanding now we're going to see his
[1:00:04] understanding is going to change but
[1:00:06] this is his understanding and then in
[1:00:08] the first says and then there's coming
[1:00:10] forth seven mysterious Thunders that's
[1:00:12] not even written at all we just read it
[1:00:15] there and that's right and I believe
[1:00:18] that through these seven Thunders we'll
[1:00:19] be revealed in the last days in order to
[1:00:22] get the bride together for rapturing
[1:00:23] Faith because what we got right now we
[1:00:26] wouldn't be able to do it there's
[1:00:28] something we've got to step farther we
[1:00:30] can't have enough faith for Divine
[1:00:32] Healing hardly so the prophet of God
[1:00:34] saying we need something more than we
[1:00:36] have now and what we need is going to
[1:00:39] bring a a rapturing faith to the bride
[1:00:41] and it's going to come at the revelation
[1:00:42] of those seven seven Thunders amen which
[1:00:46] are what the unwritten portion the
[1:00:50] unrevealed he said he goes on to say in
[1:00:53] in the same message and the Seven
[1:00:55] Thunders right in the Revelation here of
[1:00:57] Jesus Christ it's some mystery does not
[1:00:59] the bible say that this is the
[1:01:01] revelation of Jesus Christ why there is
[1:01:03] some hidden Mystery then of it hm what
[1:01:06] is it the seven Thunders have it for
[1:01:09] John was just about to write and a voice
[1:01:11] came down from heaven said don't write
[1:01:13] it but seal it seal it up put it on the
[1:01:15] back side of the book it's got to be
[1:01:17] revealed it's the Mysteries so here he's
[1:01:20] saying the same thing it's not even
[1:01:22] written it's sealed up it's on the back
[1:01:24] side of the book and this is his
[1:01:26] understanding before the opening of the
[1:01:27] seals but we're going to find that at
[1:01:29] the opening of the seals his
[1:01:30] understanding
[1:01:32] changes he's saying it's something
[1:01:34] that's not written in the Bible at all
[1:01:35] he said there's not one word written
[1:01:37] about it it's some Revelation that has
[1:01:39] to be given amen then there's nothing
[1:01:41] written about it and what he's saying is
[1:01:43] true in the seven Thunders it it was it
[1:01:45] was spoke but nothing was written John
[1:01:47] was told not to write it's sealed up
[1:01:49] that's what he's calling the other set
[1:01:51] of seals those seven mysterious seals
[1:01:54] those seals on the back side of the book
[1:01:55] that's all the way he refers to it and
[1:01:57] he says not written in the Bible at all
[1:02:00] but now in 1965 we come to the Rapture
[1:02:02] message and he says now the book was
[1:02:04] written but then remember it was sealed
[1:02:06] with Seven Seals and these Seven Seals
[1:02:09] was not to be open Revelation 10 until
[1:02:11] the sounding of the last Earthly angel
[1:02:13] on Earth Revelation 10:7 see and in the
[1:02:16] days of the sounding of the last Angel's
[1:02:18] message seventh angel the mystery of God
[1:02:21] should be finished in that age that and
[1:02:23] that's the age that we're living in
[1:02:27] we all know we're living in the leoa age
[1:02:29] there will never be another age to it it
[1:02:31] can't be so we're living in the leoa age
[1:02:34] and these Seven Seals that's held that
[1:02:36] book is a mystery to people should be
[1:02:39] open at that day that's what he promised
[1:02:42] now it won't be nothing outside the word
[1:02:46] because you can't add to the word or
[1:02:48] take from the word it's got to remain
[1:02:51] always the word but the Revelation is to
[1:02:53] reveal the truth of it what it is to to
[1:02:55] make it fit with the rest of scriptures
[1:02:58] here the prophet of God just changed his
[1:03:00] understanding at first his understanding
[1:03:02] was it's not written in the Bible at all
[1:03:04] but after the seals are open he says no
[1:03:06] it's got to be written in the Bible it's
[1:03:09] got to be laying in there but it's
[1:03:11] unrevealed it's in mystery form nobody
[1:03:13] knew what it was but in the end time
[1:03:15] he's going to take the seals off of it
[1:03:17] and reveal it because you can't add one
[1:03:19] word or take one word away so it's got
[1:03:22] to be a mystery that's in the gospel
[1:03:25] it's got to already be there but in the
[1:03:27] end time there's coming another mystery
[1:03:29] that'll give us an understanding of the
[1:03:31] Bible just like the mystery that Paul
[1:03:33] had gave him an understanding of the Old
[1:03:35] Testament now there's going to be a
[1:03:37] mystery revealed that's going to unlock
[1:03:39] the New Testament and the entire Bible
[1:03:41] amen now he says in the seventh seal now
[1:03:45] you remember it was in the pyramid you
[1:03:47] remember the vision of Junior Jackson's
[1:03:50] pyramid in junior Jackson's pyramid he
[1:03:52] saw at the top of a great Hill there was
[1:03:54] a great Rock like a pyramid shame and it
[1:03:56] had writing inscribed on the outside
[1:03:59] like hieroglyphics and brother Brenham
[1:04:01] was going around with the brothers and
[1:04:02] he was interpreta interpreting the
[1:04:04] writing Amen on the outside of the Rock
[1:04:07] and when he got done he reached in the
[1:04:08] air and grabbed a sharp tool like a
[1:04:10] crowbar ripped the top of it off and
[1:04:13] inside was white granite rock and he
[1:04:15] said lights never shown on this before
[1:04:18] and he said it was it was White Rock
[1:04:20] Unwritten
[1:04:22] word Unwritten word nothing written just
[1:04:25] like like the seven
[1:04:27] Thunders now listen what he says now it
[1:04:30] was in the pyramid where the mysterious
[1:04:32] White Rock was not written on and the
[1:04:35] angels took me in the Pyramid of
[1:04:36] themselves now he's attaching that dream
[1:04:39] to getting caught up in that
[1:04:40] constellation of seven
[1:04:41] angels out in sunset
[1:04:44] Mountain he says and the angels took me
[1:04:47] into the Pyramid of themselves the
[1:04:49] mysteries of God known only to them and
[1:04:52] now they with the messengers that come
[1:04:54] to interpret that period
[1:04:56] or that message of the secret of these
[1:04:58] Seven Seals which lays with inside the
[1:05:02] pyramid inside the pyramid where on the
[1:05:05] White Rock with nothing written on it
[1:05:07] where light has there's never been a
[1:05:09] revelation of this yet because it's the
[1:05:11] seven Thunders it's the part that John
[1:05:13] was told not to write it's sealed up
[1:05:15] where is it sealed it's in the rock of
[1:05:18] Revelation it's in the word of God Amen
[1:05:20] and outside was writing everybody could
[1:05:23] read first seal White Horse second seal
[1:05:25] amen black or red horse third seal they
[1:05:28] could read that they could go on the
[1:05:30] outside and read that they could read uh
[1:05:32] about the atonement and Redemption and
[1:05:34] and salvation and blood of Jesus Christ
[1:05:36] and the Messiah they were reading all of
[1:05:38] that but they didn't know that inside
[1:05:40] this pyramid there's something that's a
[1:05:43] mystery that's been hidden in the Bible
[1:05:45] in the entire Bible has had a white
[1:05:48] unrevealed light never shined on this
[1:05:51] mystery
[1:05:53] before it was sealed
[1:05:56] who unsealed it amen that crowbar came
[1:05:59] into the hand of the Prophet Amen to
[1:06:01] take the top off why because in Sabino
[1:06:03] Canon the sword came into his hand which
[1:06:05] is the word of God and he took the word
[1:06:07] of God and opened up the mystery of the
[1:06:10] Bible so that we could see the great
[1:06:12] mystery that's been laying through the
[1:06:14] entire Bible what is it it's the mystery
[1:06:16] of the Gospel it's the mystery of the
[1:06:18] Bible it's the great mystery that was in
[1:06:20] the back part of God's mind that he held
[1:06:22] the entire time and it revealed to us
[1:06:25] the plan that God had from before the
[1:06:27] foundation of the
[1:06:29] world
[1:06:33] Amen he says then we go back to S is
[1:06:36] this is this the sign of the in sir so
[1:06:40] you
[1:06:41] notice even brother brenham's title is
[1:06:44] this the sign of the end
[1:06:46] sir why is he asking is this the sign of
[1:06:49] the end because this mystery has to be
[1:06:52] sealed until the end so he's asking is
[1:06:55] is this the sign of the end that seventh
[1:06:58] seal Amen brother bam called it the end
[1:07:00] time
[1:07:01] seal so that seven seal which is
[1:07:03] revelation 10: 1-7 can't be open till
[1:07:06] the end time and mean now he has these
[1:07:09] dreams that are given to him that he has
[1:07:11] the interpretation of he's got the the
[1:07:13] warning by Vision to go out west he gets
[1:07:15] caught up in a constellation of Angels
[1:07:17] by Vision in his room all of this is
[1:07:19] marking go back West for the revelation
[1:07:21] of the Seven Seals and he's asking is
[1:07:23] this it is this the the sign of the end
[1:07:27] sir amen and he answers his own question
[1:07:30] in this message yes it is the sign of
[1:07:32] the end because these things are sealed
[1:07:34] up until the time of the end just like
[1:07:36] he told Daniel and at the unsealing of
[1:07:39] them marks the end time it's over for
[1:07:42] the
[1:07:43] Gentiles now back again and is this a
[1:07:45] sign of the insert you notice the
[1:07:47] writing was on the Rocks I was
[1:07:49] interpreting it for them they were
[1:07:51] elated that's the mystery of God that's
[1:07:54] been not understood for years could that
[1:07:57] be that and then notice in some
[1:07:59] mysterious way we picked up out of the
[1:08:01] air a sharp tool that opened up the top
[1:08:04] and in there was white granite but it
[1:08:06] wasn't
[1:08:07] interpreted there was no letters I
[1:08:10] didn't interpret that Junior I just
[1:08:12] looked at it and said to the Brethren

[1:08:16] this listen so he's interpreting the
[1:08:18] dream right here in the pool
[1:08:20] pit the the pyramid the opening the top
[1:08:24] the White Rock
[1:08:26] and he says I told the brothers look on

[1:08:32] went out
[1:08:33] west because he's preaching now Serv as
[1:08:36] as a sign he's letting us know that
[1:08:39] there's a mystery to be revealed in the
[1:08:41] seven thunders in the Bible and he's
[1:08:43] saying look on this and he's telling the
[1:08:45] whole church I'm going out west God's

[1:08:58] fulfilled tonight amen that dream was
[1:09:02] fulfilled and S is this the sign of the
[1:09:04] end or is this the sign of the end s

[1:09:18] while they were studying that I slipped
[1:09:20] towards the West what for maybe to
[1:09:24] understand the interpretation of what's
[1:09:26] written in the top of this could it
[1:09:30] be I told you he answers his own
[1:09:32] question in here absolutely this is what
[1:09:34] he's going out west for and those

[1:09:42] the constellation in Sabino Canyon till
[1:09:45] I raised up in the air as high as this
[1:09:47] building that constellation of angels
[1:09:49] seven angels in the form of a pyramid is
[1:09:51] that them Thunders that's coming forth
[1:09:54] could it be
[1:09:56] I'm sorry yeah he's talking this is not
[1:09:59] talking about saino can is talking about
[1:10:01] in his room the vision he just had a
[1:10:03] week earlier is that them Thunders
[1:10:06] that's coming forth could it be whenever
[1:10:08] he says could it be just say yes because
[1:10:11] now we know the rest of the story could
[1:10:13] it be yes could it be that I'm going out
[1:10:15] to get the interpretation yes could it
[1:10:17] be that these seven th yes is this the
[1:10:19] sign of the end sir yes it is the sign
[1:10:22] of the end we are in the end time amen
[1:10:24] we're at the end of the Gentile
[1:10:26] dispensation Church ages has ended we
[1:10:28] are
[1:10:29] here amen he said this is all
[1:10:33] interpreted according to his dream it
[1:10:34] was all finished according to God's word
[1:10:36] the seventh Messenger will finish
[1:10:39] seventh message will be finished and
[1:10:41] then the seven
[1:10:43] Thunders praise God let's go to
[1:10:45] Colossians chapter
[1:10:48] 4 I don't care how many times I review
[1:10:52] this it Thrills my soul amen why cuz
[1:10:55] what brother Bam's doing is he's coming
[1:10:57] in here to the Bible amen and God Amen
[1:11:00] brought him up into that pyramid the
[1:11:02] constellation of angels Amen to the
[1:11:04] Revelation known only to them to what to
[1:11:07] the place the lights never shined before
[1:11:08] to the Granite White Rock what is what
[1:11:11] is a right Rock it's a word it's a
[1:11:13] revelation of the word amen but
[1:11:14] nothing's written on it it's a mystery
[1:11:16] it's a secret and it's inside the word
[1:11:19] and brother B's not saying it's outside
[1:11:21] the word anymore now he knows it's in
[1:11:23] the word it's just been missed for all
[1:11:25] these Generations the church ages missed
[1:11:27] it amen but it's not going to be missed
[1:11:29] anymore because God bought a prophet
[1:11:31] just like the Apostle Paul who's
[1:11:33] preaching to us the mystery of the
[1:11:35] Gospel amen can go back and pull it all
[1:11:38] out Colossians chapter 4 verse
[1:11:43] three he
[1:11:45] says with all praying also for us that
[1:11:48] God will open unto us a door of
[1:11:50] utterance to speak the mystery of Christ
[1:11:53] for which I am also in
[1:11:55] bonds Paul was preaching the mystery of
[1:11:59] Christ let's go to Colossians chapter
[1:12:03] 1 this one's super familiar to us this
[1:12:07] comes out of brother benham's opening
[1:12:09] context in Colossians 1 he reads from 15
[1:12:12] all the way down to 29 when he preaches
[1:12:14] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:12:15] but I'd like to pick it up just at verse
[1:12:18] 25 whereof I am made a minister
[1:12:21] according to the dispensation of God
[1:12:22] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[1:12:24] the word of God even the mystery which
[1:12:27] has been hid from ages and from
[1:12:29] Generations but now is made manifest to
[1:12:31] his Saints to whom God would make known
[1:12:33] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:12:36] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:12:39] Christ in you the hope of
[1:12:41] glory this was the mystery that Paul was
[1:12:44] beginning to
[1:12:46] preach and this
[1:12:48] mystery remained a mystery through the
[1:12:50] church
[1:12:51] ages but in the end time at the opening
[1:12:54] of The Seven Seals
[1:12:56] he came back to show us what was inside
[1:12:58] the
[1:13:01] book amen there's so many things that I
[1:13:03] I want to share on
[1:13:05] that brother brandham said that this
[1:13:08] Bible is the Book of
[1:13:10] Life right he called it the book of life
[1:13:14] he called it a book of
[1:13:16] redemption he called the book in the
[1:13:19] hand of him that sth on the throne in
[1:13:21] Revelations 4 he called that the Book of
[1:13:24] Life
[1:13:27] right he called that our marriage
[1:13:31] certificate they asked him what you ask
[1:13:34] him what was in that book in his hand
[1:13:36] and it was
[1:13:37] names what kind of names names of the
[1:13:41] elect amen and he said now he's calling
[1:13:45] names but he's not calling names like
[1:13:47] reading off a list he's not calling
[1:13:50] names like John Doe and and he's not
[1:13:53] doing that but he's revealing the
[1:13:55] Mysteries as he's calling those names
[1:13:57] amen because if your name is in that
[1:14:00] book then you're in this
[1:14:03] book and then he tells us and what is
[1:14:06] the Believers they're the words in the
[1:14:08] book amen and so what is the book it's
[1:14:11] the record of Christ it's the marriage
[1:14:14] certificate it's the book of life it's
[1:14:17] the book of redemption it's all the same
[1:14:19] thing so that book that was in the hand
[1:14:21] of him that sth on the throne that book
[1:14:24] was sealed and to be open amen and that
[1:14:26] opened the book of life it opened uh the
[1:14:29] book of redemption it opened the
[1:14:30] marriage certificate it opened the the
[1:14:33] record of the family of God it opened
[1:14:35] all of those things it opened that and
[1:14:37] when it opened that it also opened
[1:14:40] this amen and then when it opened this
[1:14:43] then you could see yourself in the word
[1:14:46] now now you could see I'm part of this
[1:14:49] we're not looking down to try to find
[1:14:51] our name like Chad Lamb I'm trying to
[1:14:54] find my ident identification who I
[1:14:56] really am in the word and I couldn't do
[1:14:59] it amen just in the church age Doctrine
[1:15:01] anymore cuz we come to the time for the
[1:15:03] revealing of the Mysteries and now he
[1:15:05] come and he pulled apart now the he he's
[1:15:07] trying to do away with all the guess
[1:15:09] work and reading this and saying I think
[1:15:11] I am maybe I'm saved I put my faith in
[1:15:14] Christ but then I made a mistake the
[1:15:15] other day and now there's Calvinism now
[1:15:17] there's Armenian ISM and them I always
[1:15:19] saved or did I make a mistake and now
[1:15:21] there's always an identity crisis down
[1:15:23] through the church ages but he cometh
[1:15:24] the end of time to peel the seals away
[1:15:27] so that he could come back and show us
[1:15:28] the mystery that is in this Bible and
[1:15:30] the Mystery is not you hopefully will be
[1:15:32] saved the mystery is not if you're a
[1:15:34] good boy you'll be saved but the mystery
[1:15:36] is you were part of God from before the
[1:15:38] foundation of the world that's the White
[1:15:40] Rock that's on the inside it's the
[1:15:42] mystery of God himself as he decided to
[1:15:45] portion himself out over time to reveal
[1:15:48] his great mystery of himself and pull it
[1:15:50] back together at the end time so that he
[1:15:52] could pull everything together in Christ
[1:15:54] that which is in heaven and in Earth all
[1:15:57] in
[1:15:59] him amen this isn't about being deep
[1:16:02] this isn't about being revelated this is
[1:16:04] about your identification it's about
[1:16:07] looking in the mirror of God's word and
[1:16:09] saying mama that's me that's me I was
[1:16:12] part of God I come from God I'm going
[1:16:15] back to God I'm not afraid of not making
[1:16:18] the rater I'm not afraid of falling
[1:16:19] apart I'm Not Afraid why because he's
[1:16:22] revealed to me my part in the book
[1:16:26] when the book was sealed I was sealed in
[1:16:28] the book when the book was unsealed my
[1:16:31] identity was
[1:16:33] unsealed to take away fear and scare and
[1:16:37] all these tactics of the
[1:16:40] devil amen is it simple is it plain to
[1:16:44] you oh my goodness we can go into all
[1:16:48] kinds of details that'll make your head
[1:16:49] spin and my head spin amen there's so
[1:16:51] many details why it's the revelation of
[1:16:54] Jesus Christ how you going to put it how
[1:16:56] you going to boil it down to three words
[1:16:58] he's all and in
[1:17:00] all you could talk about it forever he's
[1:17:03] going to be unfolding himself throughout
[1:17:05] eternity we can talk about it from every
[1:17:07] angle you want to talk about it we can
[1:17:09] use all kinds of language and words we
[1:17:11] can never come to the end of it but when
[1:17:13] you boil it all down it keeps coming
[1:17:15] back to the same Revelation that you are
[1:17:17] part of God you were with him before the
[1:17:19] foundation of the world you were in his
[1:17:21] mind that mystery that he had in the
[1:17:23] back part of his mind included you as an
[1:17:25] individual and he come to the end time
[1:17:28] to take the seals off so that you could
[1:17:30] see who you really
[1:17:32] are
[1:17:34] amen praise
[1:17:37] God is it simple Yes is it complex yes
[1:17:43] is it easy to understand yes is it deep
[1:17:45] Beyond understanding yes amen prise Lord
[1:17:49] that's right praise God I love it I love
[1:17:53] it on the surface I love it in in the
[1:17:55] depths I love it in the Mysteries I love
[1:17:57] the part I understand I love the part I
[1:17:58] don't understand I love realizing I
[1:18:00] thought I understood and still didn't
[1:18:02] understand when somebody else I like
[1:18:04] that
[1:18:04] too I want God to be unsearchable I want
[1:18:08] it to be the unsearchable riches of
[1:18:10] Christ I don't want to come to the end
[1:18:12] of Revelation I don't want to bump into
[1:18:14] it and say well that's it that's all
[1:18:15] we're going to get God's not going to
[1:18:16] reveal himself anymore I want a god
[1:18:19] whose resources never run out I want a
[1:18:21] god who's beyond my understanding I want
[1:18:23] a God that I can't boil down and put in
[1:18:26] my bottle and control in any way I want
[1:18:28] a God that's bigger than anything I've
[1:18:30] ever comprehended far beyond my
[1:18:32] understanding I want a God that wants to
[1:18:34] be searched and found and wants to
[1:18:36] unveil himself to his children I want a
[1:18:38] god who's new every day I want a god
[1:18:40] who's constantly revealing himself to me
[1:18:43] I want him deep I want him wide I want
[1:18:45] him shallow I want him on the surface I
[1:18:47] want him in the depths I want him in the
[1:18:48] cracks I want him in the crevices I want
[1:18:50] him in plain sight I want him
[1:18:52] everywhere that's what this Revel is
[1:18:55] it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:18:58] Christ and what is Jesus Christ the word
[1:19:01] what is the word the very thought of God
[1:19:04] being expressed he is the anointed word
[1:19:06] for our day which is fullness not
[1:19:10] partiality amen we could preach this for
[1:19:14] 300 years and we're never going to come
[1:19:16] to the end of the
[1:19:18] message cuz it unlocked the mystery of
[1:19:21] God it finished the mystery of God and
[1:19:23] unlocked the the revelation of Jesus
[1:19:27] Christ
[1:19:30] amen and brother Brenham comes along and
[1:19:32] he starts preaching
[1:19:34] things that blow the mind of the
[1:19:38] ecclesiastical
[1:19:39] world what brother brandham did was the
[1:19:41] same thing Paul
[1:19:45] did
[1:19:48] amen he says in Christ is the mystery of
[1:19:51] God
[1:19:52] revealed now God had a
[1:19:55] purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's
[1:19:58] what I want to speak on to the church
[1:20:00] this morning the hidden Mystery of God
[1:20:02] that he had in his mind before the world
[1:20:03] ever began and how that it's unfolded
[1:20:06] itself right down to this present hour
[1:20:08] that we're living see when you will
[1:20:11] understand clearly then you see on I
[1:20:13] believe what is being
[1:20:15] done God's great mystery of how it's a
[1:20:18] secret he kept it a secret nobody know
[1:20:21] nothing about it
[1:20:25] even the angels didn't understand it he
[1:20:28] didn't reveal it that's the reason under
[1:20:31] our seventh mystery when the seventh
[1:20:33] seal was open there was silence Jesus
[1:20:35] when he was on Earth they wanted to know
[1:20:37] when he would come he said it's not even
[1:20:39] the son of man himself don't know when
[1:20:40] it's going to happen see God has this
[1:20:43] all to himself it's a secret what's a
[1:20:46] secret a
[1:20:48] mystery and that's the reason there was
[1:20:50] silence in heaven for the space of half
[1:20:52] an hour what's that that's revelation 81
[1:20:55] the opening of the seventh seal which
[1:20:57] brother Branham connected to Revelation
[1:20:59] 101:7 and made them the same
[1:21:03] events okay therefore the entire
[1:21:07] Bible oh my
[1:21:10] yeah let me pick up this sentence again
[1:21:12] and then I'll get to this and that's the
[1:21:15] reason there was silence in heaven for
[1:21:16] the space of half an hour and even and
[1:21:19] listen and seven Thunders uttered their
[1:21:21] voices
[1:21:25] there was silence in heaven and seven
[1:21:27] Thunders uttered their
[1:21:30] voices now listen what he says next and
[1:21:33] John was forent to write it see the
[1:21:36] coming of the
[1:21:38] lord it's a mystery it's a secret that
[1:21:43] he wants to make plain to his
[1:21:48] children see when brother Brenham comes
[1:21:50] to Christ's mystery of God revealed he
[1:21:52] preaches this in July 28th in 1963
[1:21:55] but he preaches the seals in March of
[1:21:57] 1963 and when he comes to the seventh
[1:21:59] seal when brother B comes to the seventh
[1:22:01] seal he spends a lot of time reviewing
[1:22:03] the previous seals he goes into to the
[1:22:05] six seal quite a bit and reviews it and
[1:22:07] talks about Revelation chapter 7 and he
[1:22:10] and he's doing like a lot of review and
[1:22:12] he's looking back and and if if you're
[1:22:15] like me you I've given you my testimony
[1:22:17] on that before you're like me you're
[1:22:18] anticipating the seven seal now right
[1:22:20] because we got the first six we know
[1:22:23] what a white horse rider is now I got
[1:22:24] that that I know that that's Antichrist
[1:22:26] spirit and then I know what Beast went
[1:22:28] out to anoint it and I know Souls on the
[1:22:30] Altar and now tribulation we know all
[1:22:32] that and then he comes to the seventh
[1:22:33] seal and he's really reviewing the Sixth
[1:22:36] Seal and he's going into Revelation
[1:22:37] chapter 7 these two groups of people and
[1:22:40] the interum and now he's coming up to
[1:22:42] the seventh seal and he gets ready to
[1:22:44] start explaining the seventh seal and he
[1:22:45] says a sentence or
[1:22:48] two and he says I feel to stop right
[1:22:51] there
[1:22:54] I feel a stop right there why it's a
[1:22:59] mystery he was told that he can't
[1:23:02] explain
[1:23:06] it he explained the first
[1:23:09] two and he got in trouble with the angel
[1:23:12] but he was told not to explain this
[1:23:14] third one so so he can't tell you what
[1:23:20] it
[1:23:21] is he can't explain it to you
[1:23:25] so when he says I feel to stop go no
[1:23:27] further right here in my notes I wrote
[1:23:29] stop go no further then he starts to say
[1:23:31] but remember the vision I told you many
[1:23:33] years ago remember the baby you remember
[1:23:35] the tent and he said this will be your
[1:23:37] third pool and the other day in Sabino
[1:23:39] Canyon and that sword struck my hand and
[1:23:41] that voice said this is your third
[1:23:44] pole what's he doing at first the first
[1:23:47] time I listened to this I'm like what is
[1:23:49] he talking about just tell me what the
[1:23:50] seven seal
[1:23:52] is would you just tell me just like you
[1:23:55] said White Horse is this and it means
[1:23:57] that why didn't you do this with the
[1:23:58] seven seal and so we're going through
[1:23:59] this and what he's doing is he's told by
[1:24:02] the angel don't explain it so what's he
[1:24:04] doing he's coming just like Jesus and
[1:24:06] he's showing by Parables remember the
[1:24:09] vision I told I feel to stop say no more
[1:24:12] remember the vision that I told you
[1:24:14] what's he doing he's telling you what
[1:24:16] the seven seal is without telling you
[1:24:18] what the seven seal
[1:24:21] is amen why because this is not for
[1:24:24] carnal impersonations this is not for
[1:24:26] anybody to pick up this is only for the
[1:24:28] elect amen and he goes through and he
[1:24:30] starts talking in Parables and he starts
[1:24:31] tying Parables and dreams and Visions
[1:24:34] together and he explains a few things
[1:24:36] amen then he stops then he comes a few
[1:24:38] months later and he comes and preaches
[1:24:40] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:24:42] and in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:24:43] revealed to my opinion based off what
[1:24:45] he's saying he starts to bring the
[1:24:47] revelation of the seventh seal because
[1:24:51] he says it's silence for half an hour
[1:24:53] and seven Thunders uttered their voice
[1:24:55] and John was forbidden to write it see
[1:24:57] no one knows what it is see the coming
[1:24:59] of the Lord now he's starting to tie it
[1:25:01] all together and show us what the
[1:25:03] opening of The Seven seal really is
[1:25:07] amen he says and that's one thing he
[1:25:11] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[1:25:14] and when he will come it's a good thing
[1:25:17] he doesn't
[1:25:19] know oh there's so many things I want to
[1:25:22] say
[1:25:26] brother B standing here getting ready to
[1:25:29] preach Christ is the mystery of God
[1:25:31] revealed and what is the opening of the
[1:25:32] seventh seal the mystery of God shall be
[1:25:36] revealed in the days of the voice of the
[1:25:39] seventh angel when he begins the sound
[1:25:40] the mystery of God shall be revealed the
[1:25:44] opening of the seventh seal and here he
[1:25:46] comes with a title that says Christ is
[1:25:50] the mystery of God
[1:25:52] revealed it's Christ
[1:25:55] it's the coming of Christ it's the
[1:25:57] coming of the Lord and it is the mystery
[1:26:00] of God
[1:26:03] revealed and then he tells us that it's
[1:26:06] the coming of the Lord and he says
[1:26:07] that's one thing he hasn't revealed
[1:26:09] yet my I love God yes you read that and
[1:26:14] say that's one thing he hasn't revealed
[1:26:15] yet of how he will come and when he will
[1:26:17] come it's a good thing he doesn't nope
[1:26:20] you say well Seven Seals not revealed he
[1:26:22] just said he hasn't revealed it yet that
[1:26:25] amen then you go to the next paragraph
[1:26:27] he has showed it or revealed it in every
[1:26:30] type that's in the Bible therefore the
[1:26:32] entire Bible is the revelation of God's
[1:26:35] mystery in Christ which is the seventh
[1:26:38] seal because Christ is the mystery of
[1:26:41] God revealed amen amen so now he says he
[1:26:46] has showed it or revealed in every type
[1:26:48] that's in the Bible therefore the entire
[1:26:50] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[1:26:52] in Christ H the ENT entire Bible is an
[1:26:55] expression of one goal that God had one
[1:26:57] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:26:59] entire Bible and all the acts of the
[1:27:01] Believers in the Bible has been in Tye
[1:27:03] and expressing what God's Great goal is
[1:27:05] and now in the last day he has revealed
[1:27:08] it and shows it and God said well you'll
[1:27:11] see it right here this morning yes wait
[1:27:14] a second he hasn't revealed it yet it's
[1:27:17] a good thing he doesn't know but you'll
[1:27:19] see it right here this
[1:27:22] morning it's not revealed How will I see
[1:27:25] it because he's not going to explain it
[1:27:27] he's just going to preach it and God's
[1:27:29] going to bring the
[1:27:31] Revelation
[1:27:34] amen oh and with God's help well I I
[1:27:39] love that and with God's
[1:27:42] help you'll see it right here this
[1:27:44] morning what the Lord has had in his
[1:27:47] mind all along and has expressed
[1:27:50] it he says Christ's mystery God revealed
[1:27:53] for the text I want to take here this
[1:27:55] for a text basing it upon the entire
[1:27:58] Bible but I want us to title this Christ
[1:28:01] is the mystery of God revealed Christ
[1:28:05] being the mystery of God
[1:28:09] revealed don't think of that title and
[1:28:13] put it far
[1:28:15] away amen because Christ is the anointed
[1:28:19] word and remember Abraham's seed was
[1:28:22] Christ and by by faith you're what
[1:28:25] Abraham's seed amen so that makes you
[1:28:28] part of Christ because if he was the
[1:28:30] word she has to be the word also and he
[1:28:33] is the fullness of the word and she has
[1:28:35] part in that so Christ the the the
[1:28:39] manifested anointed word is the mystery
[1:28:42] of God revealed and you and I have a
[1:28:45] part in that
[1:28:48] Revelation amen when he comes the souls
[1:28:51] that are in prison now just want to read
[1:28:53] a couple more so but one
[1:28:56] day he rose from there and came forth
[1:28:59] where there was a book at where was the
[1:29:01] book at it was still in the abstract
[1:29:02] owner God Almighty and John looked
[1:29:05] around and wept because there was no one
[1:29:07] no man even worthy to look on the book
[1:29:08] and especially open the seals to reveal
[1:29:11] what the hidden Mystery was the
[1:29:13] Mysteries was in the Seven Seals when
[1:29:15] those Seven Seals was opened that opened
[1:29:17] up the entire
[1:29:20] Bible the Seven Seals it was sealed with
[1:29:22] seven Mysteries and in those Seven Seals
[1:29:25] held the entire mystery of it and it was
[1:29:27] the book of redemption New
[1:29:30] Testament praise God this is the the
[1:29:33] next quote I want to read this day this
[1:29:35] scripture is fulfilled this is from
[1:29:37] February of 1965 he said the Seven Seals
[1:29:41] of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire
[1:29:43] Bible will be opened and fulfill
[1:29:46] Revelation 10 that in the seven seventh
[1:29:49] Angel's message these things should come
[1:29:51] to
[1:29:52] pass this day this scripture is
[1:29:55] fulfilled before your eyes this day this
[1:29:59] scripture is fulfilled praise be to God
[1:30:02] this was 1965 and he's telling us amen
[1:30:05] the Seven Seals of the hidden Mystery
[1:30:07] the entire Bible will be opened and
[1:30:09] fulfill Revelations 10 in the that in
[1:30:13] the seventh Angels message these things
[1:30:15] should come to pass this day this script
[1:30:17] he's letting you know Revelations 10 1-7
[1:30:21] is
[1:30:22] fulfilled what does it mean is this the
[1:30:24] sign of the Ender yes is this the end
[1:30:27] time yes is Gentile dispensations over
[1:30:30] yes amen is it the marking of the end of
[1:30:32] everything what is the seven seal It's
[1:30:33] The End Time seal when it goes forth it
[1:30:35] marks the end of everything but it goes
[1:30:37] out in Cycles one thing goes out and
[1:30:40] birth end of denominations and then
[1:30:42] another thing ends then another thing
[1:30:43] ends all the way till even time itself
[1:30:46] ends this is the end time seal the
[1:30:49] wrapping up conclusion finishing of
[1:30:51] everything that God's been wanting to do
[1:30:55] amen and it's been written in the White
[1:30:59] Rock on the inside of the pyramid that
[1:31:02] you can't add one word or take one word
[1:31:04] away you can't have you can't come up
[1:31:07] with something that's not in the Bible
[1:31:09] what you have to do is you have to get
[1:31:10] the Revelation and the Revelation must
[1:31:12] dovetail with the word of God why
[1:31:14] because it was laying in there in
[1:31:16] mystery form this is why brother bam
[1:31:18] says you've got to read between the
[1:31:19] lines why because there's a mystery
[1:31:22] laying the White Rock the unwritten
[1:31:25] portion amen where is it it's veiled
[1:31:27] it's veiled behind the the types and the
[1:31:30] shadows and the characters of The Bible
[1:31:32] they've all been revealing it but in
[1:31:34] time but now in the end time he's taken
[1:31:36] the veil away so that we can go back and
[1:31:38] we can read the book of Esther and say
[1:31:40] mama that's me we can read Ruth and say
[1:31:43] mama that's me we can read through all
[1:31:45] these these books of the Bible and say
[1:31:47] my I can't believe I've missed this all
[1:31:50] my life I can't believe we've been
[1:31:51] missing all of these great truths why he
[1:31:54] pulled back the seals to reveal the
[1:31:56] mystery that was contained in the
[1:31:59] Bible and that mystery brother baham
[1:32:03] comes and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:32:04] revealed and says it was revealed in a
[1:32:06] three-fold manner one purpose one goal
[1:32:10] one thing God wanted to accomplish this
[1:32:12] was the mystery veiled in the back part
[1:32:14] of his mind that nobody Through the
[1:32:16] Bible knew they took parts of in pieces
[1:32:18] and had bits of Revelation but nobody
[1:32:20] could compile the whole Revelation and
[1:32:22] put it together why it was sealed under
[1:32:25] those seven Thunders but in the end time
[1:32:27] God would have amen the seventh angel
[1:32:29] here on Earth in the leot dean Church
[1:32:32] age and he would get caught up into a
[1:32:34] constellation of angels come back for
[1:32:36] the revelation of the Seven Seals amen
[1:32:38] so that he could take the veil off of
[1:32:39] the word so he could come then later and
[1:32:41] preach Christ as the mystery of God
[1:32:44] revealed so that we would
[1:32:47] see it's
[1:32:50] me Colossians 1
[1:32:54] 2527 that's me the great mystery that he
[1:32:58] had in his mind is that he was going to
[1:33:00] reveal himself through people that's
[1:33:02] right yes sir that he was going to come
[1:33:05] and reveal himself in what the Lamb's
[1:33:08] Book of
[1:33:11] Life what is it people yes this Bible is
[1:33:16] the record of human beings from the
[1:33:18] beginning to the end every story is
[1:33:21] about people all the characters are
[1:33:23] people all the prophets are people it's
[1:33:26] people from beginning to
[1:33:28] end it's the book of life it's the
[1:33:31] family of God it's the record of Christ
[1:33:35] and guess what I found my
[1:33:38] identity in this book not more confusion
[1:33:43] not am I could I be I might be I hope I
[1:33:46] am but at the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:33:48] All the mystery and scare has been taken
[1:33:50] away I am part of this revelation
[1:33:55] yes brother
[1:33:57] B he comes and
[1:34:00] he he takes things that we took for
[1:34:06] granted and he comes and he he takes the
[1:34:10] gospel and he preaches the mystery of
[1:34:12] the
[1:34:14] Gospel he comes and he shows us so many
[1:34:20] things that I I I don't have time to get
[1:34:22] into them all neither do I I I even
[1:34:24] prepare to get into many of them but he
[1:34:27] starts teaching things that we took for
[1:34:29] granted and like what salvation is and
[1:34:33] what the blood is for and what
[1:34:34] Redemption is and and what does it mean
[1:34:36] to be redeemed and and and you know we
[1:34:39] had an idea through the through the
[1:34:41] denominational world that being redeemed
[1:34:43] means that I was I was in a junk pile
[1:34:46] amen and he come to a junk pile and he
[1:34:48] come and pulled me out and he and he
[1:34:49] paid for me and he redeemed me but
[1:34:51] brother brandham comes at at the at the
[1:34:53] revelation of God's mystery and he comes
[1:34:55] and he takes us deeper because he
[1:34:57] preaches the mystery behind the gospel
[1:34:59] and he says you can't redeem what wasn't
[1:35:01] yours to begin with the reason that
[1:35:03] we're redeemed is because we were with
[1:35:05] God before the foundation of the world
[1:35:07] as an attribute of God and now we're
[1:35:10] redeemable because we were with him
[1:35:12] before it's not God feeling sorry for
[1:35:15] certain individuals and you're a poor
[1:35:17] one and and if you'll just be nice and
[1:35:19] obey me and believe in me I will I will
[1:35:21] redeem you that's not what Redemption is
[1:35:24] Redemption is the little lost lamb that
[1:35:26] was with the shepherd before has
[1:35:28] separated from the flock and in the
[1:35:30] darkness of the world and the Shepherds
[1:35:32] coming down to find the lamb to what
[1:35:34] restore the lamb back to the shepherd to
[1:35:37] redeem it back and now Calvary was not
[1:35:39] about God feeling sorry for a bunch of
[1:35:42] people and hoping that somebody would
[1:35:44] accept his pardoning grace amen there's
[1:35:46] going to be a group amen that will get a
[1:35:48] pardon because of what they did with the
[1:35:50] word they had but that's not Calvary
[1:35:52] came for Redemption Calvary came for the
[1:35:55] elect seed he came down and paid the
[1:35:58] price for the Earth because he had
[1:36:00] himself swn into the Earth in a lost
[1:36:03] condition so he came himself to pay the
[1:36:05] price of blood for Redemption brother
[1:36:08] brandham took Redemption and took it to
[1:36:10] the depths of God and took it back to
[1:36:13] the mind of God Amen now there's no more
[1:36:17] uh you know there's no more you know
[1:36:19] brother B even talked about don't even
[1:36:21] like those prayers where he say don't
[1:36:23] you want to see Grandma someday and
[1:36:24] don't you want to do this and and won't
[1:36:26] you accept poor Jesus died for you won't
[1:36:29] you accept what he did for you my Jesus
[1:36:32] died amen for Redemption to redeem back
[1:36:35] amen the portion of God that God had
[1:36:37] portion redem brother B says only the
[1:36:40] elect is considered in
[1:36:42] Redemption only the elect is considered
[1:36:45] in Redemption and all of a sudden are
[1:36:47] the Armenian Believers their minds just
[1:36:49] go po amen because they cannot
[1:36:51] understand why because he knows the
[1:36:53] mystery of God he's been behind the veil
[1:36:56] amen the mystery's taken off the book
[1:36:58] and he now understands there's been one
[1:37:00] goal one God wanted to achieve and he's
[1:37:02] done it in a three-fold manner and that
[1:37:04] is to get preeminence in a man he did
[1:37:06] that in Jesus to get preeminence in a
[1:37:08] people he's doing that now in you and I
[1:37:12] to restore him back to Eden so God can
[1:37:15] manifest
[1:37:18] himself brother takes all these
[1:37:20] doctrines
[1:37:23] takes these doctrines and he
[1:37:26] begins to preach the mystery of the
[1:37:30] gospel and people can't take it they
[1:37:35] can't take it because brother R said
[1:37:38] even some ministers will
[1:37:40] misunderstand because they've been
[1:37:42] taught to believe scripture in a certain
[1:37:44] way right
[1:37:46] amen same thing reason that they didn't
[1:37:48] believe the Apostle Paul is the same
[1:37:51] reason they didn't believe brother
[1:37:52] Brandon yeah
[1:37:54] right because it wasn't intellectually
[1:37:58] obvious they had been studying the Bible
[1:38:00] and reading the verses and reading the
[1:38:02] scriptures and they had an understanding
[1:38:05] but brother Brenham comes because his
[1:38:07] understanding by the opening of the
[1:38:08] seals is so much greater than the
[1:38:10] understanding they had previously amen
[1:38:12] now the mystery is peeled back now we
[1:38:14] know why Christ came why we know how to
[1:38:17] what about why it had to be a virgin
[1:38:19] birth yeah why it had to be a blood
[1:38:21] atonement amen and all goes back to the
[1:38:24] serpent seat in the fall in the garden
[1:38:26] that's right amen all of these things
[1:38:28] what is it it's the mystery of the
[1:38:31] gospel and that's what's been handed to
[1:38:34] us the mystery of the
[1:38:39] Gospel there's so many things I would
[1:38:41] love to take those things one by one
[1:38:43] those doctrines and to take what we
[1:38:45] commonly understood and then what
[1:38:46] brother bham does with it it's
[1:38:48] absolutely mesmerizing amen what he does
[1:38:51] with justification blood atonement
[1:38:54] salvation predestination adoption amen
[1:38:58] all of these things they go so deep
[1:39:00] friends it reveals the very Mind Of God
[1:39:04] Amen but I want to finish with just a
[1:39:06] few quotes out of the message
[1:39:09] Paradox brother Bram
[1:39:12] says he said so there was
[1:39:15] Joshua representing Grace was right
[1:39:18] along with law but could not be enforced
[1:39:20] as long as law was in the proper place
[1:39:23] and so has the church World in this last
[1:39:25] day is coming along it's played its part
[1:39:28] but there's coming a time where it must
[1:39:30] cease it must do it there's got to be an
[1:39:33] Ephesians also of this journey just as
[1:39:36] there was of other Journeys there's
[1:39:38] there has to come an Ephesians and
[1:39:40] Ephesus an Ephesians of this journey and
[1:39:43] brother Bram said that it was really uh
[1:39:46] uh amazing to me I've been looking at
[1:39:48] this and meditating on it for a while
[1:39:50] Amen brother B preached a message called
[1:39:52] Joshua uh Joshua types
[1:39:55] Ephesians and Joshua is a book of
[1:39:59] placing it's a book of coming out an
[1:40:02] exodus and coming to a promised land and
[1:40:05] being placed in that
[1:40:06] land and Joshua was the agent that God
[1:40:10] would use and he would bring them across
[1:40:12] Jordan in a miraculous way after a a a a
[1:40:15] a journey amen through the Wilderness
[1:40:17] Journey where they saw failure and they
[1:40:19] saw mistake and they saw all kinds of
[1:40:20] things amen now they're coming across
[1:40:22] Jordan into a place of separation and
[1:40:24] now they're coming into the promised
[1:40:26] land and the entering here is pure
[1:40:29] grace pure grace they didn't earn it
[1:40:32] they didn't work for it they didn't pay
[1:40:33] for it this is God's land and God said
[1:40:35] I'm giving you this land it's absolute
[1:40:38] election and absolute Grace it's
[1:40:42] predestination election and Grace they
[1:40:44] had nothing to do with it Abraham didn't
[1:40:46] pay money for God says I'm giving you
[1:40:49] this land amen then they got into all
[1:40:51] kinds of chaos and and they had all
[1:40:52] kinds of issues happen and they find
[1:40:54] themselves in slavery down in Egypt and
[1:40:56] they're in Egypt for 400 years and
[1:40:58] afterwards God raises up Moses to come
[1:41:01] and bring them out this is all election
[1:41:03] this is all Grace this is all Mercy amen
[1:41:07] and they come across by pure grace and
[1:41:10] election he says I'm giving you this
[1:41:13] land it's yours go and possess it you
[1:41:18] get to go here this tribe goes here this
[1:41:20] tribe here this family here what's
[1:41:21] Joshua doing he's placing the church
[1:41:25] you're here and you're here you're here
[1:41:27] you're here it it it's a placing it's an
[1:41:29] adoption they're coming into the land
[1:41:32] and and it's all by
[1:41:35] Grace Moses was
[1:41:37] law but Joshua brother B said was Grace
[1:41:41] he represented the grace of God why
[1:41:43] because it's
[1:41:44] placing now he says Joshua uh types or
[1:41:48] Parallels Ephesians so now he says
[1:41:51] there's got to be an Ephesians
[1:41:54] at the end of The Journey there's got to
[1:41:55] be in Ephesians there's another quote
[1:41:58] here in Paradox where he says but we're
[1:42:01] promised according to Revelation 10 and
[1:42:03] according to Malachi 4 and St Luke 22:17
[1:42:06] and so forth there has got to come an
[1:42:09] Ephesians to this there is promised it
[1:42:12] friends so what does he called the
[1:42:14] Ephesians Revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke
[1:42:19] 22:17 what is it it's the coming of the
[1:42:21] message yeah it's the coming of the of
[1:42:24] the secret revealed the mysteries of the
[1:42:26] seven Thunders the Seven Seals being
[1:42:28] opened the great mystery of God now has
[1:42:31] to come what to be our
[1:42:33] Ephesians what is our Ephesians I chose
[1:42:37] you you didn't choose me remember how
[1:42:39] Ephesians chapter 1 starts we've been
[1:42:41] reading it when we've been talking about
[1:42:43] the mystery of his will amen according
[1:42:45] to the good pleasure of his will he
[1:42:46] chose us in Christ before the foundation
[1:42:48] of the world Amen when he chose us
[1:42:50] before the foundation of the world what
[1:42:51] did we have to do with it nothing he did
[1:42:54] the choosing according to the good
[1:42:55] pleasure of his will this is our
[1:42:58] Ephesians coming at the end time at the
[1:43:00] opening of the seals we realize I didn't
[1:43:02] do anything the only thing I could have
[1:43:04] done was ruin this it's what he did
[1:43:06] before the foundation of the world when
[1:43:08] he chose me in Christ and chose me unto
[1:43:11] adoption he chose me for an Ephesians
[1:43:15] age right amen what was Ephesians
[1:43:17] Ephesians was the first church age this
[1:43:19] is where the Apostle Paul amen was
[1:43:21] bringing them out of judaa ISM and he
[1:43:23] was bringing the Gentiles out of
[1:43:25] heathenism and he was bringing them into
[1:43:27] the New Testament Church and Ephesians
[1:43:29] starts off with what Grace pure absolute
[1:43:33] Grace you are this by his choice you're
[1:43:37] chosen adoption by his choice you were
[1:43:39] chosen in Christ Jesus by his good
[1:43:40] pleasure you've been accepted in the
[1:43:42] Beloved because he wanted
[1:43:44] to that was Ephesians amen but they fell
[1:43:47] from their Ephesians just like Israel
[1:43:49] fell from their Crossing from their
[1:43:51] taking the land
[1:43:53] but he said there's got to come in
[1:43:54] Ephesians in the end time and it's going
[1:43:57] to take the opening of the word to bring
[1:44:00] us back to
[1:44:02] Ephesians here's I would like to read
[1:44:04] that again because I didn't finish the
[1:44:06] quote I got a little too
[1:44:07] excited so we're promised according to
[1:44:09] Revelation 10 according to Malachi 4 and
[1:44:11] St Luke 22:17 and so forth that there is
[1:44:15] got to come in Ephesians to this this is
[1:44:18] promised it friends there must come in
[1:44:20] Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries
[1:44:22] of the word of God must be
[1:44:24] unfolded what brings Ephesians the
[1:44:28] unfolding of the mystery of the Bible
[1:44:31] that brings us into our
[1:44:34] Ephesians and it's in the leoty and age
[1:44:36] that this takes place further down in
[1:44:39] Paradox he says now you cannot add
[1:44:40] nothing to the book or take anything
[1:44:42] from it Revelation 22:18 says who will
[1:44:46] Who willever will add one word or take
[1:44:47] one word is part will be taken from the
[1:44:49] book of life now we cannot add or take
[1:44:52] so therefore we know that Luther could
[1:44:54] not get to it Wesley and so forth the
[1:44:57] reformers knocked finny Calvin on down
[1:45:00] so forth they didn't get it all but what
[1:45:03] they had was the Gospel truth you
[1:45:06] believe that amen they couldn't get it
[1:45:08] all but what they had was the Gospel
[1:45:10] truth but what we have is the mystery of
[1:45:14] the Gospel amen they had the gospel
[1:45:17] truth all down Through the Ages but what
[1:45:18] we have is the mystery of the Gospel
[1:45:21] amen and now now in the last days we are
[1:45:25] given the understanding by the word that
[1:45:27] we are going to understand it because
[1:45:30] it'll come an Ephesians age to it and
[1:45:33] we're
[1:45:35] here what is the Ephesians age Paul the
[1:45:39] Apostle Paul placing the
[1:45:42] church what was Joshua Joshua placing
[1:45:46] the
[1:45:46] church what is the opening of the
[1:45:48] seventh seal supposed to do bring us to
[1:45:50] adoption place the church where is it
[1:45:53] placing us it's placing Us in the word
[1:45:56] amen this is you and this is your
[1:45:58] territory and this is who you are this
[1:46:00] is what you fulfill and this is the
[1:46:02] portion of
[1:46:03] scripture he's placing us Amen in the
[1:46:07] word an exodus out of denominations and
[1:46:11] church systems an exodus out of these
[1:46:14] things and being put back into the
[1:46:18] word that is our Ephesians
[1:46:23] now in Joshua this is this is why this
[1:46:25] is so
[1:46:26] critical in Joshua Joshua comes and by
[1:46:30] like I said pure grace and election he
[1:46:32] places them in the land and then after
[1:46:35] he places them in the land now he says
[1:46:37] now it's your job to possess this land
[1:46:40] amen it's your job to cultivate it Farm
[1:46:43] it raise crops worship God keep it clean
[1:46:45] keep it pure raise your children worship
[1:46:48] God come to the temple three times I
[1:46:50] mean now it it's it's pure Grace it's
[1:46:53] pure grace and election that brings you
[1:46:56] into the land but now it's your
[1:46:58] responsibility to possess the land and
[1:47:01] live in it according to God and Shine
[1:47:03] the Light and be the word of God made
[1:47:07] flesh in the
[1:47:08] land and now according to Malachi 4 and
[1:47:12] Revelation 10:7 there's to be an
[1:47:14] Ephesians age again where we're taken
[1:47:16] out in a Third Exodus and brought back
[1:47:19] to a placing of the church and where is
[1:47:21] he placing the bride he's placing us in
[1:47:24] Christ the revealed
[1:47:26] word and then what does he
[1:47:29] say now live it now manifest it now
[1:47:34] possess the word now possess it and stay
[1:47:37] with it and manifest it and keep the
[1:47:40] keep keep the wild beast away and
[1:47:42] cultivate it and grow it and amen stay
[1:47:44] in the land and Shine the Light and be
[1:47:47] the nation set on a hill be the word of
[1:47:50] God made flesh amen there's coming a Fe
[1:47:52] iians once again
[1:47:54] friends and what did he do first he
[1:47:57] opened the
[1:47:58] seals why was that so important yes
[1:48:01] because if we're still wondering what
[1:48:03] the plan of God is and who we are and if
[1:48:05] I'm included and what's going to happen
[1:48:07] and and who's in and who's out and which
[1:48:09] one's right we never go and possess the
[1:48:12] land so first he had to come and clean
[1:48:15] up all the
[1:48:18] misunderstanding so that we could
[1:48:19] properly know who we are and what God
[1:48:21] wants to do then could place Us in the
[1:48:23] word and then leave us by the spirit of
[1:48:29] God to possess the land yes oh God help
[1:48:35] us to possess this land help us to have
[1:48:38] eyes open Hey listen it's not laws it's
[1:48:41] not dos and don't it's not a have to
[1:48:43] amen when God said this is your land
[1:48:45] they were so excited to March into that
[1:48:46] land they were so excited to set up a
[1:48:48] home they were so excited to be
[1:48:50] cultivating and growing and exploring
[1:48:52] amen and when this word was restored he
[1:48:54] said live the word amen it wasn't like
[1:48:56] he was saying if you don't I'll cut you
[1:48:58] off he already took care of that for us
[1:49:03] amen he's not going he's not going to
[1:49:06] lose
[1:49:08] one but this is the age we're not going
[1:49:11] to fall like first Ephesians fell she's
[1:49:14] predestinated not to the veil's been
[1:49:17] taken so she can step back
[1:49:20] in to her position
[1:49:23] and finish what the first church didn't
[1:49:25] finish to live this word to manifest it
[1:49:29] to display Jesus Christ in a many
[1:49:32] membered body that's what we're here for
[1:49:36] and that's what the seals unveiled to
[1:49:38] you and I amen our position our portion
[1:49:42] and our placing and our
[1:49:45] responsibility praise God let's all
[1:49:48] stand
[1:49:56] amen musicians if you'll come brother
[1:50:00] Ben if you'll
[1:50:03] come friends there's a
[1:50:06] gospel give your heart to the
[1:50:09] Lord surrender to his word come to
[1:50:13] church live the word that there's a
[1:50:17] gospel but the power comes in the
[1:50:19] mystery of the Gospel amen who we are
[1:50:23] why why Redemption by Blood why election
[1:50:28] why predestination why a prophet why the
[1:50:30] opening of the word
[1:50:32] why the real power to live comes in the
[1:50:36] unveiling of the Seven Seals taking away
[1:50:39] the mystery of who the bride really is
[1:50:42] and bringing us into the picture I say
[1:50:45] oh thank God all of those children of
[1:50:48] Israel who crossed that Jordan and took
[1:50:50] their land they knew it wasn't for

[1:51:46] time God there was men your children
[1:51:50] your elect seed that come up in every
[1:51:52] generation and every
[1:51:54] dispensation and God it each one was so
[1:51:57] thrilled with the revelation of the word
[1:51:59] for their hour they were thrilled with
[1:52:02] the teaching of true justif
[1:52:04] justification they were thrilled with
[1:52:06] sanctification they were thrilled with
[1:52:08] the restoration of the gifts and it was
