========================================

i need you [Music] somehow [Music] praise the lord god bless you this evening it's good to see you out and i'm so glad it's not snowing first wednesday and a couple of them that it's not snowing praise god so if we go out and have to chip ice off of our windows something is up amen but praise god we're glad to be here and thank god for the time we have we're going to finish the message shalom lord willing tonight and i've been enjoying it very much i always enjoy this we've done this about once a year and sometimes more but it really i really thoroughly enjoy doing this together as a body amen let's uh take and take our bibles and open to isaiah 60 we'll read a couple scriptures and let you be seated we're going to read again the opening scriptures that brother branham opens with here when he starts preaching the message shalom so we can be reminded of what he he starts it's very important i believe it's very important the opening scriptures brother branham uses i always told you before i look at the title i look at where the message is placed in the sequence of events what is he trying to tell us and the opening scriptures he opens with because brother branham's not just picking a scripture that kind of has something to do with this title and then moving on and preaching nothing about it he's actually opening with that scripture because this is what he's preaching on so i'd like to keep that fresh in our minds so let's start off with isaiah 60 verse 1. arise shine for thy lightest come i think i could preach every time i read that line because that's the commandment arise shine he's saying this is the rising of the sun but where is the rising of the sun upon thee so he's he's telling you to arise and shine wake up church come out of dark layer to see you arise out of denominationalism arise out of the deadness of the church ages arise and shine he's commanding us to arise and shine it's not a suggestion it's not a cute phrase it's a commandment it's time now bride to arise and shine arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee so where are you going to see the glory of the lord today upon thee amen all right let's turn back the other scripture was psalm 62. this is the other scripture that brother branham opened this sermon with psalm 62 and verse 1. psalms chapter 62 and verse 1 truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he alone is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved this is so awesome because we learned before what is a rock in the scripture a rock is a revelation of god it's a rock when god's revealed to you this is what he tells us so the revelation of god is the revelation of the hour and is salvation he alone is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will you imagine mischief against a man you shall be slain all of you as a about a bowing wall shall you be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly selah my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation in my glory the rock of my strength in my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us sila let's just pray dear lord jesus we thank you god for your word and how it means so much to us lord and we pray that you would further reveal even these scriptures to us lord god as we listen to this tape i pray you'd make it fresh manna for us today as we review these things and discuss them i pray that you would anoint the discussion lord you knowing everything we would say and let everything we say be pleasing unto you we give you first place today in jesus name we pray amen you can all be seated let's take out our books i'm going to do just a quick review and then we'll go to our questions uh also i have a note here to remind everybody that this saturday night we spring forward we move our clocks so this is the tricky one see if anybody's late the next the the other one you get here really early to church that's good so you look spiritual but this one if you mess it up you don't look spiritual so we'll see how many get that one all right if we look here at shalom let's just open to page six i just want to do a quick review of the last few things we've been over not everything we've discussed but just remind ourselves of a couple things and let's look at on page seven i'm sorry not six page seven paragraph 32 this is what i just got done saying referring to the scripture now if you notice in the scripture reading there in the psalms it kept saying god is my rock do you know what a rock represents in the bible a rock in the bible here represents the revelation of god he is my rock and my salvation amen the revelation of god see god is my revelation he is see the revelation of the word is the rock so skip down to paragraph 37 and david's speaking here god is our rock god is our rock when god has been revealed to us that becomes a rock see god is our rock so i say that in saying this we can't just say the word is my rock because the word with no revelation can't be your rock and you can't say god is my rock amen in a denominational way of saying god is my rock or the word is my rock because with no revelation it's not a rock it becomes a rock a defense salvation protection it becomes all of those things when it's a revelation from god so it's very important that we understand we there's terminology that have been tossed around in bible terminology that actually has no meaning without the revelation of the hour and the revelation of the hour the revelation of jesus christ today gives meaning it's terminology that's why there's so much biblical terminology that gets tossed about in denominational realms but it never has power to transform it never has power to bring a change and it never has power to overcome because it's just terminology with no revelation because the rock is not terminology the rock is revelation so super important all right let's look back at the top of page six and i just like to read this because it means so much to me and brother branham is speaking here of this new year's message in uh paragraph 26 that now today as we face new years i want to think of not like the past but i want to look to the future so brother branham is here in 1964 preaching the first message in 1964 and he doesn't want to look to the past but if you just looked just a few months in the previous year that was a good past but he's not willing to camp down on what god did because he's looking for what god will do and so we want to have the same mindset tonight i don't ever want to camp down on what god did but i want to be looking to what god's going to do what he's doing and what he's going to do but i want to look to the future see as paul said forgetting those things that are in the past i press towards the mark see of the high calling and as it's expressed like looking back through the mirror of a car we are looking we are looking what we have passed when we're looking in the rearview mirror now we're not trying to place the message today as looking through a rear view mirror it would take too long see the things that the lord has did and you're all acquainted with the great things that our lord has been doing is some of the mightiest things that i've ever seen in my life just passing in the last few months but now but now we are thankful for what has been but now we're looking forward we're looking now we're looking where we're headed for and into this 1964. praise god if the prophet could do that after all he experienced in 1963 i think we can do that now amen all right let's look over at paragraph 96 on page 19. we want to look at light light to the church for just the morning in contrast to darkness because we know when brother ben was telling us last time that the church has gone into total darkness and it was displayed by the blackout of the moon that had hit the newspapers just before the pope left to go to jerusalem and there was a complete blackout of the moon and so he's talking about darkness because the church has gone into complete darkness and now he's talking about light in paragraph 96 he says what is light the vindicated spoken word of god outside of that there's no light can we let that be true the vindicated spoken word of god outside of that there there's no light see you can't lighten the earth with flashlights it takes god's word that's made manifest the sun he amen praise be to god that's our light now i want to look at paragraph 112 the next page over here on page 21. and i want to look at the morning star for just a minute we talked about this last time when we see darkness settling darkness just before day we know that the morning star is hanging yonder to introduce the coming sun it's that's when the morning star shines it's the going between it always darkest just a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkness before day is because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning shalom that's him among us his word being identified shalom so brother branham said the morning star is the going between going between night and day and the morning star is testifying that the sun is coming up or it's the forerunner like john the baptist was to jesus now brother branham was prophesied just as john the baptist before in his first coming your message will form a second coming so now it's also the morning star which is christ himself through the prophet's ministry being the uh announcing the rising of the sun and what we talked about before was what was amazing is what he four ran and the thing he four ran came together in one vessel because brother brennan was also the wave chief of the bride the wave chief of the wheat field that come to full maturity the 400 maturity so he four ran it and he displayed it as the wave sheath all in one vessel praise be to god let's look at paragraph 132 on page 23 john the baptist was the light of the hour he was the light before jesus was the light the prophet isaiah said oh the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make straightest paths amen let's skip down to the last paragraph 136. now what about the new year that we're facing we could have more to say on this in between from darkness to light to introducing the light coming between but now we want to get right straight to the new year now i say that to say this because just as just as brother branham in his forerunner part of his ministry he was that morning star that was christ amen appearing through the the prophet messenger the forerunner announcing that the sun would come up but then brother branham gets to the message and shalom and said it's the sun has come up he gets to the rising of the sun and says this is the rising of the sun he's showing you that there was the go between amen between the darkness of the church ages and the rising of the sun or the fullness of the word coming back and now it's back but then now that that sun is up moved into a bride amen jesus christ coming in the form of the bride and now the bride is a go-between light amen between death and life and now the bride and i'm just taking this in the type now now the bride is announcing the coming of the millennium now she's the forerunner of a new day and that new day will be the millennium and so this cycle just keeps repeating all the way down through praise god let's turn to paragraph 158. on page 26 down at the bottom this is the last thing that we read through last week just exactly like he showed us in the seven church ages what would come just exactly what he showed us what would come when he set that light up there in revelation or set that light up there in revelation to it to show the world now he said he set that light up there he's talking about the cloud the picture that they took in february 28th of 1963 he when he says he shut that light up there in revelation to it showing the world he's talking about that clown when he sent the seven angels to reveal the seven messenger that had been down through there and show the loose ends each angel coming each day and revealing the loose ends that luther left wesley left the pentecost left is all represented in there and in the very type and shadow of the great shalom jehovah yahweh see exactly throwed it in the skies and there's the mechanical eye taking a picture of it see thank the lord shalom peace don't be weary jesus is here i love that line jesus is here his great light has come to us and we're thankful for it is it the rising of the sun yes jesus is here this great light has come to us and we're thankful for him yes his word the great mystery here he is today manifesting himself doing the same as he did then just the same doing the very same amen praise the lord let's turn to the next page to page 28 and we're going to start at the bottom of paragraph 165. if you take your pen and paper out i've got a couple questions that we'll ask and we'll start with just four questions the first one is easy the scripture is god's blank this is a fill in the blank it's an easy one the scripture is god's blank number two how was brother branham's teaching on the church ages vindicated now there's more than one answer for this you could think in your mind now but he's going to talk about this in the message and we're talking about what he says here in the message how was brother branham's teaching on the church ages vindicated it's number two number three what did they kill jesus for this message will answer that what did they kill jesus for number three and number four what are the growing pains of his grace he explains that quite a bit here what are the growing pains of his grace number one was the scripture is god's blank number two how was brother branham's teaching on the church ages vindicated number three what did they kill jesus for and number four what are the growing pains of his grace so we're going to start here at the bottom of paragraph 165 with the last line and then we are going to go all the way to the end of the book the tape quality changes just at the last six minutes you shut off the main tape and they start another one so you'll hear that but we've got the words on the overhead we've got the our books so we'll be able to hang with it but you'll notice the tape quality changes but just hang with it it's only the last six minutes all right god bless you we can go ahead and bring that up brother franco you say brother brandon how do you get that well let me give some thought here just a minute do you know what a sympathy is i know you do it's a music that's a drama see they acted out now you little children so you'll understand you remember in his school i believe you have um what is that little russian sympathy sometimes they they act out on the drums you know it's called um isn't the little about the the little woodpecker you know a guy under the woods and they had the fluttering the beating on the drums and things and you hear it all as you go through the sympathy as they play it uh i forget the name of that peter then the wolf that's right peter and the wolf now that's a that's a russian sympathy see they don't they don't have little little figures flying around playing out but they play it on drums and then and make the drums and the sounds and things it plays it out it acts it so you understand what brother brown's trying to say now do you adults the scripture is god's sympathy yes hallelujah amen amen only composer knows what it really means and he reveals it to those who are listening who are interested in knowing what the drama is amen but you have to know about a sympathy first see it's not just something you see it's the the changing the junctions of the word uh of the music you throw sometimes it's going this way for a while a certain beat after all it changes all around amen what is it to you who wouldn't understand it or don't know nothing about not interested in it it's just a racket amen it's a fuss amen but to those who know about it they're watching they know it's coming amen hallelujah so we have these times of sympathies of the sympathy of god's word the whole drama changes amen were interested listen for that change you know what's getting close you hear the way the drums are beating hey man what's have to happen you know this is a change see it's gonna break out into a burst in a few minutes see you're watching parts you tell the way the drums are timing oh god if you can hear the drums of the finish now you can hear the echo of the music of the heavenly word is singing itself out it shall come to pass in the last days amen the sympathy of god's great drama that he's playing it changes in his sympathy at the junction the composer and those who are interested listen for the change that's what all this stuff is to us we're listening we're watching every time it appears something happens we see the time getting close we see it back not long ago when that church ages were being drawn out we were listening we see it was right with the word beat with the word angel while what happened very come himself amen amen and vindicated him we heard the word say that in the days of the seventh angel in the church age it just said the seventh angels message would be the last message and then what we find out over here in revelations 10 in the days of the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of god should be finished the seventh seal would be pulled back it should be there and all at once was happening a vision broke said go to tucson amen a great noise will take place at this time so you be thoroughly understanding and know that sin it'll just shake the earth nearly amen all of you know about it it's on tape months before it happened that happened amen there appeared in the skies shalom what is it it's a changing beats the sympathy then one time he said about the third pull [Music] i would come by this one way them annoying the heart and then the spoken word amen jesus said greater things than this will you do for i go to my father john 14 the works that i do shall you do also greater than this for i go unto my father just as i said a while ago when mary tried to identify him at joseph's son he corrected her amen his words cannot fail he said so god will fail but my words are not when we hear the sympathy beating change and fix the change it's a junction time we notice says he begin to defeat and we've seen the works said i do shall you do also and greater shall you do greater he promised it we've wondered how it could be but did you notice when he performed his first miracle he took water and turned it into wine is that right he took water which potentially someday might have been wine but it was water first and when he fed 5 000 what did he do he took something that had been like water he took a fish that once swam and was born from an egg and he broke it and another fish grow on to the creation that was the original creation he took bread that was once sweet and was a seed and become bread and he broke from this bread and the creation only multiplied but in the woods there was nothing there to make a squirrel let there be and there was without anything to break it from what is it the same jesus christ greater things than this will you do amen for i go to my father not take something that's been created break something from that multiply creation but absolutely create showing that he's the same jehovah that stood backers said let there be and there was his word was made manifest when he's made flesh on earth he took his original creation broke it back and multiplied it but now the last days when he comes down among us again the same light that moved down and said let there be light amen he just speaks the creation into existence amen greater than this will you do or i go to my father remember we're at these times in the world don't understand because it's a bunch of nonsense because they're not methodists the methodists don't understand it because it's if they ain't the bad the baptists don't understand it amen because it's not catholic the catholic don't understand it amen because it's not pentecostal to pentecost or don't understand it but those who wait upon the lord those who are looking not one man we have history of any observatory knowing that star that passed over but the wise men followed it for hundreds of miles for two years they watched it and followed it see what i mean to those who are listening to the sympathy remember the composer knows the end from the beginning he knows all about it that's the reason you gotta write it here correctly now you must begin with him you must begin if you want to hear a sympathy you begin with him like in the music at the sympathy you listen you know what it says it's going to be what the symphony is then you begin to listen to music and you know what it is so you know just about here's where certain certain things take place that's got to change not anybody else don't know about what they're just walking sit down it's just a bunch of nonsense rattling noise but the one who knows what it is it's beat out with the music jumped out for the notes it's it's trumpeted with the trumpets it's strung on the heart it's played with the violin it's uh it's uh beat on the bass it's sounded by the trumpets it's beat on the drums the whole thing together in rhythm and it makes the drama so you can close your eyes and live in it hallelujah amen close is mortalized to earthly sight and living the presence of jesus christ when you see his word being beat out in the great sympathy that we're living in now changing you must begin in the symphony the only thing you can do if you're in the symphony then you start you begin to get into the rhythm that's the way you do god amen you don't stand off and look at it amen you get into the rhythm of it how do you get in there you're born into it into the rhythm of the word when you become part of that word you have to become part of the dance to get out of the dance you have to become part of the ball game something you're interested in to get in the ball game you have to become part of the word an oh god sympathy sympathy is what it's playing you understand you're marching with the beat of the time you're watching part of works that i do shall you also greater than this shall you do these last days oh my the great changing of the time we'll get into the beat be to the word find his purpose the hour that we're living get into the rhythm of it how does how he does it if you get into the word you find out how he did it at the beginning amen then you know he's doing it all the time how did he send his message first what does he do he doesn't deal with organizations he never did so he doesn't do it now if you're listening to a rhythm of that counsel of churches you're in darkness but if you're listening to the rhythm of the word what did he kill jesus for you being a man make yourself god you got my message on the three types of believers now that one stood there and it was the make believers they followed along for a while making out like they believed one day jesus said to them say what will you think when the son of man which is from heaven um ascends back into heaven i come from heaven going back to heaven why the baltic multitude walked away and said this is a hard saying amen then there come the make believers that was walking with him the 70. when they got something hard they didn't see they didn't know the sympathy amen they didn't know the promise that this child was jehovah his name shall be called counselor prince of peace almighty god amen and when he said when i ascend up to heaven from where i come from well they said this is a hard thing who can argue that we know you're just a man we eat with you we sleep with you we're in the woods with you we're by the waters with you while you're merry a man and say the son of man that goes back up where he comes from what will you say this is a hard thing see they didn't know the beat they didn't know the rhythm of the sympathy of god's word that he was god manifested in the flesh for he was a vindicated word light of the hour they didn't get it he said this is a hard thing who can understand this and they turned away they didn't know the beat amen then we notice again there was judas the make-believer or the unbeliever that waited that he found a paul then he turned to the disciples said just a 12. and judas was one of them he said you want to go too then peter said who would we go to lord you're the composer amen you know what's going on amen you're the only one that has a word of life where could we turn to we couldn't go back to be a pharisee or sadducee or herodian or whatever it might be yeah you're the one that has the word of life we have no other place to go we've joined ourselves to this great concert we are in here we're listening and we're in the rhythm we believe that you are the son of god the manifested jehovah amen we're sure of this amen we don't know what these great trials and troubles and afflictions and things and you saying you're going to be offered up in all this other and on the third day all this stuff we don't understand that but we're in listen to god's sympathy we're a part of and we're waiting to see what takes place next and we're following close with you oh my that's what i want to do promise how does he begin just like he did at the beginning he never did send his message to our organization he never sent his group a message he sent one man in the days of noah it was noah in the days of moses it was moses this others thought one time that they said will you make yourself the only holy man in lunch god look down upon me amen moses when said lord i've done this what must it say separate yourself from them i'll take care of the rest of it i sent you it's my responsibility and he opened up the earth and swatted up cora in all the games always john and jesus couldn't be the same time jesus when john looked up and said now i must decrease he must increase he's a vindicated light so will this light move on until he'll find it full of vindication comes that's right that's right he is as he was at the beginning that's how you start how you start learning what god was what did he do when he was here on earth what type of life did he live did he agree was he a compromiser did he go to the organizations how did he identify himself search the scriptures you think in them you think you have eternal life and they're the ones that testify me that's the same thing today or any other time when you want light see what the scripture says for this hour all right where do you begin then if there's a sinner here you begin at the cross where you're wrecking yourself dead with him you've entered in then to the to the great drama you're listening then you're watching your sheet as you hold in your hand the the symphony you got a sheet in your hand that would tell you these things where the changes of the music begins to make it act out then you see what the act is when you see god's spirit fall upon people and do a certain thing you look back to see where it's at see if it's that that's the thing for today why they had to shoot in their hands when jesus came of the sympathy certainly they did i'm i saying that word right symphony sympathy i hope so so then i just happen to think of it symphony sentiment is that right all right now they had a sheet in their hands but what would they do they were trying to look back to a beat that had all a portion had already been played out amen that's what the churches do today they look back see what part luther played the luthers does they don't know the change of music amen they don't know what god's doing today when he does these things the lutheran the pinnacle oh we got it you got a sheet that played out 50 years ago certainly let's just keep this word in our hands and watch when the changes comes then we'll know what we're doing now have begin with him at the cross repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the music amen the direction his word the holy ghost that manifests the word then follow through with the rhythm of the word whatever the music beats for that hour beat with it amen many people ask them why hey somebody asked me why why once these things happen why why why did this happen to me why did i start and this happened i had this trouble here and this upset me here and i lost this year sometimes i've asked why why when i was just a young minister first started out said god take my wife right off from under me take my baby right from beneath me right beneath my heart why did you do that i didn't know i do now i just held my hand in his and kept trusting he knows every junction he knows the rhythm must when it must take place he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what kind of material he's going to use see the back side of the desert sometimes where god molds righteous men into sages and prophets that's where men are beat out men are beat out in the word when they got all kind of creed and stuff in them comes the word god beats it right out of him molds it right into this into the great sympathy with of his word see and then they see the word moving on god knows when the rhythm of it's got to change he knows how the rhythm goes i don't know how it goes but he knows he knows how it goes i don't i look out here and i say well it's just coming many are the afflictions of the righteous but god delivers him out of them all god has moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of his word in each age in the same rhythm making his word that's how god moved down through history from all the way from genesis to revelation he has moved through history with his word that's right with the rhythm of the power of the holy spirit vindicating his word to the elected amen he's never been able to touch the outside church amen it's only the elected look at that priest said this man is beelzebub he's a fortune teller why he he's reading their minds little do they know the word is sharper than a two-eighth sword a discerner of the thoughts that's in the heart and he was the word but this little prostitute stand at the whale that day to get a bucket of water she said i perceive that you're a prophet yes amen we know the messiah has come and we had prophets for hundreds of years but we know the messiah is coming and when he comes that's what he's going to be he said i'm he that was enough the rhythm behind he was looking for that change from a church denomination to a vindicated messiah yes to the messiah that moses spoke of the lord your god shall raise a prophet like unto me amen there he is the rhythm changed the vindicated seed recognized it amen and when the real word of god falls upon the vindicated upon the seed and they see that vindication of the word they recognize it they're looking at the word they know the junction they know the time they know the change they know the beat that's supposed to be in that hour hallelujah they know the beat they know the time they know how it's supposed to go only the elected knows it philip saw it he couldn't stand it any longer he knew that was messiah so he went to a fellow that had bible study together nathanael he said come see the command come see what we found we have found jesus of nazareth we found jesus of nazareth that's the prophet that moses spoke of to become we found him we found him he said how can it be i just where was he see he wasn't see he didn't know the rhythm yes exactly they've been studying but when he got there he told him introduced to him the word and when he got there jesus said behold in israelites the rhythm began to take hold amen the great drama was being played out on the platform or on the ground on that day maybe jesus stand up on the rock talking to the people and when philip come up but nathanael he looked over to him and said behold an israelite in whom there's no god he said rabbi when did you ever know me said before philip called you when you were under the tree i saw you oh my god he was part of it he said thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel no matter what the the world beats was and all their shin digs ahead of the of the denominations it wasn't that great sympathy of god amen he said that king of israel there you are a sith i know it why he was elected the elected seed knows it's always whoever age that's they know it say but brother branham what about my mother and dad what about my people what about my denomination what will they do they'll cast me out is it if you can't look ahead look up don't try to look ahead anyhow put your hand in his let him lead you look up don't look ahead you say why while others make fun of me about my long hair and me taking off shorts and about me leaving the church suffering for his name's sake is growing pains of his grace yes suffering for his word is growing pains of his grace yes sir just remember it's a grace of god's been given to you oh my like paul said hallelujah out of infirmity something has bothered him get the devil the bethany blow after blow and he can some of the lord three times to take it away from him he said i don't want this lord take it away from it and then one night the lord spoke to him said saul are paul my grace is sufficient there are glory in mind from america oh gloria i know you're the healer i have seen you heal the sick raise a deadly cast out devil open the eyes of the blind but if i've consolidated you and you tell me if your grace is sufficient then this devil that bothers me is is the growing pains of your grace then our glory and mind is why lest i get exalted above the abundance of the revelation see he said he had something the other disciples didn't have he saw him after his death burial resurrection ascension he saw him somebody said well i walked with him so did everybody on the street but hatred is dead buried rose and ascended up and returned back in the form of a pillar of fire he talked to paul that morning the rest of them had amen he said except i get exalted i'm going to build great big seminaries and everything else and great big something other unless i did get exalted above the abundance this revelation god let a messenger of the devil keep me beat down he said then when i'm weak i'm strong amen amen growing pains of grace amen will you stay on that a long time hour and 45 minutes has passed suffering his grace pain oh he may permit crossroads he may permit crossroads to tries to perfect us for his service he may permit that night church both here and on tape he may permit the crossroads for our service like he did daniel he gave daniel a little crossroads one day you know he's a great man down in babylon he didn't and let the king turn against him and throw him in the lion's den it only perfected him sure it is let the hebrew children go into the fiery furnace that was determined to stand for his word he may permit crosswords let them laugh at you for having long hair let him laugh at you for saying why you become a holy roller or whatever more it may they may let you laugh they may laugh at you for that that's all right that's a crossroads that's a little junction that's to prove something see the only thing that the crossroad did to the hebrew children that stood on the word it only loosed them from the bands they had around their feet and legs and sometimes it takes hard trials to break the bands of the world off of us sometimes god lets us have a little trial you know to see what we'll do to take you out of the world or in other words let's have a little trial and knock you out that organization and that idea that the methodist is the only one the baptist or the pentecostal that's that's the only group to god if you don't believe it like my church believe you don't believe it all sometimes it lets a little trial happen maybe you got a sick baby maybe something takes place right the hour of death maybe someone taken from you or something what's it to do to break you away to show you something open your eyes maybe you come to criticize sometimes maybe listen to this tape is to criticize maybe god's doing that to break some of the worldly bands that's got you bound down like a drowning man in the river you have to take the man out of the river before you get the river out of the man amen you have to get him out of the river first then you get the river out of him sometimes god has to do it that way he permits the junctions crossroads to do that stand on his promises the word for they never fail the future that's in his hand stand like they did don't don't give away abraham at his crossroads knew that god could raise up his son from the dead from which he received him at the crossroads abraham come to his crossroad [Music] but after he trusted god and seen all the miracles of god 25 years he'd wait on a boy a promised son and then god told him to go sacrifice the very thing that he waited for my oh my what a time but did abraham stagger read romans the fourth chapter said he was totally for sweet he was fully persuaded what god had promised god was able to do amen amen he permit the crossroads he was showing through abraham to us see he's able to raise the dead abraham said i'll receive him as one from the dead sarah's wombs is dead sarah's womb was dead and he his body was dead he's an old man she had no milk veins to feed the baby and they didn't have well there was nothing and he was sterile himself and she was terrible there's no way at all and he received him as one from the dead and he said if god can do that god can raise him up from the dead for the same god that he told me the baby would come and i stood and come he can raise him from the dead for he makes everything work together for the good to them amen god who made the promise in the last days these things would happen that we see happen if he promised the son and the son came if he promised all these things that we see through the scripture and it did let's get into the rhythm of it he promised in the last days these things would take place and we sit he promised he would send jesus hallelujah there will be a millennium there will be a new day there will be a day that the sun will never go down no more fallout we'll need it no more for the lamb is the light of the city to where we're going amen the dawning of a new day i feel it over me now the light of a new day a light of a day where there is no night there is no darkness no shadows no skies or no damn dark skies no midnight no graves no powers on the hillsides no funeral processions no doctors no marge amen hey man i can feel the rays of his life breaking through upon my soul the new day the old ones pressing away as i feel the mortal blood pouring through my body i feel the surge of the holy ghost coming behind rise and shine something said billy branham you're getting old you're getting weak your shoulders are dropping your hair is turning gray and falling out that's right and darkness and gross darkness upon the earth but it rise and shine i feel falling out of a surge of light of the glorious gospel of jesus christ which is maybe a new creature in him i'll look for that day amen for the new day i don't know what the future is i don't know what a whole 1964 holds for me or nothing else but i'll hold the head of him that holds eternity who is eternity amen abraham know that god could raise him up again so he trusted him so far the new year be determined to stay with his word and what it's promised like others elected did another day if you feel that you've seen the light broke through upon you of jesus christ his manifestation of his great holy spirit in these last days and remember remember stay with it what he did you're one of the elected and what he had elected in other days like abraham when he saw it when it's all against scientific proof noah's son is all against scientific proof moses saw it is all against scientific proof these smart agents has gone by but the elected who saw it stood firm amen before the future let's stand firm on the promise god made it it's up to god to see it through i'm just following the rhythm but it beats down the time it says this is the end of william bram on the earth then i'll go with the rhythm [Music] hallelujah the one that beated him beats it out beats it again it's a rhythm of god i'll raise him up at the last days he that believeth on me has everlasting life healing hath my word he believeth on him and sammy has eternal life and shall never come into the judgment let's pass from death unto life amen i'll follow the beating of the word amen not the beating of my heart the beating of the word amen no matter what it is my heart don't beat with the word then my heart's wrong amen amen for he is the word amen amen the bible tells us that god's word i was listening to a program coming up billy and i while ago and it was this uh a bible the hour call prophecy the hour of what is it called something about prophecy um voice of prophecy really it's a 70 adventists they've had four or five different names miller knights is what it was to begin with there was the one that said over there in a meeting that i claimed to be jesus christ that the holy father was old me that pillar of fire and i was jesus christ i had to be a friend of mine standing at the little meeting he raised them said you'll have to prove that because i'll call him right here i don't want you to see one time that he ever confessed that thing and like you talk about the different cults and things on the earth they know one time i tithe in with them on this sabbath question they got the old day that's passed by the holy ghost is our sabbath the bible says so come unto me all yet labor and heavy lay now i'll give you a sabbath to your soul not a day paul said you to keep a day i'm afraid of you so you're hebrews 4 to the people of god of sabbath keeping for we which have entered into his rest has ceased from our works as god did from his amen but their speaker a while ago nice program i have nothing again them i'd do anything i could to help them forgive them freely for satan because they did say something it wasn't right that's all right their doctrine is just like jehovah witness and christian science and all these other cults you see same thing but notice there's like any other organization they're more wrong against the rest of them the words always right it'll prove itself outright notice but as he was speaking the man said we've got the book of the year this writer what is his name the speaker of it i forget though just exactly what his name is now he spoke for the christian business man up in seattle here not long ago world's fair and um um he uh he said this announcer said this man has wrote the book the most outstanding book for this year i disagree the book for this year is the bible it's the light of the world it's god himself our book of the year is the bible amen for this 1964 our book is the bible and all the years to come our book is the bible all years is past it's been the book of the years past the book of the years to come and it's a book of eternity it reveals it is god amen yes it reveals god every year that is to come it's a book of the year on when ever you hear the bible say anything its promises have indicated there will come an eternal someday the bible is the one who gives us this promise when you hear the bible saying that there's coming a day when jesus will come and as i say today now i gotta close because i've been here two hours see right at it look if if the bible tells us of these things that is to come speaks of all these hours that if we pass through the days of noah is predicted the days of all these others the scripture predicted the days of martin luther was predicted the days of wesley the days of pentecostal this hour that we're living in was predicted everything happened just exactly the way it was then when what is it it's the spoken word of god which is vindicated by god makes it the light of the hour see just like the sun when the word the word itself is the light when it's vindicated for the time that it belongs to it's vindicated then it's the light of the hour john was a lot of he he was more alike than elijah and them had elijah he wasn't elijah's life but he was elijah in another form amen vindicating the light amen see he was and when jesus come he said he was a bright and shining light for a season you love to walk in his life see and john said now i must dim out i must go out now my life's finished shining i must go out he must increase he's the light he said i am the light of the world amen that's right same yesterday today forever and he's still the light of the world and what is he in the beginning was the word and the word was with god why was he the light of the world if he'd come said he was messiah and he didn't do like the bible said the messiah would do then he wasn't the light of the world amen it's the vindicated word that makes it the light of the world amen and this hour that we're living in now the vindicated word of this hour pentecostals you say speaking in tongues and so forth that was the day of pentecost amen that was a lot of the hour then this is another day it's a lot of the hour today the seventh church age all smothered out with christ on the outside the moon identifying it all the darkness coming up on the earth the light pressing in now begin to show what's going to take place the thing will be destroyed and the light will come in and destroy it and the saints shall inherit the earth the meek shall inherit the earth the earth the moon darkness will be tucked away the darkness of the night will pass away the darkness with their death and creeds and away from the word of god perverted things that they're saying and the life will break forth upon the day and remember when the full bible listen in closing when this full bible has been thoroughly vindicated then there will be an eternal shalom amen eternal peace see he come and said he was peace on earth good will towards man but the world didn't receive it see he was peace to everyone to come to him for peace see peace on earth good will to man he was the peace at that new year beginning new day of god but why he was the vindicated light of that day see but there's more word to be vindicated he's got to vindicate more word and when the last word is the vindicated is vindicated rather then death is swallowed up in victory and the dead in christ shall rise the millennium will set in and it'll be one great peace shalom let's leave for that day brother sister for that one great shalom remember the bible is the fountain of all wisdom and holds all hopes of the future to the church shalom let's pray little group present here now i've been two hours [Music] on this little new year's message you've been very patient is there one in here this morning or this afternoon rather that doesn't have shalom that peace that spoke that identified word of god when you and the word become one when if the bible says one thing and you say no i can't hardly believe it that's right then you haven't shalom you're not at peace with god because his word says one thing and you disagree with it if the word says shalom peace and you have that peace that every word that god says you can punctuate with an man and you believe it and when you see it vindicated you say amen that is the word but does a creed a light a false light the world sweep across in the shadow of the light that's been reflected to darken it out some creed to say no i think that uh that that was for something else that don't mean just that and yet the word says it are you following that shadow or are you appearing with that light here and in the tape whoever will listen at it think it over just a moment if there's one present here that would like it doesn't have that light would you raise your hand to identify yourself that you're ready to walk in that light today if there's one out in the land of where this tape shall go that you don't have it will you raise your hand to god right word turn off your recorder just in a moment when we pray get down on your knees and say lord god i've doubted i i've did this i thought well because the church said them things couldn't be and this wouldn't be and but i see it's promised in the bible and i see too many things the heavens even declared it itself and these things that are said are happening just exactly and god in heaven is declaring the same thing so i want to receive it now let the word of god come into me and let me get into the rhythm of not listening what the church or the preacher says but let me get into the rhythm of the word and see what it says and let it bring to me in this great sympathy of god a beating out of his will in my life our heavenly father we now bring to you every hand that's up everywhere and let the holy ghost of god bring to them the rhythm of the word and its truth that they are to be molded now into sons and daughters of god and they are to be the reflecting of the light of god upon the earth they are to be the manifested word that man and women are to live the way jesus lived and to to believe every word of god and live by it like he did for he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god not just a few of the words part of the words but by every word proceeding out of the mouth of god the word of moses time did not work in the days of jesus time the word the word in the days of the apostles does not work in this day it's a promised word for this day they said themselves and spoke it by the holy ghost what would take place in the last days how the churches would be heady highminded how the would rise up and the harlots would be right with her and how the they would darken the earth and the last church age the ladies jesus should be completely taken from the church oh lord let me stay with him the word manifest his light through all of us as we set forth in this new year with a determination not knowing what this new year holds but we're holding to him the word that knows the whole sympathy from the beginning to the end he knows every move in every junction and lord we're just watching him keeping our eyes on him the word then when we see these things appear we know that we're right in the rhythm of the word granted save every lost soul lord that here and everyone that hears the tape we commit them to thee for thy kingdom sake in jesus christ's name amen i was happy to be with you all this morning so i've just been exactly since i'm starting exactly two hours but from a quarter of 11 to a quarter to one i told me i said i'll be back for 1 13. i we don't believe in breaking speed off i don't think we should do that to do it now we thank you i want to say now terry turn his tape recorder off cause that's the one that goes out i think you still got yours on which is all right father will speak to the church i certainly appreciate you all down here and it's not sometimes i think this is a little retreat for me to come down here on the back side of the desert as i call him come back to the desert way back up in here and look around see this little group out here on the trees out the side of the river and uh we're on the east side of the river house and i i trust that god will bless you teaching everyone god shalom is with you that's his feet and i'm sorry to help you like this but just to get a tape of this now on if the lord willing this is what i'm going to speak on at phoenix sunday afternoon that might be a long little sharp meeting so for them purpose in the heart that shares the lord willing um i just cut and tore from side to side and we all know that the identification we know what the third pull is we all we all understand that i you got your hesitation and i thank you to slay dormant for a little while until a great hour of persecution comes on that's when you give speech you'll be manifested in just like this five straight times without your perspective and now i think just wait to see what you're now i'm going back to saying again good to find out short meetings and we'll kind of get out every night early have this 30 minutes talk on something about divine healing or something like that and whenever i get ready to make a tape again i'll either run down here to the back side of the desert or up to the tabernacle or somewhere where you can make a piece or would be among ourselves i'm not say what i wish you like that but see jesus remember see i have to watch when i see that people just completely irritate me walking away i think i'm trying to express it this morning it's gross darkness upon them they can't help it i'll forgive them or not listening and seeing the things that god has done and still they don't do it i still freak god forgive it and i need it from my heart don't say it because my master says but uh i want to feel in my heart first that i really do i don't isolate myself from people i don't want to do that because i'm i have a message for them separation i have a lot of moments see now i go out with the trinitarians with methodist baptist lutheran pentecostals seven day adventists and everything else because i'm seeking to save that which is lost if i can't to bring it in to show god and the lord be with you not head of uh our first little group of meetings here i don't know where you have been not the schedule here if some of you use the how to leave it laying here pastor reid forward to do that and if the lord willing that is the lord willing to have no leaning for him this do whatever i can and if you got any loved ones around in there would like to come to one that means why you're writing a letter tell them to tame one of these beats god bless you ignite seeing your brothers stricker and sister stricker and all the rescue people you're not some of them i don't even know your name but i know you by the witness of the holy spirit that you're my brothers and sisters and my love and respect for you and it's such a great pleasure to be down here with you and i know how you you had your dinner set you're going to have a little fellowship dinner which is possible i could stick around and and i know it's good i i know you got the best cooks in the country i know that's right but i'll probably have to get mine on my hamburger said would you go down there and preach to 30 people when you could be preaching the same thing to ten thousands certainly i don't make any surprise i want to see what you see that's not your pearl before slime they turn and trap them under your feet and then or turn it wrenchy but you don't catch your turtle there and i feel that what i say here does not have these pearls before sperm i think it's showing children jewels that belong to the emphasis the words that you will found sometimes in the mustang dirt you ever know what the lilian word comes from right out of the bottom of the slimy skillet pond and it's horrible day and night to get it done to the light but when what gets to the light zooms out the most beautiful flowers and that's what the lily is it comes up from the dirtier than the film that's where the jewels are found wrapped up here in the golden state of the nation where you find gold down in the dirt where do you find the grooviest jewels in the mustard that's where we all come from of the world i'm a prospector part of the prospects to do he hunts for gold then what he does he shines he keeps it out and he smells it and he gets it ready this is the gold miner and i'm looking through here all the time for beautiful jewels i mean find them out here somewhere in the dust and polish them and say boy here they are here's a brother you're the born again christian you're the fine young lady here's the fine middle-aged old woman not young woman whatever it is you're the argument you put in your crown lord you'll shine forever and ever like that until i see it shalom philosophy all righty praise the lord that was our last section of shalom amen let's go through the questions here question number one scripture is god's let's look here at paragraph 168 on page 29. now to you adults the scripture is god's symphony we made that easy that's word for word amen the scripture so brother brethren's going to start taking a type of a symphony he's going to type it with god scripture so let's read that for just a little bit here he said yes hallelujah only the composer knows what it really means and he reveals it to those who are listening you are interested in knowing what the drama is but you'd have to know about the sympathy first see it's not just something you see it's the changing the junctions of the word of the music it throws sometimes it's going this way for a while a certain beat after a while changes all around what is it to you who wouldn't understand it or don't know anything about it not interested in it it's just a racket it's just a fuss but to those who know about it they're watching for it they know it's coming hallelujah so brother branham's taking this type of a symphony and he typed it with god's scriptures but he makes it the living scriptures not just the written word the written word is the sheep music but all the musicians have to be reading from the sheet music amen and they got to get into the spirit of the composer and know the composer the author who wrote it but brother brandon when he says the the the god the scriptures is god's symphony he's not talking about just the written part on paper but he's talking about that made alive because he says there's junctions there's beating out there's changes that's when the words made alive and there's been junctions all the way through through each church age was a junction amen and so that part of the written word had to come into manifestation and each junction had to be caught let's look at this paragraph 169. uh no i'm sorry let's skip over to 178 i want to read another part of this here uh page 31 178 but those who wait upon the lord those who are looking not one man that we have in history of any observatory know that star that passed over but the wise risen followed it for hundreds of miles for two years they watched it and followed it see what i mean it's to those who are listening to the sympathy you see these wise men brother bam tells us in another message we're taught by daniel the prophecy of the coming messiah and daniel's taught them the stars and they were watching for the day the prophecy would be fulfilled and when they saw in the stars which was the first the first bible written in the stars when daniel taught him how to read the symphony in the stars when they saw the change the junction they got in the motion and they followed that star amen so they were watching for it and he says no other observatory noticed it but the ones who are watching for it paragraph 179 remember the composer knows the end from the beginning he knows all about it that's the reason he could write it here correctly now you must begin with him you must begin if you want to hear a sympathy you begin with him like in the music at the sympathy you listen you know what it says it's going to be what the symphony is then you begin to listen at the music and you know what it is so you know just about here's where certain certain things take place now it's got to change now anybody else that don't know nothing about there just walked in and sat down it's just a bunch of nonsense rattling noise but the one who knows what it is it's beat out with the music drummed out with the notes it's trumpeted with the trumpets it's strung on the harp it's played with the violin it's beat on the uh the bass it's sounded by the trumpets it's beat on the drums the whole thing together in rhythm and it makes the drama until you can close your eyes and live in it [Applause] are you living in it amen why because because we got in the spirit of the composer by the baptism of the holy ghost we read the word we're seeing what's happening amen when we see things transpiring we're catching the change in rhythm we're catching the music as it's moving amen it doesn't just stay in the same pattern all the time but the symphony moves and it ebbs and it flows and it has transitions and times for different instruments to come in and come out and move and crescendo and all these things are happening and we've got to be moving with it amen we're all the different instruments we're all the musical instruments let's continue on here man could man could close his mortal eyes to earthly sight and live in the presence of jesus christ when you see his word being beat out in the great sympathy that we're living in now changing you must begin in the symphony the only thing you can do if you're in the symphony then you start you begin to get into the rhythm that's the way you do god you don't stand off and look at it you get into the rhythm of it how do you get in there you're born into it into the rhythm of the word when you become part of that word you had to become part of the dance to get out of the dance you have to become part of the ball game something you're interested in to get in the ball game you see you understand so many people say i don't get what's going on i don't understand what this and i don't understand that because you got to be interested in it and you got to get into it you got to be born into you got to be born again amen and then you've got to be interested in it and in it you've got to be eating on the word gotta be interested in the message of the hour got to be interested in what's god doing and the fellowship on the word you can't we can't just be a bystander because then it starts to become a racket it starts to become noise because we don't know where we are in the junctions we don't know what part the piece is being played we've got all of the music laid out before us but we're not we're not understanding what part's happening now but you've got to be born into it and then you've got to get interested in it and you've got to get into the rhythm of it how do you get into the rhythm of it be in the church services read the message on your own read the word of god be in prayer and be in fellowship with believers not to play volleyball but to talk about the music to talk about the word the symphony and where we're at and what part you've heard and what is exciting about the junction in the change then you get into it and then it's no longer a racket or a noise you understand you can close your eyes and just live the drama oh praise god i love it when he does stuff like this paragraph 182 you have to become part of the word to know god's sympathy his sympathy is when it's playing you understand you're marching with the beat of time you're watching for it the works that i do show you also greater than this shall you do these last days oh my the great changing of the time we get into the beat beat of the word find his purpose the hour that we're living get into the rhythm of it how how he does it if you get into the word you find out how he did it at the beginning then you know how he's doing it all the time praise be to god oh i just want to say get into the rhythm of it friends get into the rhythm of it be in the fellowship on the word be fellowship around the word amen be into the word into the messages just get into it and say god get me into the rhythm of your word i don't want to miss when it's time to play my part brother bam said sometimes he talks about symphonies and a lot of other message but another message he says sometimes it'll be that one person that's got the ting on that symbol in that one certain spot but they got to stay with all the instruments they got to stay with the music stay with what's happening get into the rhythm or they won't know it's when it's their turn to hit the symbol and they may sit there amen he talks about different abilities and different gifts and all of us have something different to do and that one that's going to play the simple the the symbol he may only play one time he only may ting that symbol a few times throughout the music but he's got to stay in rhythm with everybody else to know when to ting it he can't say well i just got a little gif and i'm only used once in a while and i'll just sit over here and fold my arms and wait for somebody to call me no he's got to be right in the rhythm of the music to know when it's time to ding the symbol all of us no matter how many times our gift is used or how infrequently our gift is used it doesn't matter we all got to be into the rhythm of the music and we've got to catch all the junctions and all the timing and all the ebbs and all the flows whether used a lot or used a little it doesn't matter we all got to be in tune with the symphony the symbol tinged at the wrong time sounds weird and when it's time for it to play nobody else can make that nobody else can fill that gap we gotta all be in the rhythm amen question number two how was brother branham's teaching on the church ages vindicated now if you know the message you can say all kinds of stuff but i'm just talking about what he says in this message how was brother branson's teaching on the church they just vindicated let's look at paragraph 169 on page 29 and i want to just start with the last sentence or not the lessons the second to last sentence or third to lessons whatever we see back yonder not long ago when that church ages was being drawn out we were listening we seen it was right with the word beating with the word after a while what happened here he come himself and vindicated it he's not talking about the light flashing on the back of the wall we'll keep reading we'll find out what he's talking about after a while what happened here he come himself and vindicated it we heard the word say that in the days of the seventh angel and the church age we just said the seventh angel's message would be the last message and then all we find out over here in revelation 10 and the days of the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of god should be finished the seventh seal would be pulled back it should be there then all at once when it's happening a vision broke said go to tucson a great noise will take place at this time so you'll be thoroughly understanding and know that it's sent it'll just shake the earth nearly all of you know what about it it's on tape months before it happened then it happened then appeared in the sky shalom what is it it's a changing beats the symphony when did he come himself to vindicate it when he showed up in the cloud and then appeared in the sky shalom peace good morning the breaking of a new day amen then appeared that's how he vindicated the church ages that's how he vindicated the seventh church age messenger in his message but the man said that cloud is a vindication in my ministry that it's right that i told you the truth hallelujah what is that cloud represent him he come himself and vindicated it what is he the shalom amen appearance guide the good morning let's look at paragraph 173 when we hear the sympathy beating changing fixing to change his junction time we notice as he begin to beat and we've seen the works that i do shall you do also and greater shall you do greater he promised it we wondered how it could be but did you notice when he performed his first miracle he took water and turned it to wine is that right he took water which potentially someday might have been wine but it was water first and when he fed 5000 what did he do he took something that had been like water he took a fish that once swam was born from an egg and he broke it and another fish growed into the creation that was the original creation he took bread that was once wheat and with seed and became bread and he break from this bread and the creation only multiplied but in the woods there was nothing there to make us to make a squirrel let there be and there was without anything to break it from what is it the same jesus christ who was that he said it was jesus christ it wasn't william branham it was jesus christ the same jesus christ see greater things than this will you do for i go to my father not take something that's been created break something from it and multiply creation but absolutely create showing that he's the same jehovah that stood back there and said let there be light and there was light his word was made manifest when he was made flesh on earth he took his original creation broke it back and multiplied it but now in the last days when he comes down among us again the same light that moved down said let there be light see just speak the creation into existence greater than this will you do for i go to my father remember we're at these times so who was it that came shalom jesus christ himself amen who was it that could create could speak and create amen it was a body of flesh but it wasn't the body of flesh did it it was jesus christ who was hiding in that body of flesh showing that it was jehovah the same one that said let there be light was the same one that could speak and it come into existence he was using the lips in the body of a mortal man it wasn't the mortal man it was the life inside the mortal man now let's go to paragraph 266 all the way back on page 44. just want to drop this in i thought this was super timely paragraph 266. and we all know that's the identification we know what the third pool is we all we all understand that now you got it you'll have it the tape and i think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on that's when it be it'll speak it'll be manifest just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly and now i think just wait see to see what it done will it be manifest when when this great persecution comes down so brother branham won't be here so where will it be manifest so when it's manifest if it's like this he said like the straight five times if it's like that it could be creating an act of creation then who would it be would it be the lips of it would be the lips and body of human beings on the earth and the bride but it wouldn't be those human beings it would be jesus christ himself in bride form it would be the same jehovah driver that said let there be light if it would manifest again in a body of believers it won't be the body of believers but it'll be the same jehovah gyra in a body of believers that's why you can't take this upon yourself and just do it it's got to be by permission because it's him it's not you it's not your this is not the power of your vocal cords amen it's him saying it's time you speak and when you speak it happens because he's got us under total control by preeminence that's what he had in the prophet he had preeminence that's what he had in jesus christ and that's what he's going to have in us we can't surrender enough friends we can't die out enough we can't surrender enough we can't give up enough amen i can't get there fast enough amen but it's going to take a total surrender question what did they kill jesus for let's go to paragraph 184 and i'm going to turn in the bible here to john 10 i want to read out of john 10 verse 30. john chapter 10 verse 30 and 33 just to get the context of what brother is going to say verse 30 jesus says i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him jesus answered them many good works have i showed you from my father for which of these works do you stone me the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man maketh thyself god i want to ask you a question when brother venom talked about squirrels and an act of creation and said it's the same jesus christ who did he make himself amen all right paragraph 184 jesus brother ben answers the question for us what did they kill jesus for you being a man make yourself god brother brahm said when they go to say when you go to say my father and i are one and them other things they'll take up stones to stone them the shuck will pull away from the wheat they won't like it 185 you got my message on three types of believers how that one stood there there was the make believers they followed along for a while making out like they believed and one day jesus said to them what will you think when the son of man which is from heaven ascends back into heaven and come from heaven going back to heaven why the multitude walked away and said this is a hard saying then there come the make-believer that was walking with him the 70 and they got something hard they didn't see that they didn't know the sympathy they didn't know the promise that this child was jehovah they saw the miracles they saw the signs the wonders the works but they missed the word that this was jehovah his name shall be called counselor prince of peace the mighty god and when he said when when i ascend up to heaven from which i came well they said this is a hard saying who can understand we know you're just a man we eat with you we sleep with you we're in the woods with you we're by the waters with you well you're merely a man and say the son of man goes back to where you come from what will you say this is a hard saying see they didn't know the beat they didn't know the rhythm of the sympathy of god's word that he was god manifest in the flesh for he was the vindicated word light of the hour they didn't get it they said this is a hard thing who could understand this and they turned away they didn't know the beat then when we notice again there was a judas the make-believer or the unbeliever that waited till he found a fault then he turned to the disciples in just the twelve and judas was one of them he said you want to go too then peter said who would we go to lord you're the composer peter was reading from something else you're the composer you know how it's going on you're the only one that has the word of life where could we turn to we couldn't go back to the pharisee or a sadducee or the herodian or whatever it might be you're the one that has the word of life we have no other place to go we've joined ourselves to this great concert we are in here we're listening and we're in the rhythm we believe that you are the son of god the manifest of jehovah we're sure of this we don't know what these great trials and troubles and afflictions and things and you say you're going up to be offered up and all this that and the other on the third day all this stuff we don't understand that but we're in listen to god's sympathy we're part of it and we're waiting to see what takes place next and we're following close with you oh my that's what i want to do i want to be in the rhythm of it so i know that this part is of god well what about this question answer this for me brother chad how will this be i don't know but i'm in the sympathy and i know this is right and i'm not leaving it i'm just marching along and i'm going to catch every change of the beast every change in the music i can't answer the questions now but they're going to come a time i can answer that question but if you leave now you'll never answer the question amen judas left and couldn't answer some questions amen but peter stayed and he could answer all the questions you got to stay with the music you got to get in the rhythm and know this is beating according to the word so far this is the word this is beating according to the word i'm sticking with it because this is i'm in the symphony this is on the sheet music i'm in the rhythm and i've caught it and i'm not leaving this amen everything else will be answered if i stay with the composer and stay with the music praise be to god amen question number four what are the growing pains of his grace i like this section let's go to page 34 and start here with a little section and then jump over what are the growing pains of his grace paragraph 201 i want to grab this for context this doesn't necessarily answer the question but it lays a good foundation many people ask why they ask they ask sometimes they ask me why why must think these things happen why why did this happen to me why did i start and this happened i had this trouble here this upset me here and i lost this here sometimes i've asked why why when i was just a young minister first started out did god take my wife right out from under me take my baby right from beneath me right from beneath my heart why did he do that i didn't know i do now i just held my hand in his and kept trusting he knows every junction he knows the rhythm when it must take place he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what kind of material he's going to use see the back side of the desert sometimes where god molds righteous men into sages and prophets see see that's where men are beat out men are beat out in the word when they got all kind of creed and stuff in them let them come to the word and god beats it right out of them molds it right into this into the great sympathy with of his word see and then they see the word moving on now let's jump over to paragraph 216. you say brother branham paragraph 216. brother branham what about my mother my dad what about my people what about my denomination what will they do they'll cast me on if you can't look ahead look up don't try to look ahead anyway put your hand in his let him lead you look up don't look ahead you say why why others make fun of me about my long hair am i taking off shorts and about my leaving the church huh suffering for his namesake is growing pains of his grace there's the answer to our question suffering for his namesake is growing pains of his grace yes suffering for his word see is growing pains of his grace yes sir just remember it's the grace of god has been given to you have you ever suffered for his word that's growing pains of his grace like paul said hallelujah he had an infirmity something was bothering him the devil would buffet him blow after blow he consulted the lord three times to take it away from him i don't want this lord take it away from me and then one night the lord spoke to him said saul or paul my grace is sufficient he said then i'll glory in my infirmity i'll glory in it i know you're the healer i've seen you heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils open the eyes of the blind but if i've consulted you and you tell me it's your grace is sufficient then this devil that bothers me is the growing pains of your grace then all glory glory and my infirmities why if lest i get exalted above the abundance of revelation see see he had something the other disciples didn't have he saw him after his death burial resurrection and ascension he saw him some of them say well i walked with him so did everybody on the street but after he was dead buried rose ascended up and returned back in the form of pillar of fire he talked to paul that was more than any of the rest of them had he said except i get exalted and want to build great big seminaries and everything else and great big something another lest i get exalted above the abundance of this revelation god let a messenger of the devil keep me beat down i just want to tell you something friends if you think that god's given you a greater revelation then hold on because god always works in equity he doesn't ever let anything get out of balance and that's why as the bride comes closer and closer into the image of jesus christ with greater and greater revelation on the word and power there's going to be greater and greater tightening up because god keeps everything in equity and we wonder like we get we take spiritual growth and then we have natural problems car breaks down financial problems uh hurtful things in families hurtful things in churches things that happen why because god keeps everything in equity he's never going to let you get puffed up or elevated because god loves you and wants you to have the right kind of character that it takes to manage the revelation that comes you know like why is it always like just when things get a little bit better naturally speaking we get crushed back down we get a little bit of money in savings and the car breaks down things go smooth just a little bit and somebody else starts a fuss and a fight or something else happens in the church what is it friends it's god keeping equity it's growing pains of grace it means there's an attack against us all of a sudden somebody says something for what i believe in hey it's growing pains of his grace and it breaks your heart and it rakes you down and puts you on your knees to pray why because with a revelation there has to be a character to handle the revelation god keeps everything in equity so when those things happen and troubles in the church and troubles from outside and troubles from family and troubles at work and all kinds of accusations and all kinds of hurtful things just let it have its way let it do what it's supposed to do go to your knees and say god i submit to the trial keep me humble keep me pure god let a messenger of the devil keep me beat down he said then when i'm weak i'm strong i think that's where god wants us is totally dependent when i'm weak i'm strong amen amen growing pains of his grace amen he could stay on that a long time an hour and 45 minutes has passed and we're suffering his grace pains oh he may let crossroads he may permit crossroads to try us to perfect us for his service he may permit that now church both here and on tape he may permit the crossroads for our service like he did daniel he give daniel a little crossroads one day you know he was a great man down in babylon he did he let the king turn against him and throw him in the lion's den it only perfected him did you catch that he let the king turn against him so daniel never cursed the king and he never said evil things about the wise men and influenced them because god let it happen we've got to focus our vision and make it a scriptural vision to have a scriptural response [Applause] do you never say daniel say them nasty them horrible wise men they've always been out to give me and that king used to be my friend he just submitted he'd submitted to the trial i mean he did what he always did knowing he didn't try to bypass it he did what he always did and prayed knowing what result would come but he put himself in god's hands he didn't try to take care of himself and whatever god permitted he allowed and daniel submitted to it and god give it a supernatural protection and when god took daniel out of the lions then daniel did not have to make things right god made things right god proved the heart of the king amen when he moved on the wise men and blinded the king to their to their ideas to get daniel in the lion's den he just as quickly opened that king's eyes to put the wise men in the lion den the bride does not have to defend herself everything that comes comes for a purpose and if there's any reward to be meted out god will meet it out all we have to do is love be kind amen and submit to whatever god has for us amen he let the king turn against him and throw him in the lion's den it only perfected him sure did let the hebrew children go into the fiery furnace they was determined to stand for his word he may permit crosswords let them laugh at you and having long hair let them laugh at you for saying why you become a holy roller or whatever more it may be they may let you laugh they may laugh at you for that but that's all right that's a crossroad that's a junction that's to prove something see he says he may permit crosswords but he means crossroads let them laugh at you who let who do what so god let them laugh at you have you had somebody laugh at you for what you believe who let them laugh at you and if they stayed alive while they were laughing at you for staying with the word then god permitted it and don't fight it just let it be let it let it work whatever god wants it to work that's to prove something paragraph 2 26 the only thing that the crossroads did to the hebrew children that stood on the word it only loosed them from the bands that had around their feet and legs and sometimes it takes the hard trials to break the bands of the world off of us sometimes god lets us have a little trial you know to see what we'll do to take you out of the world or other words let you have a little trial knock you out of that organization and that idea that the method is the only one the baptist or the pentecostal that's the only group that they got if you don't believe it like my church believes it you don't believe it at all sometimes he lets a little trial happen maybe you get a sick baby maybe something takes place right at the hour of death maybe someone taken from you or something what's it to do to break you away to show you something open your eyes maybe you come to criticize sometime maybe you're listening to this tape just to criticize maybe god's doing that to break some of the worldly bands that's got you bound down praise god let the trial work friends let the crossroads do what they're supposed to do sometimes we get too caught up in this life and the things of this life and god lets the little crossroads come a little junction come amen just so we'll go back to our knees and surrender once again just so he can break another little hold off that we didn't even realize was holding on to us if you're a child of god and you say every time i move forward something happens and every time something breaks something happens since they praise god he loves me and he's perfecting me don't fight against god don't get angry with god and don't get angry with goals that god lets laugh at don't get angry at those that god let's throw you in the lion's den don't fight anybody just let god have his way let's turn to paragraph 242 there's just a couple things i want to bring out that i found to be really amazing paragraph 242 actually we're going to start a pair of 240. i just want to catch brother branham's attitude i love his attitude this was a this was a a son of god that came to harvest maturity the first one it was a wave chief offering and i just love the way he handles things paragraph 240 they was the one that said over there in a meeting that i claimed to be jesus christ that the holy father was over me the pillar of fire and i was jesus christ that's the millerites or the seventh-day adventist they made that statement that he said that then let's go down to paragraph 246 242. but their speaker a while ago nice program i have nothing against him i'd do anything i could to help them forgive them freely for saying it because they did say something that wasn't right brother ben said forgive them freely for saying it they were accusing him of preaching false doctrine they were accruing of him claiming to be jesus christ and that the holy father was over him the pillar of fire and that he was jesus christ they were making an accusation that would ruin his ministry but he said i have nothing against them i'd do anything i could to help them forgive them freely for saying it because they did say something that wasn't right but that's all right their doctrine is just like jehovah's witness and christian science and all these other cults you see same thing but notice they're just like any other organization they're no more wrong i guess than the rest of them that's baptist methodist catholic brotherhood just lumped them all together that means baptist doctrine is not going to save you any more than jehovah's witness or christian science our seventh-day adventist no more wrong i guess than the rest of them the words always write see it'll prove itself outright so if you're staying on the word you have nothing to prove the word will prove itself outright you have nothing to defend you have nothing to fight for you just stand on the word and the word will prove itself outright [Music] let's go to paragraph 2 68. in the same vein brother talking about forgiveness that was somebody who spoke evil about him said something they taught wrong and he forgave them freely now paragraph 268 remember see i have to watch when i seen them people just completely arrogantly walk away i think i've tried to express it this morning it's gross darkness upon them they can't help it i forgive them c for not listening brother abraham had to fight through to this position because remember when he preached standing in the gap in 1963 he had got his feelings hurt amen and he built up a complex because they weren't listening to him and he wanted to go on to the wilderness and and god chastised him and dealt with him he said you'll be a bomb and your wife will leave you and he went through this whole experience and come back and pre-standing in the gap and says now i'm still pre-standing and i'm explaining he said my and i'm still not right my attitude's still not right because i think they still i think they ought to have heard me but he worked his way through that to get to this point so when i've seen them people just completely arrogantly walking away i think i've tried to express it this morning it's gross darkness upon them they can't help it i forgive them see for not listening and seeing the things that god has done still they don't do it i still pray god forgive them and i mean it from my heart don't say it because my master said it but i want to feel it in my heart first that i really do i don't isolate myself from people i don't want to do that see because i have a message for them salvation what's brother branham's message it's [Applause] salvation have to go out among them now i go out with the trinitarians with the methodist baptist lutherans pentecostal seventh day adventist and everything else because i'm seeking to save that which was lost if i can so where is he going he's going amount among the denominations to save that which is lost because he's got a message of salvation what do we have a message of salvation well i've got the message you believe this after you're saved no this message is salvation and this day this message is salvation that's why brother bradham wouldn't let the hurt pull him away and isolate himself they didn't listen he said it's gross darkness they couldn't help it i forgive them and i pray to god god father forgive them oh i love that attitude friends that's the attitude we need to have regardless of what somebody says i mean it doesn't matter if they're on the outside or on the inside whatever they say against them freely forgive them god keeps a good record and god keeps things in equity but you know what i don't even want them judged i want brother branham's attitude we'll say god forgive them i don't want them judged i don't want them lost i don't want them hurt i want them forgiven [Applause] that's the right attitude friends that's the attitude we have to have so many times well they don't listen to me well you're cruising for a bruising buddy brother branham didn't have that attitude his attitude was father forgive him i forgive them i hold no odd against him i forgive him and now father you forgive them because brother benham knew that his forgiveness alone wasn't it god had to forgive him too because they didn't just reject him they rejected god and the same thing's true today amen before god can forgive them you have to forgive them sir and then pray that god will forgive them that's the right attitude friends that's what this shalom message brings that's what this life of jesus christ in the bride that's the kind of attitude it brings praise god we could go on that a long time but praise god we'll pick it up sunday let's look at paragraph 246 a line down here with just a couple points i want to draw out 246. i just want to look at this shalom this light this good morning before we finish this message look if the bible tells us of these things this that is to come speaks of all these hours that we've passed through the days of noah's predicted the days of all these others the scripture predicted the days of martin luther was predicted the days of wesley the days of pentecostal this hour that we're living in was predicted everything happened just exactly the way it was what is it it's the spoken word of god which is vindicated by god makes it the light of the hour it's not the light of the hour because you say it's the light of the hour it won the light hour just because brother branham said it was the light of the hour it's the spoken word of god which is vindicated by god makes it the light of the hour see brother all the way back at the beginning of the message he laid down this he said when god spoke the spoken word of god said let there be light but it wasn't light until the light come into manifestation then it was vindicated word and that's the way it is there's scriptures written for this day and god has to vindicate it and when that word is vindicated it's the light of the hour just okay let's read that again what is it it's the spoken word of god which is vindicated by god makes it the light of our just like the sun is that's what i just explained when the word the word itself is the light when it's vindicated for the time that it belongs to see it's vindicated then it's the light of the hour that's why he said luther's day won't work in this day and when wesley's light won't work in this day message it won't work because it's got to be the word itself is the light when it's vindicated for the time that it belongs to it's got to be the right word and the right time praise god all right see it's vindicated dennis the light of the hour john was the light he was more light than elijah and them had elijah he wasn't elijah's light but he was elijah in another form of vindicating the light he was and when jesus come he said he was a bright and shining light for a season you love to walk in the light and john said now i must dim out i must go out now my lights finish shining i must go out he must increase he's the light praise god john was the morning light and jesus was the sunlight brother branham was the morning light amen the seventh church age messenger amen but that one who came in the cloud was the light the shalom the good morning and where did he go he come down to be united with the bride the headstone on the body amen the body of jesus christ that's where the light is 249 he said i am the light of the world amen that's right the same yesterday today and forever and he's still the light of the world and what is he in the beginning was the word and the word was with god why was he the light of the world if he'd come said he was messiah and he didn't do like the bible said the messiah would do then he wasn't the light of the world see it's the vindicated word that makes it the light of the world and in this hour that we're living in now the vindicated word of this hour pentecostals you say speaking in tongues and so forth that was the day of pentecost that was the light of the hour then see this is another day he's the light of the hour today the seventh church age all smothered out with christ on the outside this has nothing to do with the church ages there's nothing to do with the laodicean church this is a new day this is the rising of the sun this is shalom now listen when he says this said why was he the light of the world this is in the middle of paragraph 249 if he'd come and said he was a messiah and didn't do like the bible said the messiah would do then he wasn't the light of the world what if she says she's bride but doesn't do what the bible says the bride would do or be like the bible says the bride will be the prophet of god says she will be him she will be in his very likeness and what if she takes a an angry contentious hateful unforgiving attitude she wouldn't be the bride because it wouldn't be the vindicated word [Applause] we understand now you can say we're bright all we want but it's got to be vindicated by the life that's living out the word it's got to be the same life that was in jesus christ has to be the same life that's in the bride what we saw on the wave sheave we need to see and the rest of the grain that comes to maturity so you've got to do what the word says shall do and be like what the word says shall be like let's turn over to paragraph 260. on page 43 the middle of the page page period 260. the word of moses time did not work in the days of jesus time the word the word in the days of the apostles does not work in this day it's a promised word for this day they said themselves and spoken by the holy ghost what would take place in the last days how the churches would be heady highminded how the would rise up and the harlots would be right with her how they would be dark and dark in the earth in the last church age the laodicean jesus would be completely taken from the church oh lord let me stay with him the word and manifest his light through all of us as we set forth in this new year with a determination not knowing what this new year holds but we're holding to him the word that knows the whole sympathy from the beginning to the end he knows every move in every junction and lord we're just watching him keeping our eyes on him the word then when we see these things appear we know that we're right in the rhythm of the word granted i want to pull three phrases out of those just couple sentences i read in paragraph 261 first sentence let me stay with him the word go down a couple lines but we're holding to him the word a few more lines keeping our eyes on him the word what is the word it's him who is he the word and not the word in another day that was him too but to have him you've got to find him today which is the manifested word today and that's him praise be to god let's look at paragraph 232 i want to close with this paragraph 230 to you the dawning of a new day i feel it all over me now do you feel it all over you is it the dawning of a new day i feel it all over me now the light of a new day the light of a day where there is no night there is no darkness no shadows no skies no dim dark skies no midnight no graves no flowers on the hillside no funeral processions no doctors no more gay men i can feel the rays of his light breaking through upon my soul the new day the old one is pressing away as i feel the mortal blood pouring through my body i feel the surge of the holy ghost coming behind it rise and shine hallelujah can you feel it is this your new day experience praise god because if you can experience the rays of the light striking your soul then you're going to see the actual rising of the sun when it comes time to move into the millennial reign hallelujah let's all stand musicians if you can come brother jim if you can make your way here please let's just pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord god we so appreciate your word lord that you would put it in the heart of a prophet lord first that you would send a prophet and you would send the prophet in a day when tapes can be recorded and that you would direct that prophet to store up the food because he said someday you'll need it and this is the day we need it lord this is the hour that we need this food and we're so thankful lord that you made provision for us years ago that we would have the food that we needed for strength in this hour god i pray that you would take the nourishments as we fed on this word and bring it into our spiritual bodies and make a strong lord make us able to endure with stamina amen to do the job that you've called us to do in this hour let us continually feed on this word and make it fresh manna from heaven for us and lord may you be our shalom our good morning our peace in the midst of all darkness in the midst of every storm may your light push against the darkness may your light dispel the darkness so there'll be no darkness in our minds no darkness in our bodies no darkness around us but lord that you would push it away until you finally push all darkness off of us and our atoms change god we yield ourselves to you we feel the warmth of the rays of your light shining in our souls bringing us all the way into the new day we love you father we thank you for what you're doing for us as we part and go our separate ways let us go with shalom in our hearts with a skip in our step in the middle of whatever trial we're going through right now let us go with joy overflowing lord because this is our new day this is bringing us into the millennium lord we love you we ask you to have your way with us and have preeminence and use us any way you choose to use us we thank you for every trial and every crossroads everything that was required for growing pains that we could grow in your grace everything that you saw fit to keep us in equity we thank you for it now lord help us never to fuss or to fight or to resist but always the yield into your hand and let you have control [Music] we love you lord we praise your holy name and thank you for what you're doing keep us lord as we go and let us shine a bright light lord in a dark world in jesus christ's name we pray amen praise god brother jim can we sing that song he is our peace can we sing that song
