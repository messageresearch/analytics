TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when when the hosts of Israel led by [Music] Galls of Jericho sauce from the Lord they felt the conquerors tread by faith they saw the victory ahead Victory ahead there's my head through the blood of Jesus Victory ahead trusting in the Lord I my faith I saw the victory ahead and David with the shepherd's sling and five Stones met the Giant on the field all alone trusting in the Lord he knew what God had said by me he saw the victory in your head oh there's Victory ahead there's Victory ahead ahead [Applause] and Daniel Prayed unto the Lord Thrice each day and then into the lion's den fled the way trusting in the Lord [Applause] [Music] I was tried asking for deliverance but trusting in the Lord I reckon I was dead my face [Music] hey well there's Victory ahead the blood of Jesus Victory ahead trusting in the Lord I hear the conquerors stretch my face I see the victory and when my life on Earth is done I'll not die to the raptures here my time has come I shall fly I'm trusting in the Lord I will not fear dread my faith I see the victory ahead Victory ahead there's Victory ahead through the blood of Jesus Victory ahead trusting in the Lord is [Music] [Applause] [Music] dead my face and I saw the victory ahead well there's Victory ahead there's Victory ahead through the blood of Jesus Victory ahead trust against the Lord I hear the conquer spread by faith I see the victory in moments like these I see a song [Music] to Jesus [Music] I lived up my hands singing singing [Music] [Music] [Music] all of you what's up [Music] you're singing I love you singing [Music] you see God [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] together please dear Lord Jesus I am so thankful Lord to be standing here by your grace Lord you have brought us together once again you know we don't come of our own Merit our own ability but we simply come because you've ordained it to be so we love you for that we're so thankful Lord that you first loved us we pray God that you would take preeminence among us this evening and have your way may each one of us yield ourselves into your hand Lord that you might use us that you might speak to us that you might teach us come on maybe hear from you the things that we have need of in this hour may your word Lord find a Dwelling Place in our hearts they magnify through our lives and be manifest in this flesh nor we give ourselves you ask that you would take your place at the head of the table this evening that you would break the bread of life and feed your sheep for we surrender now to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while we're standing let's look into the word let's look at first John together and then we're going to continue on with the same subject we were on last Wednesday and Discerning true love this will be part two I'll give you my subtitle in just a minute but we're going to go to First John chapter 4. we're going to say how much I enjoyed the weekend meetings it was such a tremendous blessing brother Abraham left with brother Dan Ratliff to go up to preach at his church this evening then I'm beginning on a plane tomorrow and heading to Phoenix for some meetings in Arizona so remember to keep him in prayer also brother Ben siebel let me know that he'll be going to brother Dan's this Sunday to preach up there should be praying for him as well let's look here at first first John chapter 4 verse 16. and we and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him let's go to Romans chapter 5. it was these scriptures we read last Sunday we were going to read them here's review Romans chapter 5. verse 5. Romans 5 and 5. and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us man God bless you as you take your seats so we realize God is love and they that dwell in love dwell in God and the love of God is in our bra in our hearts that broaden our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us so it's not possible to have this kind of love without god without the new birth without the Life of Christ and the inside this isn't something you can work your way up to amen this is the love of God that is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost amen but we want to talk about Discerning true love amen because sometimes like brother Branham said there's two types of love that he was speaking about mainly he was contrasting agape love with filio love and one he called an Earthly love or a human love and the other called Divine love or a Heavenly love that he was showing us the difference between the the two and he uses that example many many times where he says filial love will make you jealous over your wife if if some other man is interested in her amen even that that love can impassionate you so much that you would want to kill the man but he's at Agape Love we want you to pray for his soul that he'll be saved and so he says they're so different from one another Amen in the the Earthly love the filial love is the one that that we've grown up understanding amen but but there is another love that's much higher than that and that's what we want to focus on so in this Discerning true love part too I'd like to take for a subtitle love seeks the best for its recipient love seeks the best for its recipient and we're going to look at this from two different sides two different angles of this and I'll explain those to you as we go along I want to read this quote again from the thyatarian church age out of the church age book brother says I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the laodicean or last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God so we see we're fighting self-love and the love for material things and the self-love is so I think it's so much more uh I think it's so much more ingrained in our flesh and our human existence than we realize this self-love and pride was injected into human race at the fall during the hybridization amen because these are attributes of Lucifer himself pride and self-love amen and and through the serpent he was able to inject himself into the human race and now that was injected into us in our fallen nature and we are everyone struggling with pride and self-love love love for self and when I when I meditate on this subject when I've spent quite a bit of time meditating on it praying over it and I'm appalled I'm absolutely appalled at myself because I realize how much my selfishness is my motivation I mean if we're really honest with ourselves and really just just get down to just a CR The Brute raw honesty amen much of what we do is because of Love of self we're so motivated by these wrong motives amen and it really takes God Amen it takes the Holy Spirit to really break us out of that because it's in it was embedded in US I mean at Birth amen so now we we need the spirit of God and we need the word of God because the word is a seed and that word goes in and and brings life and and the spirit of God Amen gives life to the word we need to receive this word on love amen and let it come to life amen by the working of the spirit because we are so stuck in self -love amen self-awareness self-focus and and and and so when I really really get down to it I'm really honest and I quit making excuses for myself I realize there's way too much self-love there I'm appalled by it amen and I don't say that and awaken dimming that's the reality that's just where we're at amen we need God we absolutely need the spirit of God we need the word of God in our hearts to Blossom I mean to germinate to come to life amen by the by the working of the spirit we need it to take over amen because we don't have the capacity in ourselves we don't have the capacity to love right within ourselves amen it has to be God in us living this out so when we when we look at this when we begin to discern true love brother Branham was so good at explaining to us true compassion is to do the will of God not what we necessarily would call Compassion but true compassion is to do the will of God and and brother Venom uses this example of of God of Jesus Christ going to the pool of Bethesda where there's so many sick and lame blind Afflicted people all around the pool waiting for the troubling of the waters and hoping that they can be the first ones to get in to get healed but yet amen Jesus Christ would go there led by God Amen to work out God's plan and in so doing he'd have to walk around mothers with sick babies he would have to step over cripples and work his way through the crowd to heal one amen and brother Madam said true compassion is to do the will of God Amen it doesn't mean that Jesus had no feeling for the other people because we know he did have feeling for the people amen but he was controlled by a greater love and that was his love agape love perfect love amen so we want to get into this and start explaining some of that uh with God's help but we realize if we look at second Peter chapter one second Peter chapter one and I when when we talk about this love I'm always so reluctant because every time you explain something you hit it from one angle and then there's another angle and you never feel like you cover all the bases but I don't anyone everybody I don't want anybody to walk away feeling like agape love is somehow cold and formal and has no feeling right but agape love is not motivated by your emotions it's not motivated by emotions it's not controlled by emotions it's controlled by something higher than your emotions because your emotions are coming from a fallen creature from a fallen carnal spirit so it's not motivated but it doesn't mean amen that there's not a side effect of an emotional response to agape love remember when brother Brennan said if you ever had that feeling in your heart that thing that you would love to just take out and hug it sometime I hope you've had that yeah amen that closeness to God that that God coming and brooding over your heart and you would just love to take it out of your heart and hug it one time amen so we don't ever want to think that this agape love amen is is cold stiff rigid informal I don't wanna I I personally don't want to love God that way so praise God so in second Peter chapter 1 verse 2 and just look at this scripture for a second grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power is given unto us all things that get that pertaining to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby we are given are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue divert your knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity that's love for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be Barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so he said according to these precious promises we can be partakers of the divine nature and then he begins to explain the the the the growth uh unto adoption and the stature of a perfect man coming into the very image of Christ and add to your faith this and and then add an ad till you get all the way up amen and when you come to the end you have brotherly kindness which is brotherly love it's the word Philadelphia which means brother leilan and then upon that rest the cap of Love of Charity which is perfect love agape love amen so the the end of our growth is love the the Pinnacle that we're coming to his love because God is love that Capstone is God Amen and God is love that Capstone is love so when we grow into the statue of a perfect man coming into Perfection amen what what is the what is the the final piece is the love of God because all of this is directed by the love of God and all of this is controlled by the love of God all of this is sealed and vulcanized by the love of God Amen and so that's what we're growing into so love is not a trivial emotional subject amen God is love we're growing into the image of God Amen into the stature of a perfect man amen and to do so we will have to grow into perfect love praise God so it's it's not it's not the subject like the world takes in love it is our goal it is our destiny it is our Target let's go to First Corinthians chapter 13. First Corinthians chapter 13 and and um read about this love this word charity is the word love this word charity in the Greek is agape which is the love that brother Benham was telling us about agape love the perfect love and in First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 1 it says though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brasser tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries I want you to catch this let's just think about it though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so many times we think that understanding all the Mysteries and having all the knowledge of the word and having all faith is the destination it seems so because of the opening of the seals and coming to the revealing of the Mysteries and the understanding of what the mystery wasn't about so it seems like our destination is all faith and all Mysteries and all knowledge but that's not the destination if you attain to that and still don't have agape love it means nothing this is what Paul's telling us let's read it again and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profitests me nothing see this looks like love though I missed all my goodness that looks like love but if I do that and don't have love I'm nothing it profit me nothing verse 4 charity suffereth long now we're going to look at the attributes of perfect love because we're trying to to keep our minds in discernment of love what re what is real love and how do I discern what is real love Charities suffereth long and is kind charity Envy is not it's not envious charity vaunteth not itself it doesn't promote itself and it is not puffed up it's not vain does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own this is what I would like to focus on today love seeketh not her own but for others it's not selfish true love is not selfish amen seeketh not our own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil Rejoice is not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things and and endureth all things charity never faileth praise God so we see these attributes of this love and this is what we we want I want to focus this evening on um seek is not her own and so like I said before what we're what what my my subtitle is love seeks the best for its recipient love seeketh not her own seeks the best for its recipient love seeks the best for the one who is loved not necessarily what's best for the one doing the loving all right so last time we talked about uh true love must be sacrificial and so this will tie in with that and then we're going to go a little farther let's go to John 17 the Gospel of John 17 verse 19. John 17 and 19. and he says and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth so Jesus makes a statement for their sakes not for his sake for their sakes I sanctify myself this is what brother Birmingham says in the message adoption he said that's one of the sweetest words that I ever heard father I sanctify myself for their sake do you know he had a right to have a home he was a human you know that he had a right to have a wife he was a man he had a right to all these things but he said father I sanctify myself for their sake I sanctify myself I was talking to a little preacher yesterday going to preach for him in a few nights up here on the highway and I asked about a certain thing he said yes brother Benham but most of my people doesn't believe in that so brother Adam's questioning him about something something he's doing or preached or said and he questions brother Branham and brother bear says and then this man says yes but my people don't believe it that way listen to the dialogue I said most all of them are legalists president was asking questions most all of them are legalists yes the brother doesn't believe that but he said for their sake oh I wanted to hug his neck for their sake see I sanctify myself for their sake here's a man whose people or a little bit on the legalistic side and they're not even really believing something the right way he's got a better understanding but he is sanctifying himself for his people and brother bear said I wanted to hug him because that was right we always think it's right we always think it's right Amen to nail everything to the wall and make everything right and correct everything sometimes it's right just to endure with somebody for a little while somebody was right is not to strip them amen of what they have amen but to love them anyways and sanctify ourselves for for their sakes amen sometimes we we think being able to correct everything somehow makes us special like Jesus wasn't there able to correct everything everybody around him was doing and even brother Branham and Peregrine's testimony brother Branham tells Peregrine brother Perry where God has me most everything you do would be said to me but brother Brandon wasn't nailing him and corrected him and making him feel little he was just loving brother Perry and being a friend to him and being a brother amen so this is where uh he says I wanted to hug his neck for their sakes I sanctify myself for their sakes oh Jesus was training 12 men that through these 12 men was to take the gospel to the world and he said for their sakes I sanctify myself make yourself for your neighbor's sake for somebody else to say don't use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication be if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do so now you sanctify yourselves not for our sakes not to get something from God we sanctify ourselves so that in the eyes of others we do nothing to stumble anybody else not for gaining something from God Merit or favor or something like that but we sanctify ourselves for others sake let's look at this in the Bible let's go to Philippians I want to read several scriptures right back to back here and let's start with Philippians we're going to look at the Epistles of Paul Philippians chapter 2 verse 1. Philippians 2 and 1 if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love any Fellowship of the spirit any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vainglory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteemed mother better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross he Sanctified himself and he also offered himself knowing who he was thinking and not robbery to be equal with God he was able to Humble himself and if we know who we are we should be able to Humble ourselves for somebody else not thinking on our own things but for the sake of others on others things let's turn over to First Corinthians chapter 10. First Corinthians chapter 10. in verse 23. First Corinthians 10 23 all things are lawful for me this is Apostle Paul speaking all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not he's not only talking about edifying himself he's also speaking about others said all things are lawful for me I've been freed from the law all things are lawful to me but not everything that I do is Expedia and not everything I do will edify and he's not just talking about himself you'll find it in the context as we read let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth whatsoever sold in the shambles that eat asking no questions for conscience sake for the Earth is the Lord's in the fullness thereof if if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever set before you eat asking no questions for conscience sake but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice into Idols eat not for his sake that showed it and for conscience sake for the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof conscience I say not thine own but of the other for why is my Liberty judge of another man's conscience for if I by Grace be a partaker why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks whether therefore you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of God give none offense neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles nor to the Church of God even as I please all men in all things not seeking my own Prophet but the prophet of many that they may be saved here Paul is saying all things are lawful but not all things are expedient and not all things edify he is not talking about his own edification he's talking about the edification of those that are around him there's things that he knows are is not under the bondage of the law he's free to do but he will not do because of what it will do for somebody who's watching amen and if somebody who's an unbeliever bids him to a feast amen eat whatever they set before you amen giving thanks to God because the idol has no power over you but if the man says this was offered to an idol eat it not for the sake of him who told you not for you Paul was still free and he said do it for conscience say not your own conscience not because all of a sudden you feel guilty doing it now but for the conscience of the one who's watching amen so you don't put a stumbling stone at their feet why because love is always for the benefit of the one being loved for their benefit I'll stop for their benefit I won't for their benefit I'll not partake for their benefit does that make sense this is agape love Agape Love Will sanctify myself for their sakes I sanctify myself amen let's go to Romans 14 now Romans 14 13. Romans 14 13. let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block on her occasion to fall in his brother's way I know and I'm persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean But If thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walk us thou not charitably that means agape Thou You're not walking in love if what you're doing is offending your brother and you know it's offending your brother but you're doing it anyways because you don't have to listen to him you're not walking in love I mean if you want to do it in your own home that's fine but if you're in the presence of that brother and you know that's offensive and you know it's a stumbling block for them and you do it anyways and calling his conviction stupid that's not love will sanctify myself for another sake But If thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walk us thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of God is not meet and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost for he that for he that and these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another for meat destroyeth not the work of God all things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offense it wasn't wrong to eat it was wrong to eat when you knew your brother was offended that's what was wrong that was the Paul calls it evil verse 21. it is good neither to eat flesh nor drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak all things are lawful but not all things edify my brother you see we we even look at the scriptures with self-focus right when you read the scriptures all things are expedient all things are lawful but all things are expedient doesn't edify yeah that wouldn't edify me he's not talking about himself he's talking about his brother but we read the scriptures with self-focus and he says don't eat the meat once you know it's offered for conscience sake he's not talking about his conscience he's talking about the conscience of the one who told him but yet we keep reading scriptures with self-focus this is how ingrained this Fallen nature is in us but we got to start reading it the way it's written amen and sanctify ourselves for those that are around us amen if it's causing an offense I'll abstain with it so I don't offend my brother because that's love that's love praise God that I don't stumble my brother in these things brother Ben said in that message that Dale Calvary said he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life what is eternal life is it knowing the Mysteries no eternal life is the very life of God and God is love well you know the Mysteries absolutely because God by love has revealed them to us that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it came to the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot that they were Sons you are Sons you're taking Christ's place your son so don't live for yourself live for others well brother Brandon I can't live for this I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who'd kill you if he could if they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you get when you get that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards Calvary amen I I praise God the reality of the truth of the word is it's impossible let's just say it that way it's impossible without the spirit of God this word is so contrary to our human nature it's so contrary to our fallen condition that it is going to absolutely take the spirit of God coming and living this through US amen but we must be able to discern what is true and genuine love and one is not amen and resist the wrong and accept the riot and open ourselves to it and say go on let that love flow through me as I wrote I wrote on the white board here last Wednesday I wrote the a couple of lines one was true love sacrifice itself or the lover for the loved true love perverted love sacrifice others the loved for self perverted levels sacrifice the object of their affection for themselves that's not the love of God so and I'm going to I'm going to go a little further than that in just a few minutes let's go back to First John chapter 3. first John chapter 3. and we know that when we come to the Pinnacle of the Statue of perfect man this pyramid that brother Branham drawn out we have brotherly love and then the Capstone perfect love in First John 3 14 says we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death we're not talking about trivial feel-good love everybody love each other be nice to your neighbor that's not biblical love biblical love is much harder than that it's not give something away and help your neighbor lady mower lawn and be a nice person a genuine love is much harder than that genuine love is a death to self it's a sacrifice so he says I want to read this again verse 14 we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hate his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren this is how we perceive the love of God because he died for us he laid down his life for us we love him because he first loved us and that example is now our example that we should lay down our lives for the brethren but whoso but whoso hath this world's good and seeth his brother having need and shutteth up his boughs of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love and word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth amen let love have action not just nice words not just nice phrases amen so let's go to Philippians chapter one now I want to look back at the life of Paul for a moment Philippians chapter 1 and remember we said true love sacrifices the love or herself for the love and here Paul comes in Philippians chapter 1 verse 21. he says for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain so this is where he's at to live is Christ to die is gain but if I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet what shall I choose I want not for I am in a straight betwixture too having a desire to depart and be with Christ Which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you where did Paul want to go he wanted to go he was done he had had enough he wanted to go be with Christ but he says to abide in the flesh is more needful for you so who is Paul sacrificing himself for amen so nevertheless verse 24 to abide in the flesh is more needful for you and having this confidence I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of Faith he wasn't sticking around for himself he wanted to go he was sticking around for their further and joy of faith that you're rejoicing made me more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again let's look at Romans chapter 12 now Romans chapter 12. verse 9. Romans 12 and 9 let love be without dissimulation aboard that which is evil cleaved to that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another so this is the example that Paul has given us and he demonstrated it by the life that he lived amen but now let's go to look at Jesus in John 16. I'm wanting to jump into the next part but I want to finish this and paint this picture then jump into the next part John 16 verse 7. John 16 and 7. nevertheless I tell you the truth is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you Jesus now is looking as disciples and he's saying it's expedient for you are profitable for you that I go away and none of them believed him can you imagine walking with Jesus spending time with him being in boasts with him and along the way and in the house with him in all the meetings and working with him in the ministry and Jesus looks at you and says I'm leaving you what would you want would you want him to go away or would you want him to stay and when he told the disciples he says the son of man is going to go into Jerusalem and he's going to be crucified and killed in a third day he rise amen and Peter says far be it from thee for a thing like that to happen to thee amen Peter didn't want Jesus to go anywhere none of the disciples wanted him to go anywhere and even Jesus didn't want In the Flesh to leave his disciples brother Birmingham said he was groaning and in travail and he was in in Gethsemane because he didn't want to leave the ones he loved but but true love sacrifices self for the benefit of the loved but I'm going to go one step further if you'll allow me to true love will allow the love to suffer for the greater good of the loved we're going the next step so now true love will sacrifice self for the love for the object of their love perverted love will sacrifice the object of the love for themselves but now true love will go one step further true love will allow the suffering of the loved for the benefit of the love not for the benefit of the Lover now this isn't perverted love this is true love and true love will permit suffering for the object of their affection because it benefits the object of their affection now this comes home this is how we discern true love because sometimes when love is being manifest in a human way it doesn't look like love but it's perfect love not human love and it gets all confused in our mind and Twisted by emotions people said if you really love them how can you do that and let this happen and how can you take that action amen but true love will take the action that's most beneficial to the one love even if it causes the one who's loved to suffer that's true love that's God's love that's what God does so the love truly we love like God loves God is love so the definition of Love Is God so we want to know how love acts let's see what God did All Through the Bible and that's love so Jesus says nevertheless I tell you truth it's expedient for you that I go away it's for your best interest that I leave you and they're all saying don't leave us don't leave us where are you going to go why can't we follow this isn't going to happen to you and Peter so much didn't want him to go that Peter took out a sword and tried to kill a man amen to stop Jesus from leaving him Peter didn't want him to go anywhere none of the disciples want him to go anywhere nobody heard him say this and say oh good something good is coming our way they were going to go through a trial through a bit of suffering they were going to go through anguish and confusion and distress when he separated from them but he said it's expedient for you that I go away by going on away the comforter will not come unto you and that is going to be for your greater good brother remember said in the message I know and why does God let trouble come God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm the little Ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise after he'd went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation I've liked that poem or Psalm must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody Seas we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our Comforts is just beyond the river why does God let troubles come that's what we say every time we get in trouble God what are you doing why is this happening to me amen but but brother explains to us in the church age book or this is the message I know but it's again in the church age book that that God Amen permits troubles because God is behind the trouble working something for our benefit so pure love true love will allow the suffering of the object of love for the benefit of the object of love not for the benefit of the lover for the benefit of the object of love this isn't a perverted love it's a true love this is why when you see a parent who doesn't want to discipline their child doesn't want to correct the child doesn't ever want to tell them no spoils a child and gives them everything they want that's not love that's not love and and many times or you do it this way you say uh uh a mother or father is correcting a grandchild and Grandma amen says no you're not you're not doing that in my house takes and coddles the child says you can do that here and huddles the child and sweeps them off to the other room and gets him a piece of candy and says Grandma loves you Grandma does not love that child she loves the child with a perverted love because Grandma's heart hurts too bad to see the child corrected and doesn't want the child to cry amen or have to suffer in any way and so will not allow suffering for the betterment of the child meaning now that Grandma is in a perverted love does that make sense but true love which would allow Grandma to suffer the heartache of of seeing discipline and seeing retribution seeing the cycle go through to being a better character and self-control and the grandchild because it's better for the grandchild in the long run that would be true love true love would allow Grandma to suffer her filial feelings for agape love amen so now we can start to see this love is a much higher love Than This Feeling emotional love the feeling emotional love amen is always for the benefit of the lover but agape love is for the benefit of the one who's loved amen so God we say we ask for comfort and peace we ask for comfort and peace and God gives us the best thing to give us trials and tribulations that's that's not comfort and peace we ask for comfort and peace but he gives us trials and tribulations why because trials and tribulations are better than comfort and peace so what is it we need we need character we we need to learn about God we need to understand the word and some of those things only come by trials and tribulation and God will allow us to suffer because of love how could he allow suffering if he loves us he allows suffering because he loves us amen so sometimes it's difficult to discern true love because of the emotions it gets all tangled up I want to read two places and and the Old Testament in Exodus 13. let's look there Exodus 13. and 17. Exodus 13 and 17 says and it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God LED them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although it was near for God said less per eventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt but God led the people about through the way of the Wilderness of the Red Sea and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt so now there was a very short route to Palestine to the promised land but God didn't take him on the short easy route because God knew that if they went the short easy route they could see War too early and be discouraged so God took him on a much more difficult route and he moved them by way of the Red Sea where they would get pinned in and trapped then he would open up the Red Sea and bring him across then they would get into the Wilderness amen where their bread would run out and then he would provide bread then they would come to where their water ran out and then he would provide water he took them in a much more difficult path than the easy path right across the top skirting right around the Mediterranean Sea and going right into Palestine and you think God can do anything he wants he could just blow him away and move no God God is always doing what's best for the ones he loves so they wouldn't be discouraged before he moves them around and now what's he doing he's taking them by a harder way because the harder way he keeps reinforcing I'm with you I'm covering for you I'm parting the sea I'm feeding you I'm giving you water why well how did they know I mean how did they see God manifesting not through the easy route but through the hard route and the hard route gave God the opportunity to continually manifest his love manifests is protection and provision and Care amen was manifested in the harder way amen we wonder sometimes why is my life always the harder way amen because God has something better for you and I not the easy way it seems like life's so easy for some amen so hard for others amen give me the way that God has chose because the way that God has chose is for my benefit because his love is always for the benefit of the one who's loved he's not he's not mad at us he's not punishing us he's not trying to kill us but he's bringing us into perfection and he's showing himself Mighty on our behalf all the way along let's go to Judges chapter 3 now Judges chapter 3 chapter 3 verse 1. Judges chapter 3 verse 1 now these are the Nations which the Lord left the Lord left some Nations he didn't run them all out these are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them War at the least such as before knew nothing thereof God did not allow all the inhabitants to be driven out and bring them into a perfect peace with no more war but he left behind some Nations that would continually fight with the children of Israel so that when the next Generation came up the Next Generation amen wouldn't wouldn't be devoid of character and understanding of how to war so he left enough trouble in the promised land so that the Next Generation knew how to fight [Music] what is this brother Ted this is love This Is Love amen oh my goodness I think so many times uh when we when we begin to parent we we there's such a picture of parenting in the world that is not the right kind of parenting but if you want to be a Godly parent see how God is as a parent and mimic God so God is a father amen and you see you see a modern society where where people amen are not able to cope with anything amen they're not able to cope mentally they're not they don't have any understanding because they have never suffered there's but the the attempt has been to eliminate as much suffering as possible and and you know what I'm guilty of the same I really don't want my children to suffer I'm not trying to make them suffer but I can go overboard in my feelio love and try to to do everything for them and require them never to work never to contribute to the family never to take out the trash make their bed empty the dishes dig in the garden they always get to eat the tomatoes but nobody ever dug the weeds but you see this is the society this is where Society has gone and now kids get trophies for competing not for women so they don't have to labor and strive and work hard and overcome they don't have to overcome themselves they don't have to build up a resilience because they're getting a trophy anyways they get Advanced whether they're worth worthy of advancement or not amen they get passes at work because everybody's so desperate to have employees they can show up late they can miss days they're not going to get fired because they need warm bodies the whole thing is set up in the wrong kind of love amen and it is destroyed an entire generation and now because there's been no struggling because there's there's been no labor there's been no effort in fact there's been so much Prosperity amen that children have been given everything amen and it's even a Temptation for us to shower upon our children gifts and things and things they like there's nothing funner than knowing that your son or daughter really would love to have this thing and you secretly go get it and you surprise them with it and there's nothing wrong with that but the problem is if you've never made them go labor to earn some money to pay for it themselves you do them a travesty because when they leave home they have no understanding of what it's like and you didn't love them in loving them all their life you never loved them because everything came easy everything mom and dad took care of it they did it all amen then you have people who get married they don't know how to fill out documentation they can't go to the bank they can't open accounts they can't balance a checkbook they can't that's not love that's not love but love is saying you know what life isn't easy when you get away from Mom and Dad you're going to need to know some of these things now we're going to get up early Saturday morning that was my routine Saturday morning amen my dad would shake me out of bed way early to pick green beans and I hated green beans I mean they tasted all right but the ones in the garden I hated because it's Saturday morning and he loved to do it super early before it got hot because my dad didn't want to sweat a drop picking green bean so we'd be up there as soon as the sun was peeking Over the Horizon so it was still cool picking green beans on Saturday morning amen and and I I hated the whole process I didn't enjoy it I didn't like being in the garden with Dad I had no warm fuzzy feelings but today I'm thankful that I had a dad that would shake me out of bed and make me pick green beans and not let me lay there and says he loved me letting me sleep in that's not love you're setting them up for Destruction you're setting them up for a surprise and now these these young people that have never suffered never labored never worked amen never really had any they really never had anything they really had to strive to obtain and because of that they're going crazy they're losing their minds they cannot COPE in this world Amen because there's something so backwards about it amen here's the issue you're never going to take away suffering suffering is a part of human life so if you take away natural suffering Here Comes mental suffering and now the mental disease is on a rampage where people don't know what gender they are they don't they can't cope they can't deal with anything somebody makes fun of them on social media and they want to commit suicide it's like are you kidding me somebody laughed at your shirt and you want to kill yourself why and to them it's real I listen to not pretend because you're never going to get through life without suffering so this this doing everything for our children and providing everything they ever need and never require it doesn't matter how much money you have amen you can be sitting on a couple million dollars in the bank amen and it'll still do them good to go get a job cutting somebody else's grass and pulling somebody else's weed to buy the bicycle they want and that'll be more love than you doing it because true love is always for the benefit of the one loved and I know that my children are going to have to make it without me someday I'm not always going to be here to cover for all their mistakes I won't always be here to get them out of trouble I won't always be here to provide for their needs I I won't always be here and even at that as they get older some of their needs to go far beyond my capabilities so love will take him as children and teach them the character they need and this self-discipline and character and work ethic and and all the things that they need to make it in life so this whole modern idea of love is not love amen and then and then when you really uh have your children working I mean it's almost like your neighbors think you're running a concentration camp like how can you do that and I mean they just want to play and you work them so hard and you're and you're thinking you know let's just teleport back 150 years and see what life was like working in the garden for two hours on Saturday is not hard work I mean kids were being sent to the mines at nine years old 150 years ago maybe even less than that so we realize the perversion of love complicates everything but real genuine love is always focused on what's best for the object of love amen what why does God let troubles come God harnesses troubles puts bits in his mouth makes it obey him because those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with him the troubles are beneficial this is why brother Ben says you can't help a chicken pip its way out of the egg if you help it you'll kill it he said but oh my heart is breaking it's working so hard it's getting exhausted and look it's going as a little big I can see it's just coming through it's not coming through but oh I want to help it oh I want to help it the question is what's better for the chick for it to struggle to survive or for you to take away the struggle for survival but you can't hardly stand to watch it struggle which means Who Do You Love More the chicken or yourself you love yourself the most you say my my son came back from work the other day went and worked for the for the neighbor and he come back and the poor little thing had blisters on his fingers I can't stand to see those blisters on his fingers he's trying to save up my I'll just buy him the bike I can't stand do you love the boy or do you love yourself because you don't want to see you don't want to endure you don't want to feel that bad feeling you don't want to see the struggle you don't want to witness the hardship what about when they have a problem at work when they're 16 or 17 years old and they've got something they need to sort out amen at work and you can advise them on how to handle it or you can March in there yourself and tell that manager what you think which is better for the 16 17 year old for them to learn with your counsel give them good Godly counsel and let them go in and face the issue and work their way through it and maybe have a misunderstanding maybe have a repeat conversation and may go well may go bad but it's better for them amen that they deal with the situation then you march in and take care of it all what we'll end up doing is handicapping people so then I mean you could even take it into church you hear an instance of church discipline somebody was disciplined in the church and put out a fellowship oh how could you do that how could you have the love of God right and then all of a sudden family will come to coddle and and they'll wind up in another church and that church will bring them in and accept them that's not love now that doesn't mean all church discipline was correct and and there's not ground for that but but we have to understand true love what is true love true love as true compassion is to do the will of God and his will is his word amen and it's not loving to people to let people violate the word of God and do nothing about it that's not love but love would be and when Paul talks about church discipline he said when you gather together my spirit with is with you deliver such a one to the devil for the destruction of the flesh that the soul might be saved what's Paul interested in he's interested in the one he loves in the soul but then human emotion comes creeping in and starts tangling this web and how could you be loving how can you say you have the love of God and don't you know there's extenuating circumstances and this that and the other why don't why don't we just Flex the word to fit the situation that's not love that is not love love would be say you know what brother sister I love you but this is the word and we can't change it for nobody that's love so so many things get perverted and questioned but we need to look at the word of God and the word of God shows us the way brother man said in the message uniting time and sign he said so tension I think what is this tension brother Brandon was all tore up one day he's got this nervous thing that comes back to him he's all tense and he's and he's he's having another problem with his nerves again it was coming in cycles and he's talking about all this and he's been in prayer about it and he says what is this tension if I could have been born without this tension this is what he's thinking well if I wouldn't have had this tension I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ it's been a blessing thing to me this thing that troubled the prophet of God all his life this this this nervous tension this upset stomach the thing that took him off the field that would come amen and cycle through his life seven times and on the eighth time and God would finally deliver him from him but it troubled him so much and caused so much discomfort amen he went to multiple doctors to try to get it fixed went to Mayo Clinic went to somebody in Indiana to get a scope and he tried all these things and he comes down here in 1963 and he says this tension what would I be without this tension amen I wouldn't be what I am maybe if perhaps I wouldn't be a Christian it was this tension that drove me to Christ it's a blessed thing to me amen whatever God has in our life whatever situation we find ourselves in whether it's a family situation a marriage situation A a physical limitation a financial limitation I can say whatever God has allowed us for my benefit wherever I find myself is where I need to be because God's love has foresaw what I need that's right remember that he makes even our mistakes work together for his perfect will so even those mistakes that landed me in this situation amen it causes me to have a greater love and need for God Amen there's good things that can come from it let's go to a second Corinthians chapter 12. let me just read just a couple more scriptures as we wind down I'll say talking about my dad and the green beans I remember my dad was a truck driver all my life he drove a truck when the guys talked about my dad's this my dad's that I wasn't standing in line to confess what my dad was I wasn't the first one to pipe off my dad's a truck driver because some had lawyers for dads I went to a school that was kind of it was Springboro high school and there's a lot of lawyers and professionals and things like that and I'd see my dad put on an old work uniform and it was ugly as all get out green pants and a brown shirt with his name on it and tag and all this and he put on an old pair of boots and I watch him over and over lace up those boots and my dad uh he wasn't a sophisticated man in any way he was just a regular Regular Guy and this truck driving job would take him over the road so many days I wouldn't see my dad for three or four days at a time he'd work off shifts and all that and so it was really disruptive but when I got to be married and I got a job and I put on a uniform and I laced up my boots every morning to go out to work I thank God that I had an example that I watched over and over and saw what it means to love your family I didn't have some odd concept or some foreign idea I had witnessed that I had seen it and I become thankful for it and I was thankful for a dad and you know like I said my dad wasn't sophisticated or elegant so dad's way of telling you were wrong is knock it off knucklehead why are you so stupid I mean if that was going on in 2023 I'd need therapy and counseling I'd probably be on medication right but he was right and I'm thankful he was right and I'm thankful he told me it could have been smoother it could have been a little sweeter he could have had a nicer tone he could have used more positively reinforcing words point is I got the message and I'm standing here today thanking God that I had a father who would correct me like the Bible says we thank God that we had fathers who had correct us and they did for their own pleasure now the father God will correct us for our benefit but I'm so thankful that I had a dad who would give that example who who would show true love amen and tell me to knock it off knucklehead not the most sensitive way not really the way I want to say to my children but listen he got the point across and I'm standing here today saying thank God I love my dad and my dad loved me that's what we need more of more just somebody who's willing to extend themselves or somebody else be honest take some take responsibility for something and tell it like it is second Corinthians chapter 12. verse 7. unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations that were given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me here's the Apostle Paul beloved of the Lord First Church eighth messenger and God will allow a messenger of Satan to Buffet him with a thorn in the flesh that he sought the Lord three times to remove and God said he wouldn't and Paul recognizes because of the abundance of Revelation a messenger of Satan a thorn was sent to buff at me unless I be exalted above measure God was not punishing Paul for anything Paul done wrong God was allowing an Affliction to Paul because Paul was given an abundance of Revelation and without this Affliction he could have been over evaluated puffed up lifted up beyond measure so the love of God allowed the Affliction to keep Paul right with God so that Paul would finish his journey right oh thank God that's love that's God's love that's the right kind of love Luke 22 let's go to Luke 22. Luke 22. Luke 22 31. and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I've prayed for thee that thy faith failed not when thou art converted strengthen the brethren listen I I hope you don't believe I'm reading too much into this scripture but he says Satan hath desired to have you then he may sift you as wheat it looks to me like he was granted permission you have to say is that the love of God Satan is desire to sift you as we well Jesus tell him no tell him he can't Satan has desired he's asked he's expressed the desire to sift you as wheat well that's easy Jesus tell him he can't tell him I'm under your special protection and he doesn't have a right no Jesus doesn't say that she said but I've prayed for you that your faith fell not right and when you're converted you're going to have to go through a dark time and this is just me but maybe because you're a little too proud Peter maybe because you're a little too self-confident and you think you'll never fail and you'll never know though all men leave you and forsake you I'll not forsake you and maybe Peter you're just a little self too confident and you got just a little too much boldness and you got a little too much of a an evaluation of yourself maybe you need to be sifted a little bit but don't worry I've prayed for you and when you're converted you're going to get converted but you've got to pass through this because you need to come to a repentance and a Brokenness and a humility amen but Jesus is going to come right around and restore him amen you're going to restore him by the Sea of tiberias Amen he's going to ask him three times does thou love me does thou love me does thou love me there's a restoration coming but there's a need that you're broken there's a need that that something transpires in your life people Satan has desire to sift you like wheat but I've prayed for you all those times we've been sifted friends that wasn't a bad thing that's been a good thing all the difficult circumstances what have they done difficulty after difficulty trial after trial what has it done I don't know what it's done for you but for me it's caused me to look deeper inside and deeper inside and I realize there's more selfishness there there's too much of Chad I'm too proud too arrogant too self-focused and what it does it makes me want to I every trial every difficult circumstances makes me trust myself less I think I've told you before I'm not afraid of other people the one who's the one human being who scares me to death is me this is the one who causes all the problems this is the guy who's always getting in God's way this is the guy who sometimes thinks he knows something about it the one who scares me to death is me so God has ways of allowing us to continue to mistrust ourselves and not have an over evaluated an estimation of ourselves he allows us to fall once in a while and bump our nose and skin up our knee so that we realize God I truly can do nothing without you and friends that's love that's love not the not the not the the the him to put such a bubble around you that nothing ever happened to you so you can continue to think that you're great and special and you're overcoming and you've got all ability and might and Power Sometimes the best thing he can do is leave you to your own devices for a few minutes and let you crash and burn amen so that you come to the realization I'm nothing without you I can do nothing to me that's love that's real love brother Graham tells the story I mentioned it last time but I'm going to read it here out of the message the Good Shepherd of the Sheep he's talking to a shepherd and he's relating a conversation he says why did you break its leg saw a sheep with a broken leg why did you break its leg are you a cruel Shepherd the shepherd had intentionally broken the Sheep's leg said are you a cruel Shepherd he said no I love the Sheep but the Sheep got to running away from me and he kept straying out to itself and I know the nature of sheep and I know that if they stray too far the wolf will get them so I had to break the Sheep's leg to keep it with me to draw it to my bosom to give it a little special food and it'll be and and I'll be so kind to it that when its leg gets well it'll never leave me anymore and sometimes his brother ends going on and sometimes God has to strike us down with sickness disease and affliction that he might just woo us to his bosom and give us a little Special Touch of his Divine resurrected power to prove that he's still the Lord Jesus and a man that's ever been healed of God knows what God is he won't want to stray um God is so good let's go to James chapter one and I'd like to finish with this scripture James chapter 1. verse 2. James 1 and 2. my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire and wanting nothing why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble puts bits in his mouth it makes it obey him for those troubles bring us into a coaster Fellowship why does he let us make mistakes why how many times have you prayed God why did you let me do that you could have stopped me maybe there was something that you gained that was greater than what you lost maybe his love for Saul that you needed to lose some more Pride self-confidence needed to lose a little bit of religious spirit and maybe his Love Allowed a messenger of the devil to Buffet us a bit or maybe the devil assist us is weak and allowed us to make a mistake because we would come back to him having a greater understanding of what his love is and who we really are that's love friends that's love this whole idea is if he loves me you'll never let anything bad to happen to me that's the modern layout to see an idea and that's not love because that doesn't doesn't do what's best for the recipient of love let's all stand musicians if you'll come please so true love sacrifice self the lover for the benefit of the love but true love will also allow the love to suffer for the benefit of the love boy this makes it easier to parent doesn't it do it the way God did it amen I'm not here to run a pleasure cruise and be the tour guide for my children's life they're not on cruise my children are not on a cruise they're not here Amen on a permanent vacation but under my care hopefully they're learning some character hopefully they're learning some things that'll benefit them hopefully I love them enough to let them learn and not stop all learning amen praise God praise God Amen God is good does God love you yes and we love him because he first loved us has life been easy no but does he love us yes amen this is bow our heads and pray your heavenly father we thank you Lord for your goodness to us for your mercy and your grace Lord God when we were unable you came on the scene we couldn't foresee the end we didn't know what we needed but God you've always done what's best for us and even when it hurt Lord I'm sure the disciples were hurt when they saw you go to Calvary when they knew that you were laid in the grave and for those next two days they were in anguish and and depression not knowing what in the world was happening in their lives they didn't realize that was the greatest act of love that you were loving them they thought they were abandoned they were hurting but they were being loved God I thank you Lord in our trials and the things that have happened in our lives from our own choosing our own mistakes but that we're permitted Lord that you've brought us out of we know that you love us Lord all right I thank you for your great love and as we live in this life trying to be your representation your body on this Earth God help us to discern what is truly love God break away from us laodicean ideas of Love Of This filial Love that is so limited in inability Lord the love that's so self-centered and self-focused Lord Deliver Us from that and fill us Lord with your love Let Your Love be shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost help us to yield to that and give you room in place to express yourself in US give us the right approach give us your approach in everything we do bless your people be with us as we go from here we love you and thank you for all you're doing in our lives all you've done for us and all you've promised to do for us you're going to make sure that we don't arrive devoid of character that we don't miss what we're supposed to have you're going to make sure that we have it all we thank you for that Lord we ask you to bless us now as we part and go our ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen like
