[15:08] baby vivian grace you meant she was born

[15:14] uh they had a little bit of a trial you
[15:16] know after she was born
[15:19] um her uh blood glucose levels went down
[15:22] a little bit so they wanted to give her
[15:23] an iv
[15:24] and then they took the regular battery
[15:27] of tests the blood work and her white
[15:30] blood cell count came back a little bit
[15:31] high so they wanted to do a battery of
[15:34] tests to make sure she didn't have an
[15:35] affection so they started her on an iv
[15:38] she had to go to the special care
[15:39] nursery and get on antibiotics and and
[15:42] it was a i'm sure quite a trying time
[15:44] for sister ariel and brother luke but by
[15:47] the grace of god brother luke called me
[15:49] just a few minutes ago and he says she's
[15:51] fine and we're taking her home today
[15:52] amen praise be to god so we thank god

[16:59] love you and we had a little bit of
[17:01] fellowship the other day and it was nice
[17:02] so it's good to see you all again
[17:05] amen while we're standing let's turn in
[17:07] our bibles to genesis 2 and we'll begin
[17:09] reading in verse 8.
[17:18] genesis chapter 2 and verse 8
[17:21] and the lord god planted a garden
[17:23] eastward in eden and there he put the
[17:25] man whom he had formed
[17:27] man god bless you as you're seated
[17:30] may the lord bless the reading of his
[17:31] word
[17:33] amen
[17:35] it's interesting i've been doing
[17:37] some studying
[17:39] on a subject and i just took for a title
[17:41] mercy and judgment
[17:43] at the threshing floor
[17:45] mercy and judgment at the threshing
[17:47] floor and i'd preached a message on the
[17:49] threshing floor some time ago and i was
[17:52] just meditating on that or i've come
[17:54] across something else that i was looking
[17:56] at it reminded me of that but i started
[17:58] looking at some things the lord is
[18:00] bringing to my attention it's amazing
[18:02] the themes that run through the bible
[18:04] they're absolutely astounding and this
[18:06] one you know here we are at the very
[18:08] beginning of the book and god has given
[18:11] us for him to reveal himself to us that
[18:13] we call this book we call the bible we
[18:16] know it's a record of the book of
[18:17] redemption and we know it's also a copy
[18:19] of the marriage certificate it's all of
[18:21] these things but this in this book of
[18:24] redemption he starts off by planting a
[18:27] garden
[18:28] and this theme of gardening husbandry
[18:32] fruit production
[18:34] wheat
[18:35] all of this goes all the way through the
[18:37] bible in fact it's a consistent major
[18:39] theme all the way through the bible and
[18:41] i think we'll find as we look at that it
[18:43] it it is the theme really and so he
[18:46] started off by planting a garden
[18:48] eastward in eden and he put the man in
[18:50] his garden amen and so it's just it's
[18:53] fascinating i want to look at that and
[18:55] start from there and keep moving let's
[18:56] go to isaiah 61.
[19:04] isaiah 61.
[19:13] and we're going to read from verse 1
[19:15] isaiah 61 and verse 1.
[19:18] amen keep your bibles handed we're going
[19:20] to read
[19:22] through quite a few scriptures today and
[19:24] will take this i believe in the form of
[19:26] a bible study i for the last several
[19:28] days have been studying the bible and
[19:30] enjoying it so much i was telling
[19:32] brother jeremy he come around back and i
[19:34] said i was so much enjoying studying the
[19:36] bible tracing these things through the
[19:38] scriptures and reading the bible that i
[19:40] was just pulling together bible verses
[19:42] and all of a sudden i went into panic
[19:44] mode last night this morning thinking
[19:45] i've got to preach this like i i'm just
[19:47] enjoying collecting the verses and
[19:49] having my own private bible study and so
[19:52] i said god help me however it comes out
[19:53] is how it comes out amen but i was
[19:55] getting lost in the in the in the bible
[19:57] study isaiah 61 1 the spirit of the lord
[20:01] is upon me because the lord has anointed
[20:03] me to preach good tidings into the meek
[20:05] he has sent me to bind up the broken
[20:07] hearted to proclaim liberty to the
[20:08] captives and the opening of prison to
[20:10] them that are bound to proclaim the
[20:12] acceptable year of the lord we know that
[20:15] when jesus took the scroll
[20:17] and began to read it he stopped here at
[20:19] this comma because he was proclaiming
[20:21] the acceptable year of the lord but we
[20:23] know that the the scripture and the
[20:25] prophecy has to be completed has to
[20:26] finish and we know that we're in the day
[20:29] of the completion of this scripture
[20:31] and it goes on to say in the day of the
[20:33] vengeance of our god to comfort all that
[20:35] mourn so we've come to the day of the
[20:38] vengeance of our god we've come into a
[20:40] cycle of judgment amen
[20:42] where god is now judging the earth but
[20:44] he's come also to comfort all that mourn
[20:48] it says to appoint unto them
[20:50] that mourn in zion to give unto them
[20:54] beauty for ashes the oil of joy for
[20:57] for mourning the garment of praise for
[20:59] the spirit of heaviness that they might
[21:02] be called trees of righteousness the
[21:04] planting of the lord that he might be
[21:07] glorified
[21:08] so we see what he's coming to in the end
[21:10] when he wraps it all up he is uh he's
[21:13] going to heal zion which is a type of
[21:15] the bride and he's going to appoint them
[21:18] amen they're going to be called trees of
[21:21] righteousness the planting of the lord
[21:23] because we know that god is a gardener
[21:26] is that right
[21:27] he's playing in a garden eastward in
[21:28] eden god is a gardener and god has been
[21:31] sowing seed been planting amen and what
[21:34] he's been looking for is fruit for seed
[21:37] for grain amen to come back to him from
[21:39] his garden and in the end these are
[21:42] going to be the trees of the lord the
[21:44] the trees of righteousness the planting
[21:46] of the lord amen
[21:48] i saw that brother nate was doing a
[21:51] bible study on trees of the bible and i
[21:53] was really blessed by that because it
[21:55] was the same thing i was looking at that
[21:57] happens a lot so praise god
[21:59] let's look at john chapter 19 now
[22:02] and go over to john 19.
[22:09] i just want to catch a few scriptures in
[22:11] a way of a theme
[22:14] john chapter 19
[22:19] verse
[22:20] 41.
[22:25] this is we're dealing with the
[22:26] crucifixion of christ and here we come
[22:29] the chapter 19 verse 41
[22:31] now in the place where he was crucified
[22:34] there was a garden
[22:35] it's amazing how often this pops up
[22:38] and the place where he was crucified
[22:40] there was a garden and in the garden of
[22:42] new sepulcher wherein was never a man
[22:44] yet laid and there laid they jesus
[22:46] therefore because of the jews
[22:48] preparation day for the sepulcher was
[22:50] nigh at hand
[22:52] so jesus the body of christ was planted
[22:55] in a garden
[22:56] amen
[22:58] let's go to chapter 20 verse 11.
[23:01] we know this is resurrection mourning
[23:03] now but mary stood without the sepulcher
[23:06] weeping and as she wept she stooped down
[23:08] and looked into the sepulchre and seeth
[23:10] two angels in white sitting the one at
[23:12] the head and the other at the feet where
[23:14] the body of jesus had lain and they say
[23:16] unto her woman why weep us down she
[23:19] saith unto them because they have taken
[23:21] away my lord and i know not where they
[23:23] have laid him and when she when she had
[23:26] thus said she turned herself back and
[23:28] saw jesus standing and knew not that it
[23:31] was jesus
[23:32] and and jesus saith unto her woman why
[23:35] weepest thou whom seekest thou
[23:37] she supposing him to be
[23:40] the gardener
[23:41] amen
[23:43] she's supposing him to be the gardener
[23:47] sayeth unto him sir if thou have borne
[23:49] him hence tell me where thou has laid
[23:51] him and i will take him away jesus saith
[23:54] unto her mary she turned herself and
[23:57] saith in him rabboni which is to say
[23:59] master.
[24:00] so here we find on the on the day of the
[24:02] crucifixion amen they took jesus and uh
[24:06] the body of christ and they laid him in
[24:08] a garden tomb they buried him in the
[24:10] garden amen and we know within three
[24:13] days that he resurrected and and so that
[24:16] seed came forth in life and he
[24:18] resurrected and now we know that he
[24:21] appeared a few times in different forms
[24:24] unto those we know that he appeared in a
[24:26] different form to those who were walking
[24:28] on the road to emmaus but here he
[24:29] appears to mary in a form and he's
[24:31] speaking to mary and mary doesn't
[24:33] recognize him and
[24:35] and mary knew what jesus looked like
[24:38] there's no question that she knew his
[24:40] face she knew what he looked like amen
[24:42] but he appears to her in a form and she
[24:44] doesn't recognize him in this form but
[24:47] she assumes he's the gardener and you
[24:49] wonder why did she assume he's the
[24:51] gardener that he had gardening tools did
[24:53] he have a gardening garb i don't know
[24:55] but she assumed him to be the gardener
[24:57] amen showing that jesus christ was
[24:59] buried as the seed but he raised as the
[25:02] gardener because god is the great
[25:03] gardener amen now he's not just the seed
[25:06] but he he's proving i'm not just a seed
[25:08] but i'm the gardener amen i'm the one
[25:11] amen i'm the one who planted the garden
[25:13] eastward in eden amen not just the seed
[25:16] that was planted but i'm also the one
[25:18] planting the seed
[25:19] i mean these themes run all the way
[25:21] through the scripture amen you see even
[25:24] even when you look at the constellation
[25:26] you know brother branham says that god
[25:28] wrote his first bible in the stars and
[25:30] if you look at the constellation of
[25:32] virgo which is the virgin amen the
[25:34] ancients would draw a depiction they
[25:36] would draw a picture amen and the stars
[25:39] don't actually make that picture
[25:41] you can't have you ever looked at the
[25:43] stars and you'd be like that's what now
[25:45] i
[25:46] because the stars don't actually make
[25:47] that picture but when the ancients would
[25:49] draw in a star diagram they would draw a
[25:51] picture and there would be key stars
[25:53] within that constellation and the names
[25:56] of the stars would tell the story of the
[25:57] constellation amen so in the in the
[26:00] constellation of virgo amen they draw a
[26:03] woman and then she's she's either
[26:05] standing or she's seated amen and they
[26:07] draw the ancient greeks drew a woman
[26:10] that was was holding in her hand a sheaf
[26:13] of wheat
[26:14] and and the name of the star that's in
[26:17] her hand in the constellation is the
[26:19] brightest star in the constellation it's
[26:20] one of the brightest stars in the night
[26:22] sky and the name of that star is spica
[26:25] and spica in latin means the head of
[26:28] grain
[26:29] amen
[26:31] so what did the woman have it was the
[26:33] seed of the woman amen it was
[26:36] what was christ amen the christ child
[26:38] was the seed of the woman that was
[26:39] promised all the way back in genesis
[26:42] chapter 3 at the time of the curse was
[26:44] promised there would come a seed of the
[26:46] woman so in virgo the virgin the
[26:48] brightest star that's in her hand amen
[26:51] is spica and in in in i think it's the
[26:54] egyptian show as a child sitting in her
[26:57] hand a baby sitting in her hand i mean
[26:59] the greeks show it as a sheaf of wheat
[27:01] the latin word spica means the head of
[27:03] grain he is the seed of the woman amen
[27:06] he is the planting he is the grain he
[27:08] had to die and be planted because amen
[27:11] if he if he abides amen he'll bite alone
[27:14] but if he be planting and die and go
[27:16] into the ground he'll come back many
[27:17] fold amen so the seed was planted so
[27:21] that he could come back a mini-membered
[27:23] body amen
[27:25] as his church as the bride of jesus
[27:26] christ so everything's telling the same
[27:28] story of gardening and planting and
[27:31] vineyards and wheat and barley and all
[27:34] this runs through the bible and as we
[27:36] look at the bible it's so easy to get
[27:38] caught up in the the black marks on
[27:40] white paper and the individual verses
[27:43] and the separated books and we can get
[27:45] down into the the details and mull
[27:47] around and miss the picture amen but
[27:50] sometimes god is so good to us that he
[27:52] allows us to catch these themes through
[27:54] the scripture and when you see the theme
[27:56] moving through you back off and you
[27:58] don't no longer look at the bible as 66
[28:01] separate books you don't look at it as a
[28:02] number of verses and a compilation of
[28:05] writings of men but you begin to see
[28:07] that this is a story this is a drama
[28:09] this is the unveiling of god it's the
[28:11] unfolding of his plan it's what was in
[28:14] his mind from before the foundation of
[28:16] the world and what he had in his mind
[28:18] was to plant his seed and his seed to
[28:20] produce multiple seed amen
[28:22] that's what god's been wanting to do all
[28:24] along
[28:26] praise be to god
[28:28] let's go to matthew chapter 13.
[28:35] we're going a long way to get to the
[28:36] subject title
[28:38] but praise god anyhow
[28:41] just keep smiling and nodding your head
[28:42] be nice to me and we'll
[28:45] keep pulling and we'll just trust god to
[28:47] bring us
[28:48] into the revelation that he has for us
[28:52] matthew 13 verse 24
[28:57] another parable put he forth unto them
[28:59] saying the kingdom of heaven is likened
[29:01] to a man which soweth good seed in this
[29:03] field
[29:05] but while men slept his enemy came and
[29:07] sowed tares among the wheat and went his
[29:09] way
[29:10] but when the blade was sprung up and
[29:12] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[29:14] tares also
[29:15] so the servants of the householder came
[29:17] and said unto him sir this thou not sow
[29:20] good seed in thy field
[29:21] from winston have it tears
[29:24] he said unto them an enemy hath done
[29:26] this the servant said unto him wilt thou
[29:29] then that we go and gather them up but
[29:31] he said nay lest while ye gather up the
[29:33] tares you root up also the wheat with
[29:36] them
[29:36] let both grow together until the harvest
[29:39] and in the time of harvest i will say to
[29:41] the reapers gather ye together first the
[29:44] tares and bind them in bundles to burn
[29:46] them but gather the wheat into my barn
[29:50] amen this word barn is also the word for
[29:52] garner which is also the word that this
[29:55] word barn can be is the same word that's
[29:57] translated threshing floor
[29:59] so bring the bring the bundles
[30:03] into
[30:04] the the threshing floor into the garner
[30:06] and the threshing floor is always the
[30:07] final stop before gathering into the
[30:10] garner because there's a final place of
[30:11] separation where the wheat is separated
[30:14] from the hull and the shuck and the dust
[30:15] and the stalk and all of that
[30:17] so so he begins to share this parable
[30:21] and the parable is about the kingdom of
[30:23] god but it shows the sowing of two seeds
[30:27] you catch that
[30:29] sowing of a seed first of wheat and a
[30:32] proper grain then sowing another seed of
[30:34] tares of weeds and then they must grow
[30:37] together all the way through down
[30:39] through time but in the time of harvest
[30:41] there'll be a separation
[30:43] so now let's go over and look at the
[30:45] explanation he gives of this in verse 36
[30:49] then jesus sent the multitude away and
[30:51] went into the house and his disciples
[30:53] came unto him saying declare unto us the
[30:55] parable of the tares of the field
[30:58] he answered and said unto them he that
[31:00] soweth the good seed is the son of man
[31:03] so now we're going to see that the son
[31:07] of man is a farmer
[31:09] he's a gardener
[31:10] he's the husbandman
[31:13] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[31:15] of man
[31:16] the field is the world the good seed are
[31:19] the children of the kingdom
[31:22] but the tares are the children of the
[31:24] wicked one
[31:26] right here jesus is explaining the
[31:29] condition of the world going all the way
[31:31] back to eden when two seeds were sown
[31:33] one was sown by the son of man one was
[31:36] sown by the wicked one
[31:38] and then there was going to be the the
[31:40] the grain the seed the wheat the the
[31:43] genuine that god wanted but mingled in
[31:46] amongst it was sowed of the wicked one
[31:48] other seed that he would call tares and
[31:51] they would be mingled together until the
[31:52] end time but in the end time they would
[31:54] be separated out
[31:56] and he said
[31:57] the tares are the children of the wicked
[31:59] one verse 39 the enemy that sowed them
[32:02] is the devil
[32:03] the harvest is the end of the world and
[32:05] the reapers are the angels
[32:07] as therefore the tares are gathered and
[32:09] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[32:12] end of this world the son of man shall
[32:14] send forth his angels and they shall
[32:16] gather out of his kingdom all things
[32:18] that offend in them which do iniquity
[32:21] and shall cast them into a furnace of
[32:23] fire there shall be wailing and gnashing
[32:25] of teeth then shall the righteous shine
[32:28] forth as the son and the kingdom of
[32:30] their father who hath ears to hear let
[32:33] him hear
[32:34] so this is one of the parables of the
[32:36] kingdom
[32:37] the kingdom of god and revealing one of
[32:39] the mysteries of the kingdom of god and
[32:41] that mystery is that the son of man
[32:42] sowed a seed and the wicked one sowed a
[32:44] seed
[32:46] and they mingled together and could not
[32:48] be separated until the end time but the
[32:50] end time he was going to send his angels
[32:52] and angels just mean messenger so don't
[32:54] don't don't look at this the wrong way
[32:56] he sent seven messengers to seven church
[32:58] ages
[32:59] and he's been separating out amen and
[33:02] they're going to be bound in the end
[33:03] time and burnt in fire there's going to
[33:06] come a final separation so part of the
[33:09] process of sowing seed amen comes to the
[33:12] harvest time and the harvest time is a
[33:15] time of separation
[33:17] amen things can get mingled weeds can
[33:19] come in uh
[33:21] the wrong seed can be sown in the field
[33:23] but it's left until the end time and in
[33:25] the end time amen there's going to be a
[33:28] separation because when he sowed the
[33:30] seed what he wanted was grain
[33:33] and he's going to have what he wanted
[33:35] because god is a husbandman god is a
[33:37] farmer god is a gardener
[33:40] amen
[33:42] so the the the part that i want to look
[33:44] at today is the part of separation and
[33:47] and he says
[33:49] uh
[33:50] he says
[33:51] that
[33:52] they'll send angels and they'll bind up
[33:54] the tares so in the time of of of the
[33:56] harvesting of the wheat amen they will
[33:59] the the the reapers who are harvesting
[34:01] the wheat they will be bundling the
[34:03] wheat together in sheaves to take to the
[34:05] threshing floor but they will also be
[34:07] gathering the tears in the wheat and
[34:09] binding them together and setting them
[34:11] aside for burning so there's a
[34:12] separation that takes place in the field
[34:15] but there's a further separation that
[34:17] takes place on the threshing floor and
[34:20] so on the threshing floor now the wheat
[34:22] plant comes into the threshing floor
[34:25] without the tares
[34:27] and in the threshing floor amen there's
[34:29] more separation so there's a separation
[34:32] in the field amen and then there's a
[34:34] separation at the threshing floor now
[34:36] remember
[34:38] that they were separate to start with
[34:41] when the son of man sowed the children
[34:43] of the kingdom into the world amen they
[34:45] were already separate from the tares
[34:47] they were already separate from the
[34:48] world they were already separated out so
[34:51] when we go through this process all it
[34:53] is is god taking back what was his
[34:55] originally amen god bringing it back to
[34:58] original condition originally it was
[35:00] separated originally it was seed it was
[35:03] wheat it was pure it was undefiled it
[35:06] wasn't mingled with anything it didn't
[35:07] have any of the world attached to it
[35:09] amen it was pure seed then it comes into
[35:12] the world to go through a growing
[35:14] process and through the growing process
[35:16] there's a mingling there's an attachment
[35:17] with the world there's all of these
[35:19] things that take place but the harvest
[35:21] time is going to be a time of separation
[35:24] separating the tares and the wheat in
[35:25] the field but then a further separation
[35:28] on the threshing floor so that when he
[35:30] gathers back into his garner he has
[35:32] again just his wheat
[35:36] just his children just his seed
[35:40] praise god
[35:41] amen so we we look at these things and
[35:45] it seems like a harsh process when you
[35:47] look at separation uh in the field and
[35:50] burning and thrashing and and all of
[35:52] these things but when you when you get
[35:54] down to the end of it it's a perfectly
[35:57] righteous act amen because he's taking
[35:59] back what was his originally the tares
[36:01] weren't his amen
[36:04] they were never his
[36:07] amen what does he want he wants his seed
[36:10] back
[36:11] he wants the seed that he intended that
[36:13] went through the growing process and
[36:15] after it's grown and developed and went
[36:17] through the stages of growth he's
[36:18] bringing it back into his garner he
[36:21] wants his seed back
[36:23] so this
[36:24] this
[36:25] uh there's a scripture another scripture
[36:27] i want to get to here
[36:29] let me find it
[36:38] i might just reference it
[36:40] if i can't find it yeah i'll just
[36:42] reference it i might come across it
[36:44] later but you know where uh no here it
[36:47] is i'm sorry
[36:49] uh let's go to matthew chapter 9.
[37:01] matthew chapter 9
[37:04] verse 37.
[37:10] he says then saith he unto his disciples
[37:13] the harvest is truly plenteous but the
[37:16] laborers are few
[37:18] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[37:20] harvest that he shall send forth
[37:21] laborers into his harvest
[37:24] jesus was looking out all the people and
[37:26] he and he saw the people scattered as
[37:28] sheep with no shepherd and he had
[37:30] compassion on them and he says and to
[37:32] his disciples
[37:34] the harvest truly is plenteous but the
[37:36] laborers are few pray to the lord of the
[37:39] harvest and he was the lord of the
[37:41] harvest
[37:42] he was the one declaring it was ready to
[37:44] reap he was the lord of the harvest so
[37:46] we know that he is the the gardener
[37:51] he is the seed sower because the one
[37:53] that sowed the seed was the son of man
[37:55] he's the lord of the harvest
[37:58] amen
[37:59] he's the head of the reapers
[38:01] he's all of these things and it's all
[38:04] about grain
[38:06] it's all about seed
[38:08] and he says pray therefore the lord of
[38:10] the harvest that he will send laborers
[38:11] into the harvest amen because there's
[38:13] got to be laborers that go in to pull
[38:15] out the wheat amen to separate out the
[38:18] wheat and that's what's been going on
[38:19] for 2 000 years amen and still we pray
[38:22] going on today that there's seed out
[38:24] there to be gathered amen to be brought
[38:26] out
[38:27] and let's go back to matthew chapter 3
[38:29] now
[38:32] so we talked about the separation in the
[38:34] field of the wheat and the tares and now
[38:37] we want to look at something john the
[38:38] baptist said
[38:40] uh matthew chapter 3 verse 11
[38:44] said i indeed baptize you with water
[38:46] unto repentance but he that cometh after
[38:48] me is mightier than i whose shoes i am
[38:50] not worthy to bear he shall baptize you
[38:53] with the holy ghost
[38:54] and with fire
[38:56] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[38:58] thoroughly purge his floor and gather
[39:01] his wheat into the garner but he will
[39:03] burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
[39:07] so he's talking about the one who's
[39:09] mightier than i so he's speaking of
[39:11] jesus christ
[39:13] he's going to have a baptism of fire but
[39:15] then he describes him this way his fan
[39:18] is in his hand
[39:19] and he will thoroughly purge his floor
[39:22] this word floor is the threshing floor
[39:24] he will thoroughly purge his floor so
[39:27] when it says his fan is in his hand it's
[39:29] not and we talked about this several
[39:31] years ago when we preached on it it's
[39:33] not a fan like we think of a fan but
[39:35] this fan is a winnowing fork and a
[39:37] winnowing fork is is an instrument as a
[39:40] tool amen they use at the harvest time
[39:42] the winnowing fork it would be almost
[39:44] like a rake for us only it works and
[39:47] backwards instead of raking something to
[39:49] you you put the winnowing forks
[39:51] underneath amen the the straw and the
[39:53] shaft and everything that's together and
[39:55] you throw it up in the air and as you
[39:58] throw it up in the air amen the wind
[40:00] blows away the chaff and the dust and
[40:02] all these things and the and the seed
[40:05] falls back upon the threshing floor amen
[40:08] and throughout this process
[40:10] of separating amen the shaft and the
[40:13] stalk and the dirt and all of these
[40:15] things from the wheat amen there's
[40:17] several things that they do they can
[40:19] flail the wheat i mean they have a stick
[40:21] with a piece of leather with a second
[40:23] stick they can beat it so there's
[40:25] beating so they take the sheaves where
[40:27] the end of the head of the sheath with
[40:29] the straw and the shuck and all of that
[40:32] comes out of the field they lay it down
[40:33] they beat it they trodden over it with
[40:36] ox amen they pull a sledge over it amen
[40:39] which is a as a wooden sledge that
[40:41] people ride on to to tear apart amen and
[40:44] separate the grain from the shuck and
[40:46] and the stalk then they and they they
[40:48] have oxen walk on it they have people
[40:50] walk on it they all kind it's trodden
[40:53] upon it's beaten amen it's torn us
[40:56] underne
[40:58] and then they come with the winnowing
[41:00] fork when the wind is blowing and they
[41:02] the fan is the winnowing fork and this
[41:04] fan is in his hand and he grabs a clump
[41:06] up and he tosses it up in the air amen
[41:09] and it gets tossed all about amen but
[41:11] the winds the winds that are blowing are
[41:13] moving away everything that's not seed
[41:16] amen but the seed remains on the
[41:18] threshing floor
[41:19] so everything gets tossed about amen and
[41:21] you wonder you know why why seemingly is
[41:25] it that i go through the same things the
[41:27] the unbeliever goes through i go through
[41:29] the same things the rest of the world i
[41:31] get sicknesses my car breaks down i have
[41:34] issues i
[41:36] i lost my job i did this i did that amen
[41:39] because you've got to go through through
[41:41] the winnowing process through the
[41:43] through the threshing process amen but
[41:46] what god is doing through the threshing
[41:48] process is he's getting the wheat amen
[41:51] separated from everything that's not
[41:54] life-carrying seed
[41:56] everything that's not original word
[41:59] original seed the original thought of
[42:01] god the original planting when he
[42:03] planted it first amen everything that's
[42:06] not original has to be separated off of
[42:08] this seed before he can gather it into
[42:11] his barn amen so the process is brutal
[42:14] the process is grueling amen the chaff
[42:17] gets tossed with the wheat the wheat
[42:19] gets trodden with the stalk amen they're
[42:21] all going through the same process amen
[42:23] but this process moves away stock it
[42:27] moves away chaff it moves away dust but
[42:30] it never blows away the seed amen that
[42:33] never moves god's original thought not
[42:36] god's original word god's original
[42:38] intent will always fall back on the
[42:40] threshing floor again
[42:43] so he will thoroughly purge his floor
[42:46] that means everything that is not
[42:49] original word from the original thought
[42:51] of god the original seed of god is being
[42:54] purged off of his threshing floor
[42:59] see the separation in the field is a
[43:01] separation
[43:04] and it couldn't happen until harvest
[43:05] time because it was so intertwined that
[43:08] when you pluck up one you can pluck up
[43:09] the other before it's come to maturity
[43:12] but we're not in that stage of greenness
[43:15] now because we've come through the
[43:16] church ages and come to maturity where
[43:18] there's been a separation and the
[43:20] separation in the field continues but
[43:23] he's bringing that that's been separated
[43:25] in the field back to his threshing floor
[43:28] so that he can finish the process of
[43:30] separating everything off of us that is
[43:33] not his original idea
[43:37] and so chaff gets tossed you get tossed
[43:42] amen stalk gets tossed you get to and
[43:44] who's doing the tossing the lord of the
[43:46] harvest
[43:47] [Music]
[43:50] who who's throwing you in the air the
[43:52] lord of the harvest
[43:55] but he's trying
[43:57] to separate us
[43:59] from everything that's not the original
[44:01] life
[44:04] and so
[44:07] the process
[44:08] was for ordained of god
[44:10] he sowed the seed into the earth he knew
[44:13] it would go through the process
[44:15] the the the false seed was sown in
[44:18] amongst it the separation time has to
[44:21] come we're now in the end time the
[44:23] harvest time
[44:25] now the final separation is taking place
[44:28] where where this bride is being
[44:30] separated from everything
[44:34] that's not the word
[44:37] and
[44:38] i don't know what we expected but if we
[44:40] read the scriptures we would know what
[44:42] to expect
[44:44] we shouldn't expect it to be easy we
[44:46] shouldn't expect it to be simple amen
[44:48] the process that is explained to us in
[44:50] the scriptures amen is not a process
[44:52] that's simple or easy it's a process
[44:55] that's complicated and difficult and
[44:57] rough and tumultuous but at the end and
[45:00] i'll say
[45:01] like i've taught this before but every
[45:03] time it's tossed and trodden upon and
[45:05] tossed and trodden upon and flailed and
[45:08] all the things that the the harvest goes
[45:10] through every time it's tossed about and
[45:12] trodden again every cycle changes the
[45:16] concentration of seed with non-seed
[45:20] so when they first come into the
[45:21] threshing floor you have a lot more
[45:24] material that's not the seed than is the
[45:26] seed
[45:27] so the concentration of the seed amen is
[45:30] minimal in comparison to the volume
[45:33] that's on the threshing floor there's
[45:34] piles of sheaves all over the threshing
[45:37] floor but only a very small volume of
[45:39] that is seed it could be piled up to
[45:42] where the oxen is trotting upon it i
[45:44] mean it's going knee-deep with in in all
[45:46] of this uh material amen but as the
[45:49] process goes on more and more material
[45:52] is removed purged from the threshing
[45:54] floor amen but the one thing that's
[45:56] never perched on the threshing floor is
[45:58] the seed
[46:00] so it's purged away and purged away and
[46:02] purged away and through each cycle of
[46:04] purging through each cycle of
[46:06] tribulation through each cycle of
[46:08] troubles and testings amen there's
[46:11] there's more there's a greater
[46:13] concentration of original seed to that
[46:16] which is not original seed
[46:19] so why why is uh why do we keep having
[46:22] one trial after another trial after
[46:24] another trial amen because god wants to
[46:26] change the concentration in you amen he
[46:29] wants to get back to that original word
[46:32] a son of god in every way taking only
[46:35] the word not your ideas not the ideas of
[46:38] man not the concepts of laodicea but
[46:41] he's tossing us about and grinding us
[46:43] under to separate us from those things
[46:46] because he wants the concentration to
[46:48] come back to just word and word only
[46:51] just original and original only
[46:55] so it's not this this process is spelled
[46:58] out in the scriptures it's plain
[47:01] and we can see it in our lives
[47:04] and so we thank god for that
[47:06] it this these things that we go through
[47:08] it now this changes our perspective when
[47:11] we understand the word and what god is
[47:13] doing the parable of the kingdom all the
[47:15] sudden and unlocks so much and we
[47:18] understand now what my life is all about
[47:20] amen and we stop asking the questions of
[47:23] why is this happening to me and we start
[47:26] saying god what do you want me to do and
[47:29] how do you want me to act and what is it
[47:30] you're showing me amen
[47:33] no more why is this happening to me and
[47:34] this isn't fair and all of this nonsense
[47:37] that happened in our immaturity and our
[47:39] childish faith amen that should be going
[47:41] away amen because we're on the threshing
[47:43] floor being separated from the world
[47:45] carnality carnal ideas worldly thinking
[47:49] amen churchianity and denominational
[47:51] understanding is being pulled away from
[47:53] us and bringing us right back to the
[47:55] original thought of god
[47:58] we say thank god
[47:59] amen this process may be difficult but
[48:02] it's good amen
[48:03] this process may be inconvenient for my
[48:05] flesh but god is not after my flesh he's
[48:08] after my soul amen
[48:10] because that's where the seed is
[48:12] praise be to god
[48:14] he's got a solution for the flesh
[48:17] so i want to go back and look in the old
[48:18] testament a little bit if you can turn
[48:20] with me to first samuel
[48:23] and i want to take a little bit a look
[48:25] at the ark of the covenant and the
[48:27] threshing floor
[48:29] for just a few minutes
[48:32] because i really want to establish this
[48:34] principle through the scripture
[48:38] first samuel
[48:39] see if i can get there uh chapter six
[48:41] first samuel chapter six
[48:51] in verse 10.
[48:55] when we come to verse 10
[48:57] we back up a little bit and know that
[49:00] uh that in the days of eli the high
[49:04] priest who was judge of israel the ark
[49:06] of the covenant was lost and it went to
[49:08] the philistines but it was too much for
[49:10] the philistines to handle they couldn't
[49:11] handle it amen they were having a lot of
[49:14] problems so they sent they were going to
[49:15] send the ark away from them so they they
[49:18] this is their plan to send it away they
[49:20] were going to get two uh milk cows that
[49:22] had young calves they were going to hold
[49:24] back the calves send it on a cart amen
[49:26] with gifts and send it away from them
[49:29] with the milk cows then the milk cows
[49:30] will always turn back to their calves
[49:32] because there's nobody to drive it they
[49:34] just sent it away and they said if it
[49:35] goes straight away and goes to israel
[49:38] then it was god bringing this plague
[49:40] upon us but if it turns back then it
[49:41] wasn't gone so they get the milk cows
[49:43] we're going to pick this up in verse 10
[49:45] and the men did so and took two milk
[49:47] kind and tied them to the cart and shut
[49:50] up their calves at home and they laid
[49:52] the ark of the lord upon the cart and
[49:54] the coffer with the mice of gold and
[49:56] with the images of their emirates and
[49:58] the kind took the straight way to the
[50:00] way of beth shemesh it went straight
[50:03] they didn't turn to the side they didn't
[50:05] turn back home back to their cavs amen
[50:07] they went straight into israel straight
[50:10] to the to the uh
[50:11] israeli territory
[50:13] straight to the way to beth shemesh and
[50:15] went along the highway lowing as they
[50:17] went and turned not aside to the right
[50:19] hand or to the left and the lords of the
[50:21] philistines went after them into the
[50:23] border of beth
[50:24] shemesh and they of beth shemesh were
[50:28] reaping their wheat harvest in the
[50:30] valley
[50:31] i don't believe anything is by accident
[50:33] in the bible
[50:35] so now
[50:36] they have lost the word amen because the
[50:39] ark represented the word because the ten
[50:41] commandments the original ten
[50:43] commandments were in the ark amen and it
[50:45] represented the word which represented
[50:47] the presence of god when the ark left
[50:49] with the original covenant the presence
[50:51] of god left from israel amen but when
[50:54] the ark with the original covenant the
[50:56] original word came back in it was a
[50:58] return of the presence of the lord
[51:01] and so now the the word is coming back
[51:04] the presence of the lord the ark is
[51:06] coming back when at the time of wheat
[51:09] harvest
[51:11] amen at the time of wheat harvest so let
[51:14] me see read this again
[51:16] and they of beth shemesh verse 13 were
[51:19] reaping their wheat harvest in the
[51:21] valley and they lifted up their eyes and
[51:23] saw the ark and rejoiced to see it and
[51:25] the cart came into the field of joshua
[51:28] joshua was the old testament name for
[51:30] jesus jesus and joshua the same name
[51:32] so it came into the field of jesus
[51:35] joshua
[51:36] amen
[51:38] a beth shemite
[51:39] and beth beth shemesh means the house of
[51:42] son of the son
[51:45] the house of the son and stood there
[51:47] where there was a great stone and they
[51:49] claimed the wood of the cart and offered
[51:50] the kind and burnt offering unto the
[51:52] lord so here we see the philistines
[51:55] couldn't handle the word amen the
[51:56] presence of the lord was judgment upon
[51:59] them amen so the ark represented the
[52:02] presence of the lord because of the
[52:03] original word the original covenant they
[52:05] could not handle the presence of the
[52:07] lord the presence of the lord was
[52:08] judging them
[52:11] so they could not bear under the
[52:13] judgments they were breaking out and
[52:14] tumors and cancers and having all kinds
[52:16] of problems so they sent it away and in
[52:19] a supernatural way those milk kind they
[52:22] took them they took it right to israel
[52:24] but it come right at the time they were
[52:27] in the fields reaping the wheat harvest
[52:29] amen because at the time of wheat
[52:32] harvest which is the reaping of the
[52:33] gentiles amen the word is going to
[52:36] return into the land and with the word
[52:38] will come the presence of the lord and
[52:39] that's the day we live in
[52:43] it comes through the field of joshua
[52:46] in the house of the son
[52:48] praise be to god
[52:50] this is our day
[52:53] so let's move on
[52:54] then the the we know that in besha mesh
[52:57] they sin greatly against god that they
[52:59] looked into the ark and when they looked
[53:00] into the ark a plague broke out and
[53:02] killed many of them so they sent it away
[53:04] to another city which was a levite town
[53:06] and they put it under the care of
[53:07] levites and there it remained for 20
[53:10] years until david would call it home to
[53:12] himself now when david took the kingdom
[53:15] when he took jerusalem amen he was he
[53:17] pitched a tent for the house of the lord
[53:19] and the city of david and he wants now
[53:21] the ark to come to him because david
[53:23] wants the presence of the lord with him
[53:25] in jerusalem
[53:27] david wants the covenant he wants the
[53:29] ark amen amen the philistines couldn't
[53:31] handle it it judged them he sent it away
[53:33] david wants it to come to him
[53:37] amen
[53:38] so david amen let's go let's look at
[53:41] this in second samuel let's just flip
[53:43] over here just a second samuel chapter
[53:45] six
[53:46] and we'll read it together
[53:48] so david sends a company after it they
[53:51] put it upon a
[53:52] new cart a new ox cart mean which we
[53:55] know is not the correct way it was
[53:56] supposed to be bore on the shoulders of
[53:58] the levites amens but but david is
[54:00] bringing it back with rejoicing they're
[54:02] excited the presence of the lord is
[54:04] coming back amen but they're not doing
[54:06] it according to the word they're doing
[54:08] according to their own understanding
[54:10] and then in second samuel 6 verse 6
[54:14] and when they came
[54:15] to naked's threshing floor
[54:19] i want you to catch this
[54:21] the bible lists a very specific place
[54:23] that they came to when they were
[54:25] bringing it up amen from the city of the
[54:28] levites they were bringing it into the
[54:30] city of david and as they got to a very
[54:33] specific place along the journey
[54:36] when they got to this place which is
[54:40] naked's threshing floor ouza put forth
[54:42] his hand to the ark of god and took hold
[54:44] of it for the ox and shook it
[54:48] and this this word shook it means to
[54:50] fall or to fall over it was going to
[54:52] fall off of the cart and he reached up
[54:55] and he grabbed a hold of it where did
[54:57] god allow this to happen at a threshing
[54:59] floor
[55:01] and at the threshing floor
[55:03] amen
[55:05] the
[55:06] the
[55:07] ooze put forth his hand to the ark of
[55:09] god and took hold of it for the ox and
[55:11] shook him and the anger of the lord was
[55:12] kindled against us and god smote him
[55:15] there for his error and there he died by
[55:18] the ark of god
[55:19] amen he he was smitten dead amen where
[55:23] at the threshing floor not anywhere else
[55:25] along that journey not when they put it
[55:28] up on the on the ox card amen not as
[55:30] they come along amen but at at the
[55:34] threshing floor the auction shook amen
[55:36] it was going to spill over there at the
[55:39] threshing floor amen user was judged
[55:42] because he touched the ark amen and it
[55:44] was a judgment of god at the threshing
[55:46] floor because they were not doing it
[55:48] according to the word because everything
[55:50] must come back to the word amen not our
[55:53] ideas amen and it just shows the
[55:56] threshing floor is the place of
[55:57] separation and the place of separation
[56:00] is a place of judgment in the judgment
[56:02] place it's separated what is wheat and
[56:04] what is not wheat
[56:06] right so the threshing floor is a place
[56:09] of judgment
[56:11] and in that place of judgment the the
[56:13] wheat in everything that's not original
[56:15] wheat grain is separated out and here at
[56:19] the threshing floor the judgment of god
[56:21] strikes
[56:22] because it's a threshing floor
[56:26] these these things
[56:28] these aren't cute stories
[56:32] they're not interesting things they're a
[56:34] theme that god is laying down
[56:37] let's look at second samuel 24.
[56:42] we know that david eventually
[56:44] uh learns of his mistake his error he
[56:47] sends the levites they buried on the
[56:49] shoulders they bring it into the
[56:50] tabernacle that he pitched in the city
[56:52] of david um
[56:55] and so it go it goes thus far then we
[56:58] come to uh ii samuel 24 and i want to
[57:02] read verse 1
[57:05] and again the anger of the lord was
[57:07] kindled against israel and he moved
[57:09] david against them to say go number
[57:11] israel and judah
[57:13] i want to spend a few minutes on this
[57:15] because it's very interesting to me
[57:17] the anger of the lord was kindled
[57:19] against israel israel had done something
[57:21] wrong and god was going to bring a
[57:22] judgment to them
[57:24] and it says that he moved david against
[57:27] him to say go number israel and judah
[57:30] but james 1 13 i'll just read you james
[57:33] 1 says let no man say when he is tempted
[57:35] i am tempted of god
[57:38] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[57:40] neither tempteth he any man but every
[57:42] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[57:44] his own lust and enticed then when lust
[57:47] hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and
[57:49] sin when it is finished bringeth forth
[57:51] death so james says let no man say when
[57:53] he's tempted i'm tempted of gone for god
[57:56] cannot be tempted with evil neither
[57:58] tempteth thee any man
[58:00] but here
[58:01] in verse 1 it says the anger of the lord
[58:03] was kindled against israel and he moved
[58:05] david against them to say go number
[58:07] israel and judah so we get the rest of
[58:09] the story in first chronicles so let's
[58:12] go over the first chronicles
[58:14] and fill in
[58:16] the blanks
[58:19] first chronicles chapter 21
[58:28] first chronicles
[58:31] chapter 21
[58:33] verse 1
[58:35] and satan stood up against israel and
[58:38] provoked david to number israel
[58:43] how did god move david
[58:45] he let the devil loose on him
[58:48] all right
[58:49] listen friends
[58:51] satan is not taking over god's kingdom
[58:56] satan is working to bring about god's
[58:59] plan
[59:01] god was angry against israel and he
[59:03] moved david how did he move david he
[59:05] unleashed the devil against him and the
[59:07] devil tempted him amen and it says and
[59:10] satan stood up against israel and
[59:11] provoked david to number israel
[59:14] david now was told not to number amen
[59:17] they were not to number themselves
[59:18] because it didn't matter how many they
[59:20] were god fought for them god was on
[59:22] their side they didn't need strength in
[59:24] numbers they needed strength in god amen
[59:26] and so they were never to number
[59:28] themselves and then david sends to
[59:30] number and james tells us amen we're
[59:32] enticed when we're led late let away of
[59:35] our own lust there was something david
[59:37] wanted to know in this numbering of the
[59:39] people he wanted to know how many people
[59:41] how much strength how big his army
[59:43] whatever it was he wanted to know he was
[59:45] enticed by his own lusts
[59:48] and it was the devil that was doing it
[59:50] not god but god allowed it amen so satan
[59:53] is just a tool that god is using to work
[59:55] out his plan and bring perfection and
[59:57] understanding and teaching to his
[1:00:00] children amen
[1:00:03] so
[1:00:04] praise be to god
[1:00:06] sometimes we get so mad at the devil
[1:00:09] amen but they had done something to
[1:00:11] provoke god
[1:00:13] and they needed to look at themselves
[1:00:14] you know and say god help me
[1:00:17] first chronicles 21 8.
[1:00:19] go to verse 8.
[1:00:21] and god and david said unto god i have
[1:00:23] sinned greatly because i have done this
[1:00:25] thing but now i beseech thee do away the
[1:00:28] iniquity of thy servant for i have done
[1:00:30] very foolishly and the lord spake unto
[1:00:32] god david see are saying go and tell
[1:00:34] david saying thus saith the lord i offer
[1:00:37] thee three things choose thee one of
[1:00:39] them that i may do it unto thee
[1:00:42] so god came to david and said unto him
[1:00:44] thus saith the lord choose thee either
[1:00:46] three years famine or three months to be
[1:00:48] destroyed before thy foes while that the
[1:00:51] sword of thine enemy overtake thee or
[1:00:53] else three days the sword of the lord
[1:00:55] even the pestilence in the land and the
[1:00:57] angel of the lord
[1:01:00] and the angel of the lord destroying
[1:01:01] throughout all the coast of israel
[1:01:03] now therefore advise thyself
[1:01:06] that
[1:01:07] what word i shall bring again to him
[1:01:08] that sent me and david said unto god i
[1:01:11] am in a great strait let me fall now
[1:01:13] into the hand of the lord for very great
[1:01:16] are his mercies but let me not fall into
[1:01:18] the hand of man.
[1:01:20] so the lord sent pestilence upon israel
[1:01:22] and there fell of israel seventy
[1:01:24] thousand men
[1:01:26] and god sent an angel into jerusalem to
[1:01:28] destroy it
[1:01:29] and as he was destroying the lord beheld
[1:01:32] and he repented him of the evil and said
[1:01:34] to the angel that destroyed it is enough
[1:01:37] stay now thine hand and the angel of the
[1:01:40] lord stood by the threshing floor of
[1:01:42] ornan the jebusite
[1:01:45] here we have another threshing floor
[1:01:47] another seed of judgment another place
[1:01:49] of separation
[1:01:51] and as the angel of the lord was
[1:01:52] destroying through all the coast of
[1:01:54] israel when it comes to jerusalem and it
[1:01:57] comes to destroy in jerusalem god says
[1:01:59] stop because jerusalem is a type of the
[1:02:00] bride and god says stop and he repented
[1:02:03] himself of all his evil and he stopped
[1:02:06] and he says stay now thy hand and the
[1:02:08] angel of the lord stood by the threshing
[1:02:10] floor of ornon the jebusite listen he
[1:02:13] could have stood anywhere it's
[1:02:14] significant that god had him stop here
[1:02:19] verse 16 and david lifted up his eyes
[1:02:21] and saw the angel of the lord stand
[1:02:23] between the earth and the heaven having
[1:02:25] a drawn sword and his hand stretched out
[1:02:27] over jerusalem then david and the elders
[1:02:30] of israel who were clothed in sackcloth
[1:02:32] fell upon their faces and david said
[1:02:34] unto god is it not i that commandeth the
[1:02:37] people to be numbered even i it is that
[1:02:40] has sinned and done evil indeed but as
[1:02:42] for these sheep what have they done
[1:02:44] let thine hand i pray thee o lord my god
[1:02:47] be on me in my father's house but not on
[1:02:49] thy people that they should be plagued
[1:02:52] then the angel of the lord commanded gad
[1:02:54] to say to david that david should go up
[1:02:57] and set up an altar unto the lord and
[1:02:59] the threshing floor of ornan the
[1:03:01] jebusite and david went up at the saying
[1:03:04] of god which was spoken thy name of the
[1:03:07] lord and ornan turned back and saw the
[1:03:10] angel and his four sons with him hid
[1:03:12] themselves now ornan was threshing
[1:03:16] wheat
[1:03:18] what time was it
[1:03:20] in the wheat harvest
[1:03:22] and the time of the wheat harvest while
[1:03:24] he was threshing wheat
[1:03:26] god comes to jerusalem for the
[1:03:28] destruction and he tells the angel stop
[1:03:32] and his sword is stretched over
[1:03:33] jerusalem
[1:03:34] but he says stop
[1:03:37] not here
[1:03:38] not now
[1:03:40] god extends mercy in the harvest time
[1:03:44] during the wheat threshing time
[1:03:47] he extends mercy and he says stop
[1:03:50] by the threshing floor of ornan where
[1:03:53] ornon was threshing his wheat
[1:03:57] do you see the theme
[1:03:59] are you catching it
[1:04:01] amen
[1:04:03] and he says
[1:04:06] and david came to ornon
[1:04:08] ornon looked and saw david and went out
[1:04:10] of the threshing floor and bound himself
[1:04:11] to david with his face to the ground
[1:04:13] then david said to oron grant me the
[1:04:15] place of this threshing floor that i may
[1:04:17] build an altar thereon unto the lord
[1:04:19] thou shalt grant me for the full price
[1:04:21] that the plague may be stayed from the
[1:04:22] people
[1:04:23] and ornan said unto david take it to
[1:04:26] thee and let my lord the king do that
[1:04:28] which is good in his eyes lo i give thee
[1:04:30] the oxen also for burnt offering and the
[1:04:33] threshing instruments for wood and the
[1:04:34] wheat for the weed offering i give it
[1:04:36] all
[1:04:37] and king david said to ornan nay but i
[1:04:39] will verily buy it for the full price
[1:04:41] for i will not take that which is dying
[1:04:43] for the lord nor offer burnt offerings
[1:04:45] without cost so david gave to ornan
[1:04:49] for the place 600 shekels of gold by
[1:04:52] weight and david built there an altar
[1:04:54] into the lord and offered burnt offering
[1:04:56] and peace offering and called upon the
[1:04:58] lord and he answered him from heaven by
[1:05:01] fire upon the altar of burnt offering
[1:05:04] and the lord commanded the angel and he
[1:05:06] put up his sword again into the sheath
[1:05:08] thereof at the time when david saw the
[1:05:11] lord had answered him in the threshing
[1:05:12] floor of ornon the jebusite then he
[1:05:15] sacrificed there for the tabernacle of
[1:05:17] the lord which moses made in the
[1:05:19] wilderness and the altar of the burnt
[1:05:20] offering were at that season in the high
[1:05:22] place at gibeon and david could not go
[1:05:25] before it to inquire of god for he was
[1:05:27] afraid because of the sword of the angel
[1:05:29] of the lord
[1:05:30] chapter 22 verse 1 then david said this
[1:05:33] is the house of the lord god and this is
[1:05:35] the altar of the burnt offering for
[1:05:37] israel
[1:05:39] so now we see when he brings the ark up
[1:05:41] not according to the word amen uzza is
[1:05:44] smitten dead at a threshing floor amen
[1:05:46] now under another judgment for numbering
[1:05:49] the people amen the angel of the lord
[1:05:51] comes with a sword of pestilence
[1:05:53] throughout the coast amen any and
[1:05:55] they're dying amen there's a judgment
[1:05:57] there's a judgment time and it's a time
[1:05:59] of the wheat harvest during the
[1:06:01] threshing of wheat is also the time of
[1:06:03] the judgment amen and that's judgment
[1:06:05] goes so far but when he comes to
[1:06:08] jerusalem and the sort of stretch over
[1:06:10] jerusalem god says stop right there stop
[1:06:13] at the threshing floor of ornan
[1:06:17] stop this is the place of judgment but
[1:06:20] at the place of judgment is where god
[1:06:22] extended mercy at the threshing floor is
[1:06:25] where he stopped at the threshing floor
[1:06:27] he gave david an opportunity and david
[1:06:29] come at that spot and he offered a
[1:06:32] sacrifice unto the lord and the lord had
[1:06:34] the angel of the lord put his sword in
[1:06:35] his sheath and now you find mercy and
[1:06:38] judgment at the threshing floor
[1:06:41] it's a place of mercy and it's a place
[1:06:44] of judgment
[1:06:46] now let's look
[1:06:47] at second chronicles chapter 3.
[1:06:57] ii chronicles chapter 3
[1:06:59] verse 1.
[1:07:03] we know that david wanted to build a
[1:07:06] tabernacle
[1:07:07] a temple to the lord but he was not
[1:07:09] permitted but his son solomon was going
[1:07:11] to do it and verse chapter 3 verse 1
[1:07:13] says then solomon began to build the
[1:07:15] house of the lord
[1:07:17] at jerusalem in mount moriah
[1:07:20] where the lord appeared unto david his
[1:07:22] father in the place that david had
[1:07:24] prepared and the threshing floor of
[1:07:26] ornan the jebusite
[1:07:29] where was solomon's temple built
[1:07:32] on the threshing floor
[1:07:35] where was the ark placed on the
[1:07:36] threshing floor where was the temple of
[1:07:39] god on the threshing floor what was it
[1:07:42] it was a place of mercy and it was a
[1:07:44] place of judgment for the nation of
[1:07:46] israel amen it was a place of the mercy
[1:07:49] seat of god but the mercy seat of god
[1:07:51] with no blood covering was also the
[1:07:53] judgment seat of god it was the
[1:07:54] footstool of god the throne of god it
[1:07:56] was the place where which he would judge
[1:07:58] all of israel and where was it it was
[1:08:00] the same threshing floor
[1:08:03] and god offered unto them a place to
[1:08:05] find mercy and a way to find mercy in
[1:08:08] the threshing floor if they would come
[1:08:10] god's appointed way if they would come
[1:08:12] according to god's word amen the
[1:08:14] threshing floor became a mercy seat for
[1:08:17] all of israel
[1:08:20] if they stayed with god's word
[1:08:22] it also became a place of judgment
[1:08:25] if they left god's word
[1:08:27] where on the threshing floor
[1:08:30] and the time of wheat harvest
[1:08:34] we're in the time of wheat harvest
[1:08:37] we've come to the threshing floor
[1:08:39] this is the time of separation
[1:08:42] solomon come and he and he and he come
[1:08:45] to build this and he built it in moriah
[1:08:47] in mount moriah amen and mariah has
[1:08:49] mentioned what other place in the bible
[1:08:52] and it's mentioned back in genesis 22
[1:08:54] when god tests
[1:08:56] abraham and he tells abraham to take his
[1:08:59] son his only son unto moriah unto the
[1:09:03] mount that i should tell thee of and so
[1:09:05] abraham takes his son takes isaac the
[1:09:08] promised son the promise of god the word
[1:09:10] of god made manifest he takes his son
[1:09:13] and where is he going he's going right
[1:09:15] back to the same place amen where later
[1:09:18] would become a threshing floor would we
[1:09:20] be where the angel stopped the
[1:09:22] destruction of jerusalem will be where
[1:09:24] the temple was going to be built he goes
[1:09:26] to moriah to one of the mountains i
[1:09:28] should tell thee of and there he builds
[1:09:30] an altar and there he goes to sacrifice
[1:09:32] his son but right when he goes to
[1:09:34] sacrifice his son god extends mercy so
[1:09:37] that isaac doesn't have to die and he
[1:09:39] provides the substitutes
[1:09:43] and the ram caught in the thicket amen
[1:09:45] praise be to god he come he passed the
[1:09:48] test he could fulfill the word of god
[1:09:51] abraham was going to do all god said for
[1:09:53] him to do and he come to the place that
[1:09:56] would later be the threshing floor that
[1:09:57] would later be the temple that would be
[1:09:59] the testing ground and abraham passed
[1:10:02] the test by keeping the word of god and
[1:10:05] not withholding his son his only son
[1:10:08] from the lord
[1:10:11] praise god
[1:10:13] god is not
[1:10:14] asking us to give our sons
[1:10:18] but he's asking us to give the offspring
[1:10:21] of our desires
[1:10:23] he's asking us to give up the offspring
[1:10:25] of our thoughts
[1:10:27] of our minds
[1:10:29] so many times we have coming from our
[1:10:32] mind our own thoughts
[1:10:34] and we treasure that own thought
[1:10:37] we treasure that desire as a life like a
[1:10:41] child
[1:10:42] like our own offspring because it comes
[1:10:44] from us
[1:10:46] but praise god god is asking us to lay
[1:10:48] all that down on the altar
[1:10:50] to lose our own thinking to lose our own
[1:10:53] desires to lose our own production amen
[1:10:56] our own affection to lose it all amen
[1:10:59] and god amen will give us mercy at the
[1:11:02] judgment seat amen
[1:11:04] so we find moriah mentioned amen and
[1:11:07] that's where abraham called him jehovah
[1:11:09] jireh god who seeds the provider and it
[1:11:12] says in genesis 22 14 and abraham called
[1:11:16] the name of that place jehovah jireh as
[1:11:18] it is said to this day in the mount of
[1:11:20] the lord it shall be seen
[1:11:23] so this place became the mount of the
[1:11:24] lord which is the place where the
[1:11:26] tabernacle would or the temple would
[1:11:28] later sit solomon's temple amen and all
[1:11:31] the way back with abraham it was a place
[1:11:33] of judgment it was a place of testing
[1:11:36] it was a place of separation abraham
[1:11:39] separating from his own self from his
[1:11:41] own desire from his own will and just
[1:11:43] taking the word
[1:11:45] and god showed mercy
[1:11:48] at that altar
[1:11:50] let's go to first corinthians chapter
[1:11:52] nine
[1:11:54] this is where i wanna start bringing it
[1:11:56] home a little bit
[1:12:02] i hope that you don't mind my slow bible
[1:12:05] study approach
[1:12:06] but you can't blow through these things
[1:12:08] and catch what god's saying in the word
[1:12:13] and so many times we miss
[1:12:15] there's so much laying in the word of
[1:12:17] god that we just breeze over
[1:12:20] but it's so rich and it's so full we
[1:12:23] will never come to the end of
[1:12:24] discovering this bible while we're here
[1:12:26] on this earth
[1:12:29] first corinthians chapter 9
[1:12:31] verse 6.
[1:12:34] paul now speaking to the corinthians
[1:12:36] says are i only in barnabas have not we
[1:12:38] power to forbear working
[1:12:41] who go with the warfare any time at his
[1:12:43] own charges who planteth the vineyard
[1:12:45] and eateth not of the fruit thereof or
[1:12:47] who feedeth the flock and he does not of
[1:12:49] the milk of the flock he's talking about
[1:12:51] he and barnabas were working for their
[1:12:52] wages not taking the tithe of the people
[1:12:55] but he says don't we have a right to
[1:12:57] take the tithe of the people and look at
[1:12:59] what he says
[1:13:00] verse 9 for it is written in the law of
[1:13:02] moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of
[1:13:05] the ox that treadeth out the corn does
[1:13:07] god take care for oxen
[1:13:10] or
[1:13:11] saith thee it altogether for our sakes
[1:13:14] for our sakes no doubt this is written
[1:13:16] that he that plows should plow in hope
[1:13:18] and he that threshes in hope should he
[1:13:20] be partaker of his hope if we have sown
[1:13:23] unto you spiritual things it is a great
[1:13:25] thing if we shall reap your carnal
[1:13:28] things
[1:13:29] so this is not about tithing it's not
[1:13:31] about paying the preacher i just want to
[1:13:33] focus on verse 9.
[1:13:35] for it is written in the law of moses
[1:13:36] thou shall not muzzle the mouth of the
[1:13:39] ox that treadeth out the corn
[1:13:42] what is he talking about
[1:13:44] he's talking about threshing
[1:13:47] the ox treadeth the corn tramples upon
[1:13:49] it on the threshing floor
[1:13:52] and now the apostle paul
[1:13:54] is bringing his ministry to the church
[1:13:57] and his right to receive of their tithe
[1:14:01] and tying it into the act of threshing
[1:14:03] on the threshing floor and say didn't he
[1:14:05] even say don't muzzle the mocs as he
[1:14:08] talks as he treaded out the corn he even
[1:14:10] has a right to a portion of it as he's
[1:14:12] doing the work of threshing so what now
[1:14:15] is preaching
[1:14:17] what now is the preacher what now is the
[1:14:19] pastor he's the ox treading out the corn
[1:14:22] amen what is the what is what do we come
[1:14:24] to church for amen that i say this is a
[1:14:27] threshing floor amen let this be a
[1:14:30] threshing floor amen and let the
[1:14:31] minister come to the pulpit be the ox
[1:14:34] that's treading out the corn amen
[1:14:36] and and say god what what are we coming
[1:14:39] to church for i'm coming to be separated
[1:14:41] from carnality i'm coming to i'm coming
[1:14:44] to have exposed to me parts and
[1:14:47] particles of the world that are still
[1:14:48] sticking on i'm coming amen to be
[1:14:51] separated from everything that's not
[1:14:53] god's original thought of me
[1:14:56] and so the apostle paul attaches the the
[1:15:00] right to take offering in time with this
[1:15:02] this obscure scripture
[1:15:04] doesn't the ox even have a right don't
[1:15:06] muzzle the oxide treadeth out the corn
[1:15:08] and what's paul saying i'm treading your
[1:15:11] corn amen
[1:15:13] i'm laboring in the spiritual things i'm
[1:15:16] i'm i'm threshing out the wheat amen and
[1:15:19] he's showing that the ministers are
[1:15:20] right to protect because he's threshing
[1:15:22] out the wheat so what is church
[1:15:24] threshing out the wheat what is the
[1:15:26] minister the ox trotting upon the corn
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:32] praise be to god
[1:15:34] amen this will help us not to get
[1:15:36] offended
[1:15:38] when we get stepped upon
[1:15:41] now when we get stepped upon now listen
[1:15:43] this doesn't mean everything a preacher
[1:15:45] ever says is always right
[1:15:47] i mean we're human beings
[1:15:49] there's there's times that we can say
[1:15:51] something a little too far this way a
[1:15:53] little too far that way but that's why
[1:15:55] i'm so glad god made me a pastor and not
[1:15:57] an evangelist i got weeks to fix that
[1:15:59] thing
[1:16:01] say it too strong here i can come back
[1:16:02] and come over here and say it this way
[1:16:04] that's the mercies of god for me i don't
[1:16:06] have to qualify everything in one sermon
[1:16:10] so it's not as though everything the
[1:16:12] preacher said line it up with the word
[1:16:14] you have the message you know what's
[1:16:15] right and what's wrong
[1:16:17] it doesn't make the man behind the
[1:16:18] pulpit infallible but what's his job
[1:16:20] what's he doing he's treading out the
[1:16:22] corn
[1:16:24] now let's look at the treading out the
[1:16:25] corn and say next time you get stepped
[1:16:27] on don't say what is he saying say is am
[1:16:31] i being separated
[1:16:34] is there something clinging that needs
[1:16:36] to come off amen is there a thought an
[1:16:39] idea hey listen i i remember when i when
[1:16:42] i first really got serious with god and
[1:16:44] come to the message god started dealing
[1:16:46] with us and when you really give your
[1:16:48] heart to the lord he starts dealing with
[1:16:49] you and smoking and drinking and
[1:16:51] swearing and
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:55] and those there's a separation
[1:16:57] ungodly friends and associations there's
[1:16:59] a separation
[1:17:01] then you keep coming back to church and
[1:17:02] you keep getting trot upon
[1:17:05] you keep listening to the message
[1:17:06] reading your bible you keep getting trot
[1:17:08] upon and then he starts dealing with
[1:17:09] things that you look at and things that
[1:17:11] you listen to
[1:17:12] not so much your actions but what you're
[1:17:14] feeding on and then then you get trot on
[1:17:16] that gets separated and he keeps
[1:17:18] trotting upon you and trotting upon you
[1:17:21] until now god is dealing with the
[1:17:23] thoughts that are buried in your heart
[1:17:25] not what you speak and not what you do
[1:17:27] but what you think about a situation you
[1:17:30] come to church and god starts trotting
[1:17:32] upon
[1:17:33] your wrong thinking
[1:17:35] and nobody else knows you were thinking
[1:17:38] like that
[1:17:39] nobody else knows you were struggling
[1:17:41] with that that you had that bitterness
[1:17:42] or you had that uh that odd against the
[1:17:45] brother or you had that wrong idea
[1:17:47] nobody knows amen but the ox doesn't
[1:17:49] know anything the ox is just walking
[1:17:51] around
[1:17:53] it's not the ox it's the man driving the
[1:17:55] ox amen
[1:17:57] and he's like and what's he doing he's
[1:18:00] getting everything that's not original
[1:18:03] seed original life original child of god
[1:18:06] and he's separating it from us
[1:18:11] look at first peter let's look at first
[1:18:13] peter together
[1:18:18] i think it's so significant that the
[1:18:20] house of the lord was built on the
[1:18:21] threshing floor
[1:18:25] that god started by planting a garden
[1:18:28] that the parable of the kingdom is the
[1:18:30] son of man
[1:18:31] sowed seed which were children of the
[1:18:33] kingdom
[1:18:35] and an enemy sow but there'll be a
[1:18:36] harvest time and a separation
[1:18:39] and so god built the temple on a
[1:18:42] threshing floor
[1:18:44] god judged jesus at a threshing floor
[1:18:46] god brought the ark the presence of god
[1:18:48] back in at the time of the wheat harvest
[1:18:51] all of this is pointing to our day and
[1:18:53] god's purpose god is finishing his final
[1:18:56] act of gathering his seed in this day
[1:18:59] and he's finishing the threshing and the
[1:19:00] separating and bringing back pure seed
[1:19:03] this is the day that we live in
[1:19:07] first peter chapter 4.
[1:19:14] first peter chapter 4
[1:19:16] verse 16.
[1:19:19] yet if any man suffer as a christian let
[1:19:22] him not be ashamed but let him glorify
[1:19:24] god on this behalf for the time has come
[1:19:27] that judgment must begin at the house of
[1:19:30] god
[1:19:31] where does judgment begin the house of
[1:19:32] god where was the house of god been
[1:19:34] solomon's day at a threshing floor what
[1:19:36] happened at that threshing floor amen
[1:19:38] judgment was stayed when an offering was
[1:19:40] made
[1:19:42] and that's where
[1:19:43] the ark was set
[1:19:46] judgment
[1:19:49] judgment
[1:19:51] let me read this again
[1:19:55] verse 16. yet if any man suffer as a
[1:19:56] christian let him not should be ashamed
[1:19:58] i'm sorry
[1:20:00] what verse did i start with 16 17 for
[1:20:03] the time has come that judgment must
[1:20:05] begin at the house of god and if it
[1:20:08] first begin at us what shall the end be
[1:20:10] of them that obey not the gospel of god
[1:20:14] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:20:16] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[1:20:18] appear wherefore let them that suffer
[1:20:20] according to the will of god commit the
[1:20:22] keeping of their souls to him and
[1:20:24] well-doing as unto a faithful creator
[1:20:28] when judgment must begin where at the
[1:20:30] house of god
[1:20:31] what is the house of god it's not this
[1:20:33] building
[1:20:36] the house of god are these buildings
[1:20:39] this is his dwelling place this is the
[1:20:41] body of christ this is the tabernacle of
[1:20:43] god it means where the spirit of god
[1:20:45] dwells amen and judgment must begin at
[1:20:47] the house of god and the house of god is
[1:20:50] his people
[1:20:52] and you say why is it i can get away
[1:20:55] with nothing because judgment must begin
[1:20:57] at the house of god
[1:20:59] why is it every time i do something
[1:21:01] somebody preaches on it
[1:21:04] because judgment must begin at the house
[1:21:06] of god until we get to the place where
[1:21:08] we say thank you god amen i'm so
[1:21:10] thankful amen that you want me back in
[1:21:13] your garner amen you want me you'll take
[1:21:16] me through the threshing process you'll
[1:21:18] take me but it's the threshing floor is
[1:21:20] also a place of mercy
[1:21:23] it's not just a place of judgment it's a
[1:21:25] place of mercy
[1:21:26] because that's where he put his mercy
[1:21:28] seat
[1:21:30] in the message the indictment the
[1:21:32] prophet of god said and i want to kind
[1:21:34] of use it more like if it was like a
[1:21:36] room of a courtroom and after all the
[1:21:38] pulpit and the church is a courtroom
[1:21:41] it's a judgment seat that it must begin
[1:21:43] at the house of the lord
[1:21:45] we'll read through several several
[1:21:47] statements like this there's a little
[1:21:49] things that we do
[1:21:50] and that's what we come to church for is
[1:21:53] to find out where our faults is
[1:21:57] so if you only come to church to be told
[1:21:59] how wonderful you are
[1:22:01] you're the bride all the promises are
[1:22:03] yours god loves you so much everything's
[1:22:06] wonderful go home
[1:22:09] hey you know that's true all of those
[1:22:11] things are true and i want to hear them
[1:22:14] do you want to hear him i love when he
[1:22:16] whispers love secrets in our ears but
[1:22:18] there's something that we need along
[1:22:19] with that amen we need the encouragement
[1:22:21] but we also need the correction amen
[1:22:23] because we need separation
[1:22:27] and we
[1:22:29] that's why we come to church wars to
[1:22:30] find out where our fault is and the
[1:22:32] things that we might better ourselves by
[1:22:34] if we come to church for any other
[1:22:36] objective than this i'm afraid we won't
[1:22:38] get too much out of coming to church
[1:22:42] we must come to find our weaknesses find
[1:22:44] our bad places and see how little we are
[1:22:47] and put our trust in somebody that's
[1:22:49] stronger
[1:22:50] i say praise god for this i love this
[1:22:53] statement i love this quote
[1:22:55] and the message second-handed road he
[1:22:56] says well one day he went up there to
[1:22:58] the school of the prophets to visit them
[1:23:00] and they asked him to leave they said
[1:23:02] it's too straight around here for us
[1:23:04] what we need today is some more what we
[1:23:06] need today is some more straight gospel
[1:23:08] preaching that'll separate the wheat
[1:23:10] from the chaff or the right from the
[1:23:12] wrong
[1:23:14] and i say amen amen if it if if it rakes
[1:23:18] the height off of me i don't need my
[1:23:20] height anymore i'm getting a new body
[1:23:22] amen
[1:23:24] amen you know
[1:23:25] the the when the when the when the
[1:23:28] wheat comes to the threshing floor i
[1:23:31] mean sometimes that shuck is sticking
[1:23:33] pretty tight down at the base of that
[1:23:35] weed and it just needs some extra
[1:23:37] persuasion to cut loose
[1:23:39] it needs some extra pressure amen and
[1:23:41] the pressure was never intended to
[1:23:43] destroy the wheat because the wheat was
[1:23:45] the object all along
[1:23:47] the seed was the point of the story it
[1:23:49] was the point of the sowing it was the
[1:23:51] reason for the husbandman being in the
[1:23:52] field having a a fan in his hand having
[1:23:56] a threshing floor all of it is for the
[1:23:59] seed
[1:24:00] so none of this is to destroy the seed
[1:24:02] all of this is to bring the seed back
[1:24:05] into its proper condition
[1:24:08] so let it do the work it's supposed to
[1:24:10] do
[1:24:12] if it rakes hard let it rake hard
[1:24:13] because sometimes things stick really
[1:24:15] tight
[1:24:16] there are things in our lives that just
[1:24:18] stick really tight and the things that
[1:24:20] stick to tightest sometimes are our own
[1:24:23] ideas about things
[1:24:25] and our own affections our own lusts our
[1:24:28] own human desires things that we want
[1:24:30] out of life things that we want to
[1:24:32] accomplish things that we want to do
[1:24:35] things that we like amen and those are
[1:24:38] sometimes the things that stick tightest
[1:24:40] to us amen
[1:24:41] but god is bringing his word amen again
[1:24:44] and again and again and rolling us
[1:24:46] through the fleshing floor and tossing
[1:24:48] us because we've got to lose our own
[1:24:50] lust amen we've got to lose our own idea
[1:24:53] we've got to come to the place where we
[1:24:55] can surrender all and say it's not my
[1:24:58] will it's not my mind it's you god it's
[1:25:01] all you
[1:25:03] your word is right and i'm always wrong
[1:25:08] but you know sometimes you know the
[1:25:10] wheat's rolling around and may not
[1:25:11] realize this thing's still sticking
[1:25:16] sometimes we don't realize there's still
[1:25:17] things that gotta go
[1:25:20] if we've been serving god those of you
[1:25:22] who've been serving god any length of
[1:25:23] time you know what it's like to think
[1:25:26] all as well then all of a sudden god
[1:25:28] exposes something else
[1:25:31] and he exposes something
[1:25:33] deeper down than on the surface
[1:25:35] something that's below the surface
[1:25:38] because we can get everything on the
[1:25:39] surface to go right but sometimes things
[1:25:41] below the surface aren't right
[1:25:43] so the word word of god i've said before
[1:25:46] god is the best heart surgeon there ever
[1:25:49] was
[1:25:50] he can cut so deep nobody else can find
[1:25:53] it
[1:25:55] to remove what doesn't belong there
[1:25:58] and the mess message watchman one of the
[1:26:00] nine says oh
[1:26:02] god
[1:26:04] oh if they would rejoice when the
[1:26:06] harvest began what ought we do when the
[1:26:08] harvest is over
[1:26:10] winnowing time is here now separating
[1:26:12] the chaff this is the time then how can
[1:26:15] you hold your peace without blasting it
[1:26:17] out just exactly this is winnowing time
[1:26:20] yes sir when you beat the husk off the
[1:26:22] week that's exactly right
[1:26:24] this is the time for what beating the
[1:26:26] husk off the wheat
[1:26:29] what will beat the husk of the week not
[1:26:31] an arrogant nasty attitude
[1:26:35] i want you to think about this
[1:26:38] prophet of god said we need uh the
[1:26:40] gospel preached straight
[1:26:42] that'll separate the chaff and the wheat
[1:26:46] we need to beat the shaft off of the
[1:26:48] wheat
[1:26:50] but let's not get the wrong idea in my
[1:26:52] mind that we have to be harsh and nasty
[1:26:54] and
[1:26:57] forceful and
[1:26:59] hard-lined
[1:27:00] we don't have to have that attitude
[1:27:03] let's watch this in the scriptures
[1:27:05] watch it in the word
[1:27:09] see this is the messiest sign of his
[1:27:11] coming 1962 so then he said to the
[1:27:13] pharisees
[1:27:15] your generation of snakes who's warned
[1:27:16] you to flee from the wrath that's to
[1:27:18] come
[1:27:19] to stand out there he said i will
[1:27:20] thoroughly purge his floor
[1:27:22] he will gather up wheat into his garner
[1:27:25] he will sweep her clean and he will burn
[1:27:27] the chaff with unquenchable fire this is
[1:27:29] the
[1:27:29] uh john the baptist speaking john the
[1:27:31] baptist is giving this declaration amen
[1:27:34] his fan is in his hand he'll thoroughly
[1:27:36] purge his threshing floor he'll he'll
[1:27:38] burn the chaff with unquenchable fire
[1:27:41] so this is the uh john the baptist
[1:27:43] preaching
[1:27:44] and the axe is laid to the root of the
[1:27:46] tree oh my what a messiah coming but
[1:27:49] then when he got there little meek
[1:27:51] gentle fellow
[1:27:53] shoulder stooped down the bible said no
[1:27:55] beauty we should desire him man of
[1:27:56] sorrow acquainted with grief the bible
[1:28:00] said he wouldn't quench a smoking flax
[1:28:05] the
[1:28:06] john the baptist painted the picture
[1:28:08] like he was going to you know like that
[1:28:10] day in the temple when he threw out the
[1:28:11] money changers like that was going to be
[1:28:13] his ministry every day
[1:28:16] i mean throwing the tables over beating
[1:28:18] their backs straightened up he did that
[1:28:20] one time
[1:28:21] to fulfill the scripture which said the
[1:28:23] zeal of the of the lord is is eating me
[1:28:25] up
[1:28:29] so
[1:28:31] that's the that's the image john was
[1:28:34] looking for
[1:28:35] that's the picture he was painting
[1:28:39] and in the messy three kinds of
[1:28:40] believers from 63 he says when the
[1:28:42] crowds were separating
[1:28:44] between the believers and unbelievers
[1:28:46] and make believers there was all three
[1:28:47] of them standing right there in the one
[1:28:49] company of people believers make
[1:28:51] believers unbelievers right found in
[1:28:53] this chapter right there
[1:28:55] and because that jesus spoke the words
[1:28:57] the way he had it separated his
[1:28:59] congregation but it must be done
[1:29:02] he was a great man as long as he healed
[1:29:04] the sick but when it come down to the
[1:29:05] doctrine and the prophecy
[1:29:07] that's what separated the chaff from the
[1:29:09] wheat
[1:29:10] the chaff only wraps around the wheat
[1:29:12] it's not the wheat it cannot be used
[1:29:14] there's nothing in it no life in it it's
[1:29:16] the husk and it cannot stay with the
[1:29:18] wheat it won't be air with the wheat and
[1:29:20] so it's got just the grain is what we're
[1:29:23] talking about the heart of the grain of
[1:29:25] the wheat
[1:29:27] so
[1:29:28] jesus when he came
[1:29:31] john the baptist had painted the picture
[1:29:34] of a man with a fan in his hand
[1:29:36] thoroughly purging his threshing floor
[1:29:38] amen
[1:29:39] burning the chaff with unquenchable fire
[1:29:41] the axe is now laid to the root of the
[1:29:43] tree all of these things but jesus come
[1:29:46] along meek and and you know when they
[1:29:48] would come against him he'd slip through
[1:29:49] the crowd and go somewhere else amen
[1:29:51] when they wanted to kill him jerusalem
[1:29:52] he stayed out of jerusalem for a period
[1:29:54] of time amen but he was still doing the
[1:29:56] work of separating but how was he doing
[1:29:59] the work of separating he was doing it
[1:30:01] by the word amen
[1:30:04] he was he was saying amen uh you know
[1:30:08] unless you drink my blood
[1:30:10] and eat my flesh you have no life with
[1:30:12] me
[1:30:14] you know
[1:30:14] he didn't have to be mean
[1:30:17] the statement itself was going to bring
[1:30:19] a separation
[1:30:21] he was preaching the truth amen of
[1:30:24] spiritual communion of partaking of
[1:30:26] christ he said lest you drink my blood
[1:30:28] and eat my flesh you have no life with
[1:30:29] me and many of his disciples said this
[1:30:31] is a hard saying who can hear it amen
[1:30:33] and many walked away and then they they
[1:30:36] go to ask him you know it's a hard
[1:30:38] saying and he says well if you don't
[1:30:39] like that what about if you shall see
[1:30:41] the son of man
[1:30:43] return into heaven where he came from
[1:30:46] and the rest walked away
[1:30:49] what was he separating by not by his
[1:30:52] attitude
[1:30:54] not by his hardness or his harshness he
[1:30:56] was separating by the revelation of the
[1:30:59] word he was dropping the revelation of
[1:31:01] the word and they couldn't handle the
[1:31:02] word for their day
[1:31:04] they couldn't handle the fresh
[1:31:05] revelation of the word amen it was
[1:31:07] confusing to them it didn't sound right
[1:31:10] it actually sounded wrong to drink blood
[1:31:13] and eat flesh and you as a human being
[1:31:15] come down from heaven it didn't sound
[1:31:17] right it was it didn't make sense to
[1:31:19] their understanding it didn't sound like
[1:31:21] what they had been been hearing in their
[1:31:23] traditional understanding amen and he
[1:31:25] brought the word amen in such a way it
[1:31:28] brought a separation
[1:31:31] amen and the message has come to bring
[1:31:32] us back to the true revelation of the
[1:31:34] word for our day and the message brings
[1:31:37] separation
[1:31:39] not with an arrogant attitude not with a
[1:31:42] hateful speech or a hard delivery it
[1:31:45] brings you can whisper the true
[1:31:46] revelation and it'll bring a separation
[1:31:50] amen
[1:31:52] because what was god doing
[1:31:54] he was separating
[1:31:56] the wheat
[1:31:57] from the husk
[1:32:00] he had 70 that had went two by two
[1:32:03] preaching the gospel and now they walked
[1:32:04] away and he turns to peter and to the
[1:32:08] disciples he said well you go also
[1:32:12] he is this is not the gathering time for
[1:32:15] jesus's ministry this is the time that
[1:32:17] he's blowing chaff away
[1:32:20] separating out the multitude separating
[1:32:23] out the 70 turning to the closest
[1:32:26] friends is his closest companions as
[1:32:28] helping the ministry to the disciples
[1:32:31] and he said will you go also
[1:32:34] and peter says to whom shall we go thou
[1:32:36] alone have the words
[1:32:38] they had no place else to go they didn't
[1:32:40] have an explanation for what he said
[1:32:42] they didn't have an understanding or
[1:32:43] comprehension of what they said what
[1:32:45] they had was a c gene on the inside that
[1:32:48] could say there's no place else to go
[1:32:50] this is truth amen this is right i may
[1:32:52] not understand it i can't explain it i
[1:32:54] don't know why everybody's leaving but
[1:32:56] this is the truth amen and what was he
[1:32:58] doing he was using the revelation of the
[1:33:01] word to separate the chaff from the
[1:33:03] wheat
[1:33:07] amen
[1:33:10] i say what do we do to trodden up the
[1:33:12] corn preach the true word of god
[1:33:14] preach the revelation it's our preach
[1:33:16] the message the way it was delivered to
[1:33:18] us
[1:33:21] amen and it'll separate
[1:33:24] the the chaff from the wheat
[1:33:30] brother brahms says in questions and
[1:33:32] answers from 1964
[1:33:35] says how can i take a cockle burr and
[1:33:37] make a grain of wheat out of it
[1:33:39] it's impossible for me to do it the only
[1:33:41] way it can be is because inside that
[1:33:43] cockle burn has been transmitted from
[1:33:45] cockapoo wheat a cockapoo to a germ
[1:33:47] called wheat life
[1:33:50] then
[1:33:51] you bury that cockapoo in a produced
[1:33:53] grain of wheat that's right see because
[1:33:55] there has been a life of wheat put in
[1:33:57] the cockabur and the life of the
[1:33:59] cockapoor has been taken out but the
[1:34:01] nature of the crocodile is still sticky
[1:34:04] and it will be until this new life has
[1:34:06] fully been developed out of the ground
[1:34:09] and raised up again then it comes forth
[1:34:11] then it is no cocklebur but wheat
[1:34:15] but while it's here on earth
[1:34:17] and in out of the earth the cockapoo is
[1:34:20] still sticky but it's got the nature on
[1:34:22] the inside of wheat now he's talking
[1:34:24] about you and i
[1:34:28] and as long as you're in this life
[1:34:29] you're going to be sticky and have a
[1:34:31] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[1:34:34] as long as you live
[1:34:37] but the inside of you
[1:34:38] you're born again and when you're raised
[1:34:41] up you're in the likeness of christ and
[1:34:42] all the sin is gone from you that's the
[1:34:45] thing
[1:34:48] praise be to god
[1:34:51] when we come to the final threshing
[1:34:54] right at the end of all threshing
[1:34:59] the last thing for me to be separated
[1:35:01] from
[1:35:02] is the old man
[1:35:05] the cocklebur that's sticking tight to
[1:35:07] me
[1:35:09] is my flesh and my human spirit
[1:35:12] but this word is bringing such a
[1:35:15] separation
[1:35:17] it's dividing
[1:35:19] the bones and the moral as the soul and
[1:35:21] the spirit what's doing it the sword of
[1:35:23] the word it's dividing that carnal
[1:35:26] spirit from the soul
[1:35:29] what's the word doing it's bringing a
[1:35:30] separation it's threshing it's saying
[1:35:34] that's the old man and that old man has
[1:35:36] got to go
[1:35:39] it cannot stay and you're threshing and
[1:35:41] threshing and threshing until the final
[1:35:44] tearing away of that seed will be the
[1:35:46] tearing away of the old body and
[1:35:49] bringing of the glorified body
[1:35:52] oh
[1:35:53] let's be threshed
[1:35:55] let's stay on the floor amen and stay on
[1:35:58] the floor at the altar of god at the ark
[1:36:00] of the judgment seat which is the mercy
[1:36:02] seat let's stay there and stay under the
[1:36:05] under the word until it strips away
[1:36:07] everything that's not original word
[1:36:10] so we come back to god's original idea
[1:36:15] amen there's one more
[1:36:17] scripture i'd like to look at together
[1:36:20] and that's ruth chapter 3. let's go to
[1:36:22] ruth
[1:36:33] ruth chapter 3.
[1:36:44] we know the story of ruth really well
[1:36:46] we've been through it many times but i
[1:36:48] just want to review some of it
[1:36:50] ruth had was a mole bite she was a
[1:36:52] gentile
[1:36:54] and
[1:36:55] naomi and her husband
[1:36:57] abimelech had went down into moab with
[1:36:59] their two boys
[1:37:01] and they had taken their gentile wives
[1:37:04] and there was a because there was a
[1:37:05] famine in israel they had run away from
[1:37:07] the land they had sold their inheritance
[1:37:09] and lost their inheritance and gone down
[1:37:11] the moab but then abimelech and the two
[1:37:14] sons die and so now naomi and the
[1:37:17] daughters-in-laws are widows we know one
[1:37:19] stays behind but ruth pledges to come
[1:37:21] with naomi she returns back to bethlehem
[1:37:24] with naomi and she begins to serve naomi
[1:37:26] and she begins to work in the field
[1:37:29] gleaning at the time of the barley
[1:37:30] harvest and the barley harvest is a type
[1:37:33] of gathering into the jews and the wheat
[1:37:34] harvest is a type of gathering in the
[1:37:36] gentiles
[1:37:37] then after that is the vintage or the
[1:37:39] wine press and that's a type of
[1:37:41] gathering back to 144 000. so all the
[1:37:43] harvest types god's harvest in the world
[1:37:46] pulling back his scene
[1:37:49] but in the time of barley harvest she's
[1:37:51] in there she's she's laboring she's
[1:37:53] working but
[1:37:54] but it comes a time that naomi gives her
[1:37:56] some instructions
[1:37:58] and let's look here at chapter 3 verse
[1:38:00] 1.
[1:38:03] then naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[1:38:05] her my daughter shall i not seek rest
[1:38:07] for thee that it may be well with thee
[1:38:10] and now is not boaz of our kindred with
[1:38:13] whose maidens thou ha thou wast behold
[1:38:16] he went with barley tonight in the
[1:38:18] threshing floor
[1:38:20] we're going back to the threshing floor
[1:38:23] he went with barley in the threshing
[1:38:26] floor
[1:38:27] wash thyself therefore and anoint thee
[1:38:29] and put the raiment upon thee and get
[1:38:31] thee down to the floor but make not
[1:38:33] thyself known unto man until he shall
[1:38:36] have done eaten and drinking
[1:38:38] and it shall be when he lieth down that
[1:38:40] thou shalt mark the place where he shall
[1:38:42] lie
[1:38:43] and thou shall go in and uncover his
[1:38:45] feet and lay thee down and he will tell
[1:38:47] thee what thou shall do
[1:38:49] she said unto her all that thou sayeth
[1:38:50] unto me i will do
[1:38:52] and she went down into the floor and did
[1:38:54] according to all that her mother-in-law
[1:38:56] made her and when boaz had eaten and
[1:38:59] drunk and his heart was merry he went to
[1:39:02] lie down at the end of the heap of corn
[1:39:05] and she came softly and uncovered his
[1:39:07] feet and laid her down
[1:39:08] and it came to pass at midnight
[1:39:11] that the man was afraid
[1:39:13] and turned himself and behold a woman
[1:39:15] lay at his feet
[1:39:16] and he said who art thou and she said i
[1:39:18] am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore
[1:39:21] thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou
[1:39:23] art near kinsmen
[1:39:25] and he said blessed be thou of the lord
[1:39:28] my daughter for thou has showed more
[1:39:30] kindness in thy latter end
[1:39:32] than at the beginning i want you to pay
[1:39:34] attention to that statement
[1:39:36] thou has showed more kindness in thy
[1:39:38] latter end than at the beginning
[1:39:41] in so much as thou followers not young
[1:39:43] men whether poor or rich
[1:39:45] and now my daughter fear not i will do
[1:39:48] to thee all that thou requirest for all
[1:39:51] the city of my people doth know that
[1:39:54] thou art a virtuous woman
[1:39:58] here comes ruth she's a widow
[1:40:01] she's a young woman
[1:40:02] she's returned back with naomi and
[1:40:04] they're in a desperate situation
[1:40:06] and naomi begins to analyze the
[1:40:09] situation and she's gleaning in the
[1:40:11] field of boaz and boaz is showing her
[1:40:13] favor and having the reapers drop
[1:40:15] handfuls of purpose for her to pick up
[1:40:18] even sitting at the table with them he
[1:40:20] feeds her of his own hand and so naomi's
[1:40:22] putting the pieces together amen and she
[1:40:25] tells ruth amen go into the threshing
[1:40:28] floor amen he's finished finishing the
[1:40:31] barley harvest he's at the time he's
[1:40:33] finishing the barley harvest who is boaz
[1:40:36] he's the lord of the harvest
[1:40:38] is that right
[1:40:40] he's the lord of the harvest he's the
[1:40:42] one with the fan in his hand he was
[1:40:44] purging his floor and at the time he's
[1:40:46] finishing the barley harvest amen he has
[1:40:48] a great feast at the end of the barley
[1:40:50] harvest amen and he lays himself down to
[1:40:52] sleep just like jesus christ after he's
[1:40:54] finished gathering amen the old
[1:40:56] testament and then he lays himself down
[1:40:58] to sleep and at that time she comes into
[1:41:01] the threshing floor which is the place
[1:41:03] of separation the place of judgment and
[1:41:06] she lays herself down at the feet of the
[1:41:09] lord of the harvest in the place of
[1:41:11] separation and judgment and what is she
[1:41:14] doing she is giving her life away
[1:41:18] what is ruth doing she's giving her life
[1:41:20] away what is she giving her life away
[1:41:22] for she's giving it away for redemption
[1:41:25] amen she's not there for money she's not
[1:41:28] there for lust she's not there for a
[1:41:30] handsome husband he says thy kindness is
[1:41:33] greater in the end than it was in the
[1:41:35] beginning it was her kindness to come
[1:41:37] with naomi it was her kindness to
[1:41:39] support naomi but he said the kindness
[1:41:41] at your ladder and is greater than in
[1:41:43] the beginning because now she's
[1:41:45] surrendering herself completely to the
[1:41:48] lord of the harvest
[1:41:50] she's giving up any hope for a younger
[1:41:53] man she's not there she's not there amen
[1:41:56] because of his good looks
[1:41:59] she's not there because of his money
[1:42:02] she's there to give herself away
[1:42:05] for the purpose of redemption
[1:42:08] ruth is sacrificing herself
[1:42:12] on the threshing floor
[1:42:15] ruth is going to give herself and
[1:42:17] marriage to boaz
[1:42:20] an older man he says you didn't seek
[1:42:22] after young men showing that he was an
[1:42:24] older man
[1:42:26] she's she's giving away
[1:42:29] herself
[1:42:31] on the threshing floor
[1:42:33] ruth is sacrificing herself
[1:42:36] for redemption
[1:42:40] that's why we're a type of ruth
[1:42:43] let us come into the threshing floor
[1:42:46] and lay ourselves at the feet
[1:42:48] of the lord of the harvest
[1:42:51] and let's lay down
[1:42:53] and say i'm giving up my life
[1:42:56] for you
[1:42:57] i'm giving up my life for redemption i'm
[1:43:00] giving myself completely she was asking
[1:43:03] to become his wife amen because the only
[1:43:06] way for redemption was for her to
[1:43:09] receive seed from the lord of the
[1:43:11] harvest
[1:43:12] and that seed she would raise up seed
[1:43:14] and that seed would be able to purchase
[1:43:17] the right of redemption
[1:43:19] back for naomi it would restore back so
[1:43:22] she had to give herself just like mary
[1:43:25] had to sacrifice herself to bring forth
[1:43:27] the promised seed
[1:43:30] mary was a young woman mary was engaged
[1:43:32] to be married to a man to a man named
[1:43:35] joseph she was a young girl amen but the
[1:43:37] angel of the lord came to her and say
[1:43:39] this is the time of the fulfillment of
[1:43:41] the word and you're the place for the
[1:43:42] word to be fulfilled but mary had to
[1:43:45] surrender all her ideas her ambitions
[1:43:48] her hopes for her family her dreams of
[1:43:50] the future she had to give everything up
[1:43:53] she had been thinking to receive this
[1:43:55] word and to say be it unto me according
[1:43:57] to thy word
[1:44:00] what was mary doing mary was sacrificing
[1:44:03] herself for
[1:44:04] redemption
[1:44:06] what was ruth doing ruth was coming to
[1:44:09] the threshing floor
[1:44:12] to lay her feet down herself at the feet
[1:44:14] of the lord of harvest to give herself
[1:44:17] for redemption
[1:44:19] and what are you and i here to do
[1:44:22] we are here to come on the threshing
[1:44:24] floor
[1:44:25] to lay our life down
[1:44:27] it doesn't matter what i thought
[1:44:30] what i hoped what i wanted the way i
[1:44:32] thought it was going to work out my own
[1:44:34] ideas my own concept of the way things
[1:44:36] should run i'm here to come to the
[1:44:38] threshing floor to lay it all down to
[1:44:40] lay myself at your feet so you can plant
[1:44:43] a seed in me that will finish the work
[1:44:45] of redemption
[1:44:47] that's what the bride has come to
[1:44:49] in this hour
[1:44:52] and i say lord
[1:44:54] let me lay myself down on the threshing
[1:44:56] floor
[1:44:58] let me give up everything i ever wanted
[1:45:01] or thought
[1:45:03] for redemption
[1:45:05] this plan of redemption is so beautiful
[1:45:07] this plan of redemption is so perfect
[1:45:09] this plan that we see all through the
[1:45:11] bible is so beautiful why wouldn't we
[1:45:14] want to give ourselves to it
[1:45:16] i want to do what ruth did
[1:45:19] and lay myself down at the feet of the
[1:45:21] lord of the harvest
[1:45:22] and give myself away
[1:45:25] give myself completely away
[1:45:28] for the purpose of redemption
[1:45:31] say god
[1:45:34] you're a good thresher
[1:45:37] thresh me out o lord
[1:45:39] purge me
[1:45:41] cleanse my heart
[1:45:43] let me be
[1:45:44] what you wanted me to be before the
[1:45:46] foundation of the world when you saw me
[1:45:48] in your mind
[1:45:49] and now i'm here living out my portion
[1:45:51] of the drama
[1:45:52] let me come to the threshing floor and
[1:45:55] find there a place of mercy for me
[1:45:59] let me find a place of mercy as i lay my
[1:46:03] down my life down and sacrifice myself
[1:46:06] for this plan of redemption for this
[1:46:07] word in the end time
[1:46:09] i want to lay it down
[1:46:11] and said take me
[1:46:13] be it unto me
[1:46:15] according to thy word
[1:46:17] is that your dream is that your hope is
[1:46:18] that your desire
[1:46:20] to be all that he wants us to be
[1:46:22] amen let's all stand together
[1:46:24] musicians if you would come please
[1:46:29] amen there's so many places in the bible
[1:46:31] that we could turn to and so many things
[1:46:33] we could look at
[1:46:36] and remember this theme holds true
[1:46:40] god
[1:46:41] is separating
[1:46:43] us
[1:46:44] unto himself
[1:46:46] god is
[1:46:47] looking for a surrendered vessel he's
[1:46:50] looking for somebody that will give up
[1:46:52] that'll lay down that'll come willingly
[1:46:55] and lay upon the threshing floor to
[1:46:57] become one with him so that he can
[1:47:00] finish his work of redemption in this
[1:47:02] day
[1:47:03] and i for one want to keep coming to the
[1:47:05] threshing floor
[1:47:07] is it always convenient nope is it
[1:47:10] always easy absolutely not does it
[1:47:13] sometimes hurt have you ever been hurt
[1:47:14] by the word
[1:47:17] if you haven't stick around
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:21] but it's all
[1:47:22] for god's great plan and god's great
[1:47:24] purpose
[1:47:25] and i say thank god
[1:47:27] that for some the threshing floor is a
[1:47:30] place of judgment
[1:47:31] but not for me
[1:47:33] for me it's a place of mercy
[1:47:36] because god wanted me from before the
[1:47:39] foundation of the world and he wants
[1:47:41] just that part that he sowed
[1:47:44] and so he's stripping everything else
[1:47:45] away and i say thank you lord
[1:47:48] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[1:47:52] we thank you father for your word lord
[1:47:56] god i pray that you would do the work in

[1:48:11] laying ourselves at your feet take us
[1:48:14] and use us for your kingdom lord
[1:48:17] god let that word strip away
[1:48:19] all of our wrong ideas all of our wrong
[1:48:22] concepts let that word strip away
[1:48:25] everything that's not part of your
[1:48:26] original word your original thought
[1:48:29] and help me to remain patient lord
[1:48:33] to not get the disturbed in my mind at
[1:48:36] the trials and at the testing but help
[1:48:38] me remain patient and let patience have
[1:48:41] a perfect work making me entire complete
[1:48:44] wanting nothing

[1:48:49] one with the winnowing fork the fan as
[1:48:52] you purge your floor
[1:48:54] as you separate out of me everything
