[1:01] amen it's amazing how god is able to do
[1:04] that
[1:05] you may have served him 40 years maybe
[1:07] 50 years and
[1:08] maybe 40 50 years under the revelation
[1:10] of this word but he can still

[2:52] any surprise that we're gonna start here
[2:54] in matthew chapter one we should have it
[2:57] fairly close to memorized by now but
[2:59] we'll look at the first verse the book
[3:01] of the generation of jesus christ the
[3:04] son of david the son of abraham
[3:06] abraham begat isaac and isaac begat
[3:08] jacob and jacob begot judas and his
[3:11] brethren
[3:12] and judas begat pharas and zarah of
[3:14] tamar
[3:15] and pharas begot ezram and ezram begat
[3:18] abraham
[3:19] and abraham begat aminadab and amina
[3:21] debbie got nayasan
[3:22] and naasan begot solomon and solomon
[3:25] begot boaz
[3:26] of rahab and boazby got obed
[3:29] of ruth and o webb begot jesse
[3:32] and jesse begot david the king and david
[3:36] the king
[3:36] begat solomon of her that had been the
[3:40] wife
[3:40] of uriah and we've talked about tamar
[3:44] we've talked about rahab spoke about
[3:46] ruth and now with the grace of god and
[3:48] by his help we want to look at
[3:50] the why the her that had been wife of
[3:52] uriah which we know as bathsheba
[3:54] let's bow our heads and ask the lord to
[3:56] bless the reading of his word
[3:57] the heavenly father we thank you lord
[3:59] for this wonderful time
[4:01] for this day that we have lord to set
[4:04] aside to draw ourselves aside and come
[4:06] together
[4:07] to worship your holy name lord we love
[4:10] you as we look into your word we pray
[4:11] that you would do what no man can do
[4:14] we pray that you would come and break
[4:15] your word lord
[4:17] i offer to you myself lord this morning
[4:19] and i have
[4:20] nothing more to give lord i i cannot do
[4:23] anything without you we're just as
[4:24] helpless
[4:25] as a little baby lord but my god there
[4:27] was one day a little boy
[4:29] brought you some fishes and loaves and
[4:31] what we bring together
[4:32] is less than that lord we bring it to
[4:34] you but we lay it in your hands knowing
[4:36] you can multiply lord that you can work
[4:38] the supernatural lord and we're not
[4:40] looking to any ability of humans we're
[4:42] looking to you
[4:43] to come and take what's placed in your
[4:45] hand and multiply it lord and magnify
[4:48] your name and be glorified in this place
[4:50] speak to your children lord your word
[4:53] help us grow
[4:54] have preeminence in us lord in jesus
[4:56] name we pray
[4:57] amen you can all be seated
[5:01] if we if we keep our bibles here in
[5:03] saint matthew i just want to
[5:05] make note of something here in the first
[5:08] chapter
[5:09] we look we've got we've got four women
[5:12] mentioned that the four women we've been
[5:14] talking about
[5:15] and it says the generation of jesus
[5:17] christ the son of david the son of
[5:19] abraham
[5:20] so as we go down through this genealogy
[5:22] amen we go through
[5:24] go through this there's only these four
[5:27] that are mentioned in this section
[5:29] and in all four of them if you just look
[5:32] at
[5:32] all four all four of the cases are
[5:34] unusual
[5:35] all four of these cases and we spoke
[5:37] about this before but we want to just
[5:38] recap it here
[5:40] you take the situation of tamar and how
[5:42] tamar
[5:43] had to play the part of a harlot and lie
[5:45] with her father-in-law to receive the
[5:47] seed
[5:47] and to bring forth pharas and and and
[5:50] god would decide to include it right
[5:52] here
[5:53] now i don't know about you but if i was
[5:55] writing a book
[5:57] and i was writing a book about my
[5:59] children and my family and my heritage
[6:00] and all i was going to do
[6:02] i wouldn't write it the way god wrote
[6:03] his
[6:05] mine would be clean mine we would leave
[6:08] out all the things that were
[6:10] embarrassing or all of the things that
[6:11] were mistakes
[6:12] and we would just highlight the good
[6:14] things but god is trying to show
[6:16] something there
[6:17] there's something working through the
[6:18] scripture that's more powerful
[6:21] than a perfect life it's more powerful
[6:25] than good conduct amen
[6:26] and the thing that's moving down through
[6:28] the scriptures as we read
[6:30] we look we look at mistakes and
[6:32] adulteries and sins and murders and
[6:34] all kinds of stuff and it's going to
[6:35] become apparent as we get into bathsheba
[6:37] and david
[6:38] that all of this is happening here but
[6:40] yet there's a seed life that's moving
[6:43] through
[6:43] as it weaves its way through by
[6:45] predestination and
[6:46] nothing is going to stop that seed no
[6:49] sin no bad conduct
[6:51] no immorality there's nothing going to
[6:53] stop that from coming through
[6:54] because god has already assigned grace
[6:57] to that seed line
[6:58] that's his love that's his life his
[7:00] children coming down through
[7:02] and that's why there had to be a lamb
[7:04] slain
[7:05] not 2 000 years ago but there had to be
[7:07] a land slain before the foundation
[7:10] of the world when he took the names of
[7:14] that seed and he would record
[7:16] he would record that in the lamb's book
[7:18] of life and it would be sealed before
[7:20] the foundation of the world
[7:21] the lamb was slain in the mind of god
[7:24] before the foundation of the world
[7:26] because god is trying to accomplish a
[7:28] purpose and his purpose is so that he
[7:30] can be known by his attributes
[7:33] they couldn't be known in perfection he
[7:35] meant so he had to allow a situation
[7:37] where the imperfect can come so he will
[7:39] be known as a redeemer
[7:40] as a savior amen one that can cleanse
[7:43] and sanctify
[7:44] and all those things it had to be known
[7:46] this way but there's another purpose
[7:48] that's working all the way through the
[7:49] bible
[7:50] and all through scripture god is working
[7:52] the destruction
[7:53] of satan amen
[7:56] don't ask me how he's doing it but he's
[7:58] doing it he's doing it through weakness
[8:00] he's made straight his strength is made
[8:02] perfect through weakness
[8:03] amen and then he's allowing satan to
[8:06] trip and trap and
[8:07] and cause all kinds of problems to the
[8:09] seed of god amen so it looks like it's
[8:11] defeated
[8:12] it's defeated it's defeated and it's as
[8:14] if amen he keeps pouring concrete over
[8:16] it
[8:18] then the sun comes up and you see it pop
[8:19] out the side of the concrete
[8:22] our god will come and crack the concrete
[8:24] and you see it and break its way through
[8:25] amen he's always trying to stop the seed
[8:28] stop the seed in the church i believe
[8:30] it's the church age book brother branham
[8:32] says
[8:32] amen the devil's been exposed in all of
[8:34] his works
[8:35] trying to destroy god's people and
[8:38] discredit god's word
[8:40] so if you want to know what the devil's
[8:41] doing he's trying to destroy god's
[8:44] people and discredit god's word
[8:46] that's his works that's all he's trying
[8:48] to do amen he's not trying i mean to get
[8:51] another beer joint to come in he's not
[8:53] trying to get another house of
[8:54] prostitution to come in
[8:55] that's not where he's working he's
[8:57] working wherever the truth is coming
[8:59] forth
[8:59] trying to discredit god's word and
[9:02] destroy
[9:03] god's people amen
[9:07] so so if you want to know where his
[9:09] works are that's where he's at
[9:10] and he's always trying to do it and and
[9:12] it's amazing that he's
[9:13] always he's always down through here
[9:15] trying to derail the plan of god
[9:18] through sin and through through all
[9:20] kinds of terrible conditions
[9:22] but god's plan marches right on despite
[9:25] all of this stuff so when god is going
[9:28] to show the generation of jesus christ
[9:30] he doesn't list sarah he doesn't list
[9:32] rachel he doesn't list rebecca
[9:34] they're not mentioned in there amen
[9:36] because they all only had one husband
[9:38] they've they've done things right they
[9:40] got married the right way
[9:42] amen but now god's going to show that he
[9:44] can take wrong and turn it right amen
[9:47] he can take a woman amen who's been a
[9:50] harlot and rahab has been a harlot in
[9:52] jericho
[9:53] and he can take her and justify her and
[9:55] sanctify her by her marriage through
[9:57] solomon
[9:57] and through that he can bring forth the
[9:59] kinsmen redeemer
[10:01] boaz when we read through this it should
[10:04] make us the happiest people that have
[10:06] ever walked this planet
[10:07] because the thing the devil tries to do
[10:09] is to get us discouraged because of
[10:10] what's happened in the past
[10:12] amen but that's why the lamb was slain
[10:14] before the foundation of the world
[10:17] is because we would come into this
[10:18] condition and he would try to stop the
[10:21] seed
[10:21] through every measure that he could stop
[10:23] the seed by
[10:25] but yet god would shine the light that
[10:28] seed would be regenerated by that light
[10:30] and poke through wherever it could find
[10:32] and come to life
[10:35] you can't stop god's plan amen
[10:38] so now he he writes in this in this
[10:41] generation in this genealogy he puts
[10:44] tamar in there
[10:45] and and these women all neither none of
[10:47] these women
[10:49] all of these women had received seed
[10:52] from another source
[10:55] but none of these women could conceive
[10:57] on that seed
[11:01] they were predestinated women do you
[11:03] believe that
[11:05] predestinated women to bring
[11:09] forth amen in the genealogy of christ
[11:14] do you think that do you think that this
[11:17] portion of the scripture
[11:19] do you think it was written
[11:22] now put your thinking caps on do you
[11:24] think it was written
[11:26] nearly 2 000 years ago or before the
[11:28] foundation of the world
[11:31] it may have got inked out nearly 2 000
[11:34] years ago but it was already decided in
[11:36] the mind of god
[11:37] that this is going to be the generation
[11:39] of jesus christ
[11:43] hallelujah amen you think god's taken by
[11:47] surprise
[11:48] that rahab ends up a harlot in jericho
[11:51] do you think he's surprised at that
[11:52] and he said oh i was going to use her
[11:55] amen to bring forth the generation of
[11:57] jesus christ but now i can't because she
[12:00] so defiled herself
[12:04] i was going to use him i was going to
[12:06] use her but now i can't
[12:08] because of all the mistakes they made
[12:09] amen you forget he's the lamb slain
[12:12] before the foundation of the world
[12:15] amen he can use whom he wants amen he's
[12:18] already determined
[12:19] and nothing's going to change what he's
[12:20] already determined
[12:22] and if he's determined that about me
[12:24] amen nothing's going to stop god
[12:26] from taking this lump of clay and
[12:28] fulfilling his purpose
[12:31] hallelujah so now we find out when he
[12:35] when he writes these
[12:36] genealogies you've got tamar amen then
[12:38] you've got rahab the harlan and jericho
[12:41] amen receiving seed but no conception
[12:43] until she comes to salmon
[12:44] and now there's a conception and now she
[12:46] she brings forth boaz and now boaz
[12:49] amen how is it boaz this rich ruler
[12:52] amen how is it that he's not married
[12:55] with sons
[12:57] how is it how is it it mean one of the
[12:59] most eligible men in bethlehem
[13:03] because the scripture says he was very
[13:04] wealthy
[13:07] one of the most eligible men was he
[13:09] married
[13:10] and his wife passed away with no
[13:12] children was he never married i don't
[13:13] know
[13:14] the bible doesn't tell us but somehow we
[13:16] find him not married with no firstborn
[13:19] son and now he's here
[13:21] what's he waiting for he's waiting for
[13:23] the plan of god amen
[13:26] and now he takes ruth who ruth had been
[13:28] married before
[13:29] receiving seed but there's no conception
[13:32] she's outside the land
[13:33] she's brought into the land and now boaz
[13:36] takes ruth the moabitess
[13:40] but boaz has no problem taking the
[13:43] moabite
[13:44] because his mother was the harlot from
[13:46] rehab harley rahab from jericho
[13:49] i mean he doesn't have a problem
[13:51] understanding how this can work how god
[13:53] can bring good from evil
[13:54] because look at his birth
[13:58] so now nobody else may have been willing
[14:01] to
[14:02] redeem naomi to take ruth his wife but
[14:05] boaz had no problem
[14:06] because there was an understanding in
[14:08] boaz of the plan and nature of god
[14:11] because he's here amen and he knows
[14:13] where his mother's coming through what
[14:15] his dad's coming through
[14:16] how they've met outside the camp how god
[14:18] brought them together how they
[14:20] established bethlehem
[14:21] and now he stands here amen the prince
[14:23] in the house of judah
[14:24] in the house of god's bread very very
[14:27] wealthy amen could have married anybody
[14:29] he wanted
[14:30] to bring up seed but he's got to wait
[14:32] amen for the gentile woman
[14:34] who couldn't conceive anywhere else to
[14:35] come into the land
[14:38] then he's going to play out redemption
[14:39] take her and raise up seed
[14:43] this is all in the first six verses of
[14:46] the new testament
[14:51] now
[14:54] boaz and ruth
[14:58] bring forth obed and obed will bring
[15:01] forth jesse
[15:02] and jesse will bring forth david the
[15:04] king
[15:05] and david the king begat solomon
[15:09] of her that had been wife of urias
[15:13] now you see how easy that would have
[15:14] been to leave out
[15:17] like begat solomon let's look at verse
[15:20] 6.
[15:24] let's go back to verse five so when we
[15:26] got boaz of rahab and boaz we got obed
[15:28] of ruth okay now from here on us look
[15:30] in obad begot jesse jesse begot david
[15:34] the king
[15:34] david the king begot solomon period
[15:37] verse 7 and solomon begot rebel it would
[15:40] have been really easy to leave that out
[15:43] you don't need it in here except for the
[15:45] fact god wants it in here
[15:47] [Music]
[15:50] why does he want a story like that put
[15:54] in a place like this
[15:57] hallelujah god is good friends
[16:01] so then we go from verse 7
[16:07] all the way down to 16 we have all these
[16:10] genealogies
[16:11] coming through but there's no other
[16:14] women mentioned
[16:17] until we get to mary and she's mentioned
[16:19] in verse 16.
[16:21] so now in the generation of jesus christ
[16:23] there's a lot of other women
[16:25] there's a lot of other names that you
[16:27] can name there's a lot of other
[16:30] women that you can include in the bible
[16:32] amen in this generation jesus christ but
[16:34] god didn't want them included
[16:36] these were the only ones that he wanted
[16:38] to be included
[16:42] say thank you god and there's a mystery
[16:46] laying here
[16:47] and i just want to share with you just
[16:48] just what i see on this
[16:50] as you're coming through you come to
[16:52] solomon
[16:53] who's who he begot solomon of her that
[16:56] had been wife of urias from bathsheba
[16:58] and then there's nothing else mentioned
[17:01] now till you get to mary in verse 16.
[17:03] and you wonder why would you cluster
[17:06] them all here
[17:07] why here and not anywhere else why
[17:09] aren't why aren't there women sprinkled
[17:11] out through the entire thing you know
[17:13] make it fair every three or four verses
[17:15] throw a woman in there
[17:18] because that's not what god's doing amen
[17:20] he's not trying to say we've got so many
[17:22] men we got so many women we don't want
[17:23] the women to feel left out
[17:26] all of these women had a little bit of
[17:28] an odd thing in their reputation that
[17:30] made him a little questionable
[17:33] they were either gentile moabite they
[17:35] were either a harlot
[17:37] or they had played a harlot and tricked
[17:40] their i mean there's
[17:41] these aren't the examples that you want
[17:43] to set forth
[17:44] maybe when you're sitting forth i want
[17:46] to throw a few women in there to
[17:47] encourage the
[17:48] christian sisters so they can really
[17:50] look at a moral you would put rachel in
[17:52] there or rebecca amen these are not the
[17:55] women that you would put in
[17:56] amen if it was just a lesson on the fact
[17:58] that god uses men and women
[18:02] now it is a lesson that god uses men and
[18:04] women but he doesn't use them
[18:05] in perfection he doesn't
[18:08] the seed is coming through and he wants
[18:10] us to see
[18:12] these four women happen to be gentile
[18:14] women
[18:16] and these four gentile women are in this
[18:18] genealogy
[18:19] but it's amazing they're in the
[18:20] genealogy at critical points
[18:23] in the genealogy till they get to
[18:25] solomon and then they're not mentioned
[18:26] anymore
[18:27] and so the critical points now we come
[18:30] to
[18:30] to to jacob jacob has 12 sons one of
[18:33] those 12 sons the fourth
[18:34] the fourth son is going to be where the
[18:36] scepter lands where the king line is
[18:38] coming through through judah
[18:40] he's the lion tribe and we know that the
[18:42] king's coming from this
[18:43] and in this junction amen the sons of
[18:46] judah
[18:47] are wicked and god slays the first two
[18:50] and then tamar was married to the first
[18:52] amen he was wicked god killed him the
[18:54] second one refuses to raise up seed for
[18:56] his brother
[18:56] he's wicked god kills him the third one
[18:58] is withheld
[18:59] and now this whole heritage is in
[19:01] jeopardy
[19:03] now this whole line of judah which is
[19:05] the king
[19:06] line is in jeopardy and now there's
[19:08] something wrong in this line
[19:10] because tamar was the wife had already
[19:12] come into a union with the firstborn
[19:14] sign
[19:15] now they've got to raise up seed to the
[19:16] name of the deceased to keep that
[19:18] birthright coming down
[19:20] amen and now judah in his
[19:22] unrighteousness because when he finds
[19:24] out what tamar has done
[19:26] she lays the tokens of the man who she's
[19:28] pregnant by before him and he recognizes
[19:30] that he's the man
[19:31] and he says she is more righteous than i
[19:35] so judah in his righteousness is holding
[19:37] back his son from her
[19:38] because righteousness would be to bring
[19:40] up seed for the name of the dead
[19:44] and so tamar in her
[19:47] playing the harlot and trapping her
[19:50] father-in-law
[19:52] is more righteous than judah
[19:55] we're in a junction here where through
[19:57] tamar
[19:58] this this seedline has to come and at a
[20:01] critical point
[20:02] god throws a gentile woman in there
[20:05] through an
[20:06] odd circumstance and keeps the line
[20:08] going
[20:10] then we come down to solomon and rahab
[20:13] and now they're moving into the land
[20:15] amen they're moving into the inheritance
[20:17] they're coming into the word
[20:19] to establish the land amen and so now as
[20:21] judas coming to take their portion in
[20:24] the land
[20:24] there's another critical juncture in
[20:26] scripture they're moving into the land
[20:28] solomon will get his portion of land
[20:30] amen and raise up seed
[20:32] but now he can't take just any woman now
[20:35] he's got to have
[20:36] the harlot of of jericho at this
[20:39] critical time
[20:41] when judah is being founded in the
[20:43] promised land
[20:45] you see this wasn't just you know just a
[20:48] one-off he took a gentile woman and they
[20:50] got married no these were
[20:51] critical times these were important
[20:55] junctures
[20:56] that were taking place and that's when
[20:59] god wants to highlight
[21:00] now when they're moving into the land to
[21:02] establish themselves in the land
[21:03] now i'm going to take a harlot out of
[21:06] jericho move her outside the camp
[21:08] bring solomon the prince of the house of
[21:10] judah move him outside the camp
[21:12] they're going to unite together and
[21:13] they're going to establish bethlehem
[21:15] the house of god's bread and then now we
[21:19] come to another junction in time
[21:21] where now now naomi and ruth they come
[21:24] they come back into the lamb but boaz
[21:27] doesn't
[21:28] have a seed
[21:31] boaz has no seed and he's here in
[21:34] bethlehem
[21:35] and bethlehem is going to be the place
[21:37] where christ must be born
[21:38] that lineage must stay there amen so now
[21:42] there's apparently there's not a woman
[21:45] in bethlehem that'll work for boaz
[21:48] there's not a woman around for boaz so
[21:51] god will bring a
[21:52] moabitish woman amen into the land with
[21:56] naomi
[21:57] amen and that's going to be the one
[21:59] that's going to keep the seed line
[22:01] coming down
[22:04] and then the next one we come to
[22:07] is when king david is going to have an
[22:10] heir
[22:12] this is really important because the
[22:14] kingdom was really established under
[22:16] david a man after god's own heart
[22:17] and the kingdom of israel was
[22:18] established and now there's going to be
[22:20] a prophecy laid down for the son of
[22:23] david
[22:23] he said somebody shall sit on your
[22:25] throne forever
[22:27] and it's a prophecy speaking of christ
[22:30] but now this
[22:31] natural son that's going to be heir to
[22:33] his father is going to portray christ
[22:36] so it's very important what baby's born
[22:40] would you agree this heir that comes
[22:42] from david that's going to go to the
[22:44] throne
[22:44] it's very critical what kind of baby
[22:46] this is
[22:47] because this is going to be the one that
[22:49] portrays the coming prophecy
[22:50] of the coming king that will sit forever
[22:52] on the throne of david
[22:55] and so in order for god to do this right
[23:01] he's got to take bathsheba
[23:04] through adultery murder
[23:07] all this horrible stuff then marry her
[23:11] and the baby that they have is going to
[23:13] be
[23:14] solomon and solomon
[23:17] is going to be a scriptural type of
[23:19] christ coming to the throne in the
[23:21] millennium
[23:24] now i don't know about you but if i was
[23:25] writing the story i would do it
[23:27] different
[23:29] i wouldn't have had solomon come that
[23:30] way but god did
[23:35] and i believe it was perfect it was
[23:38] all wrong but it was perfect
[23:41] it was completely wrong but it was
[23:44] perfect
[23:46] don't ask me explain that because i
[23:48] absolutely have no way to do it
[23:50] i can't explain it it's 100 wrong it's
[23:52] all completely wrong
[23:54] but it's right or it works together for
[23:57] right
[23:58] say it that way so now i just wanted to
[24:01] point this out
[24:02] now for through through these verses
[24:06] that we're looking at
[24:07] we've got these four women coming up to
[24:09] solomon but after
[24:10] solomon there's no gentile women
[24:12] mentioned and now
[24:14] you have to ask yourself why is that
[24:16] what's the critical junction at solomon
[24:18] and now you realize solomon was a type
[24:20] of christ when solomon came to the
[24:23] throne
[24:23] there was peace now established
[24:25] throughout the kingdom and brother
[24:27] benham said they moved into their golden
[24:29] age
[24:30] to the type of the millennium the jews
[24:32] moved into so this was the highest
[24:34] the jewish nation ever came
[24:37] this is their high spot this is this is
[24:40] the perfect place
[24:41] for the jewish nation all the prophecies
[24:43] come to pass they moved into this
[24:44] position they had peace all around they
[24:46] had prosperity
[24:47] they had the son of david who's the son
[24:49] of god
[24:50] who's the builder of the temple they had
[24:52] temple worship in place they had the
[24:54] wisest man in all the earth sitting on
[24:56] the throne
[24:56] perfectly portraying christ in the
[24:58] millennium
[25:00] and from then on it was downhill next
[25:02] generation they split to north and south
[25:04] southern kingdoms amen they fall into
[25:06] discrepancy they fall into all kinds of
[25:08] trouble amen the north kingdom gets
[25:09] carried away to assyria the southern
[25:11] kingdom eventually gets carried away to
[25:13] babylon
[25:13] from that point on it's downhill
[25:16] and god did not want a gentile bride
[25:19] mentioned in the downhill slide amen
[25:22] she's there to bring amen
[25:25] the gentile woman is there to bring
[25:28] israel to the millennium
[25:29] that's her purpose through four stages
[25:32] she's here to bring him to a millennium
[25:34] because the gentile bride now is to
[25:36] bring us to christ in the millennium
[25:39] through four stages through four
[25:41] anointing things amen to bring us to
[25:43] what
[25:43] christ after that the downhill slide
[25:47] we're not going to mention the gentiles
[25:48] because the gentile woman today
[25:50] is to build to christ
[25:54] i think that's fantastic
[25:57] laying right in the word constructed
[26:00] just the way god wants it constructed
[26:03] hallelujah let's turn quickly and
[26:06] and look at first corinthians i just
[26:08] want to look at this before we jump back
[26:10] in the second samuel first corinthians
[26:13] chapter two
[26:15] i want to read something paul wrote
[26:25] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 6
[26:30] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[26:32] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[26:34] this world nor the princes of this world
[26:36] that come to not but we speak the wisdom
[26:38] of god in a mystery
[26:41] so he's speaking the wisdom of god
[26:45] but he's speaking in a mystery
[26:49] even the hidden wisdom which god
[26:50] ordained before the world unto our glory
[26:53] which none of the princes of this world
[26:55] knew for had they known it they would
[26:56] not have crucified the lord of glory
[26:59] but as it is written i have not seen nor
[27:01] ear heard neither had entered into the
[27:03] heart of man the thing
[27:04] which god hath prepared for them that
[27:06] love him but god hath revealed them unto
[27:09] us by his spirit
[27:11] for the spirit searcheth all things yay
[27:14] the deep things of god
[27:15] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[27:17] save the spirit of man which is in him
[27:20] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[27:22] but the spirit of god
[27:24] now we have received not the spirit of
[27:25] the world but the spirit which is
[27:27] of god that we might know the things
[27:29] that are freely given to us of god
[27:32] which things also we speak not in the
[27:34] words which man's wisdom teacheth
[27:36] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[27:38] comparing spiritual things was spiritual
[27:41] but the natural man receiveth not the
[27:43] things of the spirit of god
[27:45] for they are foolishness unto him
[27:46] neither can he know them because they
[27:48] are spiritually
[27:49] discerned but he that is spiritual
[27:52] judges all things yet he himself is
[27:53] judge of no man
[27:55] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[27:56] that he may instruct him
[27:58] but we have the mind of christ
[28:03] so paul is here he's teaching but not in
[28:06] the teaching of man's wisdom
[28:09] he's teaching not he's giving
[28:10] understanding but not natural
[28:12] understanding
[28:13] he's here comparing spiritual things
[28:15] with spiritual things because they're
[28:16] given
[28:17] by the spirit of god amen so that's why
[28:20] the the the things that we look at and
[28:22] the things that we see
[28:23] the things that we look at in the
[28:24] scripture have everything to do
[28:26] with a spiritual revelation from god the
[28:29] father because when brother branham came
[28:31] and brought this message he didn't bring
[28:32] it in a denominational seminary way
[28:36] he didn't indeed with with man's wisdom
[28:39] amen he come
[28:40] comparing spiritual things with
[28:42] spiritual
[28:43] he comes showing us types and shadows
[28:46] and he's comparing
[28:47] the spiritual things now with the
[28:48] spiritual things then and it's the same
[28:50] thing jesus did it's the same thing the
[28:52] apostle paul did
[28:54] amen and so now their foolishness to the
[28:58] mind of a man
[28:59] but that's not for them amen it's for
[29:02] the ones that god will reveal it by the
[29:04] spirit
[29:04] comparing spiritual things with
[29:06] spiritual things so you don't
[29:08] the bible is not meant to be taught like
[29:10] a textbook teaching
[29:12] amen like a like a seminary type
[29:14] teaching on the textbook
[29:16] it's comparing spiritual things with
[29:18] spiritual things
[29:19] it's to be spiritually discerned by
[29:22] those who have the mind of christ
[29:27] that would save a lot of tuition and a
[29:28] lot of college campuses
[29:32] because it's just not necessary
[29:36] second samuel three let's turn there
[29:39] together and we're going to look at this
[29:40] story
[29:42] i have to confess to you at the
[29:43] beginning this is a strange
[29:45] story this is a hard
[29:49] story but this is god's story
[29:54] amen when we go to look at this there's
[29:57] so many things that you could get into
[29:58] and there's so many things that could be
[30:00] done with this
[30:01] but i really just want to stick with
[30:04] bathsheba and look at it from the angle
[30:05] of bathsheba amen
[30:07] at the angle of the gentile bride amen
[30:09] because you could go on david's side and
[30:11] talk about all the failure and
[30:12] everything and the repentance and i
[30:13] don't really want to labor in that
[30:14] you could preach a whole series that way
[30:16] but i'm just looking at the angle from
[30:18] bathsheba
[30:18] so that we can understand this second
[30:22] samuel 3 and 2.
[30:26] now we're going to start now as david is
[30:29] the king
[30:30] but david's kingdom didn't start off as
[30:32] him being king of the entire nation of
[30:34] israel it started off with him being
[30:36] king of the southern tribes he's king of
[30:38] judah and benjamin
[30:39] amen but later on the the the ten
[30:42] kingdoms would align with the southern
[30:44] two
[30:44] and it would become one nation one
[30:46] kingdom and david would become king of
[30:48] them
[30:49] so until that happened he starts off
[30:51] ruling out of hebron
[30:52] and he rules in hebron for seven years
[30:55] we look at this in verse two
[30:57] and unto david were sons born in hebron
[31:00] and his firstborn was
[31:01] abnon of uh a high nome
[31:05] the jezreelitis and the second chileab
[31:08] of abigail the wife of nabal
[31:10] the carmelite and the third absalom the
[31:12] son of
[31:13] mekka the daughter of taumaya taumaya
[31:16] king of gesher and the fourth adonijah
[31:19] the son of hageth
[31:20] and the fifth shafatiyai the son of
[31:24] abbatol the sixth ethereum by igla
[31:28] david's wife these were born to david in
[31:30] hebron
[31:32] so now we find out that while he's king
[31:35] and hebron before the kingdom is united
[31:36] he has six sons
[31:38] this is going to be important as we go
[31:39] through the story to understand in
[31:41] hebrew and he has six sons
[31:42] but after the kingdom's united he moves
[31:44] from hebron into jerusalem
[31:46] and when the kingdom's united he
[31:48] established the kingdom in jerusalem in
[31:50] jerusalem as the capital
[31:52] and those are going to be sons born
[31:53] later so there was six sons born
[31:56] but the seventh sons not born in hebron
[31:58] amen we've got to transfer over to
[32:00] jerusalem now
[32:02] this will get good samuel chapter 5.
[32:06] keep your bibles handy because we've got
[32:08] a lot of scriptures to go through today
[32:11] samuel chapter 5.
[32:15] verse 4 david was 30 years old when he
[32:17] began to reign
[32:18] and he reigned 40 years in hebron he
[32:21] reigned over judah seven years and six
[32:23] months
[32:23] and in judah in jerusalem he he reigned
[32:26] 30 and three years over all israel
[32:28] and judah so
[32:32] this is this is important to note
[32:35] that he's got seven years so he
[32:36] completes a seven year cycle
[32:40] in hebron and at the in the seven year
[32:42] cycle
[32:43] he produces six sons but after he's
[32:45] finished the seven year cycle
[32:47] he's going to move into jerusalem and in
[32:50] jerusalem
[32:51] there's now going to be more sons born
[32:53] and that's what we're going to look at
[32:55] so all of this gets very interesting i
[32:56] think if it all of our understanding
[32:59] comes from what brother brenham taught
[33:01] us in the seals
[33:03] it teaches us through the opening of
[33:04] word through the church age he starts to
[33:05] teach us
[33:06] seven church ages three pools four
[33:08] anointings four stages of restoration
[33:11] he starts to teach us all of this and
[33:13] once once he opens our eyes and we can
[33:15] see the plan of redemption through this
[33:17] then you go back and through to read the
[33:18] bible and it's like it's there and it's
[33:20] there
[33:20] and it's like why seven years in hebrew
[33:22] why six sons
[33:26] you can only understand it when you
[33:28] understand the seals
[33:30] it only makes sense through the picture
[33:32] of the opening of the seal so god can
[33:34] explain
[33:35] how he's been redeeming who he's been
[33:36] redeeming the method of redeeming amen
[33:38] and he starts to show these things in
[33:40] these cycles
[33:42] so now let's jump over to verse
[33:50] 11.
[33:53] samuel 11-1
[33:57] second samuel sorry second samuel
[34:00] chapter 11
[34:01] verse 1.
[34:09] and it came to pass after the year was
[34:11] expired at the time when kings go forth
[34:13] the battle
[34:14] that david sent joab and his servants
[34:16] with him in all israel
[34:17] and they destroyed the children of amman
[34:20] and besieged reba
[34:21] but david tarried still at jerusalem and
[34:24] it came to pass in the evening time that
[34:26] david arose from off his bed and walked
[34:28] upon the roof of his king's house
[34:30] and from the roof he saw a woman washing
[34:32] herself and the woman was very beautiful
[34:35] to look upon
[34:36] and david sent and inquired after the
[34:38] woman and one said is not this bathsheba
[34:41] the daughter of ilyam the wife of uriah
[34:43] the hittite
[34:44] and david sent messengers and took her
[34:46] and she came in unto him and he lay with
[34:48] her for she was purified from her
[34:50] uncleanness
[34:51] and she returned into her house and the
[34:53] woman conceived
[34:54] and sent and told david and said i am
[34:57] with child.
[34:59] so remember i'm just going to look at
[35:01] the angle from bathsheba i'm not going
[35:03] to try
[35:03] try not to look too much from david's
[35:05] view but from bathsheba's
[35:07] and now this is a woman who is married
[35:10] to a hittite
[35:11] and hittites are gentiles and now she's
[35:13] the wife of uriah the hittite
[35:15] who's a warrior in david's army and he's
[35:17] off fighting an army for
[35:18] fighting in a war for david but brother
[35:21] brahm says in the message of grace
[35:23] in in paragraph 112 he says now how
[35:26] could david take uriah's wife the
[35:28] beautiful bathsheba
[35:29] when he had 500 of his own but seeing
[35:32] her taking a bath
[35:33] and there's the negligence now she just
[35:35] forgot to pull the shades down when she
[35:37] was taking her bath
[35:38] and knowed that the king made a trip
[35:41] there by their every day down over the
[35:43] wall
[35:44] so brother branham's showing us another
[35:45] angle to the story
[35:47] we may not have always known is that
[35:49] bathsheba
[35:50] knew that the king took a walk there and
[35:52] she didn't pull the shades
[35:54] that's a modern way of explaining what
[35:56] brother branham is trying to explain
[35:58] that she was negligent in keeping
[36:00] herself hid from the king
[36:02] knowing that he walked there every day
[36:05] and he goes on in paragraph 117 he says
[36:07] bathsheba done wrong just like eve done
[36:10] wrong
[36:11] but adam was included in it brother
[36:13] ben's not excluding david david's guilty
[36:15] very very very guilty but he's trying to
[36:17] show us
[36:18] that bathsheba done wrong like eve done
[36:20] wrong
[36:21] amen and this is very very important
[36:24] because
[36:25] brother bram says in the invisible union
[36:27] of the bride of christ in 1965
[36:29] said if you've united to christ
[36:31] instilled married to a denomination
[36:33] you're an adulteress you're a laodicea
[36:37] so so bathsheba even though this was the
[36:40] king of israel and even though the king
[36:42] of israel sent for her
[36:43] and even though amen you would think
[36:45] he's an authority and i have no choice
[36:47] amen
[36:48] but she had a choice she was negligent
[36:50] when she didn't pull the shade
[36:53] her husband was away in battle amen and
[36:56] brotherhood said she done wrong
[36:57] and because we're looking at her as the
[37:00] church we're looking at bathsheba at the
[37:02] church
[37:02] if you're united to christ christ who
[37:04] the king if you're united to christ and
[37:07] still
[37:07] married to a denomination to the hittite
[37:10] you're an adulteress you're a laodicea
[37:16] and so here she is now bathsheba even
[37:19] though it was the king
[37:20] even though it was a good king even
[37:23] though it was the king over israel even
[37:25] though he's a prophet
[37:27] amen and he's a spiritual leader and
[37:28] he's a great man
[37:30] amen she still could not go to him
[37:33] until her first husband dead
[37:37] now let's go over to romans chapter
[37:39] seven and pick this up
[37:41] and just read a couple scriptures here
[37:42] in romans
[37:47] romans the seventh chapter
[38:00] verse one now you know you not brethren
[38:03] for i speak to them that know the law
[38:05] how that the law hath dominion over a
[38:07] woman as long
[38:08] as he liveth a man has sorry the law
[38:11] hath dominion over a man as long as he
[38:13] liveth
[38:14] for the woman which hath a husband is
[38:16] bound by the law
[38:17] to her husband so long as he liveth but
[38:19] if the husband be dead she is loosed
[38:21] from the law of her husband
[38:23] so then if while her husband liveth she
[38:25] be married to another man
[38:27] she shall be called an adulteress but if
[38:30] her husband be dead
[38:31] she is free from the law so that she is
[38:33] no adulteress though she'd be married
[38:35] to another man
[38:38] you see if that was all i wonder yeah so
[38:41] brother brown takes this and he picks
[38:42] this up in the invisible union in other
[38:44] places and begins to show
[38:46] that you cannot be married to a
[38:47] denomination and married to christ at
[38:49] the same time
[38:50] that's adultery now christ is the right
[38:53] king he's the right man
[38:54] he's the right one he's the goal and
[38:57] only he can bring forth the right son
[39:00] but until that old hit tight system is
[39:03] dead
[39:04] until the old husband is dead amen if
[39:07] she would go
[39:08] to him she is considered an adulteress
[39:12] hallelujah so now we're looking at the
[39:15] church
[39:17] so now we we know this plan and we're
[39:19] not going to go and read into all of
[39:20] this in detail but
[39:22] david comes up with a plan he tries to
[39:24] bring your uriah back and
[39:25] and he starts to bring uriah back with a
[39:27] report from joab so he can get
[39:29] uriah to go home so that he can lie with
[39:31] his wife so there can be a baby born and
[39:33] he's trying to cover up his sin
[39:34] and uriah is more honorable at this
[39:37] point than david
[39:39] brother said some wonderful things about
[39:41] uriah he said i can't wait to get over
[39:42] there and shake his hand
[39:45] because he said how can i go and eat my
[39:48] food and lie with my wife in the comfort
[39:50] of my bed
[39:50] when the ark of the covenant when the
[39:52] word and the and the lord's army is out
[39:54] there fighting a battle
[39:56] brother said oh i'd like to shake his
[39:58] hand hallelujah
[40:01] so hey amen the uriah the hittite is not
[40:04] some old evil wicked nasty guy
[40:06] that runs and operates a bar somewhere
[40:09] or a strip
[40:10] house amen he's a he's a righteous man
[40:12] he's a notable man
[40:13] amen he wants to do right yes
[40:18] sometimes we've got to be careful we
[40:21] think we think the wrong in the heir
[40:24] or the wrong husband or the wrong
[40:26] marriage we we think it's
[40:27] we think it's so nasty and so dirty and
[40:30] so
[40:31] but sometimes it looks really good
[40:34] we got to be really careful sometimes
[40:37] deception is so close not miles away but
[40:41] deception is so
[40:42] close that it looks really good
[40:45] so now david works this scheme and uriah
[40:49] is righteous and will not will not
[40:53] give up on us on his countrymen he will
[40:55] not give up on the ark of the lord
[40:57] and so david sends him back out with
[40:58] another plan tells joab
[41:00] send him in where the battles hot back
[41:02] off of him and let him be killed
[41:04] and so uriah is killed and we're going
[41:06] to pick up the story here
[41:08] in verse 26
[41:12] chapter 11 verse 26.
[41:17] and when the wife of uriah heard that
[41:18] uriah her husband was dead she
[41:20] mourned for her husband and when the
[41:23] morning was passed david sent and
[41:24] fetched her to his house and she became
[41:26] his wife
[41:27] and bear him a son but the thing that
[41:29] david had done
[41:30] displeased the lord so
[41:34] so uriah dies she mourns
[41:37] and as soon as her morning is done he
[41:39] brings her in he marries her
[41:41] becomes his wife and she bears a son
[41:44] this is the son that was conceived out
[41:46] of wedlock
[41:47] and but the thing that david had done
[41:49] displeased the lord
[41:51] in verse 12 or chapter 12 verse 1 and
[41:53] the lord sent nathan unto david and he
[41:56] and he came unto him and said unto him
[41:58] there were two men in one city
[41:59] the one rich and the other poor we were
[42:01] very familiar with the story where
[42:03] where the rich man has lots of lambs
[42:05] amen lots of sheep but there was one
[42:07] poor little man only had one and
[42:09] he went and took his and slayed it and
[42:10] fed his guests and
[42:12] didn't sacrifice any of his own amen and
[42:15] david
[42:15] starts in his righteous indignation
[42:17] starts to pass judgment on this man amen
[42:19] he's going to have to restore
[42:20] he'll he'll be killed or all these other
[42:22] stuff and and
[42:23] nathan looks at david and says you're
[42:25] the man
[42:27] you're the man you had wives and god
[42:28] would have given you more if you asked
[42:30] for them
[42:30] but you took what uriah had
[42:33] and and and i don't really want to focus
[42:36] on david's i'm really trying to focus on
[42:37] the bright side but it's really hard
[42:39] when you get into this
[42:40] this this is really really interesting
[42:43] but we go to chapter
[42:44] 12 down to verse 13 after nathan speaks
[42:46] to david
[42:48] look at verse 13 and david said unto
[42:50] nathan i have sinned
[42:53] against the lord david didn't mince
[42:57] words with his
[42:58] repentance he didn't start popping out
[43:01] excuses but do you know you know
[43:02] i was i i was lonely that night and i
[43:05] had a real stressful day and as i walked
[43:06] by
[43:07] she had left the curtain up on the
[43:08] window he wasn't pointing to anybody
[43:10] else
[43:10] and he wasn't saying you know what i did
[43:12] well you know uriah wasn't really that
[43:14] great of a guy it had nothing to do with
[43:16] uriah he says i've sinned against the
[43:18] lord
[43:20] that brings a real repentance when you
[43:21] recognize who's been harmed
[43:24] and david said unto nathan i have sinned
[43:26] against the lord and nathan said unto
[43:27] david
[43:28] the lord has al lord also hath put away
[43:30] thy sin thou shalt not die
[43:33] boy that took a long time
[43:39] what david did is despicable
[43:42] what david did is reproachable it's
[43:45] never good in any scenario could you
[43:47] ever call what he did good
[43:49] what he did is vile what he did is low
[43:51] down what he did was
[43:52] cowardly not just takes a man's wife
[43:56] when he's out fighting for him
[43:59] amen and she conceives then tries to
[44:01] trap him into it and he would have let
[44:03] uriah believe that was his son the rest
[44:06] of his life
[44:07] dirty rotten tricks amen when that one
[44:09] worked he has the man murdered
[44:13] and so david says i i have sinned
[44:16] against the lord
[44:18] and nathan said he put away your sin
[44:22] there's no rosary beats amen there's no
[44:25] there's no repent there's no
[44:27] making it up to god there's no paying
[44:29] back for what you've done
[44:31] there's no you know after a couple years
[44:33] he'll accept you back or
[44:34] when you go and make this right and make
[44:36] that right and make that right he'll
[44:37] accept you back
[44:38] no he says he's put away your sin
[44:41] [Applause]
[44:42] hallelujah that didn't take very long
[44:44] friends
[44:46] remember brother branham's in the prayer
[44:47] line or i can't remember it's a prayer
[44:49] line or where it was he's talking to a
[44:50] woman
[44:51] and he sees the dream she's walking on
[44:52] white sand and she feels like she's
[44:54] washed away she's away from the lord but
[44:56] she wants to come back
[44:58] and brother bam sees the dream and he
[45:00] talks to her and he says i see the white
[45:01] stands you're walking
[45:02] and you feel like you've washed away but
[45:05] you want to come back
[45:06] is that right she says yes he goes well
[45:08] you're back now
[45:11] hallelujah why this is the seed line
[45:15] this is the one where the lamb was slain
[45:17] before the foundation of the world
[45:19] pointing to when christ would come in a
[45:21] physical manifestation in this dimension
[45:23] and shed physical blood
[45:24] to pay for the price amen and that was
[45:27] already laid down here that principle
[45:29] and now when he repents nathan says he's
[45:31] put away your sin
[45:34] can you imagine for us human beings it
[45:36] doesn't make any sense it's like there's
[45:37] no justice taking place
[45:39] but the justice is the dying lamb
[45:42] [Music]
[45:43] why why would david had to pay a price
[45:47] amen in his repentance why would david
[45:49] have to earn
[45:50] back the putting away of his sins and
[45:53] diminish
[45:54] from the price that was paid by the
[45:56] shedding of the blood
[45:58] so if you add rosary beads and you add
[46:01] works program
[46:02] and you add a season of time where you
[46:04] have to be a good boy before your sins
[46:06] are put away
[46:06] you have taken away from the price that
[46:09] was paid at calvary
[46:11] you have diminished the fact that god
[46:13] had a price paid in his mind before the
[46:15] foundation of the world
[46:16] and knew that he would abolish all the
[46:18] sin
[46:19] amen from adam and eve on because of the
[46:22] price that was paid
[46:24] and it was such a precious price how can
[46:26] you add to the price that means like
[46:28] somebody has paid the tens of thousands
[46:31] of dollars of bail for you and you say
[46:32] well let me help you out i got two
[46:34] pennies here and a nickel
[46:37] it's embarrassing keep your pennies and
[46:39] your nickels
[46:40] there's nothing you can do it's already
[46:42] been paid for
[46:44] don't devalue what's happened by saying
[46:46] well when i act right when i do better
[46:48] when i get in a better position
[46:50] then i'll repent and god will forgive me
[46:52] just give an honest hearted repentance
[46:56] you've washed away but you want to come
[46:58] back is that right yes
[47:00] you're back now oh i'm so glad the
[47:03] prophet didn't say
[47:04] well make sure you're at church every
[47:05] service don't miss a service read and
[47:07] pray and read your bible every day and
[47:09] you just keep giving yourself and
[47:10] someday god will wash away that sin
[47:13] boy if he said anything like that you
[47:15] and i would be in a works program where
[47:17] we keep jumping through the hoops amen
[47:19] and jumping through the hoops
[47:20] never certain if we're okay with god
[47:25] i'm trying not to preach david's side
[47:27] but
[47:30] but there's nothing you can do to pay
[47:34] the price for your sin now
[47:38] there's another side to that it's the
[47:40] chasing hand of the lord
[47:43] now you're going to pay a price for
[47:45] every sin
[47:46] [Applause]
[47:48] so you can never do anything to pay the
[47:51] price for your redemption
[47:54] you can never add to what was paid to be
[47:57] clean and free from sin
[47:59] you can't help him pay
[48:02] but everything you do as a child of god
[48:06] he has a good father will make sure
[48:08] you're chastened and rebuked and you're
[48:10] going to pay for everything you do wrong
[48:13] david did bathsheba did
[48:18] and all of god's children did but that
[48:20] has nothing to do with salvation that
[48:22] has nothing to do with your redemption
[48:26] we've got to draw a sharp line and say
[48:28] you know what if i'm
[48:29] suffering from the consequences of my
[48:31] action that has nothing to do with my
[48:33] salvation
[48:34] nothing to do with my redemption i'm
[48:37] purified by the blood of jesus christ
[48:40] pure clean snow white sinless
[48:43] virtuous spotless bride of jesus christ
[48:47] and some of us are sinless spotless
[48:50] virtuous bride of jesus christ and still
[48:54] suffering under the consequences of our
[48:56] sin
[48:59] how can that be true it's true friends
[49:02] you as a child can be chastened
[49:04] you as a child and a human being there's
[49:06] a law of reaping and sowing
[49:08] and that'll work but that's not attached
[49:10] to your salvation
[49:11] that's not attached to redemption
[49:15] that's only this earthly journey
[49:18] amen and if you have to suffer under the
[49:21] consequences of sin
[49:22] every day in your earthly journey it
[49:24] will not change your destination
[49:28] you may have committed some terrible
[49:31] tragic sins
[49:32] as a young person that you can't erase
[49:36] there are some things that are done in
[49:38] the body you can't erase
[49:40] you can be justified but in this life
[49:42] you can never
[49:43] take back vergency that's been given
[49:45] away
[49:46] there are things that can never be
[49:48] changed in this life
[49:49] but it has nothing to do with the next
[49:52] life
[49:53] it has nothing to do with your sonship
[49:55] or who you are as a daughter of god
[49:57] or the price that was paid or your
[49:58] redemption on calvary it has nothing to
[50:00] do with that
[50:01] that's only this earthly journey
[50:04] so we may be suffering under the
[50:06] consequences but don't let the
[50:07] consequences you're suffering under
[50:09] identify you as a son or daughter of god
[50:12] [Music]
[50:15] amen be careful that if i'm still
[50:18] suffering
[50:18] because of things that i've made done
[50:20] wrong things that i did
[50:22] out of faith and things that i'd done
[50:23] wrong amen if i'm still suffering from
[50:25] that that's not my identity
[50:27] i'm identified with calvary
[50:31] as a redeemed son of god
[50:35] amen sometimes we think
[50:39] 20 years of sin 20 years of paying back
[50:42] that's just the way man does man can
[50:44] only add one and once two
[50:47] but god has a way of multiplying
[50:50] sometimes he can he can he can work us
[50:53] through those
[50:54] consequences we're sin much faster than
[50:56] we could ever imagine
[50:57] we'll just give him our life and just
[50:58] submit to him
[51:01] praise the lord
[51:04] so he says verse 13 again and david said
[51:08] unto nathan i have sinned against the
[51:10] lord
[51:10] and nathan said unto david the lord also
[51:14] also hath put away thy sin that thou
[51:17] shalt not die
[51:18] howbeit because by this deed thou has
[51:21] given great occasion to the enemies of
[51:23] the lord to blaspheme that
[51:25] the child also that is born unto thee
[51:27] shall surely die
[51:30] see there's consequences
[51:34] and nathan departed unto his house and
[51:36] the lord struck the child and uriah's
[51:38] wife bear unto
[51:39] david and it was very sick david
[51:42] therefore besought god for the child and
[51:44] david fasted and went in and lay all
[51:46] night upon the earth
[51:47] and the elders of his house arose and
[51:49] went to him to raise him up from the
[51:51] earth
[51:51] but he would not neither did he eat
[51:53] bread with them
[51:55] and it came to pass on the seventh day
[51:57] that the child died
[52:01] what day the seventh day
[52:05] whenever we start to come across things
[52:07] like this it's like your radar goes up
[52:09] ding ding ding ding ding seventh day
[52:13] he could have died on the six he could
[52:14] die on fourth he could die on the 27th
[52:16] he could have died
[52:17] but he died on the seventh day
[52:21] a child died
[52:25] came to pass on the seventh day that the
[52:27] child died and the servants of david
[52:28] feared to tell him that the child was
[52:30] dead
[52:31] for they said behold while the child was
[52:33] yet alive we spake unto him
[52:35] and he would not hearken unto our voice
[52:38] how will he then
[52:39] vex himself if we tell him that this
[52:41] child is dead
[52:43] but when david saw that his servants
[52:44] whispered david perceived that the child
[52:46] was dead
[52:47] therefore david said unto his servants
[52:50] is the child dead and they said he is
[52:53] dead
[52:54] then david arose from the earth and
[52:56] washed and anointed himself and changed
[52:58] his apparel
[52:59] and came into the house of the lord and
[53:01] worshiped then he came to his own house
[53:03] and and when he required they set bread
[53:06] before him and he did eat
[53:08] then said his servants unto him what
[53:10] thing is this that thou has done
[53:12] thou does fast and weak for the child
[53:14] while it was alive
[53:15] but when the child was dead thou does
[53:18] raise and eat bread
[53:20] and he said while the child was yet
[53:21] alive i fasted and wept for i said
[53:23] who can tell whether god will be
[53:25] gracious to me that the child may live
[53:28] but now he is dead therefore should i
[53:30] fast can i bring him back again
[53:32] i shall go to him but he shall not
[53:34] return to me
[53:37] super interesting passage of scripture
[53:41] now if you study through the bible and
[53:43] you read through
[53:44] you start to see that in hebron there
[53:47] was six sons born and then
[53:48] the kingdoms united and then they moved
[53:50] to jerusalem and in jerusalem
[53:53] you start reading through and there's no
[53:55] record of a son being born till we get
[53:57] to here
[53:59] this is the first place as you read
[54:00] through where a son's being born
[54:03] and and when they begin to number the
[54:05] sons we'll see this later they number
[54:06] the sons of david
[54:07] they number in hebron one two three four
[54:10] five six seven
[54:11] or five six and they tell you this is
[54:12] the fourth and this is the fifth this is
[54:14] the sixth
[54:14] but when they go to the sons of david
[54:16] born in jerusalem they don't number them
[54:18] they don't tell you what birth order
[54:19] they came in or how they came
[54:22] but when you read through the record
[54:23] this is the next child that's born to
[54:25] david
[54:26] that would make this the seventh son
[54:30] and the seventh son is born
[54:33] to bathsheba through adultery
[54:38] and the seventh son dies after it was
[54:41] cursed from nathan
[54:42] on the seventh day do you think this
[54:46] could have anything to do with the
[54:47] seventh church age
[54:51] quite possibly the seventh son
[54:54] dies on the on the seventh day
[54:57] after nathan condemns it and curses him
[55:01] and and so brother branham said it was
[55:04] just a baby the baby died and he prayed
[55:06] for the baby
[55:07] and it died and in the philadelphia and
[55:09] church age out of the church age book
[55:10] he says and not only does this age
[55:12] overflow into the last stage
[55:14] but the last stage is in many respects
[55:16] simply a carrying on of the six age
[55:19] so there's six sons in hebron the
[55:20] seventh age is just kind of a carrying
[55:22] over of the sixth age
[55:24] because something new has to be
[55:26] established after the seven so it's kind
[55:28] of a carrying over into
[55:30] to the sixth age the seventh age listen
[55:32] to this
[55:33] a very short age
[55:38] this baby only lived just a short time
[55:41] the seventh age a very short age gathers
[55:43] up into itself for one quick work
[55:45] all the evil of every age and yet all
[55:47] the reality
[55:49] of pentecost brother ben says in satan's
[55:51] eden the laodicean church age is the
[55:53] pentecostal church days because it's the
[55:55] last church age
[55:59] he says again in jehovah jireh we
[56:01] realize that the pentecostal church age
[56:02] in the last day
[56:03] is the laodicean church age so we know
[56:06] that the seventh church age the latest
[56:07] in church
[56:08] is the pentecostal church age here we've
[56:10] come to the seventh son
[56:11] who's going to die on the seventh day
[56:14] and and i want to read out of god's only
[56:16] provided place of worship in 1965
[56:19] so now remember remember how we just
[56:22] went through the church ages
[56:23] the messenger to the church always comes
[56:26] just at the dying of an other church
[56:28] age always the dying of the pentecost
[56:31] brings forth the rapturing of the bride
[56:32] you got that
[56:34] the dying of pentecost brings forth the
[56:36] rapturing the bride now listen close
[56:38] the dying of luther brought forth wesley
[56:40] the dying of wesley brought forth
[56:42] pentecost
[56:42] the dying of pentecost brother bram said
[56:45] brings forth the rapture of the bride
[56:47] but listen what he says now the dying of
[56:49] pentecost
[56:50] brings forth the message now what is the
[56:53] message now
[56:54] it's the rapturing message
[56:58] the dying of pentecost brings forth the
[56:59] message now here it is right here
[57:02] patterned all through the scripture
[57:03] there's not a scripture in the bible but
[57:05] about what hooks write one with the
[57:07] other see all these types
[57:09] i have no education but i have the holy
[57:11] spirit that shows me through another
[57:12] channel
[57:13] that teaches me that from nature and
[57:15] that's by the word
[57:16] has to be the word brings his promise
[57:20] brother says and seed is not air with
[57:22] the shock in 1965
[57:23] that shuck looked more like the seed
[57:25] until more
[57:27] until more than the pollen did and more
[57:29] than the stalk did but they were only
[57:31] carriers of the seed see
[57:32] luther organized the stalk died wesley
[57:35] organized the pollen died
[57:36] pentecost organized the life died
[57:39] and now comes forth the seed
[57:42] you can you can't go any farther than
[57:45] the seed
[57:47] he says in invisible union the bride of
[57:50] christ in 1965 said pentecost dried up
[57:52] and died
[57:53] like luther wesley and the rest of them
[57:55] so brother branham is clear
[57:57] that pentecostal denominational system
[57:59] is dead
[58:01] it died and it died to bring forth the
[58:04] seed
[58:05] it died to bring forth the next stage
[58:07] amen which is back to life again
[58:09] back to the original grain that went in
[58:11] the ground and so now we come
[58:13] amen here that we i want to go back and
[58:16] just read this again
[58:18] because this is the seventh son so an
[58:20] invisible union of the bride of christ
[58:22] he says if you're united to christ and
[58:25] still married to a denomination
[58:26] you're an adulteress you are a laodicea
[58:30] well that's how this seventh son was
[58:33] born
[58:34] she was still married to the hittite
[58:36] amen and then she
[58:37] she united with david and they produced
[58:40] the seventh son
[58:41] and that seven son came that way and now
[58:44] nathan the prophet puts a curse on that
[58:47] son
[58:48] and nathan the prophet once he curses
[58:50] the sign it dies
[58:51] on the seventh day
[58:56] that makes you look and say what comes
[58:58] next i'll tell you what comes next
[58:59] solomon comes next
[59:02] christ comes next after the death of the
[59:04] seventh on the seventh day
[59:06] makes way for solomon to come
[59:10] hallelujah praise be to god this bible
[59:13] is perfect
[59:16] now i want to be careful
[59:19] with with a scripture let's go back and
[59:23] read
[59:24] second samuel chapter 12.
[59:35] verse 23 322
[59:39] 22-23 and he said while the child was
[59:42] yet alive i fasted and wept for i said
[59:44] who can tell whether god will be
[59:46] gracious to me that the child may live
[59:49] but now he is dead wherefore shall
[59:52] should i fast can i bring him back again
[59:55] i shall go to him
[59:58] key words i shall go to him
[1:00:01] but he shall not return to me
[1:00:06] that baby wasn't lost
[1:00:10] and the true pentecost in the
[1:00:11] pentecostal age wasn't lost
[1:00:13] either that pentecost organization
[1:00:17] died to make way for solomon but those
[1:00:19] who were born again
[1:00:21] under that under that dispensation
[1:00:23] they're
[1:00:24] fine because david says hey he can't
[1:00:26] come back to me but i'm going to go to
[1:00:28] him
[1:00:28] who's david a seed of god and wherever
[1:00:31] david goes after he dies
[1:00:32] is abraham's bosom amen and that's the
[1:00:35] place of safety that's of salvation
[1:00:37] proving that that child that died wasn't
[1:00:39] lost it was saved
[1:00:42] brother brown tells us the same thing
[1:00:44] amen in in questions and answers in 61
[1:00:47] he's talking about saul when saul brings
[1:00:49] up samuel through the witch of endor and
[1:00:51] samuel begins to speak to him
[1:00:53] says he told him the word of the lord
[1:00:55] said tomorrow you're going to fall in
[1:00:57] the battle and jonathan your son is
[1:00:58] going to fall with you
[1:01:00] and he said by this time tomorrow night
[1:01:02] you'll be with me
[1:01:05] if he was lost so was samuel the prophet
[1:01:09] that's fundamentalism you can see why
[1:01:11] it's so called see
[1:01:12] you'll be with me tomorrow night by this
[1:01:14] time see then if saul was lost so was
[1:01:16] samuel
[1:01:17] because they was both in the same place
[1:01:20] and you look at saul's life as a king
[1:01:22] who was disobedient to the prophet
[1:01:24] this would be into the word of god
[1:01:25] rebellious and wicked amen
[1:01:27] but he was part of that registry in the
[1:01:29] lamb's book of life amen and when he
[1:01:32] died he went to the same resting place
[1:01:34] that samuel went to and brother bam said
[1:01:36] if saul is lost then samuel's lost
[1:01:41] because they would have went to the
[1:01:42] regions of the lost not unto abraham's
[1:01:44] bosom
[1:01:46] so now when david says amen he's fasting
[1:01:49] amen what's he trying to do
[1:01:51] he wants god to save this seventh son
[1:01:56] he wants god to save amen in the seven
[1:01:59] day period
[1:02:00] he wants them to be saved be saved be
[1:02:03] saved amen keep him alive
[1:02:04] but god takes him anyways and that that
[1:02:07] that pentecostal age
[1:02:08] dies out amen and he realizes after it
[1:02:12] dies
[1:02:12] amen everything's going to be okay i
[1:02:15] thought while it was alive it could be
[1:02:17] saved but now that it's dead i can't
[1:02:19] bring it
[1:02:20] back from the dead but one day i will go
[1:02:22] to it
[1:02:24] proving that it was saved
[1:02:27] hallelujah friends this bible is perfect
[1:02:32] the seven days is really just a
[1:02:33] continuation of the six six sons born
[1:02:35] moving to jerusalem now there's another
[1:02:38] son born
[1:02:39] and is born by bathsheba but it's born
[1:02:41] the wrong way because the denominational
[1:02:43] idea hadn't died yet
[1:02:45] because pentecost denominated
[1:02:49] but something's going to change
[1:02:53] david had already taken her to be his
[1:02:55] wife and the child was born
[1:02:57] nathan exposed the sin he repented
[1:03:00] sins were washed away but the baby was
[1:03:02] cursed and on the seventh day
[1:03:04] the baby dies after the baby dies
[1:03:08] look what the scripture says next
[1:03:12] verse 24 and david comforted bathsheba
[1:03:16] his wife and went in under her
[1:03:18] and lay with her and she bear a son and
[1:03:21] he called his name solomon and the lord
[1:03:24] loved him
[1:03:27] you have to say how how
[1:03:31] can you imagine reading this with no
[1:03:33] understanding of the message
[1:03:35] you've never heard brother branham
[1:03:36] preach before you have no idea
[1:03:39] amen and you read through this and you
[1:03:42] just read through
[1:03:44] you just read through adultery
[1:03:47] betrayal lies
[1:03:51] deception and murder
[1:03:55] and then the baby that was born through
[1:03:57] that is is stricken by the lord and he
[1:04:00] dies
[1:04:01] and the very next thing that happens is
[1:04:04] that david goes into bathsheba only this
[1:04:06] time bathsheba's condition is changed
[1:04:10] something's different about bathsheba
[1:04:12] now
[1:04:13] bathsheba is not married to the
[1:04:15] denomination anymore
[1:04:18] the hittite is now dead
[1:04:22] and now when he goes in to comfort her
[1:04:25] after the death of the seventh son
[1:04:27] now when david goes in now now she's
[1:04:30] his wife they've been
[1:04:33] joined in a union and now he goes into
[1:04:37] her to comfort her
[1:04:38] at the death of this son and she
[1:04:40] conceives and brings more
[1:04:42] solomon and the wording here is
[1:04:44] beautiful and he called his name solomon
[1:04:47] and the lord loved him
[1:04:52] hallelujah that makes solomon the eighth
[1:04:55] son
[1:04:57] and he's born in jerusalem not in hebron
[1:05:01] the first living son in jerusalem
[1:05:04] back to the capital again
[1:05:08] verse 25 and he sent now this is the
[1:05:10] lord
[1:05:11] and the lord and he sent by the hand of
[1:05:13] nathan the prophet
[1:05:14] and called his name jedediah
[1:05:18] because of the lord and the word
[1:05:20] jedediah means beloved
[1:05:22] of jehovah so he gives him the name
[1:05:25] solomon which means peace
[1:05:27] amen that's what david gives him the
[1:05:28] name solomon we're going to find out
[1:05:30] that actually that name came from the
[1:05:31] lord himself
[1:05:32] he calls him solomon and the lord loved
[1:05:34] him and he sent nathan the prophet
[1:05:36] the same prophet that cursed the seventh
[1:05:38] son and called for the destruction of
[1:05:40] the seventh son
[1:05:41] is the same one that's giving the name
[1:05:43] to the eighth son
[1:05:45] and saying beloved of jehovah
[1:05:49] the same one that condemns the seventh
[1:05:51] age and condemns the pentecostal age
[1:05:53] is the same one who points amen amen to
[1:05:56] the bride and says this is his beloved
[1:06:01] amen so the same prophet comes along and
[1:06:04] says
[1:06:04] his name is jedediah and the lord sends
[1:06:06] him to call his name
[1:06:07] jedediah which means beloved
[1:06:10] of jehovah hallelujah
[1:06:16] and what's important to the story to me
[1:06:18] what what makes the biggest impact
[1:06:20] is when you know who solomon is solomon
[1:06:23] is not another son
[1:06:24] it's not like oh yeah god was good to me
[1:06:26] had another son no this is solomon
[1:06:29] this is not another of of many sons that
[1:06:31] are named that you'll never remember
[1:06:32] their name
[1:06:33] this is solomon amen solomon's the one
[1:06:35] who's going to come to the throne
[1:06:37] solomon's the one who's going to build
[1:06:39] the temple solomon's the one who's going
[1:06:40] to further establish the kingdom
[1:06:42] and bring israel to their golden age to
[1:06:44] their type of a millennium
[1:06:46] when they have peace all around the
[1:06:47] enemies are paying tribute to them
[1:06:49] they're the most respected nation in all
[1:06:51] the world amen
[1:06:52] they've got a ruler who has the greatest
[1:06:55] wisdom of any man who's ever been alive
[1:06:57] perfectly portraying jesus christ that's
[1:06:59] who was born
[1:07:02] when when the seventh one dies on the
[1:07:04] seventh day
[1:07:07] hallelujah you know what
[1:07:12] we need to take david's approach
[1:07:16] while he was living we tried
[1:07:19] we prayed we fasted but when it's dead
[1:07:23] i can't bring it back we can't bring
[1:07:26] back that pentecostal revival
[1:07:30] we can't bring back the pentecostal age
[1:07:32] so we'll go to them
[1:07:34] absolutely we'll go to them they can't
[1:07:37] come to us
[1:07:39] now let's turn our attention
[1:07:42] to the eighth son
[1:07:46] hallelujah brother branham says in the
[1:07:49] queen of queen of the south god raised
[1:07:51] solomon up as a type of christ
[1:07:53] son of david and gave him a gift
[1:07:56] solomon had many titles he was the son
[1:07:58] of son of david
[1:07:59] he was also the son of god god said
[1:08:02] he'll be my
[1:08:03] he'll be my son and i'll be his father
[1:08:05] son of david
[1:08:06] son of god the prince of peace
[1:08:09] his name is peace perfect type of christ
[1:08:13] scriptural sign of the time in 1964 he
[1:08:16] says god gave solomon a gift and all the
[1:08:18] whole church everybody believed it that
[1:08:20] was a millennium for the jews
[1:08:22] that was the old testament millennium in
[1:08:23] the days of solomon
[1:08:25] a foreshadow of the millennium to come
[1:08:27] the golden age of the jews
[1:08:30] he says in proving his word 1964 we
[1:08:33] think of him
[1:08:34] of this solomon in the great millennium
[1:08:36] of the jews that when
[1:08:38] no nation dared to touch them and that
[1:08:40] great gift of god was in the prophet
[1:08:41] till he made known to the queen
[1:08:43] all her secrets of her heart nothing was
[1:08:45] withheld
[1:08:46] the great age showing and typing that
[1:08:49] there was a great age coming hallelujah
[1:08:52] so we know solomon is critical
[1:08:58] now
[1:09:01] i want to look at another picture here
[1:09:04] of solomon
[1:09:05] and then i want to jump back to this
[1:09:08] there's some strange wording when you
[1:09:10] get into the bible
[1:09:12] concerning the sons that were born in
[1:09:14] jerusalem
[1:09:15] so let's look at this if we could go to
[1:09:17] this in
[1:09:19] second samuel chapter five
[1:09:25] verse 13.
[1:09:33] says verse 13 and david took him more
[1:09:35] concubines and wives out of jerusalem
[1:09:37] after he was come from hebron and they
[1:09:39] were yet sons and daughters born to
[1:09:40] david
[1:09:41] and these be the names of those that
[1:09:43] were born unto him in jerusalem
[1:09:46] shamu and shobab and nathan and solomon
[1:09:50] evil were also an elishua in nephi and
[1:09:54] jafia and alishama and the liada
[1:09:58] and elephalete so these are the names
[1:10:01] but it's interesting that
[1:10:03] that solomon is named number four
[1:10:06] now the bible doesn't say he's number
[1:10:08] four when he goes to number the first
[1:10:11] six he said the first one was the second
[1:10:12] one was
[1:10:13] here he's just naming them but he shows
[1:10:15] up in the fourth spot
[1:10:16] so let's go over to first chronicles
[1:10:18] chapter 3
[1:10:21] and look at this again
[1:10:24] see first thing you have to do is you
[1:10:26] have to say the bible makes no mistakes
[1:10:29] rule number one the bible makes no
[1:10:30] mistakes
[1:10:32] first chronicles chapter three
[1:10:42] verse one first chronicles 3 and 1. now
[1:10:45] these were the sons of david which were
[1:10:47] born
[1:10:47] unto him in hebron the firstborn now
[1:10:50] watch how specific this is
[1:10:52] the firstborn amnon of ahinoam and the
[1:10:55] jezreelite is the second daniel
[1:10:57] of abigail the carmelitis the third
[1:11:00] absalom the son of
[1:11:01] maecha and the daughter of taume tamaya
[1:11:04] king of gisher
[1:11:06] goes all the way through the fifth the
[1:11:07] sixth verse four these six were born
[1:11:10] unto him in hebron
[1:11:11] and there he reigned seven years in six
[1:11:13] months
[1:11:15] in jerusalem he reigned 30 in three
[1:11:17] years
[1:11:18] and these were born unto him in
[1:11:20] jerusalem shamia and shobhab and nathan
[1:11:23] in solomon 4
[1:11:24] of bathsheba the daughter of amiel so
[1:11:27] now you look you look here
[1:11:29] in the first six we name them in order
[1:11:32] number one
[1:11:33] number two number three number four
[1:11:36] number five
[1:11:36] number six then he goes to jerusalem and
[1:11:39] he says
[1:11:40] now here's the sons that were born in
[1:11:41] jerusalem and we name four and he says
[1:11:43] the four of bathsheba
[1:11:45] so all four of these sons come from
[1:11:46] bathsheba
[1:11:49] but solomon's listed fourth and the
[1:11:52] question is that solomon iv born
[1:11:55] ain't no way in the world because
[1:11:58] because he went in under her when she
[1:12:00] was married to the hittite
[1:12:02] that baby was born when her husband was
[1:12:05] killed he took her to wife the baby was
[1:12:06] born
[1:12:07] nathan comes and says the baby's born it
[1:12:10] dies
[1:12:10] when the baby dies he goes in to comfort
[1:12:13] his wife when the baby dies
[1:12:15] and conceives and brings forth solomon
[1:12:18] amen solomon is the eighth born son
[1:12:22] solomon is the second son of bathsheba
[1:12:24] the first one
[1:12:25] that was legitimate
[1:12:28] so why why does the bible do this
[1:12:31] because it goes through and it lists
[1:12:32] more sons but these
[1:12:33] are not in order of birth order these
[1:12:36] are just
[1:12:37] sons they just listed the other in in
[1:12:40] verse
[1:12:42] 3 after he listens to the four of
[1:12:43] bathsheba and verse six
[1:12:45] lists nine other and it says verse eight
[1:12:48] and elisha
[1:12:51] these were all the sons of david beside
[1:12:53] the son of concubines and tamar their
[1:12:55] sister so it doesn't even name the sons
[1:12:57] of his concubines
[1:12:59] so these are the sons that were born so
[1:13:00] he gets to jerusalem
[1:13:02] and he quits putting them in order he
[1:13:04] just says these four
[1:13:05] are of bathsheba the rest of these are
[1:13:07] another nine that was born doesn't even
[1:13:09] mention their mothers
[1:13:12] so there's something that's interesting
[1:13:14] laying here every time the bible does
[1:13:15] this it fascinates me
[1:13:18] it's like it doesn't say he's the fourth
[1:13:20] and nowhere says he's the fourth born of
[1:13:22] bathsheba
[1:13:23] it's evident that he's the second born
[1:13:26] the first legitimate son that's born
[1:13:28] solomon so why forth
[1:13:31] well let's go back to the seals
[1:13:34] why would solomon be listed forth in the
[1:13:37] seals
[1:13:38] because he's revealed under the fourth
[1:13:40] seal as the eagle anointing
[1:13:41] to combat the antichrist because under
[1:13:44] four stages the antichrist
[1:13:46] under four horse riders the antichrist
[1:13:48] comes amen to be incarnate and a pope
[1:13:51] amen to take authority upon the earth
[1:13:53] and then
[1:13:54] he is destroyed the earth is destroyed
[1:13:57] and then the solomon type christ comes
[1:13:59] to set up his kingdom
[1:14:02] to destroy the fourth stage of the
[1:14:04] antichrist amen
[1:14:05] threw four anointings through four
[1:14:07] stages in the church ages
[1:14:10] so he's listen to his fourth because
[1:14:11] four is the number of deliverance
[1:14:14] four is the number of judah i mean all
[1:14:17] through it's like why
[1:14:18] does he so specific specific and then
[1:14:20] there's a total change in language when
[1:14:22] he gets to jerusalem
[1:14:23] and now we're not even saying who was
[1:14:24] first and who was second now we're just
[1:14:26] saying this fourth and now he's listed
[1:14:27] fourth but he's not the fourth
[1:14:31] because he's the deliverer that's why
[1:14:33] because he's the type of christ
[1:14:35] because we know through the church ages
[1:14:37] that there's four stages back to the
[1:14:38] seed again
[1:14:40] what does that seed do that's the seed
[1:14:42] that's going to sit on david's throne
[1:14:45] hallelujah i want to look at first kings
[1:14:53] first kings
[1:14:59] chapter one let's go to chapter one
[1:15:03] this is where you get into bible study
[1:15:04] and this is what i love
[1:15:07] when you start to see god put all the
[1:15:09] puzzle pieces down
[1:15:10] and all sudden click click click click
[1:15:12] click
[1:15:14] it starts to fall into place first kings
[1:15:16] one and five
[1:15:19] well certain first kings one verse one
[1:15:23] now king david was old and stricken in
[1:15:25] years and they covered him with clothes
[1:15:26] but he had no heat
[1:15:28] so david is getting old he's coming to
[1:15:30] the point of dying
[1:15:31] he's almost to death and now there's
[1:15:33] time for a change in dispensation
[1:15:37] so in verse five if we skip down to
[1:15:38] verse five then
[1:15:40] adenija the son of haggath exalted
[1:15:42] himself saying
[1:15:44] i will be king and he prepared him
[1:15:45] chariots and horsemen and
[1:15:47] fifty men to run before him and his
[1:15:49] father had not displeased him at any
[1:15:51] time and
[1:15:52] saying why hast thou done so and he also
[1:15:54] was a very
[1:15:55] goodly man and his mother bare him after
[1:15:58] absalom
[1:15:59] and he conferred with joab the son of
[1:16:01] zariah
[1:16:02] and with abe athar the priest and they
[1:16:05] followed adonijah helping him
[1:16:07] but zodak the priest and bania the son
[1:16:09] of jehoiadan nathan the prophet and
[1:16:11] shemia and riya
[1:16:12] and the mighty men which belonged to
[1:16:14] david were not with adonisia
[1:16:17] and adonai just slew sheep and oxen in
[1:16:19] fat cattle by the stone
[1:16:21] of zoheleth which is by enrogl
[1:16:24] and called all his brethren the king's
[1:16:26] sons and all the men of judah
[1:16:28] the king's servants so now as
[1:16:31] david's diminishing he's very old and
[1:16:34] they're covering him with clothes he can
[1:16:36] no longer get heat he's at the point of
[1:16:38] dying
[1:16:38] amen now adonai just steps in and
[1:16:41] and it says he exalted himself
[1:16:46] now right there is a huge clue this lets
[1:16:49] you know
[1:16:49] this is antichrist this is the nature of
[1:16:53] lucifer who exalted
[1:16:54] himself amen so adonijah exalted himself
[1:16:58] his father never put him in that
[1:17:00] position
[1:17:00] he was never exalted by somebody else
[1:17:02] but he exalted himself
[1:17:05] now if you go back and read where we
[1:17:07] just read in
[1:17:08] in second samuel and chronicles you'll
[1:17:10] find out adonijah
[1:17:12] is the fourth son of david born in
[1:17:16] hebron
[1:17:18] what's important about that because the
[1:17:20] antichrist takes the throne in the
[1:17:21] fourth stage on the pale horse
[1:17:24] not the first first amnon amen he
[1:17:28] he he raped his sister amen and
[1:17:31] and absalom killed him then absalom was
[1:17:33] killed by joab
[1:17:34] we don't know what happened to the
[1:17:35] second son he's never mentioned again
[1:17:37] only we know that it comes from abigail
[1:17:38] and he was named like his father
[1:17:42] but then you don't hear anything else
[1:17:43] amen but then we come to the fourth born
[1:17:46] son
[1:17:47] adenisia and adenija the antichrist
[1:17:50] exalts himself
[1:17:52] how do we know these antichrists he's
[1:17:53] trying to take the throne before solomon
[1:17:55] can get there
[1:17:57] and the antichrist is trying to take the
[1:17:59] throne of satan's eden before christ can
[1:18:01] get there
[1:18:02] but he's going to be destroyed and
[1:18:03] solomon's coming to the throne
[1:18:05] and that's what this whole story tells
[1:18:07] us that he's going to be destroyed in
[1:18:08] solomon's coming to the throne
[1:18:10] so now it's it's the battle of the force
[1:18:15] now it's the fourth son of david the
[1:18:17] fourth stage of the antichrist spirit
[1:18:19] amen the antichrist now the fourth son
[1:18:23] mentioned solomon is going to come
[1:18:26] and there's going to be a combat a
[1:18:28] showdown and solomon's going to win the
[1:18:29] throne and adonis is going to lose it
[1:18:32] see the seals tell us all these quirky
[1:18:35] things in the bible
[1:18:36] are there laying there because brother
[1:18:39] branham is the one who unlocked
[1:18:41] and through him christ unlocked through
[1:18:42] that ministry the entire bible
[1:18:48] now we go to chapter 1 verse 15.
[1:18:54] nathan the prophet now comes the
[1:18:56] bathsheba
[1:18:57] this is the interesting part to me adam
[1:19:00] nice has exalted himself he's taken the
[1:19:02] throne
[1:19:03] and it says he was a very goodly man
[1:19:07] and and his mother's name means festive
[1:19:12] and he's taking it by deceit now he's
[1:19:14] coming in
[1:19:15] and he's slaying oxen and he's fighting
[1:19:18] everybody
[1:19:18] and he's feeding everybody it's a great
[1:19:21] big party
[1:19:22] everything's going to be wonderful here
[1:19:23] comes a man of peace
[1:19:25] i'm going to bless you but solomon is a
[1:19:28] man of judgment that's going to rid the
[1:19:30] church of all the spirits
[1:19:33] but adonis is a very goodly man he
[1:19:36] exalts himself
[1:19:37] amen and he begins to have a big feast
[1:19:39] and they're going to party
[1:19:40] and everything's going to be fine join
[1:19:43] with me i'll feed you i'll bless you
[1:19:45] everything's going to be okay under the
[1:19:47] beast system
[1:19:49] we're going to unite and it's all going
[1:19:50] to be fine under the beast system
[1:19:54] hallelujah solomon is sitting there
[1:19:57] quietly
[1:19:57] solomon's there he wasn't invited to the
[1:20:00] feast but solomon was there and
[1:20:01] solomon's an adult
[1:20:02] at this point and solomon's sitting
[1:20:05] there and he doesn't say anything
[1:20:07] but nathan the prophet comes to
[1:20:09] bathsheba
[1:20:11] now we come back to the prophet and the
[1:20:12] bride again
[1:20:15] and the prophet comes to bathsheba and
[1:20:17] says don't you have a promise from the
[1:20:20] king
[1:20:23] don't you have a promise that solomon's
[1:20:26] going to sit on his throne
[1:20:28] the prophet comes to remind bathsheba
[1:20:32] of her promise
[1:20:35] bathsheba no doubt had heard what elijah
[1:20:38] had done no doubt it was the talk of the
[1:20:40] kingdom and she may not have known what
[1:20:41] to do about it what can i do
[1:20:43] i don't know what to do but nathan the
[1:20:45] prophet comes along to remind her
[1:20:47] the the king has given you a promise and
[1:20:50] promised the thing that you bore forth
[1:20:53] is the thing that's going to sit on the
[1:20:54] throne
[1:20:58] amen and so now he tells her
[1:21:01] you go to the king and i'll go to the
[1:21:02] king we'll both approach to the king
[1:21:05] so now she comes in verse 15 and
[1:21:07] bathsheba went in unto the king
[1:21:09] into the chamber and the king was very
[1:21:11] old and abide shagged
[1:21:13] ministered unto the king and bathsheba
[1:21:16] bowed and did obey essence unto the king
[1:21:18] and
[1:21:19] the king said what what is thou and she
[1:21:21] said unto him
[1:21:22] my lord thou swearest by the lord thy
[1:21:24] god unto thine handmaid
[1:21:26] now this wasn't just a trivial promise
[1:21:30] he said thou swearest by the lord thy
[1:21:33] god
[1:21:34] unto thine handmaid he had thus
[1:21:38] saith the lord this was not just
[1:21:42] david just saying something just you
[1:21:44] know a sweet little love something i'm
[1:21:46] going to do something special for you
[1:21:48] i i want to buy you a dress no this was
[1:21:51] thus saith the lord kind of promise
[1:21:56] saying assuredly solomon thy son shall
[1:21:59] reign after me
[1:22:00] and he shall sit upon my throne and now
[1:22:03] behold adam niger reigneth and now my
[1:22:05] lord the king
[1:22:06] thou knowest it not and he has slain
[1:22:09] oxen and fat cattle and sheep in
[1:22:10] abundance
[1:22:11] and hath called all the sons of the king
[1:22:14] and a b
[1:22:14] eighth are the priest and job the
[1:22:16] captain of the host but solomon thy
[1:22:18] servant hath he not called
[1:22:20] and thou my lord o king the eyes of all
[1:22:22] israel are upon thee
[1:22:23] that thou should just tell them who
[1:22:25] shall sit on the throne of my lord
[1:22:27] and king after him
[1:22:30] so now it's a silent period
[1:22:34] the king's not saying anything it's kind
[1:22:37] of
[1:22:38] tossed in the air who's going to end up
[1:22:40] ruling this world
[1:22:43] amen and and it looks like it's going to
[1:22:46] adenija
[1:22:48] all indications point is going to
[1:22:50] adonisia
[1:22:52] but there's one problem adenija has
[1:22:55] and then that is that a prophet is going
[1:22:58] to remind the bride of the king
[1:23:00] that she has a promise and she's going
[1:23:04] to go to the king with thus saith the
[1:23:06] lord
[1:23:07] you told me thus saith the lord this
[1:23:09] antichrist is not going to rule amen
[1:23:11] there's going to be a ruler amen it's
[1:23:13] going to be christ
[1:23:17] hallelujah who's had a nicest problem
[1:23:20] adonis
[1:23:20] problem's not solomon because solomon is
[1:23:22] not doing anything the problem is
[1:23:24] bathsheba
[1:23:26] because bathsheba is crying out to the
[1:23:28] king bathsheba is reminding the king
[1:23:30] bathsheba's got thus saith the lord
[1:23:34] hallelujah we're the biggest problem the
[1:23:37] antichrist has
[1:23:39] that's why he can't run amen he can't
[1:23:42] run in his full
[1:23:44] kingdom until this bride is gone he
[1:23:46] can't have his full
[1:23:48] way until this bride is gone amen she's
[1:23:50] holding the thing back right now
[1:23:55] then we we see nathan comes in he tells
[1:23:57] the king the same thing
[1:23:59] we go down to verse 28.
[1:24:02] then king david answered and said call
[1:24:04] me bathsheba
[1:24:06] and she came into the king's presence
[1:24:07] and stood before the king
[1:24:10] and the king swear and said as the lord
[1:24:12] liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of
[1:24:14] all distress
[1:24:15] even as i swear unto thee by the lord
[1:24:18] god of israel saying assuredly solomon
[1:24:20] thy son shall reign after me
[1:24:22] and he shall sit upon my throne in my
[1:24:24] stead even so
[1:24:25] will i certainly do this day then
[1:24:28] bathsheba bowed with her face to the
[1:24:30] earth and did reverence to the king and
[1:24:32] said let
[1:24:33] my lord the king david live forever
[1:24:39] the king's going to keep his word
[1:24:42] now i want to rewind a little bit
[1:24:46] because there's something more amazing
[1:24:48] than all of this
[1:24:50] if we rewind a little bit and we go to
[1:24:53] when
[1:24:53] david now the the kingdom unites
[1:24:57] after his seven years and six months in
[1:24:58] hebron there's a unification of the
[1:25:00] kingdom
[1:25:01] now he moves to jerusalem and he sets up
[1:25:03] the kingdom in jerusalem
[1:25:05] and then he has a desire and in his
[1:25:07] desire he desires to build a house for
[1:25:10] the lord
[1:25:12] this is before bathsheba and solomon
[1:25:16] this is before the incident with
[1:25:17] bathsheba this is after he comes out of
[1:25:19] hebrew and established the kingdom in
[1:25:21] jerusalem
[1:25:22] wants to build a house for the lord and
[1:25:24] there's some interesting things that the
[1:25:25] lord tells him
[1:25:27] so let's look at this in second samuel
[1:25:32] chapter seven
[1:25:36] second samuel chapter seven verse one
[1:25:43] and it came to pass when the king sat in
[1:25:45] his house
[1:25:46] and the lord had given him rest round
[1:25:48] about from all his enemies
[1:25:49] that the king said unto nathan the
[1:25:51] prophet see now i dwell in a house of
[1:25:53] cedar but the ark of the hou
[1:25:55] the ark of god dwelleth within curtains
[1:25:57] and nathan said to the king go
[1:25:59] do all that is in thine heart for the
[1:26:01] lord is with thee
[1:26:02] so nathan said that's a great idea you
[1:26:04] go do it but then the lord tells nathan
[1:26:06] and stops nathan and sends him back and
[1:26:08] tells him not to
[1:26:09] but listen to what he says in verse 12
[1:26:14] and when thy days be fulfilled he's
[1:26:16] speaking to david now
[1:26:17] when thy days be fulfilled and thou
[1:26:19] shalt sleep with thy fathers
[1:26:21] i will set up thy seed after thee which
[1:26:23] shall proceed out of thy bowels
[1:26:25] and i will establish his kingdom he
[1:26:28] shall build a house for my name
[1:26:30] and i will establish the throne of his
[1:26:32] kingdom forever
[1:26:33] and i will be his father and he shall be
[1:26:35] my son if he commit iniquity i will
[1:26:38] chasten him with the rod of men and with
[1:26:39] stripes of the children of men
[1:26:41] but my mercy shall not depart away from
[1:26:43] him as i took it from saul
[1:26:44] when i put away whom i put away before
[1:26:47] thee
[1:26:48] and thine house and thy kingdom shall be
[1:26:51] established forever before thee
[1:26:53] thy throne shall be established forever
[1:26:55] according to all these words and
[1:26:57] according to all this vision
[1:26:59] so did nathan speak unto david
[1:27:02] so he tells david after you depart i'm
[1:27:05] going to rise up a seed in your stead to
[1:27:07] sit on your throne
[1:27:08] and he will build me a house. so there's
[1:27:11] the prophecy
[1:27:12] but when david repeats this same
[1:27:14] prophecy to solomon his son
[1:27:16] let's read how david repeats the
[1:27:18] prophecy
[1:27:19] in first chronicles 22.
[1:27:23] turn over to first chronicles 22.
[1:27:32] this is what made me really happy
[1:27:37] first chronicles 22-6
[1:27:41] but he called for solomon his son and
[1:27:42] charged him to build a house for the
[1:27:44] lord god of israel
[1:27:46] now he's already told him he's going to
[1:27:47] be king he's going to annoy him to be
[1:27:49] king
[1:27:50] and god had already told him through
[1:27:52] nathan the prophet
[1:27:54] the seed that comes up after you shall
[1:27:56] sit on your throne and he shall build me
[1:27:57] a house
[1:27:58] so he begins to tell this same story to
[1:28:00] solomon verse 7 and david said to
[1:28:02] solomon my son
[1:28:04] as for me it was in my mind to build a
[1:28:06] house unto the name of the lord my god
[1:28:09] but the word of the lord came to me
[1:28:10] saying thou has shed blood abundantly
[1:28:12] and has made
[1:28:13] great wars thou shall not build a house
[1:28:16] unto my name because thou has shed much
[1:28:18] blood
[1:28:18] upon the earth in my sight behold a
[1:28:21] son shall be born to thee who shall be a
[1:28:24] man of rest
[1:28:25] and i will give him rest from all his
[1:28:27] enemies round about
[1:28:28] for his name shall be solomon
[1:28:33] amen this is a prophecy before he ever
[1:28:37] commits adultery with bathsheba
[1:28:40] he's saying you'll have a son and his
[1:28:42] name shall be
[1:28:44] solomon and i will give peace and
[1:28:48] quietness unto israel in his days
[1:28:50] he shall build a house for my name and
[1:28:52] he shall be my son
[1:28:54] and i will be his father and i will
[1:28:56] establish the throne of his kingdom
[1:28:58] over israel for ever
[1:29:04] before david committed adultery with
[1:29:08] bathsheba
[1:29:10] was a prophecy went out
[1:29:13] you can't build my house but there'll be
[1:29:14] a seed raised up after me
[1:29:17] and david tells him the lord to him and
[1:29:18] his name shall be
[1:29:20] solomon years later
[1:29:26] david's walking on his wall and he sees
[1:29:29] a beautiful woman
[1:29:31] named bathsheba and he inquires and
[1:29:34] finds out she's married to the hittite
[1:29:37] but in his lust he takes her anyways
[1:29:40] he takes her and lies with her and she
[1:29:43] conceives
[1:29:44] and then he tries to hide it and he lies
[1:29:48] and
[1:29:48] he does all kinds of horrible things and
[1:29:50] commits murder then he takes her to mary
[1:29:52] but the product of that union dies the
[1:29:55] seventh son on the seventh day
[1:29:57] dies but he's already married to her
[1:30:01] and now he goes in unto her to comfort
[1:30:03] her at the death of this child
[1:30:05] and now the baby's born and
[1:30:08] david names this baby
[1:30:13] solomon
[1:30:17] right then you knew who was going to be
[1:30:20] the king
[1:30:22] right then you knew who was going to
[1:30:24] bring peace to israel
[1:30:25] right then he's already born
[1:30:28] but how did he come he come by bathsheba
[1:30:32] how could david name this baby solomon
[1:30:35] how could he possibly after the adultery
[1:30:38] after the lies
[1:30:39] after the murders after all the wrong
[1:30:41] this baby now comes
[1:30:42] this baby should have been anything but
[1:30:44] the fulfillment of that prophecy
[1:30:46] it shouldn't have been through her it
[1:30:47] shouldn't have been this way it
[1:30:49] shouldn't have come this way
[1:30:50] and you shouldn't be here and it
[1:30:52] shouldn't be you and it shouldn't have
[1:30:53] come this way
[1:30:54] and it shouldn't have been through this
[1:30:56] disaster in this trial and if i was a
[1:30:57] seed of god why didn't he keep me from
[1:30:59] this and why didn't he keep me from that
[1:31:00] if i was predestinated to bring forth
[1:31:02] christ why did he let me fall into that
[1:31:04] temptation and fall into that temptation
[1:31:06] and fall into this ruin
[1:31:10] because when the baby was born he called
[1:31:12] him
[1:31:13] solomon david saying you're the
[1:31:16] fulfillment of the promise that god gave
[1:31:18] to me
[1:31:18] you will build the temple you will build
[1:31:21] nobody else could believe it
[1:31:22] nobody else could believe that through
[1:31:24] this this is going to be the way solomon
[1:31:26] comes
[1:31:27] but this is the fulfillment of the
[1:31:29] prophecy
[1:31:30] that's why nobody can accept it today
[1:31:33] because we're a modern bathsheba
[1:31:35] and nobody says it can't be her it is
[1:31:36] her
[1:31:38] it can't be this way it is this way it
[1:31:41] can't be this time
[1:31:42] it is this time it's this time this way
[1:31:45] these people and you're it
[1:31:48] and he's already got thus saith the lord
[1:31:51] he's already named it
[1:31:52] he's already said i'm going to call you
[1:31:54] bride
[1:31:57] so that you'll understand
[1:32:00] and why in an invisible union was a
[1:32:03] bride united to christ
[1:32:05] because david was given a wife to
[1:32:07] reproduce himself
[1:32:10] and christ has been given a bride to do
[1:32:13] the same what's coming forth from this
[1:32:17] bathsheba
[1:32:19] solomon
[1:32:23] this whole ordeal with adam knight is
[1:32:24] just taking place
[1:32:26] and david has already named the child
[1:32:29] solomon
[1:32:32] and bathsheba says you promised me
[1:32:36] of the lord that solomon was going to be
[1:32:39] king in your stead
[1:32:40] well of course he did he named him
[1:32:41] solomon
[1:32:44] he knew he was the fulfillment of the
[1:32:45] prophecy knew it knew it before he grew
[1:32:48] up
[1:32:48] knew it before anything day one he's
[1:32:50] birthed takes the breath of life
[1:32:52] says you're it solomon
[1:32:56] now there's the waiting period for
[1:32:59] solomon to grow up
[1:33:00] and to come to his position so he can
[1:33:02] take his throne
[1:33:04] but the prophecy has been with him from
[1:33:06] day one
[1:33:08] his name is solomon day one
[1:33:14] where is christ conceived in this
[1:33:15] invisible union
[1:33:17] day one how can it be you
[1:33:21] you used to believe in trinitarian
[1:33:22] doctrine bathsheba used to be married to
[1:33:25] the hittite
[1:33:28] how can it be you amen you've done all
[1:33:31] kinds of sins
[1:33:31] hey how could it be rahab to bring forth
[1:33:33] boaz amen she was the harlot
[1:33:35] how could it be go back and read the
[1:33:37] bible it can be me
[1:33:39] and it can be now and it can be because
[1:33:41] it was recorded on the lam's book of
[1:33:42] life before the foundation of the world
[1:33:44] when the lamb was
[1:33:45] already slayed for every sin that i
[1:33:47] would commit thousands of years before i
[1:33:49] would commit it
[1:33:50] because god's plan is coming through and
[1:33:52] it will will not be stopped
[1:33:54] solomon was coming and solomon was
[1:33:56] coming through bathsheba
[1:33:59] no doubt in all of and all of the wives
[1:34:02] of david he could have found one that
[1:34:03] hadn't
[1:34:04] sinned or at least hadn't commit
[1:34:06] adultery
[1:34:08] i'm sure david could have had a wife
[1:34:10] that had an impeccable record
[1:34:13] that had a perfect score she could have
[1:34:16] been beautiful
[1:34:17] she could have been perfect she could
[1:34:18] have had a voice like a dove i mean she
[1:34:20] could have
[1:34:21] she could have been raised in the finest
[1:34:22] home he had wives
[1:34:25] he had concubines he had other sources
[1:34:27] that solomon could have come from
[1:34:29] but solomon wasn't going to come from
[1:34:31] any of those sources
[1:34:32] solomon was going to come from bathsheba
[1:34:35] he said why did god let it happen this
[1:34:37] way
[1:34:37] why was there adultery and why was there
[1:34:38] murder i can't explain to you why
[1:34:41] any of it but why are you sitting here
[1:34:43] today why do you believe why have you
[1:34:45] been impregnated by the word amen
[1:34:47] when when you've lived the line of life
[1:34:49] you've lived i've lived the kind of life
[1:34:51] i live
[1:34:51] i can't explain it to you i don't
[1:34:53] understand it all i know is it's written
[1:34:56] there
[1:34:56] and i believe it and bathsheba was the
[1:34:58] one she was predestinated
[1:35:00] to be there and the moment that baby was
[1:35:01] born david knew it and david said you're
[1:35:04] solomon
[1:35:10] and now when everything goes quiet
[1:35:14] he names him solomon tells bathsheba
[1:35:17] he's going to
[1:35:18] come on the throne i tell you in the
[1:35:19] name of the lord everything goes quiet
[1:35:23] and the kingdom of david david gets
[1:35:25] weaker
[1:35:26] and weaker and weaker and weaker
[1:35:30] and weaker until he's almost gone
[1:35:33] and as he gets weaker adenizer starts
[1:35:35] strengthening himself
[1:35:37] and the antichrist gets stronger and
[1:35:40] stronger
[1:35:41] and stronger until he exalts himself
[1:35:47] thinking he's going to take the throne
[1:35:50] but bathsheba's got a promise
[1:35:54] and she's got a prophet to remind her of
[1:35:56] her promise
[1:35:58] she goes to the king and says king
[1:35:59] you're not going to let this stand
[1:36:02] because you made me a promise
[1:36:07] brother madam says in jehovah jireh
[1:36:11] now there has been two covenants one of
[1:36:14] them has
[1:36:15] one of them was the adam covenant god
[1:36:18] made a covenant with the man if you will
[1:36:19] i will
[1:36:20] and he broke it then god made a covenant
[1:36:22] with noah that was the noah covenant and
[1:36:24] it was broke
[1:36:26] now he's making the abrahamic covenant
[1:36:28] in the abrahamic covenant according to
[1:36:29] genesis the 12th chapter
[1:36:31] it was given unconditionally
[1:36:34] what covenant do you want to be in
[1:36:37] abrahamic covenant therefore it's
[1:36:41] eternal because it's unconditional
[1:36:43] not if you will i will he said i have
[1:36:46] i've
[1:36:46] already done it
[1:36:50] not i will not i will do it i
[1:36:53] have done it that's all that that's the
[1:36:56] basis of faith
[1:36:57] god is determined to save man who's
[1:37:00] determined to save who
[1:37:02] god's determined to save man are you
[1:37:05] determined to be saved
[1:37:06] no god's determined to save you if you
[1:37:09] feel
[1:37:10] any inclination to him at all it's the
[1:37:12] father drawing
[1:37:16] praise god
[1:37:21] man can't keep his covenant so god saves
[1:37:23] man by his grace
[1:37:24] under a covenant that's unconditional
[1:37:27] unconditional
[1:37:28] covenant oh my never ending that was all
[1:37:31] of it three perfect noah
[1:37:33] abraham i mean adam noah and abraham now
[1:37:36] that's the reason we are abraham's
[1:37:37] children that covenant cannot
[1:37:39] end never end because it's
[1:37:41] unconditionally
[1:37:42] it isn't because you do something it's
[1:37:44] because god did something
[1:37:46] not because you chose god god chose you
[1:37:49] do you believe that
[1:37:50] that's the only way i can believe it
[1:37:53] because if i have to believe it based
[1:37:54] off something i've done
[1:37:56] then something and then something else
[1:37:57] that i do can take me out of it but this
[1:37:59] is a covenant that's not based on
[1:38:01] anything i
[1:38:02] do it's based on what he has already
[1:38:05] done
[1:38:06] and now he's coming the end time to open
[1:38:08] up those seven mysterious thunders to
[1:38:10] show us what he's done
[1:38:13] and who he's done it for and how he's
[1:38:15] done it and you realize
[1:38:17] amen if it wasn't for god and if it
[1:38:19] wasn't for predestination
[1:38:20] there wouldn't be anybody saved
[1:38:25] it's not our determination to be right
[1:38:26] with god it's god's determination to
[1:38:28] have a seed
[1:38:30] it's not our determination to believe
[1:38:31] the message it's not our determination
[1:38:33] to live holy
[1:38:33] it's god's determination to express his
[1:38:36] word
[1:38:38] it's not what we did that's why the
[1:38:39] conditional covenant adam failed the
[1:38:41] conditional covenant and noah failed
[1:38:43] every conditional covenant failed he had
[1:38:45] a conditional covenant for the people to
[1:38:47] keep the land
[1:38:47] amen but they failed on their end they
[1:38:49] left the land
[1:38:51] every time there was a can there was a
[1:38:52] covenant based on condition
[1:38:54] man fell so god would make a covenant
[1:38:58] that's based on no conditions
[1:39:01] so that his plan will never be thwarted
[1:39:05] you can't stop it
[1:39:08] you can try the devil can try
[1:39:12] pull you into a trap get you into a
[1:39:15] horrible situation
[1:39:17] you commit sins that you'll regret the
[1:39:18] rest of your life
[1:39:20] you know we read these stories in the
[1:39:22] bible
[1:39:24] right and then we read them and we skip
[1:39:26] through them
[1:39:27] but can you imagine the guilt that david
[1:39:29] carried
[1:39:30] the regrets that he had for the rest of
[1:39:33] his life
[1:39:35] uriah wasn't a bad guy he wasn't an
[1:39:37] enemy king it wasn't an enemy kingdom
[1:39:40] this was somebody who was fighting for
[1:39:42] him a warrior in his army
[1:39:45] a notable man
[1:39:48] a man who who he wasn't even
[1:39:52] israelite he was a hittite but he had so
[1:39:55] adopted their ways
[1:39:56] that he that he says the ark of the
[1:39:58] covenant and my lord job is in battle
[1:40:01] i mean he has so embraced this being an
[1:40:04] outsider grafted in
[1:40:05] that he's giving his whole life to it
[1:40:09] can you imagine how david felt when he
[1:40:11] were to reflect on years
[1:40:13] of what he's done how he's done it can
[1:40:16] you imagine how bathsheba felt
[1:40:18] when she would think about how kind
[1:40:20] yarai had always been to her and he
[1:40:21] never done anything wrong to her
[1:40:23] and how could she do that
[1:40:26] and through all the guilt and through
[1:40:28] all the regrets
[1:40:30] and through it all solomon's coming on
[1:40:33] the throne
[1:40:36] do you think god can work through all
[1:40:38] your tragedies
[1:40:41] all your sins and all your failures all
[1:40:44] your backslidings and
[1:40:45] all those things that you regret so much
[1:40:47] in life
[1:40:49] do you think it can stop what was
[1:40:51] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:40:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:40:57] god's going to bring solomon he already
[1:41:00] prophesied
[1:41:00] is going to be a solomon his name's
[1:41:01] going to be solomon and when he's born
[1:41:03] it says
[1:41:04] david called him solomon and the lord
[1:41:08] loved him now what did solomon do to get
[1:41:12] the lord to love him
[1:41:15] he was just born all he was he's born he
[1:41:18] born he breathed
[1:41:20] ah i love him he didn't do anything to
[1:41:22] earn that love
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:25] he didn't accomplish one task he hadn't
[1:41:27] already built the temple he had not
[1:41:29] already taken the throne
[1:41:30] the fact that he was born and david says
[1:41:32] you're solomon the lord says i love him
[1:41:35] that's the one and i'm going to send the
[1:41:37] prophet to go and reinforce my love for
[1:41:39] him
[1:41:39] so that if he missed it the first time
[1:41:41] the prophet is going to come and back it
[1:41:42] up and call him jedediah
[1:41:44] whom beloved of jehovah
[1:41:51] we should have no doubts friends about
[1:41:54] his love for us about the predestinated
[1:41:56] plan of god
[1:41:57] amen you can say but i make so many
[1:41:58] mistakes so what
[1:42:01] repent and say god take over my life i
[1:42:03] don't want to make these mistakes i need
[1:42:05] your spirit
[1:42:06] to run this life because my human spirit
[1:42:08] won't work my mind won't work my
[1:42:10] willpower won't work i need to be
[1:42:11] possessed of the spirit of god to live
[1:42:14] the right kind of life
[1:42:15] amen not i'll get right you'll never get
[1:42:17] right in a million years you won't get
[1:42:19] right
[1:42:19] amen let him make you right by his own
[1:42:22] life inside of you
[1:42:23] [Applause]
[1:42:27] improving his word 1964 the prophet of
[1:42:30] god says
[1:42:31] now i want you to notice he does it the
[1:42:32] way that way in every age
[1:42:35] he does it every time by the same method
[1:42:37] he has to take believers
[1:42:39] and in order to have believers to meet
[1:42:40] the word he has got to predestinate it
[1:42:42] to that age
[1:42:45] i'm going to read that again because
[1:42:46] that will blow your mind if you catch it
[1:42:49] right listen what he says in order
[1:42:53] to have believers to meet the word
[1:42:57] because if he's going to bring his word
[1:42:58] he's got to have somebody there to
[1:43:00] believe it
[1:43:01] right so it does god no good
[1:43:05] to speak his word to have nobody there
[1:43:06] to believe it why would he bring a new
[1:43:07] word in an age if nobody would believe
[1:43:09] it
[1:43:09] why would he bring noah's message if
[1:43:11] somebody wasn't going to build the ark
[1:43:13] why would he read moses message if
[1:43:15] somebody wasn't going to leave egypt
[1:43:17] there was going to be believers and he
[1:43:19] knew there was going to be believers
[1:43:20] amen so he sent his word
[1:43:21] so in order to have believers in every
[1:43:23] word he predestinated them to be there
[1:43:28] if he didn't predestinate for there be
[1:43:29] the believers there there would be
[1:43:31] nobody to believe the word of god
[1:43:34] you don't believe the word of god with
[1:43:36] your mind
[1:43:38] you don't believe the word of god with
[1:43:39] your outer man i mean there's only one
[1:43:41] thing that's truly believing this word
[1:43:43] and that is the seed of god down in the
[1:43:45] soul is the only thing believing the
[1:43:47] word
[1:43:48] and if god hadn't put it there before
[1:43:49] the foundation of the world there's no
[1:43:51] way that you could accept this message
[1:43:54] you may get somebody who painted in such
[1:43:56] a picture that it looks appetizing and
[1:43:58] appealing to you
[1:43:59] and you'll agree with it and go along
[1:44:00] with it and see enough scriptures but
[1:44:02] somewhere along the line
[1:44:03] you're going to hit something that won't
[1:44:05] register intellectually
[1:44:06] it'll short socket it'll blow a fuse and
[1:44:09] you'll walk away
[1:44:11] because the believer is on the inside
[1:44:19] in order to have believers to meet the
[1:44:21] word he's got to predestinate it to that
[1:44:24] age
[1:44:27] do you believe do you believe bathsheba
[1:44:30] was ordained to bring forth solomon
[1:44:35] you bring david was ordained to bring
[1:44:38] forth solomon
[1:44:41] you realize friends if he hadn't
[1:44:42] ordained them
[1:44:44] if he had not predestinated them and
[1:44:47] wrote their names on the land's book of
[1:44:48] life
[1:44:49] with a lamb that was slain before the
[1:44:51] foundation of the world
[1:44:53] there's no way they could have brought
[1:44:54] forth solomon
[1:44:58] that's why the lamb was slain before the
[1:45:00] foundation of the world that's why the
[1:45:02] names are wrote there
[1:45:03] because everybody would fall into such
[1:45:05] ruin god would have to cast us away
[1:45:09] he would have to he'd be forced to cast
[1:45:10] us away unless he already wrote a name
[1:45:12] in the book
[1:45:13] already sealed it and already we had a
[1:45:15] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:45:17] world
[1:45:19] or his plan could have never come forth
[1:45:22] and you think you're going to be lost
[1:45:26] you think you're going to fall away
[1:45:27] you're afraid that i'll fall away and
[1:45:28] not be reading
[1:45:29] there's nothing to be afraid of you
[1:45:31] didn't come on your own
[1:45:33] and if you came on your own you might as
[1:45:35] well leave because at some point you're
[1:45:36] going to leave anyways because the only
[1:45:37] ones that can come are the ones the
[1:45:38] father has drawn
[1:45:40] what's doing the drawing what's he
[1:45:42] drawing the word is drawing what the
[1:45:43] word is drawing the word
[1:45:45] where is the word in the soul in the
[1:45:47] seed there's the word the word is
[1:45:49] drawing the word
[1:45:50] amen so the word goes forth to do the
[1:45:52] drawing but it can only draw
[1:45:54] where the word is the word connects to
[1:45:56] the word the life connects
[1:45:58] to the life the spirit connects to the
[1:46:00] spirit
[1:46:02] there's no word there no life there no
[1:46:04] spirit there there's nothing to draw
[1:46:10] hallelujah i just love it i'm gonna read
[1:46:13] this sentence again
[1:46:14] i would just read it ten times and keep
[1:46:16] preaching in order to have believers to
[1:46:19] meet the word
[1:46:20] he's got to predestinate it to that age
[1:46:24] to that age in order to have believers
[1:46:29] to meet the word because he's going to
[1:46:30] send the word so there's going to be a
[1:46:31] believer to meet the word
[1:46:33] so what happened to you i met the word
[1:46:37] i'm a believer who met the word how he
[1:46:40] predestinated it to be in that age
[1:46:43] that means solomon was born at the
[1:46:46] precise time
[1:46:49] to the precise parent in the precise way
[1:46:51] he came
[1:46:54] how can it be it is quit asking how it
[1:46:58] can be it is
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:01] how can it be that this little kentucky
[1:47:03] hillbilly with a seventh grade education
[1:47:05] can be the great prophet that's been
[1:47:07] prophesied of all
[1:47:08] time and come at the end of the age the
[1:47:10] great gentile
[1:47:11] how can it be with no education with no
[1:47:13] system backing with no formal
[1:47:16] how can it be it is quit asking how it
[1:47:18] can be it is
[1:47:20] how can it be this group of misfit
[1:47:21] people that's gathered amen
[1:47:23] around this word amen and they've come
[1:47:25] from this and they've come from that and
[1:47:26] they've been through this and they've
[1:47:27] been through that
[1:47:28] amen we all have rap sheets and if we
[1:47:30] all got them out we'd all be equally
[1:47:34] embarrassed
[1:47:36] how can it be it is how can it be me
[1:47:40] stop asking that question that's a
[1:47:43] foolish question
[1:47:47] that shiva could ask how why why me why
[1:47:50] is that i bore solomon
[1:47:52] who cares why you bore
[1:47:55] solomon how can i be the bride
[1:47:59] i don't care how i don't care why i
[1:48:01] don't care what mechanism god used amen
[1:48:04] all i care is that i
[1:48:04] am that's the greatest revelation to me
[1:48:07] that i
[1:48:08] am why am i because he's going to have a
[1:48:10] word in this age and then in order to
[1:48:12] have a believer to meet this word
[1:48:13] he had to predestinate now i want to
[1:48:15] change this a little bit
[1:48:16] amen in order to have a believer to meet
[1:48:19] the word he had to predestinate it to
[1:48:21] eat
[1:48:21] each age that's fine to say that's fun
[1:48:26] but in order to have believers to meet
[1:48:30] his word
[1:48:31] he had to predestinate me to be here
[1:48:34] today
[1:48:38] that brings a total different level to
[1:48:40] the revelation
[1:48:42] it's not that he had to predestinate
[1:48:43] believers that's fine if you don't know
[1:48:45] that you're one of those believers that
[1:48:46] quote don't mean a thing to you
[1:48:49] yes he in order to have believers to
[1:48:51] meet the word he had to predestinate
[1:48:53] change that makes sense that's work
[1:48:54] god's right in order to do it he's got
[1:48:56] to predestinate i see that
[1:48:58] but if you can't put yourself in that
[1:49:00] quote and say he's speaking about me
[1:49:02] personally then this message hasn't come
[1:49:05] alive to you yet
[1:49:07] then it's not for you yet amen something
[1:49:09] has to quicken to where you can say
[1:49:11] when he speaks that quote he's talking
[1:49:12] about me that's me
[1:49:14] right there god had to predestinate me
[1:49:16] to be here in this age
[1:49:18] and why would he why would he choose me
[1:49:20] he didn't choose me based off my conduct
[1:49:23] whenever we asked that question why
[1:49:24] would he choose me we started saying but
[1:49:27] i committed adultery
[1:49:28] but i was a thief amen but i was a drug
[1:49:30] addict but i did this and i did that
[1:49:32] amen he chose you before the foundation
[1:49:34] of the world
[1:49:35] amen and he didn't choose you he wasn't
[1:49:38] choosing your flesh body with all that
[1:49:40] he was choosing himself that
[1:49:42] portion of the seed that would fall into
[1:49:44] your flesh body in this day
[1:49:46] and he even ordained that flesh body we
[1:49:48] understand that he saw after your
[1:49:50] grandparents to get you the way you are
[1:49:51] we know that but we misconstrue the
[1:49:54] whole deal with predestination
[1:49:57] you say well my flesh to this my flesh
[1:49:58] is your flesh doesn't want come
[1:50:01] predestinated to see this
[1:50:06] it come into your body and that's the
[1:50:09] real you
[1:50:13] and when you place yourself in this
[1:50:14] scripture you're not placing the man in
[1:50:17] the mirror
[1:50:19] you're placing the genuine you the
[1:50:22] portion of the word that's expressed
[1:50:24] and meet the word in this day you say
[1:50:27] that's me bathsheba was predestinated
[1:50:32] adultery couldn't erase it
[1:50:35] david was predestinated before solomon
[1:50:37] murder couldn't erase it
[1:50:40] oh my goodness
[1:50:44] god is bringing a faith higher in the
[1:50:45] bride where she has confidence
[1:50:47] and then she gets to the point where she
[1:50:48] says that's me i'm not apologizing it's
[1:50:50] me
[1:50:52] it's me i'm not qualifying it it's me
[1:50:54] it's me i'm not trying to explain to you
[1:50:56] why it's me but i know i'm part of the
[1:50:57] bride of jesus christ
[1:50:58] amen christ is being manifest in this
[1:51:00] earth through this body right here amen
[1:51:02] and and if you want to meet him come
[1:51:04] here and i'll express him to you i'll
[1:51:05] explain him to you i'll share with you
[1:51:07] what's inside of me
[1:51:09] and i'm not apologizing for it because i
[1:51:11] believe it amen
[1:51:13] and i'm not hiding it under a bushel
[1:51:14] basket because i believe it's the truth
[1:51:18] i'm not going to say everybody's okay
[1:51:19] they all have their own way and there's
[1:51:21] all these other paths
[1:51:24] i don't believe it that way i believe
[1:51:27] he's expressing himself in his bride
[1:51:31] i believe she's bringing forth christ
[1:51:34] she's conceived
[1:51:36] amen she's taken an invisible union
[1:51:39] she's taken a conception and now she's
[1:51:41] bringing forth christ
[1:51:46] in order to have believers to meet the
[1:51:48] word he had to predestinate to be there
[1:51:49] in that age
[1:51:51] why are you here because of that quote
[1:51:53] right there
[1:51:56] but what about the past forget about the
[1:51:57] past what about this quote
[1:52:02] amen he's got to predestinate these
[1:52:05] things to be here
[1:52:07] listen you see he's got to predestinate
[1:52:10] this thing to be there to meet the
[1:52:12] challenge of the age
[1:52:14] did it get you did you feel it did you
[1:52:17] see it
[1:52:18] amen i love that
[1:52:23] did you see it do you understand it
[1:52:25] that's what's happening today
[1:52:26] he predestinated to this by his
[1:52:29] foreknowledge
[1:52:30] when he predestinated in malachi 4 it's
[1:52:33] got to happen
[1:52:34] when he came over and predestinates
[1:52:36] anything to happen in his word
[1:52:37] he had to prove his word to be so when
[1:52:40] he predestinates anything to happen and
[1:52:42] says it will happen
[1:52:43] he knows that seed will be there just at
[1:52:46] that time
[1:52:50] that's me who wants to raise your hands
[1:52:53] and say that's
[1:52:54] me right here he preached that they need
[1:52:56] to be there he predestined to be a bride
[1:52:59] and a capstone ministry amen to bring
[1:53:01] forth the evidence that christ is on
[1:53:03] earth again
[1:53:04] it's here i'm it i'm part of that seed
[1:53:07] manifesting amen the word for this day
[1:53:12] hallelujah if he pre-doesn't anything to
[1:53:16] happen he says it will happen
[1:53:18] he knows that seed will be there just at
[1:53:20] that time he predestinated a bride
[1:53:23] she's going to be there going to be a
[1:53:25] rapture she's going to be there
[1:53:26] he predestinates by his foreign seat
[1:53:29] there's nothing
[1:53:30] going to stop it
[1:53:34] hallelujah don't you worry about any
[1:53:38] atonizer move
[1:53:40] don't you worry oh my goodness sometimes
[1:53:42] i get so
[1:53:43] discouraged at people who send me links
[1:53:46] to conspiracy theories
[1:53:48] thinking they're going to understand the
[1:53:50] government's moving this way and they've
[1:53:51] got these fema camps and this is going
[1:53:53] to happen
[1:53:55] i'm not worried about what elijah's
[1:53:56] doing i've got a promise
[1:53:57] [Applause]
[1:54:00] i i'm not worried about what elijah's
[1:54:02] going to do
[1:54:03] and how he's going to exalt himself and
[1:54:05] how he's going to have 50 horses and 50
[1:54:07] men
[1:54:07] and that represents this and that i
[1:54:09] don't care i don't plan to be here
[1:54:11] amen when the pope is incarnate i don't
[1:54:14] plan to be here for the tribulation
[1:54:16] i plan to be sailing off into another
[1:54:18] dimension amen
[1:54:19] feasting in the wedding supper of the
[1:54:21] lamb
[1:54:23] i don't need to know the conspiracy and
[1:54:25] how they're working it all out
[1:54:27] and how it's going to happen and how
[1:54:28] they're going to change the laws and
[1:54:29] it's going to fall
[1:54:30] i don't care
[1:54:35] i've already got a promise i've already
[1:54:38] conceived
[1:54:41] what i've conceived has already been
[1:54:42] named
[1:54:44] that baby's christ
[1:54:47] that's the one that's going to take the
[1:54:48] throne
[1:54:53] that's the one that's going to take the
[1:54:54] throne
[1:54:58] can i show you something in the
[1:54:59] scriptures before we go
[1:55:02] let's go to first kings i wasn't going
[1:55:04] to do this but let's do it
[1:55:07] there's some things in here that i don't
[1:55:08] fully understand i'm not going to try to
[1:55:10] explain them all because i don't
[1:55:11] understand them
[1:55:12] but there's something else in here that
[1:55:13] i find to be very
[1:55:15] very strange
[1:55:30] okay i'm not going to explain all this
[1:55:33] because i don't know it so don't ask me
[1:55:35] i'll get a million
[1:55:36] questions and texts saying what did that
[1:55:37] mean i don't know i'm just telling you
[1:55:39] all i know
[1:55:42] but after solomon takes the throne his
[1:55:44] father gives it to him david dies
[1:55:46] adonaija tries to get to by shag
[1:55:50] the virgin that used to lay with david
[1:55:52] to keep him warm
[1:55:55] and he in adonijah comes to bathsheba
[1:55:58] and says
[1:55:59] will you ask solomon that i can have a
[1:56:01] buy shag to be my wife
[1:56:02] i'm not going to try to explain all that
[1:56:04] because i don't understand it all
[1:56:06] but there's something that happens when
[1:56:08] bathsheba
[1:56:09] comes to solomon and let's read this
[1:56:14] verse 18 it's first kings chapter 2.
[1:56:17] sorry first kings chapter 2
[1:56:20] verse 18.
[1:56:27] first kings chapter 2 verse 18
[1:56:30] and bathsheba said well i will speak for
[1:56:33] thee and to the king.
[1:56:35] verse 19 bathsheba therefore went unto
[1:56:37] king solomon to speak unto him for
[1:56:38] adonijah
[1:56:40] and the king rose up to meet her and
[1:56:41] bowed himself under her and sat down on
[1:56:43] his throne and caused the seat to be set
[1:56:45] for the king's mother
[1:56:46] and she sat on his right hand
[1:56:57] you mean the thing that we bring forth
[1:57:01] christ brought forth from the bride is
[1:57:02] going to sit on the throne
[1:57:05] and then we're going to sit next to him
[1:57:08] that's exactly what's going to happen
[1:57:10] friends
[1:57:13] why is that written like that i don't
[1:57:14] know what i was having to see
[1:57:16] i don't know but as soon as bathsheba
[1:57:18] comes he rises and bows to bathsheba
[1:57:22] and he brings a chair up and causes her
[1:57:24] to be set on his throne
[1:57:26] on his right hand
[1:57:32] praise be to god all i can say
[1:57:36] is that's me too
[1:57:39] that's my position i don't know how it's
[1:57:41] going to work out i don't know what all
[1:57:42] means but that's me too
[1:57:45] praise be to god let's all stand
[1:57:50] oh this word is so rich to me friends
[1:57:53] it gets richer every single day
[1:57:57] brother brennan's coming along and
[1:57:58] preaching the seals and he says now i
[1:58:00] can only hit the high parts just enough
[1:58:01] so you'll know what it is
[1:58:03] he says i could take each one of the
[1:58:05] seals and go around and around a clock
[1:58:07] on that
[1:58:07] he said i could preach a month of
[1:58:09] services and still never touch it
[1:58:12] i'll be honest with you i heard him say
[1:58:14] that and be like really
[1:58:16] i mean like a month of services i say
[1:58:19] praise god
[1:58:20] he was right you just comb through the
[1:58:23] bible and it's there and it's there and
[1:58:25] it's there and it's there and it's there
[1:58:26] and brother brenham told us and christ
[1:58:28] is mystery of god revealed it's been in
[1:58:29] every type and every character has been
[1:58:31] portraying it all down through the bible
[1:58:33] this entire bible is the revelation of
[1:58:35] god's mystery in christ
[1:58:37] and i say amen praise be to god
[1:58:42] let's bow our heads dear heavenly father
[1:58:45] we thank you lord
[1:58:47] we praise your name lord and thank you
[1:58:49] for all that you're doing in this
[1:58:50] hour now sometimes it's more than our
[1:58:54] human
[1:58:54] side can comprehend our mind can be
[1:58:57] confused our
[1:58:59] our spirit can just not understand
[1:59:02] but we're so thankful we're not relying
[1:59:04] on those things lord
[1:59:06] there's something so much deeper that
[1:59:08] goes back
[1:59:09] so much further than our life here on
[1:59:11] this earth
[1:59:13] and that part is saying amen
[1:59:16] that's nothing but the truth and more
[1:59:19] than that
[1:59:19] it's not just saying amen it's nothing
[1:59:21] but the truth but lord that you
[1:59:23] deposited in us
[1:59:24] is saying that's me this is my time
[1:59:28] this is my scripture this is my quote
[1:59:31] and i'm going to live it in jesus
[1:59:33] christ's name

[1:59:38] keep us
[1:59:40] keep us close to you lord help us not to
[1:59:42] stray away in our wonderings and our
[1:59:44] failings
[1:59:45] but help us to repent and give you
[1:59:46] preeminence and stay close to you lord
[1:59:49] that you might have your way in us we
[1:59:52] might bring forth that which we're
[1:59:53] called to bring forth in this hour
[1:59:56] god we just pray that you would just
[1:59:58] continue to unlock your word
[2:00:01] let us see you lord not scripture verses
[2:00:05] let's see you lord and lord you in turn
[2:00:08] will turn around and identify
[2:00:10] us in the mirror of the word and we see
[2:00:14] lord that you've called us to this hour
[2:00:16] you've predestinated to be here to meet
[2:00:18] this word in this hour
[2:00:20] and god somehow we know it's the truth
[2:00:24] somehow beyond human intellect we know
[2:00:27] it's true
[2:00:28] somehow beyond dream somehow beyond
[2:00:31] thoughts
[2:00:32] somehow beyond that we know that this is
[2:00:34] true
[2:00:36] and we know it's true for us as
[2:00:38] individuals
[2:00:40] if there's any here lord where that seed
[2:00:42] is not awakened to life lord i pray that
[2:00:44] you'd quicken it now
[2:00:47] i pray lord that the bright shining
[2:00:49] light of your word will
[2:00:50] strike that seed with warmth and it'll
[2:00:52] quicken lord and come to
[2:00:54] life and begin to bear fruit lord
[2:00:57] we love you god we can do nothing but
[2:01:00] preach the word
[2:01:01] we don't have a program lord that can
[2:01:03] bring forth birth
[2:01:05] we don't have any other measure lord all
[2:01:08] we have is your word
[2:01:10] but you've given us your fully revealed
[2:01:12] word
[2:01:13] and we believe in the power of that word
[2:01:14] to bring to pass all that's written
[2:01:16] therein
[2:01:17] we just pray now that you let it be so
[2:01:19] in each of our lives
[2:01:21] we give ourselves unto you and ask that
[2:01:23] you would manifest yourself greater than
[2:01:25] you ever have before
[2:01:26] that you would fully realize your word
[2:01:29] in this dimension
[2:01:30] in these bodies of flesh we love you

[2:03:02] everything that's ever happened in my
