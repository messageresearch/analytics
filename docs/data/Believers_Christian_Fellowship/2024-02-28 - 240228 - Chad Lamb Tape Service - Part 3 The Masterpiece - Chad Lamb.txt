to be together for part three the finale of the Masterpiece amen we're going to go to prayer but just before we do I wanted to share a a testimony with you really quickly uh Sister Nancy marrow uh had went into the hospital Monday morning and over the weekend she had had um she was having some some problem and she didn't know what it was but she had a bad headache and she was becoming forgetful she was having trouble communicating and even sometimes she was having trouble finding the right word or she would say something totally out of context and use a word that was not fitting and so it wouldn't relent over the weekend so she went Monday morning and um at on initial testing they believe believe she had a stroke they were thinking many strokes and then they ruled that out and they said no it was a mild stroke but she called me this morning and she's going home she was supposed to be home this afternoon and she said the doctor after doing a bunch of uh uh digging he said she had a complex a complex migraine and that was it they gave her some medicine take care of migraine it went away and everything was fine no stroke no no long-term issue and she went home and she was happy and feeling good so we certainly thank God for that that was a good phone call I enjoyed hearing from her and she was bright and cheery on the phone and feeling so much better man you heard the prayer request for the Dean Hart family at the passing of sister Joanne and man she was 93 years old and we just want to continue to remember the family remember brother Bob I'm sure he'll be very lonesome and the family there but they're happy they're happy for her they're so thankful she got the cross on to her reward so we're thankful for that there was one more request I wanted to mention there was a prayer request entered in Wednesday for sister lorine Mau and sister Loren many of you don't know but she's been struggling with some health complications lately she had covid last year and pneumonia and when she came out of that she just she's had one issue after another since then and um they've uh she's had problems with her blood sugar they've uh been watching her kidney numbers her kidney numbers keep going lower and they they're talking to her about possible dialysis then there was something they found in the pancreas that they became suspicious of and they went to send her for testing and they begin to begin to be frightful like it was possible cancer and and so this past week all of those issues plus the care her mother needs and all these built up and uh emotionally she just collapsed under the pressure of that it become too much and U but she called me today and she says she is feeling so much better the prayers were answered she feels good she's got a positive outlook she's testifying of her healing and she knows the Lord will bring her out and heal her of all these things so I'd like for us to just agree together as a body that each one of these health issues will go away and that while she's dealing with them all and they're going away that God will strengthen her and and be her stability and her support that she'll know she's in his hand and she can never be taken out of his hand amen so let's bow our heads and pray together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for your goodness for your grace your mercy Lord it abounds in our lives all around us Lord we see examples of your mercy we see examples of your healing touch of your delivering power for God your power has never diminished one iota and your word forever Remains the Same God we just thank you Lord for touching our sister Nancy we're so thankful that she's home and feeling so much better and that Lord that you took care of the situation for her I I pray that you continue to give her strength and restore her Lord her strength and help her to feel good and to feel well Lord we thank you Lord that you took sister Joanne home Lord God for the family that remains I pray you just strengthen them Lord that you would comfort them and be with our brother Bob especially Lord as he'll be so lonesome for his wife I just pray that you would be a friend that's closer than a brother may he feel your very presence Lord as you care for him and Lord we want to agreed together as a body of Believers for our sister lorine you have so miraculously helped her in the past you have delivered her from from so many issues Lord that she struggled with and she is so happy Lord in you so happy for your delivering power and she's testifying and she believes Lord that you will bring her out of every one of these trials and Lord we want to add our faith to hers and we want to stand shoulder Tosh shoulder with our sister believing Lord that you will heal her of every complication that you would help her blood sugar to become regulated and normal that you would help her kidney function to restore Lord and may her numbers improve and she would not have to go on dialysis and Lord whatever the suspicion is about the pancreas I pray that it would be ruled out and everything would be fine Lord we're just asking for you to come on the scene for our sister Lord

give her more fuel more words to speak more testimonies to share and Lord that the enemy might be defeated and you might be glorified I pray that you bless us tonight Lord as we look into your word and and listen to the last part of this message that you've delivered to us I pray God that it would go deep into our hearts Lord it become a living reality within us I pray that you'd bless us Lord and that that you would bless us in the word and may the word transform our lives and bring us into the very image that you had of us before the found foundation of the world we give you preeminence We Worship You Lord we ask that you would bless us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you while we're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to Isaiah thank you musicians the Lord bless you we want to read our opening scripture again Isaiah 53 we want to keep it on the Forefront of our mind as we listen to this last section because brother B's going to refer to it again and it's going to be interesting the way he refers to the scripture so we want this to remain in our minds Isaiah 53:1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he has no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he ha borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put Heath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because Heath poured out his soul into death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors praise God Amen God bless you as your seated as brother brandom said what a what a what an interesting scripture to read for the subject of Masterpiece amen praise the Lord Let's uh if we could pull up the PowerPoint brother Franco for the questions first I want to do a quick review if you could go with me in the book The Masterpiece and let's go to paragraph 37 on page 8 and I just want to do a quick review to remind us of what uh what we've been looking at as we go into this last part so on page 8 down towards the bottom in paragraph 37 we'll read just a few Snippets out of here and then when it was completed this is where he's talking about Michelangelo working on the statue of Moses then when it was completed he stood back with the hammer the sculptor's hammer in his hand and he looked at that monument and the inspiration of the vision that he had seen of how to do it inspired him so much till the inspiration struck him till he got beside himself and he struck it across the knee and he said speak now there's a flaw on the great image on the knee on the right knee just above the knee about 6 Ines as a place I put my hand on it about that deep after he had spent all that time for years and years to make this then under the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart and in his vision and desired to see it was completed and when it was completed he was so inspired by it till he thought his his own Masterpiece should speak back to him and he struck it across the leg and holler speak and it made a flaw on it it put a flaw on the image to me the flaw was what made it the Masterpiece now maybe to the mind that might think different you might you think that spoiled it no to me it made it what it was because after so many years of careful work and toils and inspiration and so forth of making his toil had proved not in vain it was perfect and that's why he cried out speak now let's go to paragraph 44 down here at the bottom now let us turn the page of Michelangelo and close the book and let's open another book and read of the great sculptor the almighty who before there was a world and before the foundations was laid he had in his mind what he wanted and he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something in reality of what was a vision to him what was in his thinking now let's turn the page and go to paragraph 47 in the middle of page 10 paragraph 47 but finally there came forth upon the earth a Perfection and that was a man and then he could see in the man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was God now God had now been able to achieve the thing he wanted a man in his own image and then I might say to this that when he made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because that he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was the Eternal and man now in the image of God also existed on the Earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took the piece that struck off of it and made him a help meate a wife then he wasn't by himself he was he had somebody with him and that's his great work let's go to paragraph 52 on the next page page 11 now remember that my opinion the Masterpiece is the stroke that marred St Angelo's Masterpiece in the monument and it was the stroke that cut the side of his Masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see him as a masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it was and it so pleased him till he took rest then he said I'll rest next paragraph and but while he was resting and trusting in his Masterpiece his enemy came in and found his Great Master piece and he by deceit he crawls under the garden walls and then he marred this beautiful Masterpiece he marred it so that it fell let's go down to the last paragraph paragraph 56 but the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down in ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing it should perish lay there like that all the time because he is God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again unto his own image a man now let's go to page 70 or paragraph 70 on page 14 page 14 right at the top paragraph 70 all the prophets had flaws all the ones was a portion but here at last coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were one in so much until he put his own Spirit into him and then even the image of the Builder became the image and the Builder became one God in his sculpture work his Masterpiece Moses was in the work of St Angelo or Michelangelo rather was a sculpture work that was dead because it had been made of stone but here the master builder when he got his handiwork perfected he stepped into it now let's go to paragraph 75 on the next page remember Angelo could only cry out Smite the image and say speak but how differently it was to God the great sculptor when he made a man in his own image so perfect that it reflected him God spoke through the image of man showing what he would do he spoke through the prophets as they were in their potential image as he was bringing it up to the head but when he come to the head he was all the image of God he was portraying himself then smitten for us now he's the Masterpiece to us the gift of God Jesus Christ eternal life I hope we never never forget that now let's go over to paragraph 108 on page 21 page 21 towards the top of the page paragraph 108 now for nearly 2,000 years God has been making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a piece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and old is husband and wife and it taken the new or the old to foreshadow the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece is in the making has it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece in so doing it he does it by his never changing method the same way he made the Masterpiece his word that's the way he makes his Masterpiece because he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's the perfect word praise God I enjoy the review amen all right let's go to the questions now all right question number one what Parable is brother brandham using to explain the bride Masterpiece coming forth so what Parable is brother Brenham using to explain the bride coming forth number two he said what is God doing with his Masterpiece that Michelangelo could not do so number two is what is God doing with his Masterpiece that Michelangelo could not do you're a good student number three how is the bride being restored to the side of the bridegroom how is the bride being restored to the side of the bridegroom and then number four what makes the husband and wife truly a family what makes the husband and wife truly a family and there's a fifth number five what did Beethoven do in the process of making a masterpiece so our last one is what did Beethoven do in the process of making a masterpiece these are fun ones I love finding the answers as we go through okay we are going to start on page 25 at the bottom of par uh page 25 we're going to begin at the beginning of paragraph 136 so that's where we finished we finished at the page the bottom of page 25 last time so we are going to begin at the beginning of paragraph 136 on the bottom of page 25 and we're going to go all the way to the end we've got time we're going to go all the way through to the end and I think it's marvelous at the end we see Brother brandom start to sing and he'll go to prayer and he'll finish with a song and I I love I think it's a privilege we get to hear a prophet of God pray to God I think that's a a a privilege that we get it's very it's Unique it's a blessing and we get the insight into his heart and his desire so we get to hear him pray and we get to hear him sing and we can all sing together with the prophet and worship God together at the End Amen I so love going through this together I love hearing your resp response to the word and don't forget when the word Pricks you respond to the word amen just because it's a tape doesn't mean we sit quiet we get into it amen the only way you can get anything out of anything is if you get into the spirit of it that's what brother B taught us we went through that in the church age book they get into the spirit of a ball game they get into the spirit of whatever they're doing and that's why they enjoy it if we don't get into the spirit of the word we're not going to enjoy it so we need to get into the atmosphere and into the spirit of it amen and respond to the word and and uh hear the prophet pray and sing along and worship God together and we can go ahead and go uh to the tape we're going to begin there paragraph 136 noce share the life that was in the husk in the stalk and in the tossel in the husk all gathers in the sea and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again the Manifest itself but what denominated dies like life and Luther went to make Wesley and and the from a Wesley it went to Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the original seed on to Pentecost comes out of the Wesley until that time the reason that Pentecost come out of Wesley because it was no denomination Pentecost was then Pentecost went to denominate and what did it do it turned to the husk it looked like the real thing and anybody how many ever seen a SE seed of wheat start to grow what's the first little thing it's just exact like the seed but it's a husk see the three stages stalk tsel or the pollen than the husk and then out of the husk Comes The Original Seed not a seed it was the life of the seed growing through this to come to the seed do you see it what is it a Resurrection coming back to a masterpiece again like the one that went in Pentecost came out of the Wesley because Wesley was an organization Pentecost come out as no organization then turned to one it had to to make the husk the True Word of Life on it was on its way then to the original grain through these stages through the stalk then into the pollen from the pollen into the husk and from the husk it made seed no stalk tosel hus living they produced in their early Revival a holder of a certain potion of the seed life but when they organized the life moved out of it that's Pro all history never an organization ever done a thing after organized it was dead that's right watch the life's traveling on now it's moving on notice what they have done all these have done is proved by history just exactly the way the church has come never to be useful to him again organization is laid on the Shelf there never has been in all the history a a church after it organized but what it died and the organis ation died and never did raise again can't you see men who are blind open your eyes nature and the word coordinating together and proving it right here that this is the truth that it is the truth that life leaves a stalk to make the tossle from the tossle it makes the husk and from the husk it goes into to the original yeah again notice never again to be useful to him how noticeable this life is in its travel in the corn of wheat than it is in the tree God called his people like a tree see the life goes down in a tree and comes back up again goes down and comes back up see it goes down and comes back up but in the corn of wheat it goes up from the original stalk to the stalk hostle and husk and the thing that it pass through die so it can't get back to it again what is it it's no use anymore it goes on to his Perfection amen don't you see why he never used an organization he can't get back in it again it's dead but the life passes on from one to the other Hallelujah see they put Creeds in inject whosoever shall add one word or take one word out see he's blocked off from it it must be the life seed traveling on I'm using this in a parable and now of the Bride the Masterpiece is coming forth as a masterpiece fell there's a masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece fell at pentac I see a room a ni after n i see a room she's come through a process but coming right back again so that Masterpiece [Music] perfected cuz she's a part of that word that was spoken by him he'll have a church without spotter wrinkle Lord it'll not be connected any way with any kind of an organization or denomination the cursed thing it's passed through those things but it'll never be there notice the seed is coming up life is coming up not going back there will be no more Resurrection after this amen the life is coming up to go to his Perfection a resurrection notice the husk put forth the uh the notice the husk puts the uh uh Original Seed out of itself in Revelations the thir chapter we find this now remember no other church was he put out of in the Bible of the Church ages how many remembers it he passed through the church age to go on to make something else but this is it there's nothing else but the the sculpture has got back to Perfection again the word see don't go back how different it is yes oh and notice then the the husk when he comes forth looks just like the green but when the green life begins to lead the husk to go into make the grain the bride the husk opens up and excommunicates the grain is that right nature that's exactly what she did in Ro in Revelations 3 we find out the lady is see a church h cut him out I see it didn't back in the other ages because there was something else yet to be made it just passed through and went on to another I've told you all along there's no more denominations coming we're at the end and they put him out because why he's the word again he's like the one that fell down there he's the same doctrine that come forth from the beginning and when the seed word begins to grow forth the husk putts it from itself the life leaves all the others to follow it that's the true believers they follow the life wherever the life go like in Israel a perfect type if we had time and just got a few minutes left but in the perfect type in the beginning everywhere that pillar fire went was life God was that life and I don't care if it's midnight or whether it's in a good selected place when that Pillar of Fire moved the trumpet sounded and Israel moved with it amen hallelujah and when the trumpet sounded Martin Luther moved out with it and he organized killed not he himself the man at him and then God took the life out of that brought it on laid it down the grave then out come Wesley he saw that big organization so he sounded a trumpet of sanctification more of the word hey when he did out they moved right out of right out of Luther right into me Methodist and when Pentecost start they sounded a trumpet it's time for the return of the gifts see what they did they sounded a trumpet and out they come then they organized but remember after the husk that's three stages we know of there's nothing else left but the grain oh God and then the green is put out of all of it amen and amen seed words begins to form itself life it's brought forth out of now notice if the bridegroom the beginning the first bridegroom this is a bride coming forth remember the church began at Pentecost and it fell at niia it sprouted not like the real green no it was some of the life in there but it sprouted in order to make an organization and it pulled through that organization and then what did it do then it went from that organization it went into another organization went into another stage of the word justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost see and as it went through this stalking process it kept coming on more remember the little poen is more the tossel is more like the seed than the stalk is and the husk is more like the seed than the tossel was but the seed itself is beyond that see it just used that for transportation to itself through notice the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word of the bridegroom and then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also notice the bride must be why why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she's just a smitten piece off of him there's the Masterpiece it was smitten s Michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back but God's going to do it he's going to bring this little bride smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there's the Masterpiece the family back again in Garden of Eden how is this bride going to do this how is this uh wheat go to do this Malachi 4 said in the last days it would be restored back what restored back like the beginning take it back I will restore sayth the Lord all the years of Palmer worm and canker worm and all these other things eaten I will restore again Malachi for said he will restore the hearts of the people and the faith of the people back to the original fathers against we see this right before us Church where are we at now closing in a few minutes I want you to notice real close but something that just happened Malachi 4 is to bring back back to the original she is smitten from the church from the church body smitten with her master for the same purpose she's the word as same as Joseph has smitten from his Brethren because he was the word word and Jesus is smitten from his Brethren because he was the word the church is smitten the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word there's your stages again 1 23 just EXA the word living and in action the Bible bride not some man-made bride the Bible bride smitten and Afflicted of God no Beauty we should desire but yet we did it has seen her smitten inflicted of God that's right she stands alone she's smitten from all the denominations according to Revelations 3 she's smitten out of the lady ofan Church age that she was raised up in see this church was raised up in the lady of seea church age that's a husk but if them others went can't you Pentecostal man see that if that other was husk and died if that other stalk had to die if the tossel had to die so must the husk die the three stages of organizations and remember you said well now there's a lot of tosel hanging on there's a lot of this yeah they've been Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Church of Christ all these other little things that fell on to it leaves and everything else and hung on to it but the original was the reformations I see stands alone like the bridegroom rejected of man despised and rejected of the churches the bride stands that way what is it it's his masterpiece PE than it's a word that he can work to make manifest rejected so the stalk the tossel and husk never become seed no but are all the time becoming more like the seed now at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original life back to the Bible Malachi 4 said it would be brought that way oh oh my must have all to be this way it must have all of the word is that right now what did he say in Revelations 10 that would take place why was a trip to Tucson the open to the church in the days of the messenger of the seventh angel the seventh angel messenger the whole word of God would be made manifest the seal that what all the stalk is left off and why and all about it would be made man manifest in this time is that what the word said am then we see it then where are we at hey or are we at there's only one thing the Harvest is here she's dead right she's ready now for the coming notice no it'll never be it the at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original condition and must have all of the word in order to be the seed now you can't have a half a seed it won't grow it's got to be the whole seed it's got to not manifest say I've been baptism the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I've been speaking in tongu that's just part of the seed but now there added to that Hallelujah see the life not the gifts the life all the gifts thing see what I mean we're at the end time Brethren stalk toss husk is dead and dry now there's only one thing that has to happen to that is to be gathered in the world Council of churches Parts burning the word has become flesh exactly like he promised in Luke 17 Malachi 4 and all things that's right Revelations all true life that was in the stalk tossel and husk is now gathering in the seed ready for the resurrection ready for the Harvest the alpha has become Omega the first come the last and the last is the first the seed that went in has come through a process and become the seed again the seed that fell in the Garden of Eden and died died there come back from that imperfect seed that died there come back to the perfect seed the second Adam the first Eve that fell and was used in the second Reformation second coming as bringing forth the child now has become the true bride again the seed right back with the original word again the Alpha and Omega is the same Al he said I am Alpha and Omega you never say anything in between I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last that's there the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same amen the first message and the second last message is the same name I'm I was an alpha I'm an Omega there will be a day that won't be called day T night but in the evening time it shall be light Alpha and Omega it's become the first and the last oh my brother uh we can stay hours on that The Great Masterpiece of a family family the second Adam and the second Eve now ready for the garden the Millennium back on the earth Hallelujah the great sculpture didn't leave him lay there he took time as he did through the millions of years molding the first perfect couple and they fell now it's been through thousands of years he's molded again and now here they are ready amen the Masterpiece was come and struck down from his side come forth the helpmate and she's brought up in the same process now here she is back again with all nature of the Bible and everything else showing here we are nations are breaking Israel's Awakening the signs that the Bible foretold Gentile days number look at this bunch of trash we got with horls encumbered return or disperse to your own trying you better get in there quick if you're going I'm fixing the clothes just in about 5 minutes 10 notice the Great Masterpiece of the family the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they're one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one way and a husband another that would make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family and now that was God's Masterpiece and all true family here portrays that see and now the Masterpiece family has come again Christ and his bride ready to come the second Adam second Eve ready now to return back to their home the whole picture has been Redemption from where it was bringing it back just exactly bringing it back again after the other day standing up here at the Christian businessman many of you I guess was there when I heard that Lutheran priest or preacher is supposed to be stand up there and say that ridiculous thing and make fun of what we believe in and them Full Gospel business man having that man there and seeing that he wore his collar turned around lots of them do now that he said now people ask me why I turn my collar around said how can they tell you from a Catholic priest said there is no difference than there shouldn't be he said we're all God's children he said I know a Catholic priest that's omnipresent that could be present everywhere now you cannot be omnipresent without being ommission God's not even omnipresent God's omn Mission Omission which me makes him omnipresent he knows all things but in order to be a being he has to be one being but being omn Omission he got can't be omnipresent because he knows all thing he know it before the that he know before the world begin how many fleas lice how many bugs and how many times it batter eyes and everything about it see because he's Omni presentent you can't be omn Mission om Mission without being infinite and there only one thing infinite God Amen and then we what is it it's a devil taking them right straight to that Slaughter every one of them going into exactly what the Bible said and here it is see come right in amongst the Pentecostals and just pull them right straight this is what a time oh after that testimony so someone said to me I I it's good thing I didn't say very much because they' probably have me in jail up there but I just thought there it is the people who's taught knows the wise shall know their God in that day said Daniel that's the wise will know they're God they're watching for these things but when I seen that happen and that Pentecostal stand even or robbers looked at me like that I said oh but stand up there with the Ed education polish so that's not the way God polishes his he don't polish his his education he polishes and humility and the power of His manifested word showing the shape of the grain that it went from now someone said to me said brother brandham said there's one thing I can't understand about you I said what's that stand out there in a hall I guess sister D and then went after to shook hands a bill and stand there and all up went around the corner a whole bunch of people a minister priced his way in caller turned around he said why is it that you're always balling the people out he said then people believe you to be a servant of God to be gentle and sweet to them and everything said every time I hear you get up you're balling women out about having short hair and about wearing shorts and wearing makeup and all this other stuff and balling the people out and tell them how cold and formal and indifferent they are so why do you do that so then people love you how can you be a loving Son of God and do a thing like that I thought Lord let me answer this smart man just let me answer him somewhere hang him on his own rope and I said well I said sir did you ever read of the great U uh uh producer of music called the great composer called Beethoven he said oh sure I read a Beethoven I said he probably tore up waste basket fulls of scrap paper but he gave the world masterpieces hallu you never opened his mouth and said another word I said when he was sitting in his study under the inspiration he'd write something down he'd go into his study and pray it wasn't right he scrap it up and throw it in the voice basket but when he got through in all inspiration the world had a masterpiece oh how the word Cuts but it produces masterpieces takes all the husk and stalk away yes it brings forth Masterpiece I got seven minutes to tell you something that happened day before yesterday to get out on time July the 3 I was over here studying in the this Center over here shopping center right out from the sh I've been in pig alley in Rome in France and I've been New York City Los Angeles but the filthiest bunch of women I ever seen in my life is Jeffersonville Indiana I never seen so much gum and filth in my life as I see among some people I sat there to my heart AE and the Lord had gave me a vision now I'm going to tell the vision I don't know what I can interpret it but I I going to tell the vision for my first time I fell into a trance and when I did there was somebody with me I didn't see the person it was just the voice and uh I looked and as I I looked this way he said the bride will come in view for a preview and I looked coming to me and I seen the most the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair and they were longer sleeves and skirts and so forth young women it look kind of I'd say about maybe 20 now I have the Bible open here before me I can only say what I've seen if you say what are you looking at I'm looking at a clock what are you looking for I'm looking for people looking at people why you you looking at I'm looking at the Bible that's what I'm telling the truth that's what I see now I can only say what I seen amen I don't I don't know what it all about it I just have to tell you but when this bride she was looking right at uh the one was talking to me and I standing together her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life looked like it could have been a dozen or more just I don't know how many was a breast but they just a group of and she passed by sweetly with an air and her eyes up watching as passed by oh she was beautiful I looked at her may she passed by he said now we shall review said that's the bride now we will review the churches and they come I notice Sam coming up and when they come up each one look like got worse I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when he said next I heard a noise and said next said Here Comes the American group now I am an American but this this made me sick I am not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed audience to say what was taking place uh uh uh and you'll have to read between the lines but when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch she had a great long nose and a great big mouth and all of them was dressed with some kind of lower clothes down here but the top just had a strap that just a little about a/ inch strap that moved up and went around them like this and each woman had something on an order many of you years ago used to remember when we used to cut that paper you know newspaper and make an old fly bush how many REM you know well I think you use in carnivals you know hanging down like a fringe paper lace paper they had something holding below them like this uh holding below them all this part was exposed and each one had hair cut up real short and fry looking things all over it like that real shortcut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper and the vulgarity now the paper was what was hold in front of them but when they pass the review stand in the back of them and to see the way they were going on in their foremost in their back part and how they were acting I said is that the church and there she went and they were singing this year twisting Roll songs you know what you call going down sing going by I said is that the church and I was standing there and in my heart I was crying and this witch to my notion it's nothing else in the world but she's a she's that World Council of churches leading him right straight down the road where she was going they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side and then the other side and then like that car like at walking and I just started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again and I look and here they come again and they pass by sweet looking little ladies it was all looking right at me as they pass by and I noticed each one was dressed different and one in the back had kind of long hair hanging down and had it rolled around like this might been German or something like that and I watched him and then as he started leaving two or three of them in the back car to get out of step and I was going to holler at him and they's trying to get back and step again and I seen him just the vision just fade out and change from now here is the interpretation thereof the reason I remember I had just got through writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet but in preaching this morning I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice the church only came in view now that's the truth friends the heavenly father who writes the word knows that I tell the truth I don't I just say the truth and not knowing it till just a few minutes ago look like or just recently see did you notice the Bride come in view twice the first seed the second SE both of them exactly the same one and the reason they were dri addressed in different parts she'll come from All Nations it'll make up the rde each one had long hair and no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all Nations see each one repres represent a nation as they March perfectly in line with the word see then I have to watch her she'll get out of Step of that word if I don't watch when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever it is watch they was getting back trying their best getting back this getting line is looking out somewhere else watching about that church and just went out of into chaos but two the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out a little bit to the right hand side it looked like I was trying to get back in line as he went by as this passed me Old Forest here at the wall passed me I was standing there and then I just seen all move out and leave but you notice the church only came into view once each Nation the church but the Bride come in twice see see what it was now not knowing it but look at with my message this morning not knowing that see the seed fell in the ground at NAA that was the original seed and she's come through the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days I will restore see the Masterpiece is brought up that's reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time and she was reviewed the second time and she is perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the green right [Music] quick all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she is Alpha and Omega God the great sculpture has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden took a piece from and made another piece and that was Mar and fell now he's been all this time building it up again and he brought forth this masterpiece and was smitten in order that part that was smitten was in order to bring back again that Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece and the Son of God the Masterpiece and the bride and it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the Lord oh Church of the Living God byow your hearts and your yourselves before God these things are true I know that it sounds like it it's such a greater thing as that would be it would be so spread out over the Nations it never was he doesn't change his way just be thankful Church be thankful that you are where you are today if you're in Christ because you see now and when that remember all that life will be gathered right into the green for the resurrection but the stalk must be burned the rest of it the husk and all must be destroyed and it will be don't trust in you of them denominations you stay in the word the life God and His Masterpiece and what is in the Millennium Christ and his bride back in the garden of the Millennium amen I love him [Music] first love me and puras my Sal on that's where he was smitten we have seen him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity is there any here this morning who isn't in that grain this morning as life is now pulling its last piece from the husk for the husk is drying how many knows that Pentecostal church is drying what is it life is leaving it frankly it's left and if that bride is already in preview I wonder if the bride isn't already made up there love because he first love me and just my Sal with our heads bowed now is there some here that would like to be remembered if you feel that you're not friends it's too plain I've never had a vision in my life L something happened followed I tell the truth all these other times if I've told the truth God has proved it then I tell the truth this time I don't know what day we're living in but I know there's nothing left there couldn't be a politician rise that could straighten this thing out Politics the nation's gone oh God can you can you get down deep enough to to feel that the nation's gone not Nation but Nations this is the best of the bunch and it's gone then if the nations are gone the world's gone and the churches come I my opinion Pentecost was the best they've had but it's gone oh God be merciful to us if you don't know him please hurry hurry if you feel life get out of the get out of your sin get out of the thing that you're in get to the green right quick you'll die in the stalk or in the hus [Music] pray while we sing now love him it's up to you now we have no denomination no nothing we only have Christ you're welcome to worship with him with us till he comes we can't put your name on books we have no books we want your name in The Book of Life you can only do that through birth won't you do it right now ask Christ for New Life bring you in put your name on his book if it's not then you can fellowship with us we love to have you I dear God help each person now to take inventory see if we're in him you loved us you were smitten for us and we did esteem you smitten and Afflicted of God I pray God that you'll call each one Lord speak to my children my loved ones my friends Grant it Lord just now through Jesus Christ's name don't let anybody wait too long

way Lord It's Not Our intention and we realize we're living in such a horrible dark way as we said at the beginning we're walking up a mountain through rugged places dim as a trail but we're packing the light may we see step by step as we go now until we meet like Pilgrims Progress that we finally catch the top of the hill guide us old Shepherd Great Jehovah lead us by thy spirit and we know that we're far from a masterpiece but we're looking where we were hewed from the real Masterpiece and in him we trust just take us to him Lord grant it Lord Heal all the sick people your lord we did him

amen I have enjoyed the Masterpiece praise God Amen let's take a look at our questions now what Parable is brother Brenham using to explain the Masterpiece coming forth if we go to uh paragraph 144 together paragraph 144 on page 27 this is what he says in paragraph 144 I'm using this in a parable now of the Bride the Masterpiece that's coming forth as the Masterpiece fell there is a masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece fell at NAA Rome at NAA after NAA Rome she's come through a process but she's coming right back again to that Masterpiece per perfected cuz she's a part of that word that was spoken by him he'll have a church without spot or wrinkle it did not be connected any way with any kind of organization or denomination the cursed thing it's passed through those things but it will never be there so let's back up a little bit and catch the context he says he's using this as a parable so now let's go look at the parable he just described to the previous page page 26 paragraph 138 says and anybody how many ever seen a seed of wheat start to grow what's the first little thing it's just exactly like the seed but it's the husk see the three stages stalk tossel or the pollen then the husk and then out of the husk Comes The Original Seed not the seed it was the it was the life of the seed growing through this to come to the seed amen amen do you see it what is it a Resurrection coming back to a masterpiece again like the one that went in Pentecost come out of the Wesley because Wesley was an organization Pentecost come out as no organ no organization then it turned to one it had to to make the husk the True Word of Life on it was on its way then to the original grain through these stages through the stalk then into the pollen then from the pollen into the husk and from the husk into the seed no stock tossle husk living they they produced in their early Revival a holder of a certain portion of the seed life but when they organized the life moved on out that's proved by all history never an organization ever done a thing after it organized it was dead that's right Watch The Life is traveling on now it's moving on now bottom the last paragraph on this page paragraph 143 now noticeable this life it's traveling in the corn of wheat then it is the tree God called us people like a tree see the life goes down in the tree and comes back again goes down and comes back up see it goes down and comes back up but in the corn of wheat it goes up from the original stalk through the stalk tossle husk and then the thing has passed through it dies so it can't get back through it again what is it it's no use anymore it goes on to its Perfection now let's go to uh paragraph 152 on the next page page 28 middle of the page paragraph 152 says then out come Wesley he saw the great big organization so he sounded a trumpet of sanctification I'm sorry this paragraph 151 sanctification more of the word than he did out that moved right out of Luther right into Methodist and when Pentecostal saw it they sounded a trumpet it's time for the return of the gifts see see what they did they sounded a trumpet and out they came then they organized but remember after the husk that's three stages we know of there's nothing else left but the grain oh God then the grain is put out of all of it amen seed words begin to form itself life is brought forth notice if the bridegroom the beginning the first bridegroom this is the bride coming forth praise God let's go down to paragraph 154 remember the little pollen is more the tossle is more like the seed than the stalk is and the husk is more like the seed than the tossel was but the seed itself is beyond that it's just it's just used that for transportation to take itself through I want you to catch that it's just use that for transportation to take itself through that's an important sentence now brother Franco can you pull up the Whiteboard for me and uh I just want to draw this out really quickly because brother Brenham is laying down such an important principle that's spanning the entire church ages especially the last three ages he's bringing back the restoration of the wheat and this is the parable that he's used and it's the parable of the seed and he said so let's let's say we draw our ground here this is the ground and he said at Nia Rome that seed fell into the ground so there was a seed a Remnant that fell into the ground and there was a little seed under the ground and in this seed was a part of life the original life and that seed now had to rot it had to die then out of there would come a a root system and up from there would spring forth two little blades in Luther right in that church age in the Lutheran Church age and now that life that was here when it went in the ground now moves and comes up here now the life is here not here anymore right so he's showing there's a progression the life is moving through now now if we go again let's draw our picture now to the next stage now we've got the the root system going we've come up now not just a tassel but we're coming up into a stalk now right and now that life that was in here that was in the blades now come into the stalk and now here we have life right sometimes he calls it a stock sometimes he calls it a to a tossle so sometimes it's it's it's up here in the head when you get the tossle there's where the life is but let's just let's just say that let's say we come up here now the life that was in the seed that's not a very good Arrow Chad now is in the tossel but it's not down here anymore now it's up there and what he's saying is these stages were just transporting the life you can never go backwards in this process and find life anymore that's what he's telling us so you can never go back to the the previous denomination you the Wesleyan couldn't back to the lutherans to find life the Pentecostals couldn't back to the Wesleyan to find life the only way to find life is where the life had moved to in the stage of the growth of the plan so in the tossel age it's only in the tossel you can't go reverse amen all right then he comes up here my I'm really testing my art skills so now we come up here to the up to the tassel now it forms a the head and in the head you have what looks like seed right but it's a husk it's a little Hall that is formed and the seed is a little bud down inside of there and in the Pentecostal Revival here in the head where the husk was there's life not anywhere else it's there but now that's the third stage but that growth was to do what it's going to we got to come back to where now the seed that was down here has got to reproduce itself right there yeah amen all right and when that when that now when that in this little head there's all these little holes but now that that hole cracks open there's actually a seed down inside yeah and in the last stage which you could call the fourth stage life is now in the seed again and when life is in the seed again it is no longer here so you cannot go back to the Pentecostal Edge you cannot go back to the previous Revival coming out of Assa Street to find life anymore now you can only find life in the seed and the seed up here this seed is the same as this seed it's come back to reproduce itself and this seed was was the reflection of the original church that that came forth out on the day of Pentecost not the Pentecostal Revival but the day of Pentecost that's what we're coming back to amen so all of this all of this was just a transportation vehicle yeah to bring the life back to the original life all right thank you brother Frank we can go back to the questions now cuz we're going to get to this later I want that to be a picture in our mind so that we understand when we get a little further down here let's go to the second question what is God doing with his Masterpiece that Michelangelo could not do let's go to paragraph 156 at the top of page 29 why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain it's because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is just a smitten piece off of him there is the Masterpiece it was smitten Michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back once he knocked the chunk off he couldn't put it back but God is going to do it he is going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there in his Masterpiece the family back in the Garden of Eden so what could Michelangelo not do he couldn't take that piece that was broke off put it back but God's going to take the piece that was broke off and he's going to bring it right back in in the in the what in the invisible Union of the the bride and the bridegroom they're going to come back to a marriage what is it it's the word uniting again with the word praise God let's go to paragraph 198 over here on page 36 198 at the bottom of page 36 all others were appear no more they went out never to come back again but the Bride come back cuz she was Alpha and Omega the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden he took a piece from and made another piece and that was marred and fell now he's been all this time building it up again he brought forth his Masterpiece and was smitten that part that was smitten was in order to bring back again the Masterpiece so he can bring them back again praise God question number three how is the bride going to be restored to the side of the the bridegroom so only God can make this restoration how is she going to come back let's go to back to page 29 and go to the middle of the page there on paragraph 158 how is this bride going to do this how is this weat going to do this Malachi 4 said in the last day it' be restored back what restored back like the beginning take it back what to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers so how is she going to come back she has to come back through the prophecy of Malachi 4 that's the only way that's the way that this sculptor is going to take the peace and unite it back again he's going to do it through the prophecy of Malachi 4 oh praise God aren't you glad you know what that prophecy is you know how it's been fulfilled all right restore back like in the beginning take it back I will restore sayith the Lord all the years the Palmer worm the cankerworm and all these other things has eaten I will restore again again Malachi 4 said he will restore the hearts of the people and the faith of the people back to the original fathers again we see this right before us Church where are we at uh next paragraph now closing in a few minutes I want you to notice real close to something that just happened he's referring to the vision he's going to tell at the end Malachi for is to bring back back to the original she is smitten from the church from I'm sorry I'm going to get into that later but Malachi 4 is to bring back to the original let's go to paragraph 166 on the next page page 30 now at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original life back to the Bible Malachi 4 said it would be brought back that way oh my must have all to be this way it must have all the word so how is she going to come back remember Michelangelo couldn't do it but God's going to do it how's he going to do it he's going to do it through Malachi 4 what's it going to take in order to be reunited she has to have all the word again so it's going to take the opening of The Seven Seals the taking the veil off the word and restoring the word to the church that'll actually be the glue that cements these pieces back together let's read it'll have to be it must have all of the word is that right now what did he say in Revelation 10 that would take place see he talked about bringing back through Malachi 4 now he goes right to Revelations 10 because Revelation 10 1:7 and Malachi 4 are the same thing so Revelation 10 that would take place why was the trip to Tucson what's the trip to Tucson that's when he went out west to get the revelation of the Seven Seals to open to the church in the days of the messenger of the seventh angel the seventh angel message the whole word of God would be manifest the seal what seal would that be the seal that what all the stalk is left off why and all about it would be made manifest in this time is that what the word said then we see it then where are we at see where are we at there is only one thing the Harvest is here she is dead ripe she is ready now for the coming amen keep reading now now it'll never be at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original condition and must have all of the word in order to be the seed now you can't have half a seed it won't grow it's got to be the whole seed it's got it got to not manifest I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I believe in speaking in tongues that's just part of the seed but now there is added to that Hallelujah the life not the gifts the life of the gifts see see what I mean we're at the end time Brethren stalk tossle husk is dead and dry now there is only one thing that has to happen to that is to the to be gathered in the world Council of churches for its burning the word has become flesh exactly like he promised in in Luke 17 Malachi 4 and all see that's right Revelations all true life that was in the stock tossel husk is now gathering in the seed ready for the resurrection ready for the Harvest the alpha has become Omega amen the first come last and the last is the first the seed that went in has come through a process and become the seed again praise God he's not saying it will he's saying it has it is all the way back then he's saying it's right because why the word has come back amen now let's go to paragraph 213 all the way on page 39 and we and we know that we're far from a masterpiece but we're looking where we were hewed from the real Masterpiece and in him we trust this is not us saying I'm perfect now no no no but he showed me the real Masterpiece and he showed me by the opening of this word he showed me the part that was hued out and by Revelation he told me I'm that part that was HED out and now I'm not looking to myself I'm looking to the Masterpiece and I'm looking to the word I'm looking to Malachi 4 and I'm looking to Revelation 10:7 and I'm looking to the prophecy and I'm realizing he's putting me back in my place amen not our strength but his word all right question four what makes the husband and wife truly a family let's go to paragraph 1 76 I thought this was phenomenal uh page 31 all the way to the bottom page 31 at the bottom paragraph 176 notice the Great Masterpiece of the family the husband and the wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one way the husband another that would make an awful family but but in agreement with love one to another that's a family and now that was God's Masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that so we're talking spiritually now about the spiritual family the husband and wife the bridegroom and the bride but it works it translate right down to our families what makes a good family is when the F husband and wife are not pulling in two different directions but they're one amen what makes them one is that they have a single Vision yeah amen that's what makes them one and men and what makes the great bridegroom and the bride one and the Masterpiece is because by the revelation of the word they share the same vision because the message is open to us the word of God and now that's why a denomination can never come to the marriage because the denomination can't be one with the bridegroom because they don't have all the word and they have addon ideas and man's Concepts and that can never come into a perfect union to be a perfect Masterpiece family with the bride bridegroom it would take the full revelation of the full word and of people who submit to that and come into that image is the only way the Masterpiece family can be United together again they have to be one if he was the word she has to be the word if he was the word made manifest she has to be the word made manifest praise God all right last question what did beeo and do in the process of making a masterpiece let's go to paragraph 184 on the next page on page 33 that is amen there is a man that's speaking to brother brandham a minister and and he says I was standing there in the hall I guess sister down and them after I shook hands with Bill and standing there and all went around the corner and the whole bunch of people a minister pressed his way and caller turned around and he said why is it that you're always balling the people out he said then people believe you to be a servant of God and be gentle and sweet to them and everything said every time I hear you get up you're balling women out about having short hair and about wearing shorts and wearing makeup and all this other stuff and balling the people out and tell them how cold and formal and different they are said why do you do that said then people love you how can you be a loving Son of God and do a thing like that I thought Lord let me answer this smart man see you just let me answer him somewhere that'll hang him on his own rope I said well I said sir did you ever read of the great producer of Music the great composer called Beethoven he said oh sure I read of Beethoven I said he probably tore up a waste basket full of scrap paper but he give the world masterpieces he never opened his mouth and said another word I said when we was sitting in his study under the inspiration he would write something down he'd go into a study and pray it wasn't right he'd scrap it up and throw it in the waist basket but when he got through in all inspiration the world had a masterpiece oh how the word Cuts but it produces masterpieces takes all the husk and stalk away it brings forth masterpieces praise God has the word cut you oh how the word Cuts but it produces masterpieces in order to get the Masterpiece of Moses there was a lot of hammering and chiseling and sawing and cutting and breaking and rubbing and irritation but it produced to the world a masterpiece oh there's been a lot of scrap pieces come out of my life but I'm praying God will turn this this hunk of stone or dirt into a masterpiece One Day by his grace let's go to paragraph 217 on page 40 2117 on page 40 says mold us and make us Sons and Daughters of God we believe the bride is getting its last polishing down it'll be spitten from the complete organization all together then the Great Harvest will be here now let's go to 218 now do you understand why I scold you that ain't because I I love you not because I don't love you I do love you I want masterpieces for the master I might have to tear a few out like this but it'll I I'll have a masterpiece some of these days if I keep it right on this word praise God remember brother BM now went into the vision back here and he began to describe the vision of he saw the bride coming forth and when he began that he said I may not know just the right interpretation and he begins talking and he saw the bride coming into preview and she was beautiful and she was perfect in every way and she passed off off the scene and now the voice said now the church will come and he said all the vulgarity and the filth and his heart like to drop then the American Church came and he just couldn't take it anymore and and in other place he said he just bowed his head and he wept and he couldn't take it and then they went off into chaos following a wit but then the voice said but the bride will come into preview once more and then he saw again the sweet faces and those clean women coming forth and and he began to describe the two one was completely uncovered and and and they were they were vulgar and filthy and they were led by a witch and they were moving and twisting to the wrong kind of music and and and they were uncovered because they didn't have the word all they had was a little gray gray piece of paper that was cut to make a fly bush to expand it bigger than they was and that's just the Creeds and dogmas of man amen but when he saw the bride he said it's amazing he said she had long skirts and long sleeves what's he saying she was fully covered she was completely covered by the word amen and so and she was marching to Onward Christian Soldiers and and and then he says but I caught it right in my preaching today he didn't have the interpretation when he had the vision but while he's preaching he said I had that before I had these notes he said but I caught it in the preaching this morning it's the alpha omega principle it's the seed that went in and the seed at the end but nothing in between it was all just a carrier but it would all go to complete death the stalk the tossle the husk amen you would only have life at the beginning and life at the end the bride that went into the uh ground and the bride that come forth is the same bride it's the alpha omega principle aren't you glad you're not in the husk age you're not in the stalk age yeah you're not in a tossel age but God has brought us forth in the seed age the wheat age the life age oh I'm so thankful I'm not worthy of it I don't deserve it and I don't always act like it but I am so thankful for it and I'm not looking to myself but I'm looking to that hued out place at Calvary where he struck him at Calvary and brought me out and I know he's going to take me right back and it'll be a perfect fit when he's done polishing this Stone thank God Almighty amen I just want to I want to highlight just this a couple other things if I could and then we'll be done uh paragraph 200 paragraph 200 on page 37 page 37 paragraph 200 oh Church of the Living God bow your hearts and yourselves before God these things are true I know that it sounds like that as such a great thing as that would be would be so spread over the Nations it never was he doesn't change his ways just be thankful Church be thankful that you are where you are today if you're in Christ how many's thankful that you're sitting here tonight listening to the Masterpiece that God has given you ears to hear and eyes to see and mean it's not it's not everywhere known it's not everywhere accepted but praise God I'm so thankful that I can see and I can hear I'm just thankful you know one other note brother Brenham he he he attaches the Harvest Time and the husk drying he says it excommunicates the seed and he ties it right to Revelation 3 when he was on the outside knocking trying to get back in and he shows that no other age no other Church age does that describe like it is in Revelation 3 why because through every Church age the life was was moving through it was transporting the life bringing it back to grain but at the very end in the last age when it goes back to grain there's no more transporting needed there's no more now what does the church age do now at the end time the Pentecostal age that husk opens up and it excommunicates him that's right who is the word and then he says this bride will be smitten from denomination she'll be cast out why because she is becoming the word she's becoming him she's the word made manifest that's why she's rejected from the whole lot not because she's not rejected because she has a nasty temperament and a bad attitude she's rejected because she's become the word and that denominational system cannot hold the word because they're done with the transportation they're done the seed is already formed praise God now let's go to paragraph 211 this is the last comment I'd like to make on page 39 page 39211 I just want to point this out I just love the way the prophet prays he says I don't know how to pray can you imagine being the prophet of the age and claiming you don't know how to pray I don't know how to pray we're talking to the Mighty God and what human being is there what Mortal could make the righte type of prayer before the Living God that's right but Lord in my mispronounced words and my nouns and pronouns in the wrong place if you could pick out the ABCs for a little boy one day and make a sentence you can omit my nouns and pronouns and just look to what I believe Lord I believe you I believe this word and I'm believing for each one here I just love that that did something for me brother B wasn't trying to impress anybody by his prayer he knew he was standing before a living God and he said what can a mortal say to the almighty God he just humbly just begin to speak from his heart and we may not be good at praying but being good at praying and having a good prayer are two different things right amen there's some people who are good at praying all yeah they sound good praying yeah but that may not be a good prayer the good prayer may not sound so good may not be eloquent it may not be smooth but it's honest from the heart amen and that's a good prayer and sometimes the best prayer is God I don't even know what to say or how to say it right but you know what I need would you please help me that may be the best prayer the that may be the most eloquent prayer we've ever prayed amen God I have no idea how you going to say it right but may the spirit speak with groanings that cannot be uttered amen man God bless you let's all stand musicians if you'll come brother John if you please make your way up I have enjoyed the Masterpiece I think what should we be doing brother Chad just keep looking to that place you were hewed out of which is Christ The Living Word of God you keep focused on that place we were hewed out of because that's where he's bringing us back to to fit right into the word I think it's glorious what a blessed day to be alive and God bless you all it's been a pleasure to go through the Masterpiece together let's bow our heads together and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness to us for your mercy and Grace in bringing us this message Lord there's so many ears that haven't heard or they heard with natural ears but had no ears in their soul to hear God we're just so grateful we're so thankful that you've allowed us to have ears to hear eyes to see and a heart to perceive and God we want to hear more and we want to see more we want to become more into your image than we were the day before Lord would you just look to our heart and see the desire in our heart and bring us into that image would you mold us Lord and finish polishing Us in this end time and bring us back into the place we were smitten from bring us back lord connected to the word back in Union with your word back in Harmony and submission May that word flow through us may you live your own life and each one of us Lord we're so thankful that we've heard this tonight may it transfer Lord from a hearing to a life from a listening together to a tape to the manifestation of what was said inside of us Lord and only you can make that transfer we don't have the power in ourselves all we can can do is receive it and believe it but we need you to make it live inside of us Lord you had an alpha bride and you promised you'll have an Omega bride God We Believe by Faith by a revelation you planted in our hearts that we're part of that Omega bride but God just as the prophet was seeing in the end that maybe that bride was out of step and he was hollering get back in Step God may we heed that voice of the prophet and may we get in step with your word help us not to look around at the circumstances or the false church or any other church or even anybody else but help us keep our eyes focused on that gift you sent in this day to keep us straight and in line with your word help us father we're trusting in you guide us Lord mold us make us you're the Craftsman you're the sculptor you're the great artist we're trusting in you to finish the work in US in Jesus Christ's name we pray bless all of those that are here Lord as we travel home keep us safe and help us to be the manifestation you've called for in this hour in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you I just want to remind you my family and I will be traveling this weekend down to West Virginia we
