How many believe he will according to his promise? Phyllis. Amen. And as you can see, we have a guest minister this morning. Amen. Brother Ruben Matany from Romania. And uh God just worked out all the circumstances last minute. And uh he's he's able to be with us and it's quite a blessing. We didn't know it, didn't confirm it till Friday night, so I couldn't tell you earlier, but it's a pleasant surprise. Amen. He he and his brother Norbert, they drove up from Cincinnati last night in a snowstorm. Amen. And it was worse down there than up here. So, we're glad they arrived safely. They got in about 9:30 uh last evening, but we're just glad that they're here with us. Uh brother Ruben's father, Gabriel Matany, is a good friend of mine. I've been to Romania, been with them, been in their home, been in Reuben's home before. Amen. And uh they they're quite friends of ours. And many of you will remember brother Gabrielle was here 3 years ago and ministered here and uh was quite a blessing to the assembly here. And so now Reuben's here. Reuben, this is his first time in the United States. He never dreamed of being here and God just worked out all the circumstances. Norbert's been here several times. God bless you, brother Norbert. His his work brings him over. He's got a client in Cincinnati. He sees from time to time. And when he's there, he drives up and visits with us. So, he's been here a few times. But for Reuben in the back, he told me, he said, "If you would have told me a month ago, I would have come, I wouldn't have believed you. But God just worked it out. And so, I'm just thankful that he can be here with us and he could take the service for us. And we just pray that God will bless him." Amen. I've watched Brother Ruben when I've been in Romania several times. He's a workhorse. Amen. He's always working. He's the audiovisisual technical guy. He's associate minister and he's the main camp director for their camp they do every summer. So this brother works and he's a big help to the saints there in Romania. And he's a blessing to his local church. And so we thank God for him. And he's young. He's 34 years old. So I asked him, I said, "You've been preaching what, 5, 6 years?" No, 17 years. He started when he was 17, 18 years old. So I was like, "Wow, praise God." You can never underestimate anybody. Amen. So I've also asked him to take the youth meeting this afternoon and share some of his experiences. Amen. With our young people. So we're looking forward to that. Also want to say we appreciate Brother Joseph again for cleaning up the parking lot. This has been an active winter so far, brother. Amen. It's been a blessing. Amen. And when he volunteered to help, he was taken once, twice a year, like the last few. He didn't know it was going to be a full-time job. And then brother Elmer Schwarz came by early this morning and resulted. And then when I pulled in, Brother Dean and Xavier were going around and hitting walks and spots. So I just appreciate those brothers making it easy for the rest of us. I thank God for watching over us. And I'm so glad the storm ended early last night. I was so happy. Thank God. Amen. You know how I feel about Saturday night snowstorms. Amen. But God is good. So, we're just going to invite brother Ruben to come. We want him to be able to relax, but his ability to relax depends on our ability to pull. And I know how it is when he can slip into that channel where he's no longer in control and God's flowing cuz we're feeding. Amen. That's when it'll become comfortable for him. So, I want to help him get into that spot early. Amen. So, God bless you. We're going to invite him with the song with the Riley. &gt;&gt; Are among us for we have gatherred in your name. We can feel your presence in this place. You are here among us. You are enthralled upon our grace. You are here here to heal and here to save. For you are here in our midst.

I would like to greet everyone in the house of God. You can take your seats just for a few seconds just to to introduce myself. I'm very happy and honored to be among you. And uh as I said, brother Chad, I for me it was quite I mean to come to United States, but I'm happy that the Lord made the way also my brother. He he he played a great step to to drive me here and to bring me. So I appreciate him also. I'm so thankful father Chad that he opened the pullpit for us. Uh I know it's it's a great responsibility and trust and we don't take it like we deserve it. We take it like uh something that we appreciate is so high. Uh my language is a little bit not so good but I try to express myself and just to be a blessing to you. Amen. I am brother Ruben. I'm I'm married since 13 years. The Lord bless us with two daughters and we we press on and we we we just press on in the message of the hour because we know there is a great reward. Amen. So we don't believe in vain. This message have an expected end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have a we don't know what to expect. It have an expected end. &gt;&gt; And you you and I I thought the church is quite full this morning and I said sac uh worship is sacrifice. Sometimes it takes sacrifice to worship and you come up in this cold weather just to show on on which side you stand and we we by the grace of the Lord we we we we just press on to bring greetings from my dad our pastor brother Gabriel Matani. He send all all to you special greetings to brother Chad. And I want to let you know when brother Chad is traveling he's a great blessing. So don't be sad when he comes you you share the blessing what you have here with us. So, so, so just we appreciate him and we wait him in our country back and uh this is this is the message that we believe and the revelation we share. We are in the same linemen &gt;&gt; and we know it's nothing else but the truth &gt;&gt; and we can put all our trust our hearts on it because it's no it's more than enough &gt;&gt; to make the rapture. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So I'm just happy to be with you with my brother and may the Lord bless you. Amen. And if you want to stand, we want to to to read from the scripture. We want to read from Hebrews 12 verse1. And we want to take a title this morning, author and the finisher of our faith. The author and the finisher of our faith. Amen. Amen. Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin or unbelief which don't so easily beset us. And let us run with patient the race that is set before us. &gt;&gt; It's a race that is already set. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are living a life by design this morning. &gt;&gt; You have a race that is set before you &gt;&gt; and it's not set by a man because sometimes we like humans we we give our our minds and we change our minds and if you are good to me I like you but if tomorrow you but God is different &gt;&gt; he's not taking his word back. &gt;&gt; And what Amen. I don't want to keep you stand but amen. Looking unto Jesus. Amen. looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that has before him had endured the cross, this discip the the shame, and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. If you want to open also Psalms 121 verse 7. 101 121 verse7. Amen. The Lord shall preserve. &gt;&gt; You cannot preserve. &gt;&gt; But it's somebody who in this dark age is preserving. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil, &gt;&gt; from all unbelief. You cannot fall from the message because the Lord preserve you. &gt;&gt; And Bible says, "He shall preserve thy soul." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise blessed be the name of the Lord. And and verse eight says, "The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in &gt;&gt; from this time on and forever more. And if you throw a line and put you know total we can say the Lord is taking care of our journey. &gt;&gt; If you want to bow your heads heavenly father Lord maybe we don't have much on this earth but we have you &gt;&gt; and you are everything. You are the author of the eternal life. You are the author of of of everything what is good. So we come before your throne of grace and mercy and we would like to say h how great you are. Thank you Lord for the message of the hour. Thank you for the revelation. Thank you that Lord you set a race before us and you are not leaving us alone. You preserve us. Lord Jesus we we please bless the the reading of the word. Bless the preaching of the word. Help me to to step aside and may may it be a blessing this morning for your children. May they will be encouraged. May the ones that are sick to be healed. May the ones that are discouraged to be encouraged. May the one that are weak to be strengthened. Lord, we believe but that by the preaching of the word all things are possible. Lord we appreciate you and we commit our hands and lives in your hand. Bless Israel, your people. And thank you Lord that as you keep Israel, you keep your bride. Lord Jesus, with us, commit everything and we call upon your name. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You can take your seats. Amen. So, Amen. We want to to share a few words this morning. The author and the finisher of our faith. Amen. I want also to take uh to read from 2 Timothy 23. 2 Timothy 2:13. If the Bible says and sometimes I mean if we believe not that yet he abide faithful &gt;&gt; and the reason is and this the reason of your life is he cannot deny himself. &gt;&gt; So you are not just an ordinary some &gt;&gt; he cannot deny himself. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God this morning. So the Bible says here looking unto Jesus we have a race before us we have and sometimes our life our journey of our lives sometimes we are not sure what's happening but to this morning I want to encourage you from the Bible Paul says the race is set &gt;&gt; not but somebody it's God himself &gt;&gt; who is out of time I want to take I I want to if you want to take in consideration Eternity is not influenced by time. &gt;&gt; Time is affected by external factors. &gt;&gt; Time is affected by a lot of things. But eternity cannot be touched. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So there is something the author and the finisher of our faith. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I like this. I like this Bible from David. David realized David went through a lot of struggles. David had a was a man of of of battles. David had a lot of sorrows, a lot of and at the end he realized he lifts up his hand and he realized humanly I cannot keep myself. I cannot keep my faith. I cannot keep my belief. And he says the Lord shall preserve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Romania we have a custom uh if you want to preserve, we make some pickles. You had to put some ingredients that would preserve the vegetables &gt;&gt; and whatever is coming those vegetables uh are preserved &gt;&gt; uh in order to resist all through the year. &gt;&gt; There is some ingredients and the receipt to preserve those vegetables. &gt;&gt; And there is something special to preserve the bride in this age. You cannot be preserved by any other belief only by the message of the hour by the revealed word. This will preserve you till the end and the rapture will not be a surprise for you. &gt;&gt; You expect it &gt;&gt; because God is not coming for and he is who God is not coming for volunteers. &gt;&gt; He's coming for son and daughters of God. Right. &gt;&gt; So if God is prepared, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; you are also prepared. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; because God is is blessed be the name of the Lord. So I love this. He shall preserve thy soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. And if we believe not this fle this flesh is always an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Don't try to make him believer. &gt;&gt; You have to declare war with this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You cannot this is not our friend. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't look for enemies around. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is our brother Bram said this is our greatest enemy &gt;&gt; but there is something stronger &gt;&gt; than this flesh. So sometimes you know we got discouraged because we have a lot of thoughts in our mind and the problem is we don't identify the source of the thoughts &gt;&gt; and sometimes you got discouraged oh lord I maybe I thought bad about this brother or sister or we had some you know the the problem is we have to identify the source &gt;&gt; and say lord I don't want to have these thoughts I don't want to have this greater is he that is in me &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and once you identify the source you are overcomer So if you want to be overcomer this morning, let's let's look to Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now to understand in human life there are several things and I can I can call it author or creator or manufacturer. A manufacturer a it's a company or business they make some products some some things. A creator is somebody who brings something new in existence or an author is something or or a a creator or maybe a writer. But I want to what I want to highlight in human life we trust the manufacturer by the products they make. &gt;&gt; So I never if you if you go and buy a car you don't you don't drive after one year and bring it back and say I don't like this. you buy, you go and search for a car because you trust that manufacturer and you believe that that will fit your need. &gt;&gt; When you go to a shop, you look for a, for example, a chocolate. You look for a special brand because you trust that and you know this is good. &gt;&gt; You don't go to the shop and try every chocolate brand and this is they will take you out from the shop soon. you and this this I want to say this trust on the manufacturer or on any brand is built from is built from I can call it uh from the word somebody told you this is good &gt;&gt; and you started to trust that word &gt;&gt; so basically basically when you take a book you don't read it first and then you say oh I don't like it I give it back people search for books for a special with a special author because they trust trust that they trust that author and say, "Oh, I want to read those books from that auth they they trust that author." Is that right? So basically basically the product we trust the product of the manufacturer &gt;&gt; and because of that we give credit to the manufacturer and say this is a good brand, this is a good company. uh sometimes we have some I don't want to say but from other countries some lower products you don't trust them that's right say I don't want that but you have something good said yes I trust &gt;&gt; so so our story start with another outer &gt;&gt; that is Jesus &gt;&gt; and I I I like it when when the angel came to brotherham the first thing he wanted to identify his source and the And and he said because the source the source is very important. You trust the source and you know if things come from a certain source or manufacturer that things are good. &gt;&gt; So we learned that the Bible says there is a faith whose author and finisher is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So we say when the angel of the Lord came to brother Arab he said don't be afraid I coming with a I'm coming with a message from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message is not is not from a source of a of a human. &gt;&gt; It's from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; It's from the presence of God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Brother Abraham says in super sign there was one named Moses who believed in a supernatural God. He met him and talked to him in a supernatural way at a supernatural bush. Uh had a supernatural fire on a on a bush. He got a supernatural message. He got a supernatural message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One man going down, one man invasion, take over Egypt, a supernatural message. But it was from a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we tend to make this message natural. Don't degrade the message. &gt;&gt; Let it be supernatural. &gt;&gt; A natural message cannot be can can't be understood by natural people. Supernatural message can be understood by supernatural people. &gt;&gt; So don't make this message natural. Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot prove a supernatural message to a natural people &gt;&gt; because they want always to figure it out everything because supernatural is overnatural. &gt;&gt; You cannot prove supernatural with natural because then you you you lower the quality. Leave the message supernatural &gt;&gt; because the message makes you a supernatural people, a supernatural race. That's why Hebrews says we have come closer to a supernatural church. &gt;&gt; There is a super there is a crowd of witnesses. The church of the &gt;&gt; first born. &gt;&gt; That church of the firstborn is a church made of supernatural people out of sons and daughters of God. So don't try to lower them the quality of the message, the quality of revelation. Keep it supernatural. Sometimes we tend to prove the message but the message is already proved &gt;&gt; because because you are not a you you are not a natural man with a with an with a heavenly experience. You are a supernatural being having a natural experience but not losing the the the purpose and the plan of God. And that's why Satan is asking himself, what's happening? How eternity can drop down in a body called time? But I'm so happy. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Whatever God does &gt;&gt; for for for his for his supernatural people, he could not send a natural message. &gt;&gt; He sent them a supernatural message. So in in this morning I want to encourage you don't sometimes we hear and if you are honest with us and uh sometimes we try that we pretend we understand everything but sometimes inside of us maybe we have some struggles but this morning tell to your struggles you don't need to understand because it's supernatural &gt;&gt; because he that is in me this message is for him &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the lord a supernatural message sent to supernatural race supernatural bride and natural cannot defeat supernatural. That's right. &gt;&gt; There is no power around to defeat the supernatural because that's above &gt;&gt; and everything what is above is higher is stronger is greater and this message is greater than your unbelief. This message is greater than your problem. This message is greater than your struggle and this me and the rapture cannot be stopped. Brother and sister your I want to be respectful but your unbelief cannot stop the the rapture &gt;&gt; because if in this we have a lot of struggles he remains a believer he cannot deny himself &gt;&gt; and the rapture is not for for just somebody the rapture is for sons and daughters of God &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the lord &gt;&gt; amen happy this morning &gt;&gt; amen amen 11:1 says what is faith. Sometimes we have an understanding that faith is like a we put it from a shelf and we we we ask God give me faith faith faith. This is other church have this mentality. They're praying for faith. Give me faith. Give me faith. But we want to say this morning Hebrew 11 it's the chapter of the overcomers. And it it says by faith by faith by faith. None of them none of everybody of them have something in common and is that faith and that faith was not taken from a shelf. They were born with that faith &gt;&gt; and that their birth uh shows the reality. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So Hebrew 11:1 says faith is the substance. &gt;&gt; Amen. the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; Now this word substance stands for for the essense is like the chemical is the core. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So God cannot be cannot uh go God is he always believes &gt;&gt; in God there is no unbelief. &gt;&gt; Right? So, brother Bram says and and we will read this quote, "God believes for you." &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't believe for us, but God believes for you. &gt;&gt; What a special people to to this morning. &gt;&gt; Glory. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I I hope somebody is not somebody's happy because there is a author and a finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He shall preserve my soul. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I thought we lost. We are lost. Sometimes we thought we will we will uh give up but we cannot give up &gt;&gt; because you are himself &gt;&gt; and the Bible says he cannot deny himself. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that we have a sure salvation? &gt;&gt; And Paul comes and he says for the early change early age for the early change he said you cannot understand but it will it will come a group of people that we will present you perfect. &gt;&gt; We will we will we will come come to this soon. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But Abraham says in a trumpet gives an uncertain sound. There he remained upon that word showing us an example. Uh he says I have given you time is running fast so we want to I have given you an example and that is an example that we should uh we should be perfectly put our trust in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Put our trust in the word in the word of God. Let everything else be alive. Let every that's the one thing that's certain. God made the promise. God is going to keep the promise. They say how can these things happen. How can a how how he get a bunch of people together with rapturing grace to go up. I don't know how will he will do it. It's not my business to ask how he will do it. It's my business just to be ready for it. &gt;&gt; He promised it. is going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fortified with his church by the word. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Ephesians church age brother says her righteousness is in his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Her attributes are his own attributes. Her identity is found in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look around and we try to identify with that that that and it says still not working. But when you start to identify with the message, &gt;&gt; it comes to rest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So if you want to come to rest tonight, this morning try uh uh surrender and identify in him. Your identity is found in him. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we want to look for for this subject, the author and the finisher of our faith. Blessed be the name of the Lord. the the the the author is not stand just by by a composer that he he he he he do something but this word in Greek is uh archaos and this is this this stands for uh author captain captain or prince or a person who is originator and founder your fate is not from from you your phrase Your faith is coming from a different source. It's is the the founder. It's God. &gt;&gt; The eternal brothers describes God the eternal fountain of God who was filling the universe. He stepped in a in a body called logos in a body called uh in a in a light body and all that was in God poured was poured in Christ. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And the pillar of fire is the originator of our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to highlight pillar of fire is light. &gt;&gt; Have you ever saw somebody uh that uh darkness to take over light &gt;&gt; but the Bible says light have overcome darkness. &gt;&gt; And but the Bible says your children are from the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your father is the light. &gt;&gt; That's why if you are part of the logos, your light cannot be shut down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever problem comes in your life, whatever sit situation, you will kept shining. &gt;&gt; Tell to your darkness around, I will keep shining. &gt;&gt; Tell to the world around, I will keep shining. Even if your family is not a good condition, say to yourself, I will keep shining because the source of my light is not a natural light because this will fade out. But if the source is the pillar of fire, you cannot be defeated. &gt;&gt; You cannot be defeated. And even if you go to trials this morning, you cannot be defeated. And sometimes we try we try uh we try proofs but in the time of Noah he could not have proof. They was looking for clouds no clouds they were looking but what was the proof? The end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the proof of the message will be the transformation. &gt;&gt; So even if this morning you don't have something that you can rely this on this flesh re does trust. I I know this message will result in the transformation which will result in in in in eternity. &gt;&gt; That's why don't don't sometimes we are we are in in in human sometimes we try to relay on something and you say oh I felt I felt good I felt safe tomorrow maybe you fall down break the leg then you are bad you know our experiences affects our bodies. But the inside &gt;&gt; it cannot be affected by natural things &gt;&gt; because it's just supernatural. &gt;&gt; It's it's coming from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; So the out I like to highlight this the out and the finisher is the same. &gt;&gt; Sometime churches tense that God is the author but the church is the finisher. &gt;&gt; And they come and they say yes it's good but we will show how to finish the race. But I have a message that showed me how to finish the race. And if you want to make sure you will be finished the race, look to him. The author and the finisher of your faith. &gt;&gt; I'm happy that the my faith is what not start not started in a church because churches can come and can go but your faith in the message of the hour have not started because if started with end but if it's coming from eternity will never end. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to highlight something in Hebrew 12:12. Author and the finisher. In other words, upon your faith is not an intervention. Faith doesn't need a human intervention. He the Bible Paul wanted to want to highlight to show the complete work, the complete vision of God. He's the author and the finisher. In other words, he is in control from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; Can you understand why brother Abraham says God is incomplete &gt;&gt; without you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if somebody of you is missing, then his work is not complete. &gt;&gt; And he cannot afford &gt;&gt; just to think how precious you are in the sight of God. people around maybe don't give nothing on you but God give everything on you &gt;&gt; because it's about it's his work in in in in on on in in in charge is his work his word in charge not your word &gt;&gt; so Bible says he's the author and the finisher &gt;&gt; of our faith &gt;&gt; that's why your faith cannot dim out &gt;&gt; and can your faith is the same blessed be the name of the lord So when you look this shows a complete work a complete vision a complete purpose and the our the author said from the beginning it is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So when he looked to the faith that he placed in in this church &gt;&gt; he said they will be overcomer till the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And we never knew this. A church came to us and says you have to raise your hand to be and that's all good but when the message the revelation came to us he said you was always saved &gt;&gt; you are not saved you know if if I just come and tell you you are always saved sometimes it looks strange but we when we go slowly and realize the perfect plan of God the perfect plan of salvation &gt;&gt; then you you realize it's not your salvation &gt;&gt; God is coming to Moses. Israel is Israelis was in at the Red Sea and God is looking to them and said why are you crying? Why are you uh like uh why are you tearing for the why are you doing this this not I have taken you &gt;&gt; and I will take you in the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord I thought we will have to take us to the land. But God said to Moses, &gt;&gt; "What's all this crying and all the &gt;&gt; I'm taking to the land." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bram said, "People are fighting against the will of God." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's let's just let's just step on this boat of grace, the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; and surrender to it completely. &gt;&gt; This will take you through. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. So we want to see uh there is not intervention at the beginning. I will start I'm the author. Somebody will have to handle some things and then I will finish. &gt;&gt; God is not repairing things. &gt;&gt; Because if you repair something then he's not God. &gt;&gt; So you cannot be repaired &gt;&gt; because if I mean your salvation &gt;&gt; it's a finished work. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Paul is Paul had a revelation. He met the pillar of fire and he says I come you to make you no he said I come to declare. &gt;&gt; So we have also declaration. &gt;&gt; Declaration. Amen. So the author said it is finished. This means it has full warranty. They have, you know, uh for commercial things they they invented extended warranty but this still expires because they know they they know that the things will break. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they pretend ah lifetime warranty but this still not really works &gt;&gt; because everything what is in time depends on external factors &gt;&gt; on external conditions. &gt;&gt; Right? But this faith &gt;&gt; have an author because of the source. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It cannot be stopped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It cannot be removed. &gt;&gt; It cannot be changed. &gt;&gt; It stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say this morning, I will stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will stand. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Do you know why? So we understand but Abraham says all hell is against this revelation. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; But you this morning if you look around you are for this revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that mean you are so powerful and sometimes we think we are overwhelmed. We are over but if you can resist to all hell &gt;&gt; because it's not you it's greater he that is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, so this faith have the author because of the source. That's why we can sing blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; Blessed assurance, blessed salvation, it belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. The other thing that I want to highlight when in this in this products uh selling society, there is a uh uh uh when when you buy this ex extended warranty, you are having rest till you have this warranty. But once your fridge is out of warranty, you pray not to break the fridge because you are not covered. So in warranty is peace. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; You you you to be honest sometimes after we we buy something and after 5 years we would like to break to get a new one. Sometimes it happens you know you look you don't break some electricity power to this is you know but as long as you have warranty you have peace and you know not you are taking care of the product. You just you have a hotline and you call the manufacturer, take your fridge and bring a new one because and you say because it's in warranty. It's in &gt;&gt; warranty. Amen. &gt;&gt; The company is responsible to have it up and running till it's in warranty. &gt;&gt; But when the warranty break up, you lost your piece. You always check the light in the fridge is going good. Next time you lost your peace, you your life's become in struggle. But we but we have your your faith, your trust in the message of the hour. This is guaranteed. &gt;&gt; This will not vex out. &gt;&gt; Because this is coming from a source that is the pillar of fire, the logos. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are not going out from warranty. It's guaranteed eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message of the hour, eternity is guaranteed. That's why we can say we can tr our eternity what Abraham says our eternity it's it lays on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So are you are you happy tonight? &gt;&gt; Uh this this morning we have not just an extended warranty we have an eternal guarantee. Yeah, &gt;&gt; God will take as we read, God will take care of your incoming and of your outgoing. &gt;&gt; Basically, this message of the hour made us to look to him and to make this message makes us to worship him because he made the things so perfect. He made things so great &gt;&gt; and sometimes humanity mind cannot grasp it but inside of you is saying nothing else but the truth. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Brother Abraham says in four words is faith expressed. And he promised you the same thing. If you could believe that would happen. If you can't believe it, it just won't happen. Now, brother Bram says, I cannot make you believe. Neither can you make yourself believe. Sometimes we we we we tend to believe that our experiences oh yes I believe because once you said this is not a matter of belief because you have a proof. &gt;&gt; So if you have a proof it's not a belief because the Bible says in Hebrew 11 faith is the things not seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So brother Abraham says God has got to give it to you. &gt;&gt; It's a gift of God to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not your faith, God faith. &gt;&gt; Your intellectual faith might believe it, it fine. But unless the faith of God is down in your heart, see your int intellectual faith can accept it. Do that and just keep having it on all your heart until God reveals it to you. &gt;&gt; Let's slow down. Faith needs revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So re brother Abraham says until God's revealed it to you. See just keep believing until God does reveal it to you. So brother says not until God's give it to you or until you receive it. He just reveal it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means it's already in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, what you need for the rapture, it's already in you. It's already in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we we we we needed the word, the revelation to present us the perfect work of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Psalms 102:26 says, Psalms 26, they will perish, but you remain. &gt;&gt; They will all wear out like a garment, like clothing. You will change them and they will pass on. But you remain the same &gt;&gt; and your ears will never end. &gt;&gt; He remains the same. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Aren't you happy this morning? Psalms 125 verse1 says they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion which cannot be removed but abide forever. &gt;&gt; You cannot be removed because God cannot be removed &gt;&gt; and if you are a part of him God cannot afford somebody to miss because then he's not God. So I want to say it in irreverence but God father Abraham said God needs you more than you need him. We don't take it in granted but this make us so humble to realize how great he is that he he he he he became in a me multi-member body &gt;&gt; and he needs you. &gt;&gt; Don't don't run from the plan come to the purpose of God. Brother Bram starts the sermon in he that is in you and he says uh paragraph 55 brother says in he that is in you 63. Now the text from that tonight I would like to use as a text and he says the title he that is in you and then he says something and on this I wish to build faith. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that is in you and on this I wish to build faith &gt;&gt; because all the other things will will fade out. But if you have faith, if your faith relies on he that is in you, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are saved because you have something in you &gt;&gt; that is a part of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have faith because because he that is in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You will be raptured not because you are good &gt;&gt; because many people are good. The neighbors are good &gt;&gt; but you will be raptured because of he that is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we didn't know this but the message of D came in our way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said you are not a child of child of Abraham. You are child of the living God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Build your faith on he that is in you. Build your salvation on he that is in you. Build your trust in God on he that is in you. And if Satan comes to your mind and say, "Oh, you will not make it." You can say, "This will not make it." But this will make it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because he's coming for his own. &gt;&gt; None of them will be lost. He's coming for his own. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this morning, we base our salvation on he that is in us. &gt;&gt; We based our eternal uh destination on he that is in us. &gt;&gt; And we know as glory to God, you cannot be lost because God cannot be lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Trust it. It's okay this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a little encouragement. And I know brother Chad, we enjoyed his ministry so much in Romania. But just a little encouragement under his under his ministry to say this message is nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; And the the thing is if he began this good work in you. &gt;&gt; He will finish it. &gt;&gt; Don't try to finish it. &gt;&gt; Don't try to I mean it's good to be honest. this this this man we have to keep it under laws and regulations because this otherwise can go in troubles but inside of you look to he that is in you &gt;&gt; because he that is in you he that began this work he will finish it &gt;&gt; Lord I thought that that that is a struggle to finish to make the rapture but the message of the hour came on my way and you told me it's a finished work &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's why blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 121, you cannot uh bow your your eyes. You have to lift your eyes. &gt;&gt; 121 verse1 says, I will lift my eyes. And when you lift your eyes, you will get help. &gt;&gt; So this message is not an earthly message, &gt;&gt; is a heavenly message. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why don't try to search the message down. Lift your eyes &gt;&gt; and the message the help &gt;&gt; is coming. The Bible says I will lift my eyes upon heels from sorry my reading is not so good but I will say it in my words from where my help comes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So your solution further the problem is the message of the hour &gt;&gt; is the revealed word of God. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; My verse two, my help come from the Lord for he had made heaven and the earth. This is in Israel. It's called the blessing of the the one who is on journey and the Israel is on is on a natural journey but the bride is on a spiritual journey. &gt;&gt; So the one who you can apply this on your spiritual journey. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You cannot it cannot be enough strong storm to in order to move you &gt;&gt; because the Bible says he will not suffer thy foot to be moved. And he he continues he that kept they will not slumber. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The thing is that I like it's all about him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we look to ourself and we can say, "Mama, that's me." &gt;&gt; Basically, in you is the perfect work of God. In you is a is an eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; The Bible says here, he will keep me. &gt;&gt; So now sometimes you think I shall not be moved. I shall not be moved. But that's a reality. You will not be moved. You are just like a tree standing on the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Behold, he that kept Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. &gt;&gt; Verse five, the Lord is thy keeper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is thy shade upon the right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot stop the evil. This is all around us. &gt;&gt; But you are preserved from it. &gt;&gt; The Lord shall preserve you from all your unbelief &gt;&gt; from all your struggles, from all your fails, &gt;&gt; the Lord is still preserving you. &gt;&gt; And I think we have a testimony and this is all if the Lord would not be on our side where we would be. &gt;&gt; But we want to make the Lord is our side. That's why we are here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And tomorrow we can say the same thing. We will be tomorrow there because the Lord is in our side &gt;&gt; and we will be till the rapture standing because the Lord is on your side. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. The Lord shall preserve thy soul. &gt;&gt; So he have some ingredients so powerful that this earth cannot destroy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He cannot be touched, cannot be removed. The light cannot go out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My God is stronger. My God is greater. &gt;&gt; He's greater than all your needs. He's greater than your your your your doubts. He's greater than your whatever you go through. He is in control. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He is in control. Tell you to your condition tonight, this morning, he is in control. So now as we spoke these things uh Paul says in Colossians uh Colossians 1:28 whom he preaching every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present &gt;&gt; the the message of Der is not changing seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not changing species. &gt;&gt; It's just presenting you. That's why sometimes people come in the message go in the message that but you you stay &gt;&gt; in our minds you have questions sure because it's this flesh &gt;&gt; but inside of you is there's no question about the message &gt;&gt; sometimes you know all these things we go through and we have some doubts always and and Satan comes to you and say you see you are doubting tell Satan this morning. I'm not doubting this message &gt;&gt; because he that is in me believes this message &gt;&gt; and my Bible says he cannot deny himself &gt;&gt; and I will stand faithful till the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because not I am faithful. He is faithful as in he's faithful in me &gt;&gt; and he he if he's in you this morning he's faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell your problems my my God is faithful &gt;&gt; and he's not somewhere he's right in you. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Another translation, the Amplified Bible says, "We proclaim him. We don't proclaim us." &gt;&gt; This message is proclaiming him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is in you. &gt;&gt; Glory. This says we proclaim him. warning. This for us is a warning. Sometimes when you see a warning, you take attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bible says this message is a warning. is is trying to attract your attention &gt;&gt; and instructing every this is the amplified Bible uh warning and instructing everyone in all wisdom that is with comprehensive insight into the word and purpose of God so that we may present every person not half &gt;&gt; not just a part complete in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the message came to present the finished work of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And in this we rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we know &gt;&gt; it's already done. &gt;&gt; The battle is over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have only some, as brother Bram said, some days have to pass. &gt;&gt; But you know your destination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your faith have a different source. &gt;&gt; The author and the finisher. And the guarantee of our faith is not expiring. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's have an eternal warranty, an eternal guarantee. It will never go out. It will always stand. &gt;&gt; So this will not make this will not change is is is not here that we may we will make you complete. We may change you in completion. We may add you. We may include you. This sounds like some churches &gt;&gt; but not the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We may try to convert you to be completed. We may try to convince you. This is not how it works. &gt;&gt; The message came to present the bride. &gt;&gt; Behold the the bride. &gt;&gt; The bride has has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Abraham says the highlight of my ministry &gt;&gt; is to clothe &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; in the word the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is it is a high thing to present. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Present uh to present is related to something that is finished. Sometimes in our lives many times uh we say my presentation is not finished in school or in in work my presentation is not finished. This this refers to an to to uh to to refers to a job that is not finished. &gt;&gt; When you present something you present a finished project. &gt;&gt; You you present a finished work. You present a finished plan. Usually presentation is related to something complete. &gt;&gt; We we we say I and we already say sometimes I cannot show you or I cannot present you because it's not yet done. But when it's done you are coming full of joy to your wife. I say darling let me present what I've did. And for sure she will say you need something to repair there or to just there. This happens but it's good that together the husband and wife make a good a perfect a complete work. Amen. So but some we say come I want to present you because I'm done. So when you when you a project or when a thing is done you you don't come say oh I finished it please you are happy because it's finished &gt;&gt; you are happy because it's completed &gt;&gt; and you are happy because you say I done it. &gt;&gt; My wife didn't believe me I can make it but I've done it. &gt;&gt; I want to prove her I made it. &gt;&gt; You see you are ready to present. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message, glory, are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to present &gt;&gt; a finished work of God. &gt;&gt; And God is full of joy when he's looking to you in this dark age. He knows it is finished. &gt;&gt; And and Bible says he is waiting. So the enemy will be under your feet. &gt;&gt; The message is not just relating something. is not just describing, it's presenting. &gt;&gt; David is it says in the Bible in Psalms, your word gave me life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I I don't if you want I can search it, but if you search, your word gave me life. &gt;&gt; Your word gave me life. And we can say we can we can recognize there is not not a quality of life like in this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you go out is a chaos. &gt;&gt; But I love this message. This gives a standard to our kids, &gt;&gt; to our families, to our relationships, to our everything. &gt;&gt; It's the highest form of life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for the kings from all the world, but they don't have this quality like you have it. &gt;&gt; Because it's a quality of supernatural life. &gt;&gt; It's a qual. It's the life of God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we feel a little bit humbled because we don't dress like them. We don't do things like them. But you should feel honored &gt;&gt; because none of them have the quality of life that you have, &gt;&gt; the quality of the family that you have. &gt;&gt; You don't when you leave home, you are not afraid. Oh, it will be a problem with my wife. You are you are in rest &gt;&gt; because you know the message is built on trust. &gt;&gt; The message is built on on on the work of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Paul says, I come to present the plan of God. The full purpose full means that doesn't need to be adjusted. Full need full means completed. &gt;&gt; It's already done. It is finished. Full means ready. Full means ready. That's why Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Sometimes we we we got a struggle and and say, "Oh, I have to be ready to receive the Holy Ghost. I have to be ready to be baptized. I have to make myself ready." But God needs you like he needed Mary because brother says in the church ages, the word will be in in the bride like what it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How he became he stepped in Mary &gt;&gt; by saying let it be according to thy word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Opening yourself completely, surrendering yourself to the word, it will change your life. &gt;&gt; Don't try you to make because then when you go in heaven, you will you will expect a diploma. &gt;&gt; I made it. But we understand from the message, not you made it. &gt;&gt; He made it in you. &gt;&gt; That's why we sing he deserve all the glory and the honor because it's his work. It's his per purpose. It's his plan. It's he from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; So now it makes sense. He's the author and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; There is no place for human intervention. There is no place to some to some unbelief because it's him from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; Oh, we ought to give him all the glory and honor. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But uh Paul says in Acts 20:27, "For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God." Another amplified Bible says, "For I did not shrink from declaring &gt;&gt; to you the whole purpose and the plan of God." &gt;&gt; We are living a declaration. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a declaration a declaration is referring only to a a special category of people. That's right. &gt;&gt; For example, the declaration of Abraham Lincoln regarding the slavery, the emancipation of proclamation issued in January 1st one 1863 was uh which declared the enslaved people to be free. The declaration was made only for the people that that were in slavery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For in people in Romania, this declaration, oh, so you would say, oh, how nice it is. But it didn't really meant to us nothing. &gt;&gt; But for the people that were there in condition and the declaration came to them, it meant everything &gt;&gt; because that made them free. And the declaration of the message &gt;&gt; is is is not speaking to everybody. But if it spoke to you, that means it is for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he declared you. You are not just the church. You are a bride. &gt;&gt; And the bride is his wife. And his wife, he will share the glory with him. He will be together. We will reign together with him. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. A declaration given by so and and we want to consider a declaration is given by an authority. &gt;&gt; This message is the highest authority. &gt;&gt; So if the message declared you free &gt;&gt; there is no higher authority to declare you different. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm happy. We are declared by the highest authority. It is finished. It's already done. the that the the the how is this song it's over it's already done amen blessed with the highest authority we have among us is the pillar of fire is the logos amen then is no one know how we are authority then brother says all hell is against this message but they cannot stop this message &gt;&gt; they can try it but they cannot stop it because if if God is with us we have the majority hallelujah Oh, what a special people. &gt;&gt; They're in the White House. No such people like people people like you because they are from a human authority. They are from a country authority. But you was declared by a supernatural authority but by a not a tiny authority by an eternal authority. You was declared free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is this this life that we are living. This is not your end. &gt;&gt; It's just the beginning. Brother Bram says you take with you the character. &gt;&gt; That's my let's let's don't fight against it. Let's say Lord let your character let your word be mold in the mangers of my heart. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Your journey start uh just starts in the in to eternity. But Abraham says, "We just made we just made eternity is like a is like a a circle. We just made a little going out &gt;&gt; and the going in." &gt;&gt; But the psalm says he is taking of your going out &gt;&gt; and of your going in. &gt;&gt; There is something to be afraid. Is there is something to be scared? You know we cannot serve God by fear because if their fear we there is no love &gt;&gt; because when you love a person if you if you if you fear that that person is doing something that's not anymore love &gt;&gt; that's that's that's just a a contract you I do this and I give you this you know but our relationship is God is not is not is not uh is not based on a contract it's based on family. It's based on source. It's based on eternity. And we don't we don't love him because he will he will throw us in in hell. We love him. But Abraham just think what statement even if he puts me in hell, I will still love him. &gt;&gt; This means hell cannot stop the love to God. &gt;&gt; There is no Paul says there is nothing can separate. &gt;&gt; There is nothing can separate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell tonight I cannot be separated from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I'm coming from him and I go back to him. &gt;&gt; I cannot be separated. I will go all the way. &gt;&gt; All the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name. All I will go all the way &gt;&gt; because it's him. He cannot deny himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He cannot deny me. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we we learn a declaration can be given by an authority. And to declare, Paul says, "I uh I I I" He says in in uh in Acts 20:27, uh he says, "I I didn't step back. I didn't I want I I come to declare the word purpose and the plan of God." So we have a declaration. You are free. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You are not saved in one day. you always was saved. &gt;&gt; And if this declaration sets you free from all denomination thinking from all whatever it is, it set you free because we have saw the rising of the sun &gt;&gt; and he that he he he was set free. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So I I imagine when these people what meant to them the declaration that declaration made them free that in January 1, 1863 at the rising of the sun you will be free and they will they they were looking to the problem like no power anymore because the declaration had a stronger power than the power that was slaving them. So whatever there is no enough power in hell to stop the little bride because you are coming from a higher authority. &gt;&gt; So when these people saw the uh were looking to the calendar that they knew is coming a day when my declaration in is coming in full power and nobody could stop that declaration because it was given by the president of the country and there was no uh powerful man. He was he signed it &gt;&gt; and our Lord Jesus signed at Calvary. He said it is done. It is finished and he is now resting on the full purpose and the full plan of God. He paid the price. He paid the price and the g the way back to the garden of Eden. It is open and now it is life. We are uniting together with the tree of life and he is coming in our in in our soul and there is a new invisible union taking place in you. Him and you are one. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. This is my story. This is your story. This is the bride story. The message is setting you free. That's why you cannot denominate this. You cannot put it in a box. You cannot put it because it's a it's a supernatural authority is coming. The angel said, "I'm coming from the presence of God." &gt;&gt; This Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody says, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; So, we see we see Paul is coming to de to declare and and brother Rams said, "I want he he came to declare us." Amen. He came to declare. I love that. He says, "I saw you there." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He He declared the finished work of God. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. And we are we know that by his grace, we will be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. The new birth is Christ is a revelation. God revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth. What are you going to do when you get all the group together? Where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions, the same things he did making the word manifest. And brother Abraham says, "Oh, if the church only knew its position, it will one day." &gt;&gt; Is declared. &gt;&gt; It will one day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm included in that. I will one day. &gt;&gt; And and then brother Brand says, "Then the rapture will come." &gt;&gt; No, he says, "Then the rapture will &gt;&gt; go." &gt;&gt; Amen. when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we want to take a little time here. Then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. Sometimes you know we have a they made some movies with the rapture with planes flying and when this happens but the problem is we have to know what is the rapture. Abraham says the rapture will go when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; God coming for his own. &gt;&gt; This is the rapture. &gt;&gt; And then you know that the rapture is already in you. &gt;&gt; You are the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rapture is in you. &gt;&gt; That's why don't try to act as I I read the quote in in the beginning. We have a supernatural message. You cannot act like a natural with having a natural message because the people that have a natural message, they will stay. &gt;&gt; But if you have a supernal image, you have to go. &gt;&gt; So you are you cannot stop. You can greet them, but you are on your way from revelation to revelation. &gt;&gt; You cannot stay in the same condition. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the church ages, &gt;&gt; that's all good. We need it. But we need something more. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need the message of the capstone. We the message of the of of of the uniting. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Because we are on the way to go. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So don't don't stop and say this is enough. &gt;&gt; Ask for more revelation. &gt;&gt; We need more of him. We need more of him. We need more of him. &gt;&gt; The rapture will go when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; My what a privileged people we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the the worst thing is to wait something and don't know what it is. &gt;&gt; Like my daughter, I spoke with her this morning. What you what you bring me that she was agitated just I tell what what you know but when you I tell her she have an expectation she know what to wait for. She she is in peace because this is belong it just coming closer and closer closer to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the glory transformation belongs to you. It is given to you and it's coming coming closer. &gt;&gt; Can you feel day by day we feel him closer? &gt;&gt; That's why brother Abraham says when you recognize the message of the hour being eagle food you have heard from your &gt;&gt; theophony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What blessed be the name of the Lord. What a special people. The rapture will go. &gt;&gt; The rapture is in me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the rapture cannot take place without you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you know what it is. It's that part of God that will be taken. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He cannot deny himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If uh the BI Bible says in he says God is not a man to forget. &gt;&gt; He cannot forget you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He always have you on his mind. &gt;&gt; That's why he is thinking at you all the time. &gt;&gt; He's thinking at you. You are precious in his sight. Oh glory. You know this message made us to to to to love him more. &gt;&gt; Say Lord thank you. Lord thank you for what you done for me. Lord thank you for the revelation of the hour. Thank you for the word. Otherwise we would be just some wanderers uh longing for an experience and then after next week we would like to have another experience and when you look to this person oh they maybe have another oh we want like this we want like that but once you know what it is the rapture you know it is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't look anymore around you look to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is in you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And all your expectation is not from an experience. All your expectation is from him &gt;&gt; because he's the author and the finisher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Expect from him. Expect from God. &gt;&gt; And he is coming your way. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He says in future home of of uh of heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride, you wasn't saved on one day. You you know if I would make I would come and make a testament you was not saved one day maybe you will see I agree or not agree but once we go through these steps then we say you know that's why we need revelation more and more of him because as he declares his word darkness go fade away and when is light coming light more and more light you can see and you can be presented the perfect plan of God blessed be the name of the lord &gt;&gt; brother Abraham says In victory day 630421 he says here he says now don't fail this to get this so we don't want to fail it when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found you have found favor with God and God believes that you will stand the test &gt;&gt; sometimes you think Oh, it would be nice in the time of Paul or when we would leave in other church age just to go and maybe eat by a lion or just very fast. But you know God believes for you in this age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God believes that you will stand the test. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; So you are coming in this message is not by mistake. Your coming in this message have a purpose and it's not a purpose of a man. It's the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Just just think God believes that you will stand the test. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And your coming and your outgoing is a test &gt;&gt; because it's not your word or my word in in in the situation in the game. It's God's word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God believes for his word. God believes that you will stand the test. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Now we understand 2 Timothy 2:13. If he we believe not yet he abide faithful because he cannot deny himself. &gt;&gt; You realizing that he is basically from the beginning to the end is his purpose is his it is him in us. Christ in us the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. What Abraham says in the rapture, "And if Christ is in you, he can't deny his own word." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So let's read it once again. If Christ is in you, he can't deny his own word. &gt;&gt; That means Christ believes in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. don't try you to believe because this is with mathematic physic it always try to put things &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; and sometimes one day say now I believe the message and tomorrow some newcomers oh now how it is &gt;&gt; you know this is human flesh &gt;&gt; but brother says if Christ is in you he can't deny his own word &gt;&gt; that's why your faith cannot Stop &gt;&gt; because Christ you cannot stop because light you cannot stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How darkness is how strong is the is the night when the sun in full authority comes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The night is running. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And one of these days this this darkness have to run around us &gt;&gt; because the sun &gt;&gt; he's coming in full in full power. He's coming in full authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. at all by the Bible says by one second we will be changed. &gt;&gt; The problem is the change is not starting from from outside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's starting from inside &gt;&gt; and you cannot if you see a woman that is waiting a baby, you cannot see from outside only after later. &gt;&gt; But she knows &gt;&gt; in her that she is carrying a seed. &gt;&gt; You you not always have a proof outside you &gt;&gt; but you have the proof inside. Is him that who does the work. It's him that believes this message. &gt;&gt; It's not an an external experience. It's an internal experience. &gt;&gt; God is uniting with his bride. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Father Abraham says in Jehovah Gyra what you scared about. He says if we are Abraham's seed it is a finished product. Those who he forneew he called. Those who he called he justified. Those who he has justified he has already glorified. What are you scared about? &gt;&gt; And I I will I will jump. But but he says here, this is just God's seed materializing. That's all. His words coming down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love this quote. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a word of a man. &gt;&gt; God's word coming down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He spoke it &gt;&gt; and he found place in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So human understand human &gt;&gt; uh sheep understand sheep &gt;&gt; God understand God &gt;&gt; God speak to a man they don't understand &gt;&gt; because it's not the same level &gt;&gt; God understand God &gt;&gt; attribute to attribute &gt;&gt; that's why Christ is speaking to you and you understand his words &gt;&gt; because he understand himself self &gt;&gt; because he cannot deny himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 55:11 says, "So shall my word be go forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have not a half salvation. You have a full salvation. &gt;&gt; But it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing where I I sent it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not here because you want it. You are here because you was sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if if he sent you, say, Lord, this morning, please strength me. &gt;&gt; Please help me to press on because all I want is to please your desire. &gt;&gt; It was your desire to be in this generation. Lord, help me go all the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he he loves when we we recognize that he is from the beginning to the end. He always tried to show Israel and tell Moses, Moses, why you are they are crying, not I have brought you out, not I will take you in. Don't try to make your own. Rely on me. Trust in me. God wanted God. Brother Bram says you give God a purpose. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we take the in one of the quotes brother says give the chance to God. Sometimes we don't give chance to God. say I want to make but this morning you say Lord many times I took your chance from my family from my life but this morning I want to give all that I have to you all my situations my conditions all that I have you are all that I need &gt;&gt; you are my only only refuge &gt;&gt; I was listening this morning future home of heavenly bridegroom the heavenly bride and brother Abraham said did you Ever think now bride that I what it will look like it is prepared and designed by the divine architect. &gt;&gt; I like this. &gt;&gt; I said that spoke to my heart. Divine architect. &gt;&gt; It's not a natural architect. &gt;&gt; It's a divine architect. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Aren't you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. As we we go closer to the end, we I just want to close with the Kingsman redeemer. And when a man loves a woman and marries her because she's just pretty, there will be an end to that. &gt;&gt; So sometimes, Amen. If you have reasons to trust God, lay the Bible says, lay all your reasonings down &gt;&gt; and look to him, &gt;&gt; the author and the finisher of your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham says, "But when a man finds a woman that he loves, he don't know why." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But loves her. You don't know why you follow this message. You don't know why what beliefs were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why why you believe it? You don't have a reason. I I believe because I think you there is something more to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't put I I will I will continue. He says he don't know why. In in other words, you don't have and I say it in in in respect, but you don't have a natural proof. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't have it. &gt;&gt; You just cannot explain it, but it's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she finds a man that she loves no matter how he looks like. He loves her. She loves him. That's an eternal mate in glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the response between your relationship with the message. You are an etern eternal made in glory with Christ to the world. &gt;&gt; That or nothing else can ever separate them. &gt;&gt; You because you cannot God separate God because then he is not God. &gt;&gt; Amen. that earth can never separate them because they are from eternity &gt;&gt; and they stepped out in a space of time and will return back to eternity. &gt;&gt; Eternity has dropped down in a body called time then goes back right back up into eternity. It cannot perish. &gt;&gt; Your relationship with God, it cannot perish. If the magicians can come up your family relationship with God, it cannot perish &gt;&gt; because it's not based on natural things. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not based on experience. It's based on the finished work of God. &gt;&gt; It's based on what God did. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God, he says in in in Luke, will he find faith? &gt;&gt; Right. He is find searching for faith. &gt;&gt; He's in other means in other words he's searching for himself. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's why faith is included in him. &gt;&gt; Faith it is a part of him. &gt;&gt; He's searching for his own. &gt;&gt; That's why you have rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; It is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you didn't know &gt;&gt; till the voice of the mama eagle cried out &gt;&gt; and told you you can fly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can you can &gt;&gt; you can uh overcome gravitation. &gt;&gt; Nobody thinks that we can do it but in you lace &gt;&gt; a special uh ability. One day you will step out &gt;&gt; and you can be overcome gravitation. &gt;&gt; Nothing can hold you down. &gt;&gt; Things that now looks hard on your life, this cannot hold down you. &gt;&gt; Because you have a a different author and a finisher &gt;&gt; of your faith. &gt;&gt; And this is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you find rest in him? &gt;&gt; Yes. Don't you find peace in him? &gt;&gt; Can you sing this song? He's all I need. Is that true? &gt;&gt; He's all we need. &gt;&gt; Many times we think we need a lot of things, but the response to eternity is him. &gt;&gt; The response to your troubles is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's all all I need. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when when you make him the king of your life when he you make him he's taking responsibility and say I will take everything I will take care my child just tell me that I am all I need and you gave him the highest possibility to take to take care of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't want you just surrender to him and say Lord from this day on you are all I need. &gt;&gt; You are all my answers. You are all my conditions is you. And in order to make the rapture is you. &gt;&gt; You are all I need. May the Lord bless you all. Shalom. Shalom. Brother Chad. He is all I need. He is all I need. Jesus is all I need. He all I need. He all I need. Jesus is all I need. Once more. He all I need. He all I need. Jesus is all I need. He's all I need. He all I need. Jesus is all I need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad he's all you need? &gt;&gt; Cuz he is everything. He's all in all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you encouraged? &gt;&gt; You encouraged to face the day. You encouraged to keep pressing on because it's all him &gt;&gt; and he cannot deny himself. I was so blessed by the word today. So thankful that God sent our brother our way. Amen. I needed a boost of encouragement. And I need to be reminded this really isn't about you and I. It's about him. &gt;&gt; Amen. from the beginning to the end. He's the author and he's the finisher, the completer, the perfector of our faith. Amen. I loved what the brother said. He said something early on that blessed me. Said God is not coming for volunteers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we feel like we did a good thing because, you know, we said, "I I'll do it." Listen, he didn't come to to He didn't come to all the women in Israel say, "Anybody volunteer to be a virgin bride?" He came to the one he already predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wasn't waiting for Esau and Jacob to see which one would volunteer. He said, "No, I've already chosen uh uh uh uh Jacob and not Esau." Amen. He wasn't coming for volunteers. He was coming to his own, the one he predestinated. And he wasn't asking you to volunteer one day, I'll volunteer to be bride. He already chose you to be bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember brother Abraham Myra said one time and he said, he goes, "I'm not a pastor. I'm not a preacher." Amen. Because I wanted to be. He goes, "I'm a victim of God's will. Hey, listen. I'm so happy to be part of God's bride that we're a victim of his will. He chose, Amen. before the foundation of the world. And I'm happy &gt;&gt; and thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what happens to volunteers in war, they start deserting &gt;&gt; when it gets too bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's good we didn't volunteer because when the battle gets hot and heavy, we might desert. But we didn't volunteer. He volunteered us. &gt;&gt; He chose us. And I'm so glad that he who started a work, he's going to finish the work. &gt;&gt; The other statement that he made that I wrote down quickly that blessed me so much and brother Benham said, "All hell is against this revelation." &gt;&gt; The revelation of who the bride really is. The revelation, the message came to peel back the amnesia so that we can see the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Said, "All hell is against this revelation." But then he said, "Look around. You're all believing it. That means you're already resisting all of hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the power of hell can't stop you from believing what all hell is against, but you believe it anyways. So the revelation inside each one of us that's a gift from God is more powerful than all the power of hell already. &gt;&gt; Amenise &gt;&gt; by what? By grace. You are saved by grace through faith. And that is not of yourself. That is a gift of God. I'm so thankful. And brother Brandham said, "And this revelation is the bride stand." She's not standing on her strength. She's not standing on her abilities. She's not standing on her works. She's just standing on this revelation of who he is and what he's done and who we are in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. All he's asked us to do is just trust him. God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's bow our heads and thank the Lord for the word today. Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful for for all that you spoke. And God, I'm so thankful that we don't have to look to the natural for proof or evidence, but God, this is a supernatural message. And you've given us the faith to believe. It's your faith planted in our souls because you cannot deny yourself. God, I'm so thankful, Lord, that we're not looking to anything temporary or weak like ourselves and our own flesh, our ability to choose, our willpower to stay to it. Lord, our mind, Lord, we're not depending on any of that because that's all weak. That's all natural. But Lord, what we're depending on is an eternal guarantee from an author, a manufacturer that has a reputation that your product will never fail. Lord, your product of predestination, of grace, of faith, your plan, Lord, from before the foundation of the world, it'll never fail. It has an eternal guarantee. And so now we can not have we can we can rest and let anxiety just go away because Lord, it'll never fail. Your plan will never fail. Your purpose will never fail. But you've given us a guarantee. And we have faith in you, the author and the finisher of our faith. You started it, you'll finish it. You didn't ask us to start it. You didn't ask us to stay stay in it. You didn't ask us to finish it. You just asked us to believe. And it's even you in us believing. God, help us to rest in what you've done. Help us to rejoice in what you've done. Help us to walk with a smile on our face every day. For we know within us the secret of your predestinated plan and the power of the supernatural. And God, may you grant us greater revelation day by day. That the natural eyesight would give way to the spiritual eyesight. That by revelation, by the gift of revelation, we will see more clearly every day this plan that you've unveiled, that you've unfolded. Lord, may it be Isab in our eyes. So our vision can become 2020 crystal clear that we can see what has always been and what always will be. And God, may there we rest and rejoice and abide. We love you. We thank you for all you've done. We pray you bless our brother Ruben and his home church, his family, and everyone. Lord, that you'd watch over him in the rest of his travels and as he goes home and this afternoon as he ministers to the youth. Pray that you use him once again. and and may you replenish his strength and may you bless him for you've used him to bless us. And while we thank you for this morning and for this time, may we walk out of here encouraged and strengthened by the revelation of the word. And may we be more yielded than we've ever been before and that more surrendered than we've ever been before that you might do the work that you've left for this day that you might do it in us. We love you. We thank you, God, and ask for your blessings over all that was said. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. Is all I need. He all I need. Jesus is all I need. He is all I need. He all I need. Jesus is all I need. Oh, I worship him. I worship him in spirit and in truth. I worship him. I worship him in spirit and in truth.
