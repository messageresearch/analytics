[13:17] me let your
[13:21] spirit move through me Lord speak to me
[13:31] let's bow our heads
[13:33] together precious Lord Jesus we're truly
[13:37] grateful once again for this
[13:40] opportunity that you've given us to
[13:42] gather together
[13:45] Lord father
[13:47] it's so
[13:49] easy to get lost in the shuffle and get
[13:52] lost in the busyness and the cares of
[13:56] Life Lord and
[13:59] things can just become a tradition to us
[14:02] father but may we come here tonight
[14:07] and just refocus
[14:11] ourself and understand that we're not
[14:14] here just out of tradition we're not
[14:17] here for a social Gathering we're not
[14:20] here just for church
[14:22] Lord but you
[14:24] could strip this building away from us
[14:28] you could strip these microphones away
[14:32] from us you could strip everything from
[14:35] around us Lord
[14:37] and we would still be your church here
[14:40] this evening Lord and our assembling and
[14:43] our gathering together is for two
[14:46] purposes Lord
[14:48] to give you the praise that you are so
[14:52] worthy to receive collectively
[14:56] Lord and your Worthy that and we want to
[15:00] fulfill our role in that Lord but also
[15:04] secondly for you to come and to speak to
[15:07] us and to reveal yourself to us and to
[15:11] reveal ourselves to ourselves Lord that
[15:14] we would know what we need to do
[15:16] differently and what we would need to
[15:18] change and how we would could be molded
[15:21] into your character
[15:24] father so may we approach this service
[15:28] tonight
[15:29] with that in mind Lord to worship you
[15:34] both in spirit and in truth not just to
[15:37] sing songs of praise and then go
[15:41] out unchanged father but to truly
[15:45] worship you to prostrate oursel to lay
[15:49] oursel before you the revealed word and
[15:53] submit oursel to that we would just ask
[15:57] that you would come
[15:59] Lord we know this is your
[16:02] method even though we're not worthy or
[16:06] even
[16:07] capable but that you would come and stir
[16:10] up a gift within
[16:13] and take the bread of life Lord and feed
[16:16] your hungry children just pray that you
[16:19] would give us ears to hear Lord and a
[16:22] heart to perceive as we would yield
[16:25] ourselves completely to you this evening
[16:28] the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[16:32] amen God bless you this evening if you
[16:34] have your Bibles
[16:36] we'll turn to the book of Philippians
[16:39] chapter
[16:43] 2 hopefully this is starting
[16:46] to become a little bit of a familiar
[16:48] scripture to
[16:51] you Philippians chapter 2 beginning in
[16:54] verse three and I would just like to
[16:57] continue this thought on the pride of
[16:59] life this evening with
[17:02] a uh subtitle of a faithful servant so
[17:07] we're still very much focused on the
[17:10] pride of life but we want
[17:13] to look at a faithful servant in
[17:17] comparison to
[17:18] that Philippians chapter 2 beginning in
[17:21] verse
[17:22] three says let nothing be done through
[17:25] Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness
[17:29] of mine Let each esteem other better
[17:31] than
[17:32] themselves look not every man on his own
[17:35] things but every man also on the things
[17:37] of others and let this mind be in you
[17:40] which was also in Christ Jesus who being
[17:43] in the form of God thought it not
[17:45] robbery to be equal with God but made
[17:49] himself of no
[17:50] reputation and took upon him the form of
[17:53] a servant and was made in the likeness
[17:56] of
[17:56] men and being found in in fashion as a
[17:59] man he humbled himself and became
[18:02] obedient unto death even the death of
[18:04] the Cross God bless you as you would
[18:07] have your seats this evening we're just
[18:09] going to read a couple things here by
[18:11] way of review but I don't intend to T
[18:14] too long with
[18:15] that in the Book
[18:19] of
[18:20] Ezekiel 2:
[18:23] 2 we see an example of the contrast and
[18:28] the direct opposite anointing that was
[18:30] on Jesus Christ it says son of man say
[18:34] unto the prince of Tyrus thus sayith the
[18:36] Lord God because thine heart is lifted
[18:39] up and thou Hast said I am a God I sit
[18:43] in the seat of God in the midst of the
[18:45] Seas yet thou art a man and not God
[18:49] though thou Hast set thine heart as the
[18:51] heart of God and then verse 17 thine
[18:55] heart was lifted up because of thy
[18:58] Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by
[19:01] reason of thy brightness and I will cast
[19:04] thee to the ground I will lay thee
[19:07] before kings that they may behold thee
[19:10] so we can see the characteristics that
[19:14] Christ
[19:15] demonstrated who being in the form of
[19:17] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[19:20] with God but that Revelation caused him
[19:22] to Humble himself to take upon himself
[19:25] and make up make himself of no
[19:29] reputation and then we see uh we know
[19:32] this is spiritually applying to Satan
[19:35] here Lucifer and we see that him being
[19:41] nobody made himself somebody so he did
[19:44] exactly opposite of what the Son of God
[19:47] did the Son of God was somebody and
[19:50] we've said before he was literally the
[19:52] only person who could come with a
[19:55] reputation and would be honest about it
[19:57] and would not be puffing himself up it
[20:00] was what it was he was the son of go God
[20:04] and he was worthy of any reputation that
[20:07] would be given him as far as a high in a
[20:11] high esteem but here we have Lucifer who
[20:14] is a created being and should be and
[20:17] should be subject to the characteristics
[20:20] of the god that created him but he
[20:24] deviated from that and somehow in the
[20:26] brightness and in his own Beauty
[20:30] defaulted from the brightness of the
[20:33] wisdom that he had so this Revelation
[20:36] that he caught of himself somehow made
[20:40] him miss the entire picture of who he
[20:42] actually was and now as a result of this
[20:46] Revelation he starts speaking things and
[20:49] these things although he believed them
[20:52] and was stating them as fact these
[20:54] things were actually
[20:56] lies and the scripture says
[21:01] he says that you you have said thou Hast
[21:04] said I am a God but he wasn't right but
[21:08] he was saying that right it says I sit
[21:12] in the seat of God in the midst of the
[21:14] Seas says but yet thou art a man you are
[21:17] a created being amen great not a god
[21:21] even though he would declare that so we
[21:23] can see the contrast between the two
[21:26] characteristics and remember in that
[21:27] script second scripture that we read
[21:29] there the issue was in thine
[21:35] heart in thine heart you have said this
[21:39] so even if he would have never acted
[21:42] upon this even if he would have never
[21:43] manifested this
[21:46] externally the problem was still in his
[21:49] heart he had taken a wrong opinion he
[21:51] had caught a wrong Revelation
[21:54] right Proverbs 6:16 these six these six
[21:59] things doeth the Lord hate yay seven are
[22:02] an Abomination unto him number one a
[22:06] proud
[22:07] look number two a lying tongue and hands
[22:11] that shed innocent blood and heart that
[22:13] deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that
[22:16] be Swift and running to Mischief a false
[22:18] witness that speaketh lies and he that
[22:21] Seth Discord among Brethren I'd venture
[22:25] to say that Lucifer Lucifer fulfilled
[22:27] all of those
[22:29] even in his heart he fulfilled all of
[22:32] those 1 John 2:15 says love not the
[22:35] world neither the things that are in the
[22:37] world if any man love the world the love
[22:39] of the father is not in him for all that
[22:42] is in the world the lust of the flesh
[22:45] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[22:47] life is not of the father but is of the
[22:51] world then I'm going to read this quote
[22:54] to you we've read it almost every time
[22:57] but just to
[22:59] refresh you of where this inspiration is
[23:01] stemming from 1953 go tell my disciples
[23:05] brother brandham said speaking of Mary
[23:07] so she had Seven Devils cast out of her
[23:11] pride and envy and she thought she was
[23:14] so pretty and there was no one like her
[23:18] it's really hard for me not to preach on
[23:20] this every service and just take the
[23:22] entire service on this one quote because
[23:25] there's so many facets that you can go
[23:27] into and there is
[23:29] so many uh it's just like a cobweb when
[23:32] you start dealing into this pride of
[23:34] life everywhere that it goes and cobwebs
[23:37] and rabbit trails and ant hills and
[23:40] everything else that you can throw in
[23:41] there there it just encompasses so much
[23:44] when a when a prophet now comes and
[23:47] picks up something out of the scriptures
[23:49] and sets that new standard before us so
[23:52] now we don't have to wonder well what
[23:54] was the Devils that was cast out of her
[23:56] and how did those manifest how did those
[23:58] uh represent themselves now a prophet
[24:01] can come and pick up this scripture and
[24:03] this example and tell us that one of
[24:05] these Devils was pride and that Pride
[24:08] was representing itself and manifesting
[24:11] itself simply by her
[24:14] thinking that she was so pretty and
[24:17] there was nobody like her and as I've
[24:20] said multiple times before once the
[24:23] standard is clear not what we think
[24:27] pride is yeah not what we think that we
[24:30] manifest Pride as but now when a prophet
[24:33] comes and presents the real standard now
[24:37] we can appropriately compare Our Lives
[24:39] to that now we can appropriately compare
[24:41] our character to that now we can
[24:43] appropriately compare our thought
[24:45] processes and what is in our heart to
[24:48] that because we can say that we're not
[24:51] prideful but are you not prideful to
[24:53] what your own standard or maybe another
[24:57] standard that somebody has set to you
[24:59] you're not prideful compared to this
[25:02] person yeah but we're always going to
[25:05] come up short unless we have the real
[25:07] standard the appropriate standard given
[25:10] by one who is an authority to give the
[25:12] standard amen and I thank God that we've
[25:15] had an authority to give us a standard
[25:18] yes and you know what that may be a hard
[25:21] statement but I find in myself that I
[25:24] don't have a problem with a new standard
[25:27] I find myself even when I read this and
[25:29] I told you I've told you before it you
[25:31] know really wrecked my life which was a
[25:33] good thing but even as hard as this was
[25:38] and as difficult as it was coming and
[25:42] recognizing how short that I came to
[25:45] this new
[25:47] standard I was still at the end of the
[25:49] day
[25:50] grateful that now I have the appropriate
[25:53] standard now I can at least start moving
[25:56] forward because in the past my eyes were
[25:59] just blind to it and I'm just walking
[26:01] around blind to it and and we know the
[26:03] prophet gave that example that if you
[26:05] have a man who just wants to tuck
[26:07] himself in the basement and and declare
[26:10] there's no sun there's no like there's
[26:12] not much you can do to help that
[26:13] individual if if he's wanting to be
[26:15] blind yeah but if you find an individual
[26:18] that's blind and he's walking out
[26:20] stumbling and he he's half-dressed you
[26:22] know if you can get him to recognize
[26:24] there's a problem then you can help that
[26:27] individual and this is what God has done
[26:30] for us Saints we came to this Earth with
[26:33] spiritual Amnesia we came to this Earth
[26:36] with complexes in DNA that we never
[26:40] really ask for but the problem with that
[26:43] is when it's in your DNA and it's made
[26:46] into you the the scripture says that
[26:48] every man in his own heart says that
[26:50] he's fine says that he's right every man
[26:52] in his own eyes thinks that he's right
[26:54] we can't recognize that now we can
[26:57] recognize it pretty easily and everybody
[26:59] else but because we're wired the way
[27:03] we're wired we just it's kind of like a
[27:08] black black Zone there we can't properly
[27:10] identify what we need to properly
[27:12] identify so the point that I'm making is
[27:15] we have to have this because even if we
[27:19] can discern nine things out of 10
[27:21] there's going to be number 10 that you
[27:23] miss you're not going to be able to
[27:26] properly discern yourself even the
[27:29] scripture says that the heart is
[27:30] exceeding Wicked who can discern it who
[27:33] can know it so we have to have an
[27:37] authority come on the scene and declare
[27:39] these standards to us so that we can
[27:41] even get off first base so we then so
[27:44] that we can start down the right path
[27:47] because if not we're just we're a
[27:49] hopeless cause that's right so I'm
[27:51] grateful for that I'm thankful for
[27:54] that so when we have this standard
[27:57] brought
[27:58] it may be a tough standard and no doubt
[28:00] this is not the last tough standard
[28:02] that's going to be clarified to us I'm
[28:05] sure there's further clarification
[28:08] coming in the message that we're going
[28:10] to return to the woe is me
[28:12] stage but that's
[28:14] okay that's okay there's there's nothing
[28:17] wrong with coming to the wo is me stage
[28:19] there's a point behind that there's a
[28:21] process behind that but what I'm most
[28:23] grateful for is now that I've got eyes
[28:25] to see
[28:28] so I don't have a problem with a
[28:30] standard I don't have a problem lining
[28:32] up to that I don't have any resistance
[28:34] into me well maybe that's not exactly
[28:37] how it
[28:38] manifested no when I read that I said
[28:40] that's exactly the truth and I'm in a
[28:44] really bad position because I've got a
[28:47] lot of shaping up to do but that doesn't
[28:49] change the fact that this is the truth
[28:52] this is the standard this is the way
[28:54] that it is this Rings true to me and I
[28:56] want to line up to that
[28:59] he says but Jesus spoke and said be thou
[29:01] clean and all that left her she became a
[29:04] new person she wasn't so pretty anymore
[29:07] in her own sight and this is the key
[29:10] remember the the outward appearance no
[29:14] doubt did not change I'm sure maybe her
[29:17] dress changed and so forth but as I said
[29:20] I'm sure her facial features did not
[29:22] just mag magically you know become ugly
[29:28] in her own
[29:30] sight she wasn't so pretty anymore but
[29:34] she wrapped herself in the robe of
[29:35] meekness and gentleness and followed the
[29:39] master okay there's your review let's
[29:41] get going 2 Samuel chapter
[29:45] 3 2 Samuel chapter 3 you might want to
[29:48] keep your Bibles handy because we're
[29:51] going to be reading quite a bit of
[29:53] scripture um we're probably going to
[29:57] skip through through some of this just
[29:59] for the sake of time but we'll give you
[30:01] enough to know where we're reading at
[30:03] and where we're coming from I'm also
[30:05] going to apologize in advance we're in
[30:08] the Old Testament and there are names
[30:10] here that I don't have a clue how to say
[30:12] so I'm not going to apologize every time
[30:14] that I mess one up just understand that
[30:16] I'm probably going to mess up all of
[30:18] them and you can find it in the Bible
[30:20] yourself and you can figure out how to
[30:22] pronounce it but I'm probably going to
[30:24] just sound it out and you'll get the
[30:26] point
[30:28] and just forgive me for my ignorance but
[30:32] um it's just the way that it
[30:35] is verse 6 and it came to
[30:38] pass there was war between the house of
[30:41] Saul and the House of David so this is
[30:45] after Saul has died just to give you a
[30:48] little understanding where we're at Saul
[30:50] has died but the kingdom has not been
[30:52] reconciled to David yet came to pass
[30:55] there was war and that between Saul and
[30:57] the House of David and that Abner made
[31:01] himself strong for the house of Saul so
[31:04] this is captain of the host in Saul's
[31:07] former
[31:09] Kingdom and Saul had a concubine whose
[31:13] name was rea
[31:15] rispa the daughter of aah and ishes said
[31:20] to Abner wherefore hast thou gone in to
[31:24] my father's
[31:26] concubine then was Abner very wroth for
[31:29] the words of ishbosheth so ishbosheth is
[31:33] Saul's son Abner's captain of the host
[31:37] Abner is kind of keeping everything
[31:39] together here since Saul has passed away
[31:42] and now one of Saul's Sons comes to
[31:44] Abner and says why have you went into my
[31:48] father's
[31:49] concubine then was Abner very Roth for
[31:52] the words of ishbosheth and said am I a
[31:56] dog's head which against Judah do show
[31:59] kindness this day unto the house of Saul
[32:01] thy father to his Brethren and to his
[32:04] friends and have not derived thee into
[32:07] the hand of David that thou charges me
[32:10] today with a fault concerning this woman
[32:13] in 2024 terms how dare
[32:19] you he says so do God to Abner and more
[32:24] also except as the Lord hath sworn to
[32:27] David even so do I to him to translate
[32:33] the Kingdom from the house of Saul and
[32:35] to set up the Throne of David over
[32:37] Israel and over Judah from Dan even to
[32:40] BBA and he could not answer abnar a word
[32:44] again because he feared him so this
[32:47] gentleman comes accuses Abner Abner of
[32:50] something that he has not done Abner
[32:52] says how dare you I'm the one that's
[32:55] holding everything together here and
[32:57] because you've done this you're done I
[32:59] am now going to take the entire Kingdom
[33:01] and as God has told David and promised
[33:04] to David I going to make that happen now
[33:07] I am going to take the entire Kingdom
[33:09] and give it to David because you could
[33:10] not keep your mouth shut concerning me
[33:12] in these false false
[33:15] accusations and this gentleman done the
[33:17] only wise thing that he could do he shut
[33:19] his mouth because now he realizes he's
[33:22] went too far and his kingdom is
[33:26] done and Abner sent Messengers to David
[33:30] on his behalf saying who is the land
[33:33] saying also make thy league with me and
[33:37] behold my hand shall be with thee to
[33:39] bring about all Israel unto thee so he
[33:42] sends Messengers to David says the rest
[33:46] of Israel is in my hand make your league
[33:48] with me and I will simply put the
[33:51] kingdom in your control skipping to
[33:54] verse 17 and Abner had communication
[33:57] with the elders of Israel saying ye
[33:59] sought for David in times past to be
[34:01] king over you now then do it for the
[34:03] Lord hath spoken of David saying by the
[34:06] hand of my servant David I will save my
[34:08] People Israel out of the hand of the
[34:10] Philistines and out of the hand of all
[34:12] their enemies and Abner also spoke in
[34:15] the years of Benjamin and Abner went
[34:17] also to speak in the ears of David and
[34:19] Hebron all that seemed good to Israel
[34:22] and that seemed good to the whole house
[34:24] of Benjamin so Abner came to David David
[34:28] to Hein and 20 men with him and David
[34:31] made Abner and the men that were with
[34:33] him a feast and Abner said unto David I
[34:36] will arise and go and I will gather all
[34:38] Israel unto my Lord the king that they
[34:41] may make a league with thee and that
[34:42] thou mayest Reign Over All That thy
[34:45] heart desireth and Abner and David sent
[34:48] abnar away and he went in peace and
[34:51] behold the Servants of David and joab
[34:54] came from pursu pursuing a troop and
[34:56] brought in a great spoil with them but
[34:59] Abner was not with David and heon for he
[35:03] had sent him away and he was gone in
[35:06] peace so just a little recap Abner comes
[35:10] presents his proposition to David David
[35:12] makes him a feast okay this is the way
[35:14] things are you recognize the promise
[35:16] that's over me go and do what you're
[35:18] going to do he sends them back towards
[35:21] Israel to rally the troops and bring
[35:23] things under his
[35:24] Dominion joab showed up on the scene now
[35:28] joab was out fighting a battle and he
[35:30] shows up and all the host that was with
[35:34] him were come and they told joab now
[35:36] remember joab is the captain of the host
[35:39] for David's Army for
[35:42] Judah and they told
[35:44] him Abner the son of Nur came to the
[35:47] king and he has sent him away and he is
[35:51] gone in
[35:52] peace then joab came came to the king
[35:55] and said what hast thou done behold
[35:59] Abner came unto thee why is it that thou
[36:02] Hast sent him away and he is quite gone
[36:06] thou knowest Abner the son of Nur that
[36:08] he came to deceive thee and to Know Thy
[36:12] going out and thy coming in and to know
[36:15] all that thou doest now joab has gone
[36:18] he's been fighting a battle he's missed
[36:20] the entire chain of events but yet he
[36:23] shows up with prophetic insight and
[36:27] absolute amazing discernment of what's
[36:30] going
[36:31] on but he's entirely wrong
[36:36] yeah he's been out doing what he was
[36:38] supposed to be doing for David but now
[36:41] he shows up and there's somebody who
[36:44] said that they're going to do
[36:47] something uh incredible and one man not
[36:51] joab but one man is going to deliver the
[36:55] entire Kingdom in today David's hand not
[36:59] joab another man and joab
[37:04] immediately immediately has such insight
[37:08] to the purpose and the reasonings that
[37:12] this man would be here doing this and he
[37:16] declares he does not ask a question this
[37:18] is not a
[37:20] question he shows up on the scene and
[37:22] immediately knows the answer this man
[37:25] was here to deceive you and he declares
[37:27] it as fact yeah when in fact it's a lie
[37:33] that's right true
[37:36] right he wasn't there for the meeting he
[37:39] wasn't there when ishbosheth accused
[37:42] Abner of laying with Saul's concubine
[37:44] and Abner said okay I'll show you yeah
[37:48] he wasn't there for any of
[37:50] this but yet how does he have this
[37:55] discernment of the int itions of this
[38:03] man and when joab was come out from
[38:05] David he sent Messengers after Abner
[38:08] which brought him again from The Well of
[38:10] SRA but David knew it not and when Abner
[38:15] was returned to Hein joab took him aside
[38:18] in the gate to speak with him quietly
[38:20] and smote him there under the fifth rib
[38:22] that he died for the blood of AEL his
[38:26] brother so Abner we won't get into this
[38:29] right now but Abner had killed joab's
[38:32] brother back in the day in a fight and
[38:35] obviously he had never gotten over that
[38:37] even though David had tried to encourage
[38:39] him
[38:40] to and afterwards when David heard it he
[38:44] said I and my kingdom are Guiltless
[38:48] before the Lord forever from the blood
[38:51] of Abner the son of Nur let it rest on
[38:54] the head of joab and on all his father's
[38:57] house and let there not fail from the
[38:59] house of joab one that hath an issue or
[39:03] that is a leper or that leanth on a
[39:05] staff or that falleth on the sword or
[39:07] that lath
[39:12] bread that is not a good
[39:16] list but that is the
[39:20] list that follows the
[39:23] spirit of presuming
[39:28] remember what we are taught presuming is
[39:31] venturing without
[39:34] Authority joab has showed up and because
[39:38] joab doesn't want somebody else to do
[39:40] what he couldn't get done and he doesn't
[39:43] want somebody else to get the credit for
[39:45] doing something amazing and delivering
[39:48] the entire Kingdom into David's hand
[39:50] that was the goal was it not why was
[39:52] joab out fighting it was for David but
[39:56] now the somebody that shows up who can
[39:58] do something joab
[40:00] can't and joab has false discernment and
[40:04] joab
[40:05] presumes and he wants this to be true it
[40:08] doesn't matter at this point whether
[40:10] it's true or not this is what joab wants
[40:12] to be
[40:13] true so he sins and he fetches this guy
[40:17] back and he pulls him aside like he
[40:20] would talk to him as a brother and then
[40:22] he knifes him under the fifth
[40:25] rib and he kills
[40:28] against the wishes of David David did
[40:31] not order him to do this David did not
[40:33] suggest that he do
[40:35] this this is all joab venturing without
[40:40] Authority acting upon that see the this
[40:44] is the real danger of false discernment
[40:47] Saints it's a real danger to make
[40:50] yourself more spiritual than what you
[40:52] are it does not come without
[40:55] consequences yeah yeah
[41:00] amen he does
[41:02] this and it's not just bad enough that
[41:06] now that penalty and that blood is
[41:09] resting on
[41:12] him but now what he decided to do for
[41:16] his own sake and for his own position
[41:21] what he decided to do just for him now
[41:25] has negative consequences on everybody
[41:28] in his family from then
[41:31] on Let It rest on the house of joab and
[41:34] all his father's house and let there not
[41:36] fell from the house of job one that hath
[41:39] an issue or that is a leper or that lean
[41:43] crippled leanth on a staff or that
[41:45] falleth on the sword or that lacketh
[41:49] bread brother Brandon said when lot went
[41:52] down to Sodom he did not consider the
[41:56] effects that that would have on on his
[42:04] children this is terrifying for a
[42:14] father I was okay until I had
[42:17] children and then I realized that I've
[42:19] got kids that I'm eternally responsible
[42:22] for right and now I can't just make a
[42:25] mistake and it be okay and sweep it
[42:27] under the rug I can't deviate here and
[42:32] it' be okay and you just sweep it under
[42:33] the
[42:34] rug I can't make excuses anymore for not
[42:38] lining up to the word of God because it
[42:41] used to be maybe I would just know about
[42:43] or maybe my wife would just know about
[42:44] it but now I've got to fool four little
[42:47] children about it and now I'm preaching
[42:49] to my children that they have to give
[42:51] preeminence to the word and that they
[42:53] have to be yielded to the spirit of God
[42:55] but yet they can see in my life where
[42:57] I'm
[43:03] not lot did not
[43:07] consider the effects it would have on
[43:09] his children when he for himself chose
[43:13] Sodom right okay lot is you Sodom is
[43:18] compromised against the word just in
[43:20] case you're having a hard time following
[43:21] the
[43:23] type when we I said you lot is us
[43:27] when
[43:29] we consider what we want and what is
[43:34] good and best for
[43:36] us irregardless of what the word of God
[43:40] says yeah you are not just affecting
[43:51] yourself you're going to affect your
[43:54] children you're going to affect the
[43:56] local body
[43:58] you're going to affect the coworker you
[44:00] might have had a chance to witness to at
[44:02] work the list goes on and on and on for
[44:10] Generations this is the
[44:14] danger of
[44:16] presuming and just taking what we want
[44:21] doing what we think is
[44:23] best and the King said unto his servants
[44:27] know this is verse 38 know ye not that
[44:30] there is a prince and a great man Fallen
[44:33] This Day in Israel he's referring back
[44:34] to Abner who joab just
[44:38] killed and I am this day weak though
[44:41] anointed king and these men the son of
[44:46] the sons of zarua be too hard for
[44:50] me the Lord shall reward the doer of
[44:54] evil according to his wickedness so now
[44:57] here's King David who was a warrior who
[45:00] had fought Lord only knows how many
[45:02] battles at this point had slain however
[45:04] many people but now David comes and says
[45:07] these sons joab and his
[45:10] brother they're too hard for even
[45:14] me I can't sanction this this is too
[45:19] much for me and he's he's telling his
[45:21] people don't you understand what Abner
[45:23] was trying to do don't you understand
[45:26] that is a great man Abner was was acting
[45:29] in the place of a great man to do
[45:31] something great and he is dead don't you
[45:34] all understand that this is not a time
[45:35] to be
[45:37] happy skipping to 2 Samuel
[45:41] 19 second Samuel
[45:44] 19 verse
[45:46] 9 and all the people were at Strife
[45:49] throughout all the tribes of Israel
[45:51] saying the king saved us out of the hand
[45:53] of our enemies and he delivered us out
[45:55] of the hand of the Philistines
[45:57] and now he is fled out of the land for
[45:59] absum and absum whom we anointed over us
[46:03] is dead in battle now therefore why
[46:07] speak ye not a word of bringing the king
[46:09] back so this is again after the
[46:12] Insurrection of Absalon David was
[46:15] Outcast then Absalon was killed in
[46:18] battle and all Israel is saying why have
[46:21] we not considered bringing King David
[46:23] back why are we so LAX in this verse 11
[46:27] and King David sent to zadok and to abur
[46:32] the priest saying Speak unto the Elders
[46:34] of Judah saying why are ye the last to
[46:37] bring the king back to his house seeing
[46:40] the speech of all Israel is come to the
[46:43] king even to his house ye are my
[46:45] brethren ye are my bones and my flesh
[46:48] wherefore then are ye the last to bring
[46:50] back the king and say ye to
[46:54] amasa Art Thou not of my bone and of My
[46:58] Flesh God do so to me and more also if
[47:02] thou be not captain of the of the host
[47:05] before me continually in the room of
[47:08] joab meaning instead of joab and he
[47:11] bowed the heart of all the men of Judah
[47:14] even as the heart of one man so that
[47:17] they sent this word unto the king return
[47:20] thou and all thy servants so amasa was I
[47:25] don't know if he was maybe Deputy Chief
[47:28] of Staff to Abner but he was directly
[47:35] with or beside Abner Abner got taken off
[47:38] the scene by joab there's another War
[47:41] there's another Insurrection and now
[47:44] David is recognizing they're without a
[47:45] king and he's questioning them what's
[47:48] going on why can we not reconcile why
[47:50] has this not been brought forth and now
[47:52] he speaks to the new captain of the host
[47:55] amasa and he tells
[47:58] him basically if you'll forgive me for
[48:00] inserting it basically do what Abner had
[48:03] agreed to do and I will make you captain
[48:05] of the host and that will never cease
[48:07] you will be captain of the host
[48:09] continually before
[48:12] me
[48:13] Abner it says AB uh not Abner amasa
[48:18] bowed the heart of all the men of Judah
[48:21] even as the heart of one man so that
[48:23] they sent this word unto the king return
[48:26] and all thy servants so this one man was
[48:29] able to do exactly what uh Abner said
[48:32] that he was going to do and he rallies
[48:34] the kingdom and positionally places them
[48:38] under
[48:41] David short time goes
[48:45] p 2 Samuel
[48:48] 20:1 and there happened to be there a
[48:50] man of bile as this is all going on and
[48:53] there happened to be there a man of bile
[48:55] whose name was she
[48:57] the son of betra a benjamite and he blew
[49:02] a trumpet and said we have no part in
[49:04] David neither have we inheritance in the
[49:07] son of Jesse every man to his tents all
[49:10] Israel skipping to verse
[49:12] four then said the king to amasa so
[49:16] amasa is now captain of the host and
[49:18] there's an Insurrection going
[49:22] on David says to amasa assemble me the
[49:25] men of Judah within 3 days and be thou
[49:27] here present so amasa went to assemble
[49:30] the men of Judah but he carried longer
[49:32] than the set time which had been
[49:34] appointed him and David said
[49:36] to
[49:38] abash now shall Sheba the son of VRA do
[49:44] us more harm than did Absalom take thou
[49:48] thy Lord's servants and pursue after him
[49:51] lest he get him fenced cities and Escape
[49:54] Us in other words Sheba is causing this
[49:58] Insurrection amas is taking too long to
[50:00] get it to get it done go take care of
[50:04] this for
[50:05] me and there went out after him joab's
[50:09] men and the I'm not going to try to
[50:13] pronounce that another group of people
[50:14] and another group of people and the
[50:16] Mighty Men and they went out of
[50:18] Jerusalem to pursue after
[50:20] Sheba verse 8 when they were at the
[50:23] great Stone which is in gibian a Masa
[50:27] went before them and joab's garment that
[50:30] he had put on was girded unto him so not
[50:34] only did he get joab's position he got
[50:37] joab's
[50:41] clothing and upon it a girdle with a
[50:44] sword fastened upon his loins and the
[50:46] sheath thereof and as he went forth it
[50:49] fell out and joab had now caught up to
[50:53] amasa and joab said to amasa art thou in
[50:57] health my brother and joab took amasa by
[51:00] the beard with the right hand to kiss
[51:02] him but amasa took no heat to the sword
[51:05] that was in joab's hand so he smokee him
[51:08] therewith in the fifth rib and shed out
[51:11] his bowels to the ground and struck him
[51:13] not again and he died so joab and Abisha
[51:18] his brother pursued after Sheba the son
[51:21] of
[51:24] bitra this was nowhere in joab's
[51:30] orders nowhere in joab's orders did
[51:33] David tell him go take care of Sheba and
[51:37] oh by the way when you catch up to amasa
[51:40] I understand he's been dilator he hasn't
[51:43] met the timeline when you catch up to
[51:45] him just go ahead and kill my new
[51:46] captain of the host who I swore would be
[51:48] before me
[51:51] continually this was nowhere in the
[51:55] orders the was no even you know wink
[51:59] wink nod
[52:01] nod nothing he tells him go take care
[52:06] help him take care of this because if
[52:08] this continues to go on it's going to be
[52:10] worse than the Insurrection with absil
[52:12] so joab goes in as backup and his first
[52:15] role as backup is to knife the new new
[52:18] captain of the host that's
[52:22] right you know
[52:25] why cuz joab never repented for killing
[52:28] Abner right he's still running a red
[52:31] horse oh
[52:32] yeah he hasn't recognized the problem
[52:36] yeah this poor guy amasa had no idea
[52:39] what he was getting himself into if he
[52:42] would have had any sense about him when
[52:44] David said I'll make you the new captain
[52:45] of the host he'd have been like no
[52:47] thanks I like my fifth rib yeah I like
[52:50] it where it's at I like my intestines
[52:52] where they're at yeah it says joab hit
[52:56] him and struck him so fiercely that it
[52:59] disembed him and he never had to touch
[53:00] him again this was not an accidental
[53:03] slippage of the
[53:04] knife this was not leaning in to kiss
[53:07] him and oh whoops
[53:09] sorry this was intent to destroy this
[53:12] man who has taken my position from the
[53:14] minute he heard the word go yeah oh yeah
[53:19] no orders from the King no suggestion
[53:22] from the
[53:23] King only this is what Jo needs to do
[53:27] for
[53:32] joab acted like he was going to kiss the
[53:35] man yeah where have we heard that
[53:40] before acted like he was going to kiss
[53:42] the man and knifed
[53:44] him and one of joab's men stood by and
[53:48] said he that fath joab and he that is
[53:51] for David let him go after joab
[53:58] I'll agree with the first part of that
[54:00] he that fath joab go after joab but now
[54:04] one of joab's servants is rallying the
[54:07] troops under the name of David to follow
[54:10] joab as in okay David would sanction
[54:13] this it'd be okay who's following joab
[54:16] let's go to
[54:19] battle
[54:21] this Spirit had not only overtaken joab
[54:25] but now it's infiltrated the men under
[54:29] joab that now they don't even have a
[54:32] problem with this that's right no King's
[54:36] orders no King's suggestion no desire of
[54:39] the king an ex captain of the host could
[54:43] come for backup to the battle kill the
[54:46] current captain of the host who the king
[54:47] himself has declared I want to be the
[54:49] captain of the host he has just rendered
[54:51] the entire Kingdom into my hand he would
[54:54] come to him kill him
[54:57] and now his men don't say what' you do
[54:59] that
[55:00] for did David tell you to do that and we
[55:03] didn't hear no they immediately said
[55:05] whoever's for joab and whoever's for
[55:07] David let's
[55:10] go that might have been for joab but
[55:13] that wasn't for David
[55:18] right here's the Striking part of this
[55:21] whole topic and inspiration for me
[55:29] we've
[55:30] seen people and
[55:34] examples who wanted to be king they
[55:36] would kill the other king like they
[55:39] would have battles I want to own this
[55:41] territory you're in my way I need to be
[55:44] king over this territory we go to battle
[55:46] we fight it
[55:50] out
[55:52] joab I find nowhere in the scripture
[55:56] joab had any desire to be a
[56:01] king joab did not want to be number
[56:10] one but joab was not about to settle for
[56:14] anything but number
[56:18] two this is so striking for
[56:21] me you have an individual and a spirit
[56:25] working who will
[56:27] recognize I'm not going to be number
[56:31] one I'm not going to be
[56:34] first we can use the word King if we
[56:36] want but you understand what I'm saying
[56:38] I'm not going to be the best I'm not
[56:41] going to be recognized as the leader as
[56:44] number one as in
[56:46] charge but now I have this position and
[56:50] he earned his position fair and square
[56:52] joab did right in the beginning he
[56:54] earned his position fair and square
[56:56] there was a battle to be fought and
[56:57] David said whoever takes this I'll make
[57:00] you captain of the host and he earned it
[57:02] fair and square but now he's got this
[57:06] position and he's recognized David as
[57:08] king and he says that's fine you can be
[57:10] king I don't want to be king how easy it
[57:12] would have been for him to kill David no
[57:14] desire no no desire to do that though
[57:17] opportunity after opportunity after
[57:19] opportunity he's in close proximity to
[57:21] him all the time he never touches number
[57:25] one but but any perceived it don't even
[57:28] have to be a legitimate threat any
[57:31] perceived threat to spot number two your
[57:34] fifth ribs in
[57:36] trouble you're
[57:41] done see this is the point that I want
[57:44] to get at Saints is we can preach all
[57:46] day long you don't have to be the best
[57:49] you don't have to be number one you
[57:51] don't have to be in charge but that's
[57:54] still not even the real issue because if
[57:56] you get over that and you still think
[57:58] that you should be number
[58:04] two it's the same
[58:07] Spirit if there's 400 people and you
[58:11] think you should be
[58:12] 399 right we still
[58:17] wrong God
[58:20] right you see that's not big of a deal I
[58:22] mean there is 400 and I'm probably
[58:24] better than two of them
[58:30] in thine heart yeah that's right amen
[58:32] thy was lifted
[58:35] up in thy heart thy
[58:39] said you may factually be number
[58:44] four legitimately factually whatever
[58:48] example you want it to
[58:50] be you are the fourth
[58:52] best but if in your heart you think
[58:57] you're fourth
[58:58] best yeah right you still have the
[59:01] spirit of
[59:02] joab
[59:04] yeah in thine heart is the problem the
[59:08] issue is not whether we're fighting for
[59:10] first spot or second spot third spot
[59:15] whatever down the line that's the number
[59:17] is not the issue the issue is if we're
[59:20] fighting for any spot that's right yes
[59:23] sir now I'm using really generic
[59:26] terminology here but you can put this to
[59:29] whatever example you
[59:30] want
[59:34] yes and it'll work it'll
[59:41] apply we may not be the best message
[59:44] church but we're definitely in the top
[59:47] five
[59:57] all right let's just be
[1:00:01] real I don't want to be the pastor
[1:00:07] here but I'm sure going to be the better
[1:00:10] than all the other
[1:00:12] ministers I don't I understand I am not
[1:00:16] the most spiritual in the church but I'm
[1:00:19] at least in the top
[1:00:22] 10 start saying amen or I'll get really
[1:00:24] real
[1:00:26] I mean I'll start giving job
[1:00:27] descriptions at
[1:00:30] everything I may not be the best at
[1:00:32] cutting
[1:00:35] hair but I'm not the
[1:00:39] last where's my welders I might not be
[1:00:42] the best welder at the tank
[1:00:45] shop but I
[1:00:47] know def no there can't be more than
[1:00:50] four that's better than me and that's
[1:00:51] only because they've had 20 like years
[1:00:53] of experience if I had 20 years of
[1:00:54] experience I'd be in the top two
[1:01:05] you say well that don't happen oh it
[1:01:08] happens
[1:01:09] Saints it
[1:01:13] happens you know what's the astounding
[1:01:15] part of
[1:01:19] that we may not be the best message
[1:01:22] church but we're in the top five
[1:01:26] you can still be serving God's purpose
[1:01:28] you can still be doing the work of God
[1:01:30] you can still be preaching the word you
[1:01:31] can still be getting Souls saved you can
[1:01:33] still be having Deliverance you can
[1:01:35] still be accomplishing things joab was
[1:01:38] accomplishing stuff in between this
[1:01:41] whole Gap joab was still a part of the
[1:01:43] program and joab is accomplishing stuff
[1:01:46] he is overtaking cities he is destroying
[1:01:48] the
[1:01:51] Philistines that's right but in his
[1:01:54] heart that's right yeah yeah he's all
[1:01:57] messed up that's right true so just
[1:02:01] because we would have that mindset
[1:02:03] doesn't mean that all of the
[1:02:04] manifestations and all the workings and
[1:02:06] everything's just going to dissipate
[1:02:08] right we can still be doing there may be
[1:02:12] facts to support why we're top
[1:02:14] three
[1:02:17] right it's not like you just have this
[1:02:19] thought and now God says oh you had that
[1:02:21] thought boom you're out of the program
[1:02:22] you're gone you're done no joab
[1:02:25] continued working under King David right
[1:02:28] this continued manifestations were
[1:02:34] happening what was the other example I
[1:02:36] got oh I don't want to be the pastor
[1:02:39] here but I want to be the best backup to
[1:02:42] the
[1:02:46] pastor and factually speaking maybe it's
[1:02:50] so I'm not saying it is I'm just saying
[1:02:53] hypothetically what if it was so it's
[1:02:55] not not like if I have that thought
[1:02:57] remember gifts and callings are without
[1:02:59] repentance right God's not just going to
[1:03:02] snatch that gift out of there and it
[1:03:03] can't work anymore period no he may
[1:03:06] continue to use that and things may be
[1:03:08] getting accomplished that's right that's
[1:03:10] why brother bandam says that a man can
[1:03:12] take a Divine gift and send himself to
[1:03:14] hell with it that's right and souls
[1:03:17] would be saved under that
[1:03:21] Ministry being part of the program is
[1:03:23] not safe just because joab can go out to
[1:03:27] battle and say oh it's still working
[1:03:30] there's another city for King David it's
[1:03:32] still working I'm still captain of the
[1:03:34] host clearly
[1:03:35] anointed didn't mean that he was okay
[1:03:39] right right
[1:03:44] right so those examples that we gave the
[1:03:48] fact pattern can support those it can
[1:03:51] absolutely be
[1:03:53] legit but that's not the problem the
[1:03:57] facts aren't the
[1:03:59] problem thine heart our
[1:04:04] heart is what we have to
[1:04:07] examine like I said this is the
[1:04:10] astounding part of this when I really
[1:04:12] started digging into this is why didn't
[1:04:15] joab just make himself
[1:04:17] King he don't have to worry about
[1:04:20] somebody else taking his position as
[1:04:22] captain of the host in he can be king
[1:04:24] and captain of the the host if he wants
[1:04:26] to be why doesn't he just go for all of
[1:04:32] it but because of the way joab was made
[1:04:35] maybe he didn't like the politics of it
[1:04:38] maybe he just liked killing
[1:04:40] people maybe he just likeed to do batt I
[1:04:43] don't have time for all that King stuff
[1:04:44] you do the king stuff I'll kill
[1:04:46] everybody I don't know it's but we
[1:04:50] understand I say that kind of jokingly
[1:04:52] but we understand people are just wired
[1:04:54] differently like there's you could make
[1:04:56] me the president
[1:04:59] of artificial
[1:05:01] intelligence and I would be like no
[1:05:04] thanks you could be number
[1:05:08] one not interested no
[1:05:11] clue you understand what I'm saying
[1:05:14] there's things just within ourselves we
[1:05:16] have no interest in
[1:05:18] that but now okay you can be president
[1:05:22] you can be president of the entire
[1:05:24] nation
[1:05:27] no
[1:05:29] thanks no thanks I'm not wired that
[1:05:34] way that wouldn't fit
[1:05:38] me so there is people that don't want to
[1:05:43] be number
[1:05:46] one but for whatever reason they have to
[1:05:49] be number
[1:05:50] two whatever position that number two is
[1:05:54] understand it's not just a number two
[1:05:55] it's a
[1:05:58] position now if there was a position
[1:06:01] underneath the presidency of somebody
[1:06:05] who would
[1:06:06] specialize in removing dangerous
[1:06:10] wildlife from the citizens of this
[1:06:14] country also known as wh tail deer and
[1:06:18] turkeys and
[1:06:20] rabbits now now maybe we've got
[1:06:23] something worth fighting for
[1:06:27] but I don't have time for the other
[1:06:29] stuff not interested and I'm I don't
[1:06:32] know how joab was wired I don't know why
[1:06:34] he didn't just knife David under the
[1:06:36] fifth rib and become
[1:06:39] king but there is clearly this Spirit at
[1:06:42] work of an individual and a spirit who
[1:06:45] will not try to totally overthrow
[1:06:48] everything not
[1:06:51] totally it won't try to totally
[1:06:54] overthrow everything
[1:06:57] but anything that would threaten its
[1:06:59] position is not going to survive that's
[1:07:04] right this is a mystery to me I'm not
[1:07:06] saying I have the answer for this I I
[1:07:09] don't know how this works I don't know
[1:07:12] why I don't know how that
[1:07:15] is right but it is right and it's in the
[1:07:20] church that's right I'm not saying this
[1:07:22] church I'm saying it's in the spiritual
[1:07:24] realm it's in the church Realm
[1:07:26] you will have an individual who's not
[1:07:28] even called to a
[1:07:31] Ministry wreck havoc for the local
[1:07:34] assembly for a local assembly because he
[1:07:38] needs to be viewed in a certain
[1:07:39] spiritual position that's
[1:07:41] right he doesn't want to you understand
[1:07:45] what I'm saying you can have somebody
[1:07:47] who's not even called to be a song
[1:07:49] leader they're a
[1:07:51] musician but they will try to control
[1:07:53] the song service by their
[1:07:56] instrument they don't want to be the
[1:07:58] song leader but they want to control the
[1:08:00] worship
[1:08:04] service you
[1:08:07] can have a
[1:08:10] deacon doesn't want to be the pastor
[1:08:13] maybe not even qualified to be the
[1:08:15] pastor he doesn't even want to be the
[1:08:17] head
[1:08:18] Deacon but he wants to be known as the
[1:08:20] second most spiritual Deacon on the
[1:08:22] board
[1:08:28] well I might as well continue you can
[1:08:30] have
[1:08:32] trustees they he doesn't even want to be
[1:08:36] the second most reliable trustee but he
[1:08:40] is the third most reliable trustee if it
[1:08:43] can't get done the first time or the
[1:08:45] second time I'm your
[1:08:47] guy we can handle it the third time
[1:08:50] around that's what I'm known for don't
[1:08:53] try to threaten my position
[1:08:57] we laugh cuz this is comical but the
[1:08:59] spirit is
[1:09:01] real the spirit is real and the spirit
[1:09:03] will manifest
[1:09:07] itself I have got to keep moving my
[1:09:11] goodness First Kings 1 verse1 now King
[1:09:14] David was old and stricken in years and
[1:09:18] they covered him with cloths but he got
[1:09:21] no heat skipping to verse 5 then adah
[1:09:24] I'm going to have to just paraphrase
[1:09:25] some of this you all know this story
[1:09:27] anyhow okay so David's going to die they
[1:09:31] adah decides my father's dying now is a
[1:09:34] good time to exalt myself and make
[1:09:36] myself King we obviously know Solomon
[1:09:38] was supposed to be
[1:09:40] king but it says in verse 7 and he
[1:09:45] conferred not speaking of aiah and he
[1:09:48] conferred with joab the son of zarua and
[1:09:53] with abathar the priest and they
[1:09:57] following Adan Adan I'm sorry
[1:10:01] adania helped him I know I'm saying it
[1:10:04] right but I can't get it I'm saying it
[1:10:05] wrong but I can't get it right now sorry
[1:10:08] but and they helped him but zad the
[1:10:11] priest and beniah the son of JEA and
[1:10:14] Nathan the prophet and shemiah and Rah
[1:10:18] and the Mighty Men which belonged to
[1:10:20] David were not with
[1:10:23] adenah so it gives the list of people
[1:10:26] that he conferred
[1:10:28] with to overthrow David and it gives the
[1:10:31] list of people he did not confer with
[1:10:35] wonder why that's
[1:10:38] right and basba bowed this is verse 16
[1:10:43] and did Obi Ence unto the king and the
[1:10:45] King said what wouldest thou so we know
[1:10:48] Nathan the prophet discerned the
[1:10:49] situation came to Beth Sheba said hey do
[1:10:52] you recognize what adanah is doing she
[1:10:55] says didn't have a clue but I know
[1:10:57] Solomon's supposed to be king Nathan
[1:10:59] says you go talk to the king while
[1:11:00] you're talking to the king I'll come in
[1:11:02] I'll confirm your word and we'll get
[1:11:04] this straightened out and she said unto
[1:11:06] him my Lord thou swearest by the Lord
[1:11:08] thy God unto thy handm saying surely
[1:11:10] Solomon thy son will reign after me and
[1:11:12] he shall sit upon my throne and now
[1:11:14] behold Adan
[1:11:17] adania reth and now my Lord the king
[1:11:20] thou knowest it not and he hath slain
[1:11:23] oxen and fat cattle and sheep in
[1:11:25] abundance and hath called all the sons
[1:11:27] of the king and abathar the priest and
[1:11:30] joab the captain of the host but Solomon
[1:11:32] thy servant hath he not called so now
[1:11:37] joab recognizes
[1:11:41] something David's going to die
[1:11:46] right David's the one that gave me my
[1:11:49] position after I killed the other guy
[1:11:51] that he gave this position to but when
[1:11:54] David goes off the scene there's going
[1:11:57] to be a new king and this son of his is
[1:12:01] declaring that he's the new king and now
[1:12:03] he's came and he's conferred with me
[1:12:06] will you help me in my
[1:12:08] plan joab has spent his entire life
[1:12:12] right beside David could have killed him
[1:12:14] at any time and became king and he
[1:12:19] didn't but he recognizes David is about
[1:12:22] to die and he recognizes what his
[1:12:26] position is in Jeopardy again because
[1:12:29] who knows what will happen and who knows
[1:12:32] what a new king would
[1:12:34] do and we certainly just can't trust God
[1:12:37] to let this figure itself out and work
[1:12:39] its way
[1:12:45] out he
[1:12:48] says verse
[1:12:50] 20 uh Beth Sheba is still speaking and
[1:12:53] thou my Lord oh King the eyes of all is
[1:12:55] are upon thee that thou should us tell
[1:12:57] them who shall sit on the throne of my
[1:12:58] Lord the King after him otherwise it
[1:13:01] shall come to pass when my Lord thy King
[1:13:03] shall sleep with his fathers that I and
[1:13:05] my son Solomon shall be counted
[1:13:07] offenders and lo while she was yet
[1:13:09] talking with the King Nathan the prophet
[1:13:12] walks in as I just said he confirms
[1:13:14] everything ba Sheeba said uh let's skip
[1:13:18] on
[1:13:20] down 27 is this thing done by my Lord
[1:13:24] the king and thou Hast not not showed it
[1:13:25] unto thy servant who should sit on the
[1:13:27] throne of my Lord the King after him
[1:13:29] then King David answered and said call
[1:13:31] me Beth Sheeba and she came into the
[1:13:33] king's presence and stood before the
[1:13:35] king and the King swear and said as the
[1:13:37] Lord liveth thou Hast redeemed my soul
[1:13:39] out of all distress even as I swear unto
[1:13:42] thee by the Lord God of Israel saying
[1:13:44] assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign
[1:13:45] after me and he shall sit upon th throne
[1:13:49] in my stud even so will I certainly do
[1:13:53] it this day
[1:13:55] then Beth Sheeba bowed her face to the
[1:13:57] Earth and did reverence to the king and
[1:13:58] said let my Lord King David live forever
[1:14:01] and King David said call me zadok the
[1:14:03] priest and Nathan the prophet and beniah
[1:14:05] the son of JEA and they came before the
[1:14:11] king there was a list of
[1:14:14] people that add somebody say that name
[1:14:18] for me so I can say that ad say it again
[1:14:20] ad ad I'm sorry I just can't do it I'm
[1:14:23] going to call him Mr a cuz I can't say
[1:14:25] sorry I just
[1:14:27] can't the bad
[1:14:30] guy there was a list the bad guy did not
[1:14:33] want at this meeting that's
[1:14:36] right true but it's the same list that
[1:14:40] David wanted at his
[1:14:46] meeting call these people to
[1:14:49] me the king also said unto him take with
[1:14:53] you the Servants of your lord and cause
[1:14:55] Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule
[1:14:59] and bring him down to guihan and let
[1:15:02] zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet
[1:15:04] anoint him there King over Israel and
[1:15:06] blow ye the trumpet and say God save
[1:15:09] King Solomon then ye shall come up after
[1:15:12] him that may that he may come and sit
[1:15:15] upon my throne for he shall be king in
[1:15:17] my stead and I have appointed him to be
[1:15:19] ruler over Israel and over Judah and
[1:15:22] beniah the son of JEA answered the king
[1:15:24] and said said
[1:15:26] amen the Lord God of my Lord the king
[1:15:29] say so too and the Lord hath been with
[1:15:33] my Lord the king I'm sorry as the Lord
[1:15:36] hath been with my Lord the king even so
[1:15:40] be he with Solomon and listen to this
[1:15:43] statement and make his throne greater
[1:15:46] than the Throne of my Lord King
[1:15:49] David what a
[1:15:51] statement I just brought you into my
[1:15:55] counsil as a trusted advisor and as one
[1:15:58] that I could trust to carry out this
[1:16:00] plan that I wanted and your thanks to me
[1:16:02] is yes let's do that and I hope his
[1:16:04] Kingdom's better than
[1:16:13] yours joab would have never said that
[1:16:17] right joab would have said yes let all
[1:16:20] of that be done and by the way can you
[1:16:23] make sure that I stay captain of The
[1:16:24] Host
[1:16:26] but now bayah says yes amen I agree
[1:16:30] let's do that and let his kingdom and as
[1:16:33] God has been with you let him be greater
[1:16:36] and
[1:16:38] better
[1:16:40] why because this is what David wanted
[1:16:43] all along that's
[1:16:45] right this was David's heart's desire
[1:16:48] that's
[1:16:49] right what sounds like an insult is
[1:16:53] actually Beni tapping into the back part
[1:16:56] of David's mind and
[1:16:59] recognizing
[1:17:00] oh this is what he's going to do that's
[1:17:04] right yeah amen this is his son Solomon
[1:17:07] from his wife be Sheba and he's loved
[1:17:10] him so
[1:17:13] much I wonder what he would want done I
[1:17:18] wonder what how he would want Solomon's
[1:17:21] kingdom to
[1:17:23] progress I wonder
[1:17:25] how he would want things carried out see
[1:17:27] there's nothing in here about I wonder
[1:17:30] what my position is going to be he's
[1:17:31] already been given his position go and
[1:17:34] do this amen let's do it and I hope it's
[1:17:37] greater than anything you've ever
[1:17:43] done why does he have this
[1:17:45] mindset it's because he wasn't running
[1:17:48] around with the mindset of protecting
[1:17:51] bayah there is a scripture sidebar here
[1:17:55] but there is a scripture Isaiah 4031 I
[1:17:59] believe that says that we will raise up
[1:18:03] with wings as
[1:18:07] Eagles we will raise up the we will
[1:18:11] renew our strength and raise up with
[1:18:14] wings like
[1:18:18] eagles we will renew our strength and
[1:18:22] raise up I wonder if this is not not so
[1:18:25] much him sprinkling fairy fairy dust
[1:18:28] over us and saying now you're magically
[1:18:31] you have renewed strength and wings like
[1:18:34] eagles I wonder if us renewing our
[1:18:38] strength is simply just us not using our
[1:18:44] strength and letting him use his
[1:18:47] strength through us to do what he wants
[1:18:49] to do right rather than us constantly
[1:18:54] using our strength to the point of
[1:18:57] exhaustion trying to accomplish what we
[1:18:59] want done maybe it's and I I don't want
[1:19:03] to take any Supernatural away from that
[1:19:04] scripture but maybe it's not as
[1:19:06] Supernatural as what we think maybe us
[1:19:09] renewing our strength and being able to
[1:19:11] rise up like with wings like eagles
[1:19:13] we've already got Eagles Wings the old
[1:19:15] and the New Testament what is our
[1:19:17] problem that's holding us down and
[1:19:19] wearing out our strength is when we're
[1:19:21] not using his wings to raise up a a
[1:19:24] little
[1:19:25] higher and do what he wants but we're
[1:19:29] constantly clutching to something on the
[1:19:31] ground trying to tug on it because this
[1:19:33] is what I
[1:19:35] want if we would just let go of what we
[1:19:38] want right we wouldn't get so tired
[1:19:42] because we're not doing anything yeah
[1:19:45] and now by default our strength would
[1:19:48] come back to
[1:19:51] us see this is what bayah grab to hold
[1:19:55] of this is why beniah could see the
[1:19:57] purpose and the intent of what David
[1:19:58] wanted and why he would make it what
[1:20:01] seems like an insulting statement to
[1:20:03] David but it's exactly in line with what
[1:20:06] David would have wished right so zadok
[1:20:10] the priest and Nathan the prophet and
[1:20:11] beniah the son of JEA and
[1:20:14] the cherethites and the pites went down
[1:20:20] and caused Solomon to ride up on King
[1:20:22] David's mule and brought him to guon
[1:20:26] gyon and Z zadok the priest took an Horn
[1:20:30] of oil out of the Tabernacle and
[1:20:33] anointed Solomon and they blew the
[1:20:35] trumpet and all the people said God
[1:20:37] saved King
[1:20:40] Solomon now that this is 2 Kings 2:1 now
[1:20:43] the days of David Drew nigh that he
[1:20:45] should die and he charged Solomon his
[1:20:47] son saying I go the way of the earth be
[1:20:51] thou strong therefore and show thyself a
[1:20:54] man and keep the charge of the Lord thy
[1:20:56] God to walk in his ways to keep his
[1:20:58] statutes and his Commandments and his
[1:21:00] judgments and his testimonies as it is
[1:21:02] written in the law of Moses that thou
[1:21:03] mayest prosper in all that thou doest
[1:21:05] and whether soest whether soever thou
[1:21:08] turnest thyself that the Lord may
[1:21:11] continue his word which he spake
[1:21:12] concerning me saying If thy children
[1:21:15] take heed to their way to walk before me
[1:21:17] in truth with all their heart and with
[1:21:19] all their soul th shall not fail thee
[1:21:22] said he a man on the throne of Israel
[1:21:25] verse 5 moreover thou knowest also what
[1:21:30] joab the son of Zera did to me and what
[1:21:33] he did to the two captains of the host
[1:21:36] of Israel Abner and
[1:21:38] amasa and oh I'm sorry it just says that
[1:21:41] and unto Abner and unto amasa the son of
[1:21:43] Jeth whom he slew and shed the blood of
[1:21:47] war in peace and put the blood of War
[1:21:49] upon his girdle that was about his loins
[1:21:52] and in his shoes that were on on his
[1:21:55] feet do therefore according to thy
[1:21:58] wisdom and let not his whhe head go down
[1:22:00] to the grave in
[1:22:03] peace this is joab captain of the host
[1:22:07] who served with David I don't know for
[1:22:10] how many years how many decades that's
[1:22:13] right fought side by side with him did
[1:22:16] his bidding did did his
[1:22:20] command this is his end result that's
[1:22:23] right yeah David speaking to the new
[1:22:26] King
[1:22:27] Solomon he doesn't say remember joab and
[1:22:30] all that he has done for the Kingdom of
[1:22:32] Israel he says remember
[1:22:36] joab and what he did to me in other
[1:22:40] words properly discern
[1:22:45] joab properly discern joab's heart yeah
[1:22:50] and deal with him according to wisdom
[1:22:58] but show kindness unto the son of Sons
[1:23:01] of
[1:23:01] barzilla the
[1:23:04] gileadite gileadite and let them of
[1:23:07] those that eat at thy
[1:23:09] table and let them be of those that eat
[1:23:11] at thy table for so they came to me when
[1:23:13] I fled because of absum thy brother and
[1:23:16] behold thou Hast with thee shimi the son
[1:23:19] of I'm not going to go through this
[1:23:20] entire list David starts naming names
[1:23:24] he says remember
[1:23:26] joab remember
[1:23:30] Shima and deal with them
[1:23:33] accordingly David passes off the
[1:23:38] scene let's
[1:23:49] skip down to
[1:23:52] 14 so he said
[1:23:56] says now let's skip to
[1:23:59] 15 this is Mr a the bad guy whose name I
[1:24:02] can't
[1:24:03] say and he said thou knowest that the
[1:24:06] kingdom was mine and that all Israel set
[1:24:08] their faces before me and that I should
[1:24:09] Reign How be it the kingdom is turned
[1:24:11] about and has become my brothers for it
[1:24:12] was him his from the Lord and now I he's
[1:24:16] speaking to Beth Sheeba and now I ask
[1:24:18] one Petition of thee deny me not and she
[1:24:20] said unto him say on and he said speak I
[1:24:23] pray thee un to Solomon the king for he
[1:24:26] will not say to thee nay that he give me
[1:24:30] abishag the shunamite to wife and B
[1:24:34] Sheba said well I will speak to the king
[1:24:38] I will speak for thee unto the king so
[1:24:41] we know the story now basba comes to
[1:24:44] King Solomon she says this is what your
[1:24:46] brother has
[1:24:47] requested and he properly discerns it
[1:24:50] and he
[1:24:51] says um should I also give him the
[1:24:56] entire Kingdom and he says this is so
[1:24:59] interesting to me in verse 22 he says
[1:25:02] should we also ask for him the kingdom
[1:25:04] also for he is mine elder brother even
[1:25:07] for him and for abathar the priest and
[1:25:11] for joab the son of
[1:25:14] zarua the priest and joab had nothing to
[1:25:17] do with
[1:25:18] this but this is proper discernment this
[1:25:22] is not presuming this is proper
[1:25:25] discernment and now he says and he
[1:25:28] recognizes if this is what he's asking
[1:25:30] and this is what he wants me to do this
[1:25:32] would be equivalent to them
[1:25:35] accomplishing the Insurrection that they
[1:25:37] set out to do to begin with
[1:25:39] that's guess who gets added to the
[1:25:43] list Mr
[1:25:46] a now therefore as the Lord liveth which
[1:25:50] hath established me and set me on the
[1:25:52] throne of David my father and who hath
[1:25:53] made me and house and H has promised
[1:25:56] ananiah shall be put to death this day
[1:25:59] and King Solomon set sent by the hand of
[1:26:01] Bah the son of JEA and he fell upon him
[1:26:05] that he
[1:26:06] died now stay with me we're going to
[1:26:08] close in just a second when we go
[1:26:10] through
[1:26:11] this and unto abathar the priest said
[1:26:14] the king get thee to anoth unto thine
[1:26:20] own fields for Thou Art Worthy of death
[1:26:23] but I will not this time put thee to
[1:26:25] death because thou bearest the Ark of
[1:26:26] the Lord God before David my father
[1:26:29] because thou Hast been Afflicted and all
[1:26:31] wherein my father was
[1:26:32] afflicted so Solomon Thrust out abathar
[1:26:35] from being priest unto the Lord that he
[1:26:37] might fulfill the word of the Lord which
[1:26:39] he spake concerning the house of Eli and
[1:26:41] Shiloh then Tidings came to
[1:26:45] joab in other words joab hears what's
[1:26:49] going down
[1:26:54] for joab had turned after adanah though
[1:26:58] he turned not after absolum and joab
[1:27:01] fled unto the Tabernacle of the Lord and
[1:27:03] caught hold on the horns of the Altar
[1:27:06] and it was told King Solomon that joab
[1:27:08] was fled into the Tabernacle of the Lord
[1:27:10] and behold he is by the altar then
[1:27:12] Solomon sent bah the son of JEA saying
[1:27:15] go and fall upon him and bah came to the
[1:27:19] tabernac Tabernacle of the Lord and said
[1:27:21] said unto him thus saith the king come
[1:27:24] forth and he said nay but I will die
[1:27:27] here and beniah brought the king word
[1:27:30] again saying thus saith joab and thus he
[1:27:33] answered me and the King said unto him
[1:27:36] do as he hath said and fall upon him and
[1:27:39] bury him that thou mayest take away the
[1:27:41] innocent blood which joab Shed from me
[1:27:43] and from the house of my father and the
[1:27:46] Lord shall return his blood upon his own
[1:27:48] head who fell upon two men more
[1:27:50] righteous and better than he and slew
[1:27:52] them with the sword my Father David not
[1:27:55] knowing thereof to wit Abner the son of
[1:27:57] Nur captain of the host of Israel and
[1:27:59] amasa the son of Jeth captain of the
[1:28:02] host of Judah their blood shall
[1:28:04] therefore return upon the head of joab
[1:28:07] and upon the head of his seed forever
[1:28:09] but upon David and upon his seat and
[1:28:11] upon his house and upon his th Throne
[1:28:14] shall there be peace forever from the
[1:28:15] Lord so beniah the son of JEA went up
[1:28:19] and fell upon him and slew him and he
[1:28:21] was buried in his own house in the
[1:28:23] wilderness and the king put beniah the
[1:28:26] son of JEA in his room over the
[1:28:30] host beniah was made captain of the host
[1:28:33] my question to you is this what did
[1:28:36] benayah do to ensure beniah became
[1:28:39] captain of the
[1:28:42] host even when he was given
[1:28:45] orders to go and kill
[1:28:48] joab he recognizes the law of God this
[1:28:51] man has got a hold of the horns of the
[1:28:52] Temple
[1:28:55] he goes
[1:29:00] back he goes back to the king and says
[1:29:04] are you
[1:29:07] sure right I don't want to get into all
[1:29:10] the laws and regulations surrounding
[1:29:12] that but solom was totally justified in
[1:29:14] doing what he did where he did
[1:29:16] it but
[1:29:18] bayah did not run in there and say you
[1:29:21] know what
[1:29:25] it's finally my
[1:29:26] turn it's finally my turn I've longed
[1:29:30] for this
[1:29:32] day when he's out of the picture I know
[1:29:35] what's going to
[1:29:38] happen I am finally going to get what I
[1:29:41] deserve I am finally going to be in
[1:29:44] second
[1:29:45] place no bayah has this opportunity
[1:29:49] presented before him and he has direct
[1:29:52] orders from the King kill him and he
[1:29:55] runs back to the king and says are you
[1:29:58] sure right I don't want to do anything
[1:30:02] to displease the king I just want to
[1:30:04] update you about what the current
[1:30:05] situation is make sure that you got a
[1:30:07] real understanding of what we're doing
[1:30:09] here I don't have a problem doing it you
[1:30:11] just tell me to do it but are you
[1:30:14] sure
[1:30:17] God Solomon is looking at him no doubt
[1:30:21] thinking you realize you're going to be
[1:30:23] captain of The Host after you do this no
[1:30:26] Solomon don't even have that
[1:30:29] thought bah did not have to do anything
[1:30:33] to eventually end up in the proper
[1:30:35] position he should have been in to begin
[1:30:38] with nothing all he had to do was do
[1:30:43] what bayah was told to do yeah God and
[1:30:47] stay in the position bayah was in that's
[1:30:51] right and whenever it was time for to be
[1:30:55] upgraded and promoted and put into
[1:30:58] second place nobody was going to stop
[1:31:01] that amise God and it was done
[1:31:05] immediately he never had to shed Ence of
[1:31:08] blood he never never had to defy the
[1:31:10] king he never had to break the law of
[1:31:12] God and he certainly didn't have to lay
[1:31:15] around waiting for somebody that had
[1:31:18] been a blessing to him his entire life
[1:31:21] and the minute he saw weakness in him
[1:31:23] jump into a plan to kill
[1:31:27] him how
[1:31:30] repulsive David had did everything for
[1:31:33] joab joab won one battle and he won at
[1:31:37] fair and square and made himself captain
[1:31:40] of the host that was his legitimate
[1:31:43] reward but David did everything else for
[1:31:46] joab David was even the one that gave
[1:31:49] the proposition so David so joab could
[1:31:52] get in that position that's right
[1:31:55] and now joab as a thank
[1:31:59] you sat around and waited till his
[1:32:02] friend the
[1:32:04] King was going to
[1:32:07] die and instead of being a buddy when he
[1:32:10] really needed the
[1:32:12] buddy when he was down and out and weak
[1:32:15] and on his way
[1:32:16] out okay bring it up to date Saints when
[1:32:19] you had really made a mistake
[1:32:24] when somebody had really made a mistake
[1:32:26] when your brother your sister your
[1:32:28] pastor your Deacon your trustee your
[1:32:31] song leader yes your family member when
[1:32:34] they had really made a mistake when they
[1:32:38] were on the brink of death the point of
[1:32:40] no return they can't come back from that
[1:32:43] I don't want to be associated with that
[1:32:45] right when they really needed a
[1:32:50] bu when they really needed somebody to
[1:32:53] encourage them right how
[1:32:56] repulsive he turns his back on him and
[1:32:59] joins a scheme to R the kingdom away
[1:33:02] from him joab had spent his entire life
[1:33:06] trying to get the kingdom into David's
[1:33:11] hands and
[1:33:14] now when he thinks David is weak and on
[1:33:18] his way
[1:33:20] out instead of going over and been like
[1:33:22] hey but
[1:33:24] love you but we both
[1:33:26] know 's are coming what are we going to
[1:33:29] do what's your plan what can I do to
[1:33:32] help you to fulfill your
[1:33:36] plan that conversation never took
[1:33:40] place the only conversation that took
[1:33:43] place was joab sitting around talking to
[1:33:45] joab trying to figure out how joab could
[1:33:48] protect joab's
[1:33:51] position and if that means sacrifice the
[1:33:54] Gody that's been a blessing to me for
[1:33:55] decades
[1:33:58] yeah he should have known
[1:34:01] better but I'm certainly not going to
[1:34:04] spoil my skirts around
[1:34:05] that certainly not going to be part of a
[1:34:09] exiting
[1:34:11] party I still got to be number
[1:34:16] two right
[1:34:26] that spirit is not dead
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:37] Saints and that spirit because of the
[1:34:41] opening of the
[1:34:43] word can be more properly discerned much
[1:34:48] quicker when it starts operating
[1:34:55] I find it
[1:34:57] astounding of how quickly we will turn
[1:35:02] our backs on a man that
[1:35:07] falls when he has Faithfully tried to do
[1:35:12] the best that he can and I'm not I don't
[1:35:15] have any specific examples like don't
[1:35:17] wait for me
[1:35:20] to like there's no surprise here I'm
[1:35:22] talking principles I don't have a
[1:35:24] specific example I'm not if there's
[1:35:26] something going on I don't know what's
[1:35:28] going on and just don't even bother
[1:35:29] telling me here there or Yonder wherever
[1:35:32] I I have no clue of any examples I'm
[1:35:34] talking principles right
[1:35:37] now but I've had conversations with
[1:35:42] individuals over a a
[1:35:46] brother that has done something
[1:35:49] wrong and that entire conversation is
[1:35:53] how he he's done there's no hope for him
[1:35:56] I saw this
[1:35:57] coming I saw it coming he wouldn't
[1:36:01] listen to
[1:36:03] me nothing in that conversation about we
[1:36:07] got to pray for this
[1:36:09] guy he's really struggling right now no
[1:36:12] doubt this is hard on him you know he
[1:36:14] probably needs some encouragement right
[1:36:16] now none of
[1:36:18] that why is it always
[1:36:22] directly to keep keep digging his
[1:36:26] hole how many holes has God rescued us
[1:36:29] out
[1:36:32] of why can't we help dig him out of his
[1:36:35] hole rather than dig his hole deeper or
[1:36:39] her hole
[1:36:41] deeper because maybe by per chance if we
[1:36:44] get seen if somebody sees us talking to
[1:36:47] that
[1:36:48] brother or sister and encouraging
[1:36:52] them well those they'll lump us into his
[1:36:54] group you know that's the guy that just
[1:36:56] fell that's the guy that just really
[1:36:58] messed up and I seen so and so with
[1:37:11] him that spirit's not
[1:37:18] dead bayah didn't have to do anything
[1:37:22] for bah praise God all bah had to do was
[1:37:27] keep fighting the
[1:37:29] enemy and not fight his
[1:37:32] Brethren and even when he had direct
[1:37:34] orders from the King to fight his
[1:37:37] brother go back and check and make sure
[1:37:40] I got clarification here that's
[1:37:43] right
[1:37:45] right
[1:37:47] constantly constantly putting others
[1:37:49] before himself
[1:37:57] we're going to skip through the rest of
[1:37:59] this we know that the rest of the bad
[1:38:02] guys on the list Solomon says bah please
[1:38:05] go take care of them bah please go take
[1:38:07] care of this and bah please go take care
[1:38:09] of
[1:38:10] shimi at the end of that 46 so the king
[1:38:15] commanded bayah the son of JEA which
[1:38:17] went out and fell upon him and he died
[1:38:20] this was
[1:38:22] shimi the of verse 46 and the kingdom
[1:38:25] was established in the hand of
[1:38:30] Solomon the kingdom was not established
[1:38:33] in the hand of Solomon until bayah got
[1:38:36] done with what bah needed to do benah
[1:38:40] was the direct manifestation of what
[1:38:43] King David wanted done to Solomon and
[1:38:46] Solomon did not have everything in his
[1:38:49] power and his authority and properly set
[1:38:52] up the way way things needed to be until
[1:38:55] bah got done doing what bah needed to
[1:39:00] do I would dare to say that bah was
[1:39:03] instrumental in accomplishing what David
[1:39:07] wanted done with
[1:39:09] Solomon he had to be
[1:39:12] there and bah in all of these
[1:39:16] tasks wasn't running around trying to
[1:39:20] ensure that benah gets to stay captain
[1:39:22] of The Host
[1:39:23] after he takes this next one out or
[1:39:27] while I'm out taking care of what King
[1:39:30] Solomon's wanting me to do is there a
[1:39:32] threat to somebody else doing something
[1:39:34] better than me and getting a promotion
[1:39:36] to captain of the
[1:39:38] host there was none of that going
[1:39:41] on the definition of bayah in the Hebrew
[1:39:46] is God has
[1:39:49] built God has built
[1:39:53] not man has
[1:39:57] built benayah means God has done this
[1:40:02] amen saints of God as the musicians come
[1:40:05] I'm just going to have to close because
[1:40:06] if I keep going we're going to be here
[1:40:08] all
[1:40:11] night I do not want to be part of
[1:40:14] something man has
[1:40:18] built not position not program not not
[1:40:24] church not even
[1:40:27] manifestations nothing carnal nothing
[1:40:31] spiritual if man has built it I don't
[1:40:35] want any part of
[1:40:36] it I don't even care what position I
[1:40:39] would have in it maybe I'm number one
[1:40:42] maybe I'm number two maybe I'm number
[1:40:44] three if man has built it I'm
[1:40:48] out I don't want anything to do with
[1:40:51] it but if God is is doing
[1:40:54] it if God has built
[1:41:01] it I would count it a
[1:41:04] privilege to be number 400 out of 400 am
[1:41:07] amise
[1:41:09] God and you know what's really really
[1:41:13] powerful about position
[1:41:17] 400 is if God has put me in position 400
[1:41:22] yes I I will never be position
[1:41:27] 401 and I don't have to worry about what
[1:41:31] number 401 is doing better than me I
[1:41:35] don't have to worry if number 401 is
[1:41:37] more spiritual than me I don't have to
[1:41:40] worry if number 401 has a better
[1:41:42] Ministry than me he'll never be 400
[1:41:46] because God made
[1:41:50] 400 so now you're Ang anxiety can just
[1:41:54] go away your depression can just go away
[1:41:57] that's right and you can just rest in
[1:41:59] the fact knowing I am number 400 amen
[1:42:04] and God has made me number 400 yes and I
[1:42:08] just thank God I'm part of the
[1:42:11] number and if God has made you part of
[1:42:14] the number nobody can take you out of
[1:42:16] the
[1:42:18] number so now if I
[1:42:21] see number one or let's move on down to
[1:42:26] the list if I see number
[1:42:29] 15 making a mistake falling out of the
[1:42:32] way not being as spiritual as he should
[1:42:35] or really just being a bad guy I don't
[1:42:38] have a problem going to him and trying
[1:42:41] to encourage him to get back into
[1:42:43] position number
[1:42:44] 15 because as a result of that I'm never
[1:42:47] going to be more than
[1:42:50] 400 if he falls out of number 15 God
[1:42:53] will put somebody else in 15 but it's
[1:42:55] not me I'm 400 I know my
[1:42:58] position so why don't I try to keep
[1:43:00] number 15 in his position and if he by
[1:43:03] chance falls out let's let's prop him
[1:43:06] back up let's pray for him let's
[1:43:08] encourage
[1:43:09] him let's bring back to his memory
[1:43:12] You're Number
[1:43:15] 15 I'm using numbers but you can put
[1:43:17] positions in there whatever whatever
[1:43:20] example you want to put in there you get
[1:43:21] the principal amen
[1:43:23] amen if God has built it it's going to
[1:43:26] be sure and if God has built it we don't
[1:43:28] need to circumvent anything prise God if
[1:43:31] God has built it let's rest in what God
[1:43:33] has
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:40] built this Spirit was on
[1:43:43] Gaza Gaza was Elisha's
[1:43:48] servant walked with him talked with him
[1:43:50] slept with him ate with him saw all the
[1:43:53] Miracles you want to know what the end
[1:43:54] of Gesa was for two two pieces of silver
[1:44:00] they were big pieces but they were still
[1:44:02] just two pieces of
[1:44:05] silver the king of Syria comes to him
[1:44:09] Elisha heals him tells him to go dip
[1:44:11] gets heals of healed of his leprosy he
[1:44:13] says I will serve no other God but your
[1:44:15] lord now and he's all these presents for
[1:44:17] you for healing me Elisha says God did
[1:44:19] it not me keep your presence have a
[1:44:21] merry day
[1:44:23] haa yeah says what are you
[1:44:26] doing the king of Syria leaves he chases
[1:44:29] him down right and says my Lord just had
[1:44:33] some visitors and they could really use
[1:44:35] a couple of the things you have total
[1:44:37] lie by the way right the man says well
[1:44:40] don't just take that take this
[1:44:42] too he runs it back hides it in his
[1:44:45] house walks
[1:44:47] in Elisha says Gesa where have you
[1:44:51] been this is so astounding to me but
[1:44:55] this is a direct result of putting self
[1:44:58] in front of God that's right you become
[1:45:01] spiritually blind yeah Gaza had walked
[1:45:04] with Elisha for how many years he knew
[1:45:08] Elisha knew the secrets of
[1:45:11] everything and he asks him where he's
[1:45:13] been and he says I didn't go
[1:45:21] anywhere it's in astounding statement
[1:45:24] but I wonder if we've ever told God that
[1:45:27] when God has come by his word and says
[1:45:30] Where Have You Been yes and what have
[1:45:33] you been doing oh Lord I I
[1:45:36] I I wasn't trying to protect
[1:45:40] myself I didn't go anywhere I didn't do
[1:45:44] anything for
[1:45:46] me like he don't know your
[1:45:49] heart I didn't say it that way so that
[1:45:52] that person would think I was more
[1:45:53] spiritual I didn't Where Have You Been
[1:45:56] that's right what have you been doing
[1:46:01] right you keep protecting yourself and
[1:46:04] you keep looking out for self this is
[1:46:07] the result you eventually be looking
[1:46:10] into the face of the Prophet saying I
[1:46:12] didn't go
[1:46:14] anywhere and he already knows where
[1:46:16] you've been and what you
[1:46:17] did and now a curse
[1:46:20] comes the leprosy that was on the king
[1:46:23] of Syria you have it now get out of my
[1:46:25] presence this is the line brother
[1:46:27] brandham said a man could
[1:46:29] cross but you don't just get there
[1:46:31] overnight it's a process let's stand
[1:46:34] I've got to stop it's a process and the
[1:46:37] process begins with protecting self the
[1:46:40] process begins with Building self up the
[1:46:43] process begins with tearing somebody
[1:46:45] else down so that you can stay built up
[1:46:48] that's right I might not have to look
[1:46:51] the best but if I make them look worse
[1:46:54] than me then I would at least be better
[1:46:56] than them that's right whatever example
[1:46:58] whatever application you want to put it
[1:47:00] in the principle is still the same
[1:47:07] right I got to
[1:47:13] stop I don't want to be
[1:47:20] joab I think we can all agree
[1:47:24] please start playing
[1:47:26] something that things are going to get
[1:47:30] busier things are going to get
[1:47:34] faster things are going to get more
[1:47:37] difficult to
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:42] discern and we are
[1:47:46] probably going to be more prone to mess
[1:47:49] it up when it does
[1:47:54] the chances of messing things up are
[1:47:57] getting greater and faster and more
[1:48:02] likely unless I'm just living in a world
[1:48:04] all to
[1:48:05] myself like there is some confusing
[1:48:09] stuff going on that's
[1:48:11] right and again I'm not talking anything
[1:48:14] specific I have no specific examples I'm
[1:48:16] just preaching principles but can we all
[1:48:19] agree with this it's faster it's
[1:48:22] difficult the decisions the it's
[1:48:28] overwhelming I don't want to be
[1:48:33] guilty of hatching up a plan to
[1:48:37] overthrow my brother or my sister to
[1:48:40] keep myself looking
[1:48:42] spiritual just because they messed up
[1:48:44] when things were
[1:48:47] tough and I don't even want to
[1:48:50] take the attitude with they should have
[1:48:53] known better they were taught
[1:48:56] better they had better examples all of
[1:48:59] that's true but how many times did you
[1:49:01] have all of that and still messed it
[1:49:03] up how many times did I have all of that
[1:49:06] and still messed it up and you know what
[1:49:09] he didn't leave me he didn't leave you
[1:49:13] and he's our example that's right I
[1:49:16] don't want to take a joab spirit and be
[1:49:19] part of a plan hatched up to kick him
[1:49:22] while he's down or to kick her while
[1:49:24] she's down even if it cost me my
[1:49:27] reputation and it cost me a demotion I
[1:49:30] want to go to my brother or go to my
[1:49:32] sister and try to pick him up and prop
[1:49:34] them up and say long live the king
[1:49:39] right I don't want to be part of a joab
[1:49:42] plan sir amen but I want to be fully
[1:49:45] engaged in a benah plan am what God is
[1:49:49] doing what God is building amen
[1:49:53] that's what I want to be a part of let's
[1:49:55] pray together precious Lord
[1:50:00] Jesus just pray you take these broken
[1:50:04] words these many mispronounced
[1:50:09] words father and I
[1:50:11] pray that you would just let me have
[1:50:15] Grace in the eyes of the people and they
[1:50:16] would Overlook
[1:50:18] that but they would catch the
[1:50:21] principle that's being presented
[1:50:25] Lord father we are so grateful that we
[1:50:29] have had
[1:50:31] examples throughout the scriptures and
[1:50:33] we have had an example in our
[1:50:35] age of a man who would not try to
[1:50:39] promotee himself and not try to make
[1:50:42] himself something but through trial and
[1:50:45] error and through getting things wrong
[1:50:47] would come and humble himself and repent
[1:50:51] and tell us how to to do things properly
[1:50:54] Lord we thank you for that
[1:50:57] example I pray that we would take that
[1:51:00] principle that we would fully embrace it
[1:51:04] and that would we would make it a
[1:51:07] principle to live by because this is
[1:51:09] what you represented Lord you are the
[1:51:12] one who came and made yourself of no
[1:51:16] reputation to help those who really had
[1:51:19] no reputation who were Unworthy of a
[1:51:22] reputation
[1:51:24] you forfeited
[1:51:25] everything just to be in the plan of
[1:51:29] what God what the father had originally
[1:51:33] created you to do you were the one who
[1:51:36] said not my will but thine be
[1:51:39] done father may we take that attitude in
[1:51:42] every aspect of our life both
[1:51:44] spiritually and carnally may we never be
[1:51:47] guilty of trying to build our own Pro
[1:51:50] program or our own agenda or our own
[1:51:54] reputation but may we be happy and
[1:51:57] content and satisfied in what you have
[1:52:00] made us to
[1:52:01] be we commit ourselves to you we commit
[1:52:04] this evening to you in the name of Jesus
[1:52:07] Christ amen God bless you let's sing
[1:52:11] brother Chad if you'd please come my
[1:52:13] heart oh
[1:52:19] God make it ever
[1:52:27] true change my heart oh
[1:52:35] God may I be like you change my
[1:52:43] heart change my heart

[1:52:59] true change my heart oh
[1:53:07] God may I be like you you are the
[1:53:16] Potter you are the part
[1:53:25] I
[1:53:26] am the
[1:53:32] CL mold me and
[1:53:36] make
[1:53:40] me this is what I
[1:53:47] pray change my heart oh God
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:53:57] make it
[1:53:58] ever
[1:54:03] true change my heart oh
[1:54:12] God may I be
[1:54:15] like
[1:54:18] you
[1:54:20] amen I tell you that was an absolutely
[1:54:23] profound principle and I feel like our
[1:54:26] brother only had time to scratch just
[1:54:28] barely scratch the surface and I for one
[1:54:31] ask God to flesh it out more and more
[1:54:33] for us cuz there's so much there amen
[1:54:36] there is so much contrasting the life of
[1:54:38] joab and bayah but I know who I walked
[1:54:41] away wanting to be like I don't know
[1:54:42] about you but I wanted to be a bayah to
[1:54:45] my God I want to be a faithful servant
[1:54:47] who wants to please him and do what he
[1:54:49] says for him amen not for me me there
[1:54:53] was there was a couple things that that
[1:54:55] he said that just really struck me and I
[1:54:57] want to highlight them as we go he said
[1:55:00] when he talked about Lucifer said thine
[1:55:01] heart was lifted up that's the problem
[1:55:04] that was the problem everything else
[1:55:06] that followed was the result the problem
[1:55:08] was his heart was lifted up say God help
[1:55:10] us please help us and then when when he
[1:55:15] says uh the scripture out of Isaiah they
[1:55:19] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:55:21] their strength they shall Mount up with
[1:55:23] wings as an eagle I thought that whole
[1:55:25] explanation was wonderful that what's
[1:55:28] the precursor they that wait upon the
[1:55:30] Lord not to go and figure something out
[1:55:32] and make something happen just wait on
[1:55:34] the Lord when the Lord gives Direction
[1:55:36] then it'll work amen because now we
[1:55:38] don't go in our own mind bah was there
[1:55:40] all along friends bayah was one of those
[1:55:43] that was one of the mighty men with
[1:55:44] David when he was running cave to Cave
[1:55:46] before he was King he was there the
[1:55:48] whole time but I think my just my
[1:55:51] personal opinion I think the whole time
[1:55:53] he was only doing what David told him to
[1:55:55] do and he was content and happy doing
[1:55:57] what David told him to do but when you
[1:55:59] wait upon the Lord and his Lord was
[1:56:03] David amen amen then the one scripture
[1:56:07] that came to my mind that just really
[1:56:09] wrapped everything up for me was if you
[1:56:12] will save your life you will lose it but
[1:56:16] if you will lose your life for my sake
[1:56:19] you shall find it right and we saw that
[1:56:23] example man and joab
[1:56:26] unfortunately so God help us to get rid
[1:56:29] of
[1:56:31] self I don't know how to do it in our
[1:56:34] own power I don't know how to do it in
[1:56:35] my own strength but oh if we could ever
[1:56:38] get rid of self so that we don't need to
[1:56:39] protect self promote self uh uh uh
[1:56:43] provide for self or preserve self if we
[1:56:45] could just get rid of self everything
[1:56:48] would be all right and we could just put
[1:56:49] God first in every way I'm I'm leaving
[1:56:52] here amen with a desire in my heart to
[1:56:55] be a bayah to my Lord and let whatever
[1:56:59] God wants to do let I want to be one who
[1:57:01] God builds not where I built myself oh
[1:57:05] what a good lesson I just pray that God
[1:57:07] will let that go deeper this is
[1:57:09] extremely deep friends amen there was so
[1:57:11] many things firing off inside of me I
[1:57:13] wish brother Ben had all night am
[1:57:16] because I want this to go deep into my
[1:57:18] heart and change me forever amen let's

[1:57:28] so thankful that you brought one of your
[1:57:30] servants into this position that you
[1:57:33] could speak through his lips Lord for we
[1:57:35] recognize it's beyond our brother this
[1:57:37] was something you wanted to speak to us
[1:57:40] Lord God this is something you wanted to
[1:57:42] draw our attention to so we could have
[1:57:44] eyes to see so that we can be guarded
[1:57:47] against self so we can be guarded
[1:57:50] against pride and the things that plague
[1:57:53] human beings Lord they don't just plague
[1:57:55] human beings they plague us but God
[1:57:58] we've seen Lord through the word that
[1:58:00] you've delivered tonight God that that's
[1:58:02] not your plan for us we don't need to
[1:58:05] promote ourselves we don't need to
[1:58:07] preserve ourselves we don't need to
[1:58:09] provide for ourselves or to protect
