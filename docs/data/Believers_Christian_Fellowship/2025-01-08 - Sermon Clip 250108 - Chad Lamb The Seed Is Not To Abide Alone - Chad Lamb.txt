========================================

for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well when he before he even became material on Earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he know the color of your hair you would have he know all about you the only thing happened is when you being a sinner many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or little girl you walked you would walk walk around there and would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that you went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it amen so why are you sitting here tonight as a c gen of God Amen because you were part of God you were in God's thinking before the foundation of the world you always had eternal life you were always part of God but amen that part that seed was in you then but at some point the word called to the word amen and it come together and activated the word inside and that seed come to life and what caused that seed come to life when you died to the outside man and you recognized who you were and you surrendered your life to God and you died out and that seed came to life yeah but I don't believe that seed came to life which is a part of God only for you to have life right but maybe that seed came to life so that others could have life as well am so so many times we take an entrical view of everything in the gospel everything's about me God died for me God come to save me and there's truth and all of that but the problem is we keep getting so focused on self on self on self but Christ was never focused on self he was focused on the purpose of God he came to save that which was lost he came for Redemption everything he came for was so that he could give up everything Earthly amen for Eternal purposes he came to be the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so the question is why did you come amen maybe to serve an eternal purpose and maybe that Eternal purpose is more than just so that we could feel good and we could be happy and we could have a nice family and we can go to Heaven someday maybe there's more at stake maybe there's more to be expressed maybe there's more life that he was maybe there's more life that can come when I die died yeah and he lives
