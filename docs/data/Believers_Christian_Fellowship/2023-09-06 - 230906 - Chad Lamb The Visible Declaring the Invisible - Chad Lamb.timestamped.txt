[9:01] we're so thankful God that we can love
[9:03] you and we can express it here today
[9:06] it's by your grace Lord
[9:08] oh what a privilege it is for us to
[9:10] gather together like this
[9:12] we so appreciate you drawing us once
[9:14] again
[9:15] Lord as we go to look to your word now
[9:17] we pray you'd come on the scene
[9:19] that you'd break the bread of life for
[9:21] us Lord and Feed Us by your own hand
[9:24] but we've come as your sheep to the
[9:25] great Shepherd we've come as your
[9:27] children to your table to feed from you
[9:30] Lord but I pray you take this vessel
[9:32] under your control that you would help
[9:34] me to relax and move me out of the way
[9:36] and may you take over may you speak Lord

[9:45] than we've ever known before
[9:47] we love you father we thank you for
[9:49] these things you've given to us we look
[9:52] forward to this time and Jesus Christ's
[9:55] name we pray
[9:56] amen amen God bless you this evening
[9:59] while we're standing let's take our
[10:01] Bibles and turn to Hebrews chapter 11.
[10:05] amen I want to say how much we
[10:07] appreciated the Labor Day picnic and
[10:09] thank you to all those who made it
[10:10] possible and who worked and provided the
[10:12] place and God bless you and return unto
[10:15] you tenfold 100 fold what you gave out
[10:17] we had a wonderful time also want to
[10:20] remind all the young adults the 20 and
[10:23] up young adults that we have a young
[10:25] adults meeting this Friday at our house
[10:27] 6 30. remember doing questions and
[10:30] answers so I've gotten some really good
[10:31] questions and answers but if you forgot
[10:33] to get yours in you still have a chance
[10:35] so you can just give them to me after
[10:37] service email text however just give me
[10:40] your question and we'll go through that
[10:41] I also want to remind you I forgot on
[10:44] Sunday but if you have a special for the
[10:46] retreat please contact brother Ben colei
[10:48] and let him know so he knows how to
[10:50] arrange that so we're looking forward to
[10:52] that as well
[10:54] let's look here in Hebrews chapter 11
[10:56] verse 3.
[10:58] it says through faith we understand that
[11:00] the worlds were framed by the word of
[11:02] God so that the things which are seen
[11:05] were not made of things which do appear
[11:08] amen may God bless you as you take your
[11:10] seats may God help us as we look into
[11:13] his word
[11:14] so
[11:16] we looked at this on Sunday and I'm
[11:18] continuing on from Sunday I'd like to
[11:21] title this the visible declaring the
[11:23] invisible so if you remember Sunday we
[11:26] talked about the invisible is the real
[11:28] and then we want to talk about the
[11:29] visible declaring the invisible is this
[11:32] the next step in in my thought but we go
[11:35] back here to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 3
[11:37] and it says through faith we understand
[11:39] that the worlds were refrained by the
[11:41] word of God so that things which are
[11:43] seen were not made of things which do
[11:45] appear and when we talked about Sunday
[11:47] is the things that we see everything
[11:49] that we touch and see they were made of
[11:51] things that don't appear
[11:53] so the things that don't appear are a
[11:55] substance they are a reality
[11:57] and it's the reality that made what we
[12:00] call real is sub real
[12:03] that that's an odd thing I don't even
[12:05] know if that's a correct term so just
[12:06] stay with my thought and what I'm trying
[12:08] to say because if this Rio was made off
[12:11] something else that something else is
[12:14] more real than this real
[12:16] so this real what we know to be real
[12:18] amen the things which appear were made
[12:21] of things that do not appear so the
[12:22] things that do not appear were the
[12:24] substance before this was substance and
[12:26] this substance was made of that
[12:28] substance
[12:29] amen but it was an invisible substance
[12:32] amen but it's a substance nonetheless
[12:34] it's a reality nonetheless so it it you
[12:38] know the the odd part is about the way
[12:40] we've grown up the way we've understood
[12:43] things through this Natural Life we've
[12:44] understand a natural world through
[12:46] natural life through natural bodies
[12:48] through natural senses amen we we begin
[12:51] to get the idea that the things that are
[12:53] not tangible and the things that are not
[12:55] measurable are not real
[12:59] but the things that are not measurable
[13:02] and not tangible in this Dimension are
[13:05] the things that are more real than the
[13:06] things that are measurable and tangible
[13:09] amen remember there was a time when
[13:12] X-Ray when gamma ray when infrared was
[13:15] not measurable by man
[13:17] you know science had not progressed the
[13:19] understanding of men and not progressed
[13:21] so the invisible light waves that were
[13:23] always present amen were absolutely
[13:26] unknown to mankind he didn't know they
[13:28] existed amen at first they were a theory
[13:31] and then they had instruments and ways
[13:34] in which they could test the theory and
[13:35] prove that it was there and measure how
[13:37] much ultraviolet light there how much
[13:40] gamma ray is there how much of this and
[13:42] that is there and all of a sudden they
[13:43] begin they begin to make it tangible
[13:46] they begin to make it measurable but
[13:48] because it became measurable didn't make
[13:49] it real it was real before it was
[13:51] measurable
[13:53] amen so we've got to get away from this
[13:56] idea that this is real
[13:59] and that this is all the real there is
[14:00] that's real
[14:01] amen that's why I say this is sub-real
[14:04] this was made of something else that was
[14:06] real and that was real first
[14:08] so it's not that this isn't real but
[14:10] it's sub real
[14:13] until you keep going all the way back to
[14:16] where things came from amen where did
[14:18] the things that do not appear came from
[14:20] amen they they you go all the way back
[14:22] and you come back to God when God was
[14:24] alone with his thoughts and there was
[14:26] nothing else that was made that was made
[14:27] and that's why that's what I called the
[14:30] real real or the only real the original
[14:31] real the originator of all real
[14:34] and everything is a sub-real off of that
[14:37] reel
[14:38] praise God so like I said I don't know
[14:40] if my terms are correct but I think you
[14:42] get the thought amen that's the whole
[14:44] point now let's go over to Romans
[14:46] chapter 1.
[14:50] now you can see why this world we live
[14:54] in
[14:55] that's why faith is the
[14:57] faith is the substance
[15:00] faith is the evidence
[15:03] amen it doesn't have to be measurable by
[15:06] any other device or any other sense
[15:08] faith is the sixth sense that proves
[15:10] that it's there
[15:12] faith is enough amen it doesn't need
[15:14] anything more than faith in fact faith
[15:17] is it's not just that it's enough faith
[15:20] is the only thing that will allow us to
[15:22] tap into that reality
[15:24] is by faith
[15:26] it meant so faith is God's secret weapon
[15:29] for the believer and we know that faith
[15:32] that we have is God's faith and it's a
[15:33] gift
[15:34] so Romans chapter 1
[15:37] verse 19.
[15:39] because that which may be known of God
[15:41] is Manifest in them for God hath showed
[15:43] it unto them for the invisible things of
[15:46] him from the creation of the world are
[15:48] clearly seen being understood by the
[15:50] things that are made even as eternal
[15:52] power in Godhead so that they are
[15:54] without excuse
[15:56] amen because that when they knew God
[15:58] they glorify him not as God neither
[16:00] we're thankful but became vain in their
[16:02] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[16:04] darkened so I'd like reading this
[16:06] because it says we'll go back to verse
[16:09] 20.
[16:10] for the invisible things of him from the
[16:12] creation of the world are clearly seeing
[16:14] being understood by the things that are
[16:16] made even his eternal power on godhead
[16:19] so God now begins to make a creation and
[16:22] and we know brother bam said that he
[16:25] believed the first thing that he made
[16:26] was the Angels amen because God was he
[16:29] wanted to be God an object of worship
[16:31] but in the beginning he wasn't even God
[16:33] yet because there was nothing created to
[16:35] worship him he was Elohim the great
[16:38] self-existing being the person God Amen
[16:41] but he he now evoked upon himself the
[16:44] title of God when he created the
[16:46] heavenly host and now they could worship
[16:48] him making him God
[16:50] but he was always the great Elohim the
[16:53] self-existing one he needed nothing else
[16:55] for existence that's why he's the
[16:57] original
[16:59] amen but in him were thoughts attributes
[17:03] amen and these were come into expression
[17:05] and as he began to express he expressed
[17:08] a Heavenly Host he he expressed a
[17:10] Heavenly realm he expressed that an
[17:13] Earthly realm and now the things that
[17:15] are are invisible are seen by the things
[17:18] that are made so the things that are
[17:20] made are to reflect back or point to
[17:22] something that's invisible
[17:24] not so that we would see what's made and
[17:27] stop with what's made but this what what
[17:29] God was doing in creation was beginning
[17:31] to express what was in The Invisible
[17:33] Realms begin to express what was in his
[17:36] mind
[17:37] and so when when he begins to express
[17:39] that amen we are not to stop at the
[17:42] expression and say this is it this isn't
[17:45] it this is reflecting what's it
[17:48] we're supposed to go beyond and look at
[17:50] this and see God and move past it to God
[17:52] Amen
[17:54] that's why it this modern humanism and
[17:57] this scientific age amen that that makes
[18:01] uh makes themselves people make
[18:03] themselves God Amen and they take the
[18:05] world and they manipulate the world for
[18:07] their own purpose amen that's a work of
[18:09] Cain amen Cain took the creation of God
[18:11] and began to manipulate the creation of
[18:13] God for his own purpose
[18:15] and this whole scientific world that's
[18:17] why brother bear says Hey amen we're not
[18:20] going to have a a scientific age
[18:22] Sciences of the devil Amen brother
[18:23] Benham is not saying discovering and
[18:26] experimenting and knowing the world is
[18:28] devilish that's not what he's saying but
[18:30] if you look at the difference between
[18:31] Cain and Seth and they're two lines amen
[18:34] Seth amen followed the flocks around
[18:36] amen and he lived with nature and with
[18:39] the land then he followed the flocks and
[18:41] they grazed and they moved about on
[18:43] God's Earth amen but Cain Cain was a
[18:46] tiller of the soil amen he was moving
[18:49] the Earth and tilling the soil and
[18:51] working in creation and he was
[18:52] extracting out of that things for his
[18:55] own self for his own Glory
[18:57] and how do we know that because when he
[18:59] separated from God and went to the land
[19:01] of non amen he had a son and after he
[19:04] built a son he builted a city where did
[19:06] he get the material for the city he got
[19:08] it out of the Earth
[19:10] right and that that's this whole
[19:13] scientific notion amen man becomes his
[19:16] own God and begins to manipulate
[19:17] everything God made for his own self for
[19:20] his own purpose for his own Pride for
[19:22] his own establishment amen but that's
[19:25] not why God gave it God gave it to
[19:27] declare him
[19:29] not to make man their own Gods amen and
[19:32] proud and arrogant and repurpose
[19:35] everything God made for their own
[19:37] purpose that's not why it was created
[19:39] it was created to declare God
[19:42] that's what's wrong with science
[19:48] and the message Harvest Time
[19:51] brother mayor said God the great creator
[19:54] let's try to speak on the form of nature
[19:56] pick him up in the nature first to bring
[19:59] it back to the word now nature runs just
[20:01] with the word because God is a creator
[20:03] of nature when you see the way nature
[20:06] Works find out that's the way that's my
[20:08] that's my first Bible was to find find
[20:12] out how nature find God I found God in
[20:14] nature so brother Benson his first Bible
[20:16] was nature because it was created to
[20:18] reflect something about God
[20:20] amen even the heavens the whole Heavenly
[20:23] Host amen God wrote his first Bible in
[20:25] the heavens amen so creation was there
[20:27] to declare the glory of God
[20:29] God created it and he spread it out to
[20:32] tell his story amen so man would know
[20:34] God and that's why he he put the
[20:36] heavenly host in place
[20:39] amen
[20:40] so man is missing the invisible he's
[20:44] missing what this visible is to declare
[20:48] and the message things that are to be
[20:52] he says now but remember these are only
[20:54] temporal gifts in time now we know that
[20:57] Moses in building the Tabernacle in the
[20:59] wilderness are preparing it he said he
[21:01] made all things after the order of what
[21:03] he saw in heaven so the Earthly things
[21:05] only express what the Eternal Things Are
[21:08] into this Earth that we live in today
[21:10] being so great as we love it and love to
[21:13] live and breathe the air and see the
[21:15] flowers and things if this here is the
[21:18] expression one that's dying is only
[21:20] expressing one that's Eternal when you
[21:22] see a tree struggling pulling trying to
[21:24] live that means there's a tree somewhere
[21:26] that doesn't have to do that
[21:28] when you see a man here struggling to
[21:30] live somebody in a hospital or on a sick
[21:33] bed or an accident struggling and the
[21:35] death rattles in their throat and
[21:36] pulling and crying and screaming for
[21:38] Life what does that mean there's a place
[21:40] somewhere there's a body that doesn't
[21:42] struggle and scream for that it just
[21:44] doesn't do it
[21:46] now there they are temporal gifts to us
[21:48] these things only expressing that there
[21:51] is one where it's the Eternal one that's
[21:54] what Jesus has gone away to prepare of
[21:56] the Eternal one for us now they only
[21:58] express there's a greater of the same
[22:01] kind because these are a same kind
[22:04] so now if you see a tree struggling to
[22:06] live there's a tree somewhere that
[22:08] doesn't struggle
[22:09] this world is only to reflect that one
[22:12] amen and and that one is the the
[22:15] original real or the more real
[22:18] praise God
[22:21] so let's go to John 1 1.
[22:25] trying to lay down this thought here
[22:29] let's go to John 1 1 and begin
[22:32] looking here
[22:38] no
[22:39] in John 1 1 it says in the beginning was
[22:42] the word and the Word was with God and
[22:45] the Word was God
[22:48] and brother Brandon tells us uh it says
[22:51] he asked the question what is a word a
[22:53] word is a thought expressed
[22:56] so it's the expression of a thought and
[22:59] brother Frank if you could pull up the
[23:00] white board I'm going to write this down
[23:02] on the Whiteboard
[23:03] so in the beginning was the word and the
[23:07] Word was with God and the Word was God
[23:09] why is that because the word originated
[23:11] as a thought
[23:13] the original form of the word is a
[23:15] thought Amen in the word is a thought
[23:17] expressed amen so it's it's in line with
[23:20] the thought so
[23:23] first you have
[23:30] first you have thought
[23:33] then you have word
[23:36] right
[23:37] so a a word is a thought expressed so
[23:41] what's the original form of word it's
[23:43] the thought
[23:45] that's where that's where the word came
[23:47] from it came from the thought that's why
[23:50] the word was with God and the Word was
[23:52] God
[23:53] that's right so when God begins to
[23:56] express amen what's in his thinking
[23:58] what's been in the in the mind of God
[24:01] the way he expresses that is by a word
[24:03] and the word is the thought now
[24:05] expressed so if I want to go beyond word
[24:08] I go back to thought that's the original
[24:11] amen praise be to God
[24:15] so then
[24:16] says it in the message Christ is
[24:19] identified the same in all generations
[24:20] said God like in the beginning he was
[24:23] just God
[24:24] well he wasn't really God he was just
[24:27] the Eternal our English word god means
[24:30] an object of worship and there was
[24:31] nothing to worship him he was
[24:33] self-existing Elohim so there was
[24:35] nothing to worship him so he was just
[24:37] the great Eternal but in him was
[24:39] attributes an attribute is thoughts just
[24:43] like you have to think of anything
[24:44] before you speak it then when you speak
[24:47] it becomes a word and then he and then
[24:50] he is the Eternal and in him was
[24:52] attributes and he spoke it and it was
[24:54] the word and the word is made manifest
[24:57] and as the word is made manifest it's
[25:00] God becoming material
[25:03] praise God so now the word
[25:07] where are we here
[25:10] now the word expressed
[25:17] uh sorry f
[25:19] manifest
[25:21] or manifested
[25:24] so the the the thought is the original
[25:28] from the thought comes the word and when
[25:31] the word amen is materialized it's
[25:35] manifested and when it's manifested it's
[25:38] now the thought
[25:40] manifested and brother bear said it's
[25:42] God becoming material
[25:46] amen
[25:48] oh praise God it is God why because God
[25:53] was alone with his thoughts his his
[25:56] thoughts I I don't know how to say this
[25:59] because you know my whole dilemma with
[26:01] language right language is a problem but
[26:04] when you think about God Alone with his
[26:06] thoughts then God wasn't alone he had
[26:09] his thoughts and so God I say if you can
[26:11] say it this way God is the summation of
[26:13] his thoughts
[26:15] you say that those are his attributes or
[26:17] our characteristics of himself are part
[26:20] let's just say like this the thoughts
[26:22] are particles of God
[26:24] and all the thoughts of God are God
[26:29] that's right
[26:30] so when the thought now comes as
[26:33] expressed as a word amen that's why
[26:35] that's why the word was with God as a
[26:39] thought amen and it was God but now that
[26:43] thought is moving into an expression and
[26:45] becoming word
[26:46] all right and it become it can become
[26:48] just one of those I say particles or
[26:51] thoughts or genes or attributes there's
[26:53] so many ways that we try to describe
[26:55] this depending on how we're describing
[26:57] it but it's the same thing something
[26:59] amen from the the mind of God God's
[27:01] thought amen has now moved into a state
[27:05] of expression and now that's word amen
[27:07] and then that word when it becomes
[27:10] manifested or materialized it is God
[27:13] becoming materialized because God is the
[27:16] thought
[27:17] the thought is God they're one in the
[27:19] same
[27:20] amen so I want to I want to look at
[27:23] something else here if I can we say this
[27:27] thought God was alone with his thoughts
[27:32] I'll be just be patient with me as I
[27:34] teach I don't want to breathe through
[27:35] this I just want to take some time and
[27:37] it's not new territory we've been
[27:38] through this but it's so important
[27:39] because this is so contrary to our human
[27:42] thinking
[27:43] it's so opposite to the world we live we
[27:46] live in we have to really stop amen and
[27:48] really listen to what the prophet's
[27:50] trying to teach us and see it in
[27:52] Scripture
[27:53] so we say God's thoughts
[27:59] are eternal
[28:03] is that right
[28:04] are God's thoughts eternal
[28:07] okay but brother Adam said God is the
[28:09] only thing that is eternal
[28:12] so if the thought is eternal then the
[28:14] thought is God
[28:16] if you're catching this
[28:18] so if the thought
[28:21] if if the thought is eternal the only
[28:24] thing Eternal is God so the thought is
[28:27] God
[28:28] so if one of those thoughts God had was
[28:30] about me coming into manifestation It's
[28:33] actually an expression of God coming
[28:36] into materialization as God becoming
[28:38] material and so it's eternal
[28:42] right
[28:44] so then when we look at these thoughts
[28:51] this is the part that's challenging
[28:54] so the thoughts of God are eternal so
[28:57] God we know before he created anything
[28:59] he he had a a thought he had a concept
[29:03] he he wanted to be expressed this is
[29:06] what God's desire was to be expressed
[29:08] and and We Know by by the message that
[29:11] God wanted to express himself and he
[29:14] wouldn't Express himself as a family of
[29:16] God upon the Earth and he wanted to
[29:18] express this great invisible being who
[29:20] was alone with his thoughts he wanted to
[29:21] express himself so he'd bring his
[29:23] thoughts into materialization and that
[29:26] would be the family of God Amen and that
[29:28] would be God materialized or the family
[29:31] of God and fellowship and expression
[29:33] expressing God
[29:35] all right and and we we talk about that
[29:38] like we know it and I mean we I think we
[29:40] barely know it I think we barely have a
[29:42] fraction of the understanding of what
[29:43] that really is
[29:45] so even when you say it I'm like I'm
[29:47] afraid to say it because I'm probably
[29:49] saying something wrong but that's the
[29:50] best I understand
[29:52] so then you say Well when God thought in
[29:55] the beginning he had a plan and in that
[29:57] plan he was going to express all his
[29:59] attributes so part of him was to be a
[30:01] Healer part of him was to be a savior we
[30:03] know that so in order to be a Healer
[30:05] something had to be lost in order or
[30:06] something had to be sick in order to be
[30:09] a savior something had to be lost to be
[30:10] a redeemer something had to be lost so
[30:12] we know that when God thought of this
[30:14] plan of the way he would Express himself
[30:16] he had to think of the Fall
[30:20] is that right
[30:21] because there had to be a fall for these
[30:24] attributes of God to be expressed so if
[30:26] God thought of a fall he had to think of
[30:29] Lucifer and they had to think of Lucifer
[30:31] falling and Lucifer becoming the devil
[30:33] because he knew the end from the
[30:34] beginning
[30:35] God's had no new thought I'm in the
[30:37] Lamb's Book of Life was written before
[30:39] the foundation of the world and Jesus
[30:40] Christ was the lamb slain before the
[30:42] foundation of the world is that right so
[30:44] that means God knew that we would need a
[30:46] sacrifice he knew he would come in flesh
[30:49] Amen to be that sacrifice that's part of
[30:51] expressing his attributes is that right
[30:53] so then I asked you is not the fall
[30:57] part of God's thought
[31:00] is not Lucifer the devil part of his
[31:03] thought
[31:05] yeah
[31:06] but Lucifer is not Eternal because we
[31:09] know he'll be annihilated
[31:13] are we on the same page
[31:15] so this is just this is just the best I
[31:19] can do so just hang with me and try to
[31:20] understand what I'm saying don't cabbage
[31:22] down on definitions of words because
[31:24] that's going to get hard
[31:27] but when God was alone with his thoughts
[31:30] and those thoughts were Eternal and
[31:32] those thoughts were attributes
[31:34] those were a specific kind of thoughts
[31:38] not everything he would ever think as he
[31:40] devised his plan
[31:42] but in the original the thoughts were
[31:45] the thoughts
[31:47] of himself
[31:54] I hope you're catching what I'm saying
[31:58] the thoughts that are Eternal were the
[32:01] thoughts of himself
[32:03] how he would manifest himself how he
[32:05] would display himself how he would
[32:07] materialize himself these are the
[32:09] Eternal thoughts of God
[32:12] and in order to make this manifestation
[32:15] he would have to think of a Plan of
[32:18] Redemption and a fall in the backdrop of
[32:20] black now those thoughts are secondary
[32:23] thoughts
[32:25] I hope you understand and listen I don't
[32:27] think God thinks like we do either I
[32:29] mean we're human beings we're thinking
[32:30] oh I had a good thought now I have
[32:32] another thought I don't think it was
[32:33] like that I don't know how else to
[32:35] explain this but we know that if the
[32:38] thoughts of God are Eternal then those
[32:39] are the thoughts of God about himself
[32:43] amen
[32:45] and if we are seeds of God if we are
[32:49] children of God then we had to be part
[32:51] of that thinking in the beginning when
[32:53] God was thinking of himself
[32:55] manifesting himself and all the ways in
[32:59] all the attributes and all the all the
[33:01] particular ways he would manifest
[33:02] himself we were part of that thinking
[33:04] making that Eternal thought and that
[33:07] thought about us making part of us part
[33:09] of the Eternal making us part of God
[33:13] praise God
[33:14] so I hope I hope that clears some things
[33:17] up and doesn't muddy anything up for you
[33:21] amen so let's let's read this next quote
[33:26] in future home brother Ben says so God
[33:28] in the beginning when he thought of you
[33:30] and thought of others like that thought
[33:32] of himself thought of himself of being
[33:35] tangible so what was God thinking he was
[33:38] thinking of himself being tangible
[33:40] that's what I say the Eternal thought of
[33:42] God is God thinking of himself becoming
[33:45] tangible
[33:46] that was his thoughts
[33:49] so he expressed his thoughts by word
[33:52] so what was his thoughts his thoughts
[33:54] were himself the thoughts of himself
[33:56] about himself how he would declare
[33:58] himself and how he'd manifest himself
[34:00] how he would show himself
[34:03] amen
[34:04] so let's go back if I can
[34:08] all right we'll go back to this
[34:11] okay
[34:13] so now let's go we were in John 1 1
[34:16] let's read that again in the beginning
[34:18] was the word and the Word was with God
[34:20] and the Word was God now you can see now
[34:24] you can see why the word was with God
[34:26] and the Word was God it was there as a
[34:28] thought now the thought is expressed
[34:30] amen and and it's amazing that when God
[34:33] Amen when God the brother bam tells us
[34:36] the first thing that come out of God was
[34:37] the word and it took on the form of
[34:39] logos or Pillar of Fire or lie amen and
[34:42] all the attributes all the thoughts all
[34:44] the word of God was there amen and he
[34:46] called that son because it came out of
[34:48] him
[34:50] amen and it wasn't different than him it
[34:53] was an expression of him and that
[34:55] expression of him he called it son
[34:59] so now the word was the word was with
[35:03] God the Word was God now the word has an
[35:07] expression
[35:08] okay and that's gone but it still
[35:11] doesn't change the fact that God ever
[35:13] Remains The Invisible unchanging Elohim
[35:16] this is a way he's expressing himself
[35:19] but it's still him
[35:21] it's got the fullness of him because
[35:23] it's the full thought of himself
[35:25] amen
[35:26] so in that
[35:30] in that uh logos were all the thoughts
[35:35] of God
[35:36] all the word because that was the word
[35:38] so that means you and I were in the
[35:40] logos
[35:42] amen that's why we eventually will come
[35:44] forth as little clinkers off of the Sun
[35:47] praise God
[35:49] all right so now let's go to verse 14.
[35:55] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[35:58] among us and we beheld his glory the
[36:00] glory of the only begotten of the father
[36:01] full of grace and truth and now the word
[36:04] that was in logos form now it comes down
[36:07] through time and it's made flash so all
[36:10] of the thought that moved into the logos
[36:12] which was the fullness of the thought
[36:13] amen now that moved down in in God built
[36:17] a body of Flesh and that moved down into
[36:19] flesh and that was Jesus Christ the word
[36:22] made flesh amen
[36:25] now let's go to verse 18.
[36:28] no man has seen God at any time the only
[36:31] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[36:33] the father he hath declared him amen why
[36:37] because the word declares the thought
[36:40] and God is the thought he's the
[36:42] summation of his thought of himself amen
[36:44] and now that thought took on word and
[36:47] that word took on flesh and now the son
[36:49] declared the father amen so now when you
[36:52] want to know what what the thought was
[36:54] look at the look at the sun the sun is
[36:56] declaring to you what the thought was
[36:58] that God wanted to become flesh
[37:02] that was the thought
[37:04] praise God
[37:06] the Bible also calls him the image of
[37:08] God
[37:09] and the express image of God that's who
[37:13] Jesus Christ is
[37:14] let's go to John 14 while we're here in
[37:16] the Book of John
[37:22] John 14 verse 6.
[37:31] Jesus said unto him
[37:33] I am the way the truth and the life no
[37:35] man cometh unto the father but by me
[37:38] if you hadn't known if you had known me
[37:40] you should have known my father also and
[37:43] from henceforth you know him and have
[37:46] seen him
[37:47] Philip saith unto him Lord show us the
[37:49] father and it suffices us Jesus said
[37:52] unto them have I been so long time with
[37:54] you and yet hast thou not known me
[37:56] Philip he that has seen me have seen the
[37:59] father and how saith thou show us the
[38:02] father believe us thou not that I am in
[38:04] the father and the father in me the
[38:06] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[38:08] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[38:10] in me he doeth The Works believe me that
[38:13] I am in the father and the father in me
[38:15] or else believe me for the very work's
[38:17] sake so Jesus now is is the word made
[38:20] flash into one Among Us and in in and
[38:23] Jesus is telling them that I am the way
[38:26] the truth and the life no man cometh
[38:28] into the father but by me so you always
[38:31] have to come by the word
[38:34] if you had known me you should have
[38:37] known my father why because if you know
[38:39] the word you know the father because the
[38:42] no the word is the know the thought
[38:44] that's why you can memorize your Bible
[38:47] but that's not knowing the word
[38:50] amen that's being able to read but
[38:52] that's not knowing the word the word is
[38:54] the thought expressed amen and if you
[38:56] can read the word but you don't get the
[38:58] right thought then you don't have the
[39:00] word you have you have literacy you have
[39:03] the ability through education to read
[39:04] but just because you can read it doesn't
[39:07] mean you know the word
[39:09] because the word is the thought
[39:10] expressed so in order to know the word
[39:12] amen you have to have a revelation that
[39:14] takes you back to the original thought
[39:16] so that you know what that word is
[39:18] meaning
[39:20] that's why Jesus said now when he was
[39:22] the fullness of the word bodily when he
[39:24] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[39:27] when he was the word made flash he says
[39:29] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[39:30] of course amen if you knew him you would
[39:33] know the father if you understood what
[39:35] this was you would know the father
[39:36] because he was the full thought of God
[39:38] standing in flesh
[39:42] why because it's God's desire to become
[39:45] tangible
[39:46] amen
[39:48] so let's go down a little further now
[39:51] in the the in the church age book in the
[39:54] Sumerian Church age the prophet of God
[39:56] says according to Romans 4 16 we find
[39:58] that God has given a sure promise to all
[40:01] of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself
[40:04] in all believers under that designation
[40:06] because he says Abraham who is the
[40:09] father of us all now the Apostle Paul is
[40:12] doing something interesting here and and
[40:14] I mean it's amazing that brother Branham
[40:16] can come and pick these things up I
[40:18] don't know I I I'm more amazed all the
[40:21] time the more I study the Bible the more
[40:23] I study the message the more mesmerized
[40:26] I am that God could take brother Branham
[40:28] with a seventh grade education out of
[40:30] the hills of Kentucky amen and he could
[40:33] explain and he could preach such deep
[40:35] mysteries of God I mean it's phenomenal
[40:38] and the more I study the Bible the more
[40:40] I realize that man absolutely stayed
[40:43] True to this word in every way even when
[40:46] I was confused and what he was saying I
[40:48] was confused because I didn't have the
[40:50] right picture of the word
[40:53] I was reading words but I wasn't
[40:54] catching their meaning
[40:56] and here God by my by a gift in the men
[41:00] and by Revelation he has him being able
[41:02] to preach Amen in such and such such a
[41:05] simple man such such profound things
[41:09] that we're still trying to just get a
[41:11] hold of Amen they're so deep and they're
[41:13] so unbelievable that we're still trying
[41:15] to get our fingers wrapped around what
[41:16] the prophet brought
[41:19] and that's like the Apostle Paul the
[41:21] Apostle Paul now he's starting to talk
[41:23] to Gentiles and he's starting to tell
[41:26] Gentiles in the Gentile church that we
[41:28] are the Seed of Abraham we're Abraham's
[41:30] seed amen and now you talk about
[41:32] mind-blowing to Jews Jews are looking at
[41:35] natural lineage by a progression of
[41:37] Abraham who fathered this child father
[41:39] this child father that seed that's
[41:41] everything that they've known as seed
[41:42] amen but Paul now is all of a sudden
[41:45] he's going to strip that title away from
[41:47] the Jews amen and he's going to give it
[41:49] now to Gentiles who have no no no direct
[41:53] lineage they have no uh Blood of Abraham
[41:56] they have no genetic material of Abraham
[41:58] that they can trace inside of them and
[42:00] he's saying you're Abraham's seed how in
[42:02] the world are they Abraham's seed he
[42:04] said because the promise amen was not to
[42:06] Abraham in the flesh it was to it was to
[42:09] the spiritual real Abraham as the gene
[42:12] of God
[42:14] that's who that promise was too amen is
[42:17] there an effect on the flesh yes there's
[42:18] a promise also to the Natural Jews amen
[42:21] but the real promise that comes down to
[42:23] the reality is the real Abraham who was
[42:26] the Abraham on the inside and that can't
[42:28] be passed by a bloodline
[42:32] that's why he would come and call us the
[42:34] faith Seed of Abraham your Seed of
[42:36] Abraham if you have the faith of Abraham
[42:37] so if you have the same Faith Abraham
[42:40] had who's the father of us all then you
[42:43] are the Seed of Abraham why because
[42:45] you're come down through the lineage of
[42:47] Promise amen why see Gene see Gene
[42:50] lineage
[42:54] so now what makes me what what
[42:58] vindicates or confirms me to be Seed of
[43:01] Abraham because if I'm Seed of Abraham
[43:03] that means I get the promise of Abraham
[43:05] and the promise of Abraham is to inherit
[43:07] all the Earth
[43:09] and have God as my personal God
[43:13] so to get that promise I have to have
[43:16] something that confirms me a Seed of
[43:18] Abraham what confers me the Seed of
[43:20] Abraham is Faith genuine true faith
[43:24] faith in what faith in the word
[43:27] which is expressing the thought
[43:31] this is what Abraham had
[43:33] and so then Paul this is this is now
[43:36] listen we're not even talking about what
[43:38] brother Branham does with the word we're
[43:40] talking about the Apostle Paul
[43:42] you talk about you talk about
[43:44] theologians and Paul's days arguing with
[43:46] him over this statement
[43:49] right I think they had something to
[43:50] argue and then and then Paul does
[43:52] something else Paul takes circumcision
[43:54] which was the seal or Vindication or
[43:57] confirmation that you were part of this
[43:58] promise and he takes he takes their
[44:01] circumcision and he does away with it he
[44:03] says now it's the circumcision of the
[44:04] heart it's a new birth experience amen
[44:06] where the fleshly heart is cut away and
[44:09] all of a sudden their minds are blown
[44:10] because for hundreds and hundreds and
[44:12] thousands of years they've known that
[44:14] that the promise was to Abraham see
[44:16] they're thinking natural and the
[44:18] confirmation was a natural confirmation
[44:19] through circumcision and the Apostle
[44:21] Paul picks it up and he says the reality
[44:24] goes beyond the flesh the reality is
[44:27] spiritual
[44:31] this is why sometimes when people want
[44:33] to criticize amen those in the message
[44:35] of taking things through spiritual Paul
[44:37] was the one who stepped it up a notch to
[44:39] spiritual
[44:41] taking it from natural to spiritual
[44:45] and so then he comes and then he makes
[44:47] another step then he says now the
[44:50] promise was to Abraham's seed but not as
[44:53] many Not seeds as many he's not talking
[44:56] about a diverse lineage
[44:59] but to Abraham's seed as of one and that
[45:03] seed is Christ
[45:04] so now the Seed of Abraham is Christ
[45:08] the promise seed
[45:10] all right now it's completely Stripped
[45:13] Away from flesh it'll be expressed in
[45:15] flesh but it's completely Stripped Away
[45:17] from flesh now that seed is Christ and
[45:20] you are Abraham's seed if you have the
[45:22] faith of Abraham and if the Seed of
[45:24] Abraham is Christ and you're Abraham
[45:27] seed by faith then you must be also a
[45:29] part of what
[45:30] Christ
[45:34] who taught us this William Branham no
[45:36] the Apostle Paul brother Branham just
[45:38] reminded us of what Paul taught
[45:41] because here was a man with no
[45:43] theological training and a seventh grade
[45:45] education and I would venture to say his
[45:47] seventh grade education was not even the
[45:49] most robust of seventh grade educations
[45:53] and here he is taking us back to what
[45:57] Paul literally taught us
[46:02] amen
[46:05] and so now I'm going to continue reading
[46:07] here in Smyrna Church age
[46:12] Paul puts himself in all believers under
[46:14] this designation because he says Abraham
[46:16] who's the father of us all when he goes
[46:18] on not only to narrow down his
[46:20] definition but rather to finalize it for
[46:22] in Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[46:25] singular with Jesus and counted the seed
[46:27] children as children of promise and
[46:30] promised as having to do with election
[46:32] or the choosing of God
[46:34] and that is exactly what we have been
[46:36] saying these who are of the royal seed
[46:39] are the elect of God are the
[46:42] predestinated foreknown of God and we're
[46:44] in the mind of God and His Thoughts
[46:47] do you believe you're one of them
[46:49] that puts you in the original
[46:53] in very plain language the true bride of
[46:56] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[46:59] though not expressed until each came
[47:01] forth in the designated decreed season
[47:04] as each member came forth it became
[47:06] expressed and took its place in the body
[47:09] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[47:13] word seed bride
[47:15] and though she is feminine in
[47:16] designation she is also called the body
[47:19] of Christ it is very apparent that she
[47:22] ought to be called that for she was
[47:24] predestinated in him came from the same
[47:27] Source was eternal with him and is now
[47:30] manifesting God in a mini-membered body
[47:32] whereas once God was manifest in one
[47:35] member even our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:38] that was a mouthful
[47:41] I'm gonna go back and I'm going to
[47:43] repeat the last line so we don't miss it
[47:49] we
[47:50] the true bride of Christ
[47:53] was in the mind of Christ
[47:55] and the mind of God eternally
[47:59] but then there would come a time that we
[48:00] would be expressed in the decreed season
[48:03] the season that God wanted each
[48:05] attribute expressed
[48:08] and each member came forth
[48:12] and became expressed and took its place
[48:15] in the body
[48:17] right
[48:19] so thus the bride is literally the
[48:22] spoken word seed right
[48:27] the bride is literally
[48:29] the spoken word of God the seed of God
[48:33] coming to manifestation
[48:38] and though she's feminine in designation
[48:41] she's also called the body of Christ
[48:45] so what is this bride the body of Christ
[48:50] that's flesh body
[48:52] your flesh body
[48:54] the many membered body becomes the body
[48:57] of Christ or Christ dwelling in a
[49:00] many-membered body
[49:03] so it's Christ and flesh again
[49:08] I'm going to read this last line
[49:13] she's called the body of Christ it is
[49:14] very apparent that she ought to be
[49:16] called that
[49:17] for she was predestinated in him came
[49:20] from the same Source was eternal with
[49:23] him
[49:24] and is now manifesting God and in many
[49:27] many membered body whereas once God was
[49:30] manifesting one member even our Lord
[49:32] Jesus Christ
[49:34] my where did Brother bam just put you in
[49:38] your original form
[49:42] we've got to look past the natural
[49:45] and go beyond that back
[49:48] amen
[49:52] in Isaiah 55 brother remember Isaiah 55
[49:56] Isaiah says so shall my word be that
[49:58] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[50:00] return unto me void but it shall
[50:03] accomplish that which I please and it
[50:05] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[50:06] sent it
[50:08] God says my word shall not return unto
[50:10] me void when I send it out
[50:13] when I send it out it shall it shall
[50:16] accomplish that which I please and it
[50:18] shall prosper in a thing where to I sent
[50:20] it
[50:21] and the question is are you a word of
[50:23] God
[50:24] are you a sea Gene of God are you one of
[50:27] the thoughts of God going to be
[50:28] expressed in this earth if you are the
[50:30] word then God has already said my word
[50:33] will not return to me void amen but my
[50:36] word will accomplish that which I please
[50:39] amen and it will prosper and the thing
[50:42] where to I sent it so there's two things
[50:45] if you're a gene of God if you're part
[50:48] of the expressed thought of God as a
[50:50] word of God Amen then there's a
[50:52] guarantee in your life that when you
[50:55] return back to God because he said my
[50:57] word will return to me my word will not
[50:59] return to me avoid but it will
[51:02] accomplish my pleasure what I please so
[51:06] in your life amen if you just stay
[51:08] surrendered to God there's a promise in
[51:10] your life that you will accomplish what
[51:13] God pleases amen that word is not you're
[51:16] not going to go back to God void having
[51:18] not accomplished what he intended to
[51:20] accomplish with bringing his thought
[51:21] into expression in your flesh
[51:25] but then there's a second part of that
[51:29] and it shall prosper
[51:32] in the thing where to I sent it
[51:36] whatever God sent you to this earth to
[51:39] do you will prosper in doing that
[51:41] if God sent you to be an expression he
[51:44] sent you to be a part of the body of
[51:46] Christ in this day amen and nothing can
[51:48] stop that expression nothing can hinder
[51:50] it but that will that word in you will
[51:53] prosper in the thing God sent it to do
[51:57] amen it's not a uh if I could if I could
[52:00] just uh picture it this way it's not are
[52:03] you trying harder and pushing and
[52:05] straining and working no the word is
[52:07] already in you it's the original you
[52:09] it's the you you and it will accomplish
[52:11] what God pleases and it will return to
[52:13] God not void but having accomplished
[52:16] that which God thought before the
[52:17] foundation of the world
[52:19] it's going to happen amen it's not you
[52:22] the outside man it's not your will it's
[52:24] not your strength it's not your mind
[52:26] it's not your mind none of that is
[52:28] what's going to accomplish anything it's
[52:30] the thought being expressed in your soul
[52:33] amen that's manifesting that will
[52:35] accomplish what God pleases
[52:40] and it will prosper
[52:44] it will prosper in the thing where to I
[52:47] sent it amen whatever God has determined
[52:50] for us to express we will prosper in
[52:53] that expression
[52:54] it will work
[52:56] God's word is guaranteed his thought is
[52:58] guaranteed
[53:00] now in the message communion I read this
[53:02] Sunday brother bear says what was it
[53:04] there was another William Branham see a
[53:06] little spot of eternal life down there
[53:08] from the genes of God the word of God
[53:11] that was placed in there
[53:13] so brother man takes the gene of God and
[53:15] he makes it the word of God placed in
[53:17] your soul from before the foundation of
[53:18] the world and that word won't return
[53:20] back to God void but it will prosper
[53:23] amen
[53:25] and the Rapture message
[53:27] he says
[53:28] then how do we get into this body
[53:31] First Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we're
[53:33] all baptized into this body by one Holy
[53:35] Spirit baptism that if you want to put
[53:37] that down it's First Corinthians 12 13.
[53:41] and by one Spirit we're all baptizing
[53:43] and the spirit is the Life of Christ is
[53:46] that right the Life of Christ and the
[53:48] life of any seed which he was the word
[53:50] seed brings the seed to life
[53:53] you got it you get it if that life is
[53:57] laying in the seed where now we're
[53:59] talking about the seed in your soul if
[54:01] that life that eternal life that that
[54:03] that that was before uh predestinated to
[54:07] be you if that life is laying in the
[54:09] seed and this baptism of the Holy Spirit
[54:11] comes upon it it's bound to bring that
[54:14] Seed Life
[54:16] listen it didn't say bring that seed to
[54:19] life bring that Seed Life whatever that
[54:22] seed is that's the life that will come
[54:24] forth
[54:25] listen you cannot you cannot plant an
[54:28] apple seed and expect to get pears
[54:32] but the life of the seed will come forth
[54:34] you cannot plant a pear tree and expect
[54:37] to get apricots but whatever the life is
[54:38] in the seed that's what will come forth
[54:40] well what is the life in your seed and
[54:42] the Sea Gene of God it's the life of God
[54:45] it's Christ amen and it will come forth
[54:47] when Christ comes to that seed that life
[54:50] in that seed Will Spring forth and bring
[54:52] that Seed Life
[54:55] what is that life it's the Life of
[54:57] Christ
[54:58] amen
[55:00] he goes on to say in the message it is
[55:02] the rising of the sun said Don't Fear
[55:04] anymore for every four ordained
[55:06] predestinated seed of God shall come to
[55:08] life when the light spreads across the
[55:10] Earth of the Glorious gospel in every
[55:13] age it'll bring forth the crop that God
[55:15] ordained it to do
[55:17] in every age the light of that age will
[55:20] bring forth the crop that God ordained
[55:22] whatever seeds laying there when that
[55:24] light that is Manifest for that day hits
[55:27] that seed it'll spring to life
[55:33] he had raised from the dead I'm sorry
[55:36] let's read that again
[55:38] God shall come to life that seed of God
[55:40] shall come to life when the light
[55:41] spreads across the Earth of the Glorious
[55:43] gospel in every age it'll bring forth
[55:45] the crop that God ordained it to
[55:47] oh what a wonderful thing this is I am
[55:50] alive or quickened the word means the
[55:52] word quickened the Greek word means that
[55:54] something that's made alive after death
[55:56] like the seed that goes into the Earth
[55:59] it has to die every bit of the seed it
[56:01] has to rot every bit of the seed and
[56:04] every bit of the life that was in the
[56:06] seed has to come forth again
[56:09] this is nature amen declaring something
[56:12] spiritual
[56:14] that seed has to run amen when you talk
[56:17] about when we talk about our soul amen
[56:19] this is why brother Benham talks about
[56:21] he uses terminology like the seed in
[56:23] your soul or the sea gene or or the soul
[56:25] he uses them interchangeably but when we
[56:27] talk about the soul we're talking about
[56:29] the essence of Who You Are
[56:31] we're talking about your core you amen
[56:34] and you come into this life amen and the
[56:37] soul is having an expression it's the
[56:39] it's the nature that's controlling the
[56:41] spirit and the spirit's controlling the
[56:42] body amen but there comes a time when
[56:45] you recognize who you are and you
[56:47] recognize what God's calling to you and
[56:49] you have to die to self
[56:52] all of self has to die amen the down to
[56:56] the core you have to surrender you have
[56:58] to die you have to give up your thoughts
[57:00] your wishes your dreams your plans you
[57:02] have to give up all of self and as you
[57:05] lose all of self and let self rot and
[57:08] die amen down inside of self amen is a
[57:12] sea Gene of God
[57:14] a part of eternal life
[57:16] and when the light of God strikes that
[57:18] it begins to grow and take over
[57:22] and it brings the life of the seed now
[57:26] becomes the life on display
[57:30] but you have to surrender your life I
[57:33] have to surrender my life I have to die
[57:36] to myself
[57:40] amen
[57:43] let's go to John 3. let's go back here
[57:47] in John to John 3.
[57:56] John chapter 3 verse 5.
[58:00] Jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[58:02] thee accept a man be born of water in a
[58:04] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[58:06] of God
[58:07] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[58:10] and that which is born of the spirit is
[58:13] Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee
[58:15] ye must be born again
[58:18] see this is why we must be born again
[58:21] because our first birth is a birth in
[58:24] corruption
[58:25] and we come with a corrupted nature
[58:28] you believe that
[58:30] you've raised children right
[58:33] you come with a corrupt in nature amen
[58:35] but we have to die to ourselves we have
[58:37] to die to everything that we are amen
[58:39] and there has to be a new birth amen and
[58:42] that new birth is when the spirit of God
[58:44] contacts that life that's down on the
[58:46] inside of you and that quickens that or
[58:48] brings it from a dormant State and
[58:51] brings it into life and brings it into
[58:53] manifestation Amen in that little part
[58:55] of life brother Brandon tells us that
[58:57] was meant to be you from the beginning
[58:58] God intended that to be you amen you've
[59:01] got the original intent was for that
[59:03] life amen to be you and all of you and
[59:06] around that life would be encased a
[59:08] theophany and around that theophany
[59:09] would be encased flesh and it would all
[59:11] be perfect but it couldn't come that way
[59:13] because it came through sexual Birth by
[59:15] sex desire
[59:17] and so now you came corrupted amen but
[59:19] that seeking is still there the original
[59:21] you what God intended to be you it's
[59:23] waiting there it's waiting for something
[59:25] it's waiting to come in contact with its
[59:27] counterpart with something that's the
[59:29] same that is life has to come to life
[59:31] word has to come to word
[59:34] and but we have to be born again
[59:37] this is our new birth when that seed
[59:40] Springs to life but I want you to look
[59:42] at what he says in verse 6.
[59:45] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[59:50] and that which is born of the spirit is
[59:52] Spirit
[59:55] if you've been born again what kind of
[59:57] being are you
[59:59] are you a spirit being or a flesh being
[1:00:03] read it again
[1:00:05] which is born of the flesh is flesh and
[1:00:07] that which is born of the spirit is
[1:00:09] Spirit
[1:00:11] if you're born of the spirit your spirit
[1:00:14] what life should we be living from what
[1:00:17] realm should we be living in amen not
[1:00:20] the natural our first birth amen stuck
[1:00:22] Us in the natural but our new birth
[1:00:24] lifts us out of the natural into a
[1:00:26] spiritual Realm
[1:00:27] where we come back in contact with the
[1:00:30] Unseen World
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:34] that's why like we read last week that's
[1:00:36] why he goes on to say
[1:00:38] Marvel not that I say unto you must be
[1:00:39] born again the wind bloweth where it
[1:00:41] listeth and now here's the sound thereof
[1:00:43] but can't not tell when to cometh and
[1:00:45] whether it goes so is every man that is
[1:00:47] born in the spirit what's he talking
[1:00:48] about he's talking about the real you is
[1:00:51] bringing to life it's invisible to
[1:00:53] people amen they see it expressed
[1:00:55] through this amen but it's not just this
[1:00:57] amen it's the spirit as bro the birth
[1:01:00] Amen to the sieging of God and now he
[1:01:03] that's born of spirit is spirit and
[1:01:05] what's he like he's just like the wind
[1:01:07] amen and it lists his words one but no
[1:01:09] man knows where it came from no man
[1:01:10] knows where it's going you can see the
[1:01:12] effect of it and you want to see the
[1:01:14] effect of the sieging of God you can see
[1:01:16] the effect out here
[1:01:18] but it's invisible so now the intent is
[1:01:21] that this visible amen will begin to
[1:01:24] declare the invisible life on the inside
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] now let's go over to First Peter
[1:01:34] First Peter chapter one
[1:01:44] first Peter
[1:01:46] chapter one
[1:01:48] verse 23
[1:01:50] being born again not of corruptable seed
[1:01:54] what is the corruptable seed that was
[1:01:56] your natural birth
[1:01:59] but of Incorruptible what's
[1:02:01] Incorruptible seed
[1:02:03] the seeding of God and the seed word of
[1:02:06] God
[1:02:08] not born again of corruptible seed but
[1:02:10] of Incorruptible by the word of God
[1:02:12] which liveth and abideth forever
[1:02:15] amen praise God that's why we say it's a
[1:02:18] word birth when the word the life of the
[1:02:20] word comes and makes contact in you it
[1:02:22] brings to Life The Incorruptible seed
[1:02:24] that's the new birth
[1:02:26] amen that's why if you don't have an
[1:02:29] eternal seed Gene of God in your soul
[1:02:31] you can't come to the New Birth
[1:02:33] it's borne by an Incorruptible seed by
[1:02:36] the word of God Amen praise God
[1:02:39] now let's I'm going to look at something
[1:02:41] else for the next 15 minutes before we
[1:02:43] go let's go to Matthew 23 now
[1:02:47] I want to really get down to
[1:02:49] meat and potatoes
[1:02:53] we went from the real real all the way
[1:02:56] back and invisible now we're going to
[1:02:57] come all the way down to what we're
[1:02:59] going to do in the morning when we wake
[1:03:01] up
[1:03:03] Matthew 23 25.
[1:03:09] Matthew 23 25 says woe unto you scribes
[1:03:13] and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make
[1:03:15] clean the outside of the cup of the
[1:03:16] platter but within they are full of
[1:03:18] extortion and excess
[1:03:20] Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that
[1:03:23] which is within the cup and platter that
[1:03:25] the outside of them may be clean also
[1:03:27] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[1:03:29] Hypocrites for you are like unto Whited
[1:03:31] sepulch which indeed appear beautiful
[1:03:33] outward but are within full of dead
[1:03:35] men's bones and of all uncleanness even
[1:03:38] so you also outwardly appear righteous
[1:03:41] unto men but within you are full of
[1:03:43] hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:03:46] I I am glad I was not one of them
[1:03:49] standing there that day because that's
[1:03:50] not a very nice thing to hear
[1:03:53] but he's declaring their actual
[1:03:55] condition you're he's saying you're
[1:03:57] working so hard to make the outside of
[1:03:59] you righteous he said but stop first you
[1:04:02] have to cleanse the inside amen not the
[1:04:04] outside but take care of the inside and
[1:04:07] what's on the inside will declare itself
[1:04:09] on the outside
[1:04:10] here they're making a declaration but
[1:04:12] Jesus makes another declaration they're
[1:04:14] declaring by their Works they're
[1:04:16] declaring by their dress they're
[1:04:17] declaring by everything that they are
[1:04:19] righteous and they are holy but Jesus
[1:04:21] Christ makes another declaration he
[1:04:23] declares that inside you're full of
[1:04:25] death amen full of dead men's bones
[1:04:28] you're like a Whited Sepulcher a grave
[1:04:30] that's painted pure on the outside but
[1:04:32] inside it's dead there's nothing there
[1:04:34] you don't have the goods you're trying
[1:04:36] to show that you do but you don't have
[1:04:38] it inside
[1:04:39] that's what he's saying what's he saying
[1:04:41] verse first take care of the inside and
[1:04:43] what's inside will declare on the
[1:04:45] outside
[1:04:47] and things that are to be he says that's
[1:04:50] the way this old body is it bore the
[1:04:52] image of the heavenly
[1:04:54] it's not you you are on the inside of
[1:04:57] that body
[1:04:58] so that's why they could decorate the
[1:05:00] body any way they want but that wasn't
[1:05:02] the reality the reality is what they
[1:05:04] were in the soul
[1:05:06] that was the reality
[1:05:08] the same thing is true today we can
[1:05:09] decorate the outside any way we want but
[1:05:12] the reality is the invisible
[1:05:15] what's in the soul
[1:05:18] you are on the inside of that body you
[1:05:21] the spirit of God is on the inside of
[1:05:23] that body
[1:05:24] that's what makes the outside come into
[1:05:26] subjection because the inside is pulling
[1:05:29] it see bringing it in line with the word
[1:05:31] of God you're inside you yourself your
[1:05:34] being
[1:05:35] so Brother Band is not making this
[1:05:37] outside you
[1:05:38] listen this outside is temporarily you
[1:05:42] I said this outside was given to you as
[1:05:46] a way for what's in you to express
[1:05:48] itself
[1:05:50] oh I hope you get that clear
[1:05:52] this outside is a way for the world to
[1:05:55] see what's in you
[1:05:58] this is why brother Graham teaches what
[1:06:00] he teaches on on faith and works amen he
[1:06:02] begins to teach us that faith is what
[1:06:05] God recognizes because God doesn't look
[1:06:07] to the outside God looks to the heart
[1:06:09] is that right God cares about the
[1:06:11] condition of the heart amen and we're
[1:06:13] declared righteous by faith if we have
[1:06:15] the faith of Abraham we're to we're
[1:06:17] declared righteous imputed righteousness
[1:06:19] just like Abraham had
[1:06:21] God's looking to the inside but brother
[1:06:23] Branham says but but man looks to the
[1:06:26] outside that's why works is Faith
[1:06:29] expressed the expression of the faith
[1:06:31] you have in your heart is what comes out
[1:06:33] on the outside and that expresses to the
[1:06:36] world the life that's inside
[1:06:38] that's why you can't separate these two
[1:06:40] and say well we just have faith so it
[1:06:42] doesn't matter what I do what do you
[1:06:43] mean it doesn't matter what you do what
[1:06:45] you do is an expression of what you
[1:06:47] believe don't ever kid yourself about
[1:06:49] that and don't ever try to make yourself
[1:06:51] say well I believe the message amen but
[1:06:53] I just can't live it no if you believe
[1:06:55] the message you stay there and ask God
[1:06:57] to change you until it lives itself in
[1:07:00] you
[1:07:01] the reality is none of us can live it
[1:07:03] none of us have been able to live it we
[1:07:05] were born in hybrid flesh with Twisted
[1:07:07] minds and twisted desires and
[1:07:09] animalistic sex drive and all of these
[1:07:11] things there's not a one of us can live
[1:07:12] it but if you're a child of God Amen
[1:07:15] there's a gene on the inside of you that
[1:07:16] if it Springs the Life by the baptism of
[1:07:19] the Holy Ghost it can live the word
[1:07:21] because it is the word
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:24] amen so don't don't let anybody play
[1:07:27] Funny Business about it doesn't matter
[1:07:29] what you do and I can do this and I can
[1:07:31] do that amen what you do declares what's
[1:07:34] inside of you
[1:07:40] is gone
[1:07:41] and you're inside you yourself your
[1:07:44] being is what you are deep inside
[1:07:48] that's the reality
[1:07:51] the reality
[1:07:54] is in you and what's in you word
[1:07:57] what was that word originally a thought
[1:08:01] but the thought expressed as a word
[1:08:04] now that word has to come into
[1:08:05] manifestation and where will that come
[1:08:08] word come into manifestation it'll
[1:08:10] manifest in flesh
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:17] praise God
[1:08:19] let's go to Matthew chapter seven let's
[1:08:22] go our 15 sorry Matthew chapter 15. go
[1:08:25] back just a few pages
[1:08:27] Matthew chapter 15.
[1:08:30] verse 7.
[1:08:34] ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah's prophesy
[1:08:37] of you saying this people draw nine to
[1:08:38] me with their mouth and honor me with
[1:08:40] their lips but their heart is far from
[1:08:42] me
[1:08:43] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[1:08:46] doctrines for the Commandments of men
[1:08:49] now all of a sudden they had they had
[1:08:51] worked on all the outside and all the
[1:08:53] picture getting all the pictures right
[1:08:54] trying to declare something that they
[1:08:56] really weren't and God cut through all
[1:08:58] of it and got down to the reality
[1:09:01] and we're going to look at how he does
[1:09:03] that here in just a minute
[1:09:05] but in the message Shalom the prophet
[1:09:08] says like in the physical body as we are
[1:09:10] now we are separated from one another
[1:09:13] but it's really this body is only
[1:09:17] is the only thing that identifies us to
[1:09:19] each other
[1:09:20] because we are bound in five senses see
[1:09:23] taste feel smell in here and as long as
[1:09:25] we can see or feel one another why we
[1:09:27] have evidence that we're here if you're
[1:09:29] blind and can't see then you can feel
[1:09:31] one another you hear one another and the
[1:09:33] Earthly senses declare one another
[1:09:36] but really frankly we have never seen
[1:09:38] each other
[1:09:39] did you know that we have never seen one
[1:09:42] another you hear something speaking out
[1:09:44] of a body here that impersonates
[1:09:46] whatever it's on the inside
[1:09:49] that's the reality
[1:09:51] amen
[1:09:53] praise God
[1:09:54] so that's why I can say this this body
[1:09:58] amen is here to declare me and to
[1:10:01] express me amen and I want it to express
[1:10:04] the right life
[1:10:06] the reality of what's in my soul not the
[1:10:09] influences of other Spirits not the
[1:10:10] influences of people around me not the
[1:10:12] influence of culture amen but I want to
[1:10:14] stay tied into God so that this thing is
[1:10:17] influenced by the Holy Ghost influenced
[1:10:19] by the word and begins to express what's
[1:10:21] deep down inside of me
[1:10:24] and I want to impersonate what's on the
[1:10:26] inside of me
[1:10:28] which I believe is God
[1:10:30] so this flesh needs to impersonate
[1:10:33] what's inside
[1:10:36] and so we've really never seen one
[1:10:39] another
[1:10:40] we've really never touched one another
[1:10:42] but then you say this is my body it is
[1:10:45] your body
[1:10:46] that's true
[1:10:48] is this your body yes is this the little
[1:10:50] tip of my finger what is that that's
[1:10:51] Chad amen this fingernail that's Chad
[1:10:53] this is all this is Chad but this is
[1:10:55] Chad's body
[1:10:58] this is not all of me the real me is
[1:11:01] down inside this is only me because I'm
[1:11:04] in it
[1:11:06] does that make sense
[1:11:08] so so it this is this is me not because
[1:11:13] this is me this is me because me is in
[1:11:16] it
[1:11:17] making this my body making this body
[1:11:20] Chad but the real Chad if that's even
[1:11:23] really my name
[1:11:24] is deep down on the inside
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:29] praise God
[1:11:30] oh of that reality could just drive down
[1:11:33] it'll change so many things amen this
[1:11:35] way when this body feels something I
[1:11:37] don't care that's not me when there's
[1:11:38] pain when there's heartbreak when when
[1:11:40] there's discomfort when there's
[1:11:41] embarrassment so what this isn't me I'm
[1:11:44] on the inside of this
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:49] so if you think something bad about this
[1:11:52] expression then that's fine amen it's
[1:11:55] just a clump of dirt anyways amen but
[1:11:57] the real me is down inside
[1:12:01] and then brother Brahm says in the
[1:12:03] message hidden life in Christ
[1:12:05] says see you're coming up to a place now
[1:12:07] you realize there's a hidden place in
[1:12:09] Christ where you can be hid that all of
[1:12:11] your enemies you'll love them
[1:12:13] there's something about it that you want
[1:12:15] people to love you you want to be lovely
[1:12:18] and if you want people to be lovely you
[1:12:20] have to be lovely yourself
[1:12:22] and you can't you you can't put it on it
[1:12:26] just won't work it won't they know it
[1:12:28] you can't put anything on Don't Make
[1:12:30] Believe
[1:12:32] that's what's the matter with our
[1:12:33] country today there's too much
[1:12:35] make-believe in just religious works
[1:12:37] there's too many people making believe
[1:12:39] trying to impersonate Christianity
[1:12:41] trying to do something to act like
[1:12:43] Christians that won't work friend
[1:12:46] God knows that the devil knows it and
[1:12:49] the people knows it
[1:12:50] you've got to be genuine you've got to
[1:12:53] be original God will honor it
[1:12:56] so what does God want he wants an
[1:12:59] original you he wants whatever is
[1:13:01] expressed on the outside to be the
[1:13:03] reality coming from your heart not a
[1:13:05] religious workup that's coming from the
[1:13:07] outside amen but he wants the reality
[1:13:09] from our hearts
[1:13:11] that's what's accepting
[1:13:13] now let's go to John the Gospel of John
[1:13:15] John chapter 8.
[1:13:18] and I think we're going to wrap it up
[1:13:19] here
[1:13:21] and John
[1:13:26] John chapter 8 verse 37.
[1:13:36] Jesus says in verse 37 I know that you
[1:13:39] were Abraham's seed
[1:13:41] so he identifies them they called
[1:13:42] themselves children of Abraham and he
[1:13:44] says I know that you're Abraham's seed
[1:13:46] now he's speaking on the level of Flesh
[1:13:49] okay
[1:13:50] I know that you're Abraham's seed but
[1:13:53] you seek to kill me because my word hath
[1:13:55] no place in you
[1:13:56] I speak that which I have seen with my
[1:13:58] father and you do that which you have
[1:14:00] seen with your father
[1:14:02] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[1:14:04] is our father Jesus said unto them if ye
[1:14:07] were Abraham's children you would do the
[1:14:09] works of Abraham now he said I know your
[1:14:12] Abraham seed
[1:14:14] that's natural
[1:14:16] he's not even denying that you come
[1:14:18] genetically down that line but now he's
[1:14:21] saying if you were Abraham's children
[1:14:23] you would do the works of Abraham but
[1:14:26] now you seek to kill me a man that had
[1:14:28] told you the truth which I have heard of
[1:14:30] God this did not Abraham
[1:14:33] you do the Deeds of your father then
[1:14:35] said they to him we be not born of
[1:14:37] fornication see they knew what serpency
[1:14:39] was all about
[1:14:41] we be not born of fornication we have
[1:14:43] one father even gone Jesus said unto
[1:14:45] them if God were your father now he's
[1:14:48] going Beyond Abraham
[1:14:50] if God were your father you would love
[1:14:53] me for I proceeded forth and came from
[1:14:55] God neither came I of myself but he sent
[1:14:58] me
[1:14:59] why do you not understand my speech even
[1:15:01] because you cannot hear my word year of
[1:15:05] your father the devil and the lust of
[1:15:06] your father you will do
[1:15:08] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:15:10] Abode not in the truth because there is
[1:15:12] no truth in him when he speak of the LIE
[1:15:15] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[1:15:17] and the father of it and because I tell
[1:15:19] you the truth you believe me not
[1:15:22] Jesus now you know he's dealing with the
[1:15:25] Pharisees he's dealing with the
[1:15:27] religious of the day but now he's going
[1:15:29] down into the heart of the matter and
[1:15:31] he's beginning to expose they think
[1:15:33] they're Abraham's seed they think
[1:15:35] they're the Oracles of God they think
[1:15:37] they have it all put together and
[1:15:38] they've got all the law and all the
[1:15:40] traditions and everything all packed
[1:15:42] around they are religious and they're
[1:15:43] only living it outward there's nothing
[1:15:45] on the inside and Jesus is about to
[1:15:47] expose it and he's exposing it how he's
[1:15:50] showing you're not Abraham's seed and
[1:15:52] God is not your father
[1:15:55] they were claiming that but how is Jesus
[1:15:58] able to make such a statement well one
[1:16:00] is because he's Jesus but he's going to
[1:16:01] show him the evidence that he has and
[1:16:03] Evans exhibit a amen is you don't
[1:16:06] believe the word
[1:16:09] you can't I come from the father and you
[1:16:11] hate me you don't love me if you were of
[1:16:13] God you would love me because I
[1:16:15] proceeded forth from God Amen what
[1:16:17] proceeded forth from God the word the
[1:16:20] word proceeded forth from God Amen and
[1:16:23] if you love God if you're of God you
[1:16:25] will love the word if you are the word
[1:16:27] you will love the word if you proceeded
[1:16:29] from God you will love that which
[1:16:30] proceeded from God this is why John
[1:16:33] would come and say how can you hate your
[1:16:35] brother and say you love God who if you
[1:16:37] say you love God you've not seen and you
[1:16:39] can't love your brother who you can see
[1:16:40] why because if he's genuinely your
[1:16:43] brother he proceeded from God how can
[1:16:46] you hate that which come from God which
[1:16:48] is word
[1:16:51] if your word you can't hate the word
[1:16:55] if your word a child of God an attribute
[1:16:58] a seed Gene a part of eternal life then
[1:17:01] you have to love everything that comes
[1:17:04] from God all the word all the gene of
[1:17:06] God
[1:17:10] oh praise God
[1:17:15] so now he begins to strip away all the
[1:17:19] religion
[1:17:21] just tearing it down
[1:17:23] it doesn't mean anything in me inside
[1:17:25] you're full of dead men's bones
[1:17:27] If Abraham was your father but he's
[1:17:30] saying now he's saying Abraham is not
[1:17:32] your father but now he's saying your
[1:17:33] father is the devil
[1:17:36] how can he go from Abraham's not your
[1:17:37] father to your father's the devil he
[1:17:39] says because you seek to kill me
[1:17:43] why because the devil hates the word
[1:17:48] and the devil tries to destroy the word
[1:17:50] so if there's a spirit inside anyone who
[1:17:54] tries to destroy the word amen that's
[1:17:56] the devil amen the origin is the devil
[1:18:01] Jesus made it so simple right here
[1:18:04] amen I'm not talking about somebody who
[1:18:07] doesn't understand the word I'm not
[1:18:08] talking to somebody who doesn't see it
[1:18:10] there's lots of people who are not
[1:18:12] predestinated they can't see it amen but
[1:18:14] they don't hate it
[1:18:16] they don't fight it they don't try to
[1:18:18] destroy it they just say I don't
[1:18:19] understand it amen God will deal with
[1:18:22] them and there can even be a reward for
[1:18:24] somebody like that if they're able to
[1:18:25] honor the word in whatever fashion they
[1:18:27] can find it in
[1:18:29] or receive it in that's not what I'm
[1:18:31] talking about but Jesus come to people
[1:18:34] who were trying to destroy the
[1:18:35] manifested word trying to destroy the
[1:18:37] Son of God trying to destroy attributes
[1:18:40] of God and he says your father is the
[1:18:43] devil if God were your father you would
[1:18:45] love me because I proceeded and came
[1:18:46] forth from him
[1:18:51] amen
[1:18:52] that means if we proceeded forth from
[1:18:55] God
[1:18:56] everything that proceeds forth from God
[1:18:58] we love
[1:19:02] and you wonder why you love this message
[1:19:04] so much
[1:19:06] why do you love the message so much
[1:19:08] because the message is the word of God
[1:19:11] the message proceeded forth from God
[1:19:17] it was a thought in God's mind
[1:19:19] it was a secret in the back part of
[1:19:21] God's mind
[1:19:22] and it came forth as word amen and now
[1:19:26] that word is coming into manifestation
[1:19:28] and bride form amen and how could you
[1:19:30] not love it you have to love it if you
[1:19:33] came from God of God where your father
[1:19:34] you would love everything that proceeds
[1:19:37] forth from God
[1:19:40] this is why you know when people claim
[1:19:44] to believe the message
[1:19:46] but they don't receive what prophet
[1:19:48] taught
[1:19:51] they brother men will clearly teach
[1:19:53] things and he'll explain it he'll tell
[1:19:55] why it's got to be this way and people
[1:19:57] throw it away whether it's a marriage
[1:19:58] and divorce whether it's ministers must
[1:20:00] marry a virgin or whatever Prophet
[1:20:02] they'll throw it away and say I love the
[1:20:04] message but my goodness who do you think
[1:20:06] this was who do you think was preaching
[1:20:10] where did he get it from I mean what
[1:20:12] what is being taught what is being
[1:20:14] priests amen I want to throw this away
[1:20:16] and throw that away amen we don't even
[1:20:18] understand you find yourself fighting
[1:20:21] against the word of God the very nature
[1:20:23] of God Amen the word on display why and
[1:20:26] we claim to believe it we claim to love
[1:20:28] it we claim to love the message but but
[1:20:30] somehow we don't we don't like the way
[1:20:32] he taught about women's dress we don't
[1:20:35] like the way he talked about gender
[1:20:37] roles we don't like those things how
[1:20:39] could you not like those things that
[1:20:40] came from the messenger that came from
[1:20:42] God
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:20:45] amen amen so we have to check ourselves
[1:20:48] and say am I here by religious order or
[1:20:51] am I here because my heart is engaged
[1:20:53] with the word
[1:20:54] because if you're here by religious
[1:20:56] order amen you can you can make the
[1:20:59] gospel of none effect teaching for
[1:21:00] Doctrine the traditions of man
[1:21:02] and that could creep back into the
[1:21:04] message because they begin to teach
[1:21:06] Traditions that made them more religious
[1:21:08] and they had workarounds for the word of
[1:21:10] God
[1:21:11] you realize that Jesus Jesus even begins
[1:21:15] to scold them because the word of God
[1:21:16] says honor your father and mother but
[1:21:18] you say if I take what I'm supposed to
[1:21:20] support you with and I give it to the
[1:21:22] treasury then I'm more blessed and they
[1:21:23] had a whole tradition to work around the
[1:21:26] Commandment of God
[1:21:28] is that right
[1:21:30] oh do you think that Spirit died in that
[1:21:33] day
[1:21:37] a spirit's still alive
[1:21:40] and I'm not even supposed to be
[1:21:41] preaching this right now there's
[1:21:42] something else I want to say
[1:21:46] but there's a reason
[1:21:49] there's a reason
[1:21:51] Jesus says
[1:21:53] if you if you
[1:21:55] if your father was God you would love me
[1:21:59] for our proceeded force from God
[1:22:03] say we love this message but I don't
[1:22:05] love this part
[1:22:06] and I don't love this part and I'm going
[1:22:09] to take some man's tradition
[1:22:11] mix it in and I'll find a church that
[1:22:14] suits my day I say let's go back to
[1:22:16] square one
[1:22:18] let's strip all of that down and say God
[1:22:20] you have got to change me and make me
[1:22:22] match your word you've got to Quicken
[1:22:24] something to me that will love all of
[1:22:26] the word all of the message amen
[1:22:28] whatever this Prophet taught amen
[1:22:30] there's a reason that it was taught and
[1:22:31] there's a reason you let it stand and
[1:22:33] there's a reason you Vindicated it
[1:22:35] there's a reason behind it there's a
[1:22:37] purpose behind it I'm not here to cut it
[1:22:40] in or cut it out I'm just here to say
[1:22:41] God that was you amen you've indicated
[1:22:44] you backed it up you didn't let any of
[1:22:46] his words fall to the ground how am I
[1:22:48] going to cut and dice and slice and
[1:22:49] remove
[1:22:51] D but I'm going to say God this
[1:22:52] proceeded forth from you and I'm
[1:22:54] accepting it and receiving it and if we
[1:22:56] can't do that we need to get back down
[1:22:58] on our knees and say God you've got to
[1:23:00] awaken a c Gene inside of me that'll
[1:23:02] love all of your word
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:06] praise be to God
[1:23:09] praise be to God
[1:23:11] brother remember says in time tested
[1:23:13] memories of God he said you see a man's
[1:23:15] character is made known by his works
[1:23:18] whatever you are your Works prove what
[1:23:20] you are
[1:23:22] no matter how much you testify whatever
[1:23:24] you say Pro or con that has nothing to
[1:23:26] do with it your Works tell what you are
[1:23:28] tell us what you are inside
[1:23:32] we begin to manipulate by our own
[1:23:34] thinking the word it's beginning to tell
[1:23:36] a story
[1:23:37] we need to come back and say God
[1:23:40] I want to surrender more of myself
[1:23:43] I want to die more so that word can live
[1:23:45] more
[1:23:49] I want to read one more scripture
[1:23:50] together out of Romans chapter 10.
[1:24:07] Romans chapter 10.
[1:24:09] verse 8.
[1:24:11] but what says that the word is 90 even
[1:24:14] in thy mouth and in thy heart that is
[1:24:17] the word of faith which we preach
[1:24:19] that if Thou shalt confess with thy
[1:24:21] mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
[1:24:22] in thine heart that God hath raised him
[1:24:24] from the dead Thou shalt be saved
[1:24:27] for with the heart man believeth unto
[1:24:28] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:24:30] confession is made into salvation
[1:24:33] the Apostle Paul never makes salvation
[1:24:35] based on just your heart or just your
[1:24:38] confession
[1:24:40] but he takes the outward and the n-word
[1:24:43] and he makes them both together the same
[1:24:48] we cannot be saved just by what goes on
[1:24:51] on the inside with no outside expression
[1:24:54] whatsoever
[1:24:56] neither can we only have an outside
[1:24:57] expression with nothing inside but when
[1:24:59] the inside and the outside line up then
[1:25:02] we're talking salvation
[1:25:08] well the REM said in Elijah in the meal
[1:25:10] offering said oh there it was and when
[1:25:12] they walked into the fiery furnace under
[1:25:14] trial under a test
[1:25:16] they held true to the end but God was
[1:25:18] there just in a spare of a moment and he
[1:25:21] delivered them they know that they were
[1:25:22] prayed up their sins were confessed they
[1:25:25] know they'd met every requirement and
[1:25:27] yet he seemed to be silent
[1:25:29] he's only silent to test you
[1:25:32] to see really what you are what's on the
[1:25:35] inside of you see if you really mean
[1:25:37] from your heart what you're saying with
[1:25:39] your lips let that go deep we can say
[1:25:42] with our lips but is our heart saying it
[1:25:46] we say we love the message but is our
[1:25:48] heart saying it and if our heart's
[1:25:50] saying it is our life saying it
[1:25:53] they have to match
[1:25:55] you can't be disjointed
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:02] brother member says and message
[1:26:04] influence
[1:26:06] the life that you live proves what's on
[1:26:08] the inside of you you cannot change that
[1:26:09] it reflects every person reflects
[1:26:12] outside what he is inside
[1:26:15] when Jesus came
[1:26:18] to Earth
[1:26:20] Jesus was was constrained
[1:26:24] by something
[1:26:26] and that something that constrained him
[1:26:27] was the will of God
[1:26:30] Jesus he had a human life
[1:26:33] he could make choices he can make
[1:26:36] decisions he could take actions is that
[1:26:38] right
[1:26:39] but there was something that constrained
[1:26:41] him
[1:26:42] and the thing that constrained him was
[1:26:44] the will of his father
[1:26:46] and he says in John 5 19 then answered
[1:26:48] Jesus and said unto them verily verily I
[1:26:50] say unto you the son can do nothing of
[1:26:52] himself but what he seeth the father do
[1:26:55] for what things so ever he doeth these
[1:26:57] also doeth the son likewise
[1:27:00] this is where brother Ben takes the
[1:27:01] scripture and says Jesus only did that
[1:27:03] which the father showed him he was led
[1:27:05] by Vision he didn't use his own desires
[1:27:08] he didn't use his own reactions amen but
[1:27:10] Jesus was constrained in what
[1:27:12] constrained him was the will of God and
[1:27:14] we know the will of God the word of God
[1:27:16] is the will of God
[1:27:19] now we come down to the Permian Church
[1:27:21] days because now I want to come down to
[1:27:22] you and I
[1:27:24] said notice the harmony of the father
[1:27:26] and the son Jesus never did anything
[1:27:28] until it was first showed him by the
[1:27:29] Father John 5 19.
[1:27:32] this harmony is now to exist between the
[1:27:34] groom and his bride he shows her his
[1:27:37] Word of Life she receives it she never
[1:27:40] doubts it
[1:27:42] well what are we to do we are to do the
[1:27:45] same thing Jesus did in Jesus being
[1:27:47] constrained by the will of the father
[1:27:49] made him the expression of the father
[1:27:53] is that right
[1:27:55] let's let's run that again
[1:27:57] the the father expressed his word amen
[1:28:01] and as it come out from the father it
[1:28:03] was a son he took that expression of
[1:28:05] himself and he made a body of Flesh and
[1:28:07] he stepped he put the word his
[1:28:09] expression of himself into bodily form
[1:28:12] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:28:14] Us the fullness of the godhead was
[1:28:15] bodily amen and in that bodily form
[1:28:18] Jesus was constrained by the will of the
[1:28:21] father and only did that which the
[1:28:23] father showed him in doing so he he was
[1:28:26] an exact expression
[1:28:29] of the thought of God
[1:28:32] all right do we understand what I'm
[1:28:34] saying
[1:28:35] God's thought expressed because he
[1:28:38] didn't take any other thought only what
[1:28:40] the father showed him
[1:28:44] and then pick up your pen and write the
[1:28:46] angel tells brother Branham he's writing
[1:28:49] this harmony is now to exist between
[1:28:52] Christ and his bride
[1:28:55] he shows her his Word of Life how did he
[1:28:57] show us the word of life he did it
[1:28:59] through a prophet in the end time He
[1:29:00] restored the word
[1:29:03] he shows us his Word of Life she
[1:29:05] receives it she never doubts it
[1:29:08] and she doesn't just receive it she acts
[1:29:10] upon it
[1:29:11] she's constrained what is the bride
[1:29:14] constrained by she's constrained by the
[1:29:16] will of her husband
[1:29:19] so that she doesn't take her own will
[1:29:21] her own thoughts her own desires but now
[1:29:23] there's There's a constraint upon her
[1:29:25] and she has to have the same Harmony
[1:29:27] between her and her headship her and the
[1:29:30] bridegroom her and her husband Jesus
[1:29:32] Christ as Christ had with the father and
[1:29:34] that what constrains us now is the word
[1:29:37] that has been given to us
[1:29:39] and we receive it we never doubt it
[1:29:43] that's why
[1:29:45] listen to these last two quotes now
[1:29:48] an Easter seal 1965 he says this
[1:29:51] Messianic anointed one believes that
[1:29:53] what is the Messiah what is the messiah
[1:29:56] messiah is the anointed one
[1:29:58] and now if he was the Messiah by being
[1:30:00] the anointed one for that day to fulfill
[1:30:02] the word of God to be the Redeemer and
[1:30:05] the anointed one and God raised up that
[1:30:07] body his bride is the anointed one for
[1:30:11] this day
[1:30:12] he was the anointed one for that day now
[1:30:15] his bride is the anointed one for this
[1:30:17] day she's anointed to do what she's
[1:30:19] anointed to manifest the word
[1:30:21] and she's constrained by the word
[1:30:25] amen
[1:30:27] he says an invisible Union of the bride
[1:30:28] of Christ and Jesus the word took my
[1:30:31] place
[1:30:32] he become me that a sinner that I might
[1:30:34] become him the word
[1:30:36] Amen Let Me Hold true to it not the
[1:30:39] church the word
[1:30:41] oh the spiritual union of Christ and his
[1:30:44] church now when the flesh is becoming
[1:30:47] word and the word is becoming flesh
[1:30:50] manifested Vindicated
[1:30:54] oh praise God what day are we living in
[1:30:56] we're living in the day where that word
[1:30:58] that was promised for day is becoming
[1:31:00] flesh
[1:31:01] where is that word coming into
[1:31:03] manifestation it's coming to
[1:31:05] manifestation in his bride how because
[1:31:07] she's constrained by the word and does
[1:31:10] only that which your husband wants her
[1:31:12] to do if he said this is the way it is
[1:31:14] she says praise God that's all I want
[1:31:16] let it be that way in me
[1:31:20] let's all stand
[1:31:24] are we in the day of the invisible Union
[1:31:29] where will that invisible Union
[1:31:31] where will it be expressed
[1:31:34] it's invisible
[1:31:36] remember the title of the service
[1:31:37] tonight
[1:31:39] the visible declaring the invisible
[1:31:43] there's an invisible Union do you
[1:31:45] believe you're part of that invisible
[1:31:46] Union then the visible part of you is
[1:31:49] predestined to declare that Union
[1:31:52] and that Union is between a bride and
[1:31:55] her bridegroom between a woman and her
[1:31:57] husband the headship and she now is here
[1:32:00] to be the submissive wife to give
[1:32:02] constraint to her own thinking her own
[1:32:04] desire her own will and give herself
[1:32:06] over to the will of Christ
[1:32:10] and in doing that
[1:32:12] we are the anointed one for this day
[1:32:15] the word
[1:32:17] made
[1:32:18] flesh
[1:32:20] where is it made flesh oh God let it be
[1:32:22] made flesh right here
[1:32:24] oh God help me with a pure heart to
[1:32:28] surrender completely to your word
[1:32:30] help me to give up my will help me to
[1:32:32] give them all myself and everything else
[1:32:34] and let me lay it down amen and let me
[1:32:37] take that word upon myself and live it
[1:32:39] God come and live it through me
[1:32:42] let me surrender when we die to ourself
[1:32:46] and take the word we let the word live
[1:32:48] instead of us
[1:32:51] when we have a desire
[1:32:53] when we have a thought and all of a
[1:32:55] sudden the word checks that thought
[1:32:57] we have a plan a desire I'd like to do
[1:33:00] this I'd like to do that but all of a
[1:33:01] sudden we hear the brother Branham say
[1:33:03] we read in the Bible we hear somebody
[1:33:05] preach and all of a sudden this word
[1:33:06] checks this thought when we die to self
[1:33:09] we let the word live
[1:33:13] how do I manifest the word it's easy die
[1:33:16] to yourself surrender to the word and
[1:33:18] you'll manifest the word
[1:33:19] in every form of life when the word amen
[1:33:22] is a contradictory to self let self die
[1:33:25] the word will take its place and now
[1:33:27] it's not you living now it's Christ
[1:33:29] Living
[1:33:31] but every time we come and come back
[1:33:34] head to head with something the prophet
[1:33:36] taught us something the Bible says and
[1:33:38] all of a sudden amen through the
[1:33:39] traditions of manner through some
[1:33:41] reasoning we we take the word and lay
[1:33:43] the word to the side and take our own
[1:33:44] ideas we're now expressing self not the
[1:33:47] word and now this is not the word made
[1:33:49] flesh
[1:33:52] we're not in the purpose of God we're
[1:33:54] not accomplishing what God sent his word
[1:33:56] for
[1:33:58] I say God help me whenever it comes head
[1:34:01] to head with the word help me die
[1:34:02] quickly when I find out I've been wrong
[1:34:05] maybe I've been doing something wrong
[1:34:06] I've been doing it wrong for years I was
[1:34:08] ignorant I didn't know but all of a
[1:34:09] sudden God brings the word on the scene
[1:34:11] let me quickly say I die to myself so
[1:34:13] the word can take its place and now I
[1:34:16] can become more of the word made flesh
[1:34:19] that's the age that we're living in how
[1:34:22] are we going to do it how's the bride go
[1:34:24] up word by word
[1:34:26] how do you surrender word by word
[1:34:29] decision by decision day by day amen it
[1:34:32] wasn't one time at the altar it's all
[1:34:34] over now no it's every day I'm
[1:34:36] surrendering a little more every day I'm
[1:34:38] putting myself lower my desires my will
[1:34:40] my wants and I'm taking the word and
[1:34:43] letting the word be my my life letting
[1:34:46] the word be my decision what's your
[1:34:48] decision whatever the word says that's
[1:34:49] my decision what will you do whatever
[1:34:51] the word says that's what I do and
[1:34:53] that's how the word is made flesh
[1:34:56] sometimes we make things too mystical
[1:35:00] where the the word is becoming flesh and
[1:35:03] the flesh is becoming the word you can
[1:35:04] say it's so mystical but there's no
[1:35:07] practical application you go back out
[1:35:08] and keep doing the same things we always
[1:35:10] did manifesting the same life it becomes
[1:35:12] so mystical now where there were the
[1:35:14] brides the word made flesh she will be
[1:35:16] the anointed one for this day if you
[1:35:17] keep it in the mystical Realms you'll
[1:35:19] keep living the same way we've always
[1:35:21] lived
[1:35:23] but when we bring it down to the
[1:35:24] practicality and say you know what every
[1:35:27] time I come into a headbutt a Crossroads
[1:35:29] with this word I am going to take the
[1:35:32] word and die to myself and put the word
[1:35:33] and that is how the word is being made
[1:35:36] flesh in our day that's why she's the
[1:35:38] anointed when she's anointed by God to
[1:35:40] lay down her life and let his life take
[1:35:43] preeminence
[1:35:45] that's how we are the anointed one and
[1:35:47] that's how the bride is the word for
[1:35:49] this day
[1:35:51] don't just leave it off mystically it'll
[1:35:54] magically happen it's magically
[1:35:57] happening when God convicts your heart
[1:35:59] when God brings you face to face with
[1:36:01] the word and something inside of you is
[1:36:03] willing to die that's that is the
[1:36:05] mystical part taking place right there
[1:36:07] that's the mystery becoming unveiled
[1:36:10] that's the mystical that's the
[1:36:11] Supernatural That's God dealing in your
[1:36:13] heart amen don't wait for magic potion
[1:36:15] and fairy dust and all of a sudden I
[1:36:17] step into a perfect condition no we're
[1:36:19] growing into it day by day we're
[1:36:21] surrendering more and more this is the
[1:36:24] reality
[1:36:27] praise God
[1:36:29] it's a lot harder than we thought 20
[1:36:32] years ago
[1:36:33] we thought God would flip the switch and
[1:36:35] it's all done and I'm the manifested
[1:36:37] word
[1:36:39] no we're becoming word we're going up
[1:36:41] word by word
[1:36:44] as the word gets clearer I come in
[1:36:47] greater subjection
[1:36:49] as the word comes fresh I'm surrendering
[1:36:52] more as I see how wrong I was I see my
[1:36:56] wrong motives I see my wrong desire and
[1:36:58] also and I Repent I don't repent from
[1:37:00] doing wrong I Repent from thinking wrong
[1:37:04] anyway
[1:37:05] I'm not repenting from I'm not repenting
[1:37:09] from doing wrong to my brother I'm
[1:37:10] thinking I'm repenting of thinking wrong
[1:37:13] about my brother
[1:37:15] you see how the words bringing more a
[1:37:18] more reality bringing more manifestation
[1:37:22] no more white sepulchers but let it be
[1:37:25] true on the inside
[1:37:26] and manifest on the outside so that the
[1:37:30] visible becomes the manifestation of the
[1:37:33] invisible
[1:37:35] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:37:39] oh Heavenly Father
[1:37:42] let this
[1:37:45] Lord this evening this sermon these
[1:37:47] words
[1:37:49] let it become a living reality in US
[1:37:53] God I so
[1:37:57] don't want to just rehearse a service
[1:38:00] have a religious ceremony
[1:38:04] come and do do time and the sanctuary
[1:38:08] and go out
[1:38:09] having performed a religious Duty I so
[1:38:12] don't want that Lord
[1:38:13] I don't want this facility to be used
[1:38:15] for that I don't want to be used for
[1:38:17] that
[1:38:18] well we didn't come here for that
[1:38:21] we came here to be changed
[1:38:24] we came here to be shaped
[1:38:26] we came here to be corrected we came
[1:38:28] here to be taught we came here to be
[1:38:29] encouraged
[1:38:31] came here to be strengthened
[1:38:33] in the Inner Man
[1:38:36] God I pray that these words would bring
[1:38:38] a reality to our lives
[1:38:41] that we would surrender more and more
[1:38:43] every day
[1:38:45] God as you Reveal Your word more to us
[1:38:48] and you bring us deeper into your word
[1:38:50] may it bring a deeper reality in our
[1:38:53] hearts
[1:38:54] may it bring a Deeper Life may it bring
[1:38:56] more of a union with you more of a
[1:38:59] pureness in our heart a pureness in our
[1:39:01] relationship a pureness in our prayers
[1:39:03] of pureness and our meditations
[1:39:06] and God made that that Purity manifest
[1:39:09] on the outside
[1:39:12] so that the world can see that this word
[1:39:14] is becoming flesh
[1:39:17] the flesh is becoming the word
[1:39:21] for God you promised that you would have
[1:39:23] a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:39:25] you promised that the bride would make
[1:39:27] herself ready
[1:39:29] by taking the garments and putting them
[1:39:31] on
