[9:57] God for the privilege you know brother
[10:00] Danny dundo has been a friend of mine
[10:01] for a long long time amen back long
[10:05] before I was a pastor when I was first
[10:07] ministering I would go out on missions
[10:09] trips and one of the first Brothers to
[10:12] take me under wi was brother Danny and
[10:15] he took me to Indonesia he took me to
[10:18] Myanmar he took me all around the
[10:20] Philippines and I learned a lot from
[10:23] this brother he really influenced me in
[10:25] a very positive way and so I really
[10:27] appreciate amen the impact he's had on
[10:30] the bride all around the world he's been
[10:32] a pastor for 27 years amen and God's
[10:36] used him they started churches started

[10:46] almost 5 years since he was here it's
[10:48] hard to believe amen I know some of you
[10:51] have joined us since that time and maybe

[14:28] congregation are streaming right now so
[14:32] uh they're praying for me of course
[14:33] praying for each and every one of you
[14:35] and I need your prayer so without
[14:37] further Ado we would like to uh go
[14:40] straight to the reading of the
[14:42] word amen let's read from the book of
[14:48] Matthew uh in chapter 21 we will start
[14:52] from verses verse verse one up to verse
[14:55] 10 uh it says here in verse one and when
[15:00] they drew nigh unto
[15:02] Jerusalem and were come to be unto
[15:05] the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus to
[15:09] disciples saying unto them go into the
[15:13] village over against you and straightway
[15:18] you shall find an ass tied and a cult
[15:22] with her loose them and bring them unto
[15:26] me and if anyone say unto
[15:30] you ye shall say the Lord had need of
[15:34] them and straightway he will send them
[15:38] all this was done that it might be
[15:40] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[15:43] prophet saying tell ye the daughter of
[15:45] Zion Behold thy King cometh unto thee
[15:47] Meek and sitting upon an ass and they
[15:50] called the F of an ass and the disciples
[15:53] went and did as Jesus commanded them and
[15:58] brought the ass and the cult and put on
[16:01] them their clothes and they set him
[16:04] thereon and a very great multitude
[16:07] spread their garments in the way others
[16:10] cut down branches from the trees and
[16:12] stro them in the way and the multitudes
[16:14] that went before and that followed cried
[16:17] saying hosana to the son of David
[16:21] blessed is he that come in the name of
[16:23] the Lord hosana in the highest and when
[16:26] he was come into Jerusalem all the city
[16:30] was moved saying who is this amen let's
[16:36] B our heads in prayer dear heavenly
[16:37] father we thank you for your mercy your
[16:41] grace your presence Lord and your word
[16:45] that is being revealed to us and we have
[16:48] come here under expectation not from a
[16:52] man but from the son of man so we thank
[16:55] you once again as we commit this service
[16:58] into your Mighty hands in Jesus Christ's
[17:01] name amen God bless you you may now be
[17:04] seated
[17:06] amen
[17:08] so
[17:10] uh it's good to be back and we I always
[17:15] feel that warmth welcome amen so we're
[17:18] just so happy uh I'm just so happy to be
[17:21] here uh I miss my wife to be with me uh
[17:27] but somehow
[17:29] uh if the Lord ties probably
[17:32] amen uh so I would like to give a title
[17:37] on this simple sermon this
[17:40] morning
[17:41] uh and we want to get that from verse
[17:44] two and this title is being loosed for
[17:48] the Master's use amen being used for the
[17:52] Master's use so we see that uh
[18:00] everything
[18:03] uh said nothing happens by
[18:06] accident everything just happened right
[18:09] on the dot and
[18:13] specifically to the Sons and Daughters
[18:15] of God Amen uh we're fulfilling
[18:20] scriptures amen we're fulfilling
[18:24] prophecies and Jesus Christ in his
[18:27] Earthly
[18:29] Journey he fulfilled every bit of
[18:32] Prophecy that was
[18:35] spoken for
[18:37] him he never deviated from uh uh from
[18:42] any Scripture written of him and I
[18:47] believe while he is the main
[18:50] character there are other character
[18:52] surrounding him amen and everything has
[18:55] to be fulfilled everything has to be in
[18:57] place
[18:59] and I'm just thinking in in verse 8 it
[19:02] it says here in verse 8 a very great
[19:04] great multitude spread their garments in
[19:06] the way others cut down branches from
[19:08] the trees and throw them in the way so
[19:12] everything or
[19:14] everybody is
[19:17] responding as the Fulfillment is being
[19:22] unfolded amen there has to be a a uh an
[19:27] act amen towards the word when it is
[19:29] being fulfilled so uh that's why in in
[19:33] verse 8 we see here that very great
[19:37] multitude spread their garments meaning
[19:40] their overgarments they wanted to uh to
[19:43] throw it on the the the streets and lay
[19:45] it down amen so the uh the ass that that
[19:49] that the Lord Jesus Christ was writing
[19:51] will step into it to it it's like a
[19:54] carpet amen they don't want to let the
[19:58] the the the food of of the ass to uh to
[20:01] touch the ground they throw the their
[20:03] garments and those who who who didn't
[20:06] have
[20:07] overgarments in them amen they others
[20:10] they cut branches from the
[20:13] trees amen so uh and throw them in the
[20:18] way so that means they didn't have to go
[20:21] home because they will miss the
[20:24] opportunity amen so it's the same thing
[20:27] with us amen when we hear God's word
[20:31] when we hear his voice we just don't
[20:33] have to let it pass on us we want to do
[20:37] something we want to drop whatever we
[20:39] can and we're not looking for something
[20:42] that is not within our reach amen we
[20:45] serve the Lord on whatever we have amen
[20:48] whatever is available we're not looking
[20:51] for something you know uh uh uh uh uh
[20:54] young people you know uh uh we're we're
[20:56] praying for something we have ambition
[20:58] we're planning and we want to serve the
[20:59] Lord we want to to do our best in the
[21:02] future amen no we're not expecting any
[21:05] any other day any other future because
[21:07] we have to do what we can in this day
[21:10] and age that we are living in we have to
[21:13] respond on the word today right now not
[21:17] later not tomorrow right now amen so
[21:21] that's why you see they they they they
[21:23] took every
[21:24] opportunity uh those multitude so
[21:28] uh so all these things because you see
[21:32] the uh four the verse four or the fourth
[21:37] verse speaks of uh the
[21:40] Fulfillment of the words of Zariah now
[21:43] in Zariah
[21:45] 9:9 it says Rejoice greatly oh Daughter
[21:49] of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem
[21:51] Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is
[21:55] just and having salvation lowly and
[21:58] riding upon an ass and upon a cult the
[22:01] fall of an ass so this is the the the
[22:05] Fulfillment uh or or this was a prophecy
[22:08] and later on being fulfilled in verse 4
[22:12] of Matthew chapter
[22:14] 21 uh so uh the Lord never deviated from
[22:20] anything that is written of him now let
[22:22] me put a quote on this brother bam said
[22:25] God then what was he doing what is that
[22:29] attraction up there on the hill he said
[22:32] it's god making
[22:34] history and God fulfilling prophecy and
[22:38] that always causes an attraction so
[22:41] every time if prophecy is being
[22:45] fulfilled it creates an attraction amen
[22:48] it uh uh and because uh uh there is an
[22:53] attraction it creates
[22:55] reaction so that's why uh in in in in
[23:00] verse 10 he said and when he was come
[23:03] into
[23:04] Jerusalem all the city was moved meaning
[23:09] everybody did their part that's right
[23:12] amen everybody did their part because
[23:15] all amen all who have witnessed his
[23:18] coming all the city was moved saying who
[23:22] is this amen some were uh uh wondering
[23:27] who is this is but there were
[23:31] people who really knew who he was am he
[23:36] knew they knew what was taking place and
[23:40] they could identify that in the
[23:44] scripture amen and that's the very
[23:46] purpose we are here the brother of God
[23:48] said we need to see our place in the
[23:51] scripture sir we need to recognize our
[23:54] day and the time that we are living in
[23:57] and and what is the message of the hour
[24:00] in the day that we're living in because
[24:02] we're not living in yesterday's light
[24:05] we're living in today's light we need to
[24:09] walk in the light because he is in the
[24:11] light not he will be in the light he is
[24:13] in the light amen so now they they they
[24:17] responded so others Wonder but others
[24:19] they were
[24:20] specifically uh aware of what's uh uh
[24:24] what's taking place and then in
[24:26] paragraph 57 he said brother bam said
[24:29] now when God fulfills his word it always
[24:32] causes an attractions always does causes
[24:35] an attraction for it is
[24:37] unusual so unusual when he fulfills his
[24:40] word to the Modern Trend of the day cuz
[24:43] the Modern Trend of the day don't
[24:44] believe in it they have their own way
[24:48] amen because it happens because
[24:51] sometimes people get used to something
[24:53] that is already happening and they get
[24:57] used to it and it becomes their safety
[25:00] zone amen
[25:03] right
[25:05] but God never runs out of an
[25:08] attraction and his attraction is always
[25:11] on the Fulfillment of the word amen and
[25:14] so when that word is being fulfilled it
[25:16] creates an
[25:17] attraction and people react because
[25:22] they're being moved so the people who
[25:25] are being moved they did what they can
[25:29] they they laid everything what they have
[25:32] amen so whatever was available in their
[25:34] hand they responded but people you know
[25:38] sometimes when something is taking place
[25:40] they do not want to go out of their
[25:42] safety
[25:44] zone fear is coming yeah amen because
[25:48] they're afraid to go out of their safety
[25:51] zone amen but God always tears amen his
[25:55] nest yeah amen
[25:58] because uh
[26:00] uh God doesn't want us to to of course
[26:04] we want to be relaxed we're resting in
[26:06] the hand of the Lord but sometimes we
[26:08] get too much uh rest and become so
[26:12] confident amen and and remember in the
[26:15] time of Peace
[26:17] amen unexpected time comes and then
[26:21] suddenly
[26:24] work just like what's happening in
[26:26] Israel right now amen but God
[26:30] knows what he is
[26:32] doing amen so everything so uh
[26:36] everything that Jesus did in his Earthly
[26:39] Journey as I said was a fulfillment of a
[26:43] prophecy
[26:45] but uh we don't have to push the
[26:49] prophecy to be
[26:51] fulfilled amen because prophecies will
[26:54] happen no matter what that's because
[26:57] what's the what's the point of knowing
[27:01] the prophecy and yet and yet you cannot
[27:04] adapt yourself your life does not match
[27:08] the time the the prophecies are being
[27:11] fulfilled amen we should be we should be
[27:14] aware of how we should live rather than
[27:18] just watching what's taking place around
[27:21] us amen
[27:24] uh because habak said the bishop
[27:28] is yet for an appointed time but at the
[27:30] end it shall speak and not lie though it
[27:32] t wait for it because it will surely
[27:35] come it will not
[27:38] t God always fulfills his word it will
[27:43] come to pass it will not t it will
[27:46] happen right on the dot right on the
[27:48] very specific time God knows it amen
[27:51] amen so you know sometimes it's good to
[27:54] talk about prophecies prophecies
[27:56] fulfilling fulfill something like that
[27:58] amen just like you
[28:00] know uh uh in the Philippines perhaps in
[28:06] other countries as well you know
[28:10] uh years back I
[28:12] remember uh some preachers uh when Obama
[28:17] was the was the Pres he became the
[28:21] president and he said oh amen his
[28:25] presidency will no long will no longer
[28:29] be finished the Lord will come Rapture
[28:32] will take place amen because they quoted
[28:36] the scripture and say uh Obama is like
[28:42] uh the king or the Pharaoh that did not
[28:45] know
[28:46] Joseph oh they can fit in a scripture
[28:50] with something and then uh but Obama's
[28:55] term completed
[28:57] [Laughter]
[28:59] and you know after Obama uh he said they
[29:03] were waiting for uh a woman president
[29:08] because we know it's part of the
[29:10] scripture and then we're we're just
[29:11] happy watching things coming to pass you
[29:14] know but they so Focus so much on this
[29:18] thing and then so it it didn't happen
[29:22] now here comes so this is the woman
[29:24] president this is the woman president
[29:26] all those things we're expecting for
[29:28] that to happen Amen in fact we know part
[29:32] of that have happened already but
[29:35] suddenly it wasn't Hillary Clinton who
[29:39] came
[29:40] out so they changed again change again
[29:44] the prophecy oh it's not the woman
[29:48] president it will be the last
[29:54] Trump so there will be no next president
[29:57] for the United States this will be the
[29:59] last
[30:01] Trump amen and remember prior to Obama
[30:05] amen it was you know uh it was uh George
[30:09] Bush and uh uh the 911 uh happened you
[30:13] know and they say now uh uh uh George
[30:17] Bush uh declared war in Afghanistan amen
[30:21] so this is the burning
[30:26] bush so they don't run out of
[30:30] prophecies just to be different just to
[30:33] stay their you know deep and you know
[30:35] they can they can see times you know but
[30:38] what is there if it's if it will happen
[30:41] it will happen it will come to pass but
[30:43] the thing is how do we place ourselves
[30:46] our lives in the scripture are we on the
[30:50] right spot then when the Lord comes amen
[30:53] amen that when the Lord comes we're
[30:54] going to meet him up there in the air
[30:57] Hallelujah so you see they don't run out
[30:59] so here comes now the this the last TR
[31:02] and then Here Comes amen and and and and
[31:06] Donald Trump uh did not win because they
[31:09] say Amen the White House is is not for
[31:13] Trump again it's
[31:19] forbidden
[31:23] Biden we don't have to pour the
[31:27] prophecies to be
[31:29] fulfilled because amen we ourselves are
[31:33] fulfilling the scriptures amen so that's
[31:36] why when we say Amen judgment begins in
[31:39] the house of God Amen we're not just
[31:41] thinking of the temple the sanctuary the
[31:43] church judgment begins in the house of
[31:46] God if you are the house of God then you
[31:49] can find yourself in the scripture amen
[31:51] and then find out and judge it whether
[31:54] your life right now pitch the scripture
[31:57] that when he comes right now that when
[31:59] he picks us when he picks the bride we
[32:01] will be part of we are part of it amen
[32:05] so prophecies amen those are things
[32:07] everything is properly in place and so
[32:11] now the in in this uh when when God
[32:15] fulfills his prophecy amen it must be
[32:20] complete amen uh uh with with with a
[32:25] very simple example we
[32:28] uh I remember when uh brother bam they
[32:31] were in a hunting
[32:33] trip uh brother
[32:36] adisal you know he was still young at
[32:38] that time and in the vision that brother
[32:41] brandham saw amen there were Beast there
[32:44] were uh grizzly bear and uh uh all this
[32:49] and all the characters and then he was
[32:51] as he was waiting he was asking was
[32:54] looking for the uh people around him but
[32:57] no
[32:58] one wearing a checkered
[33:01] shirt
[33:03] amen and brother bam was
[33:07] waiting and you know the brother who was
[33:10] with him they want to do something but
[33:13] brother bam was waiting amen because in
[33:16] the vision it was so
[33:18] clear and so God is the one that do and
[33:23] fulfill his word amen he will make it
[33:27] happen to prove and vindicate his word
[33:32] and you never nobody expected that even
[33:35] even brother Ed did not expect that and
[33:37] then he tumbled and he his shirt got wet
[33:40] and without you know he he was just
[33:41] moved amen he just reacted on what had
[33:44] happened and he had to
[33:46] change and when he had to change he
[33:48] opened his his back and there is the
[33:51] checkered shirt amen his wife never knew
[33:55] that he never knew it no but no one knew
[33:58] it but brother bham being the prophet
[34:00] was waiting because prophets amen
[34:03] they're always obedient to the heavenly
[34:06] vision amen so we are being moved amen
[34:10] uh uh with all and we are being
[34:13] attracted amen when things go on and now
[34:17] all the city were moved but others say
[34:19] who is this what's going on what is this
[34:23] message of all about and the people
[34:26] people's reaction on the word or on the
[34:29] Fulfillment of the word is based on the
[34:33] seed that is in
[34:35] them I like this portion when uh uh uh
[34:41] when brother Brenham made mention that
[34:43] there are there are there are people
[34:46] amen that are
[34:49] predestinated to see the word in their
[34:51] day and I'm glad are you glad this
[34:53] morning that you are part of those who
[34:55] are fulfilling this thing
[34:57] amen so you see now uh uh in in in the
[35:00] same message what is the attraction on
[35:02] the mountain he said he had made up his
[35:04] little group out of a bunch of poor
[35:06] people fishermen tax gather is
[35:08] uneducated the Bible said some of them
[35:11] were were even ignorant unlearn some
[35:13] could not even sign their name he never
[35:15] went to the churches to get his people
[35:18] and he never agreed with any of the
[35:20] church leaders and besides he followed
[35:23] the very trend of a prophet he condemned
[35:26] everything that they done as the ones
[35:28] before him had because they were a
[35:32] portion of the word and he was the word
[35:35] in its
[35:36] fullness amen so you might be occupying
[35:40] a seat
[35:42] there but you are let me tell you this
[35:46] that you are fulfilling a portion you
[35:49] are a portion of the word amen amen you
[35:53] are part of the prophecy being fulfilled
[35:56] in in this day you are doing what you
[35:59] have to do and you cannot go away from
[36:02] it because you are you have a nature in
[36:05] you you are HH you have a seed in you
[36:08] and you are predestinated to fulfill
[36:10] your portion in this generation
[36:13] Hallelujah and when you realize that
[36:16] amen you you there is no fear there is
[36:19] no
[36:20] insecurities amen there's no jealousy
[36:23] whatsoever because you know no matter
[36:25] what you are fulfilling a portion of the
[36:28] word allotted for you nobody can do what
[36:32] you can do because you are predestinated
[36:35] to that we cannot be somebody I cannot
[36:37] be brother Chad he cannot be brother
[36:39] Dany amen we he cannot we we cannot be
[36:41] anybody else except me except him amen
[36:45] because we are just fulfilling the very
[36:48] portion amen and sometimes you know uh
[36:51] uh uh uh uh something happens when
[36:55] somebody wants to put fulfill something
[36:57] that is not predestinated for him to do
[37:01] so that's why we need to realize who we
[37:03] are and what we are fulfilling in this
[37:06] generation amen so we are he said they
[37:09] were a portion of that word now there
[37:12] are many people who said they were uh
[37:14] the ones who ought to have loved him he
[37:16] said he came to his own and his own
[37:18] received him now amen so he said now the
[37:21] ones who ought to have loved him the
[37:23] ones who ought to have been for him
[37:25] where his bitter B
[37:27] enemies amen and then the next paragraph
[37:30] you said but in the midst of all of it
[37:33] through every age and every Prophet that
[37:35] had been or would be there is going to
[37:38] be a certain amount of people that's
[37:42] predestinated to hear that message and
[37:45] they will follow it I'm glad amen I'm
[37:49] glad I'm
[37:51] predestinated amen so I don't whether
[37:54] whether sometimes you present this
[37:56] message it is so clear it's so simple
[37:58] others don't understand it yeah amen but
[38:01] people unlearned uneducated but the
[38:04] moment they hear it they receive the
[38:07] message amen I remember uh uh I I
[38:12] remember one family in in our church and
[38:15] uh
[38:18] uh you know my my my father in-law uh
[38:22] was among the uh early ministers in the
[38:25] message in the Philippines and then we
[38:28] we went to the province and then uh by
[38:30] God's grace we were able to uh to start
[38:33] a small uh group there it's the province
[38:37] of Isabella my wife was born there
[38:38] that's why he she was named after that
[38:41] Province amen so that's why when we
[38:43] enter into that Province there is a
[38:46] mountain there and they cut the mountain
[38:49] and so there is you're entering amen and
[38:52] it's it's a big name there Isabella amen
[38:56] so so my wife owns that mountain
[38:59] Isabella amen so uh I remember brother
[39:04] Chas my brother-in-law brother cha we we
[39:07] we had a simple Bible study and the
[39:09] first Bible study that we had they
[39:11] belong to uh UPC group at that time and
[39:17] I shared about the original Scene It was
[39:20] among the first Bible studies that we
[39:23] did uh in that place it's uh 10 hours
[39:27] from Manila so you know I we have to
[39:30] travel 10 hours just to uh you know so I
[39:34] decided to share that amen and some
[39:38] might have been thinking it's too early
[39:40] to share that original Scene It Might
[39:41] stumble them so but I felt led to share
[39:45] it amen but the Father the father of uh
[39:49] uh of brother Chiba amen he
[39:53] was
[39:55] seriously
[39:57] hearing what every bit of detail I was
[40:00] sharing and through the scripture and
[40:03] immediately after that he said I have
[40:06] been I have been believing it was really
[40:10] not an apple amen amen but now it is
[40:14] scripturally
[40:15] cleared amen and the whole family
[40:18] accepted the message amen the the father
[40:22] brother Chiba died his his mother
[40:24] remains faithful in the message and then
[40:26] brother Chiba married my my my youngest
[40:30] uh sister-in-law and now we have another
[40:33] church brother Chiba is pastoring
[40:34] another church amen the the the Church
[40:37] of my former uh uh uh uh Pastor uh uh
[40:41] remains intact until now amen so why but
[40:46] people amen could think oh you're you're
[40:48] all Fanatics and everything amen but you
[40:51] come to think of that there are people
[40:53] who are really
[40:54] predestinated because they could the the
[40:57] seed in them could recognize the word
[41:01] amen hallelujah so that's why in
[41:03] Revelation chapter 3:14 I believe he
[41:06] said uh write these things sayth the
[41:09] amen amen write these things sayth the
[41:12] amen so our amen is not just our
[41:16] expression because we get excited or the
[41:20] the man the woman beside us say amen and
[41:22] we say Amen too amen but actually the
[41:25] amen is a person in Revelation 3:14 amen
[41:29] he said uh uh write this things sayth
[41:32] the amen so the amen is a person amen
[41:37] that that that will recognize himself
[41:40] that will recognize the word amen so
[41:44] that amening in you is the part of him
[41:47] the part of the word recognizing the
[41:50] word amen write this thing sayth the
[41:53] amen so your amen is the person of
[41:56] himself in you recognizing the word in
[41:59] your day Hallelujah write this thing
[42:02] sayth the
[42:06] amen who is the amen the beginning of
[42:09] the creation of God the faithful and
[42:12] through
[42:13] witness he was just he's there he knew
[42:16] everything amen so he knows that that
[42:20] Amen in you amen is the same person the
[42:23] same God the same word that's why he
[42:27] recognized
[42:28] [Applause]
[42:30] himself so remember that when you say
[42:33] Amen it's not you when you're the one
[42:36] aiming to the word it's you you're just
[42:38] excited but when he the person in
[42:42] you amen urge you say
[42:48] amen amen so he said now amen and so the
[42:51] whole family and now the two uh the two
[42:54] Elder brothers so brother chib they're
[42:56] prayerfully serving the lord both of the
[42:58] ministers elders of the
[43:02] church amen just for a single Bible
[43:05] study yes sir God it produce one
[43:10] church because they recognize their
[43:13] portion in the word amen so many will
[43:16] reject many will turn their backs
[43:18] against this word but there are people
[43:21] like you and me who are predestinated to
[43:25] see amen hallelujah that's the way the
[43:29] Lord trust us amen so now you see now in
[43:32] Matthew verse 21:6 he said now uh they
[43:37] were entering into the city Jesus could
[43:40] have entered he had the power he had
[43:46] power they were entering it was time for
[43:49] him to enter
[43:51] Jerusalem but he was
[43:54] watching he could have entered
[43:58] Jerusalem but he needs to see the
[44:03] complete
[44:05] sin of the
[44:07] prophecy amen so Zechariah
[44:11] 9:9 he knew he was the one riding on an
[44:15] ass but where is the ass so Jesus knew
[44:20] where that ass was amen and so now the
[44:24] the the disciples with him were part of
[44:27] the
[44:29] prophecy Jesus knew the ass where it is
[44:33] being tied he could have gone their
[44:36] straight but the disciples were part of
[44:39] the
[44:41] prophecy amen so he
[44:44] said the disciples went he said he
[44:47] command and did as Jesus commanded them
[44:50] and brought the ass and the cult and put
[44:53] them on their clothes and they set him
[44:56] him thereon amen so now what are we
[45:00] doing now what is brother Danny doing
[45:03] what is brother Jad doing what the Bible
[45:04] Ministry
[45:05] doing we're just under the
[45:09] instruction of the
[45:11] master amen it's not our own conviction
[45:14] but it it is under the instruction of
[45:18] him who saw us in the vision yeah who so
[45:22] as part of the Fulfillment of this great
[45:25] prophecy in the last day that's right
[45:27] amen and so when when you when when you
[45:31] uh uh when you move when you act on
[45:34] something and you know you are
[45:36] fulfilling the scripture you have
[45:39] confidence amen amen uh uh I preached uh
[45:44] in the Church of brother Steven Shambo
[45:46] the the right side of the ship and I
[45:50] said the right side of the ship is not
[45:52] just the opposite of the
[45:54] left or maybe opposite of wrong because
[45:58] it's the right side of the ship amen
[46:01] because uh when they throw the when they
[46:04] threw the net it was the same side the
[46:06] same ship the same net and the same
[46:10] fishermen amen but what makes the
[46:12] difference is that they're going to
[46:14] throw the net
[46:16] under the
[46:18] instruction amen yeah they threw the
[46:21] whole night the same net because they
[46:25] were doing it on their
[46:27] own but after his resurrection amen they
[46:32] were
[46:33] instructed Amen to throw the net again
[46:36] amen and said they got they got
[46:40] fish amen amen and they got great
[46:45] fish probably you know not many fish but
[46:49] great
[46:50] fish and you know it's a different net
[46:55] it's the
[46:56] the the same Bible but it's now a
[46:58] different Bible because we have
[47:01] different spiritual perspective because
[47:04] of the message of the hour amen so there
[47:07] were many great fish and the good thing
[47:10] there the net was not
[47:15] broken we are being caught by this
[47:17] message net and no matter how many
[47:20] people how many distraction how many
[47:23] would like to discredit the prophet and
[47:25] this message of the hour the net will
[47:27] not be
[47:29] broken amen it can it keep will keep on
[47:32] getting great fish amen for his glory so
[47:36] now you see now they were under the
[47:38] instruction they went there and to give
[47:41] them confidence if somebody stop
[47:44] you just speak the word and say the
[47:47] master needs
[47:49] them amen so when they went there and
[47:52] the disciples went and did as Jesus
[47:54] commanded them and brought the ass and
[47:55] the cult and put on them their clothes
[47:57] and they set them set him there on Amen
[48:02] now now cat on this thing he said he put
[48:05] on them their
[48:09] clothes so this might be something not
[48:13] normal but every natural thing types is
[48:17] spiritual amen so the uh uh if we if we
[48:22] see if we see that in a symbolic form
[48:26] what the uh uh the disciples wore amen
[48:32] they put it on the
[48:36] Beast amen and on top of that the master
[48:40] the king the Lord Jesus Christ sat on
[48:44] that so remember that the Beast is power
[48:48] yeah amen amen uh so for many years we
[48:52] don't know how
[48:53] long uh the ass and the cult were there
[48:57] yeah loose uh uh tied
[49:02] amen but when the time came that they
[49:05] will be
[49:07] loosed amen for the Master's
[49:12] use sometimes we're being tied to
[49:14] something we don't know how long
[49:17] sometimes we're being tied to our job to
[49:18] our work amen to any circumstance we
[49:22] bring tith for
[49:24] everything but when your time
[49:27] comes amen and under the instruction of
[49:31] the master somebody shares you the word
[49:35] somebody calls you and something happens
[49:38] you know you got loose amen you got
[49:42] loose we're being free we're being
[49:44] released out of all these things and now
[49:48] we are for the Master's
[49:51] use Hallelujah I have been uh uh my my
[49:55] my friends brother Chad knew our story
[49:58] amen you know uh uh at the younger age
[50:01] you have dreams you you have Ambitions
[50:05] amen we're so tied with all these things
[50:08] amen and uh uh it was I have many dreams
[50:14] but I never dreamed to be a
[50:16] pastor amen because I was
[50:20] tied with every bit of ambition before
[50:25] amen amen and but God knows what to do
[50:30] he will place Us in some
[50:32] situations amen that our bonds our
[50:36] chains will be
[50:38] cut and I thank God now amen I committed
[50:42] myself I recognize that I am loose for
[50:46] the Master's use not for anyone else
[50:50] amen so now you see that's the same
[50:53] thing that that we're doing in and uh
[50:56] brother Franco entered into the office
[50:58] this morning and we're just a quick and
[51:00] we're we're we're we're doing uh uh we
[51:04] were able to have uh testimony and you
[51:08] know during the
[51:09] pandemic
[51:11] uh we we were instructed to stay home we
[51:16] cannot go outside we cannot cross
[51:18] borders because there are many
[51:20] checkpoints amen but uh by God's grace
[51:24] we were blessed
[51:26] and uh in the Philippines being a
[51:27] minister we are considered
[51:30] frontliners and uh we have uh uh we have
[51:35] this we just have to have our IDs and
[51:39] everything amen but uh the Lord knows
[51:44] what he is doing and I I know I have
[51:47] sent few reports on that and uh we have
[51:50] we have brothers working with us in the
[51:52] province of NOA we have uh people
[51:54] working with us of course you know
[51:56] brother Val amen you know uh these
[51:59] brothers brother dondon brother brother
[52:01] Nan brother Elvin you know and then uh
[52:06] they're younger than us amen and we now
[52:10] recognize
[52:12] that amen
[52:15] so and after the immediately after the
[52:19] pandemic there is one good story I want
[52:21] to tell uh there is a brother
[52:26] uh he messaged me and said pastor we
[52:29] were blessed you know it's just good
[52:31] that I have I have three sons who know
[52:34] things and uh when we were going to
[52:37] Myanmar to Indonesia we're doing all
[52:40] these gadgets that we have for the
[52:42] translation and because they were so old
[52:45] you know we just uh uh because we
[52:47] stopped going to Myanmar because of the
[52:49] military control right now and so we
[52:51] pick these are all things all gadgets
[52:53] that we had before and the the very
[52:57] first day the very first day I I we just

[53:08] we were in Japan during that time and we
[53:11] could not go home I don't know but 3
[53:13] days prior amen was the shutdown and I
[53:17] said I when when when we were on the
[53:19] table as a family I talked to my to my
[53:22] son and said I cannot just you know let
[53:24] this thing we people cannot go to church
[53:27] and uh I cannot just sit down without
[53:30] doing anything and so I I said let us
[53:34] look for all all those old gadgets and
[53:36] you just check and you know if we can if
[53:39] you can make it work and we were able to
[53:40] make it work and then those little
[53:42] cameras that we have and so we set we
[53:45] set a table in in our home amen and it
[53:48] it become a uh a a simple studio and for
[53:53] a period of 1 month month straight amen
[53:57] the first month of uh uh of the the the
[54:01] shutdown every day brother John amen we
[54:05] uh uh we did uh Bible study and
[54:08] everything and it benefited a lot of
[54:13] families and they kept on you know and I
[54:16] was inspired to do it so it's St and
[54:17] then later on sometimes it got loose
[54:20] amen so we did it in the duration of the
[54:24] uh uh pandemic
[54:26] and but in the church we never miss a
[54:27] single
[54:28] service because uh our church is a
[54:33] compound uh so we are in in a corner you
[54:38] know that brother the Chad we're we're
[54:39] in s in a corner but the other side is
[54:42] another
[54:43] community so this side is another
[54:45] community so we have Gates here we have
[54:49] gate on this side amen and so in the
[54:52] corner we have the the policemen there
[54:58] so what we do amen we provide food for
[55:00] the once in a while we provide food for
[55:03] the
[55:06] policemen and so people can come in on
[55:09] this side or from the other community
[55:11] some of them the head of the families
[55:13] could enter the church and then so to
[55:16] cut the story short we were not a we we
[55:20] we we did not miss any single service so
[55:22] we were able uh to to stream service and
[55:25] then uh the people outside and this
[55:27] young brother he said uh Pastor Dan he
[55:31] said can we download your message and I
[55:33] would like to share this to my family
[55:36] amen later on uh he shared it to the
[55:38] family and then to the neighbors and uh
[55:42] eventually because people could not do
[55:44] anything and in the province it's it's
[55:45] not that straight so under the the
[55:48] shades of the tree there is a monitor in
[55:51] front and they put up chairs and they
[55:55] were watching our
[55:57] service and there's no signal there so
[55:59] the brother will download the will
[56:01] download the uh the service and they
[56:04] will they will stream up uh watch that
[56:07] the following week so they are delayed a
[56:10] week amen but they were rejoicing and
[56:14] eventually it appeared to be a church
[56:15] and immediately after the after the uh
[56:20] pandemic we went there it's probably 12
[56:22] or 14 hours from our place and it's a
[56:25] good place it's a coastal area in we and
[56:28] we baptized 25 souls for God's
[56:32] glory many were got
[56:35] loosed and now they are in the master sh
[56:40] and that brother amen keep on going and
[56:43] now we are building a
[56:47] church amen his name is brother rang was
[56:50] you you met him when you were there and
[56:52] so we we just do what we weekend and
[56:56] upon checking after that uh pandemic
[56:59] thing amen we are free to go out we go
[57:02] to the mountains as long as it's just
[57:04] Isabel that is uh riding with me I can
[57:07] have one company and then my
[57:09] father-in-law
[57:11] died and uh it was at the peak of uh uh
[57:15] of the uh
[57:18] shutdown and so we had to go there in
[57:20] the province and so at that time for the
[57:25] funeral a minister is allowed to
[57:29] travel and the immediate family
[57:34] member and our
[57:36] government because probably uh the
[57:39] situation of our church the the the
[57:43] government issued a certification for me
[57:47] and in that certification they indicated
[57:51] Bishop Dan
[57:53] delmundo
[57:58] [Laughter]
[58:00] we have no Bishop in the message we
[58:03] understand that amen but that's how they
[58:05] see it and so uh now we are allowed in
[58:10] one one vle so if the
[58:12] minister amen he can bring a driver with
[58:16] him so that means I can bring JoJo with
[58:19] me my brother-in-law is is the driver so
[58:23] I'm the I'm the the I'm the
[58:28] bishop and then it's also allowed to
[58:32] have Amen in the funeral immediate
[58:35] family members so I was able to bring my
[58:40] wife because she is a
[58:44] daughter so po Bas him and you know
[58:47] before we reach amen the place we passed
[58:51] through over 30
[58:53] checkpoints
[58:56] and every
[58:57] time where are you going I will say I
[59:00] will show my
[59:04] ID oh Bishop okay go go go
[59:10] go I got the idea now brother John amen
[59:14] so when we came back now we can travel
[59:17] we went from one Community to another
[59:20] amen you know uh uh uh in one in one
[59:23] location uh uh brother Bal went with me
[59:26] and we baptized 19 Souls we baptized 25
[59:29] Souls we baptized and I counted them
[59:32] after the pandemic in the pandemic we
[59:34] were able to baptize close to 200 Souls
[59:38] combined how many Souls have been
[59:41] Loos amen how many Souls have been loose
[59:45] and now they're in the master shoes
[59:48] Hallelujah and so now we have you know I
[59:50] said H my my my my youngest daughter Fai
[59:54] asked me Papa amen when are we going to
[59:57] go out to go for a holiday without
[59:59] having church because everywhere we go
[1:00:02] amen it's you tell me it's a vacation
[1:00:05] but yet there
[1:00:08] is when are we going to have our family
[1:00:12] holiday without having
[1:00:15] church and I said well I said this is
[1:00:17] our life amen but deep inside I felt
[1:00:23] guilty amen so so I said U maybe you
[1:00:27] know I am I'm 60 years old amen and in
[1:00:32] the Philippines when you're 60 years old
[1:00:34] you get your dual
[1:00:36] citizenship you are a Filipino Citizen
[1:00:38] and a senior
[1:00:45] citizen so I said I'm going to slow down
[1:00:48] and uh you know uh but you don't have
[1:00:52] control of your life that's right
[1:00:55] when you're when you are being loosed
[1:00:57] for the Master's use you don't pick you
[1:01:01] don't choose amen because we are here
[1:01:05] for the Master's use and we realize that
[1:01:09] and we have to do what we have to do and
[1:01:11] my family loves it my church my
[1:01:13] congregation understands it and we're
[1:01:15] we're so blessed amen uh uh uh for that
[1:01:19] so you know you see now all these things
[1:01:22] it's because it's just because we have a
[1:01:25] message to
[1:01:27] preach amen and so we are just
[1:01:30] fulfilling because when we are directed
[1:01:33] where when we are moving under the
[1:01:35] instruction of the lord we have great
[1:01:38] confidence that when we share this
[1:01:40] gospel amen two weeks prior to my trip
[1:01:43] to the us we went to the mountainous
[1:01:44] region of Abra banget amen and it was
[1:01:48] for the very first time we went there
[1:01:51] and and the place was so virgin there's
[1:01:53] no message Church there amen uh uh uh we
[1:01:57] travel good Highway 7 hours and we
[1:01:59] traveled another more than 4 hours of
[1:02:01] rough roads amen but when you when we
[1:02:03] get there I got excited I just I just
[1:02:06] felt something within my Within Myself
[1:02:09] and there was a woman amen uh uh that
[1:02:13] was sick amen that was sick in uh uh
[1:02:17] probably over a month amen and he had uh
[1:02:20] she had a a uh oxygen T at the corner of
[1:02:24] her bed and and she said uh the the the
[1:02:30] the the brother told me she's requesting
[1:02:33] a prayer and so we we we okay let's go
[1:02:35] there and we pray and before I prayed
[1:02:38] amen I just opened my Bible and I said
[1:02:40] Can can is it okay to just share you
[1:02:42] just 30 minutes of exhortation amen and
[1:02:45] so we uh I shared and before I ended up
[1:02:49] my
[1:02:50] exhortation amen the woman the woman
[1:02:54] testified and she and she said Thank You
[1:02:58] Lord I have been praying for two weeks
[1:03:02] now I have been praying for a minister
[1:03:05] to come in our village to pray for me
[1:03:09] and you sent Pastor Dany Amen to pray
[1:03:12] for me I have not even prayed for her I
[1:03:16] have not touched her yet I was about to
[1:03:19] give conclusion to my to my exhortation
[1:03:21] and just before that amen she pushed
[1:03:24] herself and sat down at the edge of the
[1:03:27] bed and requested a chair and I have the
[1:03:30] picture she sit down at my side while I
[1:03:33] I I was giving a conclusion I have not
[1:03:36] prayed yet I just shared Jesus Christ
[1:03:38] the same yesterday today and forever by
[1:03:41] his stripes we were healed and she
[1:03:43] claimed it without even laying my hands
[1:03:46] on it not even praying but her F through
[1:03:49] the word she was
[1:03:52] Loos Hallelujah he was loose out of that
[1:03:56] sickness out of that sick bed amen and
[1:03:59] and her granddaughters amen sit down at
[1:04:02] the bed and listen to the word amen and
[1:04:05] by just first visit to that Village we
[1:04:07] baptized five souls for God's glory amen
[1:04:11] and so now another thing we just held
[1:04:14] the meeting in the house we just made
[1:04:16] the uh held the meeting in the house and
[1:04:18] then when the people heard now they say
[1:04:21] why don't we why don't we why don't we
[1:04:23] do it
[1:04:24] uh in the
[1:04:26] community uh uh in the health centers
[1:04:29] that they say we want to do it in the
[1:04:31] community can we uh can we invite you
[1:04:33] and so they did it uh to uh in the
[1:04:38] community we we uh we had an open
[1:04:42] service and while we were doing that it
[1:04:46] just reminded me of the old
[1:04:49] times because it was in in in the
[1:04:52] innermost part of the mountains it just
[1:04:54] reminded me during the old times when
[1:04:57] you can just stand on one corner and
[1:04:59] sing songs and people will stop and
[1:05:02] listen now during that evening amen uh
[1:05:06] the people one family after the other
[1:05:08] they're coming out Amen to to hear the
[1:05:11] word amen and I just felt something is
[1:05:15] going to take place in that Province
[1:05:18] amen there many
[1:05:21] tied ass and calls in that Village that
[1:05:24] needs to be that need to be loosed amen
[1:05:28] for God's glory amen and thank you we we
[1:05:31] we will appreciate all your prayers amen
[1:05:33] for all these things to happen so now
[1:05:36] come to think of that so you see let me
[1:05:39] just check this for a
[1:05:43] while so now after that they they they
[1:05:47] committed and the in that same
[1:05:49] evening I got
[1:05:52] loosed and my wife wife was in front
[1:05:56] sitting and I was not looking at
[1:05:59] her
[1:06:01] because I felt I I I I I I I discerned
[1:06:05] what he what she was trying to say she
[1:06:08] was trying to tell me it's time it's
[1:06:11] evening already everybody sleeping early
[1:06:14] in the village amen but I got loose
[1:06:21] brother I just preached my heart out and
[1:06:25] just you know never mind the time you
[1:06:27] know but you know uh the following day I
[1:06:30] thought the the chief of the village
[1:06:32] will get mad but the chief of the
[1:06:34] village said amen next time you do we do
[1:06:37] that amen you come over you're always
[1:06:39] welcome and you can we can do that in
[1:06:41] the in the in in the covered court and
[1:06:44] we can invite more people amen
[1:06:47] hallelujah so many potential uh uh uh uh
[1:06:52] Beast that are willing to to serve are
[1:06:54] waiting for us brothers and sisters we
[1:06:57] just have to let them lose for the
[1:07:00] Master's use amen
[1:07:03] hallelujah wait something happened
[1:07:08] here hallelujah so Satan is mad to us
[1:07:12] amen so now again let's go back to that
[1:07:15] point so you see brother brandham made
[1:07:19] mention a lot of things in this
[1:07:22] generation and we have to
[1:07:25] realize that uh being part of the body
[1:07:28] the mystical body of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:30] Christ each one of us has a portion to
[1:07:33] do we just have to realize what we have
[1:07:36] to do for God's glory amen so now when
[1:07:40] they entered into that City remember
[1:07:42] when they entered into that
[1:07:44] City Jesus knew what was
[1:07:47] coming remember you come here this
[1:07:49] morning you prayed and uh uh you have
[1:07:54] come here you we want to be blessed as
[1:07:57] much as possible I want to be blessing
[1:07:59] to be a blessing
[1:08:02] amen probably not much but something
[1:08:06] that would
[1:08:07] help that's a a password between B Chad
[1:08:12] and myself amen so you see now we have
[1:08:16] come here we we sing songs we're
[1:08:19] prepared right because we want to be a
[1:08:21] blessing for God's glory amen
[1:08:24] all the way from your home coming here
[1:08:26] we're under
[1:08:28] expectation but think of this when Jesus
[1:08:32] was
[1:08:33] entering the
[1:08:35] city brother bham said he knew it was
[1:08:39] his last visit amen amen he knew the
[1:08:44] sufferings that he had to undergo he
[1:08:47] knew
[1:08:49] everything all the bad things that will
[1:08:51] happen to him but he was full fulfilling
[1:08:54] a scripture and he cannot do away with
[1:08:57] it Hallelujah so he will suffer amen and
[1:09:01] and and and everything all those things
[1:09:04] he had to suffer he knew from his mind
[1:09:08] that's the difference when we come here
[1:09:10] amen but you know Jesus Christ amen
[1:09:14] never never turned his back that's right
[1:09:17] because he wanted to fulfill what is
[1:09:20] written of
[1:09:22] him all right
[1:09:24] amen so when they entered there and now
[1:09:28] so the the the the the Beast you know
[1:09:31] Beast means
[1:09:32] power and
[1:09:35] those
[1:09:36] ask the old and the young and I like
[1:09:40] this portion because in this portion you
[1:09:43] see the the the old and the young they
[1:09:46] were both tied they they were they were
[1:09:50] there and
[1:09:51] so they were being released and then the
[1:09:56] disciples put their clothes on top of
[1:10:01] the Beast and the Lord sat down
[1:10:03] there now let me quote he said brother
[1:10:06] bam said the pipul ministry they were
[1:10:10] asked you know have
[1:10:13] you he was being asked is there anything
[1:10:16] that the PIP that the that the bride uh
[1:10:20] should the bride have a Ministry before
[1:10:22] the rapture
[1:10:24] you know brother bram's answer right and
[1:10:27] brother brandham said well he
[1:10:31] said
[1:10:33] yes the bride has a Ministry and it's
[1:10:36] going to be it's going to be a humble
[1:10:38] Ministry amen and he said it is the
[1:10:40] fivefold ministry he made mention the
[1:10:44] fivefold ministry that they will fulfill
[1:10:48] and they're fulfilling scriptures the
[1:10:49] fivefold ministry and I like that
[1:10:51] portion that brother bam said that the
[1:10:54] the the PIP Ministry are God's dress
[1:11:00] wear they're God's dress we amen so if
[1:11:05] they're God's dress
[1:11:07] we they were in spiritual
[1:11:13] condition they know how to dress
[1:11:16] themselves on the natural
[1:11:18] aspect and now just like they were God's
[1:11:22] dress wear now they
[1:11:24] are
[1:11:26] dressing the
[1:11:29] bride with what they have so we see here
[1:11:34] a transition amen that because when they
[1:11:37] entered they they dressed the they
[1:11:39] dressed the the uh uh the Beast and then
[1:11:42] the Beast carried the burden amen he he
[1:11:46] they uh uh he he brought the the Lord
[1:11:50] into the city of Jerusalem to fulfill
[1:11:52] the word but what I am so excited about
[1:11:56] is to see because all the all all all
[1:12:00] these years I've been you know my my
[1:12:02] focus was just on the ass that the Lord
[1:12:05] wrote
[1:12:07] amen
[1:12:09] but he was not the only one being
[1:12:12] tight
[1:12:13] right but Jesus
[1:12:17] said lose
[1:12:20] them not just the one he's going to use
[1:12:24] at that time yeah amen Jesus Christ said
[1:12:28] lose them not just
[1:12:33] her amen lose them amen and if somebody
[1:12:37] stop you amen tell them amen
[1:12:42] that they're going to be used by the
[1:12:46] master hallelujah amen and they will not
[1:12:50] stop you
[1:12:52] amen okay now I do not want to miss this
[1:12:56] portion so I have to repeat now he said
[1:13:00] would the bride of Christ have a
[1:13:02] Ministry before the Rapture and said
[1:13:05] sure that's what's going on right now
[1:13:08] certainly it is the message of the hour
[1:13:11] the bride of Christ is consist of
[1:13:13] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:13:15] and pastors is that right that's the
[1:13:17] bride of Christ sure she's got a
[1:13:19] Ministry great ministry it's the
[1:13:21] ministry of the hour in it will be so
[1:13:25] humble amen amen now it will be so
[1:13:29] humble why is so humble because you know
[1:13:33] when the ass entered into the City and
[1:13:36] everybody was throwing their garments
[1:13:38] throwing leaves and
[1:13:41] branches the the ass said in himself oh
[1:13:46] thank you thank you and she he the ass
[1:13:50] appreciate all those uh uh carpet like
[1:13:54] garments and branches you know he's rece
[1:13:56] because he felt he's receiving all the
[1:13:58] credits thank you thank
[1:14:04] you but those branches and those
[1:14:06] garments were not for
[1:14:08] him right amen but he was into it
[1:14:13] because the
[1:14:14] master was on top of
[1:14:17] him amen hallelujah oh the Lord may the
[1:14:20] Lord help us ministers amen that when
[1:14:23] the Lord use us amen when the master use
[1:14:27] us we don't deserve the credit amen
[1:14:29] because the glory belongs only to him
[1:14:33] amen so we we we yeah we we we we want
[1:14:35] to be appreciated sometimes amen but let
[1:14:38] us be like amen we Minister should be
[1:14:41] like amen David that when David received
[1:14:44] that water and those three great
[1:14:46] warriors amen they jerise their lives
[1:14:49] amen David did not drink the water that
[1:14:51] he wanted to because because of the
[1:14:53] sacrifices of his Warriors he poured the
[1:14:56] water to the ground amen and said Lord I
[1:14:59] don't deserve this thing because these
[1:15:02] kind of sacrifices only belong to you
[1:15:05] our God Amen may the Lord help us amen
[1:15:09] that the ministry the piple ministry
[1:15:11] will remain in humility that whenever we
[1:15:15] being used by God we are just being used
[1:15:17] we're just vessels of God Amen but the
[1:15:20] glory belongs only to him and we're just
[1:15:24] privilege to be part of this calling
[1:15:28] hallelujah we're just part of this
[1:15:29] calling amen and so now he said now God
[1:15:33] in the message putting on the whole
[1:15:35] armor of God now God fortified this Army
[1:15:37] what with himself amen
[1:15:40] amen he covered him himself not anyone
[1:15:44] else amen he fortified this Army what
[1:15:47] with himself in the form of prophets
[1:15:50] Apostles teachers pastors what did he do
[1:15:52] what was going what was God doing listen
[1:15:55] did you ever think of what the offices
[1:15:57] of the church is it is God's
[1:16:00] dress inside dress an apostle or Prophet
[1:16:03] is for see before Satan ever gets to it
[1:16:07] amen done told it amen God dress up in
[1:16:09] his church these offices is God's dress
[1:16:13] where amen so how can we make it to the
[1:16:17] Rapture how can we obtain God's
[1:16:20] righteousness without enjoying the
[1:16:23] benefits of the pipel ministry
[1:16:26] Hallelujah we cannot go to the Rapture
[1:16:28] without a pastor so thank God that we
[1:16:31] have a pastor thank God that we benefit
[1:16:33] from teachers missionaries amen a
[1:16:36] prophet and everything so we should
[1:16:38] benefit from because this is God's dress
[1:16:41] wear amen they are being instructed by
[1:16:44] the Lord this offic is not the men but
[1:16:47] the offices were under the inspiration
[1:16:50] the anointing of God the master of all
[1:16:53] Hallelujah but this is what we're
[1:16:56] praying for amen that no
[1:17:00] matter how great the Lord used the
[1:17:03] ministry may we stay in that office in
[1:17:06] that anointing of humility amen amen
[1:17:09] that we stay humble in the presence of
[1:17:11] the Lord amen uh prayerful and humble in
[1:17:15] everything I'm praying for that I said
[1:17:17] you know I said in myself you know I'm
[1:17:21] old I'm not young
[1:17:23] anymore
[1:17:25] amen these These are
[1:17:30] proof we have nothing to prove amen
[1:17:35] because it's only God who can vindicate
[1:17:38] you know we cannot even defend we cannot
[1:17:41] even protect our own
[1:17:43] Ministry it must be God am amen it must
[1:17:47] be God and and uh I thank God that we're
[1:17:51] being identified with uh with such a
[1:17:54] Ministry amen that we
[1:17:56] fully although the prophet of God you
[1:17:59] know the pastor is humble but not too
[1:18:02] humble he
[1:18:03] said amen of course we know where we are
[1:18:06] standing so in in the Old Testament we
[1:18:09] have
[1:18:10] morai amen and I look look at this
[1:18:12] scripture in the in in verse chapter 2:
[1:18:15] 11 and morai walked every day before the
[1:18:17] court of the women's house to know how
[1:18:20] Esther
[1:18:21] did and what should become of her
[1:18:27] amen so Mori types the
[1:18:30] prophet and he gave message to
[1:18:34] Esther not only doctrines not just the
[1:18:38] Deep teachings of the message that we
[1:18:40] found here but the purpose is what
[1:18:44] should become of
[1:18:50] her the message is deep no doubt about
[1:18:53] that amen amen but the real depth of the
[1:18:57] message is that it can produce the
[1:19:01] character of Christ in the
[1:19:04] bright amen so this line tells a lot and
[1:19:07] he said so morai every day he's checking
[1:19:11] you know he's checking and and and and
[1:19:13] and uh asking about uh about Esther uh
[1:19:17] because his message was to produce a
[1:19:21] queen amen what should become of her
[1:19:25] amen so the bride uh uh uh uh uh when
[1:19:30] the Lord Jesus Christ comes back he's
[1:19:31] not going to take just any church but
[1:19:33] he's going back for his bride so this
[1:19:37] message gives us the details of what
[1:19:40] should become of us like the Bride of
[1:19:43] the Lord Jesus Christ amen now so you
[1:19:47] see uh in in that portion where where I
[1:19:50] said I see you know both both of them
[1:19:53] were being loosed in in uh in verses 1
[1:19:58] to3 let's read in verse two now ye shall
[1:20:01] find an ass tied and cult with her loose
[1:20:03] them and bring them unto me and if any
[1:20:05] man say o unto you he shall say the Lord
[1:20:07] that need of them and straight way he
[1:20:10] will send them amen so both of them were
[1:20:15] released now imagine that 2,000 years
[1:20:19] ago both of them were loosed
[1:20:23] but Jesus Took only one Beast to ride
[1:20:28] on but the young amen because the poanas
[1:20:32] is a younger Beast a younger one and
[1:20:36] this younger was just
[1:20:40] watching amen
[1:20:43] watching so when when when he we was
[1:20:47] they were they they entered into the
[1:20:49] city but the young Beast was already
[1:20:51] there because both of them were being
[1:20:54] loosed now what I'm trying to show this
[1:20:56] brothers and
[1:20:59] sisters that at that time there were
[1:21:02] already two
[1:21:04] generations of ministry inspiration amen
[1:21:09] the the the the the ass where Jesus
[1:21:12] rode and the younger one who was just
[1:21:16] following wherever it
[1:21:19] went and I believe it's the same thing
[1:21:21] today we don't have any other message
[1:21:25] this is the message where we are being
[1:21:28] brought back to the original faith of
[1:21:31] the
[1:21:32] Apostles now what I'm saying this
[1:21:34] morning that 2,000 years ago the
[1:21:37] ministry the
[1:21:39] portion of that Beast that Jesus rode
[1:21:43] has been done already amen but there is
[1:21:46] one
[1:21:48] following and that young ass 2,000 years
[1:21:52] ago is no longer young
[1:21:55] today it's
[1:21:57] here the anointing the inspiration the
[1:22:01] ministry and that is what the Lord Jesus
[1:22:05] Christ amen will take and write this
[1:22:08] Trail
[1:22:12] again amen hallelujah not brother randam
[1:22:16] rising from the dead amen I'm sorry amen
[1:22:19] but it must be amen the beast in the
[1:22:23] right that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:22:26] riding once again in this generation
[1:22:30] that we're living in it's no longer
[1:22:32] young this time is fully matured it has
[1:22:35] passed through various experiences that
[1:22:38] it is ready to Bear the burden amen and
[1:22:43] and and the Beast is a that that that
[1:22:45] ass is a burden Bearer that's why we are
[1:22:47] bearing the burden amen of this message
[1:22:51] to bring it to the life last lap of this
[1:22:54] journey brothers and sisters so we need
[1:22:57] to take our position amen so every time
[1:23:00] there is a transition that we see we saw
[1:23:02] that in uh we saw that in Elijah amen
[1:23:06] and we saw that in Elisha all right so
[1:23:09] there are two generation we saw that in
[1:23:10] Moses and we saw we saw that in in
[1:23:13] Joshua am mean so it's the same thing
[1:23:15] today so we see this two generations
[1:23:18] amen and now today is the Fulfillment
[1:23:21] and remember this in the simple EX in
[1:23:24] the simple illustration brother bam said
[1:23:28] watch what we doen because there are
[1:23:31] always eyes
[1:23:33] watching amen because we create an
[1:23:37] influence that's why our faith in in in
[1:23:39] the message the ministry of Malachi 4 is
[1:23:42] to restore our faith back amen because
[1:23:45] we have to watch Elisha asked something
[1:23:48] from Elijah when when when Elijah said
[1:23:50] what do you want and he said I want want
[1:23:52] a double portion of what you have Elijah
[1:23:55] said you're asking for something that is
[1:23:57] too much too much for me but he said you
[1:24:02] keep an eye amen don't lose your
[1:24:06] sight because he said but when I'm said
[1:24:10] amen uh uh uh elishah had to see Elijah
[1:24:16] all the time until amen he saw him leave
[1:24:21] the sin
[1:24:23] right you ask for something that is hard
[1:24:26] but he said if thou see me
[1:24:29] go amen you shall have what you're
[1:24:33] asking for and I believe that's that's
[1:24:37] something that other
[1:24:43] people are failing to see they have seen
[1:24:46] the coming of the
[1:24:49] Prophet but they have not seen him go
[1:24:53] we're not saying brother brandham is no
[1:24:55] longer part of this ministry he is
[1:24:58] because we believe the message of God
[1:25:01] that passes through him but we believe
[1:25:04] in the
[1:25:05] changing of the dispensation the
[1:25:08] changing of times that even during the
[1:25:11] time of brother Branham he show us a
[1:25:14] perfect example amen remember the time
[1:25:17] when Haiti right approached brother
[1:25:19] Brenham and brother Brenham heard a
[1:25:22] message from the from the Lord amen that
[1:25:25] that the Lord was so pleased with that
[1:25:27] woman and he said whatever that woman
[1:25:29] say it will come to pass amen so you see
[1:25:34] uh that was just an actual situation but
[1:25:37] we see spiritual connotation on that
[1:25:40] that that that the prophet that that in
[1:25:42] that event in that significant moment
[1:25:45] there was something a change from the
[1:25:48] prophet to the bride amen uh brother
[1:25:52] said the Lord spoke Amen in the same
[1:25:54] voice that the same voice that spoke
[1:25:56] those squirrels amen that H uh the same
[1:25:59] voice that yeah that brought back the
[1:26:01] life of that little fish was the same
[1:26:04] voice who spoke to brother branam and he
[1:26:06] knew the Lord will do something amen and
[1:26:08] he he spoke to the bride and he said
[1:26:12] sister hat right amen representing the
[1:26:14] bride amen he said the Lord spoke and
[1:26:17] and he said whatever you say whatever
[1:26:21] you speak
[1:26:22] amen not just the prophet possessing the
[1:26:25] third pool Ministry the third pool
[1:26:28] manifestation but he was showing to us
[1:26:32] amen that at a certain level a certain
[1:26:35] condition of Faith a certain attitude
[1:26:38] character just like the character amen
[1:26:42] the desires the will of that mother amen
[1:26:46] and he said and and and and and sister
[1:26:49] was so innocent he said brother bam I
[1:26:50] don't know I don't know how how can you
[1:26:53] say it for me amen and but said no but
[1:26:58] the voice said whatever you say not
[1:27:01] whatever I say whatever you say so
[1:27:04] brother is placing the
[1:27:07] woman just like the bride placing in a
[1:27:11] position amen that not only HH H uh we
[1:27:15] know so
[1:27:17] much but the
[1:27:19] character amen and and and see this this
[1:27:22] woman said I don't know brother brandham
[1:27:24] can you say can you speak for me but
[1:27:27] brother BR said it's not what it says
[1:27:29] it's not the voice is not the vision
[1:27:32] amen but you say whatever you
[1:27:35] say and the prophet gave her a multiple
[1:27:41] choice you choose you're so poor you can
[1:27:46] ask for money and I was he was expecting
[1:27:50] bundles of dollars probably
[1:27:52] if she would have spoken
[1:27:55] that and you have a sick loved
[1:27:59] one right you may ask and right at that
[1:28:02] very moment they will see that loved one
[1:28:06] jump
[1:28:08] healed
[1:28:10] amen amen but the condition of that
[1:28:13] woman's
[1:28:14] heart is not for
[1:28:18] temporary amen manifestation he want
[1:28:22] something that is
[1:28:25] eternal amen hallelujah I believe we can
[1:28:28] see there amen that we we can speak the
[1:28:32] right thing if we have the right
[1:28:33] attitude the right character amen not
[1:28:36] what we know but what the Lord wants or
[1:28:39] desire amen and he she asked for
[1:28:42] something that is eternal I I want the
[1:28:45] salvation of my two sons and the lord
[1:28:48] gave it because that's what the the
[1:28:51] brides say oh I could imagine amen the
[1:28:54] position of the Bride today if we can
[1:28:56] only be in that position that the Lord
[1:28:59] is expecting us amen things will will
[1:29:02] will will will uh uh uh will come to
[1:29:05] pass right in our midst amen and we
[1:29:07] don't have to force everything amen
[1:29:10] sometimes we force you know people how
[1:29:12] can the bride is so the the bride is so
[1:29:14] disunified today many many Circles of
[1:29:17] Fellowship many uh comes circles so
[1:29:20] forth and so on we're not looking for a
[1:29:23] physical manifestation of unity amen God
[1:29:26] sees the invisible Union amen and so you
[1:29:30] come to think of that amen so now just
[1:29:33] we what we are seeing here what's
[1:29:35] happening in Israel right now amen
[1:29:37] before I flew to the uh to the states
[1:29:40] amen I have seen in the news amen how
[1:29:44] Israel was so
[1:29:46] disunified right amen people coming out
[1:29:49] on the streets amen complaining against
[1:29:52] uh uh their prime minister their
[1:29:54] government they were so divided if we
[1:29:56] look at it but something
[1:29:59] happened amen something happened amen an
[1:30:03] attack took place and
[1:30:06] now we have not seen Israel as un as
[1:30:10] unified as what we are seeing today even
[1:30:13] the opposition leader amen appealed the
[1:30:15] ruling party that they that they were
[1:30:18] willing to join Force amen and uh h h uh
[1:30:22] uh come up with something to represent
[1:30:24] only one nation Israel I believe the
[1:30:27] same thing amen the Bride of the Lord
[1:30:29] Jesus Christ will come to that spot
[1:30:32] we're not going to force it we have to
[1:30:34] do what little portion we have and we
[1:30:36] will come to that spot without even
[1:30:39] realizing it hallelujah amen so uh
[1:30:43] brother bham said you know amen uh we we
[1:30:46] we we we we
[1:30:48] Brams we
[1:30:50] fight he amen we fight in the backyard
[1:30:54] amen but when somebody throws Stone Amen
[1:30:58] on a on a roof you will see how the
[1:31:00] Brams react we are one and it's the same
[1:31:02] thing with the bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:04] Christ amen just do what you have to do
[1:31:07] let them do what they have to do amen
[1:31:09] but when the time comes amen when the
[1:31:12] pressure comes the true and genuine
[1:31:15] Unity will come into our existence
[1:31:18] Hallelujah and it's not one organization
[1:31:21] not one person ality not one particular
[1:31:23] Doctrine but it is God's love unifying
[1:31:26] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:31:29] so now it's the so you see so that's why
[1:31:32] we have to Be watchful of what we are
[1:31:34] doing anden brother Bram you know in
[1:31:36] this age brother brandham said you know
[1:31:38] that's why we have problem today many
[1:31:40] times you say we have he said he he he
[1:31:42] spoke about the children this
[1:31:44] delinquency he said it's not
[1:31:47] actually child
[1:31:49] delinquency amen but he said what what
[1:31:51] we need it's not juvenile delinquency
[1:31:54] it's parent delinquency it's because
[1:31:57] that the parents has neglected and a
[1:31:59] whole lot of us is the way the church
[1:32:01] will never preached what's the matter
[1:32:02] Brethren get back to the gospel preach
[1:32:05] all time Holiness and get into the
[1:32:07] church again we must have a standard
[1:32:10] amen amen he said we must have a
[1:32:14] standard amen we're not groping in
[1:32:16] darkness here in the message we have a
[1:32:19] standard we have a word to preach
[1:32:22] we have a message to live by amen and
[1:32:25] and and and so now and and you see not
[1:32:29] only parents delinquency but brother
[1:32:30] bham said there's also Pulpit
[1:32:32] delinquency
[1:32:34] sir amen you know this
[1:32:39] message pure message is our weapon Amen
[1:32:43] to be used for the enemy amen amen right
[1:32:48] we
[1:32:49] don't use our canons
[1:32:54] and
[1:32:56] shoot any other church right and we're
[1:33:00] not expecting other Church to shoot us
[1:33:03] amen message church I believe but it
[1:33:06] must start from the pulpit we need to
[1:33:09] strike the
[1:33:11] Devil head on Amen because brother
[1:33:14] Brenham said you know if we amen uh uh
[1:33:18] uh if we will fight you know the devil
[1:33:20] will not accept any effort anymore he
[1:33:23] will just sit down and rejoy and just
[1:33:26] watch amen but thank God I believe the
[1:33:28] Bride of today is advancing to the point
[1:33:31] amen that that that the word of the Lord
[1:33:34] is what is being delivered behind the
[1:33:36] pulpit amen it's not one Church against
[1:33:39] another church amen but this message
[1:33:43] amen you know sometimes people you know
[1:33:44] they know how to qu how to quote
[1:33:46] scriptures they know how to quote
[1:33:47] statements of the Prophet amen but you
[1:33:50] see when you you hear somebody uh uh you
[1:33:54] know uh quoting the scripture quoting
[1:33:57] the statement of the Prophet you know
[1:34:00] the pastor cannot cannot uh uh save you
[1:34:04] the church cannot save you amen we
[1:34:08] believe what brother Brandon where where
[1:34:09] he is coming from right but when you
[1:34:13] hear a person quoting that scripture and
[1:34:15] he is not going to
[1:34:17] church you know where he is coming from
[1:34:20] and you know where he is going
[1:34:23] to amen is misplaced amen but we should
[1:34:28] not miscot the the the scripture uh uh
[1:34:32] the statement of the Prophet we should
[1:34:34] take it as it is amen and we should take
[1:34:37] it amen for our benefit amen and for the
[1:34:41] benefit of the Brethren Hallelujah so
[1:34:44] now so as we are that's why you know
[1:34:47] when when uh when people I like this
[1:34:49] portion I remember the time you remember
[1:34:52] uh Elisha you know he went out in the he
[1:34:57] went out and those young
[1:35:00] children mocked him and said you
[1:35:04] baldheaded why didn't you go with the
[1:35:07] prophet ahead of you Elijah
[1:35:12] and I was reading this
[1:35:16] portion
[1:35:18] and let me read it he said now if any of
[1:35:22] them kids would said now if their father
[1:35:25] and mother had said now look children
[1:35:28] they say that Elijah was taken up now we
[1:35:30] don't know about that I don't know
[1:35:32] whether it's so or not but I tell you
[1:35:35] the best thing to do is just don't say
[1:35:37] nothing about it just go ahead when he
[1:35:40] passes we hear he's coming down through
[1:35:42] the city today going to have a street
[1:35:44] meeting up there if he does if you
[1:35:46] children on the road to school today
[1:35:48] meet him just say how do you do Reverend
[1:35:51] how do do you do sir or something like
[1:35:52] that but instead of that no doubt they'd
[1:35:55] been told at home or they heard Papa and
[1:35:59] Mama sat at the table and laughing one
[1:36:01] another saying what do you know they
[1:36:03] said that old Holy Roller was taken up
[1:36:05] did you ever believe anything like that
[1:36:07] and they said this little old baldheaded
[1:36:09] fellow just as baldheaded as a pumpkin
[1:36:11] up there he ain't over about 35 years
[1:36:14] old and here he's coming down through
[1:36:16] there and said he's going to hold the
[1:36:18] street meeting expect us amen believe
[1:36:21] such nonsense as that why he's not
[1:36:23] nothing but a little mockery that's all
[1:36:25] his cuz he won't come to our churches
[1:36:27] just like Elijah was probably some kind
[1:36:30] of a witchcraft amen hoax like Elijah
[1:36:33] they didn't believe him so the little
[1:36:36] children was taught that at
[1:36:40] home amen so those children marked and
[1:36:46] insulted the prophet as baldheaded and
[1:36:49] they disrespect not just the man but the
[1:36:53] office the anointing that was upon him
[1:36:57] and the prophet of God said they did
[1:36:59] that they were innocent but they did
[1:37:02] that because their
[1:37:05] parents probably during their breakfast
[1:37:08] table they talk about the
[1:37:12] pastor if they cannot talk about the
[1:37:14] pastor they talk about the wife of the
[1:37:16] pastor the children of the pastor the
[1:37:20] deacons right I'm not saying that's
[1:37:22] happening here amen but I'm saying
[1:37:25] people disrespect the office the
[1:37:28] children do not respect the office it
[1:37:31] didn't come from
[1:37:33] them amen so the reason brother bam say
[1:37:36] these things amen that we have uh Rebel
[1:37:39] Spirits there Rebel children there they
[1:37:42] don't respect the pulpit they don't
[1:37:44] respect the offices the PIP Ministry
[1:37:46] because there are disrespectful parents
[1:37:49] at home yeah and these children were
[1:37:54] watching hearing what they're
[1:37:56] saying amen and so this kids are just
[1:38:00] right there and they suffer amen being
[1:38:03] being uh uh what did and he turned and
[1:38:06] and and they say the there were two

[1:41:06] spirit of the Lord it will bring more
[1:41:10] results and it will produce a genuine
[1:41:13] Revival because we see genine Revival is
[1:41:18] sin when the word is being fulfilled in
[1:41:22] our

[1:42:06] promised in the Garden of Eden the devil
[1:42:08] has constantly tried to destroy that
[1:42:09] seed and the death of Abel and the
[1:42:11] coming of Seth was just a death burial
[1:42:14] and resurrection of Christ that seed
[1:42:16] must continue and he tried to destroy it
[1:42:19] it is always the desire of the devil to
[1:42:23] destroy the seed amen want to put a stop
[1:42:27] on that now during that time I can hear
[1:42:30] him say Satan come here his boss now

[1:43:04] kick I could imagine like

[1:43:11] was a healthy cake amen so Satan felt
[1:43:14] that amen uh and said now here is starts

[1:43:20] there's another group listen where is
[1:43:22] job where Abraham where are they at
[1:43:25] where those fellows that trust this
[1:43:27] God's word has he forgotten them did
[1:43:29] that annihilate them was that all of it
[1:43:32] never never God has to keep his word I
[1:43:34] can see him let's take the little peep
[1:43:37] into paradise and look over and I see
[1:43:39] Sarah and Abraham walking around there
[1:43:42] and after a while amen something on the
[1:43:44] door Abraham goes and opens the door say
[1:43:46] honey come here look here look here
[1:43:48] that's the very same one that stood with
[1:43:52] me under the oak that day amen
[1:43:56] hallelujah so he went down amen the Lord
[1:43:59] Jesus Christ came down after his death
[1:44:02] in amen uh he he came down he who
[1:44:05] ascended up is the same down the same
[1:44:07] that came down when he came down
[1:44:12] now there was a beginning of something
[1:44:16] yes right there in hell right there in
[1:44:18] Paradise amen he said now just that over
[1:44:21] Abraham just then I see Daniel look over
[1:44:24] his shoulder and say that's the rock
[1:44:26] that was shed out of the mountain just a
[1:44:28] certain as I am standing here I see job
[1:44:31] that's my redeemer and I said I knew
[1:44:32] that live and someday stand upon the
[1:44:34] Earth my body may not be but a little
[1:44:37] Spoonful Of Ashes but in 15 minutes from
[1:44:40] now amen I'll be in it again Ezekiel
[1:44:44] looks over the top and said I seen that
[1:44:46] same person as a whe in the middle of
[1:44:49] the wheel turning way up up in the
[1:44:50] middle of the air oh my then up comes
[1:44:53] Enoch Enoch said I saw him coming with
[1:44:56] 10,000 of his Saints to execute judgment
[1:44:58] there was the Old Testament Saints
[1:45:00] waiting amen sure they were under the
[1:45:03] atonement of blood they could not go in
[1:45:05] the presence of God of Heaven because
[1:45:07] goat and sheep blood could not take away
[1:45:10] sin but he said my brethren I am the one
[1:45:13] that you think I am I am the seed of the
[1:45:15] woman I am the son of David I am the Son
[1:45:17] of God I am the Virgin born one BL my
[1:45:20] blood has atoned for it you waited under
[1:45:22] the blood of sheep and goats but now
[1:45:25] amen he said but now my blood atones
[1:45:29] amen and you're
[1:45:34] free amen hallelujah so he he lose the
[1:45:40] natural eyes amen make use of them amen
[1:45:44] but these people who stood even under
[1:45:47] the the the the the shed blood of
[1:45:49] animals and the Old Testament
[1:45:51] that they were waiting for the
[1:45:52] Fulfillment of the prophecy they died
[1:45:56] believing the message in their day
[1:45:59] Hallelujah many have went ahead of us
[1:46:02] but they died believing the message of
[1:46:04] the hour with the same expectation amen
[1:46:07] so when he came down he said you are
[1:46:10] free yes sir amen and so because they
[1:46:13] are free there was a Revival in hell
[1:46:17] they were rejoicing and because of that
[1:46:20] presence because of that rejoicing hell
[1:46:23] death could not hold him that's why in
[1:46:25] Matthew chapter 27 after his
[1:46:27] resurrection many graves were opened
[1:46:31] Hallelujah many graves were opened
[1:46:34] because the souls that were been held in
[1:46:37] the Old Testament now we being loosed
[1:46:41] amen hallelujah and they were moved into
[1:46:43] another uh another place Hallelujah so
[1:46:47] how much more today that we have heard
[1:46:50] the liberating message of the hour amen
[1:46:54] thank you Lord because we have heard the
[1:46:56] liberating message of the hour and you

[1:47:01] if the sun therefore shall make you free
[1:47:03] ye shall be free in death amen let me
[1:47:07] close with this amen if the son
[1:47:10] therefore shall make you free ye shall
[1:47:13] be free indeed amen hallelujah I thank
[1:47:16] God I am free I thank God I am free as
[1:47:19] we call on our
[1:47:21] musicians amen this afternoon amen now
[1:47:24] that us was for a long
[1:47:27] time they were been
[1:47:33] tied in this illustration I I remember
[1:47:36] one illustration you know there is a an
[1:47:39] ass that's being tied for a long
[1:47:42] time and his owner just gave him
[1:47:47] probably 3 m away from the post and he
[1:47:51] was tied there almost all his life and
[1:47:55] so he just walked and he cannot go
[1:47:58] farther than 3 m and he will go around
[1:48:01] that post and then later tie himself his
[1:48:05] neck is on the
[1:48:07] post and then he will go another
[1:48:10] Direction but he can go as far as 3 m
[1:48:13] only and then he go back almost all his
[1:48:17] life he spend being tied in that post
[1:48:21] but one
[1:48:22] day a concerned
[1:48:25] individual
[1:48:27] amen Cut the
[1:48:30] Rope he's
[1:48:34] free he didn't realize it
[1:48:37] immediately amen but because he's been
[1:48:40] tied for so long a time in that post 3
[1:48:43] MERS away from the
[1:48:46] post it was cut but he was just run
[1:48:50] running 3
[1:48:51] m but he had marked a circle 3 m away
[1:48:56] and then suddenly he stepped out of
[1:48:59] that and he realized he can go
[1:49:03] further amen he can go further and then
[1:49:07] he he he he moved further and he
[1:49:10] realized he's really free and he's
[1:49:13] totally free and he could go
[1:49:15] further amen that's the same thing with
[1:49:18] us Satan try to convince us that we are
[1:49:22] being bound we are under his control and
[1:49:25] that's why we cannot be fully used
[1:49:29] because we are being tied with something
[1:49:32] we're being tied with our past
[1:49:35] experiences we we've been being tied
[1:49:38] with our old
[1:49:41] life we feel you know we condemn
[1:49:45] ourselves because of our
[1:49:48] past sometimes we have our own
[1:49:50] prejudices and biases we're being tied
[1:49:53] to that amen people could not move
[1:49:57] on because they have feed themselves
[1:50:01] with lots of bitterness and negative
[1:50:04] things amen but let me tell you
[1:50:08] today our savior the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:12] the son of man has cut us people could
[1:50:14] not go amen uh uh uh uh just one
[1:50:21] day it happened to us you know because
[1:50:24] of this message of the hour we rejoice
[1:50:27] when we when we were being loosed when
[1:50:30] we are being baptized in the name of the
[1:50:32] Lord Jesus Christ because baptism in the
[1:50:35] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:37] Christ
[1:50:38] repentance is a part of it amen so when
[1:50:42] we repented amen so we we are being
[1:50:45] released by our all sins amen but as we
[1:50:49] keep on moving we go further from that
[1:50:53] post where we being tied
[1:50:56] almost our life amen so we got we got
[1:51:01] extended more later on we saw it's not
[1:51:04] just baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:51:06] Jesus Christ amen we've seen more amen

[1:51:11] Testament we've seen what happened in

[1:51:16] loose and later on the book amen the the
[1:51:19] the the seven gold candlesticks amen all
[1:51:21] these symbols in the Bible we're being
[1:51:23] we are being tied tied with all these
[1:51:26] symbols but now it's being open to us
[1:51:28] hallelujah more Revelation is coming up
[1:51:31] and it's releasing more releasing more
[1:51:34] Hallelujah and the more we we hear more
[1:51:36] of this message we got loose amen the
[1:51:39] word has restored us back to the fate of
[1:51:41] our fathers amen amen we we we went
[1:51:45] further amen hallelujah amen we went
[1:51:48] back to the fate of our fathers the
[1:51:50] original teachings the basic teachings
[1:51:52] of the Apostles but when we realize as
[1:51:55] we enjoy more freedom amen amen our
[1:51:58] Revelation did not stop in the time of
[1:52:00] the Apostles it went back to the Garden
[1:52:03] of Eden in Genesis Hallelujah where the
[1:52:07] abstract deed amen was loosed by Adam
[1:52:11] and now it's being restored and we can
[1:52:13] live we can enjoy with such a blessing
[1:52:17] Hallelujah and even go beyond that yes

[1:52:23] the Apostles not just restored back amen
[1:52:27] our position just like our you know in

[1:58:11] I was just thinking of Lazarus when
[1:58:14] Lazarus died and they put him in a tomb
[1:58:17] and they rolled a big Rock Amen over it
[1:58:20] and they they had him sealed away in
[1:58:22] death amen but Jesus knew he just slept
[1:58:26] he knew he wasn't dead because Saints
[1:58:27] can't
[1:58:28] die so he comes to the gravide and and
[1:58:32] he tells him to roll the stone away
[1:58:33] whatever false understanding whatever
[1:58:35] false Doctrine has sealed Us in to the
[1:58:38] to the tomb of denominationalism and
[1:58:40] man's idea roll that away and then the
[1:58:43] voice of God is going to call our name
[1:58:45] amen how does he how does he call our
[1:58:47] name as he reveals the book He's Calling
[1:58:48] our name name and he's calling for us to
[1:58:51] come forth amen so this is the day we
[1:58:54] live in amen the stone has been rolled
[1:58:56] away amen we've come out of the deadness
[1:58:58] and the deadness of denominationalism
[1:59:01] why cuz he called our name but there was
[1:59:03] another step amen he said loose him from
[1:59:07] the bed clothes amen why because they
[1:59:09] wrapped him for death they didn't wrap
[1:59:11] him for life they wrapped him in man's
[1:59:13] ideas they wrapped him in all kinds of
[1:59:15] History they wrapped him to be dead they
[1:59:17] bound him for death and put him in the
[1:59:19] tomb but now the word has opened the
[1:59:21] tomb the voice of the Lord has called
[1:59:23] our name amen but there's another step
[1:59:26] oh we got to be loose from the old
[1:59:28] thinking we've got to be loosed from the
[1:59:29] old teaching loose us and let us go so
[1:59:32] that we can be a testimony of the
[1:59:34] resurrection of Jesus Christ the
[1:59:36] resurrection power that's in this
[1:59:39] word amen loose us oh God I need loose
[1:59:43] from my old thinking I need loose from
[1:59:45] my own Traditions I need loose from my
[1:59:47] past I need loose from my mist Stakes I
[1:59:49] need loose from everything that they
[1:59:51] wound around me for
[1:59:53] death amen because Lazarus became such a
[1:59:56] testimony of the resurrection power of
[1:59:58] Jesus Christ now not only did they want
[2:00:00] to kill Jesus they had to kill Lazarus
[2:00:02] cuz his life testified of the power of
[2:00:05] the
[2:00:08] word I want to have that kind of loosing
[2:00:11] so that my life is such a testimony of
[2:00:13] the resurrection power of Jesus Christ
[2:00:15] amen that I don't have just a problem
[2:00:17] with the word I got a problem with this
[2:00:19] one that was
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:26] resurrected we've been loosed in this
[2:00:29] generation and you know I don't know
[2:00:31] about you but I don't want to be a
[2:00:32] Lazarus who's walking around still
[2:00:34] dragging an old piece of death
