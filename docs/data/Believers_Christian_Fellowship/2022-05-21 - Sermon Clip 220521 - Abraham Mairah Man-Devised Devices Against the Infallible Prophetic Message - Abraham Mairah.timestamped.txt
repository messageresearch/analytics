[0:58] so the package was mine
[1:02] so elijah was a servant to bring me
[1:06] the message
[1:08] it wasn't his
[1:10] liver believe william branham aside
[1:13] that man is his innocent
[1:15] that that guy that is thing of god is
[1:19] innocent leave god his thing aside
[1:23] therefore that holy thing that he shall
[1:26] be born of thee shall be called the son
[1:29] of god so it was a thing being used of
[1:33] god to redeem you and me
[1:37] he's innocent do you know that he wanted
[1:40] also to smoke when he was challenged by
[1:42] a woman

[1:47] but he wanted to smoke
[1:50] and then whoosh
[1:54] he couldn't do what he wanted to do even
[1:57] he couldn't he wanted to take a whiskey
[2:00] he couldn't drink
[2:01] he was a prisoner he wanted to break the
[2:04] word he couldn't break it and god said
[2:08] why because there is a work for you to
[2:10] do
[2:11] when you shall be older and the worker
[2:14] was to receive
[2:17] the message for me
[2:20] so i am standing here today in the
[2:21] defense of william branham leave that
[2:23] man alone
[2:25] let him rest in peace he has done his
[2:28] work

[2:44] about rupture talk about going home talk
[2:47] about new jerusalem talk about millennia
