[0:00] jesus in the
[0:02] book of revelation chapter one
[0:05] he introduce himself and say i am alpha
[0:09] i am omega the beginning and the end
[0:15] is that right
[0:16] which was which is which was which to
[0:20] come
[0:22] that was the introduction
[0:25] it was introducing divinity
[0:29] every denomination will tell you that's
[0:32] jesus
[0:34] when he introduced himself in revelation
[0:36] chapter one
[0:38] everyone believes that
[0:41] then we make
[0:42] another step
[0:45] we realize that they are not three
[0:48] people persons in
[0:51] god
[0:53] that is the only one you say i am the
[0:56] alpha and the omega and all the message
[0:59] believers say amen
[1:03] i introduce
[1:05] why is he introducing himself again in
[1:08] chapter four
[1:11] are you with me
[1:13] before you introduce himself again
[1:16] it brings john to go higher
[1:21] so as john goes higher he sees a door
[1:26] and there
[1:28] he started describing what was going on
[1:31] there
[1:32] i will say to you john received a
[1:36] greater
[1:37] revelation of the deity of christ
[1:42] that door
[1:44] is the revelation of the deity of jesus
[1:48] christ but a greater revelation
[1:53] now
[1:54] he knows
[1:55] who actually
[1:58] is
[1:59] christ
[2:03] amen
[2:09] the first revelation is the deity the
[2:12] supreme deity of jesus christ
[2:15] that said
[2:16] but why does he
[2:19] call john again and introduce himself
[2:23] again
[2:24] is giving john a greater revelation of
[2:28] actually
[2:30] the deity
[2:31] okay the deity
[2:33] was in the father the deity went in the
[2:37] sun
[2:38] but the deity has come down in human
[2:43] beings
[2:44] and that's the revelation
[2:47] and only through that
[2:49] you got into the door
[2:52] otherwise it is a some back door
[2:56] but for his children they receive the
[2:58] fullness of that revelation about who
[3:02] christ is
