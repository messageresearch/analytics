[0:00] Because the law of return was every
[0:01] seven years if a man had sold himself a
[0:03] bond slave because he had debts he could
[0:05] not pay and he needed money he could
[0:07] sell himself in as a bond slave to pay
[0:09] off his debts. But at the end of seven
[0:12] years when the trumpet would blow, he
[0:14] could go free.
[0:17] Why could he go free? He could go free
[0:19] because God says when the trumpet blows,
[0:21] you can go free.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason. He didn't have
[0:24] to pay any money. He didn't have to get
[0:26] a ransom. He didn't have to speak for
[0:28] him. He didn't need a letter from the
[0:29] high priest. Amen. The law was written
[0:32] because this is grace. If you mess up
[0:34] and you don't manage your affairs or you
[0:36] fall into trouble or you do something
[0:38] foolish and you have to sell yourself as
[0:40] a bond slave, there's a period of grace
[0:42] coming when you hear the trumpet. That's
[0:44] grace to you. You can go back. Amen. Not
[0:47] because you straightened up your act or
[0:49] you became nice. Are you
[0:52] &gt;&gt; just because
[0:55] &gt;&gt; then at the end of seven Sabbaths 49
[0:57] years at the end of that there's a 50th
[0:59] year. The 50th year is the Jubilee year.
[1:01] The Jubilee year, Amen, returns all the
[1:04] land of your inheritance. So if you got
[1:06] in financial trouble and you sold your
[1:09] land off, Amen, that land can only be
[1:11] removed from you for a certain period of
[1:13] time. But when the Jubilee call came,
[1:16] when the trumpet sounded, you could go
[1:18] back and take your land back.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; And you didn't have to pay a dime for
[1:23] it. You didn't have to do work for it.
[1:26] You didn't have to do anything. All you
[1:27] had to do was walk back into it because
[1:29] it was yours.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; What is this? This is grace that's
[1:33] embedded in the law.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that land was given to them
[1:37] without effort, without merit, without
[1:39] money, without price. God says, "This is
[1:42] my land and I give it to you as an
[1:44] inheritance."
[1:45] &gt;&gt; So each of their fathers when they were
[1:47] given a portion of land, how much did
[1:49] they pay for that portion of land when
[1:52] it was divided out by Joshua and he and
[1:54] he gave each one a certain portion? What
[1:56] did they pay for it?
[1:58] &gt;&gt; How did they earn it? Nothing. God gave
[2:00] it to him freely. That land was grace.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Then they would do something themselves,
[2:06] their own act that would remove them
[2:08] from God's grace. But in God's grace, he
[2:10] had a fail safe. You're never going to
[2:12] be permanently removed from my grace.
[2:15] You can never be permanently removed
[2:17] from the grace of God.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; And he laid the picture in the Old
[2:21] Testament so we could learn something.
[2:23] There is no way, no matter what you do
[2:25] or how vile you are or many mistakes you
[2:28] make, you can get separated from your
[2:29] inheritance. You can be sold into
[2:31] slavery of addiction, sold into slavery
[2:33] of finance, sold into all kinds of
[2:35] slavery that you do yourself. But praise
[2:38] God, if you ever hear that Jubilee
[2:40] trumpet, that's grace to bring you back
[2:42] to your right position, back to your
[2:45] original, which was your original grace.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; Why were they freeborn Israelites? What
[2:51] made them free men in their own land?
[2:53] They didn't pay for it. They didn't earn
[2:55] him. They didn't redeem themselves. God
[2:57] redeemed them out of the hand of
[2:59] Pharaoh. He purchased them with all the
[3:01] plagues.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; He paid the price. He redeemed them and
[3:07] brought them out. So they were freeborn
[3:10] by grace.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; You can't they can't ever say, "I'm
[3:16] fighting for my rights to be free. I'm a
[3:18] free man because my father's f No. Your
[3:21] fathers didn't fight for it."
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Remember the plagues? God fought for it.
[3:26] He stoned. He sent plagues. He turned
[3:29] the water to blood. He He He destroyed
[3:31] the firstborn. You didn't do a thing.
[3:33] You're freeborn by grace. Amen.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Then you have the land by grace.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; It's all by grace. So no matter how much
[3:42] you mess up, God is going to make sure
[3:44] you're never, his children are never
[3:46] permanently separated from his grace.
