========================================

the life will come up then the little stronger a little stronger March April May June July she's in the Harvest and you see the same sun shining today in January December that's up there bathing the snow and melting it down on the grain bringing it water it's the same Sun but what the wheat could not live in that same sunlight in June so brother Benham is showing us through the church ages it's been the word all along it's been the light of the manifested word all along it was the light it was the light from the first age to the seventh age it's the same line just like it's the same sunlight in January it's the same sunlight in June but what the difference is it's intensifying in its strength as the seed is maturing and so now the the seed that needs to live in a hot June July August light to come to full rapturing maturity amen that plant will not survive in that stage in January it can't live it'll die so that's why if we come to the very end of time when East has met West again when the gospels went through three pulls it's come to the West it can't live in the light of a previous age it'll die it has to have the full power of the final light to bring it to full rapturing maturity that's why even today we can never live in the past we can't live in one we can't just live in the first and second pool brother benham's Ministry but the third pool amen brought Christ to us Amen in brine form and we can't even live on our experience from yesterday we have to have fresh sunlight today we have to walk in the light as Christ is unfolding himself in US it can't be just what happened 50 years ago it's got to be what's happening today we can never stop staying in the present tense truth and staying in the sun there's no time for us to stop and say wasn't that a beautiful light that shone it's got to be a beautiful light that's shining now to keep bringing us into full full maturity into the full light
