perceive all that you have and may you be glorified in all that we say and do in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all this morning if you could turn with me in your Bibles to Genesis 32 we'll read a scripture before we're seated I also want to remind everybody that we have communion and feet washing this afternoon so we'll meet back here this afternoon for that when I read Genesis chapter 32 let's read one verse while we're standing Genesis chapter 32 and verse 30. and Jacob called the name of the place pineal for I have seen God face to face in my life is preserved amen God bless you as you take your seats man we're going to take this for a subject today Lord willing and speak on pineal and that'll be our title pineal but before we do that I want to make a couple of announcements about the holiday schedule coming up uh Christmas falls on a Sunday this year and when that happened six years ago 2016 we had an evening service and and it worked out quite well and and so I thought that we'd probably just keep the same format and do the same thing but I've come to find out that it's actually not working well for a lot of the congregations so we're going to change it back to our regular Sunday morning service time at 10 30. so on Christmas day we're going to have a regular a regular time our regular service at 10 30 in the morning but there'll be no Sunday school some of the teachers won't be available so I'm I'm sorry for that schedule change it came out on the schedule at 4 pm and then I I heard word that it was going to affect a lot of people and and so I talked to the deacons and it felt like having in the morning probably will work the best for my most people and that being said this is not that this is that we're having a service at regular time but we understand if you have obligations you have things that you're doing you have family gatherings there's some people that only see some of their family one time a year there's some things that you have to do so we understand that that's if you're available and you can make it please don't feel obligated but we're going to have the service here for those who are able to make it also New Year's Day falls on a Sunday as well one week later so we will not be having a watch Night Service this year just our regular Sunday morning service on New Year's Day and we won't have communion that day we'll we'll postpone until February and pick up the regular schedule in February so that'll be those two Services Christmas Day at regular time and New Year's Day at regular time so if that inconveniences anybody I'm sorry God bless you we love you amen but we understand I mean there's some things there's some obligations some plans have been made made a long time in advance and some of them those plans with inconvenience a lot of other family members and those who won't understand and don't believe so do as the Lord leads you and do what you need to do and we all understand but we're going to have the service for those who are available and those who would like to gather amen so let's get back to our subject here on pineal we know the story well of Jacob and I was going back over the last week and I was just meditating on the things that were preached here during the Thanksgiving meters meetings from Brother Daniel and from Brother Alistair and I was meditating on this subject and I was thinking on brother alistair's service from Sunday morning and this just kept stirring in my heart so I started looking at it and I just wanted to share some things with you out of this and in verse 30 we read it said and Jacob called the name of the place Penny elf for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and and so to get background on the story we know that Jacob through his own uh satility his own uh ways of of deception had gotten the birthright and he had also gotten the blessing with the help of his mom and then Esau his brother hated him and despised him and wanted to kill him and he ran away and he ran to Heron and and and there he got two wives and a couple concubines and children and he was coming back into the land by the direction of God and brother van tells us you know he fell into trouble there he pulled tricks you know over his family on this side he pulled some tricks on Laban in that side and the tricks were catching up with him now he's in a place where he was stuck in between amen it was in between Esau who he had cheated Laban who he pulled some stunts with and Laban was coming after him and Esau was on this side and he got into a fix he got into a pickle and that's when God came to him I think it's so amazing that that God knows right where we're at amen we feel like sometimes things are out of control things sometimes like ah we can't find our way sometimes out of the circumstances but God always knows exactly where we are and he knew where Jacob was he never lost sight of Jacob it threw it on and we know Jacob had some things that he had to learn I want to back up to Genesis 28 and I just want to read a portion out of Genesis 28. this is as Jacob is fleeing he's running away from Esau he's going up to his uh his mother's family's place and and Syria and so this is uh we'll just read it here in Genesis 28 and verse 10. and Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Heron so he's leaving he's fleeing from the face of his song and he lighted upon a certain place and he tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascended and descended on him and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land wherein thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South and indeed in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and will bring thee again unto this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoke to thee of what a promise he's running away from Esau he had gotten the birthright he had gotten the blessing and he got them both through some trickery I mean he got him I mean it doesn't seem like the most upstanding way to get the the things that he has and it it seems to me like God would correct him and God come to him in a dream and would say how dare you do that to your brother and when he was in need and you took advantage of his need and how dare you do this with your father and all of these things but God that's not how God speaks to Jacob because the promises with Jacob Jacob is the seed amen God knows who he is Jacob doesn't fully understand who he is but God knows who he is and you think God would come down and chasing him and correct him he know God knows he's going to get us chastening he's going to go to laban's house and laban's going to pull a few stunts too amen so he's going to get what what he needs for correction but God is coming down to confirm the promise the promise is with you that which was the Abraham and that which with his Isaac that now is with you and he makes a promise he said thy seed it shall spread out from the West to the north to the South to the east he said I I want to read this again he said uh and behold verse 15 I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou ghost and will bring thee again to this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of God makes a promise to Jacob and that promise is solid and sure I will be with you wherever I will bring you back and I will confirm this word that I promised to you that's as solid as solid can be Jacob can get up from there and know everything is under control I'm going to be fine and God will keep his word but Jacob had to learn some things about God first and look at Jacob's answer as response when he wakes up verse 16. and Jacob awoke out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid and said how Dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of that city was called lose at the first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if look at this word if if God will be with me what do you mean if God already promised Jacob is still immature in his walk with God he's still he's not certain of God God come to him in dream and made this promise he wakes up and he says if God and and he knows listen Jacob in this place he knows the stories he knows the histories he knows his family history he knows about what God did for Abraham he knows about what God did for Isaac he knows the promise to Abraham he knows he's in line for that promise God this dream come according to the word of God to confirm to him that you're in the line I'm still gone I remember my promise and I will keep it and he wakes up and he says if God [Music] if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raim it to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God and this Stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee he is still making deals he is he has not lost his old nature his old thinking his own way he still is making a deal that that that that if God does this and if God keeps me and if God gives me bread and Raymond and if God brings me back in peace then the Lord will be my God and then this house this Stone I set up will be the house of God and I will give him a tenth if God you keep your deal I'll give you a tenth my goodness but you know this is so much the mentality of Christianity in our day I mean you you they may not say it this way this may not be the terms that are used if God will do this and if God will do that he'll be my God and I'll and I'll serve him with everything I have no that's not what they say it's when things don't go right what comes out of their mouth shows that they had the same mentality amen you ask him when did you lose confidence well I prayed and it didn't work or I went up for healing and it didn't work or I tried to live the message and it didn't work amen it shows this same exact mentality or the same mindset if God will do this then the Lord will be my God and I'll serve him and I'll give him a tithe because they walk away when it doesn't work they lose confidence when the prayer is not answered when they don't see the word working when they don't see things changing amen they walk away showing that they had Jacob's mentality about serving God if God will then I will but the the mentality has to change we have to come to the place in maturity where we meet God face to face and we know if God said he will he will amen it doesn't matter what it looks like it doesn't matter what I go through it doesn't matter how long it takes it doesn't matter the circumstance if God said he will he will and I'll stay right here until he does that's a total different chain that's a change that comes when we meet God face to face so before he had met God face to face god listen he he in in pineal he meets God he wrestles this is when he wrestles with the angel of the Lord amen and and we're going to get into that but before he come to that he was he was in the message he was in church he he was a grandson of Abraham a son of Isaac he saw the wells that were dug the altars that were made the worship the sacrifices the stories he knew about God calling his grandfather he knew about his father being the sacrificed and laid on the Altar and he knew the promise and they knew all of these things but yet he's got a he's got a uh uh a deal-making spirit with God oh I don't want to have a deal-making spirit with God God is God what he says is true amen I don't want to hinge anything that I'll do based off what he'll do amen I'm going to serve you with all my heart he's God Amen his word is true I'm not going to say if he will and if he will if he will then I'll bring a tithe then I'll come to church and then I'll serve God and then I'll believe the message and then I'll do this and then I'll and then I'll honor his word and then I'll no no no no no no that's that's an immature walk so that's where Jacob was on his way out and we know that he's got to get knocked around a little bit he he got he got to get deceived by his father-in-law and he was given the older daughter instead of the one that he desired and then he has to work an extra seven years for the one for the original deal and and all of these things and Laban changes his wages 10 times but he tries to trick Laban and get the best cattle and I mean he's just it's tis for Tat he's in trouble and and you know what he's a child of God he's seed of God the promises with him he has the birthright God's already said you're the one and wherever you go I'm with you in the middle of his trickery and all of his ups and downs and all of his deception God's still with him he's still a child of God and he's still the seed of God the chosen of God and the lineage and the promises are all still resting with him and it's amazing that that Jacob is is is is so confident he's so self-confident it seems like in this ability to to be a deceiver a supplanter that's his name I mean it worked with his brother and it worked with his father and now in laban's house Laban pulls one on him but then he's going to pull one on Laban and get the cattle and and all of this stuff and and then you know he goes to talk to his wives when it's time to leave the Lord tells him it's time to go and he talks to his wives and he says you know the the you know your father's changed my wages these 10 times and but the Lord has blessed me all the best cattle if he said ring straight the the best would be ring strict if he said spotted the best would be spotted and all came to me and and and the Lord blessed me and and Jacob is he's a supplanter amen he's gaining through whatever means he can gain not realizing that the reason he's got the best flocks is because of the blessing from his father Isaac when he stole the blessing and he says let the fat of the land and the corner of the land be upon you it wasn't all his little trickery that was working for him it was the blessing that the father gave you know sometimes we can be wise in ourselves we think we've done something in my hard work and my planning and and my this and my that and I've got a living and I've got a business and I've saved up money and look at the house I built and blah blah blah blah blah and you don't know it's the blessing that's on your life because of who you are it's not your wisdom it's not your strength it's not all the things that you've done it's not because you know I was faithful and loyal who made you faithful and loyal I advanced in work and I studied hard and then you know what I believe in doing the best if you put your hand to the plow amen then then put your hand to the plow and don't turn back whatever God gives you to do do it the best of your ability but understand it's not your ability that's getting you anywhere it's the grace of God [Applause] and so we we have a Jacob mentality When We're Young in the Lord and we've grown up maybe understanding Abraham and Isaac and living with them and but we still got this goofy self-confidence thinking I can do this and I can make a deal and I can work this and I can get you can't do anything and it's not you doing anything anyways amen the blessing of God is on your life if you were raised by Godly Parents who made sacrifices for this message and surrender it all to stay true to the word there's a blessing that's flowing out into your life it's not your studies it's not your ability it's not your hard work it is God pouring out a blessing on you and when you get too confident in all this self you're setting yourself up for a trap so Jacob all those blessings of Jacob God said I'll be with you wherever you go it wasn't Jacob it was God but he was looking to his ability he was with effort trying to gain trying to preserve himself trying to take care of himself when he didn't have to God said he would God already said he would take care of him and watch out for him and bring him back in peace so we understand this is where Jacob is this is his mentality this has been his life this is how he's coming back into the land and he's went through trouble and and Laban has troubled him and the sons of Laban have spoke against him and now he flees and it's not even straightforward in this conversation with labor and he sneaks out and takes everything and he runs away and Laban catches up with him and and God speaks to Laban and tells him don't touch him if it wasn't for that Jacob would have been in trouble all his little trickery wouldn't have helped him any all of his plans and all all of his strength and all of his abilities wouldn't have helped him many it was God who helped him it was God who went to labor and said don't touch him don't harm him don't do anything if it wasn't for that what was Jacob going to do amen so so this is how he's returning to the land now let's go back to chapter 32. and look at verse 9. Genesis 32 and verse 9. and Jacob said o God of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord which said unto me return unto thy country and do thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee I'm not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of the truth which thou has showed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over Jordan now I am become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with children so here's Esau returning to the land coming back into the promise in which he is the heir of and he's moving back into this but he gets word that Esau's coming with 400 men and now he's fearful when he cries out to God and he says oh god of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac amen it's wonderful that he knows the god of his father Abraham and the god of of Isaac but this God has got to become his God there's got to be a change in Jacob where it's not just amen the the god of My Father Abraham the god of my father Isaac The God Who delivered this and The God Who did many works and the God who worked in the ministry of brother Branham and God who works in this brother or that brother but there needs to be a realization that this is now my God Amen you're my God my God my personal God my father and so now he's asking for help because he's saying uh uh I fear Him deliver me from the hand of Esau for I fear him he's afraid of Esau because he comes into a situation that he cannot manipulate no deception is going to work what he's trying to do is he's trying the path of appeasement he's trying to send down droves and give gifts and and offerings unto Esau and he's trying to hide out and keep himself distance from Esau so that Esau will see though the droves and all the gifts and then he'll see the wives and then he'll see the children and then he'll see Jacob last and hopefully by then he'll be appeased and his wrath will be softened and he won't kill Jacob Jacob's terrified he's he's trying again to protect himself by appeasing his brother that's all he has is his own efforts now let's get get into this story a little deeper let's look at verse 13. and he launched there that same night he took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother 200 she goats and 20 he goes 200 U's and 20 Rams 30 milk milk camels with their Colts 40 kind and ten Bulls 20 she asses and tenfolds and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me but put a space between drove and drove and he commanded the foremost saying when Esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying who's art thou and whether goeth thou and whose are these before thee then Thou shalt say they be thy servant Jacobs it is a present unto my Lord Esau and behold also he is behind us and so commanded he the second and the third and all the following followed the drove saying on this manner shall ye speak unto Esau when you find him and say ye moreover Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us for he said I am I will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward I will see his face per Adventure he will accept will accept of me so went to present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two women servants and his 11 sons and passed over the fort at j-bog and he took them and sent them over the brook and said and sent over that he had and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint the hollow I mean if Jacob sty was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breakth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou thus asked after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over pinuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his time therefore the children of Israel eaten out of the sinu which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh until this day because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank so now we see he's a he's fearful and in the night he's in the company but in the night he's nervous and he gets up and he moves his wives and concubines in his children and they go across the forward and he's left all alone and when he's all by himself he has no more options he has no more tricks to play he has no more plan he has no more deception he has nothing and in that in that state when he's come to the end of his ability to the end of his means he's laid out the best plan he has but it's not a good plan there's no way of escape and that time a man comes and wrestles with him all night yes where did the man come from where did Jacob find him amen it was it was God Amen it was the angel of the Lord that came Amen to get a hold of Jacob and to change Jacob Amen in a time when Jacob was in need a time that Jacob was in distress when Jacob was alone when he had no other options and he had no other plans God came to him Jacob couldn't go to God God came to him it's so amazing that God is keeping his word and Jacob's saying if God but God there was no if with God there was never a possibility of an if with God God said I will do it and he will do it and when Jacob gets into this place where he needs God God comes on the scene oh if Jacob couldn't believe that from the beginning and stopped all the self-made plans and all the deception and all the trickery things might have went a lot easier for him but we know that was God's hand to train them but now he gets to this place where he's in desperation he's in need he he he he can't deliver himself and all of his skills and all of his abilities has come to not I tell you if you ever get in that place you're in a good place when you get to the spot where you cannot help yourself and all that you thought you were good at you're now ready to throw away have you ever been there where I thought I was good at this and I failed I thought I could do this and I failed in it I thought I maybe could preserve myself I thought maybe I could do something I thought maybe I could gain something and all of your efforts have failed I tell your friends you're in a good spot amen because when everything you can try has failed there is a promise in your life if you're a child of God that has no if attached to it if there's ever an if we put the if there God didn't Jacob put the if God did not put the if Jacob put the F amen and now Jacob he's wondering if God will keep it he's hoping that God will do it he he he wants God to do it and he says if if he knew God would do it he'd say when when God brings me back to this place I will when God not if so it shows there was a question in his mind and God I believe for all of his children wants to get the question out of our mind I think he wants us to get the if out of our vocabulary and get to the place where we know that he'll keep his word we don't know how we don't know what it will look like we don't know when we don't know the circumstances but we have to get to the place where we know that he will keep his promise and so now God as faithful as God always is when Jacob's at the end of his rope and Desperation all of a sudden a man appears where did he come from it was God coming to Jacob God came to his child because God is going to keep his word God knows exactly where you and I are he hasn't lost track of us it doesn't matter what trial you're in it doesn't matter the circumstances that are lined up God knows right where you are and he knows how to meet you and he meets Jacob and they start wrestling and and we've been through this before but I just want to remind you of a few things I believe that this may be just me you may not believe this way but I believe that angel could free himself from Jacob's grip I believe the angel of the Lord had power I believe the angel of the Lord was a supernatural amen Angel of the Lord that could deliver himself because when he wanted to he could touch the hollow of Jacob's thigh and the sin you shrank I mean what kind of power is that he just touches his thought he could have touched his head touched his eyes just shriveled him up and dropped him like a ball amen but he could he could shrivel up the sinew of his thigh amen but it said amen he says that that he could not Prevail over Jacob this is a different kind of prevailing amen it's not sheer strength it's not the power in Jacob's arms but there was something else in Jacob that that angel couldn't overcome there is something else in Jacob that could Prevail over the angel and it wasn't the muscles in his arms it wasn't the intellect in his mind but there was a sea Gene of God there was a part of God down in Jacob in that part of God could Prevail amen could get a hold of God Amen and actually amen hold on to God and not turn loose this this this Angel he when he when he saw that he could not Prevail he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh and then he says let me go and Jacob said I'll not let you go till you bless me and he asked him what his name is he asked for a blessing and the angel says what's your name and when he when he he says Jacob he says Thou shalt no more be called Jacob but Israel I'll read this out of the scriptures verse 28 thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed he's saying I'm changing your name because you've all your life been called a supplanter a Deceiver but you don't really know that you've got power with God you don't really know who you are Jacob didn't really know who he was he knew what lineage he was in he knew about the promise he knew who Abraham and Isaac were he knew what God had done in the past he even knew what God promised for him but he really didn't know who he was and now he gets in this in this match with an angel of the Lord and he's holding on because why is he holding on because he has no options he come in contact with something that he knew could help him how did he know this could help him I don't know how did he know this was the answer how did he know this was the solution I don't know how he knew all I know is he knew amen and he knew he could not let go so until this Angel blessed him Jacob think about it hey he's got other things on his mind and then just meeting this man and wrestling with his man in the night when he's by himself he's got Esau he's got his wife and his children across the brook he's got these droves and and the men servants and women servants and he's got presents going to meet Esau and Esau coming to kill him he thinks he's got all of this going on and he finds a man and decides to wrestle with him whenever he come in contact with God and flesh he knew this can deliver me he knew this manifestation of God can save me he knew this is the answer and he got a hold of it and he would not let go of it even though the angel said let me go he said I'll not let you go even though he Afflicted him in the battle and weakened him by touching the sinew of his thigh he still wouldn't turn him loose amen this is a man who's going beyond the if he's saying you've got to do it nobody else can do it he's not walking away saying if you bless me then I'll do this he's saying Now's the Time and I've got to have it something in my life has to change this is what brother Branham says in the message desperations he says Jacob cried like never before desperately called until he got a hold of God you know this this word pineal that he named this place means facing God he was facing God and I want to talk about that for a little bit today facing God but he had heard about God he had seen the sacrifices at the altar he had heard the testimonies he had heard God speak to him in a dream he had experienced certain things but now he was facing God and this time when he's facing God he's facing God Alone there's nobody else involved it's him and God said Jacob cried like never before desperately called until he got a hold of God and when he did he wrestled not for 15 minutes he wrestled to keep him in his soul think about that he pressured to keep him in his soul all night long and still he knew he didn't have the blessing and he was able to hold on until the blessing came he wrestled desperately until the blessing come then and we see until God came on the scene and then in despair I'll not let you go when he began to feel the blessing come down on him a lot of people say glory to God I got it now there you're deceived yeah somebody say oh I just feel so good brother man I went down there and prayed oh Shivers run over me and that might have been God I saw a great light before me that still might have been gone but that ain't what I'm talking about the Bible said in Hebrews the sixth chapter the rain falleth from the just and the unjust just the same now you take wheat and take weeds and put them in the field and the rain is actually set for the wheat but the rain falls on the weeds and the same as it does the wheat and the rain and the weeds is just as happy about the rain as the wheat is and it's the very same rain the very Holy Ghost can fall upon an unbeliever and make him act just exactly the same way a Believer acts but by their fruits they are known that's what I'm speaking that's the token and Jacob rather in desperation he said I know I field you you're here with me but I'm not going to let you go see Jacob wasn't just after the feeling he wasn't just after feeling the presence of God he needed something to change he wasn't just in the emotional part and he wasn't just in the feeling amen he said I know I failed you but I'm just not going to let you go he needed something more than to feel the sensation of the presence of God he needed to meet God face to face and stay there until something in him changed he said I'll read this again now I feel you I know I feel you you're here with me but I'm not going to let you go somebody sees it fine the first little sensation they get up and jump up and down and run up I don't say I got it I got it I got it oh no oh no Jacob stayed there until something happened that made him walk different made him a different person because that he stayed until that happened and and he was able the Bible said he held until he prevailed how can a man Prevail over God but you can do it you can do it a man can Prevail over God listen this is wonderful that the prophet's saying this a man can Prevail over God how with what strength with what might with what mind with with what speech how in the world is a human being going to Prevail over God it's not the human being amen there's something down inside that God responds to amen there's something inside that can hook on to God there's something inside that can cry to God and pull God into a into action right you say is that right brother that's right read the whole Bible amen there was something in a certain group of people that could reach out and hook into God and pull God into action Moses could do it when he stood in the Gap amen David could do it when he when he prayed over Israel amen that the plague would stop there was something in God's people amen that could Prevail over God it wasn't their strength it wasn't their mind it wasn't their abilities it wasn't their group amen there was something in them it wasn't them there's something in them and that something in them was a part of God and it was God getting a hold of God it was God hooking into God it was God turning the eye of God I said before I I preached the message here I don't even remember how long ago but I I talked about we dramatized you know the wrestling match between the angel of the Lord and and which is a manifestation of God Amen in this manifestation of God who's wrestling with Jacob and he's saying let me go but the angel doesn't want Jacob to let him go he would have been disappointed if Jacob would have turned loose and said okay go on your way amen listen it wasn't it wasn't that the angel amen came down to fight with Jacob because the angel wanted to be let go he wanted to leave he wanted to move on it was Jacob who wanted to get a hold of the angel but but God and this manifestation presented himself to Jacob and then when Jacob got a hold of him amen he says let me go and he says no I'll not let you go and and and when we're dramatizing that we were just saying let me go he may say it with a gravelly voice he may say it in Anger he may say Let Me Go amen but in the whole time he's saying don't let me go don't let me go because I'm here for your change I'm here for you I'm here to solve your problem I'm coming on the scene in this manifestation to free you from yourself to change your walk to change your life to deliver you he says he says let me go but the will of God is not for Jacob to let him go what was holding on it was God holding on to God so brother man said Jacob stayed there until something happened I wanna I wanna look at this um facing God for just a little bit because that's what this is what Jacob experienced he met God face to face and his life was preserved and he named the place pineal after that experience and let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 5. I just wanted to look at what does it mean to see God face to face because sometimes we get wrong ideas and we get our own ideas and we read something that our own imagination picks paints a picture and if I tell you that you need to meet God face to face what's the first thing that pops into your mind you need to you need to go out into the woods and you need to have a fasting prayer meeting until the pillar of fire comes down or until a visible manifestation and you grab a hold of that and you met God face to face but that's not always what it means and I want to I want to look at that here it could be many manifestations but let's just look at the Bible and look at the message in Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 2. Moses is now speaking he's recapping the history of Israel at this point they're getting ready to go in the promised land and he's reminding them of their Journey he said the Lord Our God made a covenant with us in Horeb the Lord may not this Covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day the Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire God came down and he met Israel face to face he said in verse 5 and I stood between the Lord and you at that time to show you the word of the Lord for you were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mound so here all of Israel meets God face to face but they never see a person [Music] they didn't see a similitude or a form of a man what they saw was a black smoke and a fire come down upon the mountain and what they heard was the voice of God Speak Out The Covenant the Commandments and when God showed up in that smoking Fire on the Mountain and the mountain shaked in the mountain quake and God began to speak directly to them and they could hear with their ears the words that he was saying that's when Moses says you met God face to face so face to face is not necessarily what we think of face to face like two humans meeting face to face God presented himself down in a manifestation and gave them the word and he met them face to face now let's go to Exodus 33. Exodus 33 and verse 9. I'm going to read quite a length of this because there's a certain thing that I really want to get to so we can understand verse 9 and it came to pass as Moses entered into the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of none a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle so here we have Moses going into the Tabernacle and it says here the Lord spake to Moses face to face as a man speaketh to his friend so I want to read on verse 12 and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou has not let me know whom thou will sin with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou has also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people what what is Moses doing here face to face with God he is contending with God what's he doing he is wrestling with God and he's trying to prevail why did he go out to the Tabernacle because this is after the children of Israel were caught in sin and revelry when Moses was 40 days in the mountain this is when he came down and broke the tables of stone and anger and the Levites joined to him and slew so many of them because they were caught in idolatry making golden calves and he took the Tabernacle and moved it outside of the camp and went out there and God had said I'll not take this people up into the land anymore and now Moses goes out to the Tabernacle outside the camp and he begins what's he doing he is wrestling with the Lord he is he's trying to Prevail over God to get God to change his mind what kind of person is Moses whatever was in Moses was in Jacob amen whatever was in Jacob was in Moses he said now for I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight verse 13 show me the way that I may Know Thee and I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and he said unto them if thou presence go not with me carry us not up thence he's saying if your presence doesn't go because because God had said I'll not take you up my presence won't be with the people I I won't take them up and he says if your presence will not be with me then don't take us up how is Moses speaking to God like this it's not Moses it's another part of God inside Moses talking to God can hook into God and can turn God's head amen and he said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us not a pins for wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found Grace in thy is it not and that thou goest with us so shall thou so shall we be separated and I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou has found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name my what whatever Jacob was able to do with the angel Moses is able to do with God says my presence won't be there I won't be in the camp I won't be in the midst and Moses says if you don't go with us don't take us up but go with us and remember your people and he says I'll do as you've spoken what an amazing sequence of events verse 18. and he said I beseech thee show me thy Glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and to I will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live but we read up here in verse 11 and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaks to his friend so when Moses was speaking to God face to face he never saw God's face because God he said Show Me Your Glory and he says no man can see my face and live so it's not what we think of we're talking face to face he was when it when you talk face to face with God you're in the very presence of God Amen you're you're he's in the presence of God speaking directly to God but it didn't mean that he saw a person there in the face of a person just like when God spoke face to face to Israel they didn't see the similitude of a man they saw smoking furnace of fire and they heard his voice so we we want to have right idea now let's go to First Corinthians 13. I want us to see that we can talk face to face to God we can come in contact with the Living God we can come into the presence of God and we can talk to God face to face in fact we must meet God personally there's no way we must come into a personal meeting with God himself in order to be changed we have to have the ability to meet him face to face but what mountain will you go to what stream will you stay by how long will you fast what prayer closet will you go into will you dig a cave will you go into your attic what will you do we have to find how to come into His presence and how to meet him face to face First Corinthians 13. verse 10. verse 9 for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly this word glass Darkly means we see through a mirror that's obscure it's a literal definition we see through a mirror that's obscure I'm looking in a mirror but it's obscure I can't see the image right all right but then when when that which is perfect has come then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth's Faith Hope in charity these three but the greatest of these is charity he's saying when that which is perfect has come now we're looking into the word amen like looking into a mirror Darkly or obscurely but when that which is perfect has come we're going to look in and we're going to have Clear Vision and we're going to see face to face what we're going to see we're going to look at the word we're going to see there's no obscurity on the word anymore and it'll be like looking in a mirror face to face this gets so this is so good but there's a few things I want to read to hear Brother Branham comes to questions and answers in 1964. he's in August of 1964. and there's a series of things that he hits on through this portion of questions and answers and so I'll just give you the paragraph numbers because he references back to the same thing a few times and and in paragraph 56 he says First Corinthians 13 says when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication so what is it brother man I'm saying when that was just perfect just come what is that which is perfect when the perfect interpretation of the word has come we have the perfect word then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen so then he goes down to paragraph 96 this is further down in questions and answers he says Paul said though I speak with tongue of men and angels do I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice though I understand all the mysteries of God though I give all my goods to the poor and all these things and have not charity I still am nothing I have faith that I can move mountains and so forth I'm still nothing then he said that which is in part will be done away with when that which is perfect has come or when that which is perfect is made known now he adds more to the statement when that which is perfect has come or when that which is perfect is made known now listen the way he says next now I've got a question on that I hope I get to it tonight about what happened when the seals opened he's tying this well it's just perfect has come Amen to that which is perfect being made known to the opening of the seals and he's tying them all together now he comes down to paragraph 164 and there's a question that's asked him and here's the question please explain First Corinthians 13 8-12 that's the portion we just read now that the perfect word is restored to the church are these verses fulfilled brother says now I think I just went through that didn't I and when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with Paul said though I speak with tongue of men and angels I do all these things but when that which is perfect has come now is there anything perfect but God I want you to see where he's going he's going to stay right in the same vein of thinking they've asked him now now that the word is restored are these verses fulfilled and he goes right into explaining it he says I've talked about that before we read Those portions he says when that which is perfect is come now is there anything perfect but God no sir is God the perfect the answer is yes in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word still God all right then that which is perfect has come that which is in part done away with what's he talking about he's talking about the opening of the word amen in the opening of the word that which is perfect is come or been made known amen that which is perfect is now revealed amen and that which is in part all the partial understanding and the denominational understanding it's done away with all of our wrong thinking is done away with but at the opening of the word that which is perfect has come and that's First Corinthians 13 and then that same portion it says now we're looking at a mirror Darkly but then when that which is perfect when the seals are open when the book is open and the third pull then we shall see face to face then we can come face to face with the word with the person of the word amen here's what brother remember says in God who is rich in Mercy I've heard a similar little story I hope it don't sound sacrilegious about a little duck being born under a hen one time I love brother Brown's little stories they're not sacrilegious to me this is the way brother Benjamin's Simplicity gets us to understand what he's been saying a little duck being born under him one time he couldn't understand a funny looking little fellow odd guy and he couldn't understand the dust and everything they were playing in the barnyard but one day the old hen led the little brood out behind the barn and got he got a smell of water well he took out towards that water as hard as he could go why he had never been on a pond before he had never been in the water but he was a duck to begin with only thing he had to do was come to himself that's the same thing the believer is there is something in him that when he meets God face to face he comes to himself well when he when he meets God face to face he comes to what he comes to himself I thought I came to God but when I come to God face to face in this open word I'm going to come to myself because now we're looking at a word we're looking in a mirror Darkly and not able to understand what we're seeing but at the opening of the seals then the clears up and we look in the mirror of the word we look into the person of the word and it's like looking face to face what face do you see when you look in the mirror what are you supposed to see when you see the person of Christ you're supposed to see that it's Christ in you the hope of glory what is the perfect coming of the perfect word and coming face to face with God's supposed to do it is supposed to give you your proper identification and that's exactly what happened to Jacob Jacob was Sir planter he was living as a supplanter acting like a sister planter surviving as a supplanter he was a church member but he was nominal in every way he had a certain level of understanding but there was only so much depth to his understanding and he was still wheeling and dealing and hoping that things would work out but when he come face to face with the manifestation of God for his day when he come face to face with that then that manifestation changed his name foreign gave him an identification changed his walk changed his life changed everything about him so now Jacob he's Jacob is here and and and he asks he asked me your name my name's Jacob he said you'll no longer be called Jacob because you're changed you'll be Israel for as a prince with God thou his power with God and with man and so he got a name change but but then he asked the angel he says what's your name he said that's not what was important about this wrestling match if I could just say it in my own words why do you ask my name that's not what you need to know what you need to know is who you are amen and the whole point of coming face to face with God is so that we can know who we are amen we've lived in this life I mean you you may have grown up in the message you may have grown up in a church tradition or wherever you grew up in in a Godly family just like Jacob did and understand the promises and what happened before amen but what you need to do is come face to face with God a living God to the person of God himself who will show you who you are amen not who your parents are who brother Branham was but who you are and change your life so that you walk different from then on this little duck he thought he was a chicken but he got a smell of water one time and he run off and brother I said that's the same thing that the believer is there's something in him that when he meets God face to face he comes to himself the seed is in him and it's quick and my that's right and he flies away from the things of the world they become dead to him my I remember we all had our life in the past and those things of the world but once we got a hold of that real thing something that quickened us a little seed that comes to life then all the things of the world rotted right there we had no more desire of it amen Brotherhood says in the unchangeable God what a man what a way to meet God in a wrestling match but it was God regardless of whether he's in a burning bush or a wrestling match it was God and the main thing was that Jacob he had dreams and visions and so forth but this was one time he could lay his hand on something and say it's God and he was able to hold on to it until the blessing came oh if we could do that if we could find a spot to where we could see God whether it's in his word wherever it is and recognizes God and hold on to hold on to it until the blessing comes wrestle it out with God God promised to do it God said if we'd seek we'd find ask and it shall be given knock and it'll be open every word is true when Jacob got a hold of something that he could look at hold to with his hands and seen that it was God he would not turn loose oh my so what is this message amen what is the open book what is brother Graham said what is the opening of the seals revealing Christ for those seals are Christ amen it's him this word is him the opening of the book is the unveiling of God and when we can get a hold of it we can come face to face with God in the revealing of his word and come in contact with God and recognize as God he said Jacob had seen Visions Jacob had seen dreams Jacob had seen so much amen but when he come in contact with something he could get his hands on he wouldn't turn loose and what God has done for us for the seed in this day he has presented himself and made himself available [Music] he has come by our way just like the angel uh Jacob I mean Jacob didn't know where he was going he didn't know where to find a supernatural being but that being presented himself to Jacob and Jacob got a hold of it how are you going to find God where are you going to go what mountain do we climb what Temple will you go to where will you direct people you see God has made himself available God has come by he's passing by the question is do you see him do you see it's more than a man and more than a group of people and more than a church setting it's more than printed books it's more than audio recordings it's more than paper and ink it's more than sound it's more than that this is God unveiling himself this is God presenting himself to a people to where a people can come face to face with God in this generation that which is perfect has come to take away the cloudiness of the mirror we've been looking at so that we can get a clear identification of Who We Are now who's going to get a hold of it and not turn loose till it changes them it's the question who's going to get a hold of it and not turn loose say well brother Chad I was raising the message on my life it didn't change me get a hold of it and don't let go and go to imploring God Amen going to speak to God Amen the way Moses spoke to God God if you don't go with me don't let me take one more step I don't want to live another day without you in my life go talking to him like Moses talked to him amen you're not going to your mind can't change his mind your speech is it's just it's just words it's just air over vocal cords but there's a seed inside that's crying out for something and if it's genuine it can turn the head of God and God will listen to what you're saying we've got a whole Bible full of stories to prove that's true don't be so passive and say well you know I I've been in the message all my life and I was a kid and I've never seen it work for me amen he's passing by your way why don't you get a hold of him man get both hands on him and say I'm not turning loose of this till it changes me not just I'm going to be in the church and I'm going to be like everybody else and I'll be honest and kind and good and do all of this and if it works out it works out and if it don't work out it don't that's a Jacob mentality and if it works out and everything's fine then I'll keep serving God and I'll bring my tithe no are you part of the promise seed are you one of those that this message came to find if you're confused about it go to get a hold of God and say God I've got to know if this message is for me or not I've got to know I I I've got to be different than I am I've got to be chained I can't take another day the the with the way I am I cannot live like this I think sometimes we're just way too passive especially when we're well you know you get surrounded by people who have fought to overcome I mean when we hear testimonies we sit down and talk to one another there's people who have fought to overcome fought through all kinds of distress and unbelief and terrible circumstances and fought through ridicule and ideas and physical circumstances whatever they may be fought through all of that fought through their own mind and their own doubts and fought through and persevered until something changed in their life amen and they had a transformation and we're surrounded by those people and it creates a wonderful environment amen but that environment is not the same as meeting God face to face yourself Jacob had come into wonderful environments I'm sure the environment in Isaac's home was wonderful I'm sure the environment around Abraham was wonderful I'm sure that these things were wonderful and he knew so much amen but he had to come in contact with God to a living God face to face with the reality of God Amen not the concept but the reality and he would not turn it loose till it changed him tell you this message is Christ and if you get a hold of him it'll change you won't be the same you won't stay the same it'll change you Jesus told his disciples he that endureth to the end shall be saved not those who tried for a while and said it didn't work but those who are convinced that it's true will get a hold of it and stay there till it changes them the the the Jacob mentality's got to go and maybe God will in his Mercy allow us sometimes to get into Straits where we have no options get into troubles and get into circumstances and that's the mercy and grace of God I don't want to see anybody to have to go that way but if you have to go that way Amen to meet God face to face then that's the thing that's needed but I said let's get let's let's recognize who's here in the in the message brother Brian said God came down and he had a wrestling match and stayed with God and held on until the blessing came I like Jacob in this way when he actually seen something that was right when he got his hand on something that was true he held on until he got results oh my not if not if this and then I'll do that and hopefully it'll work out listen that's no way to live don't live that way don't just come to church and recognize that the message was probably right and it's better than anything else I've heard and I'm going to go along with it because it seems to produce a good life and everything don't go on like that friends don't just keep going on but get to a place where you say God I've got to have something in me change amen not that I'm going in the current that I'm caught in the Stream and moving along with everybody else but if there is nobody else I've got to know where I stand I've got to meet you face to face personally amen with a personal meeting amen that's what we all need and listen I don't think God just comes and has a conference with us one time in our life I don't know about you but I've had conferences with God Amen I've had times where I get in situations and I get in circumstances again and again I trip myself up and I get in a place where I have no solution and I get desperate and I cry out to God and so I've had all night prayer meetings before crying out to God Amen but it was what I needed to come in contact with a fresh portion of God with a fresh revelation of who I am and what direction I'm going on and there's many conferences with God but we've got to have that one conference with God where we know we've met a living God and something about us is different we're no longer like we were I want to go to Isaiah chapter 6. if you'll turn there with me Isaiah chapter 6 is very familiar portion of scripture but we know Isaiah was a prophet and he admired Hezekiah I believe it was or Uzziah in uziah was a Godly King and and but he had he had backslided the end of his life and and Isaiah was there he was a prophet of God he serving God but God needed to take Isaiah to another level and when he saw the trouble with Uzziah he was troubled and and it bothered him but God was going to use all of this trouble for a purpose and in Isaiah chapter 6 verse 1 it says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple brother bam said God had to get his eyes off of Uzziah so God took Uzziah off the scene listen don't get your eyes on some great preacher and don't even get your eyes on another great believer God God wants to meet you face to face with nobody else in the group and nobody else in between so don't look at a brother or sister you got confidence in or a spouse or or or anything like that you've got to meet God face to face so the year that Uzziah died said I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face with Twain he covered his feet with Twain he did fly and one cried into another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved that the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes has seen the king the Lord of hosts when when Isaiah comes in contact with the Living God himself he recognizes I'm nothing I'm nothing and I have no more confidence in Uzziah I have no more confidence in the priesthood I have no more confidence amen it didn't mean the priesthood was wrong it didn't mean Isaiah was wrong it did but what it meant was that that all Man All Flesh is a failure amen All Flesh all together is a failure to begin with there's no confidence in anything of that when I saw God he said I recognize that woe is me for I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell amongst the people of unclean lips and they thought they had the word of God and they were speaking the word of God as Oracles of God and they were but they didn't realize how needy they were and he said I woe is me when he met God face to face listen when he met God face to face he didn't walk out of there was his chest stuck up and and and I've met God and now who's the prophet today and who's the mighty one that's not a man who met God face to face when when when uh when Moses met him face to face in the burning bush he says I can't speak I can't go send somebody else when when Jacob met him and became Israel when he got a conversion he walked away limping he walked away in weakness from that point on he wasn't the same man he was he had no strength no more confidence and ability when Isaiah met him Isaiah realized I'm a man of unclean lips and everybody I dwell amongst those unclean lips I said that that pride and arrogant attitude and spirit is not coming from a man who's met God face to face we never saw it in the prophet of God Amen we never saw it in these characters in The Bible amen we never saw it in them we shouldn't see it in ourselves you can't say well I know the message and I'm this and I'm bride and I'm this and that hey if if you ever get a recognition of who you are amen it'll do something to your flesh that will weaken your flesh to the point where you no longer have any confidence in your flesh that's what happened to Jacob and that's what happened to Isaiah so if we ever come face to face with God we're going to lose self-confidence and we're going to gain God confidence you would think that if we take that scripture out of First Corinthians 13 and say now we look into a mirror the word is a mirror now Darkly but then face to face and then you realize I'm the word you would think that that Revelation would Puff a man up when God come to Moses and say you're I'm going down to deliver the children of Israel come I'm sending you Moses didn't say good choice God he came in contact with the Living God it terrified him and he realized I can't do it when God spoke to the nation of Israel face to face they were supposed to come up to him when he spoke to them they were terrified and they ran away and said we can't do it we can't approach to God Moses said I exceedingly tremble and Quake amen it's not as though you come in contact with a living God face to face with God and now you're now you're you're you're you're bold and yourself and you're stuffed you're a stuffed shirt and you're so self-confident no if it does anything it'll help you realize how bad your flesh is and how horrible you are and how desperately you need God in every area of your life and then if you walk away with any confidence at all you have confidence on who he is and who he's called you to be and that he'll do it all hey brother Branham said in the message thirst said Isaiah that great thirst that he had he perhaps was schooled he probably had a good education he had a marvelous conception of what God ought to be you got that he had lots of experience he had been around for a long time he had a marvelous conception of what God ought to be he had heard the priest he had been in the temple he had been raised to be a believer but you see he had never come face to face with it before he had a desire to do right he wanted to be right but he just had the educational side he had the theological side of it but when he got there in the temple that day and he seen those cherubims waving These Wings back and forth and realized that these angels ministered in the face of God and them Angels didn't even know what sin was and stand in the presence of God they had to cover their holy faces to stand in the presence of God then that Prophet Cried Out woe is me for I'm a man of unclean lips all of my Theology and stuff that I've learned all of my marvelous conception that I had of God I am face to face with it now he said I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell with the people that's unclean lips all their teaching of the laws and things that they had done had never reached that place to where he came into the presence of God and seen God with his own eyes and his Trail when he was sitting up on high in the heavens and there he was face to face with reality and he cried I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among a people of unclean lips and then it was that the cherubim took the tongues and the coal of fire from The Altar and touched them unclean lips and turned him from a coward from an educated man a teacher to a prophet that the word of God could speak through sure while he was in the presence of God it was something different that thirst that he had had reached that place then until he was filled with it and let me tell you friend I don't care how much churches you join how many names you put on which away you go and whether you are sprinkled baptized or whatever you are until you meet that person Jesus Christ that's the only thing that will really satisfy emotion won't do it you might jump up and down and shout as long as you want to or you might run up and down the floor and you might speak in tongues as much as you want to and then things are all holy and good I don't say I don't say nothing against that but until you meet that person that satisfying portion that something that takes every fiber in your body not by emotion but by a satisfaction that's what we need we need to meet the reality not the concept the reality we need to meet the person of the word not not the the the just the letter form but the living word amen in our day he's here he's here he's come by amen there's a there is there's a man come by who's speaking figuratively there's a man come by that you can get a hold of amen and if you can get a hold of him amen you can hold on till He blesses you till he changes your name so he changes your identity until he causes you to lose all confidence in the flesh there's a man here it's the Lord Jesus Christ he's here where is he he's here to speak to you face to face how do you know he's not speaking to you now what are you looking for what is your imagination tell you what if he's here through the preaching of the word presenting himself to you yeah what if he's here using a vessel of clay and and vocal cords of a human being but what if he's present now laying out his plan and his word and his identification of you and he's here to meet you face to face what are you going to wait for what are you going to look for what other manifestation do you want before you give in amen God is presenting himself through the opening of the word through the word he's presenting himself he is the word he's the person of the word the veil has been taken off the word and he's it's the unveiling of God and he's here Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's the seventh seal he's here now presenting himself he's available you can get a hold of him and you can wrestle it out with him and you can start talking to him like Moses did and said God if you don't if your presence doesn't go with me don't live me Live Another Day don't let me go up and don't let me keep moving forward don't let me keep acting like a message believer make me a message believe me I don't want to be a church member I don't want to be this I want to be your son I want to be your daughter I want to be your bride I need a name change and I need you to touch something in me that'll cause me to lose confidence in this flesh and change me change the way I walk change the way I talk change the way I think God Jacob could not do it to himself there is no Reformation for Jacob there was only a transformation for Jacob and the transformation come and meeting God face to face his transformation came at penniel when he met God face to face the face how are we going to meet God face to face he's taken the veil off of his word he's uncovered himself amen he's tore the veil of denomination off of the word so you can see him and the day that God was in the form of Jesus Christ the Lamb of God being slain for the sins of the world he was hanging on a cross and God reached down and he tore the veil in the temple from top to bottom because he wanted them to see where he was he wasn't there but The Mercy Seat was there hanging on that cross amen what was it the word made flesh was hanging there on the cross and he tore the veil to show he's not there that's empty now he's moved on and in this day he's torn the veil again he's torn the veil of denominations the veil of man's understanding on the word he has ripped it open to show that he's not there he's not behind that theology that understanding that interpretation where is he he's here in the opening of the word it's him it's Christ what do I do I mean it's not that you go and hug up your message books that you get a hold of this word this promised word for this day and say Lord this is your promise this is what you said this is if this is true it's got to be in me I've got to be identified I don't just have to identify it I have to be identified with it it's not good enough to say that that Prophet was Malachi 4. amen that's a wonderful thing to say and that's a wonderful Revelation to me but but the message came to identify you so that you with the clear mirror of the word can look into the word and behold face looking into face to come contact with the Living God and recognize that God wants to be a living God in you you say he's a living God where is he a living God he's a living God over there and he's a living God in that one and he's a living God in that church he's a living God and those Believers but he wants to be a living God living in you and Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet of God says look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ and the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what's God trying to do Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing what is the revelation of this Christ in you we can study and read and study and read and study and read and still never come to the understanding what this what he's trying to do is get you to see yourself and every story and every time he's trying to get you to see you're like this and you're like this and you're the same kind of person you're the same kind of seed you're in the same kind of lineage you're in these same kind of circumstances I'm the same kind of God nothing's changed I want you to see yourself I want you to see yourself in Esther and I want you to see yourself in Ruth and I want you to see yourself in Mary I want you to I want you to be able to look and see Faith shining back at face and recognize Who You Are what is the new birth then you say well brother man what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now you joined a church you shook a hand you've done something different you said Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody else says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon that's what he wants us to understand when when Jacob the sir planter come in contact with the manifested word when he came in contact with that something in him knew that this was the thing that could deliver me is there anything in you that knows that this revealed word this message is the thing that can deliver you it is what else is there what church what form of theology what understanding where else are you going to find to get delivered from this condition we're in this word that's been revealed in this day at the opening of the seals the word the mystery of God that has been unveiled and the unveiling of God that's presented itself here is the very thing that can deliver us and when he came in contact with that in his day he got a hold of it and refused to let go until he was changed and I would encourage you if you're something in you that's stirring and says this message is the only thing that can deliver then get a hold of it don't let it be somebody else's you get a hold of it don't let somebody else grab a grip on it you get a hold of it and hold on to it until it changes you and say God it's got to change me you've got to change me I've got to be different I've got to be changed and then when that word is open and it goes back and reveals all the fallacy of denominationalism the 2 000 years of man's Concepts and ideas bring ruined Nation to the church when it goes back and shows false Doctrine and false content and sincere men who love God who were doing their very best you understand these weren't people who hated God Amen that were getting off and who were believing wrong things these were people who loved God were sincere and desired to know God we're doing the best they could to study God's word and teach the understanding they had of God's word and they were doing it wrong because the the the veil wasn't taken off that portion of the word yet and when God in the in the opening of the word takes us back down through history and shows us failure after failure after failure after failure it's the same as God touching Jacob and the sinew of his thigh you realize I can't do it amen I can't figure God out I can't come up with it on my own I can't do right in my flesh I can do nothing amen and there's a realization that comes with this Revelation and how foolish man is and how much God's children have messed up God's plan to where for the rest of your life you never trust yourself again for the rest of your life you never trust your thinking that's why you read the Bible and you'd be like oh I bet that means that and the first thing you do is say what did God teach through the prophets because now you're limping you're not so sure of your steady walk you're not so sure that you can figure this Bible out and you read it and you hear somebody say oh that sounds good I think that's what that means and then you go back to the message you find it's taught completely different in the message and you realize thank you God I don't have any more confidence in the flesh none of my old abilities are going to save me anymore that's what happened to Jacob when he met God face to face that's what happens to us when we meet God face to face we don't lean on our own understanding anymore we don't lean on our own abilities and our own Concepts and our own strength you realize I don't have the strength to live this message we're talking just the flesh side when you get to the flashlight I do not have the strength to live this message what is the call in this message the call is to live the very life of Jesus Christ in your flesh what he would say you would say what he would do you would do you realize how impossible that is if it's not for him he's got to come and live it through us I've got these got to change me if he this message handicap My Flesh this message wrecked my life if I could take you back 20 something years 23 years take you back when I was first married and been raised in Pentecostal churches and knew I knew the Bible I was raised all my life my pastor was my great uncle my grandpa was one of the ministers in the church I mean we were we were raised and we were clean living and we had moral standard we believe the King James version of the Bible and preached out of it and and all of these other things we had it all just right and everything was fine in my life and I was first married and had a baby do on the way and bought a new home and everything was perfect and I was going in My Own Strength and God brought the message along and wrecked my whole life knocked every prop out from under me I lost confidence in everything I'd ever been taught I lost confidence in my ability to even think morally I lost confidence in my ability to live a clean life I lost confidence in everything that I had of self and everything that I'd used before to be a good church member and a nice boy and a good Pentecostal church God knocked it right out from under me and from that point on I have limped in the flesh because I know I cannot do this I know what I was before and I know how I failed before and I know what he's done for me and I don't want to be strong in my flesh when Paul came to the Lord amen and he met him on the road to Damascus Paul was strong Paul was able Paul had intelligence Paul had a good standing in the church but what did God do God struck him amen and he he weakened him and he gave him a thorn in the flesh and he weakened Paul amen and Paul wanted it to go away but he said my strength is made perfect in your weakness and now Paul had no more confidence in his education no more confidence and ability no more confidence in his lineages or his attachments to the high priest he gave it all up and he will walk the week through this world but Mighty in God brother Branham never had anything going for him he never had he never had physical strength he was racked with sickness from the beginning of his ministry he never had attachment or finances or education but that's exactly what God wanted to display himself he didn't have that prophet of God had no confidence in his flesh he had confidence in the word of God Paul had no confidence in his flesh he had confidence in the word of God and we need to have no confidence in our flesh but confidence in the word of God say God strike us Smite us Lord so we no longer think we can walk right without you but no longer we think we can do something we can't do anything without him the greatest gift that he gave to Jacob was a halting walk when Jacob no longer had any strength that's when Jacob became strong I want to look I want to look at Genesis 33 as we finish we'll just finish with this Genesis 33 verse 1. and Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold Esau came and with him 400 men and he divided the children unto Lee and unto Rachel and unto the two handmaids and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and Lee and her children after Rachel and after and Rachel and Joseph hinder most and look at this and he passed over before them instead of coming last now he goes first what happened to Jacob the coward was now limping up in front he was scared he wanted to go behind us and everything first and he wanted him to see the women and children and everything before they come to him but now he's been smitten he's been Afflicted he's come in contact with God but he's not afraid of Esau anymore because now he's not looking at his own strength or his ability he has no ability to deceive he's got nothing going but now he goes out in front he takes his position and he bowed himself to the ground and bound himself to the ground and seven times until he came near to his brother and brother bear says in the evening messenger he says Jacob on his road home inspired to go back home his brother was meeting him old but one night he wrestled with God he was scared to meet his brother but the next morning he was Fearless limping Prince he was a Fearless limping Prince I don't need Esau nor his army neither one God stepped on the scene see he does it in a peculiar way let's look at verse 8 now this is Esau speaking he says and he said what meanest thou all this drove which I met and he said these are to find Grace in the sight of my Lord and Esau said I have enough my brother keep thou keep that thou Hast unto thyself and Jacob said nay I pray thee if now I found Grace in thy sight then received my present at my hand for therefore I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God and that was pleased with me take I pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because God hath dealt graciously with me and because I have enough and he urged him and he took him I want to I want to look at this Jacob had never before said he had enough never had Jacob had enough he always wanted more he was always working to get more but now he had met God and the things that mattered to him before don't matter to him anymore and now that Esau is being kind to his brother Esau before I believe would have took him back but this Esau said nope you take him I have enough why he had God and he urged him and he took it and he said let us take our journey and let us go and I will go before thee now Esau's offering to lead the way now listen Jacob's afraid he was he's always afraid he was afraid to meet Laban he was afraid to meet Esau he's always been afraid now Esau's offering a guarded escort he said in verse 13 He said unto him my Lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and the herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die let my Lord I pray thee pass over before his servant and I will lead on softly according as the cattle as the cattle uh sorry as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until I come unto my Lord and to see her and Esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folks that are with me and he said what needed what needeth it let me find Grace in the sight of my Lord so Esau returned that day on his way in to see her this man who was afraid because he looked at himself he's come in contact with God and now he's no longer afraid to be by himself he's not afraid to go on with himself he's not afraid they're going without Esau's leading he's not afraid to go without the the armed men that he left with him because now he's come in contact with the Living God he's no longer afraid to be by himself this is what brother bam said Jacob stayed all night one night wrestling that wrestling Prince he wrestled all night he had been dodging Esau here and there he was scared to death of him and he heard Esau was coming he put his wife across the brook went over on the other side and knelt down you know God come down and got a hold of Jacob and they wrestled all night he wasn't completely convinced to start with but time God got through with him he was convinced yes he stayed and held on until he was convinced that it was gone brother he wasn't scared of Esau then crossed the river and he was weak and limping the worst time that he could be in looked like he was the weakest he ever was he had been crippled and everything but Esau said to him will you let me send an army along with you to help you said I don't even need the help why he was convinced that God that had a hold of that the God he had a hold of could take care of him I say thank you Lord Jesus I want that kind of experience to where I can get a hold of a living God where I don't need a group around me to feel secure where I don't need protection where we don't need armies where we don't need defenses either ourselves or anybody else's but we can get to a place where though I'm weak and though I recognize I have no ability I know everything's fine because I met a living God and I know his promise is no longer if but it is when that's what that's what Jacob recognized brother Branham said in the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness oh what a preacher this great man he sought God he said God I am weak he's talking about the Apostle Paul I don't know what to do I just pray God give me strength take my infirmities away from me and these things so I can be stronger God spoke back to him and said Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness then Paul said when I'm weak then then I am strong yes he said I will glorify in my infirmities and my weaknesses and so forth I'm thanking God that I got all of it out of me and when I get everything out of me then God can come in but as long as I got some of myself there then God can't get in there that's it we smother him out we drive him away from the poor of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves I said God let me get my own self out of the way again in the same message he says brother ma'am is now talking about the time he went to see oral Robert's office and he stepped out of that great campus and he saw the great buildings and he had that thought maybe God couldn't trust me with this much money maybe God just couldn't trust me with this and this is where he's talking about he says remember standing by A Great temple one time said Lord I hate for them to come to my office he said I am your portion who needs an office then who needs an office who needs a facility who needs a salary who needs anything when God himself said I am your portion I am your portion see I am your portion and weakness then my strength is strong my perfect will can be done Paul or Elijah whoever you are when you get out of the way in your weakness then I'm made strong I'm the one I'm the strong one that comes in and fills up I want to meet a living God I want to come face to face with the god in this day that's presented himself and made himself available to the believer in this day and I want in that meeting with him I want him to change me I want to be weakened I mean that sounds terrible but I want no more confidence in the flesh that's what meeting God has done no more confidence in the flesh he's so great and the fallacy of humanity is so exposed and the Fallen nature of man from The Garden of Eden's been so exposed that I want no more confidence I want in my flesh to be weakened because if I can be weakened In the Flesh he can be made strong because his strength is made perfect in my weakness I want to come in contact with the Living God that doesn't make me feel like I you know that I'm the man I can do this and I'll go out there and I'll take charge and I'll do that and I'll do this I want to have the contact with God that says I tried everything and failed and everything if anything's going to happen it's not me it's going to be him and me I want to walk with that kind of humility like Paul had and brother banham had and Isaiah came to and that Jacob came to and I want the kind of meeting face to face with God that gives me a true identity of who I really am Jacob was called Sir planter but he was Israel and I've been called whatever I've been called not even bad names good names good boy and Chad and whatever but there's one name I want more than any other there's one identification that changes everything in my life and that's when he called me bride when he called me Mrs Jesus Christ it changed everything now I know who I am I know why I'm here I'm not here for all those selfish reasons I had before I'm not here for that that's not the life that he wants from me amen the meeting with God has weakened My Flesh praise God I have no confidence and it's given me an identification of who I really am and has brought me in contact with the living Jesus Christ today so that's the encounter that we all need I mean is that the encounter you want to have is here it's available you don't have to run to the mountain you don't have to go to the desert you don't have to go to a certain church or a certain building or a certain Ministry you've got to come to Christ the word that's been made manifest in this day come to The Living Word come face to face with the Living God and let him change you man let's all stand musicians if you'll come I just want to stop right there and we'll get to the rest of it some other time but oh how we need him you would think these meetings with God these encounters with God that all these people have had that it would have made them 10 foot tall and Bulletproof but it made Moses afraid to go it made brother Branham realize how little he was it made the Apostle Paul realize that everything he ever knew he had to count his dung and that all of that he had going for him was not that it made Jacob realize that he was a failure to begin with these meetings with God they have a way of changing us for the better but not for self-betterment in a humanistic way this isn't self-help and you be a better person this is you come into contact with the Living God and recognize that I am nothing without this that I can't save myself I can't help myself that this is the only reality that there is and I'll not let this go until it changes me amen that's my desire for everyone every every person every child of God I want us all have the same experience however it comes and whatever and whatever way that God meets you and however he speaks to your heart and however you get a hold of him it doesn't matter how that's not what I'm concerned with I don't care if it's in church or out of church I don't care if it comes with sensation or no sensation but when you come in contact with God and you know that you're in contact with a living God and that changes you and changes the way you walk and changes the way you think that's what we need I said God let that be a reality in this place today let it be a reality in our lives that's what we want amen let's bow our heads and pray together oh heavenly father I thank you Lord for the word that you have given to us God I'm so thankful that in this generation you're speaking face to face to your children Lord there's no more obscurity there's no more cloudiness you rip the veil of denominational understanding you tore it open to show us that you're here you're here in the revealing of your word you're present in your word [Music] go on that word is to be made manifest in a people your desire for this day is to get preeminence in your bride that's the word made flesh in this day God help us to embrace that God forgive us for our foolishness Lord forgive us Lord for our Jacob mentality of hoping and if and but God bring us into that personal contact God Moses wasn't able to find you you found him Paul wasn't able to find you you found him God all down through you knew how to find your people when it came time to send out your Prophet you came to him God I prayed that you would present yourself to your children now that there's any here Lord who's not coming to personal contact with you and been born again by your spirit I pray you would come to them now may they recognize that you're here Lord that you're present may you present yourself to them and give them an opportunity to grab a hold Lord I pray Lord that you would fulfill your promise in every life in my life my
