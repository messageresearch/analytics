TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so many times in our thinking when we see that that that dream showed brother branham on the white horse going as far to the west as he could go and then turning amen and he says we've gone far west if we go any farther we'll we'll be back east that's that is going through the pacific ocean back east but that's not how we go back east brother branham said you turn at the west coast and go right back to jerusalem again so there's not going back east it's not going across the pacific ocean going back east is turning at the west at the opening of the seals turning at the west and riding back and that's why brother bram said she'll ride back one of these things she'll ride right back she sure will why she's turning at the west and going back going back where back to where it all started in jerusalem and this spirit of elijah which is the spirit of christ will be upon this church until that elijah rises with moses and elijah and if you think about the man the message the way the message is traveled and spread the message at the opening of the word when brother branham was out west and received the commission amen to go back and open the seals it went from west he said we went as far west brother branham preached in los angeles i mean he got all the way out there and he preached birth pains all the way out in los angeles and it turned at the west and that message has been traveling in all nations and covering the globe where did it turn where did it turn from church ages to bride where did it turn from denominations to the word where did it come back to christ in his church again it turned at the west amen it traveled as far as it could west it turned at the west and now it for for almost 60 years it's been going back and it'll keep going back until it gets back to jerusalem but how has it been traveling amen and what vessels has the message been traveling it's not in the vessel amen of malachi 4 brother branham it's in the vessel of the bride the bride's been carrying the message the bride's been spreading the gospel the bride has evangelized south america europe amen amen all through russia into asia amen and it's coming back friends it's coming right back to jerusalem somebody asked me before what will that look like how will the bride brother bam said the gentiles will take the gospel right back to the jews i don't know what the handoff will look like i don't know if it's physical i don't know if we just carry it until he takes us and they pick it up i have no idea all i know is that spirit is riding in this bride it's been riding it turned at the west and it's riding back to the east it's going back to where it started to pick up the 144 000 to bring in the millennium amen and when in that that spirit has not stopped writing when the prophet left it's been riding in and through his bride that's why he says he'll ride his church right to glory in the resurrection because this is the resurrection
