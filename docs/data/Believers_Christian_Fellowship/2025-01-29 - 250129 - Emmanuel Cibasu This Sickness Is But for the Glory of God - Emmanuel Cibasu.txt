may not where he is he is not happy snow buries me I like 85 86° so God bless you and uh I know brother Chad has uh just announced it uh this is something I was actually I was foreseeing it uh by May June of this year so uh just to put it U um on simple terms I know a couple of years been a couple two years now that I've been uh um laid off and I didn't feel any pressure to go back to work for a couple of years and the Lord has provided for for me and the family and uh so I had some offers even within the LI area within the Columbus area I didn't feel led to take anything because uh I just wanted to be available for mostly Mission field and I'm still available and so I I just put it in God's hand and said I just don't want to take something because I want to take it I know it can provide for my family or whatever but it seems like the level of uh um the way we we see things and the desire as I usually tell some brothers I said something has happened in in my life I don't have any need only need I have is of him any natural need I can boil the eggs and and be fine I'd be fine so the only need I has have is God I just want you more of you within me amen so it's it's something it's something that is craving me it makes you odd sometimes even to your own family it makes you odd but that's the reality that uh we come and say God wherever you want to place me I would be fine I would be fine and you will find that we're going to be reading a couple words here brother R says that love is the ultimate God's love to to us so um um my brother Works in in the government within the president of the Dr cono um in Africa so he's he's talked to me about probably about a year seeing any consideration in probably uh doing some diplomatic project uh with them um within the DC area uh we've talked more than a year ago but we thought probably by May June things could be start finalizing but he surprised me um probably a couple of weeks ago that he want things to to be done so there's certain things to be done there just a little projects as brother Chad said an assignment that uh will require me to be away uh to be close to the DC area with the family uh the time frame is probably 6 to a year to see uh what would uh would happen then but uh just uh request your prayers it's not easy it's never been easy even to leave just to know that Wednesday and Sundays I won't be here on that uh corter there it's uh it's it's it's very difficult for the love that uh you have for usen and we have for youen and uh this is home home to to us home to me and it's it's it's not been easy even right now it's it's still kind of uh something that's it's it's not easy just pray for me even going so I don't see anything that uh it's just that things have turned out the way they are to be now so planning to move out to drive the first U-Haul truck by Friday and I only my my left arm is is no longer working good so I thought Brothers could live nearby Columbus can help me maybe load a couple of items in the truck but I know it's far away from you guys about an hour and 30 minutes CU I want probably Micah and my wife there and my daughters to to help me carry some beds in to the truck so I can take off Friday morning because I had to open the office by Monday uh it's a new office and just to be able to sit on things there to start working on many many many assets there and just keep us in your prayers and then once I move out I take the first truck uh this Friday morning uh and then we'll come back again my family will be here for the weekend service I'll be in the DC because I need to open the office on Monday so they'll be able to attend the service on Sunday here and then the following week at um weekend also so we'll be Tak taking out the the second truck so but we'll be here so we'll be tuning in uh every we're streaming in every time and if I have a couple of three days or two days I'll be this way yeah it is it's our house thank you God bless you and you may stand up with milk can read the scriptures I know Sister Mary and sister W on the road as our pastor has prayed we're praying for them and also remember remember the brothers and sisters in the GMA area this is in the Congo the east of the Congo uh there there's a kind of war going on in the area the area we know very well we've been there with brother um brother um SAS um and um with uh brother Burley also and myself so just pray for the Believers so they are stuck there they don't have electricities for a couple of days in town and just remember them all right okay we're going to be turning uh searching and read the word of God and I know that uh our pastor could not uh announce it before days so you could be praying for me I know everybody prayed for him so now could you please change your prayers while we're reading the scriptures turn them towards me that God will help me help me stand and speak I I had some scriptures the the the good thing the confidence is my pastor was even encouraging me is what you love is what I love we all love the word of God as I'm going to be even reading some scriptures or the quotations probably pay less attention to me pay more attention to the holy spirit inside of you who's going to be telling more than I can tell so he's he's going to be revealing it to you as I'm we read it he's going to be probably five times giving you what I can even add in one word so just p and amen God bless you let's read go to the scripture in the Book of John uh St John chapter 11 and this is a familiar scripture about uh Lazarus and uh his two sisters uh John chapter 11 we're going to be start reading the the first five verses then we'll be sitting down now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this this sickness is not unto death but the glory but for the glory of God that the son of God God might be glorified thereby now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus let's have a word of prayer you precious Lord we are again so blessed to be finding ourselves in this very moment at this very hour in front of your precious word we could have been uh at different places at this time we could have been probably laying in the hospitals maybe having to be checked every every five minutes for oxygen level or we could be in an emergency room or we could be stuck or father but your grace and your love has proceeded us and they provided a way that we can be finding ourselves in the best place ever where two or three can gather and father we de so blessed and fortunate to to be so to be that kind of people that you allowed out to and father now as we have read these uh few blessed words of yours Lord you you know there's nothing in man that could even come closer to interpret you are your only interpreter would you come and bless us in the reading of a few scriptures we have we have already prepared here and the quotation and father you're the one who would interpret to each and every one of us we just commit and submit Lord this service unto you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated so I took the um title of our little uh Bible study tonight is uh when Jesus said this sickness is not un to death but for the glory of God so the title is this sickness is but for the glory of God and this as I'm reading this uh scripture here reading it it seems like that uh not seems but Lazarus was sick and now he had two sisters as we know Mary and Martha they must have seen not noticed that uh the health of their brother was just deteriorating deteriorating and then they uh they decided to do something they said we we we have a solution here we used to have uh his friend here Jesus used to stay with us who treated him and we know that that man is a prophet we've seen things he said and how he had acted so they had well good intention and of who Jesus was they knew that he was a prophet and they treated him very well and they thought in this scenario Jesus is the one who could could uh bring help who can help their brother he can say a word he can say something and Lazarus would be would be would be healed and we as the Bible mention it we don't have any record of their parents so they must have been living about themselves parents might have been dead and there's no record that Mary and Martha was married Mary and Martha were married so they might have been maybe did not uh um get married and they only have their brother there who was representing a man in their house representing too much for them to lose him and then to stay just two single sisters so it was something going on there and as I'm reading going back to the chapter 10 you find that the things started in the winter it could have been winter there that's what I don't like winter but you those who like it I'm fine with you so you remember that in the chapter 10 before the chapter 11 Jesus was in Jerusalem and he went to the the temple for the dedication it was in the winter as he was disputing with the with the the the priest and the Sadducees Pharisees he they kicked him out now he had had to run away and to hide himself in bethabara which is where John the Baptist used to baptize it's east of Jordan so he went there to hide for a little while but as he went there he cannot hide people were still following him I'm pretty sure it was still in the winter time that this sickness struck Lazarus and as these things are happening it's happening in the winter and these two ladies had no one else to go to Lazarus were like their parent like a father to them like a brother more than a brother to them and at this moment they they are sending you notice that in the chap in the first in the third verse of the chapter 11 they didn't go out they are sending somebody Maybe Mary and Martha tried to find a cousin of theirs maybe a neighbor somebody who could relate to Jesus what was going on in their their little home now they are sending somebody and from their place from Bethany to bethar that's a day walk in the winter don't know how many hours it took for the career to walk there living from the west side and headed up there to bethar to find Jesus and after the person the one who was sent got there he's now telling Jesus what Mary and Martha had uh asked and requested him to say the person is telling Jesus about the sickness and Jesus is just giving the word in verse four when Jesus heard it because it was added to him he heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now between the verse four and the verse five could you just imagine what happened there how that man who might have heard a good testimony about Jesus being a gentle man being a good Prophet being the the god the man that was so full of compassion if he hears he would come right away to to come and heal the sick and he's been in many places has been invited he always goes what was going in his mind have no idea even by the time he's leaving where Jesus was another day walk back to Bethany what was going on people that he was encountering asking about Lazarus what what are you doing on this side I came I was sent Lazarus very sick and then I went to find his friend Jesus the the Nazareth good Mighty Prophet look what he told me he didn't even he didn't even come he just said that word he looked maybe he was talking to other people what was going on in Martha's mind what was going on in Mary's mind so between the the verse four and verse five there are too many things going on there too many murmurings too many things being spoken because we're humans we can reason out things why didn't he come you just come here here to see our pastor and said brother Chad would you would you pray for my daughter something is going on she's just maybe in the accident in the hospital oh she she'll be fine he doesn't even come with you he didn't come to pray so many things happening there but you know the greatest thing John the writer knew that any of those things could not be in the uh being a part of uh the chapter the the the verse five right he's putting it there yeah now Jesus loves Martha and her sister and Lazarus period praise amen meaning that it is the love it that is the greatest don't even talk about you don't even know what this what's happening and the prophet of God said this in uh the remembering the Lord preaching 1962 he said love is the ultimate of Grace so while they were murmuring Marth and Mary they were human being like us the Korea murmuring speaking why didn't questioning themselves something greater than what they were murmuring went forth before them the love of God preceded them love is is the ultimate Grace love is God's ultimate for us after all other gifts and things has vanished our prophecy our tongues our interpretations all that we've ever done or what more When Love Comes it's the ultimate it's above all cause all other will fail it's the Supreme Court decision praise God when they were murmuring questioning themselves had no idea a supreme decision has been made for us and I like the way the the writer writing it he said he doesn't he didn't say that Jesus loved them love is not a bulk love it's a person personal individual Jesus loved Martha her sister Mary and Lazarus right now in this area God doesn't love BCF God loves you loves her loves him loves the me and because we are part of BCF then BCF is loved but it's you individually and it's and then the prophet of God says again something I just want to to bring you up in the the message beyond the curtain of time I we don't have time to go that it's Wednesday the prophet is giving how when he went beond the curon of time and the ladies and the people he saw there he's coming up with summarizing something I'm just it's just two sentence of summary he said see we must approach God through that channel of love and faith faith take takes us to the the channel Faith takes us to the channel that's right but love is the one that takes us in amen because faith will end one day but love will take us in and as I was looking at this said this is strange that is Jesus spoke he didn't even go but the writer is com coming up with something that is just so tremendous in Simplicity we don't even see it that's right Jesus loved Martha that's right her sister Mary amen and their brother Lazarus amen individual love the prophet of God says in the do you believe in preaching 1955 he said now there are two different kinds of love he he wants to tell us about the filo love and the agapo love there's human love which is a Greek word is filio love and the agapo love is the high love of divine love now you take the little you take like the filio love when we have that love a mother for her baby will drive her right straight to a flaming fire to save that baby's life it will make a man for his sweetheart lay down his life anytime that's ail Your Love see see what I mean that's just human love and I believe somewhere in the Bible it said could a mother forget her little suckling babe said you may but I can never forget you for you are engraved on the palm of my hand don't leave it on the on the screen here that's you and to me you and I we are engraved on the the palm of his hand cuz you will realize that Lazarus was there sick and Jesus said this sickness is but for the glory of God you might be having something right now that you are going through yes a situation that has been probably for you unsolved for years right maybe 20 years maybe 15 years but listen Jesus is telling you that why whatever you going through it's for the glory of God and we'll we'll see it later on it's for the glory of God whatever you are going through right now that that is taking your sleep away at night or you questioning how is he going to turn around or how with the solution where would it be coming from right just you know it yourself I know myself just know that that that very thing there Jesus says it's for the glory of God amen amen and following that he loves you he has given his Supreme decision on your behalf am he said how could God ever forsake us or anything as long as he loves us like that prise God see filo means Fellowship it's the love that you have for your wife and for your husband that would make you kill a man for your wife you'd love uh you'd love her so if he insulted your wife you would take a gun and kill him that's F your love but a agapo love is so much different it would make you pray for his sinful Soul that's the difference see the goap of Love indicates that Jesus loved them more than they ever knew yeah Jesus loved Martha more than Martha ever knew that's right amen Jesus loved Mary more than Mary ever knew Jesus loved la more than Lazarus ever knew don't stop it there amen that's the same thing with you he loves you more than you ever knew about he's the same God he cannot do it to Lazarus and then then not doing it for you and remember mtha might have treated him very well when the Jesus was staying with them them cooking for him washing his clothes providing doing the bed so he can be comfortable at their home little did she know that that man was more than a prophet yeah she only knew that he was a prophet they were ex Pharisees the prophet of God said they were ex- feres even believing in the resurrection you will see that you had no issue believing in that she used to be a Pharisee they used to be Pharisees but she had no idea who was living with them they had no idea and they could not know what kind of love that standing on two feet there loved them with more than they ever knew about and even if they knew that he was God let's put that they might have known that he was God what good would it have done to them if they did not have any need that's right we can know that he's God yeah but if you don't have any need how are we how are you going to bring him on the scene that's right amen the prophet of God gives a little story of uh and you know that and I might might be chopping it off up the little girl in uh in Canada and uh the King George was to visit Canada with the queen and then the school arranged to let out the the the kids out they can go see the king and the queen before they they went there the teachers the gave them Flags little flags that when you go out just to show your uh loyalty to our King you can go see the king and and when you see the king wave your flag and then you come you you we'll come uh gather you and we can come back to school as they weren't there you you know it very well there was a little girl there the king passed and she waved her flag everybody waves their flags and they were happy and with joy but she stayed there she couldn't go in the classroom different from other girls other kids everybody went there everybody saw the king she did see the king too everybody waves waved their flag she did wave her flag too but she had something that no one else had she had a need there was something there she wanted to be related to the king she want the king to pay attention to her there was a craving within her that yes I did wave my I did see the king I did Wave My Flag but the king didn't see me I'm too little and you know how the prophet of God says we have our King you cannot be too little for him to pass you don't think you are too little don't think your Fai your little your faith my little faith is too little there's a king that sees that and then the teacher when they went to school they couldn't find her started looking for her outside and they came found her on the telegraph poll how many less than 20 years knows what telegraph mean means here Telegraph so so she the teacher came and found her around the telegraph pole weeping she approached to her start asking her she was still holding her flat did you see the king yes I did like everybody else did you wave your flag yes I did but what's the matter I was too little the king didn't see me and listen what the prophet says in this he said in hearing him in 1962 now many times God meets in the Realms of great congregations he meets with small congregations one time he met with 500 again he met with 70 he met with 12 he met even with one no matter how small the congregation is God always will meet when you have a [Music] need know sometimes just to myself when I come I said God don't let me to be in a in a in in a state of I don't need you that's the worst thing to be in everything is paid off this is paid off this is paid off I'm fine have no need I'm my my bill of health is perfect brother that's a slow dying that's right the prophet of God God always will meet when you have a need and believe that he will be there because most time he calls us through a need need that's right and the prophet of God says that he usually calls the people when he's got something great to tell them a need is an open door because God has something great to tell you he's got something real and I like how the prophet of God starts a prayer a servy in 1962 before he could start the service he's telling the congregation to to Bow their heads and listen to this prayer before he can start the service 1962 we would see Jesus he said now with our heads bowed and our hearts likewise I wonder if in the building tonight before we start if there would be those here that would like to just raise up their hand to God and say God now during this meeting I have a need amen I have a need would you supply my need Lord I'm going to raise up my hand in just by this God bless you every were and that service if you listen to it there was he he set it up that way the people were so needy that that service was one of the greatest in just the the uh healing and and and and Discerning the thoughts because everybody came anticipating had a need every time I walked there I said Lord I am needy I'm walking those doors because I am in need and I know that you can do more than what what I can even ask for amen so God usually calls us by creating a need remember one time the prophet God of of God said that so God is in the counil of man in 1957 hearing him no matter where it is or how many if you have a need he will come prise if you have a need it's a blessing praise God more blessing that we will even even realize it God is dealing with the needy people you will see that if time allowed us allows us you will see that if you go in the Book of Revelation chapter chapter 3 verse 15-1 17 we can I can read it you don't have to turn on the thing that is mostly hurting this is Jesus himself saying it he said I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor H I would thou were cold or heart so then because thou are look warm and neither cold nor hot I will spew you I spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayth I am rich and increase with good and I have need of nothing this is this is the darkest generation we're going in we've been taken out but the most thing that is God is summarizing Jesus summarizing that the worst of the worst of any age which is leod deia it's because they have need of nothing yes that's true amen need of nothing doors are closed yeah they don't need him Cain didn't need God to move on his with his life he had no need of God said you stay behind I can go I can marry myself I can work he he he he knew everything he could do right but we see that God the prophet of God is mentioning again about the the maniac of GAD he said he crossed the sea overnight to go to the maniac of GAD because that Maniac was in need right the the priests in his town had no need of him because they kicked him out they loved their Hogs more than their they pigs more than they they lack the the presence of the of the of God the almighty God and the prophet of God says again in the healing of J gyus he said now we see him crossing the waters had just left another side where a great Revival could have taken place over in gther but instead of the Revival taking place the people didn't want no Revival see if you don't want Christ he won't push himself on you he certainly won't you have to want him first blessed are they that hunger and do thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled that's it when you hunger even a blessing to hunger and a thirst for righteousness in the same message he said you have to want him you have to have a need so we see that a need is an opportunity when Mary and Martha coming back to the reading of the scripture they had a need of their Lazarus of their brother Lazarus to be healed but that need was not he it did not come to its climax what did they do they send somebody a go between sometimes we send a go between Christ and our eles we want the pastor to pray for us we want the husband to pray we want the wife to pray parents to pray God doesn't like go between cuz Christ is always the go between God and us so we don't want any go between between Christ and us we go directly to him and Jesus knew that as they send that person Jesus knew that the need has not has not come to the crescendo yet had to wait because they still had some hopes maybe he can get he can be healed everything will be all right we'll see but let's let's try but when every Hope Was Gone amen right Lazarus was dead now the scene changed you will come and if we open up to go to uh John we can go start at uh 17 John 11 verse 17 a long way to to come to this then when Jesus came he found that he had had Lain in the grave for 4 days already now Jesus stayed if we remember in verse 7 he 6 or S he stayed in in that place for 2 days after he announced him that Lazarus is sick said hey that sickness is for the glory of God he remained in on that in that place in bethar two days and he knew that Lazarus was going to be dying now after 2 days he knew that Lazarus was dead now Jesus is coming he is coming from bethabara your East Jordan is here I know brother Chad is he draws very good he has beautiful handwriting we don't even have compliment him for that so Jordan was here bethar is this place J Jerusalem is up there and Bethany is down here it was closer for Jesus to come from Beth to Bethany to where Lazarus was Jesus didn't do that he's coming this way he's coming up to Jerusalem Beth Beth Bethany is uh 154 Longs which is about a mile 1.8 miles Jesus coming to Jerusalem cuz he wanted to give them an opportunity to go meet him themselves amen he came because he knew that it was in winter this lady poor lady because he knew that something is now stirring in MAA in Mary he knew that so he's coming to Jerusalem and when MTH is hearing 18 now Bethany was n unto Jerusalem about 15 furong off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming she didn't send anybody amen the need was so great am that she had to go by herself and remember the prophet of God says that she was a dilatory dilatory meaning that she was was always late just late Mary Mary believed quicker she was always in the back working not considering things right away just kind of putting off putting off but this time the Lord is working on this one he knew he loved her he knew that within her there was a seed for eternal life amen but you know what the love of God Is the Love unto salvation Martha had to be saved amen right she had to be saved and you cannot be saved by doing good work amen right she was cooking for Jesus she was doing washing her his clothes she could not be saved by doing that salvation is by faith something had to be brooding somewhere that Martha could come and express her faith her belief into that amen Jesus is giving her her an opportunity then Martha 20 then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died I I I have too many notes probably 10 more pages if I go there kids will be late in school let's go to the Bible then said unto Jesus 21 Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died she's saying it because she knew somewhere that this man was a Prophet this man was different from other men right literally she did not know that this man was God yeah she had no no idea but I 22 but I know that even now whatsoever you will ask God God will give it thee but she was talking to God himself 23 Jesus said unto her now Jesus is not even showing himself that hey I'm I'm God Jesus is going in a way of only God could do that Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again now Mara as I told you they were Pharisees she had no no doubt believing that there was a resurrection they believed in angels Mara said Sith unto him I know but he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day looking at the resurrection is a further event not knowing that the resurrection was a person and not only that 25 Jesus said unto her he's not even saying I'm life he's saying I am the resurrection even the life after the resurrection I'm not only the Resurrection The Life After the resurrection I am so what you see as an event a further event I am it even the life after the resurrection I am that it's and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live live I have a a quotation here for the time sake I don't know where it is but the prophet of God says that when sometimes even us we still have some Pentecostal background in Baptist when we see the Son of God we see a lower son there's a father somewhere with a long beard when we say this Jesus is the son of God there are tendency there's always a tendency to think that there's a father somewhere with the white long beard and Jesus is a son out down here the prophet of God says that a Son of God Jesus being the Son of God means the word wrapped with flesh there's no a father sitting somewhere with a beard it's the fullness of the word of God came down and for men to see it it wrapped itself with the flesh amen right 26 and whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die believeth thou this that was the spoken word and Martha had an opportunity to be born again praise Martha had an opportunity for that seed that was inside of her that Jesus Jesus loved her so much that she couldn't even knowing that within me there's a seed of deity in that seed there in this very moment quickened amen whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this she said unto him yay Lord I believe that thou are the Christ she never knew that this is by revelation amen and if you see it's the very the same statement amen that Peter right by the Holy Ghost declared amen it's Christ said I believe that thou are the Christ the son of God which should come into the world and when she had said she had so said know what she did she never she she for the the the her work was done she just declared that and walked away everything was perfect from that time on Bible said she said unto yay and 28 and when she had she had so said she went her her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and corth for thee no question Jesus are you coming to uh rise my raise my brother up right because she was in a such a level that the Revelation was so struck her in such a way that all was well didn't say come with me mm come and resurrect Lazarus nope something has happened in my life turned away and just went Mary he call for you this message is a secret calling Martha is coming when you see our pastor here every day Wednesday Sunday it's just Martha telling Mary he cth for you amen amen as soon as she heard that she arose quickly this is Mary and came unto him now Jesus was not yet come into the town Jesus was still in that town in Jerusalem still there everything is happening outside of Bethany these ladies are walking Bethy 1.8 miles how long it would take a lady to walk there in the cold of winter and then she went and she came back maybe 45 minutes and things happened there and she's backing again going back again and telling Mary and Mary's walking out the same same could you imagine how critical people were CR criticizing them of things that were happening you have Lazarus dead here what what are what's going on with you guys you just one goes and comes back and the other going and they didn't know that something Celestial Something Heavenly was being unfold on the earth in the lives of these three two people 30 now Jesus was not yet coming into the town but was in that place where Martha met him the Jews were then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw Mary that she rose up hly and went out followed her saying she goes on to the Grave to weep then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him what did she do Martha came Martha was standing yeah because the Revelation didn't struck struck her early that after the Revelation she she left but Mary because she was already born again when she's approaching she's kneeling down yeah amen two different scenarios MH she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died I know a a few minutes kids give me 10 more minutes 8:30 the prophet of God says something in the the presence of God unrecognized he said first you've got to recognize him you might have a need but if you don't recognize him it would do you any good Marth Mary they had a need Lazarus was sick but did not recognize that this man was great more than a prophet but when they recognize it things were perfectly well they didn't even force it Jesus said where have you buried followed them and the prophet of God says that now when he is not recognized IED his power is always not revealed Marth and Mary did not recognize him when they were cooking for him when they were taking care of him and his power could not be released but when they did recognize him that he was the Christ the son of the Living God things start unfolding opening up for them and the the prophet of God says that when he is not recognized his power is always not revealed no matter how much God Is Standing present you've got to believe it some place he said you can do pennant 40 days you can fast for 40 days you can you can walk on on your knees you can do you can harm yourself he doesn't do you any good until you recognize him that's right he said like the woman with the blood issue all them people passing by all of them standing up saying there goes the rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a Prophet this is The Fanatic in all such uh as that but what happened this little woman had an issue of blood she had a need and she had heard about him and when she come down regardless of what anybody said said she recognized who he was that's that that made the difference everybody else was critici criticizing him some else believed that he was a prophet but her something struck her inside her said no no this is not a Prophet this is your creator this is the one who can who can create something new he created your body he created all that's inside of you he can create something new and when she come down there I read that she recognized who he was and she said if I can only touch His Garment but when she touched Jesus didn't feel it it was the heart her her faith that touched Jesus and the prophet of God says and when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing that's what what we need all of us amen that Faith within us let's let's let let it become a positive thing let it recognize him and become a positive thing and when it became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her and said your faith has saved you what did it faith faith after recognizing him other others standing there might have been sicker than she but you see she recognized his presence she know that was her opportunity in the prophet of God in the same message he goes he said if if we could only do that tonight I'm I'm winding down can we do that tonight can we recognize his presence in this little place where I'm standing here I have seen him speak to me day after day at this place I'm standing here I have seen him real this place than any other place amen have we recognized him don't look at the people that coming back here he might be fra sitting there but have you recognize him here could we do that tonight he said if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings he has been appearing to us if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose he said that that one purpose is to release our desires that we have in him to us it might sound a little bit too much it's to release our desires we have desires we have needs that we have in him that are within us he wants those to be released back to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word of this age is made manifest right not the promised word of of Moses age of any other ages the age of the word for this age let us stand there too much to go too many to go but as we in the message absolute preached 1963 the prophet of God says now we have times that we have great scholarships and nothing against that that's all right all that goes goes good but you personally have got to meet God amen amen because the love of God is personal to you amen he loves you more than you will ever know loves you more than you would ever know just him to allow you to be even attending this place maybe maybe you came by chance that's not a chance amen that's his great love his Supreme decision wanted you to be in this place amen that you can hear from Heaven directly don't don't look at the the the the man flesh here right but you personally have got to meet God to a place that no one can twist any scriptures you were there you were there Martha was there she sent somebody somebody came with a message she couldn't understand it she couldn't interpret it but that time she was there amen and something happened she didn't even ask for Jesus to go and raise up Lazarus because all became a reality you were there you you the one that met him don't let mother meet him for you amen don't let your father meet meet him for you or a sister or a husband a wife meet him personally you had the experience of it and you know him amen let's bow our heads precious Lord we thank you again father for allowing our mouth the mouth you created yourself to utter
