[5:04] as i hide
[5:08] oh in your
[5:41] it's a piece that the
[5:45] world cannot understand
[6:04] my
[6:11] let's all just stand
[6:14] you know before we sing this next song i
[6:16] just
[6:17] had something to read to you
[6:23] [Music]
[6:28] can you just play that song softly
[6:31] [Music]
[6:32] i don't know if anybody knows the story
[6:34] too much of
[6:35] this song
[6:37] [Music]
[6:43] the man who wrote it was named horatio
[6:45] spafford
[6:47] he was a presbyterian and he was a
[6:49] businessman
[6:51] um he owned property just north of
[6:53] chicago in 1871.
[6:56] he lost his four-year-old son to scarlet
[6:59] fever
[7:00] and just a few months later the chicago
[7:02] fire wiped his entire business
[7:04] investment out
[7:06] two years later he decided to take a
[7:09] european trip
[7:10] with dwight l moody to great britain
[7:14] but because of all the complications in
[7:15] the business he wasn't able to go on
[7:17] time and
[7:19] he sent his
[7:22] he sent his wife and his four daughters
[7:26] and as they're going across the ocean
[7:28] they struck a ship
[7:31] [Music]
[7:33] and the ship sank in 12 minutes
[7:35] [Music]
[7:36] 226 people lost their life including all
[7:39] four of his daughters
[7:41] [Music]
[7:43] his wife finally got back to the shore
[7:45] and in britain and
[7:48] telegram back two words saved alone
[7:53] i can only imagine the grief that he was
[7:55] going through
[7:58] so horatio decided to get a voyage and
[8:01] start going that way and
[8:03] as he got closer to the where his
[8:06] daughter's ship went down
[8:09] he started pinning the words it is well
[8:11] with my soul
[8:12] and he penned the words when sorrows
[8:16] like sea billows roll
[8:19] this hymn doesn't diminish or gloss over
[8:22] pain or tragedy
[8:24] but it proclaims that god is present in
[8:26] us
[8:27] and with us every single day
[8:30] psalms 46 1-3 said god is our refuge and
[8:34] strength
[8:35] a very present help and trouble
[8:37] therefore
[8:38] therefore will not we fear though the
[8:41] earth be removed
[8:42] though the mountains be carried in the
[8:44] midst of the sea
[8:45] so the waters therefore thereof roar and
[8:48] be troubled
[8:49] though the mountains shake with the
[8:50] swelling thereof selah
[8:54] my the perilous times that we have right
[8:57] now
[8:58] i wonder if we could just sing this song
[9:00] and just worship him because
[9:02] knowing it is well in my soul
[9:08] oh in peace
[9:34] road

[15:08] each another to feel that way
[15:13] it is well it's um
[15:16] um as we are standing up um let's just
[15:20] go straight to the word of god thank you
[15:23] brother franco for
[15:25] displaying
[15:28] the scripture one scripture we're gonna
[15:32] read
[15:34] revelation chapter eight
[15:42] verse 1 and when he had opened the
[15:45] seventh
[15:46] seal there was a silence in heaven
[15:50] above the space of an hour
[15:55] half an hour let me read it again
[15:59] and when he had opened the seventh hill
[16:01] there was a silence
[16:02] in heaven about the space of half
[16:05] an hour may god is at his blessing to
[16:08] the reading of the word
[16:11] let's pray heavenly father
[16:14] we went to school we know how to read
[16:18] but the context the revelation
[16:23] the inspiration must come from you
[16:26] because men are not coming to hear
[16:28] another man but they're coming to hear
[16:30] from you
[16:32] so come down in your power of
[16:34] resurrection
[16:36] and speak to our heart today father
[16:39] you know our needs there may be someone
[16:43] on the sidelines that need you today
[16:46] father and i want to just put myself
[16:49] aside
[16:50] and let you do what you need to do this
[16:53] morning
[16:54] we come with expectation there's so much
[16:57] going on father it takes
[17:01] you father to speak to your children
[17:04] no one else died for them you die on the
[17:07] cross for them
[17:09] no one paid the price you pay the price
[17:12] it's you father we just are being used
[17:16] as a tools we had tools in your hands
[17:20] please come down and do
[17:23] your perfect will with us this morning
[17:26] in jesus christ's name we prayed amen
[17:30] you may be seated
[17:35] ah
[17:40] it's a really unprecedented time
[17:44] it's an amazing time
[17:48] um the symbolic
[17:51] the symbology is just amazing too
[17:56] we live in a time where companies are
[17:58] telling us to go home
[18:01] to work from home and
[18:04] the deaf angel is going around
[18:10] killing anybody that he can find so they
[18:13] say go
[18:14] home that sounds like a gaussian to me
[18:19] and we all have to be inside
[18:22] and make sure that in the inoculated
[18:26] blood is on the post
[18:30] wow and the first
[18:33] born are making sure that the dad
[18:36] did just that dad are you sure the blood
[18:40] is
[18:40] applied well the deaf angel that is
[18:44] going
[18:44] out today is killing the flesh
[18:47] is killing the body
[18:50] but uh in this time the death
[18:54] angel purpose is to kill the soul
[18:59] therefore it's important we can say it
[19:02] is well
[19:03] it is well in my soul
[19:08] we got the inaugurate blood of jesus
[19:11] christ
[19:12] the virus can kill but he kills the body
[19:16] it doesn't kill me i am inside there
[19:20] amen so uh
[19:24] during this time too i receive
[19:28] a census bureau letter
[19:31] telling me to fill up and go on the
[19:34] website
[19:35] and fill up about everybody that
[19:38] lives in my house what a symbology again
[19:42] in the time where jesus was to be born
[19:47] everybody had to go home
[19:50] and do the senses during the time when
[19:53] everybody goes home
[19:55] there's a census because jesus must be
[19:58] born
[20:00] it's just amazing
[20:05] hallelujah what a time we we're living
[20:08] in
[20:09] it feels like the song that says the day
[20:13] of redemption is near
[20:15] i will say is here the day of redemption
[20:19] is here return you
[20:22] disperse to your own everything is
[20:26] telling us to go
[20:27] home to return to our home to our land
[20:32] and we were buried in a certain land
[20:35] the name of the lord jesus christ and he
[20:39] is the word right return
[20:42] time to return to feel that is
[20:45] well in my soul amen
[20:50] this morning i want to talk about
[20:53] um what is in
[20:56] silence
[20:59] what is in the silence we just read
[21:05] this scripture revelation chapter 8
[21:09] disclaimer i'm not quite preaching on
[21:14] seals
[21:16] but let me touch a little bit that
[21:21] uh what is in the silence
[21:26] we find out that when the seals were
[21:28] open
[21:31] there was a symbol coming out there was
[21:34] a voice
[21:36] there was an activity taking place
[21:39] but when this last seal is
[21:42] open there is a silence
[21:46] there is no symbol there is no
[21:50] voice or sound there is no
[21:53] activity and
[21:57] brother branham read another scripture
[22:01] revelation chapter 10
[22:07] and revelation chapter 10 and i saw
[22:11] another mighty angel come down from
[22:13] heaven
[22:14] cloth with a cloud and then rainbow was
[22:17] upon his head and his face was as
[22:20] it were the sun and his feet as the
[22:23] pillars of fire
[22:25] and he had in his hand a little book
[22:27] open and he set his
[22:29] right foot upon the sea and his left
[22:32] foot
[22:32] on the earth and he cried out
[22:37] let me go there and he cried out
[22:40] i cried with a loud voice as when
[22:43] a lion roareth and when he cried
[22:46] seven thunders uttered the voices and
[22:50] when the seven thunders had
[22:52] had their voices i was about to write
[22:55] and i
[22:56] heard a voice from heaven saying
[22:59] unto me sit up those things which the
[23:02] seven thunders uttered
[23:04] and write them not and i will just stop
[23:08] there
[23:09] and go back what is
[23:12] in this silence the prophet tells us
[23:18] that yes
[23:21] each seal had a symbol a voice
[23:25] and something that's taking place but
[23:28] this one
[23:28] is just a silence and we want to know
[23:31] what is in silence
[23:33] because otherwise he will not be put in
[23:35] the bible
[23:36] just for us to say there was a silence
[23:39] and that's all no there is something and
[23:42] that
[23:43] something must be very important it's
[23:46] not just for knowledge
[23:48] but it has something for the bride to
[23:51] catch
[23:53] now brother branham gave us his first
[23:57] interpretation of the silence in the
[24:00] message the seventh seal
[24:02] and he say and now as certain as i stand
[24:05] in the platform
[24:06] tonight i had the revelation that
[24:09] revealed
[24:10] it's in a three-fold manner
[24:13] that i will speak to you by god's help
[24:16] of of a fault of it and then
[24:20] you let's go over that first
[24:23] here is the revelation to begin what i
[24:26] want to tell you
[24:27] what it is what happened is those seven
[24:31] thunders that he heard thunder and was
[24:34] forbidden to write
[24:36] that's what the mystery is laying
[24:39] behind those seven consecutive
[24:43] thunders rolling out
[24:46] so he's telling us first revelation
[24:49] in in this silence where nothing
[24:53] is said no symbol nothing
[24:57] will that silence
[25:00] the the revelation chapter 10
[25:03] with the seven thunders actually
[25:06] uh uh the seven thunders
[25:10] speaks about that silence amen
[25:14] in other words is telling us that uh the
[25:17] silence has a voice and the voice is the
[25:20] seventh hundredths
[25:22] amen my brother when i'm uh
[25:25] here is knock on the puppet several
[25:28] times
[25:29] to talk about the seven thunders and say
[25:32] now why
[25:33] let us prove it why is the secret that
[25:36] no one
[25:37] knows about what is the secret that no
[25:40] one knows about
[25:43] john was forbidden to write about it
[25:46] even
[25:46] write a symbol about it why
[25:49] this is why there was no activity
[25:53] in heaven it might give away the secret
[25:57] do you see it now so he's telling us
[26:00] that
[26:01] uh the uh
[26:04] the silence uh is about
[26:08] what john was forbidden to write
[26:11] in other words he's telling us the
[26:14] silence in revelation chapter 8
[26:16] is actually revelation chapter 10.
[26:20] one is in symbol or in
[26:24] no symbol in a silence the other one has
[26:27] a voice
[26:28] so basically the prophet is telling us
[26:31] that
[26:32] revelation chapter 8 equal
[26:35] revelation 10. amen
[26:39] so there is a voice in the silence
[26:43] amen when nothing is written something
[26:46] is written
[26:47] but it takes the prophet to show us what
[26:50] is not written
[26:52] it takes the prophet to take some some
[26:54] bar
[26:55] some sharp object and cut the head of
[26:58] the pyramid
[27:00] and show us a white white stone that
[27:03] no sun has a shine on and
[27:06] tell us that what is not written is this
[27:11] and it must be very important it's just
[27:14] not just
[27:15] for our knowledge it must be critical
[27:17] because it looks like the bride
[27:20] has to catch the silence
[27:22] [Applause]
[27:24] amen amen
[27:28] it says it was a silence theologians
[27:32] when they come here they say
[27:33] there was a silence and that's it
[27:38] because other other seals they can
[27:41] try to mimic something try to
[27:44] tell you it's about love
[27:48] the the horseman is going to to conquer
[27:51] love and all that but when you get to
[27:54] this one
[27:55] they say it was a silence
[28:00] i heard the denomination of men saying
[28:02] that
[28:03] i i guess he was joking he said there
[28:05] were no women in heaven
[28:08] that was not good
[28:12] yeah because they don't know they
[28:15] they try to make up something
[28:19] now revelation chapter 8
[28:22] the silent has actually a sound
[28:30] are you with me i'm just keep building
[28:33] it
[28:34] i'm not speaking about seals and i'm
[28:36] going to go out on
[28:38] a limb i'm going to feel a little bit
[28:41] free even though i'm nervous but i won't
[28:44] care about that
[28:47] building a little foundation to
[28:51] share with you a thought so when
[28:54] somebody share with you a thought
[28:56] you know i need the disclaimer to tell
[28:58] you i'm sharing this thought with you
[29:01] about what what i felt god given to me
[29:05] and i want to share with you now
[29:08] um revelation
[29:11] 8 sound there is no sound
[29:15] it's a silence symbol no symbol
[29:18] no activity silent
[29:22] but the prophet said to us it's
[29:24] revelation 10.
[29:26] that's where the symbols are that's
[29:28] where the voice is
[29:30] there is a symbol there are more than
[29:32] one symbol there the
[29:33] lion is rolling sound seven thunders
[29:38] uh uttering the voice there is a sound
[29:41] there is an activity and that
[29:43] activity we know is the secret coming
[29:47] of the lord
[29:50] is that right but it was all in
[29:53] silence and god knew
[29:56] that you and i need this so god
[30:00] made sure to give us a prophet who can
[30:03] read where nothing is written
[30:08] and silence doesn't mean there is no
[30:10] activity
[30:12] you hear barbara say that at the
[30:13] beginning when he's reading the symbol
[30:16] and he say silence no activity
[30:19] then it will show us that actually there
[30:21] is activity
[30:23] there is the coming of the lord the
[30:26] secret coming
[30:27] of the lord there is something there but
[30:30] it takes a prophet to go and see it
[30:33] and read what is not written
[30:39] but i'm saying that silence is showing
[30:42] silence doesn't mean
[30:43] no activity you say great things happen
[30:46] in the silence
[30:47] it's a great things are quite
[30:51] things in the message what the does
[30:54] thou hear did you know that friends
[30:57] listen the sun which gives life on the
[31:00] earth
[31:01] to every living thing in botany
[31:05] uh plant life botany life
[31:08] plant life three life whatever more
[31:11] it brings forth life the sun does and it
[31:14] can
[31:15] draw a million gallons of water from the
[31:18] earth
[31:20] you've been reading faster than me i
[31:22] know
[31:23] i caught you yeah
[31:26] now and make less
[31:30] noise then we can get a back full out of
[31:34] a pump
[31:35] but i don't say that but we can i can
[31:37] just ask somebody give me some water
[31:40] and i will hear so much noise just a cup
[31:44] of water
[31:44] what is that noise um is the dishwasher
[31:48] uh what is but god moved tons
[31:51] of tons of water from the
[31:54] earth in complete silence
[31:58] you see it's a big thing quiet things
[32:01] are big things
[32:03] did you hear did you ever hear the world
[32:05] turning did you ever
[32:07] hear the planets as they passed through
[32:10] the orbit
[32:11] do you ever hear one that's the big
[32:14] things
[32:15] did you ever hear the sun rise
[32:18] so silence doesn't mean nothing is
[32:21] happening
[32:22] great things actually happen in the
[32:24] silence
[32:26] amen
[32:31] now we'll continue brother when i'm
[32:33] explaining to us the silence of this
[32:36] the revelation chapter 8 in the message
[32:39] christ
[32:40] is the mystery of god reveal
[32:43] it's a god great mystery and how it's
[32:48] a secret he kept it a secret
[32:51] nobody knew know nothing about it
[32:55] even the angels did not understand it
[32:57] see
[32:58] he did not reveal it that's the reason
[33:01] under our
[33:02] seventh mystery when the seventh sea was
[33:05] open
[33:06] there was a silence and then he started
[33:09] explaining what was in that silence
[33:11] jesus when he was on
[33:13] earth they wanted to know when he would
[33:16] come
[33:17] so there is that activity right there
[33:21] it was hidden in this island they want
[33:24] to know when jesus is
[33:26] coming and he say
[33:29] he said he's he said it's
[33:33] even the son himself don't know when
[33:36] it's going to happen see god has this
[33:39] all to himself it's a secret
[33:42] and that the reason there was a silence
[33:44] in heaven
[33:45] for a space of half an hour um
[33:49] and seven thunders after their voices in
[33:51] john was
[33:52] even forbidden to write it see the
[33:56] coming of the lord what is in the
[33:59] silence
[33:59] there is a coming of the lord a secret
[34:03] coming of the lord in israel
[34:06] [Applause]
[34:08] it takes a prophet to do that that's one
[34:11] thing he has not revealed yet
[34:13] and how it will come and when
[34:16] he will come it's a good thing that it
[34:19] does it and
[34:20] no if you listen at the tape very
[34:23] closely brother branham takes
[34:25] a pose he poses there he has not
[34:28] revealed it
[34:30] he he has not revealed it yet how he
[34:33] will
[34:34] come when he will come
[34:37] no no i don't see ministers
[34:41] make a big no it should be a big no
[34:44] because he's telling us
[34:45] he say that he didn't tell us how he
[34:48] will come
[34:49] how he will do it and then he will say
[34:52] no
[34:53] and then he will start going to
[34:56] actually he revealed it
[35:02] it didn't show it he didn't say about he
[35:05] didn't say anything about it
[35:07] there was a silent no
[35:11] he did amen
[35:14] i think you should say it in a british
[35:17] english no he said it
[35:24] that was my only british english that i
[35:28] it was he has showed and revealed it
[35:32] in every type that is in the bible
[35:36] therefore the entire bible is the
[35:38] revelation of god
[35:40] mystery in christ huh
[35:43] the entire bible is an expression of
[35:46] one goal that god had one purpose he
[35:49] wanted to achieve in the entire bible
[35:54] i want you to notice that uh i
[35:57] highlighted
[35:59] how is show it in every type
[36:03] in the bible i highlight it because
[36:07] basically what he is saying to me is
[36:11] that this silence
[36:15] is in a type that you see in the bible
[36:18] there is a there is the public reading
[36:22] the public
[36:23] message to people when we look at david
[36:28] when we look at moses we look at
[36:31] all this character in the bible
[36:35] god hide hid
[36:39] is a mystery in this
[36:42] uh in this characters
[36:46] that's very important
[36:51] now let's continue here and say and all
[36:55] the acts of the
[36:56] uh of the believers in the bible has
[37:00] been
[37:00] in type and expressing
[37:03] that god great goal is
[37:07] and now in this last day it has to
[37:10] reveal it and show it
[37:12] and god and god's help we will see
[37:16] will sit right here this morning what
[37:19] the lord
[37:20] has had in his mind all along and
[37:23] has expressed it
[37:26] so this is actually where
[37:29] i was trying to build my foundation
[37:33] to show you that the
[37:36] there is a public
[37:40] part so when you we read the scripture
[37:43] we see there is a two part in the
[37:46] scriptures
[37:48] took part in the types of the bible
[37:51] you know two parts one is spoken
[37:55] the other one is silent and god
[37:58] wants us and these days if you have
[38:01] noticed
[38:02] god is walking us through scriptures
[38:06] and bring to our
[38:09] view what is actually written
[38:13] behind all this character behind the
[38:15] roots
[38:16] behind enoch behind david
[38:20] and it's very it's so critical for us to
[38:23] see those things they are not just
[38:27] for our knowledge
[38:30] but actually great things happen in the
[38:34] silence
[38:35] and the elect cut cut
[38:39] the silence if you are the elect
[38:42] you don't read the the bible
[38:45] the word like a newspaper but you catch
[38:49] the
[38:49] silence behind it and that's very
[38:52] critical amen
[38:58] yes
[39:11] so all the types in the bible and
[39:14] people go to church they read the
[39:17] scripture
[39:20] everybody read it they always seen it
[39:23] but we need
[39:26] to for the elect it is
[39:30] to to read the silence that's
[39:33] written behind that and that's what
[39:36] actually makes the difference
[39:40] you know let me just give you a little
[39:42] example here
[39:44] you know the woman um the tennessee
[39:47] woman
[39:49] the story of the tennessee woman
[39:53] this woman grounded by the branham
[39:57] airplane you remember the story
[40:00] but what happened to her she always
[40:03] goes to church they read
[40:06] the the bible they read this story
[40:10] of the shunammite woman they read the
[40:13] public
[40:15] portion of that message but
[40:18] she did not read it that way she
[40:22] look at this story she looks at the
[40:24] story
[40:25] and suddenly she sees the silence behind
[40:29] the story
[40:31] and then she say i am that
[40:34] shunammite woman because god does not do
[40:38] exception of person i i did not have a
[40:42] child
[40:43] i prayed to the lord he gave me a child
[40:47] man then the child grew up and
[40:50] went with the bad crowd and then
[40:54] now is dying with a social uh
[40:57] disease and i
[41:01] am the shunammite woman in the bible so
[41:04] the bible was not just
[41:06] written so that we can have a good thing
[41:09] to to read
[41:10] she actually caught the silence
[41:14] behind the written word of god
[41:18] and then she say since i am the
[41:21] shunamite woman
[41:24] where is elijah
[41:27] and when she say that in her world
[41:30] elijah did not exist i want you to
[41:33] understand
[41:34] that in her world there was no elijah
[41:37] she never heard about buddha branham
[41:39] nothing about by the brain
[41:42] no elijah she read it but she's so more
[41:45] than what is
[41:46] written she saw the silence then
[41:50] she called into existence
[41:53] elijah because he was not there
[41:58] is that right and elijah came yeah
[42:02] and and she she's actually asking
[42:05] brother brandon
[42:06] brenner and she's asking him i saw you
[42:09] had your suitcase with you
[42:11] how did this you know i'm saying yes
[42:13] it's true it's true i left it in the
[42:15] hotel
[42:17] she called elijah in
[42:21] in existence because she was able to
[42:25] read the
[42:25] silence that is behind the written world
[42:30] and that's what we need to get to
[42:33] because otherwise it's going to be
[42:36] christianity
[42:38] otherwise it will be just the system
[42:41] it's good we come to church is very
[42:44] important it's a critical
[42:46] but we have to go beyond that
[42:49] we have to go beyond the daily routine
[42:53] of doing
[42:53] this and doing that all the things are
[42:56] important
[42:57] but until and unless
[43:01] we read and listen to the silence
[43:05] we still a nominal christian
[43:09] but i want all to be well
[43:13] in my soul
[43:16] and it cannot just be by by the
[43:20] public portion
[43:23] it got to come to the private portion
[43:26] of the scripture now when
[43:30] you read the book you read the malachi
[43:33] 4 look this woman read
[43:36] malachi 4 before us behold i will
[43:39] send you elijah the prophet before the
[43:43] the coming of great and dreadful day of
[43:46] the lord
[43:48] that's how we read it all the time god
[43:50] sent the prophet
[43:52] god's in the prophet god's in the
[43:54] prophet
[43:55] god send a prophet not good enough
[43:57] [Music]
[43:59] now we gotta go into the silence of it
[44:03] god send you i
[44:08] will send you we always
[44:11] drop the you and we forget that
[44:15] elijah could not come without you
[44:19] so when you read grammatically
[44:23] you see you comes before elijah
[44:27] so who is the most important is you
[44:30] and who's you is the bride
[44:36] who is more important is the bride
[44:40] elijah is only sent to her
[44:45] is that right yeah the more we look at
[44:48] the word of god the more we look at the
[44:51] word of god
[44:52] we see christ the more we look at christ
[44:55] the word the more we look at it we
[44:58] must see ourself it is a silenced
[45:02] portion
[45:02] of the world it's critical
[45:07] amen
[45:14] brother branham agreed with a doctor
[45:18] doctor scofield you know him right
[45:22] we go we all have this bible but
[45:26] he says something very important very
[45:29] good and by the way i agree with him
[45:31] in the message is this the sign of the
[45:33] end time
[45:34] he said the mystery here here
[45:37] is the mystery a mystery is scripture
[45:42] is a previously hidden it's true now
[45:45] revealed by which but which is a
[45:49] supernatural
[45:50] element still remains despite the
[45:53] revelation
[45:54] that's where we want to go we want to go
[45:57] to that
[45:58] supernatural element that isn't a
[46:01] scripture
[46:03] we don't want to just read the public
[46:05] one
[46:06] so otherwise uh you know when
[46:10] you get to the silence of the scripture
[46:13] it gives you fear
[46:16] it gives you fear which is the reverence
[46:21] you will not say it you will not do
[46:24] it because a man called branham did it
[46:27] but because god convinced you that
[46:30] i send him for you
[46:34] [Music]
[46:36] it becomes a person of things
[46:39] and this is very important right now
[46:42] more than ever we see everything
[46:46] coming together the world is
[46:49] crumbling this is a time
[46:53] where children of god has to go home
[46:57] in your own land the land of the name of
[47:01] the lord jesus christ the word
[47:04] back to the word but not just the
[47:07] reading of the word
[47:08] the hidden part that revelation that is
[47:12] hidden is given to you personally
[47:18] therefore i'm not saying but a child
[47:20] preaches no
[47:23] the same i know but i'm saying no matter
[47:26] how much i am anointed you must
[47:29] be anointed too
[47:32] therefore god will speak to me in my
[47:35] house
[47:36] when i come here god will repeat it
[47:39] in but a child's mouth it will not be
[47:43] him
[47:44] i heard the silence portion of that word
[47:48] it's critical
[48:03] what about a mixer strange
[48:06] declaration if you ever notice
[48:10] he say the preaching of the gospel
[48:14] blind have you heard him
[48:18] what gospel the bible the scripture
[48:24] yeah is talking about the letters
[48:27] the blind people that's why you say the
[48:31] oral roberts let me read it
[48:34] he said putting on the all the whole
[48:38] armor of god
[48:39] he said two of them more than billy
[48:42] graham and
[48:43] oral roberts they went to uh
[48:46] sodom right his message went down into
[48:50] sodom
[48:51] preaching the word blinding them with
[48:53] the word
[48:54] to disbelieved to disbelieve the word
[48:57] you are blind the preaching of the
[49:00] gospel blind the
[49:02] unbeliever and that's what billy graham
[49:06] and those great evangelists are doing
[49:08] blinding taking people
[49:12] by preaching well it's the bible they
[49:15] preach
[49:17] but what does it do it brings them it
[49:20] binds them together
[49:22] to go into the ecumenism
[49:26] but yet they preach the word yes that's
[49:30] why we
[49:31] cannot stay just like that because
[49:34] god did not do it for the elect
[49:37] you see he said but there was one that
[49:40] stayed with abraham the elect and what
[49:44] he did was to read the silence
[49:48] to abraham will i hide the thing to
[49:51] abraham
[49:52] is a friend we need to hear
[49:56] that it has to be personal
[49:59] for the believer the word the word
[50:02] the water of the world if it's just the
[50:06] scriptures
[50:07] if it's just the writing they don't help
[50:11] some things have to go with it
[50:15] something a mystery
[50:18] a silent part
[50:24] you know brother abraham abraham used to
[50:27] say i wish i was a preacher
[50:29] this is the time where i wish i was a
[50:31] preacher
[50:33] and when he say it i know what he means
[50:36] i know i know i i wish at this time i'd
[50:39] be brought a chat
[50:40] because i will show it this way we show
[50:42] it that way i will go this way do you
[50:44] still see it
[50:45] do you see i hide it see it
[50:50] and it will still make sense
[50:54] amen amen for the elect god said
[50:59] goes into the secret speak to them
[51:02] things that really don't make sense
[51:06] that's why the elect doesn't have to go
[51:10] and find out what happened the cloud
[51:14] the bridge because god has already
[51:18] spoken to you
[51:19] the in the silence he said shh
[51:23] it's i
[51:26] so it's not somebody that i have to go
[51:30] investigated
[51:31] here and there why did this happen that
[51:34] happened
[51:34] no god spoke to me the same
[51:37] angel of the lord that was sent to
[51:40] william branham
[51:41] spoke to me all the same spirit that was
[51:45] anointing william branham anointing me
[51:48] therefore i don't have that time and
[51:52] when the
[51:52] when the pastor preaches or a minister
[51:55] preaches
[51:56] the same anointing on that the preacher
[52:00] is on me that's why i don't ask you the
[52:02] word of god i don't have that strength
[52:05] to argue the word of god
[52:14] otherwise what's going to happen church
[52:19] it is what the prophet speaks about
[52:22] when he went in the wood one day
[52:26] he went in a wood let him talk about it
[52:30] he say here how can i overcome you say i
[52:33] was crossing an
[52:34] old log the other day down
[52:38] a washing what is called a hollow
[52:41] and i jumped up on this log on the
[52:45] outside it looked good
[52:47] looked like a big old bleach log
[52:51] but when i jumped on it oh a great chunk
[52:54] of it
[52:55] fell off it was rotten and daddy
[52:59] say that's the way the christians are
[53:01] becoming
[53:03] they dead in sin and trespasses so long
[53:06] till
[53:07] becoming dirty they can hold no weight
[53:10] at all they don't know what the
[53:14] overcoming means
[53:17] so think about this this lock
[53:20] this piece of wood or the piece of tree
[53:24] if it had germatized
[53:28] if he had received that portion that is
[53:31] hidden it would have germatized
[53:35] it will be strong but right now
[53:38] he receive all the water of the world
[53:42] day in day out it becomes
[53:45] soft therefore
[53:48] i say to all elected go
[53:51] back to your own return oh
[53:56] you the dispersed to your own
[53:59] your own is not necessary the church the
[54:03] local church
[54:04] although it is important but
[54:07] return to your own return to
[54:11] receive life otherwise the more you
[54:14] receive
[54:15] life without life inside
[54:19] you become soft
[54:23] god help us i want to
[54:26] sing with you brother ben it's well
[54:30] in my soul as well in my soul
[54:34] but the more we spend time in the
[54:36] message
[54:37] people like us we came to the message
[54:40] today
[54:43] god revealed this message to us when i
[54:46] was
[54:47] 21 years old
[54:51] now young people i'm almost 60
[54:56] very old oh they want to collapse
[55:01] give them an aspirin no
[55:05] the more we spend time in the message
[55:08] without that thing to take place
[55:12] the life to take place
[55:16] it becomes dirty soft
[55:19] is is scary as we see
[55:23] all the signs
[55:26] we can't afford to keep going the way we
[55:30] did
[55:31] we can't afford the system anymore
[55:35] it's time we go back go back the senses
[55:40] is out there the angel of death is out
[55:43] there
[55:43] let me go back home and
[55:47] go back to the word jesus christ
[55:50] is the word but the word revealed to me
[55:54] personally
[55:57] i don't want to go round and round you
[55:59] see i was talking about how long i've
[56:01] been
[56:02] there how long 81
[56:05] do the math hit ah wow how long
[56:08] have been in the message and that's very
[56:12] dangerous
[56:13] if life is doesn't take place
[56:16] it become even worse because after we
[56:19] leave
[56:20] you hear the word you hear the word you
[56:23] live here you you start
[56:26] hearing but the the pastor just spoke
[56:29] about this
[56:31] why why you what is why do you have this
[56:34] attitude
[56:35] we just heard it were you in the church
[56:38] maybe you were not in the right church
[56:41] my church is over there
[56:42] i don't know
[56:46] well what is going on but the good thing
[56:49] is
[56:50] god is correcting all of us even when i
[56:53] see
[56:53] a brother who was here listening to the
[56:56] word
[56:57] and is acting maybe they spoke about the
[57:01] criticism and things like that and after
[57:05] we leave
[57:05] here it comes out of their mouth now i
[57:08] know
[57:09] by what we heard is not them against
[57:13] us it's my duty to make sure
[57:17] this brother or this sister go
[57:20] goes back in line come back
[57:23] go home it's my duty now i don't i don't
[57:26] have to do it
[57:27] selfishly i understand it's the part of
[57:30] the body
[57:31] i had to cry out for the sins that are
[57:35] committed
[57:36] in the city therefore i have to bring
[57:39] everyone that is still acting this way
[57:42] to the lord because there is no more
[57:46] [Applause]
[57:52] time
[57:55] verbum continues here in uh that the
[57:58] same message
[58:00] and he say when he look at that log he
[58:03] start
[58:03] thinking about his message and i begin
[58:06] to think of this message
[58:08] then overcome keep life in you
[58:12] when life went out that's what brought
[58:15] that log
[58:15] to that condition see it made it worse
[58:18] than ever
[58:19] when it laid in the branch where the
[58:22] water
[58:22] where the water was and then there
[58:26] you you take a christian that's supposed
[58:29] to be a christian
[58:30] let the life of god go from him
[58:33] and the experience the joy of serving
[58:36] christ and living in the church where
[58:39] such a thing is going on
[58:43] erupts erotic twice as quick
[58:46] right living right under the more we
[58:50] hear the word and the level
[58:53] the word has gotten
[58:57] church if nothing changes
[59:01] we're gonna get worse
[59:05] it's time for us to pose is
[59:08] time for us to do like they did in
[59:11] goshen
[59:13] is the blood of life
[59:17] it's no longer the the religion of my
[59:20] father and mother
[59:22] is mine i gotta pause and
[59:25] go into the silence with the lord
[59:28] and say i am tired of following
[59:32] my parents now you gotta talk to me
[59:36] it has to talk to your heart i'm not
[59:39] talking about there's any supernatural
[59:41] something
[59:41] you can do it but i'm talking about
[59:44] down there where the secret
[59:48] is
[59:58] you know the story of uh rebecca eliza
[1:00:05] let me just read the portion of it
[1:00:08] genesis chapter 24
[1:00:17] eliezer was concerned
[1:00:21] he was concerned the woman will not be
[1:00:24] willing to follow me
[1:00:26] maybe she will not be she will not want
[1:00:29] to be called
[1:00:30] um uh branamite
[1:00:34] um you following amen
[1:00:39] so you say this is a problem if the
[1:00:42] woman doesn't want to
[1:00:44] follow me and the servant
[1:00:47] the serpent as the servant said unto him
[1:00:52] per adventure the woman will not be
[1:00:54] willing to follow me unto this land
[1:00:58] the land of the name of the lord jesus
[1:01:02] the land of the message the land of the
[1:01:05] world we heard the message
[1:01:06] is not easy it's like a big marble
[1:01:10] stone rock yeah
[1:01:14] will she be willing
[1:01:17] and must must i need to bring thy
[1:01:20] son again unto the land from whence thou
[1:01:23] comest
[1:01:25] and abram said unto him beware
[1:01:28] thou thou that thou bring not
[1:01:32] my son tyler again
[1:01:37] the lord of heaven
[1:01:40] which took me from my father's house
[1:01:43] and from the land of my kindred which
[1:01:46] speak unto me
[1:01:47] and thus swear unto me saying unto thy
[1:01:51] seed will i give this land
[1:01:53] he shall send his angel before thee
[1:01:56] and thou shalt take a wife unto my son
[1:02:00] from tents and if the woman will not be
[1:02:03] willing to follow thee
[1:02:06] then thou shalt be clear from this oath
[1:02:10] only bring not my son tither again
[1:02:13] and the servant put his hand under the
[1:02:16] tie of
[1:02:17] abram his master and swear to him
[1:02:20] concerning that matter
[1:02:24] the servant eli israel
[1:02:28] was still concerned he want to make sure
[1:02:32] that the woman that i will pick will be
[1:02:34] the one that
[1:02:36] god has in his mind for isaac
[1:02:40] so he's going to pray anyhow
[1:02:43] so uh genesis 20 24
[1:02:46] 10 and the servant took 10 camels
[1:02:50] of the camels of his master and departed
[1:02:53] for
[1:02:53] all the goods of his master
[1:02:56] were in his hand and he aroused
[1:03:00] and went to mesopotamia unto the city of
[1:03:04] neho and he made his cameras to kneel
[1:03:08] down with
[1:03:09] without the city by a well of water
[1:03:12] at the time of the evening even the
[1:03:16] time that women go out to draw water you
[1:03:20] can see
[1:03:20] symbolism everywhere but i cannot get to
[1:03:24] that
[1:03:25] now it's all over the place now
[1:03:29] and he say verse 12
[1:03:32] and he said oh lord god of
[1:03:35] my master abraham i pray
[1:03:38] thee send me good speed
[1:03:43] this day and show kindness unto my
[1:03:46] master
[1:03:47] abraham behold i stand here by the well
[1:03:50] of water and the daughters of men
[1:03:52] of the city come out to draw water
[1:03:55] and let it come to pass that the damsel
[1:03:58] to whom
[1:03:59] i so say let down thy picture
[1:04:02] i pray thee that i may drink
[1:04:05] and she shall say drink and i will
[1:04:09] give this camel's drink also let the
[1:04:12] same be
[1:04:13] she that thou has appointed for thy
[1:04:16] servant
[1:04:16] isaac and thereby shall i know that that
[1:04:19] has show
[1:04:20] kindness unto my master
[1:04:25] which i want to say let
[1:04:28] let think let
[1:04:32] think that this
[1:04:37] the eliza did not just
[1:04:40] uh speak to one
[1:04:44] girl let's just say that
[1:04:48] there were a few girls coming just for
[1:04:50] the to dramatize it a little bit
[1:04:53] so a girl comes to
[1:04:57] fetch the water and eliza says
[1:05:01] okay um can you give me some water to
[1:05:04] drink
[1:05:05] and she said okay
[1:05:08] she did something really good
[1:05:11] okay i'll give it to you she gave
[1:05:15] her devotion
[1:05:18] she went to church
[1:05:21] she did everything that uh we do
[1:05:25] she paid her ties and
[1:05:29] offering and she sings
[1:05:32] she did all the things that we do
[1:05:37] but yet that was not her
[1:05:41] until rebecca comes what was different
[1:05:44] with rebecca every other girl
[1:05:49] heard the public portion
[1:05:52] of the world but rebecca
[1:05:56] heard the silent one
[1:06:00] remember heard what is
[1:06:03] was not spoken
[1:06:07] everybody heard what was spoken
[1:06:11] give me uh lay down your peach
[1:06:15] peach picture and i'm going to
[1:06:18] drink from it but rebecca heard the
[1:06:21] what was not saying what was in the
[1:06:25] silence
[1:06:26] she heard it do you see why critic it is
[1:06:30] critical you know
[1:06:32] if she did not hear what
[1:06:35] was in silence she would have given
[1:06:39] to eliza water which is good
[1:06:42] what is nice what this is what we
[1:06:46] do we come to church we have a devotion
[1:06:50] we do everything right
[1:06:54] but there is one step that we have to
[1:06:56] take
[1:06:57] and that is critical she heard
[1:07:00] what was not spoken and that's
[1:07:04] how the elect is you catch god
[1:07:08] mind for something it's not just what
[1:07:12] what people said but you catch
[1:07:16] god mind and you come out you say
[1:07:20] god spoke to me today but i was in a
[1:07:23] church
[1:07:24] too yeah you didn't get the silence
[1:07:28] god told me to stop doing this
[1:07:31] to stop wearing this but i was in a
[1:07:34] church
[1:07:36] i have my opinion yes but
[1:07:40] there is a silence in what was being
[1:07:43] preached
[1:07:44] preachers we make a lot of noise but
[1:07:47] what
[1:07:47] count is the silence
[1:07:50] amen that's exactly right
[1:07:57] she got what eliza
[1:08:01] did not want to say openly
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:06] you see i'm quoting brother branham
[1:08:08] somehow
[1:08:12] yes sometimes we
[1:08:16] they are sometimes when we just hear the
[1:08:19] message
[1:08:20] we look at the person who give the
[1:08:22] message
[1:08:23] sometimes we can kind of even judge the
[1:08:26] person who gave the message
[1:08:28] sometimes we feel like what do you think
[1:08:31] you are better than us
[1:08:33] but i'm just being very uh
[1:08:36] blind yeah
[1:08:39] do you think you better than us but
[1:08:43] if god has spoken to you you can't never
[1:08:46] say that
[1:08:48] right that's why it's very important
[1:08:52] by the end of the service you will
[1:08:53] unders you will love the silence
[1:08:56] good things happen the silence when you
[1:08:59] go to your knees
[1:09:00] in your closet great thing happened then
[1:09:04] when you come out of it great thing has
[1:09:08] already happened
[1:09:09] people just see the manifestation of the
[1:09:12] silence
[1:09:14] in the closet it's critical to have that
[1:09:17] time
[1:09:18] when when the message preached to us
[1:09:22] is about love ah those messages were
[1:09:27] wonderful but if we take it
[1:09:32] just like because it was said
[1:09:35] after a while it's going to be
[1:09:39] difficult after a while when attitudes
[1:09:43] don't change
[1:09:44] and all that is going to be difficult
[1:09:48] you start feeling like people are taking
[1:09:51] advantage of me
[1:09:53] because when we go to church the pastor
[1:09:56] speaks about
[1:09:57] love and this it starts taking a toll on
[1:10:01] you
[1:10:02] but you need to hear through the silence
[1:10:08] then you'll be no problem god say that
[1:10:11] to me
[1:10:12] amen i struggle too with the
[1:10:16] love message i struggle in the past
[1:10:20] i i preach long time and
[1:10:24] actually i start preaching almost the
[1:10:26] age of my son
[1:10:28] enoch and you struggle with this
[1:10:32] because it doesn't make it doesn't sound
[1:10:36] right
[1:10:37] and when love is being preached yeah let
[1:10:40] just preach about it the way the prophet
[1:10:44] says it
[1:10:45] and let's talk about affection
[1:10:48] friendship
[1:10:49] and all that caring about each other
[1:10:52] it's what the church does but that's not
[1:10:55] the
[1:10:55] love that god wants us to get to
[1:10:59] as the so now it's it was a struggle for
[1:11:04] me
[1:11:05] you know and but god is
[1:11:08] opening the hidden portion of
[1:11:12] scripture that we have always read
[1:11:16] it do you see his church do you see his
[1:11:20] mighty hand every day we come to church
[1:11:24] god using any of his ministers is
[1:11:27] just opening something but we always
[1:11:30] read it yeah you were reading the public
[1:11:33] one
[1:11:34] but when you have a life that is
[1:11:36] dedicated
[1:11:37] consecrated you pray you come with
[1:11:39] expectation
[1:11:41] then god start opening this portion that
[1:11:43] silence portion is
[1:11:45] very important amen
[1:11:51] then i heard something that i was
[1:11:53] talking about
[1:11:54] without giving a definition i heard
[1:11:56] about capstone love
[1:11:59] love based on understanding based on
[1:12:04] love of understanding based on the
[1:12:06] revelations
[1:12:08] aha that's exactly right
[1:12:12] do you remember brother burnham speaking
[1:12:14] about the hornets
[1:12:17] the bull exactly
[1:12:20] he said when he was crossing a place he
[1:12:23] was going
[1:12:24] through he jumped a fence he went to a
[1:12:27] place
[1:12:27] where he was going to pray for a sick
[1:12:30] person
[1:12:31] and then as he jumped in that fence he
[1:12:33] forgot that there was a
[1:12:34] very very uh
[1:12:38] very very mean bull in that
[1:12:42] place and the bull was coming to kill
[1:12:45] him and barbara
[1:12:46] realized that he didn't have any gun
[1:12:50] so he say i'm going just to die like a
[1:12:53] man i
[1:12:54] won't be a coward so
[1:12:57] um but something happened
[1:13:00] to him you know
[1:13:04] understanding and look at the
[1:13:07] bull he understood the book
[1:13:11] he understood his anger i said i am in
[1:13:15] your
[1:13:15] turf this is your place
[1:13:19] i am an intruder it's my fault
[1:13:22] he understood the anger as we can
[1:13:26] understand some behavior of our brothers
[1:13:29] without doing what they're doing without
[1:13:32] doing what my sister is doing
[1:13:34] if it's contrary to the word of god but
[1:13:37] i can
[1:13:38] understand why they're doing it
[1:13:41] say i i came in your territory you have
[1:13:44] the right to defend it
[1:13:47] it's my fault but i'm going to i'm going
[1:13:49] to pray for some
[1:13:51] buddy who's sick so
[1:13:55] let me go go sit down
[1:13:58] but say that something took him
[1:14:03] amen we are called to get to that
[1:14:07] to that agape love that's where we are
[1:14:10] called to
[1:14:13] amen god help us the hornet was the same
[1:14:16] thing
[1:14:17] i came to disturb you i understand why
[1:14:20] you you need you
[1:14:21] have to attack me i understand i
[1:14:24] understand why
[1:14:25] this brother the sister is acting this
[1:14:27] way maybe something
[1:14:29] in the family something
[1:14:32] in in how she grew up and
[1:14:36] something happened and and sometimes
[1:14:40] misunderstanding of what the church
[1:14:43] actually is you know which sometimes we
[1:14:46] misunderstand let me just say it
[1:14:49] sometimes
[1:14:50] we misunderstand because there is a
[1:14:52] social component
[1:14:54] to the church all the things are very
[1:14:57] critical
[1:14:59] but once we take our eyes off
[1:15:03] what is important then we go with the
[1:15:06] social
[1:15:07] this person did not greet me i came to
[1:15:11] greet and they turned
[1:15:13] i won't go to the church anymore the
[1:15:16] only thing we
[1:15:17] lose our eyes on the balls
[1:15:23] and this is when before i would look
[1:15:26] maybe i would look at that person and
[1:15:28] say oh there's still babies
[1:15:31] but now the word is telling us that's
[1:15:34] the wrong attitude
[1:15:35] too we are in this together
[1:15:39] so if they don't grow i'm not growing or
[1:15:42] they don't grow i'm not going
[1:15:44] it's us is our body therefore now my
[1:15:48] attitude must change
[1:15:50] [Applause]
[1:15:51] absolutely now i don't see it
[1:15:55] it's not a selfishness it's not like
[1:15:59] them against us we holy
[1:16:02] they are now how he looks like we are
[1:16:06] all in it all of us
[1:16:10] it's not me and my family we all have to
[1:16:14] go
[1:16:15] no one left behind he changed our
[1:16:18] attitude
[1:16:19] and god is not into the think of that
[1:16:22] we do like them and us
[1:16:25] holy and no god it is not
[1:16:29] in that
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:32] do i still have time
[1:16:36] but i'm saying you don't have room for
[1:16:39] me to preach
[1:16:40] and i say to you you don't have time for
[1:16:42] me to preach
[1:16:53] the elected listen to the public message
[1:16:57] and look for the private one
[1:17:02] that's what changes you i remember
[1:17:06] friend of mine yeah
[1:17:09] his wife was not converted and she kept
[1:17:12] telling him
[1:17:14] do not ever ask me to be baptized
[1:17:17] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:17:19] don't do that
[1:17:20] and she was a very nice person but when
[1:17:23] it came to that
[1:17:24] she was really um
[1:17:30] and uh brother said no we don't do that
[1:17:35] so one day she came to church a simple
[1:17:38] message was preached
[1:17:41] she said she told us later i want that
[1:17:45] preacher to stop preaching
[1:17:48] i want to stop it i'm going to the to be
[1:17:51] baptized now
[1:17:53] stop preaching
[1:17:56] that's when we go two hours or more
[1:18:01] she went and was baptized why
[1:18:04] she heard the silent spot
[1:18:08] all the thing that was happening never
[1:18:10] reach her
[1:18:11] we need when we come to church to get
[1:18:13] that part
[1:18:15] it's very important it's indispensable
[1:18:20] amen amen
[1:18:28] now i i warn you that i'm going to go
[1:18:34] out on a limb
[1:18:38] uh do you like that
[1:18:43] can i feel at home
[1:18:46] all right
[1:18:49] if you you remember brother brenham
[1:18:58] in 1955
[1:19:01] when he saw the
[1:19:05] division a tent
[1:19:08] or some construction that looked like a
[1:19:11] cathedral i guess it was
[1:19:13] a dome that impacted his life
[1:19:17] so much and keep he didn't understand
[1:19:21] what was it and later on
[1:19:22] god is keep telling him
[1:19:26] that it was his third pull and he
[1:19:29] preached about it and always when he
[1:19:32] preached about it
[1:19:33] if i i if i can remember
[1:19:37] you always compare it to the tabernacle
[1:19:40] in the wilderness
[1:19:42] now so
[1:19:45] i was looking at those structure then i
[1:19:47] came across
[1:19:48] something here you see when you go on
[1:19:52] the internet
[1:19:52] you try to find what the tabernacle was
[1:19:57] they draw it kind of like that
[1:20:01] a rectangular
[1:20:04] and things like that then i came to
[1:20:06] something that
[1:20:07] maybe you can just look it's just
[1:20:09] interesting
[1:20:11] okay and you see
[1:20:14] this is an article that i pull on
[1:20:18] the internet is indifferent to newspaper
[1:20:23] but recently a man called andrew
[1:20:26] hai a mechanic engineer from milwaukee
[1:20:29] milwaukee
[1:20:30] wisconsin has challenged this
[1:20:33] traditional notion of what the
[1:20:34] tabernacle looked like
[1:20:36] by suggesting it was instead a large
[1:20:40] tent nearly sixth
[1:20:44] story high you say it's not
[1:20:48] really rectangular it's like a cathedral
[1:20:53] it's like a tent according to the
[1:20:55] breaking news
[1:20:56] uh israel breaking news hoy journey
[1:21:00] started when he left the lithuarian
[1:21:03] church he was attending in
[1:21:05] america to study hebrew at a
[1:21:08] jewish seminary in israel hoy
[1:21:12] then use a computer program to create a
[1:21:15] tent and defense
[1:21:17] and defense that matisse meticulously
[1:21:21] met both the biblical quantities and the
[1:21:23] description while
[1:21:25] at the same time follow the engineering
[1:21:28] principles
[1:21:30] this new topic ended up
[1:21:33] being six stories
[1:21:36] high a much more imposing structure than
[1:21:41] traditionally envisioned
[1:21:45] as israel camped around the large tent
[1:21:48] it would be
[1:21:49] visible to nearly everyone no matter how
[1:21:52] far back they were
[1:21:55] so he said not this but it was so
[1:21:58] strange brother branham speaking about
[1:22:00] the tenth vision he said it's like a
[1:22:02] cathedral
[1:22:03] was he looking at the dome something
[1:22:07] really big and this man
[1:22:10] goes and starts studying hebrews and
[1:22:14] look at the measurement
[1:22:15] even he says in the bible pie
[1:22:19] you know pie oh children
[1:22:23] pie three three point
[1:22:26] fourteen help me here
[1:22:29] all right insist those he put the
[1:22:32] measurement together
[1:22:34] and uh this is what he came up with
[1:22:42] it came up
[1:22:45] with a tent round in shape
[1:22:48] of a cathedral
[1:22:53] and this is what barbara speaks about i
[1:22:55] was like in a
[1:22:57] big structure big children
[1:23:01] and according to hoy um similar to
[1:23:06] mongolian herd he heard
[1:23:10] the tabernacles a rounded ship
[1:23:13] would stand up to the wind better than a
[1:23:16] rectangular construction
[1:23:18] hoy's perception of the the tabernacle
[1:23:21] is unique and will
[1:23:22] certainly challenge many long held
[1:23:25] perceptions of what it actually looked
[1:23:28] like
[1:23:30] it was just so strange interesting
[1:23:35] how come the prophet always talked about
[1:23:38] its
[1:23:39] tent like a cathedral and yet
[1:23:42] in our mind when we look at the
[1:23:45] tabernacle where the holiest of
[1:23:48] all is where it looks like it's
[1:23:52] square everywhere you look on the
[1:23:54] internet you will find that structure
[1:23:57] except when i look at this man
[1:24:00] and this this hoy say that it looks
[1:24:04] like a mongolian earth
[1:24:08] i don't know if you say you're too young
[1:24:11] i don't know
[1:24:13] and this is what is the mongolian yacht
[1:24:18] and brother burnham say i was under a
[1:24:20] bed
[1:24:21] it looks like a cathedral a tent
[1:24:26] and he he what he say and
[1:24:29] just then he picked me up it took me up
[1:24:32] and set me up
[1:24:34] high to where a meeting was going on
[1:24:38] looked like a tent or cathedral of some
[1:24:40] sort
[1:24:41] and i looked and there was a little box
[1:24:44] like
[1:24:45] a little place over in
[1:24:48] in this in the side
[1:24:52] this doesn't change change anything but
[1:24:55] just
[1:24:56] interesting we always
[1:24:59] knew that he is going to be square but
[1:25:02] he looks like this uh this man find
[1:25:05] a structure that looks like brother
[1:25:08] branham vision
[1:25:10] i want to talk just about that because
[1:25:15] what is happening in that tent
[1:25:19] is critical what is happening is
[1:25:23] in the tent there is a little box
[1:25:27] a little place on in the side
[1:25:32] and i seen that light that was taking
[1:25:35] to talking to somebody above me
[1:25:39] the light that you see there on the
[1:25:41] picture
[1:25:42] it wheeled away from me like that
[1:25:45] and went over that tent and say
[1:25:48] i will meet you there
[1:25:52] the light for the first time leaves
[1:25:56] the angel and
[1:25:59] goes into that structure
[1:26:02] and say i will meet you there i said
[1:26:06] this will be the third pool
[1:26:08] you won't tell it to nobody and in
[1:26:11] saving your canyon he said this is the
[1:26:13] third pole
[1:26:16] i like always to refer to this
[1:26:20] message because there is a
[1:26:23] silence somewhere there there is a small
[1:26:27] structure in that big structure that
[1:26:30] every one must get
[1:26:34] in
[1:26:37] every christian everyone under the
[1:26:40] cathedral
[1:26:41] of the message must get in
[1:26:45] everyone who claimed to be message
[1:26:48] believer
[1:26:49] under this big umbrella of message
[1:26:52] believer
[1:26:53] has to get in and you only get there
[1:26:58] one person at a time
[1:27:02] and when you go there there is no
[1:27:05] symbol there is nothing that you can
[1:27:09] bring out there
[1:27:11] is a connection from your soul to god
[1:27:14] himself amen is the silence that
[1:27:18] we all need especially in this time
[1:27:22] where we have to go back to our land
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:32] listen what he's saying
[1:27:35] and a real problem continues in what is
[1:27:38] a vision
[1:27:40] 1956 and a real kind gentleman walked
[1:27:44] out to the platform and say while
[1:27:48] brother branham is resting just a few
[1:27:52] moments
[1:27:52] he said we will call the prayer line and
[1:27:55] say everyone with a
[1:27:57] prayer prayer cards begin with a certain
[1:28:00] number
[1:28:01] stand over and on to the right well i
[1:28:03] know this is the prayer line
[1:28:05] seems like it went all around the tent
[1:28:08] and out and down the street such a
[1:28:11] prayer line
[1:28:14] everyone what is it a mega
[1:28:17] church a multi-mega
[1:28:23] church will it ever exist
[1:28:27] or it is a symbol of everyone that
[1:28:30] believes the message
[1:28:34] that while brother branham got into
[1:28:37] his silence we
[1:28:40] now all of us without
[1:28:44] exception get into that
[1:28:47] structure where the
[1:28:51] anointing went to and
[1:28:54] be there face to face with god a
[1:28:58] personal revelation with god
[1:29:02] it's that time or not
[1:29:06] while by the banana is resting because
[1:29:08] when brother bernam was
[1:29:10] alive you and i could not read the
[1:29:13] message
[1:29:15] it was the message we will all
[1:29:18] have gone to jeffersonville
[1:29:22] the real estate market in jeffersonville
[1:29:25] will be booming
[1:29:27] because our i am the first guilty i'll
[1:29:29] be there
[1:29:30] i will have gone there buy a house next
[1:29:33] to by the wood
[1:29:37] and every day sending my prayer request
[1:29:41] where are my keys i didn't see my key
[1:29:43] today
[1:29:46] that's what we will do we will never
[1:29:48] read the message
[1:29:49] i i used to tell people i say we
[1:29:52] actually killed brother branham
[1:29:54] because if he was alive we will never
[1:29:57] read the message that's how god has to
[1:30:00] take him he was very young now that i'm
[1:30:03] looking at it
[1:30:04] i can see brother brennan was really
[1:30:07] young
[1:30:11] but the chad doesn't see it yet but he
[1:30:13] was
[1:30:14] really young
[1:30:18] but it has to go once it goes
[1:30:23] there is a time where we have to become
[1:30:26] serious about what we heard
[1:30:30] and not just the this what is it
[1:30:34] the letter but we we
[1:30:38] have to really stop
[1:30:41] and go inside that structure
[1:30:46] otherwise we have been wasting
[1:30:49] our time
[1:30:52] the line is very long it goes outside
[1:30:58] i look at it i say people that are still
[1:31:02] coming to the message they're outside
[1:31:06] the line the line is outside
[1:31:09] they get inside people that are in the
[1:31:11] message
[1:31:13] we need to stop the system and
[1:31:16] stationarity
[1:31:19] we have to individually
[1:31:22] there is no exception about it
[1:31:26] this is serious business my brothers and
[1:31:29] sisters
[1:31:31] everyone has to go into that
[1:31:34] little building
[1:31:37] you come out you can't explain
[1:31:40] we have to get to the point where we
[1:31:42] don't explain the message
[1:31:45] otherwise somebody will convince you
[1:31:48] otherwise
[1:31:50] why do you believe i believe because god
[1:31:52] told me it's true
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:55] amen how god speaks to you speaks to you
[1:31:58] through your
[1:31:59] soul the
[1:32:02] first the first sign was
[1:32:05] in his hand there was a summer
[1:32:08] the first sign was in the end
[1:32:12] you could feel taste
[1:32:18] all right you could touch field test
[1:32:21] touch whatever
[1:32:22] five senses the second sign was the mind
[1:32:26] he said i am going to i i am
[1:32:29] catching your spirit it was the spirit
[1:32:33] the
[1:32:34] second sign but the third
[1:32:37] is not even a sign yeah we can say is a
[1:32:40] sign of his judgment
[1:32:41] but the third is not
[1:32:44] just a sign is himself
[1:32:48] the third pull is himself
[1:32:51] you gotta go meet himself otherwise
[1:32:55] we are losing we are wasting our time
[1:32:58] you go inside the angel is not even
[1:33:02] there in that place the angel
[1:33:05] sent from the lord is not there the
[1:33:08] pillar of fire
[1:33:09] is with you alone personal
[1:33:13] private oh private
[1:33:16] message meaning god speaking to you
[1:33:20] privately it's
[1:33:23] very critical
[1:33:29] my mind
[1:33:34] i told you already you don't have time
[1:33:37] for me to preach
[1:33:42] that doesn't mean i don't appreciate but
[1:33:44] i
[1:33:46] appreciate him giving me
[1:33:49] god put in his heart that maybe i have
[1:33:52] something
[1:33:53] that can help someone maybe someone
[1:33:57] standing on the sidelines
[1:34:00] you know all right let's just
[1:34:04] share those oh for another few minutes
[1:34:08] you see i've seen things
[1:34:11] i share with my family this more than
[1:34:14] once
[1:34:15] the level of the anointing that is
[1:34:18] happening in these days
[1:34:23] it's so high that if we don't pay
[1:34:26] attention
[1:34:27] the rotting will be terrible
[1:34:31] so i remember
[1:34:36] one day it was actually
[1:34:40] february saturday february the 15th
[1:34:45] i had a dream where
[1:34:48] i see myself as a soldier it looks like
[1:34:52] i'm like a soldier so it means that i
[1:34:55] must have
[1:34:56] uniform and i'm a soldier you know
[1:35:00] uh and then
[1:35:04] and then i see like i spot the enemy
[1:35:08] maybe in front i spot the enemy here
[1:35:11] and it looks like i'm kind of telling
[1:35:14] the group with me let's go back let's go
[1:35:17] back because we
[1:35:17] spot the enemy and we go and i'm
[1:35:21] i'm a sodium yeah
[1:35:24] and then it looks like we go into a some
[1:35:26] sort of a break
[1:35:29] maybe in our trenches and and then
[1:35:33] i i'm talking to somebody i don't know
[1:35:36] who i'm talking to but i just remembered
[1:35:39] i was talking to somebody
[1:35:41] and i say to the person i say i have
[1:35:44] one regret being a soldier
[1:35:48] i never received the formal training
[1:35:52] that's my regret all
[1:35:56] this i never thought about it during the
[1:35:58] day
[1:35:59] it's not like i ate a big meal
[1:36:03] or spicy meal but it
[1:36:06] just happened that way so here is a
[1:36:09] february 15
[1:36:11] sunday 16 i get to church
[1:36:15] and whatever where the chad was the one
[1:36:18] preaching
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:20] he came and he said uh
[1:36:24] let's read second timothy
[1:36:27] two uh second timothy chapter two
[1:36:30] three to four he say uh thou
[1:36:34] therefore undue hardness as
[1:36:38] a good soldier of jesus christ
[1:36:42] no man that whereif entangleth
[1:36:46] himself with the affairs of this life
[1:36:49] that he may please him who had chosen
[1:36:53] him to be soldier
[1:36:56] what i thought if we go to
[1:36:59] jeffersonville
[1:37:00] then we will see brother branham then he
[1:37:03] will give us interpretation of dreams
[1:37:06] then he will do the discernment but the
[1:37:08] discernment is here
[1:37:11] the world that we hear has a discernment
[1:37:15] power
[1:37:16] and is so powerful
[1:37:21] then the title of the message was an
[1:37:24] army
[1:37:25] prepared and when a child was
[1:37:28] preaching and saying that we need to be
[1:37:32] trained well the answer to my
[1:37:35] dream we need to be trained
[1:37:39] because we have we will have greater
[1:37:43] responsibilities you still
[1:37:46] you remember the message he said you
[1:37:49] cannot take a kid and
[1:37:50] give them a big responsibility with
[1:37:54] a big weapon they have to be
[1:37:57] trained and explain about the
[1:38:00] training the uh the preparation
[1:38:04] i want to forget that it was a
[1:38:07] preparation
[1:38:09] training because with a great
[1:38:12] uh blessing comes a bless great
[1:38:16] responsibilities
[1:38:19] god is just answer me you know sometimes
[1:38:22] you can go to a place
[1:38:24] we have seen it happening many times
[1:38:27] where
[1:38:27] out of the blue the preacher points
[1:38:30] something that you did
[1:38:32] but i'm telling you as a preacher after
[1:38:36] being in this journey for very long time
[1:38:40] what we sing now is
[1:38:43] higher because
[1:38:47] what happened is i could just forget the
[1:38:51] supernatural side
[1:38:54] of all that i saw and
[1:38:57] just stick with what was being preached
[1:39:00] it answered everything it's not just
[1:39:03] something out of the blue but it's
[1:39:06] that the word is being explained to you
[1:39:11] from the beginning to the end i don't
[1:39:13] know how to say this
[1:39:17] is another layer another level
[1:39:25] amen and that's what we we want
[1:39:28] then
[1:39:32] then it it's not the word from
[1:39:35] a man that is
[1:39:38] my word then i
[1:39:41] am the message
[1:39:46] and that day but it was saying that we
[1:39:48] need teaching we need
[1:39:50] training preparation we have a greater
[1:39:53] responsibility
[1:39:54] hey i'm getting the interpretation of my
[1:39:57] dream
[1:39:58] right there on the pulpit
[1:40:02] the thing i'm trying to show you is
[1:40:05] i could not have seen that dream
[1:40:09] but yet i can just go with the word i
[1:40:12] was preached
[1:40:14] that's another level
[1:40:19] god help me to say this this is when i
[1:40:22] want to be a preacher
[1:40:25] oh my god
[1:40:31] every scripture has
[1:40:34] a public portion
[1:40:39] and a private one
[1:40:42] he has a a uh a spoken
[1:40:46] portion and a silent one
[1:40:50] and i want to be able to get into the
[1:40:53] silent one
[1:40:55] not for knowledge sake
[1:40:58] but to get to to get somewhere with
[1:41:02] god to get somewhere with god
[1:41:06] i need that portion
[1:41:12] first timothy i don't know if i'm going
[1:41:14] to finish this one
[1:41:26] ah maybe i wouldn't
[1:41:29] finish with this one
[1:41:34] first timothy chapter three
[1:41:38] this is a true saying if a man
[1:41:42] desired the office of bishop he desires
[1:41:46] a good work and this is the conditions
[1:41:51] well um
[1:41:56] this this this is strange to me
[1:41:59] okay let me go back if a man desire the
[1:42:03] office of bishop he desire good work
[1:42:06] is it possible
[1:42:11] is it possible for a man to wake up one
[1:42:14] morning and say
[1:42:16] i desire to be a bishop
[1:42:23] so i'm not reading it right
[1:42:26] all right this is what i'm talking about
[1:42:30] there must be a silent part to this
[1:42:34] because nobody can just come and say
[1:42:38] ah i feel like being a bishop
[1:42:46] well yeah no no no
[1:42:50] a man cannot just go and say i want to
[1:42:54] be a bishop
[1:42:56] something must happen but that part
[1:43:00] is not being said
[1:43:03] that part is a silent because a man
[1:43:07] has to be called it's all right
[1:43:11] it has to be called and sometimes god
[1:43:15] must have twisted his arm very for very
[1:43:18] long time
[1:43:19] because it turned out that when you ca
[1:43:23] when god calls you to the ministry
[1:43:26] you have a tendency of running away
[1:43:30] and therefore if you say that a man
[1:43:34] desire an office he has done
[1:43:37] a good thing i don't understand that
[1:43:39] there must
[1:43:40] be something that
[1:43:43] is not being said and that's why
[1:43:48] it says that a man
[1:43:52] uh because if i had written it
[1:43:55] i would say that a man who
[1:43:59] desired to be a bishop is actually a
[1:44:02] novice
[1:44:05] because it's uh unless
[1:44:08] this person has been called
[1:44:11] unless this person has been called
[1:44:15] unless god twisted his arm
[1:44:19] then he realized that that's what i need
[1:44:22] to do
[1:44:23] then if they're looking for a a bishop
[1:44:26] somewhere that person can say
[1:44:28] i gotta do it because that's my calling
[1:44:32] but the person cannot just walk up one
[1:44:35] morning and say
[1:44:36] oh i i it's fun to be
[1:44:41] a bishop i want to be one
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:47] that i can keep going and
[1:44:50] and on and on and on
[1:44:54] but uh it is uh
[1:45:01] there must be something hidden behind it
[1:45:05] because this job is is not an easy one
[1:45:10] and everyone needs to be praying for
[1:45:13] this
[1:45:13] office god help us
[1:45:17] it is a is is hard
[1:45:20] i remember one time i held that
[1:45:24] uh office long time ago
[1:45:28] is good when you you're old you can talk
[1:45:30] about the law
[1:45:31] all the stories
[1:45:34] and maybe nobody will know what i'm
[1:45:36] talking about
[1:45:38] i remember one time having a new
[1:45:42] church and there is
[1:45:46] a our first wedding
[1:45:49] as is taking place and
[1:45:55] and suddenly something starts happening
[1:46:00] and we hear that the sister
[1:46:04] who's want to get married actually the
[1:46:07] sister has been
[1:46:09] living not the right life
[1:46:12] that's not our problem they want to get
[1:46:14] married
[1:46:16] is their problem well
[1:46:20] it turned out the sister was actually
[1:46:23] really into the world and she's sick
[1:46:27] she had aids and the pastor
[1:46:32] he comes to me and actually god
[1:46:35] tells me that i'm going to stop
[1:46:38] the joy of the fiancee
[1:46:43] of these two people instead of the joy
[1:46:46] of getting married
[1:46:49] you know they're going to be mourning
[1:46:53] here i am i am a new
[1:46:56] minister my pastor is
[1:47:00] far away there is no good communication
[1:47:04] what am i going to do
[1:47:08] if this brother marries this girl
[1:47:11] chances are he's going to die
[1:47:16] how are to do there's nobody there is
[1:47:18] nobody
[1:47:20] and i never been trained by the way
[1:47:23] to be a pastor what to do
[1:47:27] and remember a girl can be
[1:47:30] six years or eight years old she already
[1:47:33] dreamed about when she'll be in a white
[1:47:35] dress
[1:47:37] and i am the one called to ruin that
[1:47:42] and what to do just close my eyes and
[1:47:44] say i didn't hear
[1:47:48] anything
[1:47:50] but i have to do something and i
[1:47:53] i go and i uh
[1:47:56] i say okay i you know wedding is a big
[1:48:00] thing
[1:48:02] family involved friends other churches
[1:48:07] it's a big one and
[1:48:10] why do you stop the wedding
[1:48:13] ah we stopped the wedding because our
[1:48:15] pastor what pastor you you the
[1:48:17] brennamite
[1:48:19] what happened to him he he think he's
[1:48:21] god
[1:48:23] he's going to stop that and i have
[1:48:25] nobody i don't even have a minister to
[1:48:27] help me
[1:48:28] and i can share with that minister
[1:48:31] the issue i'm far away i'm alone
[1:48:37] scriptures must have a silent
[1:48:40] portion of it
[1:48:47] and here is god is telling me there will
[1:48:51] be
[1:48:51] no joy there would be no feasts
[1:48:55] there will be mourning
[1:48:58] and it turns out that
[1:49:01] the day once i
[1:49:05] say i'm going to stop this marriage
[1:49:09] the church went into turmoil
[1:49:12] people came out
[1:49:16] and they say badaka is
[1:49:20] using rumors and the church
[1:49:23] split and
[1:49:28] and the day of wedding came
[1:49:31] and i stood on the pulpit
[1:49:35] and i started crying i just whipping
[1:49:38] oh crying like a baby the very next day
[1:49:45] the brother came to me called me the
[1:49:48] brother who left the church
[1:49:50] who has who left the church who has
[1:49:54] um who want to get married
[1:49:59] he calls me and he says nothing
[1:50:03] and i knew that he got the sickness
[1:50:09] i knew he's going to die
[1:50:17] i cry to the lord i cry to the lord
[1:50:20] asking him god forgive this brother
[1:50:24] but he never worked then i said to the
[1:50:27] lord
[1:50:28] if you want to take this brother
[1:50:31] i don't want to be there
[1:50:36] and god agrees he moved me from that
[1:50:39] country
[1:50:40] so i won't see the brother die
[1:50:43] what a responsibility
[1:50:52] so
[1:50:57] but if this brother and this sister
[1:51:01] had heard the voice not from the past
[1:51:04] stopping the wedding if they had
[1:51:08] heard from god himself if the brother
[1:51:12] had
[1:51:12] gone to his knees and say my pastor is a
[1:51:16] man
[1:51:17] it has a flows that's what god
[1:51:20] uses man he could use a moon
[1:51:24] star but he has to use a man
[1:51:27] to show that he can bring redemption
[1:51:31] through men despite their flaws
[1:51:34] if they had gone on their knees and
[1:51:38] pray and say god you send me this
[1:51:41] man to help me i will send
[1:51:44] you elijah the prophet who
[1:51:48] is the most important is you
[1:51:51] if they had done it these things will
[1:51:54] not have happened
[1:51:56] and everybody that people that left the
[1:51:59] church
[1:52:00] because all the pastors say this it does
[1:52:03] this
[1:52:03] and it does this they win and they were
[1:52:07] plagued
[1:52:08] of the flag of the plagues
[1:52:13] we don't want to talk about this type of
[1:52:16] things but i was thinking about
[1:52:18] that scripture i say every scripture
[1:52:21] that we see
[1:52:22] has a hidden part an unspoken one
[1:52:26] how can this be that this is true saying
[1:52:30] if a man desire the office of a bishop
[1:52:34] he desires a good work is that true
[1:52:38] no it takes god to take that man and
[1:52:41] twist his arm
[1:52:42] i remember coming to the united states
[1:52:45] and i'm just you know oh
[1:52:49] how my children will live here and
[1:52:52] god is telling me preach the gospel
[1:52:56] what preach the gospel i don't speak the
[1:52:59] language
[1:53:01] i don't have the culture how can i speak
[1:53:06] preach the gospel and he was using words
[1:53:09] like
[1:53:10] abraham lincoln he was a man
[1:53:14] standing on the principles
[1:53:17] he was not afraid
[1:53:20] he made the right decision and that's
[1:53:23] how god was talking to me
[1:53:26] and i i actually twisted my arm
[1:53:30] then i started designing the office of a
[1:53:33] bishop
[1:53:38] then he put me there um who how
[1:53:42] are you going to start the the church
[1:53:45] well your family is the first church
[1:53:49] my children the youngest was like a two
[1:53:51] years old
[1:53:52] the oldest was like about seven
[1:53:56] okay we're gonna start the service the
[1:53:58] children came with anticipation
[1:54:01] they loved it so we sit with
[1:54:04] i started preaching to them my wife said
[1:54:08] i thought you were preaching to children
[1:54:10] how they edify me too
[1:54:15] you see and
[1:54:19] a sister an american sister heard
[1:54:22] us we have a service and she came
[1:54:26] she came and sit down
[1:54:30] and start listening to the world the
[1:54:33] next day
[1:54:35] she said i i brought my ties
[1:54:39] so what
[1:54:44] then another sister came and then
[1:54:46] another one heard
[1:54:48] that that was a minister in
[1:54:49] jeffersonville
[1:54:51] and he also and she also came
[1:54:55] and that's how the service started i
[1:54:58] just
[1:54:59] i took this i took a long turn
[1:55:02] here but my point is the same
[1:55:06] a spoken portion of the word
[1:55:10] but there is another one that
[1:55:14] is a silent one
[1:55:19] it's very important as
[1:55:22] the world is crumbling that
[1:55:25] everything is failing now we
[1:55:29] go back we go back
[1:55:32] each and everyone and
[1:55:38] and return really to the portion to the
[1:55:41] place that god has called us to be
[1:55:45] the book of acts brother branham say is
[1:55:47] a book that
[1:55:48] never been closed is that right
[1:55:52] i want when my journey is finished
[1:55:57] when everything is done and when this
[1:55:59] book
[1:56:00] is continued to be written i don't want
[1:56:03] to be a hinder
[1:56:04] in any way for the move
[1:56:07] of the holy ghost
[1:56:11] it's very easy to do that
[1:56:15] because we are human being you know we
[1:56:18] look at
[1:56:18] each other as a human being but the
[1:56:21] christ
[1:56:22] that is in my brother and my sister is
[1:56:25] greater than me
[1:56:28] it's time we started looking at this
[1:56:31] this uh these things not
[1:56:34] just a letters but to get into
[1:56:38] a privacy with the lord
[1:56:41] everyone that claimed to be a message
[1:56:45] believer
[1:56:46] that's the call and the angel
[1:56:50] of death is outside i'm not using it to
[1:56:52] scare people off but the
[1:56:56] angel is there all these signs are
[1:56:59] there actually god is showing so many
[1:57:02] things to people
[1:57:05] it's all over the place it's
[1:57:08] time for us to be more serious about it
[1:57:13] it's time for god to speak to us in a
[1:57:16] silence where
[1:57:17] people look they don't see but you
[1:57:20] see something yet is not written
[1:57:23] but is written do you want to get to
[1:57:27] that
[1:57:28] that's where we're going i'm trying just
[1:57:31] i
[1:57:32] tried to give you an example of the
[1:57:34] level of discernment
[1:57:36] i see it constantly i see god opening
[1:57:40] the world
[1:57:41] even in example i saw one day
[1:57:44] here i'm coming i am in the woods maybe
[1:57:48] i'm praying myself i'm praying i'm
[1:57:51] thinking about
[1:57:52] something i start thinking about the
[1:57:55] conversation between cain and abel
[1:57:59] i start thinking about this and i say it
[1:58:02] must have happened this way
[1:58:04] when i come to church it was almost
[1:58:07] word by word what i was thinking
[1:58:10] word by word that abel must have
[1:58:14] spoken to cain about the revelation
[1:58:18] it would almost word by word what was it
[1:58:22] the big things happened in the silence
[1:58:26] they happened in the secret
[1:58:29] greater things happened at that time
[1:58:32] amen god help us
[1:58:37] god help us by his grace and mercy
[1:58:41] god help us god bless you
[1:58:44] hey man musician can come
[1:58:50] whether ban is not true that the day of
[1:58:54] redemption
[1:58:55] is actually here
[1:59:04] the day of redemption
[1:59:21] be filled with
[1:59:37] [Applause]
[1:59:42] patience

[2:00:38] is
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:52] is
[2:01:06] is
[2:01:30] be filled with
[2:01:47] let's have our head
[2:01:52] you forgive me for taking so much time
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:01:58] sometime i didn't know how to go with
[2:02:01] this message
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:07] but by god grace i i pray that you
[2:02:11] understand the purpose
[2:02:15] i kind of went off and
[2:02:19] preached about
[2:02:21] [Music]
[2:02:24] the ministry what
[2:02:27] i went through but if you look
[2:02:31] closely you see scriptures
[2:02:36] have a portion that the elect
[2:02:41] need to catch is a silent part
[2:02:45] is not just knowledge
[2:02:49] but is a something that gives you
[2:02:53] conviction
[2:02:55] it's something that tells you that it's
[2:02:58] i
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:01] it's me who said william branham
[2:03:06] you're not in this church by luck
[2:03:10] [Music]
[2:03:11] this church is not
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:15] led by superhuman and your brothers
[2:03:19] sisters beside you are not superhuman
[2:03:21] they are human
[2:03:22] but christ in them is greater than you
[2:03:30] god starts showing you not just the
[2:03:33] letter
[2:03:34] but showing you the hidden message
[2:03:38] the hidden manner that he has
[2:03:41] predestined for you
[2:03:43] what that does it brings
[2:03:46] fear what is a fear
[2:03:50] reverence respect
[2:03:54] i start started respecting god more i
[2:03:57] respect his word
[2:03:58] more i have a reverence now
[2:04:02] not because someone said it
[2:04:06] a pastor said it that minister said it
[2:04:10] god spoke to me in private
[2:04:15] the public message
[2:04:17] [Music]
[2:04:18] god had added something to it
[2:04:22] a mystery god of
[2:04:26] abraham is the same today
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:31] will i hide from abraham
[2:04:35] what i have what is silent
[2:04:38] our time when abram heard the secret
[2:04:44] he start he start
[2:04:47] begging asking god
[2:04:50] [Music]
[2:04:51] interceding if we truly
[2:04:55] hear the message through
[2:04:58] the message in the silence portion
[2:05:02] we truly will intercede because he will
[2:05:06] not be the preacher who is telling us to
[2:05:08] do it
[2:05:09] but he will be god himself telling us
[2:05:13] we will do it in a selfishness way
[2:05:17] it will be because we are convinced
[2:05:20] that's why we are concerned it's time
[2:05:24] for the
[2:05:25] pride of christ in time for the message
[2:05:29] anyone under the umbrella of the message
[2:05:32] to come home to return to his own land
[2:05:36] the senses is taking place
[2:05:40] the death angel is outside
[2:05:43] i need to make sure i am right

[2:05:49] it is well with my soul
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:54] precious heavenly father i'm sorry i'm
[2:05:57] usually
[2:05:58] very careful with time
[2:06:01] what it happens let anything that was
[2:06:05] said maybe one word
[2:06:08] help somebody in churches they
[2:06:12] often people on the sidelines
[2:06:16] sometimes people
[2:06:19] are in certain condition father
[2:06:23] we're talking about people
[2:06:26] that will recognize you in this tough
[2:06:29] time
[2:06:30] but what about us the people from inside
[2:06:34] we need also to come home
[2:06:37] it's not just those who don't know you
[2:06:40] but we
[2:06:41] that know you for years it's
[2:06:44] time we pause and make sure that
[2:06:48] life is dramatizing
[2:06:52] it's time we look at our log and
[2:06:55] see that is not soft dirty
[2:06:58] rotten it's time we pause and say god i
[2:07:03] want to make sure
[2:07:05] the blood is applied
[2:07:12] god help us this message is
[2:07:15] called for more seriousness is it time
[2:07:19] to go to our needs and pray more it's
[2:07:21] true
[2:07:22] but it's a time where we gotta be
[2:07:24] serious that
[2:07:25] if the book of the act is
[2:07:29] continued to be written i don't want to
[2:07:31] be a hinderer
[2:07:33] in any way to the bride of christ
[2:07:38] i want to be a blessing to the bride of
[2:07:41] christ

[2:09:07] the desire of their hearts
[2:09:10] we pray this in the name of the lord
[2:09:13] jesus christ
[2:09:15] amen amen
[2:09:20] uh can we sing that time in that song
[2:09:23] in his time as a brother
[2:09:30] comes
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:10:13] in day town
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:30] [Music]
[2:10:36] in your time
[2:10:47] [Music]
[2:10:54] you
[2:11:05] praise the lord what a wonderful place
[2:11:09] to be in friends
[2:11:11] the security of a personal walk
[2:11:15] god is allowing all other foundations to
[2:11:18] be shaken
[2:11:20] and the everything that can be shaken
[2:11:24] will be shaken i don't believe this will
[2:11:27] be the only shaking or the last shaking
[2:11:30] but everything that can be shaken will
[2:11:32] be shaken
[2:11:34] only that which is not shaken shall
[2:11:35] remain
[2:11:37] we've got to be founded on the solid
[2:11:39] rock of jesus christ
[2:11:40] which is the revealed word in this hour
[2:11:43] and i praise god that there's a sure
[2:11:45] foundation
[2:11:47] that there's a place to run into there's
[2:11:48] a hiding place in this hour of trouble
[2:11:51] that brings a true sense of security
[2:11:54] because the security
[2:11:55] we're finding out is not coming from the
[2:11:57] government
[2:11:59] our security is not coming from the
[2:12:01] normal routine of life because that's
[2:12:03] changing
[2:12:03] our our security is not coming from our
[2:12:06] jobs our security is not coming from our
[2:12:07] income
[2:12:08] our security can only be found in a
[2:12:11] personal walk with jesus christ
[2:12:13] that i made contact with the eternal and
[2:12:15] something on the inside has awakened to
[2:12:17] life
[2:12:17] and i've made a connection with him
[2:12:20] outside of that there's no sure
[2:12:22] foundation
[2:12:24] and i love what he was saying about the
[2:12:26] third pool because in the third pool
[2:12:28] that line went outside from outside the
[2:12:30] message to end the message
[2:12:32] to end the little room you understand
[2:12:35] from outside we know the message is
[2:12:36] christ but i'm talking about
[2:12:38] as a form of preaching or as an
[2:12:39] understanding from outside
[2:12:41] to inside but that's not it yet that's
[2:12:44] not the destination coming to truth and
[2:12:46] an understanding of the basics of the
[2:12:48] truth and the restoring of the word
[2:12:49] but you've got to go to the word himself
[2:12:52] and the word himself is in the little
[2:12:53] room
[2:12:54] in the inner chamber just like you
[2:12:56] you've got the you've got the flesh and
[2:12:58] you've got the spirit but down in the
[2:13:00] soul
[2:13:00] is where christ abides and so
[2:13:04] we've come from outside of truth inside
[2:13:07] of truth
[2:13:07] but we have to unite with the person of
[2:13:09] truth
[2:13:11] and from then on it's a sure foundation
[2:13:13] for us
[2:13:14] we have to hear from him we have to
[2:13:16] catch the mystery
[2:13:18] for us because it's not just the
[2:13:22] mystery oh i think this is so important
[2:13:27] it's not just the mystery of what
[2:13:29] brother branham taught
[2:13:31] but it's the mystery of us we
[2:13:34] are that mystery we are a portion of
[2:13:37] that mystery
[2:13:38] and the mystery is me i'm a part of the
[2:13:42] mystery and that mystery inside has to
[2:13:44] be
[2:13:44] unlocked friends and then when the
[2:13:47] mystery is unlocked and
[2:13:48] to you it's no longer a mystery to you
[2:13:50] it's a secret because you went into the
[2:13:52] secret place
[2:13:53] and it turned from mystery to secret and
[2:13:55] now you realize what the mystery was all
[2:13:57] along
[2:13:58] it was the mystery was a bride and
[2:14:00] you're part of that
[2:14:02] oh i thank god for the word i was
[2:14:04] encouraged by the word today
[2:14:06] and i don't care how long he takes amen
[2:14:09] because with the way things are going
[2:14:10] now
[2:14:11] amen every service is a privilege and
[2:14:14] we're here to be here i don't think any
[2:14:15] of us are in a hurry anymore
[2:14:18] and then we're all just ready to feast
[2:14:19] praise god
[2:14:21] oh i just appreciated that and i loved
[2:14:23] his application of agapo love it was
[2:14:25] good
[2:14:27] i appreciate that so much amen god bless
[2:14:30] you let's pray for one another
[2:14:32] let's hold each other up amen we're
[2:14:34] coming to showdown this is the hour that
[2:14:36] god is going to show where his word is
[2:14:39] and no more denominationalism
[2:14:42] no more churchianity but it's showdown
[2:14:44] time and he wants to show where he's
[2:14:46] planted the seed and where it's at
[2:14:48] and it's time that it's got to bear
[2:14:50] fruit and it's going to be his life on
[2:14:51] display
[2:14:52] amen let's not run and hide from these
[2:14:54] things but let's face them head-on
[2:14:55] because god is bringing a show down on
[2:14:57] purpose intentionally
[2:14:59] because he wants to display his word
[2:15:02] amen
[2:15:03] god bless you all dawson if you'd like
[2:15:06] to make your way around back with mom
[2:15:07] and dad
[2:15:08] we're going to have a baptism here in a
[2:15:10] few minutes i just thank god
[2:15:13] amen this is encouraging in the hour of
[2:15:15] trouble this is encouraging to me
[2:15:18] that god is drawing to bring life forth
[2:15:21] praise god i also want to say god bless
[2:15:23] you brother nathanael
[2:15:24] it's good to see you in charity enjoyed
[2:15:26] that song how many appreciated that
[2:15:28] especially
[2:15:30] how many was that your heart's cry amen
[2:15:34] our brother was able to catch an
[2:15:36] inspiration and put it into words but
[2:15:38] what he put in the words was the desire
[2:15:39] of my heart
[2:15:41] amen god bless you let's sing a song um
[2:15:44] uh consume me lord can we sing that song
[2:15:48] how many would like to go into the inner
[2:15:49] chamber and just say consume me lord

[2:15:55] head pumped full of knowledge and
[2:15:57] and come out of theologian i don't want
[2:15:59] to go in there and come out
[2:16:00] proud and arrogant and better than
[2:16:02] everybody else but i want to go in there
[2:16:04] and i want to be consumed on that altar
[2:16:06] and i want to be completely destroyed
[2:16:08] and i want to come out different than
[2:16:09] what i came in and i wanted to be christ
[2:16:11] living through this body of flesh
[2:16:13] no longer the old life or the old
[2:16:15] desires of the old nature but i want the
[2:16:17] nature of jesus christ
[2:16:18] i want to go in there to die i don't
[2:16:20] want to go in there to learn something i
[2:16:22] don't want to go in there to have
[2:16:23] something to brag about but i want to go
[2:16:25] into that little chamber so that i can
[2:16:26] completely
[2:16:27] totally die be annihilated and come
[2:16:30] forth as a new creature in christ jesus
[2:16:33] we only go there to die so many people
[2:16:34] don't go into that room because they
[2:16:36] don't want to go in there to die
[2:16:37] they'll come into the tabernacle under
[2:16:39] the umbrella of the message because they
[2:16:41] like
[2:16:41] the experience they like the atmosphere
[2:16:43] they even like the truth amen but to go
[2:16:45] into the little room you've got to be
[2:16:47] willing to die
[2:16:49] and you've got the desire to die you
[2:16:51] have to want to be totally stripped down
[2:16:53] and remade into the image of jesus

[2:20:15] and he knows why he's doing it he's got
[2:20:17] the right desire the right pull in his
[2:20:19] heart
[2:20:20] and he's had this desire for a long time
[2:20:22] and mom and dad has watched him has
[2:20:23] become a desperate desire to be baptized
[2:20:26] to keep the word to be united with
[2:20:28] christ and
[2:20:29] publicly so people can see that what he

[2:21:05] may be the great shepherd and may you
[2:21:07] lead him all the way into the baptism of
[2:21:09] the holy ghost
[2:21:10] that he would have an experience with
[2:21:12] you lord that would quicken the seed to
[2:21:13] life and that
[2:21:14] he would have an assurance on the inside
[2:21:16] that he's met you that he's made
[2:21:17] contact with you lord and that you would
[2:21:19] use him as a bright and shining light in
