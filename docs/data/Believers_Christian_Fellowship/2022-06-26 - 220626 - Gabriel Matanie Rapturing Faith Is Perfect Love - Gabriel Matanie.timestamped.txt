[17:24] here ye him
[17:26] and
[17:27] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[17:29] their face and were sore afraid and
[17:33] jesus came and touched them and said
[17:35] arise
[17:36] and be not afraid
[17:39] amen
[17:40] and also i want to
[17:42] read from hebrew
[17:45] chapter 5
[17:48] hebrew chapter 5 from verse 7
[17:49] [Music]
[17:56] yes
[17:58] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[18:01] offered off prayers and supplication
[18:03] with strong crying and tears unto him
[18:06] that
[18:07] was able to save him from death
[18:10] and was heard in that he field
[18:13] through he were a son yet learned he
[18:16] obedience
[18:18] by the things which he suffered
[18:21] and being made perfect
[18:24] he became the author of eternal
[18:26] salvation
[18:27] unto all them
[18:29] that obey
[18:31] him hebrew chapter 2
[18:35] verse 10
[18:39] for it became him for whom are all
[18:42] things
[18:44] and by whom are all things
[18:47] in bringing many sons unto
[18:50] glory to make the captain of their
[18:52] salvation perfect
[18:55] truth sufferings
[18:57] for both he
[18:59] the sanctified
[19:01] and they who are sanctified
[19:04] are echad are one
[19:07] amen may the lord has a blessing for the
[19:10] reading of the world we can take our
[19:12] seats while i am going to stand
[19:17] amen i rely on the
[19:19] yeah
[19:21] so
[19:22] we want to
[19:23] share in this morning the thought
[19:26] that the lord placed in my heart
[19:28] rapturing faith
[19:30] perfect love
[19:33] rapturing faith
[19:35] perfect love
[19:37] amen this is election and revelation
[19:40] faith
[19:41] is revelation
[19:44] perfect revelation
[19:46] so we want to read
[19:48] at the beginning
[19:49] a quote
[19:51] from the
[19:52] midnight crime
[19:55] amen and the prophet said here
[19:58] you see he himself suffered
[20:02] he speaks about jesus he learned
[20:04] obedience by the sick now
[20:07] when we read about it here jesus already
[20:10] had the holy ghost baptism
[20:12] jesus was baptized with the holy ghost
[20:16] so he had to learn obedience
[20:19] by things he suffered
[20:23] he was actually made perfect
[20:27] not by the holy ghost baptism
[20:30] but by the things
[20:32] that he suffered
[20:34] hebrew 5 8 9 through he were a son
[20:39] he had learned he obedience
[20:42] we speak about jesus here
[20:44] he had to learn
[20:45] learn obedience he had to learn
[20:49] obedience
[20:51] my
[20:53] by the things
[20:54] which he suffered and being murdered
[20:57] made perfect
[20:59] he was made perfect
[21:02] he was not perfect when he get the holy
[21:04] ghost he became he was made perfect
[21:07] he became the author of eternal
[21:09] salvation unto all them that obey him in
[21:12] plain language the very
[21:15] character
[21:17] of jesus
[21:19] jesus
[21:22] needed
[21:23] a character
[21:30] was perfected
[21:31] he had a character
[21:34] that needed
[21:36] to be perfected
[21:40] and according to paul
[21:42] he has left his church
[21:45] a measure
[21:47] of suffering
[21:52] he was a
[21:56] striker
[21:58] she has to be two
[22:03] and according to paul he has left his
[22:05] church of messers that they too but
[22:07] their revelation in god
[22:10] but their faith in god
[22:12] while suffering for him
[22:15] will come to a place
[22:18] of perfection
[22:20] why did he want this
[22:22] my brethren counted all joy when he fall
[22:27] into diverse temptation knowing this
[22:29] that the trying of your revelation
[22:33] the triangle of your faith work with
[22:35] patience but let patience have her
[22:38] perfect work
[22:40] and he may be perfect
[22:42] and tired
[22:43] wanting
[22:45] nothing
[22:47] amen blessed be the name of the lord so
[22:49] we want to
[22:50] to dig a little bit
[22:52] if we want to don't
[22:55] be in tribulation
[22:56] you need to dig deeper
[23:00] this is what prophet said
[23:01] he's a quote amen we believe coach so
[23:04] after six days
[23:06] after six days that means
[23:09] pay attention
[23:13] it was the seven days
[23:15] in the in luke 9 28 i like number 28
[23:18] 28
[23:20] time of life
[23:23] when we can receive seed
[23:26] after 28 day verse 28 especially for us
[23:30] he said according
[23:32] about an eight days
[23:35] so after six days about and days
[23:39] this is like time blending with eternity
[23:44] and he lifted up his hand and swear of
[23:46] himself it will be no more time
[23:49] we are not busy with the flesh now
[23:51] there's no more time
[23:53] is eternity blending coming in
[23:56] it's something be in between two
[23:58] dimension is something between two words
[24:02] amen and
[24:04] the same the same the same thing we fi
[24:07] we find in mark
[24:08] nine he speaks about the same event
[24:13] when
[24:14] maybe i i will open in mark chapter 9
[24:18] can you follow me say amen
[24:20] hallelujah
[24:22] and i know i'm not preaching to me
[24:25] only
[24:27] verily i say unto you that there be some
[24:30] of them they stand here which shall not
[24:32] taste the death till you have been seen
[24:35] the kingdom of god
[24:39] he was speaking about this mount
[24:41] this event
[24:43] come with power
[24:45] this is the dynamics in in greek is
[24:48] dynamics so
[24:50] this this event was just read it is
[24:54] the the transfiguration
[24:58] its
[24:58] power
[25:00] what we have we need witnesses witnesses
[25:03] in this generation
[25:05] brought power
[25:07] has power in it
[25:10] the power of revelation
[25:13] amen and the brother brown said first
[25:15] quote now i do not know that these
[25:18] ministers behind me may be wondering
[25:20] because in time
[25:22] it was showing the second coming of
[25:25] christ so he was speaking about this
[25:27] event on the mount it was
[25:30] after six days about
[25:32] eight days
[25:34] in the seven
[25:35] churches
[25:37] it
[25:38] jesus went
[25:40] on the top of a mountain and he said
[25:43] it was a type
[25:45] it was a shadow
[25:47] a reality has to come it is here
[25:52] it was showing the second coming of
[25:55] christ that's the real way to approach
[25:58] it
[25:59] for it show it first jesus glorified
[26:02] second
[26:04] message to the jews first jesus
[26:08] glorified jesus is not anymore in his
[26:11] fleshly body he is in a glorified
[26:14] condition
[26:16] so
[26:17] second the message to the jews which
[26:19] will be the two prophets of revelation
[26:21] moses said elijah
[26:24] so we found him here going up to the
[26:28] mountain as we call it month of
[26:30] transfiguration i will i always like to
[26:33] look at it in the real sense
[26:38] is a real sense what happened then was a
[26:40] shadow
[26:41] but what we live today
[26:44] is the real sense
[26:47] that it is wrote in that and what all my
[26:49] ministering brothers approach it as a
[26:51] type of the second coming of christ and
[26:55] that is
[26:56] true
[26:58] that is true so we want to approach it
[27:01] in the real sense
[27:03] in the real sense jesus took his
[27:05] disciples
[27:07] on a great mountain mount aboard tabor
[27:10] tavor means clarifying explaining
[27:14] he took his disciple but said when you
[27:16] find the name in the bible you stop and
[27:18] look at what is what is about
[27:21] and jesus was
[27:22] transfigured metamorpho changes his form
[27:27] his face shine
[27:29] as the sun
[27:31] just like in revelation 10.
[27:34] hallelujah
[27:36] amen blessed be the name of
[27:38] the lord
[27:42] and
[27:43] when
[27:44] the real sense came revelation 10.
[27:48] the mighty angel came down
[27:52] amen
[27:55] revelation chapter 10
[27:59] when when the mighty angel
[28:01] came down it was the time when the
[28:03] seventh angel was on earth
[28:07] amen
[28:08] hallelujah
[28:10] and revelation chapter 10
[28:12] 7 says but in the days of the voice
[28:15] the voice is a person
[28:17] the same voice that walk in the garden
[28:19] of eden
[28:21] the same voice returned back
[28:24] a left half alpha an omega
[28:26] a person a voice that walk of the
[28:30] seventh angel
[28:32] so the voice is the person
[28:34] that's why we believe message is christ
[28:37] he is the person
[28:40] hallelujah
[28:42] the mystery of god god has a mystery
[28:46] god has a mystery
[28:50] you are his mystery
[28:52] as he declared so when he is about to
[28:56] sound when he is is the is the seventh
[28:59] this is the gospel trumpet this is a
[29:02] uh this is the message
[29:06] not the year of preparation
[29:08] but the message
[29:09] the message is revelation 10.
[29:12] the simple
[29:14] 10 vision
[29:15] seven thunders
[29:17] can you say praise the lord
[29:19] hallelujah
[29:20] amen
[29:24] so when
[29:25] this angel i saw mighty angel
[29:27] we have seen it too
[29:30] by the revelation
[29:32] came down from heaven
[29:35] he was closed with a cloud
[29:37] praise god we i already put in my bible
[29:40] 28 february 1963
[29:43] this is absolutely absolutely hallelujah
[29:48] brother brown said in quote number two
[29:50] but old elijah was the voice of god in
[29:53] that day
[29:54] he sure was the very type of the voice
[29:58] of god as the first coming of christ it
[30:00] will be the type of the voice in the
[30:03] same second coming of christ again
[30:06] according to the scriptures
[30:08] i am your brother by the grace of god
[30:11] but when the angel of the lord
[30:13] moves down it becomes then a voice of
[30:16] god to you
[30:18] oh if i offended you by saying that
[30:20] forgive me
[30:23] but i am god voice to you
[30:27] that was under inspiration
[30:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[30:32] so he came down
[30:35] and he when he came down he cried
[30:38] with a loud voice
[30:40] cry midnight cry
[30:43] it was matthew 25
[30:45] behold
[30:46] the bridegroom is here
[30:48] and my ministry is to declare there that
[30:52] he is here
[30:54] it is first destination thessalonians 4
[30:57] 16 the lord himself
[31:01] shall
[31:02] i can say head
[31:06] descended from heaven
[31:09] hallelujah
[31:12] now now you notice in the seventh seal
[31:14] he said on the opening of the seventh
[31:16] seal is a three-four mystery
[31:21] is the mystery of the seven thunders
[31:24] the seven thunders in heaven will unfold
[31:26] this mystery it will be right at the
[31:28] coming of christ because because christ
[31:31] said no one knew when he will return
[31:34] look where the voices was the thunders
[31:37] not in heaven on earth
[31:39] the thunders never
[31:41] uttered from heaven they uttered
[31:44] from the earth
[31:46] what was those standards
[31:48] the voices of the seven angels
[31:52] the seven ministers the seven spirits
[31:55] declaring his presence
[31:58] the ten vision
[32:02] genesis 18 everything happened in a tent
[32:06] sarah 10
[32:08] 10 vision
[32:10] because it was the uniting time
[32:14] as in the days of sodom the prophet said
[32:16] watch close in the days of sodom so will
[32:19] be the coming of the son of man when the
[32:21] son of man is being revealed
[32:24] no more as a church
[32:27] the bride is called
[32:29] in that day the son of man will be
[32:31] revealed
[32:32] to join the church and the head
[32:35] the marriage
[32:36] of the bride
[32:38] the bridegroom call
[32:41] will come right through this
[32:44] when the son of man will come down
[32:47] in the form of william branham
[32:49] in the form of a prophet
[32:52] but i can say it openly now
[32:54] because it's plainly
[32:57] it's not anymore something
[33:01] in human flesh
[33:03] and he did it
[33:05] to unite the two together
[33:07] the church has to be the world
[33:10] because he is the world
[33:12] and the two unites together
[33:15] it will take the manifestation
[33:18] the revealing of the son of man
[33:20] see
[33:22] it's son of man jesus christ
[33:26] will come down in human flesh
[33:29] among us
[33:30] and will make his words so real
[33:34] that he will unite the church
[33:36] and him as one the bride
[33:40] then she'll go home
[33:42] [Music]
[33:43] when she will know her position
[33:47] not when you know
[33:49] william branham position
[33:53] oh one day she will knew it
[33:56] then the rapture
[33:58] will go
[34:00] because the rapture is here
[34:03] now now it's coming the
[34:06] the dessert
[34:10] she's already united
[34:16] we go to the wedding supper
[34:19] not to the marriage
[34:22] [Music]
[34:27] feel your flesh
[34:31] he came down to feel my flesh
[34:35] he came down to feel your flesh
[34:38] the marriage is in the
[34:41] in you
[34:44] the circle is in your heart
[34:48] the world became flesh and the flesh
[34:50] became bigger became word
[34:54] all of the flesh of the mighty man cause
[34:56] the marriage of the lamb has come
[34:59] i can say
[35:00] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[35:04] let us be happy and rejoice
[35:07] we are at the marriage
[35:09] of the lord
[35:12] hallelujah
[35:14] this is my revival
[35:17] but the rapture
[35:19] is going to the wedding supper
[35:22] when the world here unites with the
[35:24] person and they too became one
[35:29] manifest the son of man again
[35:32] the son of man
[35:35] so the son of man is still continuing
[35:38] in your form
[35:41] the world and the church becomes one
[35:43] whatever the son of man done he was the
[35:46] world the child the church does the same
[35:50] thing
[35:52] can you say praise the lord
[35:54] so we are already united
[35:57] with who
[35:58] with the world
[36:00] the spoken word
[36:03] that's why
[36:04] i was i was
[36:06] very pleased when i saw brother
[36:08] hickerson testimony 90 years world he
[36:10] said they asked him brother hickerson
[36:13] what is the message for you
[36:15] i remember that old brother
[36:18] almost
[36:19] coming from the seed he said brother
[36:23] every fiber of my body
[36:28] i can say the same thing
[36:31] i am a prisoner of the message
[36:34] the message is controlling my life
[36:36] controlling my mind my decision my soul
[36:41] i could do nothing
[36:44] i am a prisoner of the message
[36:46] [Applause]
[36:49] that's why we are not only the bride but
[36:52] we are the wife
[36:55] because we received
[36:58] we had intimacy
[37:01] with the spoken word original sin
[37:06] we are pregnant
[37:08] by the message
[37:10] we are the wise virgins
[37:13] and we don't have oil to give
[37:18] i am not too good to share oil
[37:21] i filled my vessel with the anointed
[37:24] world
[37:28] and anything is running by oil
[37:31] and even the bride is running by oil
[37:35] which is the message
[37:37] which is the anointed world
[37:40] i somebody say i feel my vessel
[37:44] i filled my vessel
[37:46] with the message of the hour
[37:50] you cannot be so if you brother brown
[37:52] said if you are filled with the world
[37:55] you are
[37:56] with the spirit you are filled with the
[37:58] world
[38:01] don't show me how many demonstrations
[38:03] somebody can do
[38:05] show me how much message
[38:08] they have
[38:12] when they wash their teeth
[38:17] yes in in the secret chambers
[38:21] so it was the mystery
[38:23] of the returning of the pillar of fire
[38:28] the prophet said here in the west
[38:30] in he said
[38:33] quote number five
[38:35] he said they refused
[38:38] to be a part of other part of the world
[38:42] they want to abide in laodicea they want
[38:44] to still to be pentecostals
[38:48] good for them
[38:52] they refused
[38:54] to be a further part of that world
[39:02] they refuse
[39:03] to having spiritual or intimate
[39:07] relationship to become pregnant with the
[39:10] spoken word
[39:14] when the pillar of fire they turned it
[39:16] back
[39:17] but brown said speaking in sirs what
[39:20] time it is
[39:22] it is the science of the answer he said
[39:24] one of the mysteries
[39:26] is the returning of the pillar of fire
[39:30] that's the thing that's supposed to take
[39:33] place
[39:34] and we see it
[39:38] how
[39:39] we could go on naming the mysteries
[39:41] seeing that pillar of fire
[39:43] that led the children of israel
[39:46] the same one that struck down paul on
[39:48] his road to damascus and the same one
[39:51] coming with the same power
[39:54] this is the power of resurrection
[39:56] all the power was restored to the church
[39:59] revealing the same word
[40:04] blessed be the name
[40:06] of the lord
[40:09] the third exodus
[40:12] first exodus
[40:14] it was a rehearsal
[40:18] first exodus was
[40:19] nothing as
[40:21] you see the pentecost was not a
[40:23] christian
[40:24] feast
[40:25] it was a jewish feast
[40:27] they call it sukkot
[40:30] the first pentecost is is sorry is
[40:34] shaport
[40:36] shavuot
[40:37] means the feast of the weeks
[40:41] seven churches
[40:43] seven shabbat
[40:45] counting the omer
[40:48] every day
[40:49] every age people coming to maturity but
[40:52] in the 50s days
[40:54] which was the eighth day
[40:58] it was the wheat harvest
[41:01] when the wheat will come to maturity
[41:04] it was the feast the fulfillment of the
[41:07] first
[41:08] or the feast of the first fruits
[41:11] the first fruits started counting
[41:14] after the passover day the next day
[41:17] morning
[41:19] in the day of resurrection
[41:21] they the the first fruits the feast
[41:25] habicream in hebrew
[41:28] started to count
[41:34] and at the end of it
[41:36] they have to bring
[41:39] the fruits
[41:41] to the temple
[41:44] the two lambs
[41:46] and the two love breads
[41:49] from the jews and gentiles
[41:50] to be lifted up
[41:54] one lamb from the jews
[41:56] one lamp from the gentiles
[41:59] pentecost
[42:00] the first pentecost the first feast of
[42:03] shavuot was at the mount of sanay
[42:06] the mount of sanay

[42:10] marriage

[43:06] israel became a nation
[43:09] for 49 days they would eat barley
[43:13] but in the 50s days they would eat
[43:16] bread
[43:18] it was an elevation
[43:20] from the carnality to the spirit
[43:24] it was another dimension

[43:29] marriage has several steps seven
[43:31] seven stage stages and the last stage is

[44:29] eight
[44:30] they have to come in a closet in the
[44:32] room
[44:33] and they have to consume the marriage
[44:36] in silence
[44:38] about half an hour
[44:40] 28 minutes
[44:44] revelation 8 7 seal
[44:47] it is not a public show
[44:52] you don't want a numeric to be too many
[44:54] people around
[44:56] you want to be alone
[44:58] christ want to be alone
[45:01] it will not be a public show first
[45:04] pentecost the pillar of fire came down
[45:06] to unite himself with the people
[45:11] i want i will read you from the
[45:13] testimony of the rabbis
[45:16] the midrash speaks of the flames of fire
[45:18] which came down
[45:20] to each individual individual at sinai
[45:25] on the occasion of the giving of the
[45:27] torah
[45:28] the children of israel not only heard
[45:30] the lord's voice
[45:32] actually they saw the sounds wave
[45:36] as they emerged from the lord's mouth
[45:40] they could visualize them as a fiery
[45:43] substance
[45:44] each commandment that the lord
[45:47] left the lord mouse traveled around the
[45:49] entire entire camp and they came came
[45:52] back to every jew
[45:54] individually
[45:58] so that was the first
[45:59] exit the first
[46:01] marriage the first feast of pentecost we
[46:04] just have now the second pentecost of
[46:06] mount zion
[46:08] mount zion was on the upper what
[46:10] happened with israel
[46:13] they failed
[46:15] they lost their first love
[46:18] they could not continue
[46:20] battleground said the second exodus the
[46:23] second day of pentecost did you notice
[46:26] the quote number eight in the day of
[46:28] pentecost
[46:30] what a great thing we have there god who
[46:32] led the children of israel through the
[46:34] wilderness he that great pillar of fire
[46:37] and on the day of pentecost the great
[46:40] fire felt
[46:41] and divided itself
[46:44] among
[46:45] the people
[46:46] for me to live is christ
[46:48] but abram said hallelujah we can say
[46:51] hallelujah
[46:53] i believe that the same god that fell
[46:57] on the day of pentecost upon his church
[47:00] as a pillar of fire divided
[47:03] himself
[47:05] with cloven towns
[47:07] among his people
[47:09] is here
[47:11] brethren said tonight
[47:13] i can say this morning
[47:16] is the same god that he was then he is
[47:20] today with the same
[47:23] holy ghost
[47:25] blessed be the name of the lord
[47:30] any time when we had a pentecost he came
[47:32] down with a book
[47:35] and the prophet was in the land
[47:38] now
[47:40] the real
[47:42] the real pentecost
[47:45] it was not
[47:47] sinai
[47:49] not even zion because they lost their
[47:52] first love
[47:54] they felt
[47:56] the world test
[47:59] now we have another mountain
[48:04] sunset
[48:06] he came down with the book
[48:09] that book
[48:10] was not anymore
[48:12] commandments
[48:14] but was the marriage certificate
[48:18] and my name and your name was written
[48:21] right there
[48:24] seven two changes ended
[48:27] and the marriage has come
[48:30] and the christ came down
[48:33] actually he is here
[48:37] we are not called
[48:40] by a man
[48:42] we are individually called
[48:45] but the christ himself by the king
[48:48] theophany
[48:50] calling you a tiopani
[48:52] it's an invisible union
[48:57] what is the attraction of the mountain
[49:02] what happened on mount sunset
[49:06] god confirming his word
[49:09] all is that all this noise about
[49:12] god fulfilling his promised world
[49:15] revelation 1-7
[49:21] hallelujah
[49:22] and god of heaven promises the evening
[49:24] evening time we have evening lights
[49:28] you are an evening light
[49:31] three years ago
[49:32] this mystery was a prophecy
[49:36] now it's history
[49:38] it's past
[49:39] promise is fulfilled
[49:44] hallelujah
[49:47] the marriage of the lamp
[49:50] has come
[49:52] and now i believe she is ready to strike
[49:55] that final
[49:56] climbers
[49:58] to bring forth a faith
[50:01] or revelation that will rapture the
[50:03] church into glory
[50:05] and she is
[50:06] lying
[50:08] or laying
[50:10] in these messages
[50:13] we are really at the end time
[50:15] we have talked about and everything but
[50:17] the thing that moved up on us now
[50:21] here is one
[50:22] that's right
[50:24] but to the church the bride the rapture
[50:26] is a revelation
[50:29] it's revealed to her
[50:32] what is revealed to her
[50:34] the message didn't made us bright
[50:36] just revealed what always have been
[50:41] that's the revelation
[50:43] the true bride of christ will wait for
[50:46] the revelation
[50:48] of the rapture
[50:50] rapturing faith rapturing revelation
[50:53] through identity
[50:56] this is our true
[50:57] identity
[50:59] the three day today
[51:01] actually the son of man
[51:04] didn't came to bring faith
[51:07] he came to find
[51:11] faith
[51:12] brother brown said in faith he said
[51:14] faith is a subconscious thing
[51:18] he said faith is on subconscious things
[51:21] lady
[51:24] faith is not a mental act
[51:27] it's something that that you
[51:29] subconsciously do it
[51:32] people try to look to their intellect
[51:34] for faith
[51:35] when
[51:36] faith doesn't let day
[51:38] reason lay there
[51:41] faith lays
[51:43] in the soul
[51:46] it is not something that i manufacture
[51:52] think about eno
[51:56] in genesis chapter
[51:58] 5 verse 24
[52:01] when enoch is our type
[52:04] enoch
[52:05] walked
[52:06] with god
[52:08] how he walked with god
[52:10] he walked with the world
[52:13] and he says here and he was not
[52:16] when i walk with the world
[52:20] you cannot find me anymore
[52:24] you cannot find gabriel anymore
[52:27] because i walk with the spoken word
[52:31] actually and then and the verse continue
[52:34] because god
[52:35] took him
[52:37] that the that word took him isla
[52:40] means
[52:41] married him
[52:44] enoch
[52:46] what is hanok what is enoch
[52:49] teaching
[52:52] teaching
[52:54] walk
[52:55] with god
[52:57] what is god
[52:58] i left out
[53:00] in the beginning
[53:02] elohim are left out in the beginning 28
[53:05] words 28 letters first verse of the
[53:08] bible seven words
[53:11] 28 letters
[53:13] the fourth one
[53:16] it's a word nobody translated
[53:18] the first letter of the hebrew alphabet
[53:20] and the last one
[53:23] the greek translated in alpha in omega
[53:26] roman in a and z
[53:30] but actually this is a jewish bible it's
[53:33] a hebrew language
[53:35] and jesus said in the book of revelation
[53:39] i am alpha in omega
[53:42] in the beginning created god
[53:44] i left out
[53:46] in the beginning
[53:48] created god the word
[53:53] and eno
[53:55] walked with the world
[53:58] and he was not anymore
[54:00] god married him
[54:03] when married him
[54:06] after his character
[54:07] was molded
[54:10] after he was formed after he passed the
[54:14] world test
[54:16] abraham the same
[54:18] abraham
[54:20] father abraham
[54:22] moshe
[54:26] moses
[54:27] the teacher
[54:29] let's look at jesus
[54:32] jesus was anointed
[54:35] at jordan
[54:36] jordan means separation means death
[54:39] you get the holy ghost when you decide
[54:41] to die
[54:44] when you make a full surrender
[54:46] when you just have a
[54:49] clear-cut decision
[54:51] that you are going to follow the
[54:52] doctrine of this message
[54:54] the holy ghost just fell on you
[54:57] and you will have a
[54:59] holy ghost baptism without sensation
[55:04] because in seoul you don't have feelings
[55:07] you don't have senses
[55:10] i get the holy ghost with the pentecost
[55:12] in in my spirit
[55:14] and in my flesh
[55:16] i could speak i still speak in tongues
[55:19] i still had a lot of i had a lot of
[55:21] manifestation but i didn't have the
[55:23] baptisms with the holy ghost in my soul
[55:27] till one day i was it was midnight and
[55:31] my my wife translating me the message
[55:33] from hungarian
[55:36] the mark of the beast
[55:37] so i
[55:38] i stood up and i say from this day on i
[55:41] am going to follow the doctrine of this
[55:44] man
[55:46] then
[55:47] my soul
[55:49] changed
[55:52] so i know when i what is what means to
[55:54] to have the the mystery is a mystery
[55:56] even for many
[55:58] you know this is so so it was because it
[56:01] the prophet said is a mystery
[56:04] of the holy ghost without sensation
[56:08] by the person of jesus christ who is the
[56:10] person
[56:13] the word
[56:14] the anointed word
[56:17] jesus
[56:18] is the word in flesh
[56:21] jesus is the manifested word is christ
[56:24] anointed a flesh
[56:28] hallelujah
[56:31] so jesus was anointed jesus was baptized
[56:34] with the holy ghost as jordan
[56:37] you know that jesus the prophet said was
[56:39] fighting with himself
[56:42] if he is the world
[56:45] if jesus was fighting with himself
[56:48] how much we have to fight
[56:51] with ourself
[56:54] then jesus was adopted
[56:58] month of transfiguration
[57:01] this was his adoption
[57:07] what happened after adoption
[57:12] trials
[57:15] testings
[57:19] problems
[57:21] because the world has to be tested
[57:25] after he fulfilled all the righteousness
[57:29] after he applied
[57:31] all the world
[57:33] all the requirements
[57:37] then
[57:38] father said
[57:41] this is
[57:43] my beloved son this is my beloved
[57:46] daughter
[57:47] after
[57:48] he walked
[57:50] with the world
[57:52] after he submitted himself to the pillar
[57:56] of fire that was in him
[58:00] then god said
[58:02] this is my beloved son
[58:06] and then
[58:07] he need to be proven
[58:12] because
[58:13] i am divine
[58:15] the seventh i am of john
[58:18] the last the seventh one is i am divine
[58:20] i am the root you are the branches
[58:24] every branches
[58:26] they don't bring through it
[58:29] cut it
[58:30] they don't come to church anymore
[58:32] not even try to bring them back
[58:35] because you are not you are cutting them
[58:38] god is cutting them
[58:43] but
[58:44] those who bring fruit
[58:46] he purchased
[58:48] more problem
[58:53] more trials
[58:55] to bring more fruit
[58:58] that was good
[59:02] to become
[59:03] perfect
[59:06] look at the prophet and then jesus was
[59:09] was raptured
[59:11] after that his character was molded
[59:15] by suffering
[59:17] by testing
[59:19] it is it will be too nice
[59:22] to be raptured
[59:23] in this condition
[59:26] hallelujah we have a good music
[59:30] good atmosphere feel the light a good
[59:32] atmosphere many people good atmosphere
[59:36] the world
[59:37] brother brown said the last test that
[59:40] the bride has to face is the world test
[59:45] we need to be proven
[59:47] that we are the real adopted
[59:51] brother branham was baptized with the
[59:52] holy ghost
[59:54] he was adopted
[59:55] in the cloud
[59:58] when the lord took him in the club it
[59:59] was his adoption
[1:00:03] then look what happened in his ministry
[1:00:06] they rejected
[1:00:08] he was rejected by all
[1:00:11] and he has to stay alone
[1:00:14] and the bride has to come to a place
[1:00:20] i have to come to a place
[1:00:23] i have to stay alone
[1:00:26] and you have to stay alone
[1:00:29] with him
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:32] you have to step in the vision
[1:00:38] and after his character was molded
[1:00:43] perfect love projected
[1:00:46] i put here some
[1:00:48] because the lord walked me three o'clock
[1:00:50] in the morning
[1:00:51] and he was going in my head back and
[1:00:53] forth
[1:00:54] and
[1:00:55] he was telling me these things
[1:00:57] and then then i could see it
[1:01:00] is right there in the message
[1:01:02] and then he the holy spirit reminded me
[1:01:06] about a situation
[1:01:12] this is the sermon the reproach for the
[1:01:14] cause of the world the reproach
[1:01:19] 23.
[1:01:22] baptism is the holy ghost then and the
[1:01:24] holy spirit
[1:01:26] he was in a in a church and somebody did
[1:01:28] something very bad
[1:01:30] they misbehave
[1:01:32] in the presence of the lord
[1:01:34] and the holy spirit told him
[1:01:37] they are in your hands
[1:01:40] they mistreat you
[1:01:42] they are jealous on you
[1:01:44] they speak mean against you
[1:01:47] they are in your hands now
[1:01:50] they mess up your life
[1:01:53] he makes you suffer you
[1:01:55] he plays church he looks different
[1:01:59] but when he come home
[1:02:01] he's different
[1:02:04] now you have the spoken word you have
[1:02:06] the power to speak them out of existence
[1:02:09] they are in your hands now
[1:02:11] what you will do with them
[1:02:16] there was a holy hush
[1:02:18] everybody so deadly quiet
[1:02:21] oh god
[1:02:23] what must i do
[1:02:26] then i remember if he hadn't been the
[1:02:28] warning of the holy spirit two days
[1:02:30] before i said
[1:02:33] i
[1:02:34] forgive you
[1:02:36] now that was what he wanted me
[1:02:43] because after a while
[1:02:45] brother after all barbara said i've been
[1:02:48] guilty
[1:02:49] maybe not of that but guilty and guilty
[1:02:52] of the least is of the whole
[1:02:55] you see how humble the real revelation
[1:02:57] brings humbleness
[1:03:00] so i said i forgive you
[1:03:03] and there is the witnesses sitting right
[1:03:05] in the holy spirit fell through
[1:03:10] so the prophet
[1:03:12] has to be his character
[1:03:14] has to be formed first
[1:03:17] like hattie right
[1:03:19] like hated the right her character has
[1:03:21] to be molded
[1:03:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:03:28] perfect
[1:03:31] perfect love
[1:03:33] then the prophet
[1:03:35] was raptured
[1:03:36] so i went to give you the pattern now
[1:03:39] how the sins goes
[1:03:41] baptism is the holy ghost
[1:03:43] adoption
[1:03:45] is a public declaration
[1:03:47] then character has to be formed through
[1:03:49] trials and temptation to be proved
[1:03:52] and then perfect love
[1:03:55] and then rapture
[1:03:58] perfect love
[1:04:02] look at israel baptized in the water
[1:04:05] baptized with with the cloud which was
[1:04:08] the baptist was the holy ghost
[1:04:10] then the lord allowed them in the
[1:04:11] wilderness 40 years
[1:04:14] to be proven what is really in their
[1:04:16] heart
[1:04:18] israel felt
[1:04:20] look at church at the church
[1:04:23] baptized with the holy
[1:04:24] ghost she lost first love
[1:04:27] tried by the world
[1:04:29] rejected him
[1:04:31] but this bride
[1:04:35] was baptized in his name
[1:04:38] filled with the holy ghost
[1:04:40] adopted
[1:04:41] when we have been adopted when the
[1:04:44] prophet was talking in the crowd
[1:04:46] the prophet said all of us we have a
[1:04:48] representation there
[1:04:52] brother brown said i am a part of that
[1:04:54] bride
[1:04:55] so when he was adopted we have been
[1:04:57] adopted in the hall
[1:05:00] with the cloud
[1:05:01] then test
[1:05:03] her heart
[1:05:04] is tested by the world
[1:05:08] than
[1:05:09] the rapture
[1:05:12] so our pentecost is revelation 10 7
[1:05:18] and now we are in the time of
[1:05:21] character
[1:05:29] now i'm coming to closing
[1:05:34] as he being the groom the bride has to
[1:05:36] come forward because it's part of him
[1:05:40] she's the esther she have half half of
[1:05:42] the kingdom not william branham get half
[1:05:45] of the kingdom it is not land to share
[1:05:48] it is power authority
[1:05:51] spoken word power
[1:05:54] deity
[1:05:57] and it only can be the manifestation of
[1:06:00] the fulfilling of all the revelation
[1:06:02] any other spoke of the bride
[1:06:06] it can only manifest if he does
[1:06:09] something different than the groom it is
[1:06:11] in the bride
[1:06:13] she is flesh of his flesh born of his
[1:06:15] life of his life power of his power she
[1:06:18] is him
[1:06:21] a man and woman are one
[1:06:24] woman taken from his side
[1:06:26] she had taken a spirit
[1:06:29] the feminist
[1:06:30] holy ghost
[1:06:32] you holy ghost people
[1:06:36] you holy ghost people
[1:06:39] you feminist spirit
[1:06:43] you
[1:06:46] feminist
[1:06:49] part
[1:06:50] of logos
[1:06:53] embodied today
[1:06:56] what do you say about
[1:06:58] yourself what shall i tell them
[1:07:01] who sent us to you
[1:07:03] they asked john the baptist
[1:07:05] what do you say about yourself
[1:07:07] what do you say about yourself
[1:07:10] it is written
[1:07:12] in the
[1:07:13] scroll of the book
[1:07:17] the flesh of his side
[1:07:18] both mechanics and dynamics the wife the
[1:07:21] spirit of him and the flesh of him put
[1:07:23] together
[1:07:26] hmm we are coming to our conclusion
[1:07:30] as the eternal lord was god manifested
[1:07:32] in the sun
[1:07:34] in jesus dwelt the fullness of god that
[1:07:36] bodily the eternal one was father
[1:07:39] manifested in flesh thereby
[1:07:42] gaining the title of a son
[1:07:44] even so
[1:07:46] we
[1:07:48] somebody said even so
[1:07:52] this is this is
[1:07:53] this is hard
[1:07:56] even so i am so happy
[1:07:59] i just behave because i will run
[1:08:02] because i i see it
[1:08:05] even so me
[1:08:09] eternal in his thoughts
[1:08:12] in my turn
[1:08:16] became
[1:08:18] many members spoken word seed
[1:08:21] manifested in flesh
[1:08:23] and those
[1:08:25] eternal
[1:08:27] thoughts
[1:08:30] real
[1:08:31] and eternal
[1:08:33] you you real you is real
[1:08:37] when he saw you
[1:08:39] actually we are not only predestinated
[1:08:43] judah was predestinated
[1:08:47] the first grace that was given to us is
[1:08:50] election
[1:08:53] he tore up himself
[1:08:56] he pulled the part of himself
[1:08:59] and place it in your heart
[1:09:03] this is what we are who don't believe it
[1:09:07] is not a part of the drama
[1:09:11] because this is rapturing revelation
[1:09:15] hallelujah
[1:09:16] he brought your
[1:09:18] identity that's why when you saw the
[1:09:21] pillar of fire you saw you were origin
[1:09:24] when you saw the cry the cloud
[1:09:27] you recognize it
[1:09:28] because you have been
[1:09:31] teached by the father you have been with
[1:09:35] him from the beginning
[1:09:37] you have heard from god
[1:09:40] this is really you
[1:09:45] these eternal souls tell to somebody
[1:09:48] eternal salt
[1:09:51] manifested in flesh
[1:09:54] are the sons of god
[1:09:56] we did not become saved by rebirth
[1:10:00] we were seed
[1:10:03] only
[1:10:04] the elect can be born
[1:10:08] because
[1:10:09] we were seed
[1:10:11] we could be quickened
[1:10:14] and this is the holy ghost baptism
[1:10:19] hallelujah
[1:10:24] unless that is constructed by god
[1:10:26] it won't stand
[1:10:29] no denomination alex is this constructed
[1:10:31] by god
[1:10:32] construction here will not stand
[1:10:36] it has to come the way god build it
[1:10:39] it can't come any other way not creed
[1:10:42] not by joining not by this not by
[1:10:44] sensations
[1:10:46] it's got to come by the way of the cross
[1:10:49] it's got to come by the way of the blood
[1:10:52] is god to come and be filled with the
[1:10:54] holy ghost
[1:10:55] is god to be holy ghost
[1:10:59] material
[1:11:01] what he's saying here
[1:11:04] holy ghost
[1:11:05] my what is this message
[1:11:08] think about
[1:11:10] holy ghost material
[1:11:16] and holy ghost
[1:11:18] materials makes
[1:11:20] holy ghost
[1:11:22] people
[1:11:26] holy ghost people
[1:11:28] muslim how are you
[1:11:32] bockertov
[1:11:33] good morning
[1:11:36] peace be unto you
[1:11:38] always well
[1:11:42] it's already revealed
[1:11:46] hallelujah
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:49] so brad has her adoption
[1:11:52] and he said this is my beloved bride
[1:11:58] what's next
[1:12:01] character forming
[1:12:03] in the oven of the suffering
[1:12:06] he's looking for her character
[1:12:10] the character of christ how was formed
[1:12:12] by suffering
[1:12:14] not by a lot of noise and jumping and
[1:12:17] running
[1:12:20] by be tested by the world
[1:12:24] it is not just joining
[1:12:25] church sunday
[1:12:27] sings or
[1:12:29] seeing very nice as the lord god said
[1:12:32] the prophet
[1:12:33] push play
[1:12:34] or it is not
[1:12:37] it is not healing
[1:12:40] it is not listening it's healing
[1:12:44] they listen
[1:12:46] but they know they don't hear
[1:12:49] because everything the fruits has to be
[1:12:52] his life
[1:12:55] perfect love
[1:12:57] perfect love
[1:12:58] is not manifested when we eat together
[1:13:01] it's not manifested when we are agreeing
[1:13:04] when everybody says nice things about me
[1:13:07] perfect love manifest in a different
[1:13:09] condition
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:13] he chooses a bride to reflect his
[1:13:14] character
[1:13:16] the modern churches of today
[1:13:18] certainly the misses
[1:13:21] of course they have to give something
[1:13:22] else to the people
[1:13:25] you know
[1:13:27] they have to sell this
[1:13:29] wonderful experiences sunday monday
[1:13:32] we are different
[1:13:35] seems to be
[1:13:37] the truth
[1:13:39] he is looking for the day for that bride
[1:13:41] to be formed
[1:13:42] hebrew 38
[1:13:44] not revelation 3 8
[1:13:48] this is different
[1:13:49] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:13:51] and forever
[1:13:52] just exactly like it was like he was
[1:13:56] it's got to be his the same flesh some
[1:13:58] bones on spin everything
[1:14:02] and them too then
[1:14:04] became one
[1:14:06] until the church became dead
[1:14:09] they are not one
[1:14:11] this is chosen of a bride
[1:14:13] the baptist people in los angeles leave
[1:14:15] the church
[1:14:16] because we the only things we know we
[1:14:19] need to go to do good deeds
[1:14:21] if we we do good deeds we are bright we
[1:14:24] are we don't do good deeds we are not
[1:14:26] bright
[1:14:28] so this man is telling us here that we
[1:14:31] need to have a character as jesus christ
[1:14:33] to be formed
[1:14:36] make no sense for the denomination
[1:14:38] for us
[1:14:39] makes sense
[1:14:42] hallelujah
[1:14:44] the character of him the world
[1:14:46] for this age
[1:14:47] must be molded
[1:14:49] she must be molded
[1:14:51] like he is character is a victory not a
[1:14:54] gift
[1:14:55] a man without character can reign
[1:14:57] because power apart from character
[1:15:00] is satanic
[1:15:03] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:15:06] and since he wants us
[1:15:08] to share even his throne
[1:15:11] to the same basis that he overcome and
[1:15:13] it's it's set down at his father throne
[1:15:16] we have to overcome and sit with him
[1:15:22] i'm closing and i'm not lying
[1:15:27] perfect love perfect faith perfect
[1:15:30] knowledge
[1:15:31] this is next
[1:15:36] not a faith but perfect faith
[1:15:40] build it up in here
[1:15:42] watch a perfect god
[1:15:45] with a perfect heart
[1:15:47] keep a perfect promise
[1:15:49] by his perfect world
[1:15:51] with a sharper than two-edged sword
[1:15:54] discerning of the thoughts of the heart
[1:15:57] we are coming now to the perfection
[1:16:00] because the people has to come to this
[1:16:02] in order for the rapture
[1:16:05] that's that's holding it away right now
[1:16:07] it's waiting for that
[1:16:10] church to come into that perfect
[1:16:13] raptured
[1:16:14] faith
[1:16:16] looking for it
[1:16:17] it means a lot of
[1:16:19] shaving down for me it means a lot for
[1:16:21] you but together we'll make it by the
[1:16:24] grace of god
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:29] blessed be the name
[1:16:32] of the lord are you happy this morning
[1:16:42] he left his church a measure of
[1:16:44] suffering
[1:16:47] by their faith in god
[1:16:49] while suffering for him
[1:16:50] will come to a place
[1:16:52] of perfection
[1:16:56] amen
[1:16:58] this is
[1:16:59] where we are going to
[1:17:05] first
[1:17:06] he called us
[1:17:09] because he called us
[1:17:11] and because we are son he gave us the
[1:17:13] baptism with the holy ghost
[1:17:16] that make us
[1:17:17] to receive the word
[1:17:20] you cannot deceive the whole the world
[1:17:22] what we believe without the holy ghost
[1:17:24] it's impossible amen
[1:17:26] is to touch
[1:17:30] and then you are adopted
[1:17:33] when you are adopted god change your
[1:17:35] appeal
[1:17:37] you look different speak different
[1:17:39] think different
[1:17:41] and then
[1:17:42] testing and trials come
[1:17:44] he is molding your character
[1:17:48] and after your character is molded
[1:17:51] god
[1:17:52] forgive them
[1:17:53] they don't know what they are doing
[1:17:57] perfect love
[1:18:00] hallelujah
[1:18:02] perfect love
[1:18:04] can i say thus says the lord
[1:18:08] nothing will bring us there
[1:18:11] only perfect
[1:18:14] let us stand by himself
[1:18:17] are you happy in this morning
[1:18:20] we are already adopted
[1:18:22] we are already baptized with the holy
[1:18:24] ghost with our sensation in our soul
[1:18:27] because it's a promise
[1:18:30] we don't deserve it
[1:18:32] we cannot be the so good that we deserve
[1:18:35] to be baptized with the holy ghost
[1:18:37] because we were sons he gave us the holy
[1:18:41] ghost
[1:18:43] what is the evidence
[1:18:45] i can believe such a strange message
[1:18:55] and then i have such a lot of problems
[1:18:58] and problems
[1:18:59] and the devil is telling me is telling
[1:19:01] you you are not because you you should
[1:19:03] be so good nice husband you should be so
[1:19:06] nice mother
[1:19:08] it's it's just god is perfecting us
[1:19:12] you must have perfect revelation
[1:19:16] if you want
[1:19:18] you have more proofs that we are not
[1:19:21] that you are
[1:19:23] 90 of our experiences are negative

[1:19:49] something in our heart
[1:19:52] you baptize that with the holy ghost to
[1:19:54] stand in the process of formation
[1:19:57] of molding our character
[1:19:59] how can we do it without the holy ghost
[1:20:03] how can we follow the message
[1:20:05] how can we stay in those these trials

[1:22:28] the love of god shown to the world
[1:22:32] for he's changing
[1:22:36] changing me
[1:22:38] from earthly things to the
[1:22:42] heavenly

[1:23:23] heavenly
[1:23:25] dislikeness and image to perfecting me
[1:23:35] amen
[1:23:36] i was thinking as our brother was
[1:23:38] preaching that
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:40] god knows how to extract the perfume out
[1:23:43] of the rose
[1:23:45] and it would take some pressure and
[1:23:47] under the pressure the fragrance is
[1:23:49] unleashed and there's there's a life of
[1:23:51] christ on the inside but many times it
[1:23:54] takes those negative circumstances to
[1:23:57] bring the right reaction out of us
[1:23:59] that'll display the life of christ we're
[1:24:02] so many times we don't want the negative
[1:24:04] we don't want the negative we don't want
[1:24:05] the trial we don't want the pressure i
[1:24:08] mean i spent all my time trying to pray
[1:24:10] away the pressure
[1:24:12] pray away the troubles and and escape
[1:24:14] them all but those are the very things
[1:24:16] god's using the pres
[1:24:18] to test the bride to whether or not
[1:24:20] she'll stay with the word and when she
[1:24:22] chooses the word over herself and a
[1:24:24] surrender to his will the fragrance
[1:24:27] becomes comes out the character comes
[1:24:30] out
[1:24:31] amen so we thank god for all things amen
[1:24:35] thank him for what he's doing and now we
[1:24:37] understand
[1:24:38] why life is not meant to be easy
[1:24:42] brother baby said it's not easy he said
[1:24:43] it wasn't meant to be easy
[1:24:46] it was meant for our perfection amen
[1:24:49] amen i thank god for that i thank god
[1:24:51] that he'd given us eyes to see or we
[1:24:53] would be so confused about our own lives
[1:24:55] but he's given us eyes to see that we'll
[1:24:57] understand even our daily life
