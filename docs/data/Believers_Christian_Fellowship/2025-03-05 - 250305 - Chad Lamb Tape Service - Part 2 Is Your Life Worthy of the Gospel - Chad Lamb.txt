allowed us this opportunity to gather again on a Wednesday night that you've kept us and you've drawn us and God I pray that you would just bless us now as we hear your word may we hear them with more than natural ears but may there be ears of hearing that are deep in our soul and may you open those ears and open our understanding that we might gain a revelation upon this word that we might see you Lord more than with more clarity than we ever have before we might see our day and our age and our position in you Lord help us I pray bless us in all we say and do and all that we hear this evening and may you be glorified in it all and may we lord gain that portion that we need of for this life we love you we thank you for this opportunity and we pray you would take preeminence in our hearts in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you we're going to let you have your seats for just a minute thank you musicians as you know we're going into part two on our tape service on uh is your life worthy of the Gospel hopefully remember to bring your books or you have an electronic version we'll also have the words on the overhead so you can follow along on those as well um just wanted to uh remind you that brother Ron Garvin and brother John Brooks are still traveling they're almost hitting the midsection of their trip so they've got quite a long trip and they've still got quite a lot of ground to cover I checked in with both of them today and they're both doing good they're feeling healthy and they've done well so just remember them in prayer and remember their family as well and their absence also be praying for Brother Kyle wer he'll be traveling he and sister Carrie will be traveling to Oregon to minister for Brother Rich Cobb this weekend so I know that he would appreciate your prayers as well and then brother um I spoke with um brother Gabe Smith and he made it back he made it back safely from this past week in ministering for Brother John and he was going to come to church this evening but started feeling unwell just before he came so we want to remember brother Gabe as well in our prayers amen but he had a good trip he said it was he had a good time and had good Services man uh as we go into um the service can you pull up the PowerPoint brother Franco as as we go into the book we listen to the first section last Wednesday we'll listen to part two another section of it this Wednesday and then we'll have next Wednesday to finish it Lord willing I want to uh I want to do a a little review uh but first let's stand together and read the opening scripture I want us to be reminded of the scripture that brother random opened with sometimes when we break it into sections we forget the scripture that he opened with and I want to keep that top of mind and remember we're going into is your life worthy of the Gospel that's the that's the title we want to hold that in our minds that's what brother B's talking about and that's what he's trying to show us is your life worthy of the gospel and he's trying to show us what what a life worthy of the Gospel is and what a life not worthy of the Gospel is and if you remember last time when we looked at it we found out it wasn't a life that had everything right and all their ducks in a row and always did everything perfect but a life that was worthy of the Gospel is someone who received the gospel for their age when it was presented to them and somebody who was not worthy of the Gospel was somebody who rejected the word when it came to them in their day and age and so it was much simpler than we thought amen very very simple so let's look at uh Luke chapter 14 this is the opening scripture brother renham opened with and read to the congregation Luke chap 14 and we'll begin with uh verse 16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bid come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five Yol of oxen and I go to prove them I pray that you have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the Halt and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were and shall taste of my supper let's turn from there back to Matthew 22 Matthew 22 isn't a scripture brother bham read but he referred to it and told the people to read it later but he refers to it a couple times so let's look at Matthew 22 and we'll begin at verse one Matthew 22 and 1 and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come into the marriage but they made light of it and went their way and one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their City then said he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy this is where brother Brenham gets his title those who were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guest that's where we read this at the end of the last service and we realized that the the wedding was furnished with both bad and good as many as would heed the call so praise God I'm one of those bad ones that got invited to the wedding and I heeded the call praise be to God so we can see this is not something worthy of the Gospel it's not something based on perfect conduct it's based on an ability to receive the invitation and respond to the invitation amen you can have your seats if you'll take your book uh your book or if you have the electronic version if you'll open that up I want to just highlight a few things as we move on um if we go to page in the book we go to page 36 at the bottom of page nine I'm sorry paragraph 36 at the bottom of page nine and read a couple things that brother bam said said now we see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something or to receive the invitation that he gives him and he and he returns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is spurned but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy there's only one thing left and that is judgment and we find that man has done that in all ages it's happened most every age in the Bible we turn to the next page and go to the bottom of page 11 brother B said America 15 years ago when the Great healing Revival continued on from Pentecost broke out in the nation and there was revivals in the capital Washington DC the presidents vice presidents great people Governors great things taking place Governors and men were healed like Congressman Upshaw and been a crippled for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before them but they turned it down and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she is doomed there is no hope for it at all she has crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected in what she has here to control the nation so that he's speaking of John F Kennedy so he shows that the nation is doomed why is the nation doomed not because of the immorality not because of the decision those all came secondarily they were doomed when they turned down the invitation then all these things followed so you can say this nation is doomed it's finished because of uh uh of transgenderism because of immoral ity because of all of that no they're doomed this nation is doomed because it refused the invitation and when it refused the invitation it separated itself from the presence of God and then immorality and divorce and remarriage and all these things came in afterwards so it's really important let's go down to um uh let's go to page 14 paragraph 59 at the top some some kind something some kind of excuse it's too hot I'm too tired I will tomorrow just some kind of an excuse that's all they do by rejecting the day of visitation it separates you from God that's why the churches fail the Nations fail people fail it's because they rejected the invitation and separated themselves from God and then all these other things come behind let's turn together to page 21 this is where we stopped last time and we're going to go into the questions here in a minute but we're going to read from the beginning of um paragraph 108 here on page 21 all the way to the top of page uh 41 today and that'll be the section we go through now so if you want to get out your pen and your paper and jot down these questions we'll go ahead and go through the questions and uh these questions will be answered throughout the service today first question a Christian cannot be a Christian until what and you as I said before sometimes these questions are worded a little funny but they're worded funny because of the way brother bam says something so it's worded in light of the way he addresses an issue and in in every question if we just take it the grand scheme of things could have many many different answers but that's not what we're looking for we're looking for how he addresses it in this in this sermon here a Christian cannot be a Christian until what what will produce relationship with God what will produce relationship with God what is one thing to know that you're a Christian what is one thing to know that you're a Christian and the last question this evening will be what creates an atmosphere around us so before we start the tape we'll give you just a second to jot those down this is where speed writing comes in handy shorthand all right if you're done with the questions you can turn to page 21 we'll begin at paragraph 108 here in the middle of page 21 brother Franco if you want to go ahead and queue up the audio and start playing it now thank you I had a little something that happened in Mexico not long ago General valinia elected of God the light shined across his path once in one of the meetings that great Catholic Warrior one of the highest Generals in Mexico come humbly to The Altar and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he went back down in Mexico he kept crying to me come down there finally out to decided to go down the Lord led me had a vision told my wife went down there and what he did him being one of their Chief generals fourstar General he went to the headquarters of the government and they they're hard against Protestants down there you know so they know this going to be a terrific meeting so he went down there and got a militia guard and when they did they got the big arena and they was going to bring me in like that the government was bringing in so when they did the the bishop one of the great Bishops of the Catholic Church went up to him to the governor and said sir I understand that you're bringing in a non Catholic he said yes what about it why he said you can't have a man like that in here this government has never know to doing a thing like that but said we've done it now he said well I said the man's a reputable man I understand it thousands of people comes out to hear him General valinia he's my bosom friend he said and the president himself's ping you know Methodist so he said he said the man's a reputable man as far as I know said General valdini here he's converted under this man said well he's as far as I know a reputable person said thousands of people that claim will come hear him and this uh Bishop said what kind of a people is it sir just the ignorant that's the ones that goes here a person like that the president said sir you've had them for 500 years why are they ignorant that was enough that settled it oh my that DEH hared him yes sir then when that little baby was raised from the dead I sent a Runner behind the man the lady was sing in Spanish the baby died this morning at 9:00 and it's pouring down rain having about 10,000 converts to Christ each night the night before an old blind man uh had received his sight on the platform oh three or four times size this Tabernacle about that high old Shaws and hats landay and I just they let me down on ropes in a ring to get me in I walked out there and started preaching by faith Billy come said Daddy you going have to do something that woman said I got 300 archers standing there and they can't stop a little bitty woman weigh 100 pounds nearly and pretty little lady about so high about oh maybe her first baby I'd say she's 23 25 years old and she's standing there in her hair hanging down and holding a little baby and she'd make a lunge for that line the man would push her back she' climb up over the top of that baby on her hip anyway go between their legs or anything they get her up there had to kick her off the platform and they didn't handle prayer card to give her he said if I let her come in there daddy well that dead baby with old prayer card and said them others standing there's been standing here two or three days in that rain and sun and let her get ahead of them said it'll cause a a fuss down there I said that's all right brother Moore was there and he's kind of baldheaded like me and I said she don't know who's who so many people I said send and and a couple of the brethen one of the bre here Tabernacle that um he's gone to Glory now I can't think of his name just at this time but he was standing back there so I said Brother Moore go down and pray for the baby she'll never know who was me or you just go on down and not able to speak English and so uh brother Bo said all right brother BR start walked down I said as I was saying Fai and I seen a little baby little Mexican baby sitting in front of me just laughing I said wait a minute and I said let the little lady through Billy said I can't do that Daddy say I said I saw a vision Billy said oh that's different so we opened up the crowd like that brought her through here she come falling on her knees with a prayer beads in her hand I said get up so I said heavenly father now I don't know what you're going to do I don't know where you just want me to satisfy the woman by praying for the baby or what I said I lay my hands upon the little baby in the name of the Lord Jesus just the same things that did the brother way laying there on the floor dead the other day and the blanket kicked and that little baby started screaming and was to its life when i s a runner brother esposas to go with her to the doctor and get a sworn affidavit from the doctor that baby died that's by 10:00 that night died that morning at 9:00 in his office was pneumonia they got a sworn statement from the doctor the papers couldn't keep that still you know so they had to come over and they interviewed me and they said to me he said do you think that our Saints could do that too I said if they're living or he said you can't be singe until you're dead there you are see and the people you see the other day where they had this none they played up in the paper so a new Saint died oh 100 years ago or something like that they made a Canon I her now made a saint out of her and they said that she come back from the dead and prayed for some sick person that had leukemia wasn't this in one of the magazines just think how they try to play that up and one of these hundreds and hundreds of cases right under the nose of the people here what's that thing for a thing to play the Protestant church right into it see they can think something man the real works of the Lord was perfectly Vindicated proed there Daron to touch of paper with it there you are they received an invitation and turned it down yes sir they can't understand how a simple message a simple people to reject a thing like that would cause them to go into chaos a woman said to me Grand Pastor Oregon sometime ago Catholic girl come out there to condemn and right up the newspaper report a pack of cigarettes in her hand and she said I want to talk to you I said what does she want to say she said I want to ask you some questions about this religion of yours and I said what is it you want to ask and she said by what Authority you do this I said in the name of Jesus Christ by a Divine call and she went ahead smart off I said just a minute she said if I had to associate with that bunch of ignoramuses up there she said I wouldn't even want to be a Christian she said and if them they say that them people are rule the Earth someday she said I hope I'm not here I said don't worry you won't be I said you have to worry about that well she said all that there carrying on and screaming I said and you claim to be a Catholic she said I am I said did you know the Blessed Virgin Mary had to receive the Holy Ghost and speak in tongues and dance in the spirit the same way they did before God a receive her you call her the mother of God she said that's nonsense that I just a minute uh how am I supposed to look at the Bible I said then how you going to know what's truth or not she said I take my church word I said this is God's word here it is right here I'll challenge you to look at it and Mary was with them up there in the upper room and receiv received a baptism of the Holy Ghost after and you call her the mother of God the Lord I said then call that bunch of trash backwash I said don't worry you won't be there you don't have much to worry about if that's all you got to worry about you better worry about your own sinful Soul girl and I let her go now think of all this a simple God makes it so simple how could Ahab how could Jezebel how could those people who thought that Elijah was a witch thought he was a spiritualist even Ahab said here's the one that's caused all this trouble to Israel he said you're the ones troubled Israel how could that Nation think that to reject the message of a fuzzy face man like that no Priestly garments on and so forth would be the condemnation of how could Egypt that rule the world pharaohs and his class and dignity the world has never come to that place again and Science and so forth how could they think to reject an old prophet of 80 years old with Whiskers hanging down gray hair stomping out of there a fugitive and come out there with a message you'll either let them go or God will destroy the nation amen how could Pharaoh you obey me Pharaoh Pharaoh said obey oh him pharaoh and an old man some old Crank that all turn her God down like that destroy is but it did it oh my let's stop pause a few minutes and have a prayer and think what day are we living in where are we at in another modern scientific age we better think maybe you stop people stop pray a little while and think a little bit you feel better you have to get through doing it that's right a Christian is not a tool or some kind of a mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime that's right a Christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organization moving a Christian that is not a Christian a Christian is to be Christlike and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man the life of Christ in him then it produces the life that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did what am I talking about personal relationship to Christ what is it is your life worthy of the Gospel now I'm trying to lay that background there to show you that man and women who will renown women man the Bible said did you notice last Sunday night something I forgot to put in Genesis sixth chapter and the fourth verse those men who taken to them women for wives were a man of old Renown renowned man predicted to come again like it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man renowned man taking women not wives women going after strange flesh look in England a couple weeks ago look in the united look everywhere it's full of prostitution great man great High offices bringing disgrace upon the Nations running after women that great man there in England some kind of a warlord like why' you notice he had a pretty wife her picture was there long look at that Russian prostitute but she's all sexy dressed and throw herself out there to display her female flesh and the man fell apart what we need today is sons of God God we need man in government that's sons of God that's right therefore a good Godly king would stop all this nonsense there wouldn't be no strings to pull like David did he put a stop to it certainly did because he was a king and there was only the real way is God being the king and God sends a prophet didn't Samuel tell them before they ever got a king he said God's your king have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass they said no that's right have I ever bummed you for your living no you never did bum us for a living I've never told you enough but what was right before the Lord said God is your king oh we realize that we know you're a good man Samuel we believe the word of the Lord comes to you but we want a king anyhow that's what they get Pentecost want an organization anyhow you got it that's right want to be like the rest of the churches you are go ahead that that's just why it takes but God is our King God is our king that's what is it is because that the people like they did in the days of Christ like they have in every age they find an excuse they have their own Creeds you might not want to say I I bought a cow and I got to go see where she she work or not or give milk or what stock she is you might not have that excuse but here's the kind of excuse that people make say I'm a presbyterian we don't believe in that I'm Baptist we don't believe in no such stuff as that well I'm a Lutheran well that don't have anything to do with it that don't mean you're Christian that means that you belong to a bunch of people that's organizing you belong to the Lutheran Lodge the Baptist Lodge the Pentecostal Lodge there is no such a thing as Pentecostal Church there is no such a thing as Baptist Church it's Baptist Lodge Pentecostal LGE Presbyterian Lodge but there's only one church and there's only one way you can get into it that's by birth you're born into the Church of Jesus Christ and a member of his body of the spiritual delegation of heaven then the signs that Christ is with you lives through you Christians all you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a son of God you must become relation to God he must be your father in order for you to be a son and only his sons and daughters are saved not the members of a church but Sons and Daughters there's only thing one thing that will produce that that's the new birth the new birth is the only thing that will produce relationship to God is that right Sons and Daughters then when this takes place then the man here's the question I want to get to you the man says what do we do then after we've been born again so many asked me that question what should I do then brother brand if you are born again your entire nature is changed you are dead to the things you once thought well you say brother brandom when I joined church I got that well then when God said Jesus Christ is the same yeserday and forever he still heals the sick he still shows Vision but brother Brandon my church you're not born again you can't be for if the very God if his life is in you like that you're in the life of your father and if the very life of God is in you and the Very spirit that was in Christ in you how can the spirit live in Jesus Christ and write this and then come back down in you and deny that can't do it it'll punctuate every word to be sto then if you say well I'm a good member of the church that don't have one thing to do with it I know the Heathen Down in Africa amongst my dark Brethren down there I find the morals of them people higher than than 90% of the American people while in some of the tribes there if a young girl is not married till she's a certain age or when she's a certain size and no one has taken her yet they know these something wrong they excommunicate her she take off tribal paint and she goes to the city then she just becomes a Renegade and when she's married she's tested for her vcy if the little virgent bail is broke then she has to tell who done it and they kill them both together would it be a lot of Killing In America if that taken place then you call them heathens oh my they can come teach people to call themselves church members how to live clean that's right never found one case of aeral in the whole trip through South Africa you don't have such a thing there he are see it's just our own dirty filthy ways it's white people that's right got away from God when this takes place the thing you do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the New Birth you will believe and do everything that God says in his words for you to do amen and everything that the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate with amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it amen that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit you say will I speak with tongues you might do that and you might not will I shout you might do that you might not but there's one sure thing you will do you will bear the Fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace Faith longsuffering meekness gentleness patience your temper not be just remember when you got that that poisons the holy spirit away from you when you get to a place that you want to fuss with everybody you come along to there's something wrong when you get a place where the a minister read from the Bible That's wrong to do a certain thing you just remember there's no Christianity there at all that's now that by the fruits you shall know that that's what Jesus says see if it's the word and God said so yet spirit in you will cope with that word every time because genuine Holy Spirit Will cope with the word because the word is life in spirit Jesus said my words are life and if you've got eternal life and he is the word how can the word deny the word that's right what kind of a person would you make God that's one thing to know that you're a Christian when you can ful agree upon every word of God and you find yourself in love with your enemies somebody said well he's nothing but a holy rer and you start get oh be careful be careful but when you really find yourself that you love regardless of what they do you still love them then you're begin to find and your patience gets from about that long till just don't have no end anybody just keeps saying things about you I don't care what you say don't get stirred up if he get stirred up you better go pray first before he talk to him again don't get in fusses don't like to get in fuss if you like to see somebody raised up in the church say you know what I tell you so and so did so and say say nah brother shame on you if you say oh is that so listen to that Scandal watch out the holy spirit's not a Cess pool no no no the heart is occupied by the holy spirit is full of Holiness Purity thinketh no evil doeth no Evil believeth all things endureth longsuffering see don't fuss when the family gets in a fuss don't fuss with them your mother say I ain't having you going up that church anymore why you all you think about now you're Let Your Hair gr look like some old grandma don't fuss with her say okay mother it's all right I love you just the same and I'll be praying for you as long as I live now don't fuss see keer breathe temper first thing you know you grieve the Holy Spirit Away you you be fussing back then the Holy Spirit takes his flight temper breeds temper and love breeds love be full of love Jesus said this will all man you your my disciples when you have love one for another that's the fruit of the Holy Spirit love and did you know you are a little Creator yourself do you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why just that loving type of person haven't you seen that justce kind you like to be around them that's they create that atmosphere of the life they live the way they talk their conversation then you've seen those that every time you you shut them all the time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody say oh my there they come they going to criticize somebody there he's in your now he's going to talk about this man all they're go to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around see they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere I went into a man's office here in this city and a man is a trustee or a deacon it is in a fine church now I went in there to see that man about some business and there's a radio over there at that rock and roll or twist everywhere was just as hard as it could go and I guess there was 40 Pinups in his office of nude women now you can't tell me how much Deacon or how much more you let me see what you look at what you read and the kind of music you listen to the crowd you associate with and I'll tell you what kind of a spirit's in you you hear God say me do so and so that bunch of just remember I don't care what he says his words speaks louder his action speaks louder than what anything to think he could testify say as a Christian sure and maybe do anything but you just watch the kind of a life he lives that tells what he is now could you imagine that a man with a life that would say the believe in Divine Healing that's something for the birds that was back in years ago there's no such a thing today is that a life worthy of the Gospel that Christ was wounded for our transgressions and with the stripes we were healed you say but I'm a deacon I don't care you might be a bishop when I heard Bishop Sheen say about two years ago coming down every turnning on again when he said a man that would believe and try to live by that Bible was like somebody trying to walk through muddy waters Bishop Sheen then turned around and said when I get to heaven you know what when I meet Jesus I'm going to tell him I'm Bishop Sheen and he said oh yes I heard my mother speak of you paganism man that would blaspheme that word God be merciful I ain't the judge that word's the truth that's right the spirit of God will recognize his own writing he's identified by his writing it it it speaks of him and you're identified by believing it that it gives you your credentials of identification don't fuss with others and don't uh and don't have these family fusses as I said love breeds love and temper breeds temper now now let's watch look at Jesus just for a minute he was your example I hope you're not getting too tired look let's look at Jesus just a minute he was our example he said so for I have given you an example that you should do to others as I've done to you now watch when he came into the world when there was more as much unbelief in the world right then as there ever was it didn't even slow him up he went right on preaching just the same and healing just the thing never bothered him there was critics the man was criticized from the time he was a baby until he died on the cross did it stop him no sir what was his goal always do that which the father has written always do what's pleasing look at Jesus talk about us humbling ourselves when God himself became a baby instead of coming in a a little crib somewhere in a decent home was barned out there over a manure Pile in a stable amongst balling cab they wrapped him his swy closes off the neck of a Yol of an ox the poorest of the poorest and yet the creator of heavens and earth one cold rainy night they said Master we'll go home with you he said the foxes has whole and the birds has Nest but I don't even have a place to lay my head God jovah humble himself and become a man represented in sinful flesh to redeem you and me who are we then he was our example who am I nothing I was telling someone this afternoon in a little meeting I that every son that's born of God has to be tried first chasen I remember when I had mine my greatest hour when a when a man's born to get there's a little spotlike size of his fingernail that God injects into him system and it falls into his heart and there are anchors then Satan makes him prove it and if that ain't there you're gone I remember there in the hospital I about 22 years old 23 Maybe long as young man and my father dying in my arms and me talking to God Is A Healer and my own father in a heart attack lady his head in my arm and me praying for him and see him turn those eyes and look at me and fall off to go to meet God I took him over and bearded him by the side of my brother and the flowers are still fresh on his grave and me preaching a God that heals the sick working for the Public Service Company for 20 cents an hour and my wife working out shirt factory to help us make a

wouldn't even talk to me then if he wouldn't talk to me it was Satan's time he said I thought you said he was a good God what's all this you're hollering about you're just a boy look around over the city every girl and every boy you ever associal with think you've lost your mind you have now you couldn't tell me there's no God cuz I'd already seen it but he told me he didn't care for me said all night long all day long I said that to god what have I done show me Lord don't let the innocent have to suffer for me if I've done wrong I didn't know he was trying me but every son that comes to God's got to be tried I said tell me what I've done I'll make it right what have I done but preach all day long and all night long and just giving my life constantly what have I done Satan said that's right you see now comes to you and you've told all of them that you believe it he's a great healer and there lays your baby laying there dying he refused even year and your wife died with two berkers pneumonia you said he could heal Cancers and there he is now you talk about him being good and how good he is to people what about you then I begin to listen to him that's reasoning I thought that's right said he could just you don't have to speak the word just look to your baby to live I said that's right and his as much as you've done for him and yet that's what he does for you I said that's right I begin to think well what see everything begin to break away when it come to reasonings but when it come to that that hung it stayed there I was just about ready to say that I'll quit but when it got down to all the reasoning powers that broke away then it come to that eternal life that new birth what if it hadn't have been there what if it hadn't we wouldn't have know one another way we do now this church would have not been here like this the thousands and millions around the world but thank God it was there then when I thought what who am I anyhow who am I to question his majesty who am I to question the Creator to give me my very life here on Earth where did I get that baby who' give it to me not mine anyhow just loaned her to me for a while I said Satan get away from me I want over laid my hand on the baby I said God bless you sweet heart in a minute daddy will take you down put your own mommy's arms the angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in that morning I said Lord you give her to me you're taking her away though you slay me like job said yet I love you and I believe you if you send me to hell I love you anyhow I can't get away from that are you been intellectual it all broke away but you got to have personal relationship youve got to be born again that's the reason ministers give away great charges and things they say there's no such a thing as Divine Healing no such a thing as these things they've never been on that sacred ground I speaking this morning they know nothing of it how can they say that they're children of God and deny the word of God how can you do it denying the very holy spirit that bought you oh just remember Jesus humbled himself to death for you he was not fussy when they spit in his face he didn't spit back when they pulled his beard out he didn't pull it theirs well they slapped him from one side of the face the other he never slapped them he prayed for them walked on humbly he was an example of humility he was full of Faith why he know his words couldn't fail he so lived by by the word to he became the word oh God let me hold my both hands to God before this audience let me live like that let this word so become that me and this word's the same thing Let My Words Be this word let the meditation of my heart Let It Be in my Heart On My Mind tie his Commandments upon the post of my intelligence pie them upon the post of my heart heart let me just see him when Temptation Rises let me see Christ when things goes wrong let me just see him when I get ready and the enemy try to make me get angry let me see Jesus what would he do he was so much in the word that him and the word became the selfs same thing watch he didn't have to fuss he knew he and the Word was the same he know that he was God's word made manifest and it God command would finally conquer the world he know that his word he had Faith he know where he was at he didn't have to discuss and say here you could come over here devil said now look you can perform Miracles you know you got great faith you can perform Miracles I'll build you a bilding Twi size of or Roberts because people all if you thing you have do show them jump off this building here just go right down because it's written that the Angels bury the Earth at thir time Des for against the stone see he know he had power he know that he could do it he knew it was in him but he didn't want to use it till God told him to see he wanted to be God and him be the word all and he know that when he spoke anything that it was God's word and though heavens and earth pass away that word would someday conquer amen he wasn't fussy and steid he spoke just the words of God every word that come from his lips was God's anointed word wouldn't it be wonderful if we could say that my word and God's word is the same what I say he honors it because I do nothing till he tells me first there's your example there's a life worthy of the Gospel not those priests that were so educated and Polished and having all those great dignities and stand and make long prayers and devour Widow houses and devour the high seats and the and the congregation all these things that they was that wasn't a life worthy of the Gospel but he was worthy of the Gospel so much that God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him my word is he he is my word he and I are the same no watch this now he know that his word would finally conquer the word he knew where his word came from he knew it could never fail that's Reas he said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail he could say that that was a man who him and God's word become the same he said to them you are do this that he said who can condemn me of sin who can accuse me sin is unbelief if I by the Finger of God cast out Devils who does your sons cast them out by see it wasn't that so it had to be something else if I they said well we've cast out Devils he said if I do it with the Finger of God a Vindicated word of God then who does your sons cast him out by let you be the judge the people of his days and the people of of C made fun of him talked about him but he the humiliated him every way they could told him of all kinds of evil against him but he went on now I want to close a minute but saying this the people of this days are a bunch of neurotics the people of this day are a bunch of neurotics they are afraid to take the promises of God Church man Church organizations Church organizations are afraid to take the challenge of God's scripture for the this day they realize they realize that their modern conditions and their Social Gospel as they preach will not meet the challenge of this hour no more than Samson could meet it in his condition it took God and here's a program that promised him I'll get to that just in a minute I want to hold that word a minute though they call themselves Christian they adopt Creeds man-made Creeds to take the place of God's word so they can take the Creed because the man made it but they are afraid to lay their faith out there in the god that they claim that they love that's right and then you say that life worthy of the Gospel can't be though they be church members but that's not worthy of the Gospel no indeed the gospel Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow the Believers and when you deny that the follow the Believers how can you have a life no matter you might not never say a bad word you might keep all the Ten Commandments that won't have one thing to do with it it's still not worthy of the Gospel see it couldn't be those priests kept that and still was not worthy he said you're your father the devil who could lay a finger on one of that man one guilty Mark and they were stoned without Mercy holy man and Jesus said you're of your father the devil when the gospel came into though they call themselves Christians they love to hold to the creeds the Creeds the Creeds institutes and fulfills the thinking of the modern people of this day and a man that's going to be a success in this day has to go with the Modern Trend of thinking let me say that good and clear see a man if you're going to be a success you have to go with the modern thinking of this day they're going and say oh isn't he a darling isn't he wonderful he you just stay there so straight and he never keeps his over 15 minutes and our pastor don't always ball us out about these things shame on that Pastor any man that can stand up open and look up on the sin of this day and not cry out there's something wrong with that man he's not worthy of the Gospel that he claims to be preaching that's right so by doing so they make themselves excuses but saying now look my congregation a a man come here not long ago to a certain great church and he was writing a thesia and he said I'm writing on Divine Healing said brother brandham we love you in our denomination one of the greatest denominations one of the greatest of the nation or the world and he said uh we love you in this denomination he right here at the Jefferson Villa but said I come to find out about this Divine Healing he said there's only one fault that my church really finds so he said you associate around too many Pentecostals I said well you know that is right I said that's trueth you know I've always wanted an opportunity to get away from him I said I tell you what I'll come to your town you get your church to sponsor me oh he said they would that's what I thought thought I thought said you see my denomination won't stand for that that's as much excuse as I've married a wife or bought a yoka o I don't care how many doctor's degrees you've got and how much you're looked up to by your denomination that that sort of a Ministry is not worthy of the Gospel it's wrote in this book right any church member that'll s in with such stuff as that and call themselves a Christian and go out here and live and the women bobing their hair and wearing clothes that the Bible says for not to man carrying on the way they're doing now a farm of godlin taking drinks and smoking cigars and marrying several times and becoming deacons of the church and even pastors and so forth and the people have put up with such as that that sort of life is not worthy of the Gospel a woman that'll walk and get on the telephone and tattle and start fusses in the church and things like that that is a life worthy of the Gospel that we're R to represent any person that'll break up a church and start a feud between the people and things like that is not worthy of the Gospel that we preach exactly it's a form of godliness denying the power thereof the power of God that keeps you from such notice now they don't do it they just won't do it they have the excuse that their Church don't believe in it they went up with Jesus and say say to a man tonight speak to his heart and say I want you to go preach the full go my church doesn't stand for it Lord you excuse me if you will I've got a fine charge I I you know I'm a pastor one of the greatest churches in this city Lord oh we praise your name down there yes sir we sure do I can't do it the same excuse same thing so they don't come to the spiritual Feast of his promised Vindicated word did not Jesus say where the carcasses the Eagles will gather Eagles not buzzards now Eagles where the slop is and a and a a carrying then the buzzers GA but where the fresh clean meat is the Eagles are gathered certainly for the word Eagle Food they'll gather so they don't come to the spiritual Feast that they're invited to do you believe that God has given America an invitation the last 15 years to a great Revival to a spiritual Feast did they come no sir no sir then to reject to come is that life worthy of the Gospel though they call themselves that when a man come to me not long ago and sit at a table and said brother brandom I want to reach across the table a great man I want to take hold of your hand I love you I was in a church and heard him preaching said I love you I believe you're a God servant I said thank you doctor I love you too he said I want to tell you how much I love you as a brother and said you see My Little Queen sitting here my wife you remember her I said I do said the doctor give her two weeks to live with pyom cancer and you come to the city and you prayed for her and looked up and saw a vision and looked back and told me thus sayith the Lord she'll be healed great spot in her back sunk in like that looked like a great big uh like the uh part of a woman's breast pulled inwardly in her back right on her spine there's not even a spot of it today said there sets my queen a living today that how can I do anything but love you for praying that prayer of faith how can I keep from bleeding you to be a servant of Lord when you saw me and told just exactly what would happen he said now I've got something for you brother Brandon he said I belong to the greatest Pentecostal League there is I said yes sure I know that he said I talked with the brother not long ago and they told me to get in contact with you and tell you that it was a shame that you took that god-given Ministry to a bunch of people off the river around like that I said that right said yes said God sent that Ministry to hit the nerve spots the big spot the highlights I seen the devil talking right then I thought yeah jumped out off this mountain and show you know off this building see I thought this lead him out a little far my old mother used to say give the cow enough rope she'll hang her own celf I said is that right yes said it's a shame but what you do said what are you today you can hardly buy yourself a meal and said look at Oral Roberts them stepped in and got out there with the 100th of the ministry you got look what they go I said yeah that's right see and he said my group will take you we'll take you right in as as one of our Brethren they'll all give you the right hand of fellowship and we'll Charter a plane and give you a wages of 500 a week or more if you want it and we'll send you to every major city in the country this happened right in Phoenix Arizona right across the table and he said and we'll pay your said then let the world the outside world let the dignitaries the big guys the up and up so you're always talking about the down and out they got the up and outs so let them see the hand of the Lord and that take my wife long and others can prove that those things that you say comes to pass I said yes sir that' be great I see the man in the position of a dld d a writer of Books see doctor of literature fine writer fine man see he didn't know the scripture did you know that angel that performed them kind of works never did go to Sodom he stayed with the called out group Abraham you just didn't know I just let him alone just sat there a little bit I just wanted to see what the catch was now I said well uh what would I have to do said well brother brand just the only thing they said we discussed it a few things little petty things that you teach it you just lay them aside I said for instance what brother all he said you're baptism you know you know you kind of baptized like the oness something like that said little things like that I said oh I went ahead and he said the initial evidence women preachers and just a few little things like that I said uhhuh I said you know I'm surpris that one servant of God would ask another servant of God after paying the tribute to me you did and calling me a prophet and knowing that the word of the lord of the revelation of the word comes to the prophet and you turn around Dr Pope and don't speak of your good intelligence and would say and ask one servant of God you asked another servant of God to compromise on the thing that live means more to him in life itself I said no sir brother fol by no means what I do it no sir what is it there's a grain of eternal life live or die whether you're a great guy or not a great guy praise God where he finished right there with the Temptation from that brother to compromise a little bit to have the big meetings and all that I sit there and think I'm so glad that that grain of eternal life held amen we're the benefactors of that if we could go uh uh back to the questions there they are a Christian cannot be a Christian until what oh actually before we get there I want to I want to go to one uh little spot here on page 23 if we can turn to page 23 I just want to highlight this cuzz it stood out to me brother man was talking about his meetings in Mexico and when the little woman with the dead baby was trying to get in and they had to prevent her from coming and all of a sudden he saw the vision and he saw a vision of a laughing uh baby and he told Billy Paul to let her in and so she come and he was going to pray for her but I love the way that he prays uh uh paragraph 117 on page 23 so we opened up the crowd like that and brought her through here she come falling on her knees with the prayer beads in her hand I said and I said get up I said heavenly father now I don't know what you're going to do I don't know whether you just want me to satisfy the Wind by praying for the baby or what I said I lay my hands upon the little baby in the name of the Lord Jesus just the same thing as I did to brother wayy laying there on the floor dead the other day and the blanket kicked and that little baby started screaming and it was to his life but I love his attitude and his approach he saw a vision of a laughing baby and brought the woman up and then he said Lord I don't know what you're going to do I just love that humility I love that honesty I love that raw reality where he didn't have to prove anything or show anything all he knows is he saw a baby he doesn't know is this the baby is this or God what do you want me to do you just want me to appease her he doesn't already have it figured out all he does is walk by faith and that's the way I want to walk I don't want to have to have it all figured out I just want to take each step as he leads me along the way amen when we go to the the question now a Christian cannot be a Christian until what let's go to paragraph 129 over on page 25 at the bottom of page 25 paragraph 129 brother bam set down he's going to set down a principle that's going to be really important to the rest of this that we listen to said a Christian is not a tool or some kind of a mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime that's right a Christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organization moving a Christian that is not a Christian a Christian is to be Christlike so start right there a Christian is to be Christlike so a Christian doesn't mean to be part of a Christian group or a Christian organization or a Christian work so to be part of a group cannot make you a Christian so to be a Christian you have to be Christlike amen and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man and the life of Christ in him then it produces the life that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did what am I talking about personal relationship to Christ what is it is your life worthy of the Gospel so he says now you cannot be a Christian just to be part of the organization or part of the group though it's a Christian group so you cannot be Christian by label and you cannot be Christian by joining what's Christian you can only be be Christian by being Christlike but you cannot be Christlike by being taught how to be Christlike you cannot be Christlike by following rules following orders uh being instructed and when somebody does this then you answer this way that doesn't make you Christlike you can only be Christlike if the Life of Christ is born inside of you and that's the only way you can be a Christian is for the Life of Christ is to have the new birth The Life of Christ Living inside of you and that's what brother bham calls personal relationship to Christ in the token message he said it's you and Christ as persons together amen let's turn the page uh no we'll leave it at that we'll go to the next question there's some more of this that we'll pick up as we go on the next question is what will produce relationship with God let's go to paragraph 137 and I'm going to take the second half of 137 it's actually at the top of page 27 so we're going to begin right at the top of page uh 27 but there is the kind of excuse that people may say I'm a presbyterian we don't believe in that I'm a Baptist we don't believe in such stuff well I'm a Lutheran well that don't have anything to do with it that don't mean you're a Christian that means that you belong to a bunch of people that's organized and you belong to the Lutheran Lodge and the Baptist Lodge and the Pentecostal Lodge there's no such thing excuse me it's a Pentecostal Church there is no such thing as a Baptist Church it's a Baptist Lodge a Pentecostal Lodge a presbyterian Lodge I just want to share a testimony with you on that really quickly I was listening to this or something just like this I don't know if it's this exact section but it was where brother Brenham was calling the church's lodges and IID first come to the message I was I was a new convert new believer in the message and and I'll tell you how long it was ago it was I was away for factory training and I was up in Eerie Pennsylvania and they were they put us in a hotel and every day they'd pick us up in a 15 passenger van and they would take us to the factory for factory training well on the ride back and forth I had a Walkman radio with earbuds does anybody remember what a Walkman radio you put doublea batteries in it you can put a cassette tape in it and and you were the coolest thing in school if you had one of those some of you guys will see one in the museum one day or something but but I had one of those Walkman radios and I had my headphones on and I was sitting all the way back up against the window with my head lean the window and I was was listening to brother bam say something exactly like this I don't know if this section of tape or not and I had a thought in my heart I don't know about that because I grew up in church Realms and was in church all of my life and it was a little bit of a strong statement for me coming out of the Pentecostal church and as soon as I thought that we drove by and there was a Sign by the road that said the Manchester Presbyterian Lodge yeah can you imagine what reaction I had I said forgive me Lord I believe it now and when we first come to the message God did so many things like that for us and when I read through this it just reminded me of that and I wanted to share that with you god is so mindful of his children amen amen then it goes on he says but there's only one church and there's only one way you can get into it and that's by birth so you can't join it friends it's by birth you're born into the Church of Jesus Christ and a member of his body of the spiritual delegation of heaven then the signs that Christ is with you lives through you Christians oh you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a Son of God you must become relation to God he must be your father in order for you to be a son and that only his sons and daughters are saved not the members of a church but Sons and Daughters there's only one thing that will produce that that's the new birth the new birth is the only thing that will produce relationship to God that's right sons and daughters then when this takes place then men here's the question I want to get to you the man says what what do we do then after we're born again so many asked me that question what should I do then brother brandom if you're born again your entire nature is changed you are dead to the things that you once thought well you say brother benam when I joined a church I got that well then when God said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he still heals the sick he shows Visions but brother brenon my church now you're not born again what's he saying if you reject the word of God because of whatever Church tradition or whatever idea the minute you reject the word of God it proves you're not born again amen CU this all just blows up the whole idea of being born again from denominational world the denomination world thinks that if you make a confession out of your mouth or you come to an altar you shake a hand or you join the church that you're born again no you're only born again when that seed of God on the inside comes in contact with the Living Word Jesus Christ and he quickens that seed to life and he said you can only have relationship with God if you're a son or daughter of God not a member of a church so what makes you a son or daughter of God that you are offspring of God separated of God waiting to come back in contact with your father and what is the new birth it's Jesus Christ revealed personally to you where you're awakened to who you actually are and that seed comes to life and then you know that you're a Son of God because that's the only thing that can bring relationship to God is when you know you're a child of God not a member of a church so these things brother bram's teaching us is so vital and so important that you must in order to have a relationship you must be sons and daughters and only sons and daughters are born again they're the only ones who can be born again because it's a spiritual birth from the seed that's in the soul praise be to almighty God amen so you can only have relationship and you can only be a Christian if the Life of Christ lives inside of you and you can only have relationship with God is you have to be relation to him you hear how brother Rim said that you must be relation to him that means we must be related to have relationship so you can't teach that friends that's not teaching people how to meditate that's not teaching people how to say nice things are come to prayer meetings and that's that's not what builds relationship in order to build a relationship you have to actually be relation and he has to be your father and you have to be a son and that's how you have a relationship right not by teaching people how to say prayers or have devotion time we're not we don't we believe we should have devotion time we should believe we should spend time with them we believe should we further our relationship but you can only have a relationship if he's your father and you're his son and you're actually related yeah that's what the prophet is teaching us this message is so different than denominational teaching amen this is the reality the next question what is one thing to know that you're a Christian let's go to page 143 or I'm sorry paragraph 143 on page 28 what is one thing to know that you're a Christian you remember remember you can't be a Christian until the Life of Christ comes in you and lives through you all right when so what is one thing to know that you're a Christian when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the New Birth you will believe and do everything that God says in his word for you to do and everything that the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit you say will I speak with tongues you might do that and you might not well I shout you might do that and you might not but there's one sure thing you'll do you'll bear the Fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace Faith longsuffering meekness gentleness patience your temper will not be oh just remember when you got that that poisons the holy spirit away from you when you get to a place that you want to fuss with everybody you come along to there's something wrong when you get to a place where your minister will read from the Bible that it's wrong to do a certain thing and you just remember when you react remember there's no Christianity there at all that's Now by their fruits you shall know them that's what Jesus said see if it's the word and God said so that spirit in you will cope with the word every time because genuine Holy Spirit Will cope with the word because the word is life and spirit Jes Jesus said my words are life and if you've got eternal life and he's the word how can the word deny the word what kind of a person would you make God that's one thing to know that you're a Christian when you can fully agree upon every word of God Amen keep reading top of page 29 and you find yourself in love with your enemies somebody say well he's nothing but a Holy Roller and you start to get be careful be careful but when you really find yourself that you love him regardless of what they do you still love them then you begin to find and your patience gets from about that long till you just don't have no end anybody just keeps saying things about you well I don't care what you say don't get stirred up if you get stirred up you better go pray first before you talk to them again uh let's jump over to uh paragraph 154 on page 30 says now could you imagine imagine that a man with a life that would say to believe in Divine Healing that something for the birds that was back in years ago there's no such a thing today is that a life worthy of the Gospel that Christ was wounded for our transgressions and when his stripes we are healed you say but I'm a deacon I don't care you might be a bishop let's skip one paragraph and go down one more says that word is the truth right and the spirit of God will recognize his own writing he identified by his writing it speaks of him and you're identified by believing it and it gives you your credentials of identification so how do you get your credentials of identification not by what system you're joined to or what church you attend but by believing his word by believing all of his word and the word for our day when it's presented to us that gives us our credentials of identification amen praise God now when we go back and brother bam says there's one thing that you'll do for sure you will bear the fruit of the spirit then he says you'll love your enemy and then he says you'll have patience and you won't fuss and he goes into all this we'll read some of that a little bit later what brother brandom is not telling us he's not saying that you know you'll have massive control over your human nature and you'll bite your tongue and you won't say and you'll be you'll conform to a code of ethics where you won't be impatient and you'll you no he said that's a natural outcropping of having Jesus Christ's life inside of you it's not an effort it's not a put on it's not peacock feathers and a crow it's the actual you'll bear the fruit of the spirit not because you were taught to Bear the fruit of the spirit you'll bear the fruit of the spirit because that's the life of Christ he he'll explain that here in a little bit we'll get into that let's go to our next question now what creates an atmosphere around us page 29 paragraph 150 he says now don't fuss see temper breeds temper first thing you know you're grieving the holy spirit away from you you'll be fussing back then the Holy Spirit takes its flight temper breeds temper and love breeds love be full of love Jesus said this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another that's the fruit of the Holy Spirit love and did you know you're a little Creator yourself you you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why just that loving type of person have you seen that just as kind they you like to be around them they create that Atmosphere by the life they live by the way they talk their conversation then you've seen those that every time you shun them all time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there he's in here now he's going to talk about this man all they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around that see they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the thing that you think on and the things that you do the actions and the thing you talk about creates an atmosphere so what creates that atmosphere around us the things that we're feeding on the things that the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere well if I want the atmosphere of Christ about me what should I be thinking on and what should I be looking at and what I should I be talking about praise God a amen all right I just want to look at uh two more things that weren't in the questions if you go back to uh paragraph 120 just flip back with me paragraph 120 at the top of page 24 paragraph 24 or page 24 paragraph 120 they can't understand how a simple message a simple people to reject a thing like that would cause them to go into chaos paragraph 26 on page 25 now think of this as simple people God made it so simple how could Ahab how could Jezebel how could those people who thought that Elijah was a witch thought he was a spiritualist even Ahab said here is he the one that's caused all this trouble to Israel he said you're the one that's troubled Israel how could the nation think that to reject the message of a fuzzy faed man like that no Priestly garments on and so forth would be the condemnation of it how could Egypt the rule the world world pharaohs and its class and dignity the world has never come to that place again in science and so forth how could they think to reject an old prophet of 80 years old with Whiskers hanging down gray hair stomping out of their a fugitive and come out there with a message you'll either let them go or God will destroy the nation how could Pharaoh you obey me Pharaoh Pharaoh said obey oh obey oh him pharaoh and an old man some old crank they thought turn a guy down like that destroy a nation but it did oh my so what did Destruction come for why did why why did judgment and Destruction come because they turned down the simple message being carried by simple people because they rejected their day of visitation and they rejected the invitation to the spiritual Feast because it came in a simple way by simple people let's go to paragraph 157 on page 31 now let's watch look at Jesus just for a minute he was your example so if we ever want an example on life God gave us one when he came and lived in flesh I hope you're not getting too tired look let's look at Jesus just a minute he was our example said for I've given you an example that you should do to others as I have done to you now watch when he come into the world when there was more as much unbelief in the world right then as there ever was it didn't even slow him up he went right on preaching just the same and healing just the same never bothered him there was critics the man was criticized from the time he was a baby until he died on the cross did it stop him no sir what was his goal always do that always do that which the father has written always do which pleased him look at Jesus talk about us humbling ourselves when God himself became a baby instead of coming in a little crib somewhere in a decent home was born out there over a manure Pile in a stable amongst balling calves they wrapped him in swaddling clothes was off the neck of a yoke of an ox the poorest of the poorest and yet the CB of heavens and earth one cold rainy night they said Master we'll go home with you he said the foxes has holes and the birds has Nest but I don't even have a place to lay my head god Jehovah humbled himself and became a man represented in sinful flesh to redeem you and me who are we then he was our example who am I nothing I think this is so important because brother benam says he was our example but to be a Christian what life is supposed to live in US that same life so that example life we can only live by the same life that was in him if it's in us that's the only way that we can live that example life we can't do it of our own effort and our own willpower and our own trying it actually takes the Life of Christ that lived it the first time to come and live it in us this time that's the only way we can be a Christian is to have that Life of Christ in us and then we have this this thought who am I if Christ can humble himself that way if he can be criticized if he can be rejected if he can have no place and he keeps doing the he keeps obeying the word and he keeps doing the will of the father then what's my excuse who am I paragraph 162 I was telling someone this afternoon in a little meeting I said every son that's born of God has to be tried first chastened I remember when I had mine or my greatest hour when a man is born I'm sorry when I had remember when I had mine or my greatest ER yes when a man is born again there's a little spot like the size of his fingernail that God injects into him system and it falls into his heart and their anchors then Satan makes him prove it and if that ain't there you're gone lock in on that now brother B says something comes into you the Life of Christ comes into you at the new birth and he then he says and Satan makes you prove that so let's not get discouraged when Satan starts making us prove it but listen what he says if that ain't there you're gone we will never stand the proving time or the testing time unless the actual life of Christ is in US amen no human life can make it amen no human life can make it then he starts to talk about his testing time and he starts to go back to the death of his brother the death of his father and the trial that that brought on him because he's preaching Divine Healing he's he's preaching God is great God's A Healer and he's being rejected all over but he's preaching the gospel and now his brother dies his father dies in his arms his wife dies and then he gets a call to the hospital that his baby's dying and brother M starts to share with us that he's crying out to God and let's go to page 33 and pick it up there he said he paragraph 171 he just pulled down the curtain as if to say shut up I don't want to hear you at all he wouldn't even talk to me then if he wouldn't talk to me it was Satan's time he said I thought you said he was a good God that's all this you're hollering about you're just a boy look around over the city every girl every boy you ever associated with think you've lost your mind you have now he couldn't tell me there's no God cuz I had already seen it but he told me he didn't care for me said all night long all day long I said that to god what have I done show me Lord don't let the innocent have to suffer for me if I done wrong I didn't know he was trying me but every son that comes to God has got to be tried amen I just want to bring this to your attention the question is what is being tried what's really being tried what's being tried is your sonship yeah what is your sunship it's his life in you amen so what is really being tested and tried in our lives friends in our darkest hour it's actually Christ being tried because it's our sunship being tried amen and only the Life of Christ will will make it through the trial amen it's not your flesh being tried because your flesh will fail it's not your Humanity it's not you as a human being that's not being tested because that will fail hands down but what's being tested is that every son that comes to God must be chasen and tested so what's he testing our sunship in only that relationship to God only Christ's life only his life in us will make it through the test amen that's what the prophet's teaching us this is not a grit your teeth and do better message this is a surrender and let his life flow through US message cuz we can't do it ourselves friends should we try yeah we should try but all our trying going to Mountain failures we should do our part but without his life we'll never make it let's go to the top of P page 34 said then I began to listen to him that's reasoning I thought that's right he he said he can tell he don't have to speak the word just look to your baby and it would live and I said that's right brother B said now this Satan's is working on his reasoning and his human reasoning is agreeing with the devil right that's right and as much as you've done for him and yet that's what he does for you I said that's right I begin to think well what see everything begin to break away when it come to reasonings so he was as a human being in his reasoning mind he was falling apart he was losing faith he was he was about ready to walk away but then he says but then but when it come to that see how that's capitalized in your book that's the Eternal part heart when it come to that that hung it stayed there I was just about ready to say then I'll quit but when it got down to all the reasoning Powers had broke away then it come to down to that eternal life that new birth what if it hadn't been there you tell me what would have happened if hadn't been there he would have collapsed under that trial the only thing that got him through the trial was the life of Jesus Christ on the inside of him what if it hadn't what if it hadn't have we wouldn't have known one another the way we do now this church would not be here like this the thousands and millions around the world but thank God it was there then when I thought what who am I anyhow who am I to question his majesty who am I to question the Creator that give me my very life here on Earth where did I get that baby who give it to me not mine anyhow he just lered to me for a while I said Satan you get away from me I want went over I laid my hands on the baby I said God bless you sweetheart in a minute daddy will take you down and put you on mommy's arms the angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in the morning I said Lord you give her to me you're taking her away though you slay me like job said yet I love you and I believe you if you send me to hell I'll love you anyhow I can't get away from that there you are just if just been intellectual it had all broke away but you got to have personal relation relationship you've got to be born again listen if it had just been teaching and instruction from a church on how to handle trials and who God is and you're nobody any if it had just been instruction it would have fallen away the only thing that held was that new born New Birth Born Again life on the inside that's the only thing that held praise God and it's the only only thing that'll hold you and I friends and I thank God for it I would have been discouraged and walked away a long time ago if there wasn't something more than intellectual if there wasn't something more than my flesh and my willpower and my strength and good teaching there had to been something more than all of that friends because there Comes A Time all the good teaching that you got there's a there's a there's a master Reasoner that can out reason all of your instruction amen but there's something deeper than reasoning and deeper than the mind and it's God's life amen last thing I would like to read to you at the bottom of page 36 if you can turn to paragraph 190 at the bottom of page 36 said I want to hold that word a minute though they call themselves Christian they adopt Creeds man-made Creeds to take the place of God's word so they can take the Creed because the man M because man made it but they're afraid to lay their faith out there in in the god that they claim that they love that's right and when you say that the life then you say that that life is worthy of the Gospel can't be though they be church members but that's not worthy of the Gospel no indeedy the gospel Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow the Believers and when you deny that to follow the Believers how can you have a life no matter listen you might not never say a bad word you might keep all the Ten Commandments that won't have that won't have one thing to do with it it's still not worthy of the Gospel see it couldn't be those priests kept that and still was not worthy he said you are of your father the devil who could lay a finger on one of them men one guilty Mark and they were stoned without Mercy holy men and Jesus said you're of your father the devil when the gospel came into it so you find out friends it's not just keeping the Commandments right because the priest kept the Commandments it's got to be a life on the inside if you would turn with me in your Bibles I want to read one scripture as the musicians come and as brother Blake comes let's turn to Matthew n Matthew 19 Matthew 19:20 this is the story of the Rich Young Ruler who come to Jesus and wanted to know what good works he must do to inherit a eternal life and in verse 20 Jesus says it says the young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet so he asked Jesus what must I do to inherit eternal life he said you know the Commandments honor thy father and mother do this do this keep the Commandments and this young man says all of these have I kept from my youth up yet what do I lack Jesus said unto him if thou wil be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shal have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions and we find though this man had kept all the Commandments he had an excuse that he couldn't he couldn't heed the invitation what did we just read in the Bible Jesus gave him an invitation sell all that you have and come and follow me that was his visitation that was his invitation that was his opportunity and when he had an excuse and he walked away we find that man in Hell lifting up his eyes he had kept all the Commandments but keeping the Commandments is not enough it's got to be Christ's life in us it's got to be a born again experience and that life in us well how do you know you're a Christian every word that he wrote and everything that he said something in you says Amen to it not from the mind but something deeper says Amen to it and then begins to produce that life amen let's all Stand Together say thank you Lord having a life worthy of the Gospel is not something that you and I can do on our own that's right having a life worthy of the Gospel is being able to accept the invitation and that comes by pre the predestinated will of God and I'm so thankful when the IM ation come my way there was something deeper than my intellect cuz my intellect was screaming no but something inside of me said that sounds true God be praised amen than oh teach me thy way oh [Music] Lord and I I will walk in th Tru unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name teach me thy [Music] way oh oh [Music] Lord and teach me

we cannot of our own Merit or strength or wisdom or intellect ever stand the testings that must come to a son or a daughter God I'm so thankful God that you've provided something more Lord you haven't required that we just become perfect on our own and that we just overcome in our own strength but you provided your own life and you shared it with us Lord you planted yourself in our hearts Lord
