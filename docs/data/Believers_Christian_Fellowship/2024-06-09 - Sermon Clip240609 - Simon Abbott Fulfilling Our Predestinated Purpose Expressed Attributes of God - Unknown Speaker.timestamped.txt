[0:00] so I want you to I want you to get this
[0:02] home you would not misquote like Satan
[0:05] did in the beginning Thou shalt not
[0:07] surely die is there anybody in here that
[0:09] is ever tempted to add one word or take
[0:11] one word from
[0:12] it then why don't we live the
[0:16] life because you are the word of God
[0:20] expressed see on one hand we we've got
[0:22] such respect for this that we would
[0:25] never misrepresent or misquote this and
[0:28] yet he's saying that this is
[0:31] you so we've got to be so careful that
[0:34] day by day every day that we live if no
[0:36] one's watching you and you're going down
[0:38] the 75 home and you know you're doing 80
[0:40] when you're supposed to do 70 he's
[0:42] watching you someone's watching you
[0:44] somewhere what is it this level of
[0:47] responsibility it's this sincerity that
[0:49] we have to come to you would not
[0:52] misrepresent the scriptures don't
[0:54] misrepresent your life because your life
[0:57] is the scripture amen you are the
[1:00] written Epistles of God read of all men
[1:04] come
[1:05] on you have been chosen to display this
[1:09] message and everything around the
[1:12] message to the world you listen you've
[1:16] been chosen before the foundation of the
[1:18] world to hold the sword of the Lord amen
[1:22] think of it the word and he shaped us
[1:25] just like he shaped brother mam he
[1:27] shaped each one of us in such a way that
[1:29] we are so so we feel we are just so
[1:33] seems like we're battered you know at
[1:35] the end of the day my old nana I mean
[1:38] Anna used to love cooking jam tarts for
[1:40] me they were the best but you know when
[1:43] she'd been making the old bow to get it
[1:45] into shape she'd give it a good slapping
[1:47] you know what I mean if you want to get
[1:49] it into shape you've got to give it a
[1:50] slap you know what I mean and that's
[1:53] kind of how it is we've been shaped we
[1:55] aren't just here like that we've been
[1:57] shaped not only by our parents
[2:00] we've been shaped by all those
[2:02] Generations back everything so listen we
[2:05] have to listen carefully we have to
[2:07] manifest God so perfectly to the full
[2:11] capacity in this day that you have got
[2:13] to be shaped to
[2:15] Perfection Perfection does not mean we
[2:17] look like some kind of sweet guy on the
[2:20] outside Perfection means your character
