========================================

and i just want to [Applause] to be please in his presence found in his likeness i just want to please to hear him say well done please to hear him say well done praise the lord it's good to see you all especially those who haven't been here for a while does my heart good to see you all god bless you amen what a what a wonderful time to be together what a wonderful thing to do to come together and worship god together amen we love him for his steadfastness we love him for his faithfulness we love him for his keeping power because if it wasn't for him none of this would be possible he's the one who's kept us and brought us together and we thank him for that so say god bless you it's a good morning to serve the lord they're all good mornings to serve alone let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to proverbs chapter 16. proverbs chapter 16. it's good to see all who were able to make it out and praise the lord it's wonderful to see everybody together may the lord just be magnified and glorified and lifted up and maybe just feast from his hand today amen may he be the one who speaks and may we just receive from him in this time let's look at uh proverbs 16 32 proverbs 16 32 he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city i just want to emphasize that he that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh the city now if you think about that he that slowed the anger is better than the mighty he that rules his spirit than he that taketh the city i mean it's most small small tasks to take a city we're thinking about the day in which they lived in maybe even a walled city or a city and a man is able to scale the wall and overthrow the city and all of its defenses in all of its military might but the one who can control his own spirit is better than that man so this isn't a small statement this is a major statement i mean praise god let's turn over to proverbs 25 another verse of scripture proverbs 25 and verse 28 proverbs 25 and 28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls so if if a man can rule his own spirit he's better than one that the mighty and one that can take a city but man who can't rule his own spirit is like a wall like a city with no broken down with no walls no defenses you're overcome by everything and let's just bow our heads and ask the lord to bless us lord jesus we thank you we thank you god that we're able to gather in like this we're so thankful lord that our brothers and sisters are here this the older ones among us who've paved the way who have paid the price who have made sacrifices for the rest of this assembly we're so thankful they're here among us lord this morning what a blessing it is how it makes my heart lord warm to see them hear and know god that you've provided lord and you've used them as instruments in your hand to make a way for us and we're here together to worship your name to glorify you lord that you might be high and lifted up and we're here to feed from your hand lord things that we have need of in this hour we pray you would just speak to us lord and that you would lead and guide us into all truth for your name's sake in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated man i just want to say it's been it's been a bit of a task to figure out how many we can fit and how to arrange the seats and all of these things and i just want to give a big thank you to the trustees and the deacons who have been working hard to make sure we're doing what we're supposed to do but we can get as many people together as possible and i thank them for that they're constantly looking and evaluating and after service is thinking about can we do this can we change that what can we do and i just want to say i appreciate them and then brother brian balog was here late last night setting up chairs in the fellowship hall just in case we needed room for overflow and he was here until 11 something doing that so god bless these men amen we appreciate them and appreciate everyone who will step up and take their place and do what they can you know so we appreciate that i just want to say as we read these scriptures this was unusual this wasn't the direction i was intending to go in but i i had woke up uh yesterday morning i believe it was saturday morning and before i even opened my mind before i even opened my eyes that first scripture come to my mind you know he that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh the city which was strange i had first thought in my mind hadn't even opened my eyes yet there was no good morning there was no light to hit my eyes but i just come awake and that was there and then the next thought that god flooded into my mind was gethsemane and all of a sudden these two parts of scripture come together for gethsemane and this morning i'd like to preach on the victory of gethsemane the victory of death in gethsemane and just this reminds you i'll just read through these verses again before we move on it says he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city proverbs 25 28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls so we want to talk about this in the context of gethsemane and brother branham says in the message desperations from 1963 says our dear lord jesus himself and the world's greatest battleground gethsemane so he he brother branham when he starts talking about jesus in gethsemane he says this was the world's greatest battleground i mean it's amazing the way he looks at this and and he calls gethsemane the world's greatest battleground there was a battle taking place something was going on in gethsemane that was the world's greatest battleground amen something was taking place in gethsemane that affects you and i amen the the ability for us to be redeemed for the victory that we would have now amen there was something there was a victory taking place in the world's greatest battleground in gethsemane that has paved the way for you and i he said our dear lord jesus himself and the world's greatest battleground gethsemane he cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on earth was his beloved disciples what he wanted to do so jesus is now in a battle but the the enemy he's in a battle with isn't so much a physical enemies in front of amen he's now battling his own will and his own desires will he amen will he take the path god has asked him to take or will he stay on earth with his disciples and this is amazing there's some things brother branham says and and don't ask me to explain it i can't explain it i don't understand but there's some things that brother branham says and he says jesus didn't have to go to calvary he chose to he wasn't forced but at some point he had to make a choice and he had to wrestle it out with himself in gethsemane knowing full well what he was facing knowing what was coming amen and he had to make a choice jesus christ had to make a choice and he made it in gethsemane would he die would he be brutally tortured would he be punished would he be separated or would he stay on earth with his disciples he could make that choice and i don't understand that we know god's got a plan from before the foundation of the world but he set it up on free moral agency and he had a choice he could go this path or he could go that path it was his choice amen would he would he should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do so brother man was telling us what he wanted as a human as a man there was a desire he wanted to stay with his disciples they didn't want to depart from his disciples he didn't want to be separated with them he wanted to stay with them but there was a greater desire than that desire and he wanted to please the father and so in gethsemane there's a war going on amen the war between the desire to stay with his disciples and the desire to please the father it's a great battleground name goes on to say but watch his humility as he humbled himself not my will but thine be done humbled himself to the word the promised word of the god of heaven amen let's look at gethsemane for a minute if we could turn to john 18. just we'll look at a few scriptures here concerning gethsemane and move on because the real thing that hits me with impact in all of this is that we have to have gethsemane we ourselves have to pass through the garden of gethsemane and and as i've been meditating on this and thinking about it over the last little while i've been thinking you know we we may not just have one gethsemane in our lives we may have many we may have several gethsemanes in our lives amen but but there's got to come a time to dying out where we die out where we wrestle it out when we take our way or we take god's way and we got to battle it out we got to wrestle it out amen we've got to come to that place amen but there's many times we come to new trials all the time new hardships new difficulties and we battle it out all over again what will i do with this will i run from this trial or will i walk right into it there's many times when we go into a trial when we make a decision to stand on the word amen there's many times that we have a choice amen we can take an easier road and nobody will know but us nobody will know that we chose an easier path amen but the one god's asking us is to take a stand amen and take a harder path and many times we could take an easier path and we've got to wrestle it out in our own gethsemane which way will we go because god is not in the habit of forcing he set this up on free moral agency now he looks in john 18 john 18 verse 1 when i when i read i'll read this verse and then we'll talk about it when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the book sidron where where was a garden into which he entered and his disciples now in the other gospels in matthew and mark they named that garden gethsemane amen and luke that he said he goes into the garden and he and he plays out kind of what happens in the garden but john is always just a little different the book of john just always gives a little different insight amen it's always got something different and i always want to know what's different and why when i see that difference is why nobody else talked about the brook that he crossed nobody else named that he crossed the brook sidron nobody else talks about that they just talk about the garden and they talk about gethsemane so i looked up sidron and it's a greek word it's only used one time this is the only place that this word is used in the new testament and it means turbid it means turbid and i had to look that up because i have no idea what turbid means i don't even know if i'm pronouncing it right but it says not clear not clear or transparent because of stirred up sediment or the like clouded opaque obscure thick or dense as smoke or clouds and then getting down to the emotional side it says confused muddled disturbed and so when jesus was walking from the last supper at the last supper he makes a statement it says he was troubled amen and he and he testified and being troubled he testified one of you shall betray me so in the last supper he's with the he's with those that are dearest to him on earth and he's sharing a meal and he realizes amen this is the last he says i'll drink of the vine i'll eat of this no more will i drink of this till i drink it fresh with you and new with you in my father's kingdom he knows what's coming and he's at this time and he becomes troubled because there's going to be a betrayal and and he starts to move amen from that scene to change the scene and he's going to he's going to go to the garden of gethsemane but he's going to cross over a place called sidron he's going to cross over a place that's obscure it's muddled it's not clear amen and so many times we move into places that are obscure and unclear and muddled it's not super clear we're moving in places in our lives it's not like it's this or this it's we don't have a clue sometimes what choice to make it's unclear we don't even know what's happening to us or why it's happening we're moving through we've got to cross over amen this confused this model this unclear this cloudy place amen to move into the garden so now this is this is the path that he's walking and so we get it we get into the garden let's turn to matthew 26 and read about that there matthew 26 and 36 matthew 26 and 36 then cometh jesus with them into a place called gethsemane and saith unto disciples sit ye here will i go and pray yonder many of us know but gethsemane means the oil press and it was a they believe a grove of of olive trees amen and we know that olive oil comes from olive trees but you have to press it out you have to squeeze it out to get the oil out and so gethsemane means oil press it says see ye here will i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy i just want you to focus on this verse for a minute he began to be sorrowful and very heavy you know brother ram does some unique things when he talks about jesus christ then and like i said just a few minutes ago i won't be able to explain all this i can't explain it but i believe it the prophet said it but he said he was completely man and he was completely god it was god had created a tabernacle for himself to live and he created a body and this was the son of god a virgin born a sinless body no hybridization no sin in this body but yet that body was every bit man every bit man but he was brother ben said the god man because he was completely god and he said he makes some statements about this then i i don't i'm not going to be able to explain it to you but when you read this scripture you can see the humanity and for this morning i'd like to just focus a little bit on the humanity of jesus christ because he's called our brother is that right he's called our brother amen he is our brother amen he was jesus christ in the form of flesh amen exactly like we're in the form of flesh only without hybridization without any sin but yet he had emotions he had feelings he he had different things that he had to experience as a man just like we experienced them as a man amen and and so it's important to recognize that in verse 37 he says and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death carry ye here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt so when we look at this scripture you can see jesus is expressing his will he says father if it's possible let this cup pass from me but not my will he's saying that's what i want i want this cup to pass from me if there's another way amen and mark he says father you can do all things he prefaces it by saying father you can do all things amen you can do all things if you can let this pass for me let it pass but nevertheless not my will but thine and he's expressing that he has a will he has a will he has a desire he's sorrowful and very heavy and he wants to stay with his disciples and he's expressing his will lord if this cup can pass from me let it pass from me but if there's no other way then i want your will not my will so jesus was a man he was a man he was god he was the god man but he was a man and he's and he's struggling here so father if it'd be possible that this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou will and he cometh unto his disciples and finding them asleep and saith unto peter what would you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left him and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hours at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me so we're looking at jesus agony and his suffering here in the garden of gethsemane if we can turn to luke 22 together i want to pick up one verse there luke 22 and i want to read verse 44. 22 and 44 and being in agony he prayed more earnestly being in agony jesus christ was in agony this wasn't just a pretend trial just so you could see that there was a struggle at trial but he was really in agony and it says here he was being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground i've never been in that much agony have you he being in agony a real trial for the son of god not just pretend it wasn't a drama he wasn't dramatizing a trial he was in a trial he wasn't just it wasn't just going through the motion so we see he was agonizing as it was till sweat was as it were great drops of blood hitting the ground he was he was sorrowful and very heavy amen he was really struggling and he was struggling with his own will he was struggling with his own desire amen would i go god's way or or or is there another way and he's asking god three times is there another way is there another way is there another way because he wants there to be another way but he's willing if there's no other way then i'll go this way and that was the battle that he was facing brother brown says in the breach he says and john started crying because no one was worthy and no one could even look at the book oh it took a human being john wet because no one could do it and everything was lost and there came a voice from one of the elders standing in the midst of the four beasts and all the great host of heaven said don't weep john oh my the grace of god don't be don't be brokenhearted john don't weep for the lion of the tribe of judah the root and offspring of david he has prevailed prevail means wrestle with and overcome oh my in the garden of gethsemane when his blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming the lion the root of the david was has prevailed has overcome this word vervail means to wrestle with and overcome what did he do in the garden of gethsemane he wrestled with and overcome but the question is what was he overcoming what was he overcoming we know that he had already taken the test in the in the wilderness amen after he was already filled with the holy ghost led of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil and he already passed the test amen that they had failed in the garden of eden the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life amen and he was tempted with all of these things and these were outside temptations satan placing a temptation on him to get him amen to lust and crave for the things of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and he passed everyone by the word he said it is written it is written it is written and get thee behind me satan he kept taking the word to defeat the temptation so he already had overcome the same kind of temptation that he fell by but now he's got to come to the garden of gethsemane to be tempted again this is amazing he's already passed through the wilderness temptation now he's in gethsemane there he overcome the devil he overcame temptation and then he overcame lust but now he's battling it out again but we have no dialogue with the devil in the garden again we have no dialogue with the devil we have a man wrestling with himself you know many of us have been through tests and been through trials and god brings us to places where you have to face things down by the word and there's something coming contrary to the word and we've got to bring the word to face it off and this thing's trying to get us to take the wrong path amen and we bring the word and bring the word and bring the word amen but there's some trials that are a little different than those trials and there's some trials that you face all alone because jesus friends did not even understand what he was going through he had nobody to stand with him he had nobody that would wait with him one hour and he's in agony he's in turmoil amen and he's not fighting an outside force he's fighting his own humanity and he's doing it all alone he's in the night how many times have you had a all by yourself in the night prayer meeting with god crying out to god in the in agony amen because there's something happening that we don't want to happen there's something we're going through that we don't want to go through there's something happening in our lives and we're saying father can i bypass father is there another way father can this cup pass from me and sometimes your closest friends don't understand what you're going through you can't call them up and pray for me because they don't understand it it doesn't make sense to them it's your own private trial it's your own private gethsemane there's times if you're married there's times your spouse will not understand what you're going through right there and it can be so discouraging but god set it up that way because he wants you he doesn't want the group amen he wants you and jesus is now he's struggling amen this is what he's he's not struggling with an attack on the word he's not struggling with a false interpretation of the word he's not struggling with a temptation to get him to lust and leave the word to take something else he's struggling with himself and when does he do this at the end of his ministry after he's grown after he's matured after he's increased in wisdom and underground wisdom and understanding and knowledge of god after all of this after he's been tested already after he's been tried after god's used him to manifest after all of that he comes to a gethsemane where now he's not wrestling with the devil he's wrestling with himself praise me to god things are getting more intense and they're going to continue to get more intense but i got a feeling we're all going to have gethsemanes to face we've had gethsemanes and we're going to half gethsemanes and jesus was so pressed in the oil press in gethsemane under that agony under that pressure under that press until it was pressing the blood out a sweat from his brow brother bam said he was under such distress amen the blood began to separate in his veins don't know even what that means but it began to pour it began to drop out of sweat from his brow his blood he was under so much press because the gethsemane is the oil pressed and brother bam said the blood represents the life amen and under that press what was happening the life was coming out he was pressed until the blood began to come out of sweat amen what was squeezing the life out it was the agony it was the it was the it was the the heaviness it was the sorrow that he was facing and when he was battling with himself and everything was clamping down on him it was bringing out the life and how do you get the fragrance out of a rose brother ram said you crush it and when you begin to crush it when you put the squeeze on it amen amen that thing that's trapped on the inside that somebody wants is a sweet perfume amen's got to be crushed amen to get the fragrance out not because there's no love for the rose but because they know that the rose is holding a fragrance and god knows that his bride each individual is holding within yourself a fragrance amen and he wants that sweet smelling savor amen and he's willing to put it into gethsemane to the press amen and under agony and under heaviness amen you have to say if god loves us he won't put us there he put his son there his only begotten son he stuck him right there not because he didn't love him but because he did love him and he trusted in him he had confidence in him he didn't put him there in the beginning of his ministry he didn't put him there as a 12 year old boy he didn't put him there when he started in the wedding in cana he put him there after he'd been tested tried proved stood on the word manifest the word and after that he put him in gethsemane and sometimes we think we get it all backwards we thought i mean we'll overcome the hard stuff now and then we move into the christian retirement plan you make all the investments up front you make the hard decisions you throw out the shorts and you quit cutting your hair and throw the makeup away and cut the cord through the cable tv and man have i sacrificed have i given up my life for the lord amen but that's exactly how you feel i've given it all up i fully surrendered amen and that was you just fighting amen with the attributes of unbelief that was just fighting with the attributes of unbelief and overcoming them by the word and kicking them out and having victory amen but that was just the beginning friends that's not what he i mean he that's not to the place he wants us yet he wants us to the place of full surrender so he can have full preeminence amen until we're willing to go by ourselves where nobody on this earth understands our misery and our sorrow and our trouble amen and there's no other place to go and it's dark and we've already crossed over the cloudiness and the muddled confusion and then we've come into a garden and now he's seemingly squeezing everything out of us what's he doing he's proving he's got confidence in you and he's showing that there's a life in there that can come out amen not in the beginning but at the end this bride has walked with the lord and she's grown amen she's learned she's endured she's taken the word amen but it wasn't the beginning it was the end of his ministry it was after he had overcome after he had accomplished what god had wanted the comments after he had manifest the god of heaven after he had stood on the word after all of that then he leads him to gethsemane brother bam says in the rising of the sun now notice this quickening power zoe bringing the word the mind that was in christ was in you then i'm trying to show you that when you when you raised when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quickened to life with him you are now quicker to life though then you were but an attribute in his thoughts but god had saw all in him at the finish see when god looked down upon the body the spirit of him the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane i'll just tell you i don't know how that works i can't i can't compute all that but i believe it another place in nicest ways said the anointing left him in the garden of gethsemane amen so now he's in the garden of gethsemane and something has lifted off of jesus christ something where he felt the presence of the lord where he had the anointing amen and that is now gone and now he's wrestling out his humanity the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which was human flesh if he'd have went up there as god he'd never died that kind of death can't kill god but he did have to do it so he had to die as a man as a man amen and that man was the flesh man of god it was god who was nailed to the cross but as a man not as a supernatural being but as a man he was nailed to that cross and as a man he was wrestling it out in gethsemane i want to if we could go back to matthew i want to slow down just a minute and go back to matthew chapter 4. if i'm not careful i'll just fly and i just want to take a little bit of time and just share this as it's been laying in my heart i feel like each week i get more inadequate to preach because god's dealing in a way that like laying in the bed before my eyes were open these thoughts come and i don't really know quite clearly what to do with them but i know it's god and i know it's something to preach and and then all of a sudden there's like a knowing in my heart i know what this means but i don't know how to explain it like i know i know what he's saying but i don't know how to say it and i don't know if that makes any sense to you or not but but there's something he's doing amen before i'm fully away and there's a knowing that comes with it but how to explain what he's dropped in the unspoken part i don't know how to explain it friends but i'm trusting that same one can drop the unspoken part in your heart this morning that you can catch amen what it is god wants us to catch in this hour amen this is deeper amen than just preaching what i'm trying to talk about is much deeper than preaching a sermon it's much deeper than sitting in a service amen it's much deeper than spending an hour and a half or two hours in the anointed preaching of the word it's deeper than that this is heart surgery amen where god is the one wielding the scalpel and he's the only one that knows how to cut you where you need to be cut and when he cuts he cuts exactly to the spot where the problem is remember you know we talked about uh wednesday the rich young ruler when he come to jesus he said what must i do to inherit eternal life he said you know the commandments keep this and keep that and do that he said all of these have i kept from my youth up and jesus the master heart surgeon amen he looks at him says one thing now lack us oh you know what that cut where nobody else could cut what jesus just said to him cut him so deep into the exact spot that needed to be cut out but he wouldn't stay under the scalpel of the master surgeon to have that thing cut out of him so that he could go free jesus offered him freedom and to the rich young ruler it looked like it looked like a burden it looked like bondage sell all that they have and follow after me sell all that i have and give to the poor and and see and before he said that after he said you know keep these commandments and do this and do that and he says all that i've done he says jesus looking at him loved him loved him and because he loved him he took his knife and he cut into the part of the heart amen that needed to be exposed and needed to be cut out that's his love amen and we get the wrong idea of god's love that somehow god's loving you know he's always going to make it nice and we're always going to have a good time and we're going to be surrounded by friends and have a lot of good time we're always going to have an exciting service that's not always the expression of his love but when he was expressing his love to that that young man amen he cut him deep and he cut him personal and he cut him he cut him in a place amen that his rabbi didn't know about [Applause] he cut him in a place that his mom and dad may not have known about but he got him in the spot that was holding him back he got him in the spot that was keeping him from fully being free amen with the things of god and god knows how to do that to us friends and that's his love expressed but he'll let a trial come and let hardship come he'll let something come and he'll cut you in the only he's the only one who knows that that's where it's at [Applause] i said before nobody can cut deep like god can cut deep and it makes you feel like you're dying i mean you feel like god you're killing me that means ever had that thought you're you're in a trial god's doing something there's no way around it you can't do anything about it it's just happening and you're saying god you are killing me you are literally killing me any and i could just see i mean just let me be fictitious for a moment dramatized he could say that's the point that's the point he's trying to get us to willfully die he's trying to get us to willfully surrender and willfully die and we keep wanting to live and he wants us to die [Applause] amen we want we want blessings and he has no problem getting blessings but we want blessings because blessings feel good amen he wants us to die so that the blessings can mean something [Applause] because blessings with no death are meaningless how many people in jesus ministry got the blessings but it meant nothing at the end of the day it meant nothing their soul was lost the blessings meant nothing god wants something more than to bless us amen he'll bless us no no doubt about it there's blessings coming in the new heavens and new earth there's blessings coming in the millennium there's lots of blessings coming but there's something he wants first and that's all of you what did jesus want he wanted all of that rich young ruler a hundred percent but jesus didn't want a hundred percent for any selfish reason because when jesus got a hundred percent that was freedom for the rich young ruler see freedom from bondage freedom from bondage was going to require a sacrifice on the part of the one going free and he didn't want to pay the price he didn't want to pay the price let's look at matthew 4 have we read matthew 4 yet we haven't read it praise the lord matthew 4 1 then was jesus led up to the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hungered so here jesus is on a 40-day fast and it says after his fast he was hungry mother said during a fast you're not hungry if god puts a fast on you you're not even hungry but after his fast after 40 days fast he was hungry and so the devil comes to him and starts tempting him with his hunger says turn these stones into into bread but let's turn over to luke want to look at another scripture and there's something i want to draw out of these luke 4 and 13. luke 4 and 13. and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season and jesus returned in the power of the spirit unto galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all so in this initial test in this initial trial he was weak in the flesh we agree he was weak in the flesh but he come out of it strong in the spirit we read that jesus returning in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out of fame of him through all the region why was there so much fame because of the demonstrations of the spirit he was strong in the spirit through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all oh he was he was teaching he was being glorified at all a fame was going out he went up strong in the spirit he was weak in the flesh and his temptation but he was strong in the spirit but when we get to gethsemane brother branham says the spirit leaves him in gethsemane and he had just eaten with his disciples so now he's not weak in the flesh he's weak in the spirit this is a totally different kind of trial there he's strong in the spirit weak in the flesh amen and he overcomes the temptations to the flesh by the word hey but now he's going he just ate a meal with his disciples now he's going into the garden to pray he's not weak in the flesh it's not a 40-day fast amen he's got he's got friends that were there they were fellowshipping together amen he's not weak in the flesh now the spirit of god departs from gethsemane and he's weak in the spirit and now weak in the spirit god is making him face the most difficult challenge of his life amen it's not always those times amen it's not going to be a camp meeting that wins the day and i have nothing against them because i love them i enjoy them i thoroughly enjoy them but that's not the time amen those are times to be strengthened in the spirit and be encouraged in the spirit amen and walk out of there strong in the spirit amen but it's those times all alone amen when nobody understands and you and god will won't speak to you when you can't get an answer and you know brother branham said like a black sheep it was like a black sheep coming down like you wouldn't even hear my prayer amen not the spiritual high but the spiritual low [Applause] how can something good be happening in a spiritual low look at gethsemane god wasn't there to encourage him he wasn't feeling anything do we understand he didn't have a he didn't have a feeling he couldn't feel the presence of the lord he didn't have a warm feeling in his heart amen he didn't have that connected feeling when you pray you feel like god you just connected with god he he wasn't feeling those things amen but yet god wanted it that way because he had to overcome himself he had to have the victory over his own humanity so this this trial was different than the first one and there's all kinds of trials but there's some trials that are different there's some things god asks sometimes as you think how could he ask such a thing how how could it be like this how could it be that a friend in the world won't stand with me it's not his disciples didn't love him they loved him but he had to do this by himself it wasn't that they did if they had understood if they had comprehended if they had just known amen they would have stayed right with him but god allowed him to not know and he allowed him to be heavy in the eyes so he had nobody to pray with him he had to pray alone and the spirit of god departed him brother bennett said in conference he said here he was standing in gethsemane that great suffering the sin of every man was upon him everything that ever died the death of that was placed upon him and he was innocent but he had to become sin can you the holy son of god take the sin of adultery can you take the sin the punishment of adultery can you take the sin the punishment of a lie can you take the sin of all these things can you bear them upon yourself yet innocent he was the only one the conference was met what did he say not my will thine be done oh god can we all hit a gethsemane conference that final checkup brother said can we all hit a gethsemane conference he was talking about there's been many conferences he had a conference with abraham at a conference with noah but can we hit the gethsemane conference that final checkup jesus was not going to suffer because of what he did wrong he was not asked to suffer because of his error he was not asked to suffer because of his sin he was not asked to suffer because of his unbelief he was asked to suffer for others he was innocent and brother said he didn't have to but he chose to i'm going to look for a minute at the humanity of jesus just so we could understand that he is our brother literally he's our brother he says in the message when their eyes were open they knew him he said she said in saint john the 11th chapter said the bible said when jesus went to the grave of lazarus he wept i said sure he's having a debate with a woman who says he wasn't divine i said sure she said well how could he how could he weep being divine i said well you just fail to see what he was when he went to the grave weeping he was a man but when he pulled his little shoulders together said lazarus come forth and a man that had been dead four days come up out of the grave that was more than a man that was god and a man see right he was a man when he came down off a mountain off the mountain was hungry and looked for god on a for food on a tree he cursed the tree because it had no food he was a man when he was hungry but when he took five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand and take up seven basketballs that was more than a man that was god in a man and god only represents himself in man he choose man when he was laying out there on the boat that night where virtue went out of him all day preaching and people pulling after him discerning they would discerning and so forth and the storm upon the sea i guess ten thousand devils swore they would drown him that night when he was laying back there asleep on the back of the boat them flopping around like a bottle stopper out there on the mighty sea somewhere he was a man when he was tired laying there sleeping that night but when he was once aroused put his foot on the braille of the boat looked up and said peace be still that was more than a man there yet that was god in a man he was a man when he died on the cross crying for mercy he was a man but when he broke the seals of death hell in the grave and rose up on the third day he proved he was more than a man it was god and a man no wonder every man that's ever amounted to anything believed that all poets and everything that's ever amounted to anything believe that that's right he was more than a man he was god do we believe that now that we we look at that and we understand that there was there was two parts there was a man and he was completely man that's what brother brother said and completely gone he said here in the message come follow me from 1963 and jesus was the transmitter of god's word for he was the triunity of god manifest in one man he was complete god and complete man complete god and complete man and it's interesting to me that we can look at that and say amen but that pattern continues today that pattern continues today the only difference was that was everything poured into one man and that one man was born without sin come virgin birth but the same pattern is laid out because all that was poor was god was poured into christ all that was in christ was poured into his church and the pattern continues and we have to catch the continuation of the pattern and let's go to john 11 the gospel of john chapter 11. john 11 and let's go to verse 32. he's come to the grave of uh he's coming to the grave of lazarus of lazarus knowing that he was dead it says then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down on his feet saying unto him lord if thou had been here my brother had not died when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled you see have you ever groaned in the spirit have you ever been troubled jesus was too he was complete man and complete god you know god was one who knows all things and has all things in control and everything's ticking just right on time but there's the man side that is going through the emotions of it all as well he he groaned he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have you laid him they said in him lord come and see jesus wept then said the jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused the even this man should have not died jesus therefore again groaned in himself coming to the grave so jesus it wasn't like amen being a god man that he could just skip up to the grave and say we're going to raise lazarus from the dead today and it it wasn't like that amen he was going through all the emotions that went with it amen he saw the suffering of the people and then he saw how mary wept how the jews went he disturbed him in his spirit it disturbed him in his spirit it groaned it troubled him when he when he knew that he was going to be deceived in the last supper he said he was troubled in spirit when he come to gethsemane he was sorrowful and very heavy praise the lord that shows there's nothing wrong with that when it happens to you that's part of the journey that's part of overcoming that's part of gethsemane he groaned he was troubled over being portrayed betrayed he called he called judas a friend he washed his feet knowing that friend would betray him and when he when he when he after he had washed her feet he sat down and and he was troubled in his spirit and he testified to him and said one among us will betray me you know the man's side wasn't enjoying it the man's side was suffering was troubled a man that had been a friend for all those years in the ministry they had ate together talked together no doubt had laughed together brother benham said jesus had a sense of humor he didn't like it but yet he surrendered to it it says in the message a prisoner from 1963 said now we're all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we wish to god justly does that because he put he must put every man on the same basis or he put the wrong man on he put the first man on the wrong bases that he put on a free moral agency see we're just exactly tonight like adam and eve there's no difference right and wrong sets before either one of us life and death we can make our choice up to you to make it what's interesting is this is where jesus was in gethsemane he couldn't make a choice i don't understand that don't don't don't come to me afterwards say brother chad how did that work with you know the perfect plan of god i have no idea but brother said he could make a choice he could stay with his disciples he could make a choice amen but he had to wrestle it out to make the choice that's the that's the part that really matters let's turn to genesis and look at this first trial there's just one thing i want to point out genesis 2 verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil how did that tree get there who put it there how did that tree get in the garden you know that's not how we would raise our children when we go in the backyard set up a play area you know we make it safe and you know we get out anything that would be dangerous and maybe fence it off and make it right but that's not how god made his garden he put the trial the temptation right there let's go over to verse 16 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest free lead but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it from the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die chapter 3 verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat and god didn't stop him and he didn't come down and he didn't make a lightning bolt strike the tree next to them to give him another warning he had already told him it was their choice and from that time on he set man on the same basis he could make a choice and and in order to make the choice it's not like flipping a coin it's not like rolling dice but these choices sometimes come down come with agony come with a real death it comes with a real a real real surrender i mean it's not you know we've i'll just say it this way we've had it pretty good we've had it pretty good we've lived in america we've had some freedoms and some privileges and we can come to church and we can we can worship the way we want and we could do you know we could we could live the message we could really live the message in america and so the making the choices you know we can make the choices and we've paid prices we've had we've had families reject us we've we've had churches reject us we've paid the price for making these choices but but god has a way of always turning the intensity up he's the one who can turn the dial because why he wants to prove that this bride is not like eve why did he let us come and satan see why does he let it get so bad why does he let things get more difficult why couldn't just continue on the way it was i liked the way it was i'm talking as a man now i liked being able to just come to church and worship and go home raise my family the way i want be able to homeschool them and teach them morality and teach them about god i like the way it was i didn't want anything to change and i would have never changed anything of my own free choice but that's not what god wants amen god wants to prove to satan she's not like ever and god amen had to prove jesus christ and he led him to go he led him by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil who led who where it was the spirit leading jesus christ to be tempted of the devil because he wanted to prove to satan that this is not like her amen this is not like the ones before amen he he did the same thing to job he wanted to prove to satan that job is a righteous man and he will not sin against me job's life was great but he come to a place he had to wrestle it out he wanted to prove to jesus i don't know what jesus is you know 30 years were like before we ended his ministry but he had to come to a proving time and the bride has to come to proving i should say times we've had times personal times where god's going to prove are we going to stay we're going to stay with this message or we're going to move on we've had opportunities to walk away somebody makes a good case somebody points out you know these are some discrepancies in what brother bam said and these dates don't match up and and this never happened and giving us an opportunity to walk away amen god didn't want to stop that he wanted the tree of knowledge of good and evil to be right here in this church right in your family maybe in your house he said well i mean if god wanted me to live the message why didn't he just shelter and protect me and just feed me only good stuff no god wanted that tree of knowledge and good of evil to grow right next to where you walk by every day [Applause] because he wants to prove why why why why i can't answer all the wise but one thing i know because there was a rebellion in heaven amen that deceived the angels amen and lucifer was lifted up and said i will amen lucifer amen brother brother branham said lucifer was god's right hand man we can't imagine what that was like i can't imagine what that was like lucifer's right hand man and he says co-equal in every way but creation i'd say co-equal in every way but creation is powerful and magnificent and and inspiring all right co-equal in every way except for creation and and he got to a place where iniquity was found in him iniquity is knowing to do right and not doing it knowing better iniquity was found in him and he he makes a statement i have it here we don't have to turn there but in isaiah 14 12 he says howarth are fallen from heaven a lucifer son of the morning how thou art cast down to the ground which should weaken the nations for thou has said in thy heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god who's the stars of god i will sit upon the mount of the congregation and the size of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high the problem in heaven was self-will the problem i'm not claiming to understand it but there was a battle in heaven there was a deception amen and you think those those angels you know how could they be deceived we have no idea how magnificent lucifer was we have no idea how magnificent he was and how what a what what a marvelous spectacle he was to look at and he was powerful and he was mighty and he was full of wisdom and he was perfect and all perfect in wisdom full of glory in fact sometimes i wonder this is this is just me so take it for just coming from a brother i wonder if god did the same thing there that he always does i wonder if god stayed a little bit in the background and unseen and obscure and let let michael and let lucifer out in the front so all the angels really was seeing was michael and lucifer working amen and they didn't actually know exactly where god was but they had to discern it maybe i mean that pillar of fire maybe they you know they saw how wonderful and how wise and how powerful lucifer was and brother bam said he could exalt his kingdom over michael's humble kingdom and i just wonder if it may not bend like we imagine like all the angels come up to god and see him you know in this form and say god what do you think is it lucifer or is it michael i wonder if it was kind of like it is now he works through these other vessels amen you have to discern where god is you have to be led of the spirit amen there's a great deception and there's always been a great deception in the church amen because he planted those true trees in his garden and this church is his garden and he planted two trees in his garden because god wanted to prove to prove to prove you know the proving is not easy we think you know are you gonna wear makeup or not wear makeup that's just the beginning are you going to be baptized in jesus name you can stick with your trinity baptism that's just the beginning that's just starting off will you believe god sent a prophet or not that's just the beginning friends but what does he want he wants a fully surrendered vessel that he can display himself through because jesus was every bit man in every bit god jesus could feel he could have agony he could have travail of soul he could have troubles he could be troubled in his spirit the problem in the beginning was lucifer saying i will and i'd say the problem today is us saying i will i will do this i will do that and i will do this and i will do that and god does not want anything that you can produce he just wants you to show what he can produce in the breach brother iran says now of course when adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given free moral agency it was given to them just as just as we so to make a choice now adam and eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before before them and that same tree sets before each and every one of us god isn't doing for adam or for eve you say well it's their fault no not now it isn't it's your fault it's not your fault you're born in hybrid flesh that's their fault but what you do with the word now is not their fault that's your fault that's my fault amen now we can't play we can blame them for coming in hybrid flesh we can blame them for being born this way brother bram said you came here in in this way no fault of your own you never did it in the first place but after coming here and after hearing the word now it's our fault we've been put on the same basis of adam and eve free moral agency to make our choice amen and sometimes we try to skirt around choice [Music] we try to we try to get around having to make choices we see something coming i mean there's a showdown coming we try to go another way to avoid the showdown to avoid the conflict avoid the conversation but god has a neat way of moving the pieces around so you come in contact with it again and come in contact with it again and come in contact with it again until finally you're able to be proven by that test now it's your fault you can't place it on adam now you got to place it on yourself because right and wrong is set before you we're on the same basis as adam and eve but you see when we were when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice but we want his choice this is the change that's taking place we no longer want his our choice but we want his choice and that's what's growing that's what should be growing in our lives all the time i i you know i'm getting to the point where sometimes it takes me so long just to make a decision amen because i just don't want to do what i want to do anymore i mean i could always make a quick decision we could always say let's make a decision amen and this is what i've told my family for a while because it's the way i'm wired i hate being halt between two opinions and i used to have this saying this phrase i don't use it anymore i said let's make it we're going to make a choice and stick with it even if it's wrong because i just get tired of the in-between we're going to make a decision stick with it and we're going to crash and burn on this one you know but not anymore because i don't want to make my choice anymore i don't want to have my own will anymore i just want it to be him and him only and it gets harder it gets harder because the circumstances aren't so black and white they're not so easy anymore it gets harder amen it's like he's clamping the pressure down amen and things are becoming more cloudy and unclear where is the right and wrong what is his will and my will you know when it was the makeup it was easy when it was the tv it was easy when it was the shorts it was easy when it was water baptism it was easy it was black and white but god has a way of getting down deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and he lets the circumstances be not so clear it's a little fuzzy to where you got to go all the way down deep amen and make a choice based off motive and objective based off things that are laying in the heart not the easy you know you know well you know people will think this if if i don't so i better do it amen he's getting it down where nobody will know or he'll make it to where 50 will say this is right and 50 will say that is right so you can't even take a consensus to figure out which way to go and you're left hanging there all alone half say this half say that and it's right back to you again and then you go to somebody who's senior to you and has wisdom amen and you ask them what should i do in this situation you know what many times when we begin to do that we're not looking for advice we're looking for an excuse we're looking to say if it didn't work out well he said my pastor said my dad said i asked so and so and they thought it was a good idea but god can take that away amen and the real wisdom of the wise will look at you and say i don't know i can't tell you what to do they'll look at you and say i don't know i'm not god you're in a pickle you're in a jam it could go one way or the other and you're just going to have to seek god for it that's a good answer that's always a good answer you see when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice but we want his choice see now adam and eve wanted their own choice they wanted to they wanted to find out what it was to have wisdom so they probed into it and it caused death now when man's been redeemed he don't care anymore for scholarship he don't care anymore for the things of the world for the wisdom of the world he don't want no choice at all christ has been his choice and that's all of it he's redeemed he just no more wants to lead himself he don't want nobody to talk to talk him into where to go and what to do he just waits and finds out the choice of his maker see then he goes in the name of his maker when the maker tells him to go so he gets maybe slower not faster with making choices maybe maybe you get to a place where somebody's like why why are you still sitting here just move but we get to a place where i just want his will that's all i want and until he tells me what to do i don't know what to do and until he tells me i have no idea what to do amen i'm going to wait till he forces the issue or he tells me what to do before i'm just going to make a choice that's a tough place to be brother brahm says in perfect strength my perfect weakness he said the greatest enemy i got is william branham i want to ask you who is jesus's enemy in the garden of gethsemane and of course you know the devil's there he's always there but i'm just reading through the scriptures jesus wasn't born in sin he wasn't hybrid brother i said the greatest enemy i got is william branham brother branham didn't say the devil the greatest enemy i got is me when god gets me to gethsemane i'm wrestling with one person and only one person i'm wrestling with me i'm trying to get past emotions feelings wants and desires there are things we want in this life we want another vehicle we would like to change houses we want another job i mean those are once and none of those are evil in themselves we want to do something we want to go somewhere we want to have more of this or we want less of that we have wants and desires and sometimes what god with the trial comes or a point of decision comes in such a way that god is telling us to give up those wants and we go to wrestling and who are we really wrestling with who is the real enemy right then me i'm the enemy i'm the one i'm the one who is holding back on what god's asked i'm the one amen sometimes we pray have you ever done this god's asking you to make a choice god's asking and and god's asking you to it's come to a tough spot give up something turn your back on something let an opportunity go do something and you come to the point where you're wrestling and wrestling and praying and praying and really there's nothing to pray about when it really comes down to it we'll fast we'll pray amen we'll go to prayer we'll come to the prayer time at church we'll we'll have other people pray with us but really if we would really be real honest with ourselves there was nothing to pray about from the beginning we knew what god was asking us to do we're just praying hoping god saying god can this cup pass from me god can this cup pass from me god can this cup pass from me it's the truth amen and and don't think that we're going to have less of this as we move forward it's going to come more it's time to be really honest with ourselves and quit playing uh games with ourselves and get down to the fact where we're either going to die or not we're either going to give it all a full surrender or we're not and god keeps pulling it back around before there's another surrender there's another choice to make and they'll bring it right around till there's another surrender and another choice to make what is it i think he wants preeminence i think it's the second fold of his threefold purpose i think he wants to come to perfect preeminence in a body of believers and he's doing that now how's he doing it he's getting us to wrestle with our own humanity and overcome the greatest enemy we got which is ourselves if jesus had to battle out self-will why because lucifer said i will don't think what we're going through here isn't connected with that what we're going through here is connected directly connected with what happened there and lucifer said i will eve said i will adam said i will but jesus says not my will [Applause] but it wasn't easy friends that's the point when jesus get not my will it wasn't an easy decision it wasn't easy it wasn't happy he wasn't popping chewing gum talking to his disciples laid out under a tree and said yep i think i'll do that it came with agony and trouble and spirit and great sorrow and heaviness in his spirit and if the son of god had to suffer that way to make that choice to fully surrender and die out what do you think it's going to be like for us it's not that's why brother branham said when in in these meetings he said i was watching a a religious service amen and they had the altar call and they went up there popping chewing gum and punching each other in the arm amen and when going up and wrestling with each other he said that's not the way to come you come dead you come to die you come to surrender all it's not a stand to your feet and repeat after me okay now you're safe no it's a it's a wallowing it out it's a wrestling it out and saying i'm tired of my own life i'm tired of my own way i want to surrender to him it's not a i think i'll go to church today and it's not i think i decide i'll be a christian because that looks pretty nice it's not that at all it's coming down to the fact that you realize that there's rottenness inside of me and i can't overcome me there's rottenness filthiness inside of me and no matter how much i try to do right i can't do right i need something that can clean out me and the only thing that can clean out me is him i've got to have him not because it's a good choice not because it's a good option because it's the only choice i've got to have the baptism the holy ghost not so i can have power so not so i can be excited so that i could actually live with myself because the greatest enemy i got is not the person who's causing me problems next time you say that guy at work oh my goodness he's really he's a problem for me it's not the guy at work i got a neighbor he's really it's not the neighbor it's you i got a son or a daughter i got a spouse if you knew my husband the problem's not your husband the problem's not your wife the problem's the one looking you in the mirror it's the truth across the board this person's giving me so much trouble this person that person if you were dead to self that person couldn't bother you amen jesus he could walk through all of the heretics i mean he could walk through all the religious leaders amen and and they didn't disrupt him he would tell them an answer to their question you know why this and why that he said because you have your father the devil he was pretty honest but it didn't knock him off course it didn't derail him from what he was supposed to do it didn't stop him amen from loving it didn't stop him from serving it didn't stop him from telling the truth jesus problem amen wasn't the pharisees i mean that was just the enemy trying to distract him that was the enemy trying to get him off course when he come down to it when jesus had when he was heavy and sorrowful and wrestling out in gethsemane what he was overcoming was self-will wanting to stay with his disciples wanting to bypass calvary but he had to wrestle it out so he could say lord i love that scripture and mark father you can do all things prayed that i've prayed that i'm standing right in the face of situations i absolutely can't change and it's right there and you still say father you can do all things and he doesn't say nothing back father you can make this go away like that just i've i've even prayed before i said if you just twitch your finger it'll all be over nothing because god was not interested in delivering me from my trouble god was interested in delivering me from me if we can get delivered from self i'm telling you nothing is impossible if we could get delivered from self nothing is impossible if brother brahm is saying one man fully surrendered in god's hand is enough to shake the whole world what if he could get a body of believers what if he could get a people on this planet fully surrendered and totally in his hand amen what would it just shaking be like then you know we would avoid gethsemane i can tell you right now today i would like to bypass gethsemane but there's another part of me like jesus for the glory that lay ahead he endured the christ the cross despising the shame there's something else inside of us friends that say you know what i don't want to go through gethsemane you know i don't want to suffer i don't want to face temptation but if i gotta pass through that to get there then i'll pass through that is that it's something in us pulling us back home it's something in us pulling us to our father it's the god part inside the man part something greater than us let's read this quote i haven't got past the first line perfect strength by perfect weakness the greatest enemy i got is william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves god right out of the picture but when i can get rid of that guy when i can get to a place that he's out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about that's when god can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we get ourselves in the way then we cannot jesus said to his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself that's what he was trying to get the rich young ruler to do deny himself if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross what do they do with a cross they kill you on it deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it in gethsemane jesus was being asked to lose his life and he had to wrestle it out here we are today being asked to lose our life and we're going to have to wrestle it out i mean i can i can i could right now say let's all bow our heads don't because i'm not asking that and i say who wants to surrender their life to the lord and who wants to lose their life to find it everybody would raise their hands but that's nothing that's just raising a hand and saying that's what i want but that decision will have to be proved in gethsemane don't think it's going to be as easy as bowing ahead one day and raising a hand and saying i give my i want i want what you're talking about preacher that's the start that's you make an acknowledgement and say that's what i want but what you want has got to grow in your heart and it's got to get to the place where you want that more than you want anything else and you better believe that'll be put to the test that'll be tested time and time again and the test will get more intense as time goes on and then because he's trying to prove to satan she's not like you she will stick with this all the way through but don't think that you can pray at an altar one time and it's done amen raise your hand one time and it's done that decision at that altar will be tested that decision when you raise your hand we've seen many of people pray at the altar we've seen many people raise a hand we've seen many people turn their back on the word and walk away why because when it come down to dying or living for christ living for self or living for christ they wanted self more than living for christ they wanted my will not his will they came to gethsemane and when they came to gethsemane they said nope that's not it and in order to justify themselves they had to find a problem with the message and the problem was never the message the problem was always self. the problem wasn't the preacher the problem was in the message the problem was in the church the problem wasn't the denomination the problem wasn't rules the problem wasn't the abuse from my childhood that's never been the problem it never will be the problem the problem is always self [Applause] but we've got to find somebody to point a finger to because we don't want to point the finger here why did you walk away from truth why did you let down the standard why did you leave the church why did you go out in the world why did you do that well because of this preacher and because my mom and dad and because the brother bam said this and because the discrepancies hey that's never been the problem friends those are all there to prove what's inside of you the abuses the neglects the parents the preachers the church split it's all been there it's all ordained of god it's all there to prove that she's not like eve [Applause] if this message is true how can there be so many problems if this message is true how many church places this message is true how come there's so many different ideas and different preachers preaching how come there's so much contention to prove that she's not like eve [Applause] that's no excuse to leave christ there's no excuse to walk away that's no excuse to go out amen that all that does is expose that you weren't dead yet and you still loved yourself more than you loved the word of god amen that's just the raw bitter truth as true as you can lay it but when we finally come to gethsemane and say father i don't want to surrender i want to keep living that's what jesus's battle was is he going to take the sins of the world and be crucified is he going to stay with his disciples that's what brother branham said and we come to gethsemane and say ah i still you know i still have a few desires i still have a few things i'd like to do in my life experience father is there any other way father is there any other way you know the scripture doesn't give us any dialogue back i wonder if there was any dialogue back i know in some of my guests some of the experiences there's been no dialogue back and some of brother branham's there was no dialogue back father could you lord would you raise up sharon rose no dialogue back there was only one other person who would talk to him then god wouldn't but the devil would you raise up sharon rose silence what if that was your baby laying in that crib with its eyes crossed and you had to shoo the flies away and you're praying your heart out to god for your baby and you just buried your wife it's not a story it's the reality of a christian life these are the realities of a christian life brother bram said we do a disservice amen by taking the picture of christian you become a christian and god paves the way and he gives you everything you want and you do a disservice to christianity amen as soon as you give your life to christ you have surrendered on become a love slave to him and everybody in the word who became a love slave to him had to sacrifice had to give up had to be rejected and abused and cast out and slain what is that that's real christianity but they all got to a place that the reality of god was greater than the reality that they saw and they were willing to give up what they held for what he promised that's the real decision it's not making a decision for christ amen it's it's making a decision to die if we can just lose our life we can find it brother brahman said improving his word now to heal i cannot you know that what is a gift brother branham something that you take no it's something you know how to get yourself out of the way as long as you're there it'll never work william branham is the greatest enemy i got see but when i get him out of the way see then jesus christ can use the body what is it we want we want jesus christ to use this body this body was born in corruption born in sin born in corruption but it's been redeemed by the blood of jesus christ it has been sanctified by the word and by the life and now it's a dwelling place for the spirit of god and now there's god men and women on the earth again let's go to john 14. i want to talk about peter for a minute peter come to gethsemane with jesus and while jesus is surrendering all peter's sleeping right but when the guards show up peter snaps into action and goes to kill what's he doing he's fighting for his religion he's fighting for his position he's fighting to save jesus and then he gets scared and runs away see all of this is self swinging the sword was self running array with self going into the into the temple where jesus or to the to the uh palace where jesus was being interrogated amen and he was asked three times if he was one of his disciples and he denied three times what was that that was self self self self then he runs out and weeps bitterly what was that self but when we come to either first or second peter he says now i know that the time of my departure is near and so i want to take a minute to remind you although you know this and i'm establishing the present truth but i want to stir up your memory now the man who was scared and fighting and now he's just as calm as can be he's writing to them and saying there are some things i want to tell you because the time of my departure is near as the lord has showed me he was going to be crucified he was going to be taken amen and he didn't want to be crucified like christ so he wanted to turn him upside down because he didn't feel worthy to be crucified in the same manner as his savior he was going to his death but something changed between that gethsemane and the one he's talking about in peter first or second peter something changed peter died so that peter could die i'll say it like this jesus went to calvary a dead man you understand what i'm saying jesus went to calvary a dead man what they did at calvary was took care of the flesh but the decision had already been made in gethsemane the choice had been already made the death had already been made it had already been sealed in gethsemane amen they just took care of the physical portion of the physical body but he had already surrendered his spirit to the will of god in gethsemane and that's why it's time now to die the physical part will be taken care of we'll go by the grave or we'll go by the veil amen the physical part is going to be taken care of we're not worried about how the physical part amen how it ends its life i'm worried about bringing that spirit in me subject to his spirit to dying to self to letting him live that's the battle we're fighting right now amen that's that's the death we want to come to right now john 14 8 philip saith unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus said unto them i have been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father and me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake philip said show me the father philip could see the man but he wasn't recognizing the father is that clear he saw the man but he was missing the father he said show us the father he said have i been so long with you that you don't know me i'm man i'm son and in me is father he says i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak in you i speak not of myself not the man part i speak not of myself the words i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works he was the god man and philip was looking at the god the man part and he's talking about the father he says show us the father he says you've already been seeing the father and didn't know it because the father is in my flesh he's in me he's in the flesh he's the one who's living the life he's the one who's doing the works he's the one who's speaking the words now let's skip down to verse 19. we're in the same discussion jesus is talking to him after this question verse 19 he says yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you so show us the father show me the father show me jesus christ because wherever the father has went to jesus is in the father and then they've went and made their abode somewhere he said we will come and make our abode so now the father he said i'm in the father father and me he says i in you and you and me and so now we look at this picture we say so now where's the father where's the son where's the father and the son because they're going to abide together somewhere where are they abiding they're abiding in vessels of clay they're abiding in flesh and we can see the man but can we see the god-man and the god-woman can we see that it's god trying to take control of human flesh so that he can manifest himself perfectly like he did in jesus christ what does he need he needs your vessel he needs you to die because there's something inside of you that needs to be triggered or unlocked so that it can come to life brother branham says in the rising of the sun 1965 and so it is today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what the people say about us our name ain't nothing oh we've got to be here that's a nice quote but it's got to be real in us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life is nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there is only one thing that we love to do is to see him glorified and how can it be when he's glorified in us by his resurrection that's in us we see him represented again as he was today did you get that see our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not boost some church or make more in sunday school or try to bring in hogtie push in offer a picnic party or bring stars buttons or something else like that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorified glorified what not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us show me the father the only way you're going to see the father is if he's manifesting himself and his children because that's the method he's choosing in this day is to manifest himself in his bride that's where christ is our lives to prove he's alive and living in us if i can get myself out of the way so when william branham not even thought of and you not even thought of till we can see jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire what's the key he's in there do you believe he's in you you believe that he's in you then what do we have to do get ourselves out of the way brother branham knew it wasn't him he couldn't discern the thoughts and intents of the heart he couldn't heal the sick he couldn't do any of those things he couldn't give himself a vision he couldn't do that it was god inside of him using his flesh but what did he have to do he had to learn to get himself out of the way so that god could do something and what are we learning to get ourselves out of the way to die to self that's that gives us quickening power it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him and seeing his same vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead see no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are redeemed by him now risen with him that's what easter means to the people risen with him i notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid no you don't say well i hope i make it you've already made it not i will make it i've already made it i never made it he made it for me see not me him well brother branham i don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all i want i'm caring about i just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down he says i just want to see him manifested how are we going to see memphis what are you going to do call him down oh great jehovah come down and manifest yourself oh great god come down now and show yourself mighty he says no listen carefully he says how can you do it call him down no he's in you it's not a calling down for a great manifestation he's already in the bride he's already housed bottled and confined in his bride that's what brother branham said he's already in you we're not calling something down oh great glory something come down what we're trying to do is die a little more to get out of his way so it can be expressed because it's already in you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he's in you and you're in him seated in christ jesus in heavenly places it's finished it's done it's there but what we have to do is wrestle this humanity down amen and die to ourself we got to go through gethsemane until we're willing to give up our wants our desires our pleasures our everything you know the reason we fight and argue is because we think somebody shouldn't treat us bad you know why we get our feelings hurt because we think that somebody shouldn't say those things about us it's not nice not dead yet what do we get our feelings are and retaliate why do we why do we retaliate and bark back or say something mean back why because we're not dead yet i remember one time so clearly brother lonnie said anybody said it many times he said you can walk up to a corpse and kick him and he won't kick you back you can spit on him and he won't spit back jesus went to calvary a dead man they spit on him he didn't spit back they called him bad names he didn't call names back they ripped out his beard he did nothing back and when peter when he rebuked peter for taking his sword and cutting off the ear of the high priest servant when he rebuked him he said put up your sword don't you know that i could call for 12 legions of angels and my father would give them to me he wasn't helpless he wasn't powerless he wasn't without authority and power to change his situation he wasn't wrestled into that situation he wrestled himself into that situation he said i don't know man takes my life i lay my life down and i raise it up again they didn't kill him he forfeited his life it wasn't their power over him it was his power over himself that allowed them to take his body and crucify it amen you realize brother branham he would quote billy sunday see like billy sunday said he said every tree had an angel sitting in it all around and if he would have just twitched his finger on the cross it would have ended the whole scene if he would have been offended feelings hurt angry because of the way they treated him he would have called legions down to change the situation but he died in gethsemane and went to calvary a dead man they could hit him over the head with a stick and say you say you're a prophet prophesy he had nothing to prove because he was dead he had finally surrendered all he had surrendered all his life but it come to the test and he had surrendered all mocked him made fun of him laughed at him beat him he didn't do anything in fact if you watch from gethsemane to calvary he hardly says a word just fragments of sentences he's got nothing to defend nothing to prove he's got he's not going to defend himself he's not going to uphold his reputation he's not going to make somebody else convince somebody else they're wrong he's right he went to calvary a dead man i said lord help me die so you can have that kind of control in me i long for that i long and guess what he's gracious he brings along exactly what we need and he knows how to cut us where only he can cut us if he knew if he knew the one spot that the rich young ruler couldn't give up he could keep all the commandments brother branham he goes on and talks about influence and he speaks of the rich young ruler many times he preaches it many times and and no doubt he was generous and he supported you know the community and he gave to the poor no doubt he was a good guy brother said he was a good boy he'd always been a good boy but there was something down in his heart that was going to keep him from a full surrender and only god knew what that was and god in his love didn't allow him to bypass that thing but god in his love took it straight to him how many of you believe god loves you he's the one with the scalpel and he knows what's holding us back he knows what's laying in our heart and his great love doesn't allow us to bypass it but his great love will bring us right into contact with it and then we have a choice to make do i drink of this cup or do i bypass it and at some point every one of us will say i'll drink of this cup if there's no other way if this is what you want i'll surrender it to you i'll drink of this come i'm in the same quote it is the rising of the sun how can you do it call him down no he's in you he's in you well then lord if i can get myself out of the way you can manifest what's holding back the manifestation of christ me i hope you can look in the mirror and say it's not that well if if they could just do this or if we would change this or preach it this way or no what's holding back the manifestation of christ me if i can get myself out of the way and the more out of the way i can get the more he can come out and the more this flesh can be subdued the more he can be glorified i can get myself out of the way you can't you can manifest how can you do it because you ordained us so all that the father has given me will come notice glory you believe that we shall rise in him we become part of him the easter the revealed secret of god like it was then of life after death we are now alive who who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true easter seals broke death from around me and i'm alive the easter seal at the beginning broke the seal of the roman seal the easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now god by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and christ is revealed as he lives in us for now we are quickened with him i'll tell you friends if we can go to gethsemane and die then god can do whatever he wants with our flesh and we can have a resurrection we can have a resurrection and be resurrected with him now not a future resurrection but a present tense resurrection that we live in him living in us let's look at first peter i want to read this last scripture and we'll close with the last scripture and one quote first peter chapter four first peter chapter 4 and verse 1. for as much then as christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of god oh doesn't that sound good friends if we could just be of the same mind of suffering that christ was we could be in the same mind for he that suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men i don't want to live the rest of my time in this flesh to the lust of men but to the will of god i want to be of the same mind that christ was whatever you have to suffer through whatever you got to do to purge me to to break me amen to tell me exactly what i need to hear like the rich young ruler if you've got to look me right in the eye if you use a preacher use a spouse you use the tape whatever you use but if you look me right down the eye and you say this is your problem you're this you're holding on to an old hurt or you're you're you love yourself more than you love god or you love the things of the world amen god if you're going to tell it i'm going to say all right lord cut it out of me i'm laying myself down on the table now lord you're the only one who knows me you're the only one who can expose that thing in me you're the only one who can cut it out of me lord i'm asking you cut it out of me i surrender now so that now i can live the rest of my time in flesh not to the lust of men but to the will of god what is that the second fold of the threefold purpose that god had in his mind before the foundation of the world the one thing he has purposed in all the bible and the one thing he wanted to achieve in all the scripture was that you would live the rest of your days not in the lust of the flesh but in the will of god and guess what he's going to accomplish this scripture someday this scripture is not a scripture it's not a memory verse this will become a living reality upon this earth and a group of people called the bride of jesus christ and i'm desiring more than ever to have it right here that i live the rest of my time in flesh not in the will the lust of the flesh but in the will of god i say god if this is gethsemane i take your will if i if it all has to be stripped away nevertheless not my will but your will be done in my life if you lose friends separated from the ones you love mocked and scourged and beat ridiculed and abused not my will but your will be done if we could just die if we could die there's nothing another human being could do to us to throw us off course there's nothing another human being could do to us to upset the plan of god in our lives if we could just surrender all and die jesus says don't fear those that can kill the body don't be afraid of that but feel here fear him that can kill the body and the soul in hell don't be afraid of what they do with this you die to the flesh on the inside you die out then whatever happens to this doesn't matter anymore because you're already dead i wonder if we could walk through life dead men and women dead to the flesh but alive in christ i wonder if we could walk in this life resurrected sons and daughters of god having died out to self and resurrected a new life of jesus christ and now it's not me somebody comes up to you and they say oh i just really like your family i'm like it's not me it's not me i couldn't do this i tried and it didn't work somebody comes up to you and say oh i just like the way you're dressed i just like the holiness it's not me it's not me what you're seeing is the father in me it's his works it's not me i had to die to me so that he could do this i had to die to me so that he could be made manifest i had to die to me so that the word would be on display it's not me it's not me there's no religious pride no religious pride no oh you know you've got a nice church and everybody down there it's not me you have a nice family it's not me i like the way you just got such a nice you know somebody will say to you just got such a nice atmosphere around you i just like to be around you say you should have seen me before no one liked to be around me i was angry and contentious and snarling and snapping what changed it's not me but you're seeing the father in me it's his works on display see it's death it takes religious pride out of the picture there is nothing we can do there's nothing we can accomplish for him there's nothing we can do in our own effort to make him happier to please him the only thing that will make him happy is a total surrender and a death to self and then it's him musicians you can come let's all stand i'm just going to stop here you know when jesus went to the temptation in the wilderness he had the spirit of god had just descended on him like a dove and he was fasting his flesh was weak but he was strong in the spirit he went out and he did wonderful things mighty things and the fame went abroad and he was glorified of all but when he come to gethsemane this time it wasn't his flesh that was weak amen this was the spirit but the member said the spirit of god departed him in gethsemane he went to calvary a man and from that time until he died on the cross we see weakness humility quietness there was only one thing he did and that's when he touched the high priest servant ear and healed his ear but after that the picture is different than it was when he came out of the wilderness temptation he cut around the wilderness temptation doing a lot of things that people saw and his fame went abroad and they he was glorified of all but when he come out of gethsemane he didn't say much he didn't do much but the picture was different he was spit on beat mocked accused and he opened not his mouth before his accusers i think all god wants is for us to die not to say you know we're going to do this we're going to do that all these great things but just die to where if he wants to use you to do something to manifest healing if he wants to manifest whatever he can do that if he wants to manifest humility and brokenness he can manifest that if you want to manifest quiet surrender he can manifest that if he wants to manifest dynamic healing he can manifest that but all he wants is for a surrender brother brahm said and who is this melchizedek notice after the battle was over melchizedek served his victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here and type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of christ and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out so where's the struggle where's the struggle who where's my struggle when you've after you've done got yourself whipped out then is when you partake of christ become part of his being that's when resurrection comes is after we've got ourself done whipped out oh we've been through that journey but it's something that keeps repeating and repeating and repeating and when we come to gethsemane friends realize that god's asking us a question is it going to be my way or your way you pick brother graham said i didn't have to do all these things he said i could have went and sat on the riverbank and fished every day of my life and been just as saved i don't understand that either don't ask me how to make it make sense he just said it i believe it he had a choice remember when danny henry spoke over him in french he says thou has chosen the hard way the narrow way you did this of your own choosing [Music] he had to wrestle with himself amen he made the wrong choice he lost his wife he lost his baby amen and now he comes to another risky choice and he makes the choice and he goes out as david going to face goliath but he did it of his own choosing jesus made a decision in gethsemane he wrestled with his flesh and he did it of his own choosing and this bride is going to overcome self amen and he's going to be manifest amen in his bride and it's going to be by her own choosing when we face gethsemane let's make the right choice because if we don't it's not like he's leaving without you it's not like he'll finish his purpose without you it's already ordained so that means we're just going to circle back to another gethsemane and if we make the wrong choice we'll circle back to another gethsemane at some point we're going to make the right choice and say not my will but thy will be done oh god praise god let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus oh god we just want to surrender lord god we have among us now our older brothers and sisters who walked this path longer than we they've seen a lot lord and they've done a lot and they've experienced a lot but yet they still want to surrender all they want a greater surrender lord and it's encouraging us who's following after them that we want a greater surrender too lord it doesn't matter how young or how old if we're new in this journey or we've done it for a long time we still want to surrender all lord we want you to be magnified and glorified in us and we want the ability in gethsemane to say not my will but thy will be done all gone we love you jesus we ask that you would take your people lord and you would minister to them yourself lord i believe you spoke your word i believe lord that you've taken control and spoke what you wanted spoke but i pray on an individual level you would take the scalpel and you would do the heart surgery [Music] and god that you would have a people that would make the right choice that would choose the narrow path that would choose the harder way and that they would do it of their own choosing not because you forced but because you gave the opportunity and they chose give us lord your grace lord if we failed in the past lord i pray you give us another chance god help us lord not to fail you now we love you lord strengthen us and use us for your glory help us to get ourselves out of the way that you can be made manifest we all we love you and ask lord that you would take your people from here as they travel home and travel wherever they go i pray god that you shine your light upon them lord and manifest yourself through them have your way with your little bride lord because we recognize that there's an abode a dwelling place for you on this earth and you're there behind the veil of skins god i just pray lord that you would rent the veil of self-will so that you can be manifest there behind the veil we love your god and ask your blessing in jesus christ's name amen [Music] your spirits me lord and make me more lightly [Music] praised is let me be [Music] your spirit me and make me more like me me lord and bless the broken peace [Music] jesus said no man takes my life but i lay it down [Music] you realize even god won't kill you he wants you to lay it down by free choice that you make a decision to go the harder way god's not going to come enslave jesus looked at the rich young ruler said this is your problem but that rich young ruler had a choice to lay his life down to lose his life or save it he made his choice [Music] when he come to peter james and john he said drop your nets and follow after me and i'll make you fishers of men and they have their own choice drop their nets jesus didn't rip it out of their hands they dropped it willingly we've gotta make our choice god's not gonna come by and say you need to be dead and kill you oh we've been in trials before i've cried out god you're killing me i can't take any more but really he's not going to kill you he's going to bring you to the point of decision and if you die you're going to die of your own free choice you're going to finally lay down and say lord take me i'm all yours i lay down my life he's not going to kill me he's not going to force it he's going to give me the opportunity and he's going to ask me to make my choice [Music] and everybody who makes this life in a full surrender and lives for jesus christ will do so because they chose to of their own free choice i say lord help me help me in the hour i need to lay down my life help me not to do as a rich young ruler and just walk away but help me to say oh i surrender all oh god bless you we've got several that are here new since we started this new format so i just want to explain we're going to sing for a little bit brother blake
