========================================

There can be one in the bed who has the revelation that Christ has taken his proper place on my heart because I am his redeemed subject and he is on the throne of my heart. And there can be another in the field who says I don't see anybody coming. I haven't heard anything. There can be one at the mill grinding. You understand? Amen. The same can be true for the gentile bride. Christ has left the intercessory seat for me. Amen. Because he's came came and he's claimed me. Amen. There may be somebody walking that door in five minutes that Christ has got to still be on the inter intercessory seat in their lives. Amen. And that is perfectly fine. Amen. Amen. Amen. But there'll be a day after he's interceded for them and they've come to the recognition of their sacrifice and accepted it, he's going to move off of his intercessory seat and claim them by moving onto the throne of their heart. Amen. Praise God. Let's not get bogged down on where is it? Where it's like we Oh, mercy. It's like we think God has to be in a box and we got to move him from one place. No, no. We're a gentile people, a spiritual relationship. He can be in many different manifestations and capacities and offices re depending on what individual he's dealing with. That's right. Amen. Amen. But I thank God that as of 1963, the opportunity for him to move from just an intercessor and my savior to my bridegroom, to my husband, to my redeemer. Amen. That opportunity came into existence in 1963. Amen. I don't know how many people caught it then. I'm willing to bet it was a few. That's right. But I'm also willing to bet there's a lot more who've caught it since then. Amen. Amen, sir. And that by no means means that somebody else can't catch the revelation of him being their intercessor. It's still available. Amen. So long as one of his children needs him to be an intercessor, he's still an intercessor on the throne. Amen. Praise God. But as time winds down and dispensation changes, there's going to come a point in time that each of his children, his elect bride, comes to the recognition, I'm just not a sinner saved by grace. I am a sinner saved by grace, but I'm not just a sinner saved by grace. Praise God. Amen. I was actually in his mind before the foundation of the world. He has actually left his father's throne and came and sat on my throne. And now I live my daily life riding on this power following this one who has fire and word and a sword coming out of his mouth. Amen.
