[10:33] various kinds I pray you go to them now

[10:52] that you would help us tonight as we
[10:53] look into your word may you come
[10:54] yourself and break the bread of life for
[10:56] us and Feed Us of your own hand Lord
[10:59] Lord for we're utterly completely
[11:00] dependent upon you I ask the Lord that
[11:03] your spirit would move freely Lord and
[11:05] and God we would do nothing or say any
[11:07] nothing to hinder Lord the flowing of
[11:09] your spirit that your word might go
[11:10] forth in power Lord I I pray God that
[11:13] you would take this vessel under your
[11:15] control and speak Eternal words these
[11:18] lips of clay May that word go into our
[11:20] hearts Lord may it drop in deep and take
[11:23] root Lord and produce a crop for that's

[11:32] pray almighty God as we surrender to you
[11:35] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[11:39] God bless you all let's take our Bibles
[11:41] while we're still standing and turn to
[11:43] First John the Epistle of first johnen
[11:47] it's good to be together on the first
[11:48] official service of
[11:50] 2024 amen I'm so glad we're able to be
[11:53] together God is good to us amen and we
[11:56] pray that God Amen starts us off on the
[11:59] right foot
[12:00] amen praise
[12:02] God I want to look at first John chapter
[12:05] 4 and I'm want to read two scriptures
[12:07] out of 1 John chapter
[12:10] 4 1 John 4 and the first one we'll read
[12:13] is verse 8 he that loveth not knoweth
[12:16] not God for God is love let's go down to
[12:20] verse 16 and we have known and believe
[12:23] the love that God hath to us God is love
[12:26] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[12:28] God in God in himen God bless you as you
[12:32] take your
[12:33] seats so we know that God is
[12:37] love
[12:39] amen and he that dwelleth in love
[12:41] dwelleth in God and God in him amen and
[12:44] I want to take for a title if I can for
[12:46] this evening for a subject is love
[12:48] brings Revelation and Revelation brings
[12:51] love love brings Revelation and
[12:53] Revelation brings love and I I I really
[12:57] want to uh tonight if I could just speak
[12:59] on John the Apostle John and the
[13:02] disciple John I want to speak on John I
[13:05] want to speak on the Book of John the
[13:07] Epistles of John and the Book of
[13:09] Revelation and kind of tie all those
[13:10] together and I just pray that that you
[13:13] pull on the gift because I all of this
[13:15] stuff floods through my heart as I
[13:17] meditate and all these pieces come
[13:19] together and for me when I'm sitting and
[13:21] meditating on this I was sharing this
[13:23] with brother Franco today when I'm
[13:25] meditating on this all of a sudden
[13:27] everything just congeals together
[13:28] together and everything all these little
[13:30] pieces become one picture it's almost
[13:33] like a thousand piece jigsaw all of a
[13:35] sudden I see the whole thing and now I
[13:37] come with a thousand pieces and I don't
[13:39] know how to get you to see the same
[13:40] thing that I see it's going to take the
[13:43] anointing of the Holy Ghost operating
[13:45] through a gift amen because I want God
[13:47] to do the same thing for you that he's
[13:48] done for me amen and take all these
[13:51] pieces and put them together so it
[13:52] Paints the same picture that that is in
[13:54] my heart
[13:55] Amen in the Ephesians Church age brother
[13:58] bam said from the church age book he
[13:59] says a few moments ago I mentioned that
[14:01] John understood what it was to love God
[14:04] the great Apostle of Love would
[14:07] certainly see it when the church began
[14:08] to lose that first love of God so
[14:10] brother Brenham calls John the Apostle
[14:12] of love he also in another place calls
[14:14] him the disciple of love amen and and we
[14:17] know we know because we've been through
[14:19] it so many times and we're going to go
[14:20] into it again today and read the quotes
[14:22] but we know that John Amen in the Book
[14:25] of Revelation is a type of the church
[14:26] he's a type of the Bride amen so I want
[14:29] you to lock that into your heart and
[14:31] allow that uh allow that to be true as
[14:34] we talk about this so John is a type of
[14:37] the Bride amen and John is the Apostle
[14:40] of
[14:41] love and and as we look through this
[14:44] we're going to see John has a unique
[14:45] relationship with the Lord John has a
[14:47] unique Revelation John is John sees what
[14:50] none of the other disciples
[14:52] see John John was the youngest disciple
[14:56] at the time Jesus was walking on this
[14:58] Earth and after he departed amen John
[15:01] with a special relationship with with
[15:03] Jesus Christ amen and we'll explore that
[15:06] through the scriptures but but he's the
[15:09] last Apostle Amen to remain alive after
[15:12] they're all deceased amen and it's all
[15:15] showing a tye because John was the one
[15:18] who made it longest he was the longest
[15:20] lasting or the longest living disciple
[15:22] amen and he made it all the way to the
[15:23] island of patmas where he was caught up
[15:25] in a vision and taken to the Lord's day
[15:28] and he saw all the way to the end amen
[15:31] and so he's a type of the Bride because
[15:33] the bride would be the last of the seven
[15:35] Church ages she would be the last amen
[15:37] of the Bride the last of the Bride that
[15:39] would be on earth so she outlived them
[15:42] all you see that and she herself will
[15:45] get caught up amen into the Revelation
[15:48] and see all the way to the end as well
[15:51] amen so you see the types and
[15:52] similarities we're talking about John
[15:55] the Apostle John we're talking about the
[15:57] the the the go Gospel of John the
[15:59] Epistles of John and the Book of
[16:01] Revelation but what we're really wanting
[16:03] to see is an identification of
[16:07] ourselves amen so brother Ram says in
[16:10] the message do you now believe said now
[16:12] in St John you say uh brother bham you
[16:15] sure read a lot out of St John he said
[16:18] it's one of my favorites John is a book
[16:21] of
[16:22] love oh my goodness we're going to see
[16:24] that you get into the Epistles of John
[16:26] it's so evident in the Epistles of John
[16:28] first second and third amen all through
[16:30] it he's crying out little children love
[16:32] one another Above All Things love one
[16:34] another he that knoweth God a he that
[16:36] knoweth uh uh he that loveth not knoweth
[16:38] not God for God is love the things that
[16:40] we just read but all through these
[16:42] Apostles or these Epistles first second
[16:44] third he's talking about love and love
[16:46] one another and love the Brethren and
[16:49] and and all of these things he says if
[16:50] you don't love one another how can you
[16:51] say you love God who you've not seen and
[16:54] you can't love your brother who you can
[16:55] see amen John is the Apostle of love the
[16:58] Epistles are all about love but then
[17:00] brother brandham says that St John The
[17:02] Gospel of John is a book of
[17:04] love what is the relationship between
[17:07] Christ and his bride it's a love
[17:08] relationship all of these you see what
[17:11] I'm I'm trying to say all of these
[17:12] pieces are starting to congeal and paint
[17:15] one picture
[17:17] amen
[17:20] so and and this is where brother R says
[17:22] that about the Epistles and he said we
[17:24] always know uh Peter of course we always
[17:27] know that he's the Great Burly faith
[17:29] that just reaches out after it whether
[17:31] you can see it or not and hope is James
[17:33] and John was charity because John even
[17:36] as Epistles were called the Epistles of
[17:38] love so now we see John is love and and
[17:41] and we heard uh uh uh when when uh uh
[17:45] Brother Kyle preached he talked about
[17:47] Peter James and John faith hope and
[17:49] charity Charity's love and they were
[17:51] taken up on the mount Transfiguration to
[17:53] be those Witnesses John is always typed
[17:55] with love and John is typed with the
[17:57] bride
[17:59] amen so now we're beginning to see our
[18:01] position now in the breach uh uh uh
[18:07] brother banham starts to explain
[18:09] something in the breach that I want to
[18:10] capture as well but let's first turn to
[18:12] Revelation CH 4 together and let's read
[18:15] the
[18:21] scripture by the grace of God I'm just
[18:23] going to throw a ton of pieces out and
[18:25] then ask God to help us put them
[18:27] together where so don't get nervous
[18:29] we're throwing puzzle pieces
[18:31] everywhere but we ask God to help us
[18:33] find where they fit Revelation
[18:36] 4:6 and Before the Throne there was a
[18:39] sea of glass like un Crystal and in the
[18:41] midst of the throne and round about The
[18:43] Throne were four beasts full of eyes
[18:46] before and behind and the first Beast
[18:48] was like a lion and the second beast
[18:50] like a calf and the third Beast had a
[18:52] face of a man and the fourth Beast was
[18:54] like a flying eagle so now when John
[18:57] gets caught up into the Throne of Throne
[19:00] Room of God in chapter four here he now
[19:02] sees a door in heaven a voice has come
[19:04] up hither he goes up and he sees one
[19:06] sitting on the throne and he starts to
[19:08] describe everything that he sees but
[19:10] round about the throne in the midst of
[19:13] the throne and round about The Throne
[19:14] are these cherubims and one was liken to
[19:17] a lion one liken to an ox one liken to a
[19:21] man and one liken to an eagle and
[19:23] brother bam picks this up in the breach
[19:25] and he says now remember the lion and
[19:27] the ox and so forth the head of the man
[19:29] and so forth and then watch those
[19:31] seraphim the word while all Mark Matthew
[19:34] Luke and John all stood around the book
[19:37] of Acts now brother M's talking about
[19:40] the cherubs around the throne and he
[19:43] ties it to Matthew Mark Luke and John
[19:45] around the book of Acts he makes this
[19:48] parallel and he and he goes on to say
[19:50] further in the breach he says in Matthew
[19:52] markk Luke and John those gospels are
[19:54] standing there guarding that the wisdom
[19:56] of a man the power of the line
[19:58] the work of an ox the swiftness of the
[20:00] lepers or the eagle rather yes the
[20:03] gospel standing there remember when we
[20:05] had it in the seven Church ages and
[20:07] brother R he when he preaches the seven
[20:09] Church ages he he talks about this and
[20:11] he goes into it in Revelation chapter 4
[20:13] and Revelation chapter 5 back in 1960
[20:15] and 61 when he preaches it but what he
[20:17] begins to show is that around the Throne
[20:20] of God are these four living creatures
[20:23] and you can pick it up in Ezekiel and
[20:25] Ezekiel they have the same cherubims and
[20:27] these cherubims eat had four faces and
[20:29] they each had whichever way they looked
[20:31] they had a face of a lion face of an ox
[20:33] face of a man and face of an eagle and
[20:35] brother R ties it to the cherubims all
[20:38] the way back on the Eastern Gate of Eden
[20:40] when God had to move the man out of Eden
[20:43] because he had fallen in sin and he put
[20:45] cherubims there with a flaming sword
[20:47] turning Every Which away to keep the way
[20:49] of the tree of life amen and those were
[20:51] cherubs and brother Ram ties those
[20:53] cherubs to the ones in Ezekiel to the
[20:55] ones in Revelation 4 amen so we see
[20:58] there's four and brother BR shows that
[21:00] the those four living creatures were
[21:02] four anointings that were over the
[21:04] church through the seven Church ages
[21:07] amen when the apostles came out
[21:09] preaching come out in Pentecost and the
[21:11] Apostle Paul came out to establish the
[21:13] word they were under a lion anointing
[21:15] they stood against the face of all
[21:17] opposition with boldness and they boldly
[21:19] proclaimed the word and the Word was
[21:21] written down and we got the New
[21:22] Testament amen but then after that we
[21:25] would have a change in the horse rider
[21:27] from the white horse rider of deception
[21:29] that lion anointing was fighting that
[21:31] deception with the true word but then it
[21:33] would come amen into a red horse that
[21:35] would begin to fight and as it would
[21:37] take up the sword and begin the fight
[21:38] there was an ox anointing that came to
[21:40] the church amen and they would become
[21:42] Martyrs and they would lay down their
[21:43] life for the
[21:45] word these are this these are four
[21:47] anointings over the church amen and so
[21:50] then amen as we would move into the Dark
[21:53] Ages and the black horse would begin to
[21:55] ride and he had stomped out everything
[21:57] and brought everything everything into a
[21:59] a a Dark Age amen God would raise up the
[22:02] man anointing which is intelligence and
[22:04] wisdom amen and he would start to print
[22:06] the word and start to translate the word
[22:08] and start to bring the word back through
[22:11] the man anointing amen and that man
[22:13] anointing was the anointing over the
[22:15] reformers it was over the Lutheran age
[22:17] the wesleyian age and the Pentecostal
[22:19] age amen but at the end of the
[22:21] Pentecostal age there was going to be an
[22:23] eagle anointing that would come and the
[22:25] eagle anointing is the prophetic
[22:27] anointing cuz it can fly high and see
[22:29] far off and these are the anointings
[22:31] over the church age and brother brandham
[22:33] shows them around the Throne of God
[22:35] because the Throne of God is where the
[22:37] life is because God is the
[22:39] life amen so they were guarding the
[22:43] throne and he takes us back I mean all
[22:46] the way back to the Tabernacle in the
[22:48] wilderness and when God would set up the
[22:50] children of Israel to Camp around that
[22:52] amen each of those tribes would have a
[22:54] standard that standard was their flag on
[22:56] the flag would be a symbol and they
[22:58] would have four main four main camps or
[23:02] tribes around and with them was an other
[23:05] two associated with or another three
[23:06] associated with
[23:08] them right right no another two there
[23:10] was three to make 12 I think I got it so
[23:15] around each of them was the standard of
[23:17] Judah the
[23:19] lion the ox the man and Dan the
[23:23] eagle with the camping with the
[23:25] standards around the Throne of God which
[23:28] was in the Tabernacle was the lion ox
[23:30] man and Eagle in heaven around the
[23:32] throne was the lion ox man and Eagle
[23:35] amen guarding the way to the tree of
[23:37] life amen this all has to do with the
[23:39] Tree of Life this all has to do with
[23:41] life guarding the keeping the way to the
[23:43] tree of life was the cherubims with the
[23:45] four faces the four anointings what were
[23:47] the four anointings doing it it at first
[23:49] we used to think through the church ages
[23:51] that those cherums were there keeping
[23:53] them away from the Tree of Life but
[23:55] that's not what the scripture says they
[23:57] were keeping the way of the Tree of Life
[24:00] they were preserving a way back to life
[24:02] they were making sure the path stayed
[24:04] open amen and those four anointings amen
[24:08] now brother bam said are the four
[24:10] gospels amen around the book of
[24:14] Acts because what is the book of Acts he
[24:16] said the book of Acts amen is when amen
[24:20] is when Christ came to his throne where
[24:22] was the throne in the book of Acts the
[24:24] throne came into the heart of man he
[24:26] said when did it come into the heart man
[24:28] at the day of
[24:29] Pentecost so now the Throne of God in
[24:32] Acts amen was the day of Pentecost when
[24:34] when Christ came into the heart of man
[24:36] and what was keeping the way or guarding
[24:38] the way or leading the way to the throne
[24:41] it was those four
[24:42] gospels you pass through the four
[24:45] gospels then you come to the book of
[24:49] Acts amen amen more puzzle
[24:53] pieces so now brother bam takes those
[24:57] four go gospels and puts an anointing
[24:59] upon
[25:00] each and showing on the Book of Matthew
[25:03] is the lion anointing the king anointing
[25:06] and when you read Matthew you can see it
[25:07] so easily you open it up and it starts
[25:09] with the lineage of the House of David
[25:13] amen showing here comes the king through
[25:15] the lineage of the House of David and it
[25:17] starts right in the beginning there's a
[25:18] lion anointing you go to the Book of
[25:20] Mark and Mark is talking about the Lamb
[25:22] of God sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice you
[25:24] come to Luke Luke was the physician he
[25:26] was the intellect he was the Gentile and
[25:28] when you go to Luke Luke starts breaking
[25:30] down all the scientific facts between
[25:32] who married who and how the baby came
[25:34] and the angel and what it say and he
[25:36] puts all the pieces together even the
[25:39] way the book book of Luke starts it
[25:40] doesn't start like the other ones
[25:42] Matthew starts with a lineage because
[25:44] it's the book of the king amen it's the
[25:45] lion book uh Mark starts right Mark is
[25:48] so simple like an ox it starts right
[25:50] into the Gospel of Jesus Christ there
[25:51] was a man named John yeah but Luke is
[25:55] Luke writing to somebody oh the
[25:57] awfulness I have set down to record
[25:59] these things that we know to hold to be
[26:01] true so
[26:02] that it's the man anointing you can see
[26:05] it right from the beginning but when you
[26:07] get to John John doesn't talk about John
[26:10] the Baptist he's not talk about
[26:11] Zacharias he doesn't do a lineage John
[26:13] says in the beginning was the word he
[26:15] goes all the way back before there was
[26:18] an earth before there was any creation
[26:21] and because it's an eagle anointing it's
[26:23] flying so much higher than everything
[26:25] else from that perspective he goes all
[26:27] the way back in the beginning was the
[26:29] word and the Word was with God and the
[26:30] Word was God in him was life and that
[26:34] life was the light of
[26:36] men oh praise God I'm so glad we had a
[26:39] prophet the prophet he takes everything
[26:41] and he put this is why I'm saying when
[26:43] you look at the message and you look at
[26:44] the Bible amen I'm telling you there's a
[26:47] thousand puzzle pieces there may be
[26:50] 10,000 puzzle pieces he talks about
[26:52] cherubs and Eden he talks about the
[26:54] Ezekiel cherubs he talks about the
[26:56] heaven he talks about the go Els he
[26:58] talks about the book of Acts he talks
[26:59] about a throne in heaven he talks about
[27:01] a throne in the heart and it's like what
[27:03] are all these pieces amen but all by the
[27:05] grace of God if he can take everything
[27:07] the prophet said and everything's in the
[27:08] scripture and put it together it makes
[27:10] one picture and it's a beautiful
[27:13] picture and here we come the last gospel
[27:17] the fourth
[27:19] gospel matches the fourth
[27:24] Beast which is the
[27:26] eagle
[27:28] and that book of John is so unlike the
[27:30] other three
[27:31] gospels it's so unique in so many ways
[27:36] that brother BM said he said somebody
[27:39] accused him said brother BM you sure
[27:40] read out of St John a
[27:43] lot I wonder
[27:47] why we were under the eagle
[27:50] anointing and so now when we look at
[27:54] John John's the Apostle of love
[27:59] his Epistles are the Epistle of Love
[28:02] brother brandham said the Book of John
[28:03] is a book of love but he also says it's
[28:07] the eagle anointing it's the eagle
[28:09] anointing on that book so when we look
[28:11] at John who's also a type of the Bride
[28:14] you've got to tie in the love the book
[28:16] of love with the eagle anointing and
[28:19] attach those two
[28:20] together and I hope we can find
[28:22] ourselves
[28:25] there now let's go to Revelation chapter
[28:30] 1 and look
[28:40] here in Revelation 1 verse1 the
[28:44] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[28:46] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[28:48] things which must shortly come to pass
[28:51] and he sent and signified by his by his
[28:53] Angel unto his servant John who bear
[28:57] record of of the word of God and of the
[28:58] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[29:00] things that he saw so we start right off
[29:04] with the Book of Revelation The Book of
[29:06] Revelation is the Capstone of the whole
[29:08] Bible and it's a revelation of Jesus
[29:12] Christ and brother Benham said this
[29:14] whole book is the record of
[29:16] Christ So This Book of Revelation is an
[29:20] unveiling of the entire Bible and it's
[29:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ because
[29:25] the whole book was about Christ it's the
[29:27] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[29:29] gave him to show unto his servants
[29:31] things which must shortly come to pass
[29:33] what do you mean shortly come to pass
[29:34] because this was written 2,000 years ago
[29:36] but you have to realize it was shortly
[29:39] come to pass from the time it was
[29:41] revealed which was in our
[29:44] age and he sent and signify it by his
[29:46] Angel unto his servant John I wonder who
[29:49] that angel represents which Angel cames
[29:51] and brings the revelation of Jesus
[29:53] Christ to John the type of the Bride we
[29:56] know that that's brother ROM amen so we
[29:59] find ourselves in the scriptures and
[30:01] then we see that then we go into chapter
[30:04] 1 and and we we see a description of of
[30:07] Christ in the midst of the seven
[30:08] churches which are the seven Church ages
[30:10] so it's Christ through the seven Church
[30:12] ages in the midst of his church amen and
[30:15] then we go to to Revelation Chapter 2
[30:17] and chapter 3 is a description of the
[30:19] seven Church ages coming down through
[30:21] time but at the end of the seven Church
[30:23] ages we go to Revelation chap 4 it's
[30:26] amazing it's another four again just
[30:30] like the fourth beast and just like the
[30:31] fourth gospel the fourth gospel is John
[30:34] the Fourth Beast is an eagle and the
[30:36] fourth chapter is a catching
[30:39] up for a greater Revelation not the
[30:42] Earthly things now now the Heavenly
[30:44] things and he says in John chap 4:1
[30:47] after this brother BM says after what
[30:49] after these Church ages amen and brother
[30:53] later brother is going to tell us and
[30:54] before the tribulation so this is going
[30:56] to take place place at the end of the
[30:58] church ages and before the tribulation
[31:00] happens to be exactly where we're
[31:01] standing right
[31:03] now said after this I looked and behold
[31:06] a door was open in heaven and the first
[31:08] voice which I heard was it as it were of
[31:10] the trumpet talking with me which said
[31:12] come up hither and I will show thee
[31:14] things which must be Hereafter and I
[31:16] immediately was in the spirit and behold
[31:18] a throne was in heaven and one sat on
[31:20] the throne amen so now brother B says in
[31:25] Revelation chapter 1 from 1960
[31:27] or I'm sorry Revelation chapter 4 said
[31:30] oh notice John being taken up
[31:32] immediately after the church age was a
[31:34] type of the Rapture Church immediately
[31:36] after the church age is over this Leota
[31:38] Church age then comes the Rapture the
[31:40] church goes up like John did into the
[31:42] presence of God and then he comes to
[31:45] Revelation chapter 4 uh part two which
[31:48] he preaches uh on January 1st 1961 the
[31:52] other one was January or December 31st
[31:54] so one was New Year's Eve and one was
[31:56] New Year
[31:57] Day 1961 he says there was a living
[32:01] creature what John represented what John
[32:04] represented the entire church was taken
[32:06] up I told you one person here in a
[32:08] vision can represent the entire body of
[32:12] Christ again he says in Revelation
[32:15] chapter 4 this is part one he says now
[32:18] notice he's finished his work in Earth
[32:20] and he on Earth and he took his church
[32:22] and now he sends the Judgment the world
[32:24] rejected him and he sends the Judgment
[32:26] he his church has gone to Glory John
[32:29] there on the aisle of patmas a Revelator
[32:31] to the church has been the type of the
[32:33] church which is lifted up into Glory
[32:36] come up hither so you say he represented
[32:38] the church to everyone that hears this
[32:41] word John represents
[32:44] him that's me I'm going to take that as
[32:47] me to everyone that hears this word John
[32:50] represents him amen John was the
[32:51] represent representative of the blood of
[32:54] Jesus Christ testimony of the word he
[32:56] was a witness of the baptism of the Holy
[32:58] Ghost and a personal fellowship with
[32:59] Christ and he represented the entire
[33:01] church that every man or woman boy or
[33:04] girl that ever believed in Christ except
[33:06] him on the same grounds he'll be
[33:08] summoned someday come up hither he got
[33:11] up before the tribulation remember the
[33:12] tribulation time hasn't set in yet this
[33:15] is being the time setting of the
[33:16] Judgment John is being showed now what's
[33:18] going to take place after the church age
[33:21] see to everyone that hears this word
[33:23] John represents
[33:25] him amen right sir and who is John the
[33:30] Apostle of
[33:32] Love who is John amen John is the one
[33:36] who writes The Gospel under the eagle
[33:38] anointing John is the one who gets
[33:40] caught up into Heavenly places and sees
[33:42] amen John is the one who starts the the
[33:45] the his gospel off within the beginning
[33:47] was the word amen and John is the one
[33:49] who gets caught up in the vision on the
[33:51] aisle of patmas and sees all the way to
[33:53] the end of time he sees from the
[33:54] beginning of time to the end of time
[33:57] amen and everyone that believes this
[33:59] word John represents him amen CU what
[34:01] has God done to the bride in this end
[34:03] time he's lifted her up to see amen all
[34:05] the way back to the mystery in the back
[34:07] part of God's mind from the beginning of
[34:09] time all the way to what's going to
[34:11] unfold in the end time and what's coming
[34:14] after praise
[34:17] God praise be to
[34:21] God
[34:23] Amen and now in The Invisible Union of
[34:26] the bride I I I I don't know how else to
[34:29] do this but just keep throwing out
[34:30] puzzle pieces amen I hope God's starting
[34:32] to lay them in the right place for you
[34:34] yes he says you're The Virtuous bride of
[34:37] Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[34:38] precious virtuous sinless Son of God
[34:40] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[34:43] word that he Washed by the Water of his
[34:45] own blood that became flesh and
[34:47] manifested that he might take you which
[34:50] were predestinated in the bosom of the
[34:52] father before the beginning the same as
[34:54] he was so where did you come from
[34:57] wherever he came from is where you came
[34:58] from you were pre
[35:01] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[35:03] before the beginning the same as he was
[35:07] oh praise God which which other age knew
[35:11] this which other generation understood
[35:13] these things and had this pronounced
[35:14] over them by a prophet and then he goes
[35:16] on to say he was that great attribute of
[35:19] God Called Love so what is Christ Christ
[35:23] is love what is God God is loveen that
[35:27] right that what Paul tells or John tells
[35:29] us in the epistle God is love amen God
[35:32] is love but he also tells us that God is
[35:34] the word so God is the word and God is
[35:36] love and Christ is the word and Christ
[35:40] is the attribute of God Called
[35:43] Love and then Christ's bride came from
[35:46] the bosom of the Father the same place
[35:48] by predestination that Christ came from
[35:51] and John is a type of her and he's the
[35:52] Apostle of love so what do you think we
[35:54] are we're part of that great love and
[35:57] that great love relationship and that
[35:58] great expression of the attribute of
[36:00] God's love that's what this whole drama
[36:02] is unfolding to show God's
[36:05] love amen so now let's go to John
[36:09] 13
[36:13] together oh there's so many things that
[36:16] I want to get into and I don't know how
[36:18] God help us
[36:22] please now we're looking I want you to
[36:25] recognize we're reading out of St John
[36:27] so so when we read this I want us to
[36:29] understand John's the type of the Bride
[36:31] John's the Apostle of love John has a
[36:33] special relationship with Christ and
[36:35] this book is under an eagle anointing
[36:37] amen amen now look John
[36:44] 13:21 when Jesus had thus said he was
[36:46] troubled in spirit and testified and
[36:48] said this is the last supper this is
[36:49] after he's washed the disciples
[36:51] feet testified and said verily verily I
[36:54] say unto you that one of you shall
[36:56] betray me
[36:57] then the disciples looked one on another
[36:59] doubting of whom he spake now there was
[37:02] leaning on jesus' bosom one of his
[37:04] disciples whom Jesus
[37:07] loved you want to guess who that
[37:09] was we all know because brother bam
[37:12] tells us and the gospels tell us that
[37:14] this is
[37:15] John John the youngest of the Apostles
[37:17] John that will outlive all the apostles
[37:19] John who will get caught up in the
[37:21] Revelation and see the end time John who
[37:23] will understand the mystery of those
[37:25] seven Thunders amen you see how John's
[37:27] the type of the Bride you see how you
[37:29] amen can find your identification in
[37:31] John and here is that same John who will
[37:34] receive the revelation of the seven
[37:35] Thunders see from the beginning in the
[37:38] beginning was the word all the way to
[37:39] the end this same John where is he in
[37:42] the last supper he's laying on the bosom
[37:44] of Jesus what a relationship that this
[37:47] John has to Christ it's unlike any of
[37:49] the other disciples and he has a title
[37:52] that none of the other disciples have
[37:54] and that title is he whom Jesus loved
[37:58] and we'll find it all through the Book
[37:59] of John that's the title that is given
[38:01] to John says now let's read it again now
[38:04] there was leaning on jesus' bosom one of
[38:06] his disciples whom Jesus loved Simon
[38:09] Peter therefore beckoned to him that he
[38:12] should ask who it would be of whom he
[38:15] spake now Peter is not going to say h
[38:19] Jesus who is it no he goes to the one
[38:21] with the special relationship one that's
[38:24] closest Peter amen Peter brother B said
[38:27] Peter is Faith John is love amen he said
[38:30] Peter was burly with faith and he was
[38:31] bold and he was out there amen but is
[38:33] Burly and bold as he was out there with
[38:35] his faith he knew that it took something
[38:37] else to get this divine revelation this
[38:40] hidden secret amen and so he would he
[38:43] would motion to love because brother
[38:45] Braham said Faith worketh by love so
[38:47] here is Faith and he's calling to the
[38:49] one whom the Lord loveth and he says
[38:51] would you whom the Lord loveth with love
[38:53] would you with love ask him who it is
[38:58] amen when we climb this ladder of the
[39:00] Statue of a perfect man what is the goal
[39:02] what are we trying to get to what is the
[39:04] Capstone it's charity it's love and and
[39:07] and love i' say it like this love is not
[39:10] a virtue love is a person the attribute
[39:12] of love the person of God the person of
[39:14] Christ amen whom the bride came out of
[39:18] his
[39:19] [Music]
[39:21] bosom it's it's
[39:24] not if I could if I could say it without
[39:27] getting it wrong it's not like acquiring
[39:31] love it's almost like reconnecting with
[39:35] love it's almost like love coming back
[39:38] together
[39:43] amen
[39:45] amen so now
[39:47] Jesus he laid in jesus' bosom one of the
[39:50] disciples Simon Peter therefore beckoned
[39:53] unto him
[39:54] hey yeah
[39:57] asking that he should ask who it who it
[40:00] should be of whom he spake he then lying
[40:04] on jesus' breast saith unto him Lord who
[40:07] is
[40:09] it Jesus answered he it is to whom I
[40:12] shall give a soop when I have dipped it
[40:15] and when he had dipped the soop he gave
[40:16] it to judas's scariot the son of Simon
[40:19] and after the soop Satan entered into
[40:21] him then said Jesus unto him that thou
[40:23] doest do quickly
[40:29] what did what did John receive he
[40:33] received a private Revelation from Jesus
[40:35] Christ amen yeah amen that the other
[40:39] disciples didn't because it said the
[40:41] when he got up and left the other
[40:42] disciples the disciples around the table
[40:44] all wondered why he left and some
[40:46] thought it was to take care of some
[40:47] business and they didn't even know why
[40:49] he left amen but Jesus said one's going
[40:51] to betray me and they all began to be
[40:53] concerned who it would be and Peter says
[40:56] Peter knew John could get it from Jesus
[40:59] how did Peter know
[41:01] that and John who is on the breast of
[41:04] Jesus he's embraced with Jesus he's
[41:07] connected to Jesus he's over the Heart
[41:09] of Jesus and he says who is it and Jesus
[41:12] says whomever I dip the so and hand it
[41:14] to and then he just dipped the so and
[41:16] handed it to Judas amen you know what
[41:19] there's going to be an
[41:20] antichrist and Judas was the Antichrist
[41:23] amen but the Antichrist was right in
[41:25] their midst and nobody knew right in the
[41:27] church amen right in the church was the
[41:29] Antichrist and nobody knew who the
[41:31] Antichrist was but John received the
[41:33] revelation of how to identify the
[41:35] Antichrist and this bride in this day
[41:38] has received the revelation of how to
[41:40] identify the Antichrist and everybody
[41:42] was confused about Judas but this this
[41:45] John was not confused about Judas
[41:48] because he had received the key to
[41:50] understanding who the Antichrist was not
[41:53] the name it's this one and this one but
[41:55] the key to understand and this bride has
[41:57] been given the key to
[41:59] understand Judas would eventually reveal
[42:02] himself is that true and after he
[42:04] betrayed the the Lord with a kiss they
[42:06] all then knew who the Antichrist was but
[42:08] there was one who got a key before he
[42:11] declared himself amen and we know that
[42:13] this Antichrist is going to Incarnate in
[42:15] a pope and he's going to he he is going
[42:17] to declare himself but before he
[42:19] declared himself there's already one on
[42:21] the bosom of Jesus who's already been
[42:23] told who that Antichrist is
[42:26] amen
[42:28] why because of
[42:32] love what Peter couldn't get John could
[42:36] amen why because of love amen
[42:41] amen praise be to God brother B says in
[42:45] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[42:47] but God's great mystery what the Eternal
[42:49] God has had as a mystery has now been
[42:51] unfolded in Jesus Christ and given right
[42:53] down to his church what was once God
[42:56] God's God's mind is now in the body of
[42:58] Christ Jesus making love to the church
[43:01] his bride Whispering secrets to her amen
[43:05] what is she she's in the relationship
[43:07] like John was yeah you know how you tell
[43:10] your wife things you know the little
[43:11] girl you're going to marry you love her
[43:13] so much you just tell her the secrets
[43:14] and get her up next to
[43:17] you and love you and everything you know
[43:20] how it is that's what God Christ is
[43:23] doing to the church he's letting her
[43:25] know the Secrets just the secrets not
[43:27] these flirters I mean his wife all right
[43:30] now look by having the revelation of his
[43:32] secret made known to them by his grace
[43:35] how the grace of God how is God now
[43:39] taking this little bride this little
[43:41] wife and he's taking her up next to him
[43:43] up close to himself he's embracing her
[43:45] and he's Whispering the love Secrets
[43:47] Earth not the flirters they don't get
[43:48] anything amen but this one that's the
[43:51] that that's the the recipient of his
[43:53] love and he says how is it coming how is
[43:55] this all coming by his
[43:58] grace and brother BM tells us in the in
[44:00] the message titled the message of Grace
[44:02] he said think of it love and grace is
[44:06] sisters twin
[44:08] sisters you can't have Grace without
[44:11] having love so what is it that this
[44:13] great grace and favor that God now wants
[44:15] to whisper the love what where does it
[44:17] come from it's his love expressed it's
[44:20] his love his grace is his love so why is
[44:23] he Whispering the secrets because of
[44:25] love
[44:26] yeah you can't have Grace without having
[44:29] love they're twin sisters that's exactly
[44:32] right before you can have Grace you have
[44:33] to have love before you can actually
[44:35] show somebody a favor you you love them
[44:38] right or wrong you have to love them
[44:40] anyhow or you can't see so love and
[44:42] grace is the same thing they're just
[44:44] twin sisters love and grace so if if you
[44:48] believe you're the recipient of his
[44:49] grace you are the object of his love
[44:53] because love and grace is Twin Sisters
[44:55] you can't have Grace without first
[44:56] having
[44:58] love so how is it he's Whispering these
[45:01] love Secrets by his grace because of his
[45:05] love why because John was the one whom
[45:07] the Lord loved and he got the
[45:11] secret again in Christ is the mystery
[45:13] God revealed he said but his mystery is
[45:16] only revealed to his beloved bride
[45:20] that's the only one could see
[45:22] it this mystery is only revealed to one
[45:26] yeah and that's his beloved bride amen
[45:28] she is what the object of his love She's
[45:31] the recipient of his
[45:33] grace that's why for
[45:36] me we can say you know once we once
[45:39] we're able to realize that God has given
[45:42] me a revelation of this messag amen all
[45:46] of a
[45:47] sudden every fear and anxiety and every
[45:50] worry should vanish out of the window
[45:52] because nobody else receives this this
[45:54] is a special relationship this is Grace
[45:56] that's based on love and it only comes
[45:58] to the whom the Lord beloved it's only
[46:01] the whom the Lord love only those who
[46:03] are drawn up close to the Lord and lying
[46:05] on his breast are the only ones that get
[46:07] these
[46:08] secrets and if all of a sudden he's
[46:10] going to reveal these secrets to you and
[46:12] your heart is going to open and you're
[46:14] going to say I don't know that I can
[46:15] intellectually understand it but
[46:17] something in my heart is exploding right
[46:19] now that I know that what that Prophet
[46:21] is teaching is nothing but the truth
[46:23] amen and all of a sudden you realize you
[46:25] should realize you're a recipient of
[46:28] that Grace that only the bride gets
[46:30] these love Seekers this Revelation is
[46:32] only given to one girl it's not given to
[46:34] the flirters it's not given to the rest
[46:36] of the town it's only given to one and
[46:38] it's the one that he's drawing up close
[46:40] and Whispering the secret that's the one
[46:42] he
[46:43] [Music]
[46:45] loves praise God I want to I want to
[46:48] look at this in the Book of John so if
[46:50] you could just bear with me I want to go
[46:52] through a little quick Bible study if I
[46:53] can amen and let's let's look at Matthew
[46:57] let's turn to Matthew we're going to go
[46:59] we're going to go Matthew Mark John
[47:01] Matthew Mark Luke John we're going to
[47:04] pass through those and I want to look
[47:05] because I want to I want to show you the
[47:07] same story told it in three different
[47:10] places and I want you to see how the
[47:13] Revelation is different to
[47:15] John so Matthew 26 let's start
[47:22] there Matthew
[47:24] 26 verse 6 so Matthew 26 and6 now when
[47:29] Jesus was in Bethany in the house of
[47:31] Simon the leper there came unto him a
[47:33] woman having an albaster box very
[47:35] precious ointment and poured it on his
[47:37] head as he sat at meat but when his
[47:40] disciples saw it they had indignation
[47:42] saying to what purpose is this waste for
[47:45] this ointment might have been sold for
[47:46] much and given to the poor so this is
[47:49] the principle this is the story where
[47:51] this woman anoints Jesus with this
[47:53] fragrance and and they think it's a
[47:55] waste so let's pick the story up now in
[47:58] Mark Mark
[48:00] 14 it's going to be the same exact
[48:03] story Mark
[48:05] 14 and verse
[48:08] three and being in Bethany in the house
[48:10] of Simon the leper as he sat at meat
[48:12] there came a woman having an alabaster
[48:14] box of ointment of nerd very
[48:16] precious and she break the box and P it
[48:19] on his head and there were some that had
[48:21] indignation within themselves and said
[48:24] why has this waste of this ointment made
[48:27] for it might have been sold for more
[48:28] than 300 p and have been given to the
[48:30] poor and they murmured against
[48:32] her got it same story let's go to John
[48:42] 12 John chapter 12 and let's look at
[48:46] verse
[48:50] one then Jesus 6 days before the
[48:53] Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus
[48:55] was which had been dead whom he raised
[48:57] from the dead and there there they made
[48:59] him a supper and Martha sred but Lazarus
[49:01] was one of them that sat at the table
[49:03] with him then took Mary a pound of
[49:05] ointment of spikner very costly and
[49:07] anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his
[49:09] feet with her hair and the house was
[49:10] filled with the odor of the ointment
[49:12] then said one of his disciples Judas a
[49:15] scariot Simon's son which would betray
[49:18] him why was not this ointment sold for
[49:20] 300 p and given to the poor this he said
[49:23] not that he cared for the poor but
[49:24] because he was a th and had the bag and
[49:27] bear what was put there in same story
[49:29] told three times what's the difference
[49:31] the difference is John has a special
[49:33] Revelation where everybody else knows
[49:35] somebody said something but who is it
[49:37] that said it when he come under the
[49:39] eagle anointing amen the one he loves he
[49:41] said it was Judas the
[49:43] scariot there's no more mystery of who
[49:46] this mysterious group is or who this
[49:47] mysterious person is and when we get
[49:49] into the seals now there's no more
[49:51] mystery of who the souls under the altar
[49:53] are we know that they're Jews who are
[49:55] these 144,000 in Revelation 7 who are
[49:57] these white robed ones who are these two
[49:59] witnesses amen John under the eagle
[50:02] anointing the one who the lord loves he
[50:04] gets the special Revelation and when
[50:06] nobody else gets the name he gets the
[50:09] names who's in Revelations 11 everybody
[50:12] argues but the bride knows it's Moses
[50:14] and Elijah amen who's this that's under
[50:17] the altar crying out how long oh Lord
[50:19] and the white robes were given they're
[50:20] the Jews amen amen from the time of
[50:23] Christ all the way through they're the
[50:24] Jews amen praise God Amen in every other
[50:30] age under every other anointing it's a
[50:33] Myster mystery yeah there was somebody
[50:35] who said this yeah there's somebody
[50:36] under the altar yeah Somebody's Crying
[50:38] Out yeah there's two witnesses yeah
[50:40] they're there we know they're there but
[50:41] who were they it's John who knows who
[50:43] they were cuz it's the bride who knows
[50:45] who it
[50:48] is praise be to
[50:52] God why oh my goodness
[50:56] brother B says in the fourth seal now
[50:58] when the lamb had opened the fourth seal
[51:01] sto there and there on the fourth seal
[51:02] now who opened at the lamb was anybody
[51:04] else worthy no one else could do it the
[51:06] lamb opened the fourth seal and the
[51:09] fourth Beast the living creature Like an
[51:12] Eagle said to John come see what the
[51:14] fourth mystery of the Plan of Redemption
[51:16] has been hid in the book cuz the lamb is
[51:19] open and in other words what he was
[51:20] saying here's the fourth mystery here
[51:23] and if we go to revelation 6: seven I'll
[51:25] just read it to you says and when he
[51:27] opened the fourth seal I heard the voice
[51:29] of the fourth Beast what's that
[51:32] eagle come and said come and see and I
[51:35] looked and behold a Pale Horse and his
[51:36] name that sat on him was death and Hell
[51:39] Followed after him amen what's so
[51:41] significant about this because under the
[51:43] other anointings there was other horse
[51:45] riders amen but it never tells you who
[51:48] the horse rider is a white Rider went on
[51:51] a white horse one went on a red horse
[51:53] one went on a black but under the eagle
[51:55] anointing he gets a name and his name is
[51:57] death and Hell follows after him why
[51:59] because it's under the eagle anointing
[52:01] now what was laying there as a mystery
[52:03] is now
[52:05] unveiled they knew there was a horse
[52:08] rider but it looked like could it be
[52:09] three different Riders amen a rider on a
[52:12] white than a rer no but under the eagle
[52:14] anointing the prophet comes say it's
[52:16] been the same Rider all along and it's
[52:18] the Antichrist and he's moved from White
[52:20] Horse to Red Horse he got off the red
[52:22] horse got on the Black Horse and he got
[52:23] off the black horse on the peir horse
[52:25] but under the ministry of the fourth
[52:27] Beast under the anointing the the Holy
[52:30] Ghost anointing over the church through
[52:32] a prophetic Ministry which is Eagle
[52:34] anointing he now tells you who this has
[52:37] been all through the church ages what
[52:39] Matthew couldn't tell you what Mark
[52:41] couldn't tell you what Luke couldn't
[52:42] tell you now under the eagle anointing
[52:44] under the ministry of John the bride now
[52:47] you can know it's Judas a scari he's the
[52:49] Antichrist he's the horse rider he's
[52:52] also the one that will portray Jesus
[52:54] betray Jesus
[52:56] Christ amen I hope we're not just seeing
[52:59] John I hope we're seeing
[53:03] ourselves let's go back to Matthew 26
[53:06] let's do this one more time because it's
[53:11] fun you know when brother B says when he
[53:14] opened those seals he opened the entire
[53:17] Bible right it's going to take us the
[53:20] rest of our time on this planet to keep
[53:22] unlocking what was opened under the
[53:24] opening of those seals and I don't think
[53:26] we're going to come to the end of it I
[53:27] think we're going to still be
[53:28] discovering as we move
[53:31] on Matthew 26 verse
[53:38] 50 this is Jesus when they come to
[53:41] arrest him in the Garden of Gethsemane
[53:43] verse 50 says and Jesus said unto him
[53:44] friend wherefore art thou come then came
[53:48] they and laid hands on Jesus and took
[53:49] him behold one of them which were with
[53:52] Jesus stretched out his hand and Drew
[53:53] his sword and struck a servant of the
[53:55] high priest and smote off his
[53:58] ear somebody cut off somebody's ear now
[54:02] we know it was somebody that was with
[54:04] Jesus and somebody that was a high
[54:05] priest servant that's all we know let's
[54:08] go to Mark
[54:14] 14 so we went from Lion now we're under
[54:16] the ox anointing we're moving through
[54:19] the church
[54:22] ages Mark 14 verse
[54:26] 46 Mark 14 and
[54:29] 46 and they laid their hands on him and
[54:32] took him and one of them that stood by
[54:34] Drew a sword and smote a servant of the
[54:35] high priest and cut off his
[54:38] ear it's Ox anointing let's go to
[54:41] Luke Luke
[54:48] 22 Luke
[54:54] 22:48 but Jesus said unto him Judas
[54:58] betray us thou the son of man with a
[54:59] kiss when they which were about him saw
[55:02] what would follow they said unto him
[55:04] Lord shall we Smite with the sword and
[55:06] one of them smote the servant of the
[55:07] high priest and cut off his
[55:09] ear it seems like through the church
[55:12] ages we keep getting the same
[55:14] information on the
[55:17] seals we know there's characters we know
[55:21] there's actors we know something about
[55:24] them we know some information one that
[55:26] was with Jesus and one that was among
[55:28] them and one that came and one was a
[55:29] servant of the high priest and we know
[55:31] that there was a sword and we know he's
[55:32] got his ear cut we know we know the
[55:34] symbols we know all this information but
[55:36] we don't know who it was but let's go to
[55:39] John now John chapter 20 I'm sorry John
[55:43] chapter
[55:46] 18 John chapter
[55:49] 18 and verse
[55:51] 10 then Simon Peter having a sword drew
[55:54] it and smokee the high priest servant
[55:56] and cut off his right ear the servant's
[55:58] name was
[56:02] malcus amen not through the church ages
[56:05] but under the eagle anointing amen under
[56:08] John John got the Revelation John
[56:11] declared the Revelation the the book
[56:13] that's the Book of Love brother B said
[56:16] this is the St John this is the gospel
[56:18] of love and he's he wrote the Epistles
[56:21] of love and he's the Apostle of love the
[56:23] disciple of love the recipient of love
[56:26] the one whom God loved and this book is
[56:28] under an eagle anointing brothers and
[56:30] sisters this is where we're at this is
[56:32] who we are this is identifying what age
[56:34] we're in and who we
[56:36] are now we know it's Moses and
[56:41] Elijah that'll take the gospel to and
[56:43] and it will be after the church is
[56:45] caught away and we know who the church
[56:47] is amen they're the ones that receive
[56:49] this love secret nobody else but only
[56:52] the bride will receive this love secret
[56:54] of the revelation of the Seven Seals and
[56:55] the Mystery of God being finished she's
[56:57] the one who's going to take the Rapture
[56:59] now all the rest of them who rejected or
[57:01] never had a chance to hear they're going
[57:03] to remain who's going to go in the
[57:04] Rapture who's going to go in Tribulation
[57:06] we know we can name them Mrs Jesus
[57:08] Christ is going up bride's going up
[57:10] church is staying we now can name it we
[57:13] can separate it we know who the false
[57:15] Vine is we know who the True Vine is we
[57:18] know who the souls under the altar are
[57:20] we know who the 144,000 are we know who
[57:22] the white robed ones in Revelation I
[57:25] mean my goodness it's so clear to me
[57:30] now no wonder brother Brenham was always
[57:32] reading out of St
[57:37] John oh praise God let's go to John
[57:40] chapter 20 now now can you identify with
[57:45] John let's let's
[57:49] look John chapter 20 verse
[57:53] one the first first day of the week
[57:55] cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was
[57:57] yet dark unto the sepil and seeth a
[57:59] stone taken away from the Seiler then
[58:02] she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter
[58:04] and to the other disciple whom Jesus
[58:06] loved who's that that's
[58:09] John the type of the
[58:11] bride and saith unto them they they have
[58:15] taken away the Lord out of the separer
[58:17] and we know not where they have laid him
[58:20] Peter therefore went forth and that
[58:22] other disciple that the Mystic ious one
[58:26] cuz the bride's been the mystery all the
[58:28] way through the
[58:30] book amen and that other disciple and
[58:33] came to the Seiler so they ran both
[58:35] together and the other disciple did
[58:37] outrun Peter and came first to the
[58:39] Seiler and he stooped down and looked in
[58:41] and saw the linen clothes lying yet went
[58:43] he not in then cometh Simon Peter
[58:46] following him and went into the Seiler
[58:48] and seeth the linen clothes and the
[58:50] napkin that was about his head not lying
[58:52] with the linen clothes but wrapped
[58:53] together in a place by itself then went
[58:56] in also the other disciple which came
[58:58] first to the Seiler and he saw and
[59:02] believed amen for as yet they knew not
[59:05] the scriptures that he must Rise Again
[59:08] from the
[59:10] dead before they even realized or
[59:13] remember the scri scriptures they rise
[59:14] from the dead as soon as John who's a
[59:17] type of the Bride who's the Apostle of
[59:20] Love who's a special relationship with
[59:21] Jesus who's under an eagle anointing as
[59:24] soon as he steps in and he sees the
[59:26] napkin he sees the clothes Peter saw it
[59:28] it doesn't tell us what Peter thought
[59:29] but Peter went away but we know he
[59:31] doubted because he was unbraided by the
[59:32] Lord for his unbelief but when Peter
[59:34] looked in it said he believed he
[59:37] believed why there was something special
[59:39] in him that could believe just upon
[59:41] seeing the empty
[59:45] seple he didn't need he didn't need like
[59:47] Thomas to touch this the the the prince
[59:50] in his hand and thrust his hand into his
[59:52] side when he saw that Seer he believed
[59:57] belied
[59:58] amen why I'll tell you why cuz Faith
[1:00:01] worketh by love he was the recipient of
[1:00:04] love he was the special object of Love
[1:00:06] which gave him a special Grace and he
[1:00:08] believed because Faith worketh by
[1:00:11] love God we love him because he first
[1:00:15] loved us it's reciprocating his grace is
[1:00:19] bestowed upon us because he loved
[1:00:21] us we have the capacity to receive the
[1:00:25] truth by grac and Grace is love am we're
[1:00:30] in that special relationship with Christ
[1:00:33] let's go to Revelation
[1:00:38] 21 Revelation 21 verse
[1:00:43] three Simon Peter saith unto them I'm
[1:00:47] sorry John 21 what did I
[1:00:50] say to me John and Revelation about the
[1:00:53] same thing anyhow anymore it's all
[1:00:55] coming together as one let's go sorry
[1:00:57] John 21 I turned the page once and I
[1:01:01] heard a lot of turning I said something
[1:01:02] is bad wrong these folks have big Bibles
[1:01:05] with big
[1:01:07] print John 21 verse three Simon Peter
[1:01:12] saith unto them I go fishing they say
[1:01:15] unto them we also go with thee they went
[1:01:17] forth and entered into a ship
[1:01:18] immediately and that night they caught
[1:01:20] nothing but when the morning was now
[1:01:23] come Jesus stood on the shore
[1:01:25] but the disciples knew not that it was
[1:01:28] Jesus then Jesus said to them children
[1:01:31] have you any meat they answered him no
[1:01:33] and he said unto them cast thy net on
[1:01:35] the right side of the ship and you shall
[1:01:37] find they cast therefore and now they
[1:01:40] were not able to draw it in for the
[1:01:42] multitude of the fishes therefore that
[1:01:45] disciple whom Jesus
[1:01:46] loved amen you see the
[1:01:50] pattern that disciple whom Jesus loves
[1:01:52] saith unto Peter it is the Lord he was
[1:01:56] the first one that could recognize the
[1:01:58] Lord why he was in the he was in a
[1:02:00] Covenant of Grace he was in the
[1:02:02] relationship of love he had laid in the
[1:02:04] bosom of Jesus Amen there's something
[1:02:06] special about John and there's something
[1:02:08] special about the Book of John amen amen
[1:02:12] amen I just personally believe that the
[1:02:15] Gospel of John is the bride's
[1:02:19] gospel
[1:02:21] amen God so let me keep on reading
[1:02:25] cuz this is really interesting therefore
[1:02:27] that disciple whom Jesus loved saith
[1:02:29] unto Peter it was the Lord now when
[1:02:32] Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord
[1:02:34] he G his Fisher's coat unto him for he
[1:02:35] was naked and he did cast himself into
[1:02:37] the
[1:02:38] sea you see Peter has that Burly bold
[1:02:42] Faith that'll just launch out and just
[1:02:43] take it amen but he needs something to
[1:02:47] help that faith and what does he need
[1:02:49] love because Faith worketh by love amen
[1:02:52] this is why this is why Peter and John
[1:02:55] were going to the gate beautiful amen
[1:02:57] one day and and and you know what John
[1:03:00] never speaks when when you see all these
[1:03:02] encounters with Peter and John and Peter
[1:03:04] and John and Peter and John John's
[1:03:06] hardly ever speaking when they go to the
[1:03:07] separer he stands he looks in stands
[1:03:10] back let's Peter go first but after
[1:03:11] Peter he goes down and he sees and he
[1:03:13] believes now when Christ comes on the
[1:03:16] scene here in at the at the lake amen
[1:03:19] now he says it is the Lord and when love
[1:03:21] identifies the Lord Faith goes in action
[1:03:24] and jumps overboard and swims the
[1:03:27] land faith and love Faith worketh by
[1:03:33] love John Peter didn't heal the blind
[1:03:36] man without
[1:03:39] love love love may not have been the
[1:03:41] spokesman that day but love was there
[1:03:43] amen with faith
[1:03:47] amen praise
[1:03:50] God let's go let's look at verse 20 here
[1:03:53] in the the same chapter chapter
[1:03:57] 21:2 and before we read that I want to
[1:04:01] to take you through a little um a little
[1:04:05] discussion that Jesus has with Peter now
[1:04:07] Peter swims to shore I mean Peter
[1:04:10] absolutely loves the Lord but he he
[1:04:12] swims the shore he's a type of Faith he
[1:04:14] comes to the to the land and now Jesus
[1:04:16] starts looking at Peter and he asked
[1:04:18] Peter three times Peter do you love
[1:04:23] me Peter do you love
[1:04:26] me what was it Peter needed what was it
[1:04:29] Peter was missing what was the missing
[1:04:31] ingredient in Peter Peter was bold Peter
[1:04:34] had Faith Peter could take the bull by
[1:04:36] the but what Peter needed was love
[1:04:41] amen after he had had Faith after he
[1:04:44] could receive a revelation amen of who
[1:04:46] the from the father of who Christ was in
[1:04:48] Matthew 16 what did he need he needed
[1:04:51] love and he says now he begins to
[1:04:52] question him Peter do you love
[1:04:54] me and he says Lord you know I love you
[1:04:57] feed my sheep Peter does thou love me
[1:04:59] more than the and he was
[1:05:01] grieved he said you know I love you he
[1:05:03] said feed my
[1:05:05] Lambs he's now beginning to tie Peter
[1:05:08] down by love amen and love will have
[1:05:12] Peter living for others because living
[1:05:16] for others is looking heaven in the
[1:05:18] face serving Christ and his sheep
[1:05:22] serving his people is the expression of
[1:05:25] love and what Peter needed was to come
[1:05:28] in contact with love and be tempered by
[1:05:30] love and be moved by love because Faith
[1:05:33] worketh by
[1:05:35] love Peter had dogmatism he he knew that
[1:05:39] this was I mean even after they all left
[1:05:41] and Jesus says will you go also he says
[1:05:44] uh where to whom shall we go thou alone
[1:05:47] have the word of life and we believe and
[1:05:48] we know that that that thou art the
[1:05:51] Christ the son of the Living God he had
[1:05:53] Faith amen but that Faith was cutting
[1:05:55] people's ears off trying to kill them
[1:05:57] fighting over who was the greatest in
[1:05:58] the Kingdom amen disputing with Jesus
[1:06:01] Christ himself whether or not he'll
[1:06:02] suffer amen Faith was was was doing a
[1:06:05] lot yeah but it needed to be tempered by
[1:06:09] love because Faith worketh by
[1:06:12] love don't you love the word of God
[1:06:16] don't you love the scriptures how uh for
[1:06:19] years these have been separate pieces
[1:06:21] but it's all coming together and
[1:06:22] painting one pie
[1:06:27] picture verse 20 now after Peter goes
[1:06:31] through this
[1:06:32] questioning Jesus tells him when you're
[1:06:35] older you'll go where you don't want
[1:06:36] you'll led by those who lead you where
[1:06:38] you don't want and he starts to talk
[1:06:39] about his crucifixion how he'll die and
[1:06:43] then Peter turning about seeth the
[1:06:44] disciple whom Jesus loved following
[1:06:46] which also leaned on his breast at
[1:06:48] supper we know who that is yes and said
[1:06:52] Lord which is is he that betrayeth thee
[1:06:55] that's the one that we're talking about
[1:06:57] now Peter seeing him saith Jesus Lord
[1:07:00] and what shall this man do and Jesus
[1:07:03] sayto him if I will that he tar till I
[1:07:06] come what is that to thee follow thou
[1:07:09] me why because John's the type of the
[1:07:12] Bride amen he's going to be there till
[1:07:15] the coming of the Lord that's so
[1:07:18] beautiful this scripture has a dual
[1:07:20] purpose a dual meaning and we'll discuss
[1:07:22] that in a meaning but he says if I will
[1:07:24] that he T till I come what is that to
[1:07:26] thee follow thou me then went this
[1:07:28] saying abroad among the Brethren that
[1:07:30] the disciples should not die yet Jesus
[1:07:32] said not unto him he shall not die but
[1:07:35] if I will that he T till I come what is
[1:07:37] that to thee this is the disciple which
[1:07:40] testifieth of these things and wrote
[1:07:44] these things and we know that his
[1:07:47] testimony is true who testified to the
[1:07:51] well look at the top of the page
[1:07:55] John this is the Gospel of John the
[1:07:58] Epistle of John this is the one who
[1:08:00] wrote these things and T and we know
[1:08:02] that his testimony is the truth why
[1:08:05] because he's love he's under the ego
[1:08:07] anointing and he knows the truth amen
[1:08:10] and can testify of the
[1:08:12] truth in Revelation chter 4 brother BM
[1:08:15] said Peter said what are what are what
[1:08:17] are you going to do with him that fellow
[1:08:19] that's going to happen to him he said
[1:08:21] what is it to you if if he sees me
[1:08:24] coming and he let him live to see it
[1:08:27] after the rest of them was dead and gone
[1:08:29] John lived to see the coming of the Lord
[1:08:31] rehearsed in power the whole scene set
[1:08:34] from his time until the judgment is over
[1:08:36] and the Millennium is issued in John saw
[1:08:39] every bit of it and the Millennium over
[1:08:41] and the kingdom age started so he keeps
[1:08:44] his word doesn't
[1:08:46] he amen he says what if I amen and they
[1:08:50] misunderstood it and they made it a
[1:08:52] natural thing and it was going to be a
[1:08:53] spirit spiritual thing and John was
[1:08:55] there Amen on the aisle of patmas and he
[1:08:57] was caught up in the vision he was there
[1:08:59] amen between the church ages and the
[1:09:01] tribulation and their door was open in
[1:09:02] heaven and he heard a voice say come up
[1:09:05] hither and he got he come up higher and
[1:09:07] he saw the lamb take the book he saw the
[1:09:09] seals come off the book he he heard the
[1:09:11] seven Thunders he saw amen the
[1:09:14] tribulation period he saw the Battle of
[1:09:16] armagan he saw the Millennium set and he
[1:09:18] saw the new heavens and new earth
[1:09:21] descend why cuz he's a type of the Bride
[1:09:25] why I'll tell you why oh my
[1:09:29] goodness I got two more scriptures a
[1:09:31] couple more scriptures I want to get
[1:09:36] to oh I want to get to this one let's go
[1:09:38] to this one right now let's go to First
[1:09:41] Corinthians sometimes I just don't know
[1:09:43] how to express it
[1:09:45] all 1 Corinthians
[1:09:52] 13 this is why he says
[1:09:55] this to me this is just the way I catch
[1:09:59] things 1 Corinthians
[1:10:01] 13:1 though I speak with tongues of men
[1:10:04] and angels and have not charity I become
[1:10:06] a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[1:10:09] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[1:10:11] understand all Mysteries and all
[1:10:12] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:10:14] that I can move mountains and have not
[1:10:16] charity I am
[1:10:19] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[1:10:21] to feed the poor and though I give my
[1:10:23] body to be burned and have not charity
[1:10:25] it profiteth me
[1:10:30] nothing everything else will fade away
[1:10:33] but charity is going all the way to the
[1:10:36] end and here is Peter talking Faith
[1:10:40] talking about love where what if he
[1:10:42] endures why because faith is going to
[1:10:45] make it or love is going to make it all
[1:10:47] the way to the end and Faith which
[1:10:48] worketh by love will go all the way to
[1:10:50] the end too but it's going to take Love
[1:10:53] Without Love it's nothing amen but with
[1:10:55] love it will
[1:10:57] endure praise be to God Amen now let's
[1:11:01] turn together to Revelation chapter
[1:11:10] 10 Revelation chap
[1:11:14] 10 and verse 8 this is after John here's
[1:11:19] the seven
[1:11:22] Thunders John has got the revelation of
[1:11:25] the seven Thunders which are the
[1:11:27] Mysteries revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:11:30] and he's already heard it John knows it
[1:11:32] he heard it he was going to write it but
[1:11:34] he was told to seal it up but John has
[1:11:36] already received the revelation of the
[1:11:38] Seven Seals which are the seven
[1:11:41] Thunders and after he got that
[1:11:44] Revelation he hears a Voice verse 8 and
[1:11:48] the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:11:49] spake unto me again and said go and take
[1:11:51] the little book which is open in the
[1:11:53] hand of the the angel which standeth
[1:11:54] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:11:57] went to the angel and I said unto him
[1:11:58] give me the little book and he said unto
[1:12:01] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[1:12:03] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[1:12:06] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:12:09] little book out of the Angel's hand now
[1:12:11] listen this is the same book brother B
[1:12:13] says in Revelations 5 was sealed with
[1:12:15] Seven Seals and no man could touch it
[1:12:18] nor look upon it nor read
[1:12:20] it same book and brother says the book
[1:12:22] of life is it's the title deed of all
[1:12:24] Redemption it's the marriage certificate
[1:12:26] it's the
[1:12:28] Bible it's the revelation of the mystery
[1:12:31] of God that book in Revelation 5 is
[1:12:34] sealed in Revelation 10 the mighty Angel
[1:12:36] comes down with an open book in his hand
[1:12:38] and now John is told to go to that angel
[1:12:40] which brother bandam says is
[1:12:41] Christ to go to that angel and take that
[1:12:44] open book that's been unsealed and not
[1:12:46] just take it but to become one with it
[1:12:49] to eat it to bring it inside of you
[1:12:51] brother B said don't just come this far
[1:12:53] and say I believe the message you take
[1:12:54] the message you take it into you amen
[1:12:57] you feed on it and you become one with
[1:12:59] it and you identify with it and it'll be
[1:13:01] sweet as honey in your mouth why because
[1:13:03] when you receive the revelation of the
[1:13:04] word it's absolutely thrilling but when
[1:13:06] you go to live it it's the same life
[1:13:08] Jesus Christ LED it's rejection and
[1:13:10] Scorn and ridicule and
[1:13:14] misunderstanding but then he says verse
[1:13:17] 10 and I took the little book out of the
[1:13:18] Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was
[1:13:20] in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon
[1:13:22] as I had eaten it my belly was bitter
[1:13:25] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:13:29] again before many peoples and Nations
[1:13:33] tongues and
[1:13:38] Kings prophesy
[1:13:41] again what anointing is John under the
[1:13:46] eagle anointing which is the prophetic
[1:13:49] anointing here's what brother Brenham
[1:13:51] says back in the message as the eagle
[1:13:52] stirs her neck asked said no sir Papa
[1:13:55] Eagle they look just like him they
[1:13:57] believe the same thing he does they look
[1:13:59] like him yes sir they're made like him
[1:14:00] they're built like him and he knows
[1:14:02] they're genuine Eagles oh my that's what
[1:14:04] God wants genuine Messi yes he is
[1:14:09] messiah messiah is the anointed one and
[1:14:11] we are his children which which have a
[1:14:14] lesser anointing as Jehovah Eagle is
[1:14:17] Great Eagle and we're
[1:14:19] eaglets he's Messiah and we with the
[1:14:22] same anoint oting are
[1:14:24] Messi amen anointed Messiah means the
[1:14:27] anointed one are you anointed amen what
[1:14:29] with the same spirit that he is Anointed
[1:14:32] with we have it in measure he has it
[1:14:35] without measure he was God manifest in
[1:14:37] flesh we are sons of God parts of him
[1:14:40] coming
[1:14:41] on what is it take the book take the
[1:14:44] open book take the revealed word take it
[1:14:46] into yourself Beed on it eat it eat it
[1:14:49] all up amen take all of the message in
[1:14:52] and become one with it digest it let it
[1:14:55] become
[1:14:56] you that's what happens to our food our
[1:14:58] food becomes us amen eat it until the
[1:15:01] message becomes us until the message
[1:15:03] starts to manifest in flesh our food
[1:15:06] when you go and eat food that food is
[1:15:07] going to come into a fleshly
[1:15:10] manifestation is that right it's going
[1:15:12] to make cells it's going to make hair
[1:15:13] make blood cells it's going to it's
[1:15:15] going to move your body make Muscle why
[1:15:17] the food is coming the manifestation
[1:15:19] this message has to come to a fleshly
[1:15:21] manifestation but in order for that to
[1:15:23] happen you've got to take the book from
[1:15:25] Christ and you've got to eat it up
[1:15:28] amen amen why and then prophesy again
[1:15:31] why you mean prophesy again this doesn't
[1:15:33] mean that we're all going to have
[1:15:34] prophetic Ministry that means we're
[1:15:36] under a prophetic Ministry we're under
[1:15:38] an eagle anointing and we're going to
[1:15:40] prophesy again means to prophesy what's
[1:15:43] already been prophesied we're just going
[1:15:44] to say what the prophet says amen cuz
[1:15:47] the prophet and the bride and the spirit
[1:15:50] will be saying the same
[1:15:52] thing
[1:15:54] am do you see your ident identification
[1:15:56] with John John's a type of the
[1:15:59] bride and a special relationship with
[1:16:02] the
[1:16:04] Lord now I want to look at just a couple
[1:16:07] things and we're finishing with this
[1:16:10] that brother Brenham said just one this
[1:16:12] this one time he says this he says it
[1:16:14] many times but I just pulled one
[1:16:16] quote he said John after we returned
[1:16:19] from the aisle of patmas out in the aian
[1:16:22] sea only thing he could say was little
[1:16:25] children love one
[1:16:27] another he found there was something
[1:16:31] real what did this
[1:16:34] experience on the patmas island do for
[1:16:37] him what happened on patmas he got the
[1:16:40] Book of Revelation the revelation of
[1:16:43] Jesus Christ was unveiled to him the
[1:16:45] opening of the seals the end time
[1:16:46] Mysteries the events the mystery of God
[1:16:48] fa he got all of it yeah and when he
[1:16:51] came back from that experience
[1:16:54] what was his main
[1:16:55] message
[1:16:57] love little children love one
[1:17:01] another why because God is love and they
[1:17:04] that know God know
[1:17:06] him our
[1:17:09] love he had come into something
[1:17:14] real love brings
[1:17:17] Revelation what brought
[1:17:20] Revelation to John special Revel ation
[1:17:23] none of the other disciples got special
[1:17:25] Revelation in the Book of John that none
[1:17:27] of the other gospels what was that it
[1:17:30] was love because he was the one whom the
[1:17:32] Lord loved amen so love brings
[1:17:35] Revelation because we receive these
[1:17:37] secrets by
[1:17:39] Grace but Revelation brings love God
[1:17:43] because when John came
[1:17:45] back he wrote the Epistles of love the
[1:17:49] most important message that he had was
[1:17:51] the Capstone amen
[1:17:54] charity without love it's
[1:17:58] nothing Faith to move mountains all
[1:18:01] knowledge to understand all Mysteries
[1:18:03] this is what Paul declares but if I have
[1:18:05] not love it is nothing amen John had re
[1:18:09] received the same Revelation he had seen
[1:18:12] he had seen the church ages he had seen
[1:18:13] the coming of the Lord he had seen the
[1:18:15] battle of Armageddon he had seen the
[1:18:17] Millennium he had seen it all and when
[1:18:20] he comes back the main message that he
[1:18:22] preaches
[1:18:23] is just love each other when it's all
[1:18:26] said and done everything have come out
[1:18:29] of that great resource of love and
[1:18:31] everything goes back to that great well
[1:18:33] of love and it's all about
[1:18:38] love love brings Revelation and
[1:18:40] Revelation brings love so I can't seeing
[1:18:44] Revelation bringing
[1:18:46] contention and
[1:18:49] dispute disagreement and
[1:18:51] hostility it didn't do it with
[1:18:55] John amen that's way Peter was when he
[1:18:58] had faith without
[1:19:01] love but Faith worketh by love it wasn't
[1:19:05] that Peter didn't have faith but he had
[1:19:07] to be brought into something else and he
[1:19:09] had to be United with John and him and
[1:19:11] John after the after the uh after the
[1:19:14] resurrection of Jesus Christ in the day
[1:19:16] of Pentecost Peter and John had to work
[1:19:21] together brother br says in the message
[1:19:24] desperations says now the word plainly
[1:19:27] states if you want to put this down in
[1:19:29] Galatians 5:6 that Faith worketh by love
[1:19:33] Faith worketh by love and the only way
[1:19:34] that you can have faith is have love
[1:19:36] first because after all faith is lov's
[1:19:39] incentive incentive that's exactly what
[1:19:42] faith is it's an incentive to love now
[1:19:45] if you don't have love you can't have
[1:19:48] faith what was what was God's
[1:19:51] incentive to do all of this for us
[1:19:55] love what is our incentive to believe
[1:19:58] God and give ourselves love it's a
[1:20:01] reciprocating love amen what brings the
[1:20:05] Revelation to our hearts God's
[1:20:08] love pure and simple it's God's grace
[1:20:11] which Grace is a twin sister to love why
[1:20:13] do you see what you see because of love
[1:20:16] because of his love for you why is the
[1:20:18] book open to you why does the message
[1:20:20] seem to resonate in your heart why don't
[1:20:22] you stumble over why can you accept it
[1:20:25] when thousands can't accept that God
[1:20:26] sent a prophet thousands can't believe
[1:20:28] Millions can't believe that the seals
[1:20:30] are open they can't recognize the coming
[1:20:32] of the Lord why for you it's not a
[1:20:34] problem why because that's his love to
[1:20:36] you that's
[1:20:39] Grace and if you're a recipient of that
[1:20:41] Grace and that love amen then the
[1:20:43] reflection of that of getting caught up
[1:20:45] like John was caught up to go through
[1:20:47] the open door to see the opening of the
[1:20:49] seals to understand the Thunders and see
[1:20:51] the sequence of all the way to the end
[1:20:53] time and I believe that's what we've
[1:20:55] been given in this day amen by the
[1:20:57] opening of the seals and the message
[1:20:58] after everything has been declared to
[1:21:00] the bride she has seen from before the
[1:21:02] beginning to after the end and what does
[1:21:06] that Vision produce it produces the
[1:21:09] Apostle of Love who writes the Epistles
[1:21:11] of love and when he gets to the point he
[1:21:13] can't preach anymore he has one message
[1:21:15] amen he'll sit in the corner of the
[1:21:17] church and when he's asked to testify
[1:21:19] he'll say the same thing every time
[1:21:20] little children love one another
[1:21:24] Beautiful cuz everything else will come
[1:21:26] to not and prophecies will cease
[1:21:29] everything else will eventually be
[1:21:30] finished but love charity Will Never
[1:21:34] Fade Away praise the Lord
[1:21:37] amen I'm so glad that I can say by his
[1:21:42] grace that I'm a recipient of his
[1:21:45] love I can see myself in the Book of
[1:21:48] John I can see myself in the Apostle of
[1:21:50] love not because of my great love for
[1:21:53] him but because of his great love for
[1:21:57] me what does it do in me my goodness
[1:22:00] when it all comes down to the end I I
[1:22:03] mean the end end
[1:22:06] end I'm not going to care that I want an
[1:22:11] argument
[1:22:12] Right In fact when it comes down to the
[1:22:15] end then then I might be pretty
[1:22:16] embarrassed I won that Argent right
[1:22:18] right because of the way I want it yeah
[1:22:21] comes all down to the the end I want to
[1:22:24] be like John I just want to love
[1:22:25] everybody God will sort it all out I
[1:22:27] don't have to sort it all out it's not
[1:22:29] up to me I just want to declare this
[1:22:31] great truth he's told me who the
[1:22:33] Antichrist is I know John could write it
[1:22:36] John could speak it John know and John
[1:22:38] wasn't afraid to say who cut the ear off
[1:22:40] and whose ear got cut off and who the
[1:22:42] 144,000 is and who's under the altar who
[1:22:44] the two witnesses are and who the bride
[1:22:46] is and who the foolish virgin is and who
[1:22:48] the false
[1:22:50] amen he just had the truth
[1:22:53] but he wasn't arrogant and hostile he
[1:22:56] just says just love everybody and just
[1:22:59] love each other God will sort it all out
[1:23:01] amen I'm only here to prophesy
[1:23:06] again not here to win arguments and I'm
[1:23:09] certainly not here to convince people
[1:23:11] amen that doesn't work I'm just here to
[1:23:14] prophesy again and whoever is a
[1:23:17] recipient of his love will connect to
[1:23:21] the word and they will reciprocate his
[1:23:23] love amen and I'm so thankful for the
[1:23:26] love of God let's all stand musicians if
[1:23:29] you'll please
[1:23:30] come I hope that God help put those
[1:23:33] pieces
[1:23:34] together CU It All To Me the more I
[1:23:37] study the scriptures and the more the
[1:23:39] message opens to me everything links
[1:23:43] together because you know what the word
[1:23:45] is it's
[1:23:46] God it's God do you know what love is
[1:23:50] it's
[1:23:51] God amen you know what Christ is he's
[1:23:55] God you know what the bride is she's
[1:23:57] part of the same thing when it all comes
[1:24:00] down to it it all comes back to one
[1:24:02] thing and it's just God it's life it's
[1:24:04] love it's the great Fountain of
[1:24:06] everything in the end it all comes back
[1:24:08] to the same thing expressed in a
[1:24:11] family man there's nothing else to
[1:24:14] strive for but that we're going back to
[1:24:17] the original
[1:24:19] amen and that's all I want that's the
[1:24:22] desire of my heart but I can see myself
[1:24:25] so clearly in the scriptures like never
[1:24:28] before I can see what time what age what
[1:24:32] gospel what anointing what love that
[1:24:35] we're aligned with praise God Amen
[1:24:38] praise be to God I tell you if you're
[1:24:40] here and maybe sometimes things are a
[1:24:43] struggle for you don't feel like you
[1:24:44] have the revelation of the word listen
[1:24:46] let me tell you it's not just a bunch of
[1:24:48] intellectualism brother B says it is an
[1:24:51] understanding you have an understanding
[1:24:52] but that doesn't mean you have to
[1:24:53] understand all the 10,000 puzzle pieces
[1:24:55] in detail but what you need is God to
[1:24:58] show you the picture amen the picture on
[1:25:01] the box amen that makes all the pieces
[1:25:03] make more sense amen and listen I'll
[1:25:06] tell you the secret this is I'll just
[1:25:08] put you in a little secret just lean on
[1:25:11] his
[1:25:13] bosom and say would you show me the
[1:25:17] picture don't fret don't fuss don't
[1:25:20] don't try to go out and get a bunch of
[1:25:23] understanding don't don't strain don't
[1:25:25] make your brain cramp
[1:25:27] yeah don't do it just lay on his bosom
[1:25:31] that's right in that special love
[1:25:33] relationship with him get really close
[1:25:36] to him and say I can just imagine John
[1:25:39] if you're laying on somebody's bosom
[1:25:42] your head is down
[1:25:44] here so when Peter beckons to him and
[1:25:46] say ask John would
[1:25:51] just you know when you look up at
[1:25:53] somebody it's kind of pitiful it's not
[1:25:54] arrogant it's not demeaning it's kind
[1:25:58] of and won't you just get up close to
[1:26:01] the Lord and just give him that
[1:26:03] look and say Lord Jesus would you show
[1:26:07] me the revelation of this would you
[1:26:10] reveal yourself to me listen it's his
[1:26:12] great desire to do it when John asked
[1:26:16] him he said immediately there wasn't we
[1:26:19] don't have any notion in the Bible that
[1:26:21] he thought about it it took him 30
[1:26:22] minutes and he just said whomsoever I
[1:26:25] dipped a sof and hand and then he dipped
[1:26:26] the sof I mean it wasn't
[1:26:28] complicated let's not make it
[1:26:30] complicated let's just lean on his bosom
[1:26:32] and say if there's anything in the
[1:26:33] message that's stumbling you there's
[1:26:35] anything that you feel like you need to
[1:26:36] know better just lean on his bosom and
[1:26:38] say who is it would you show it to
[1:26:42] me and he will he'll give you the key of
[1:26:47] Revelation because it works by love
[1:26:50] brother Rim says faith is a revelation
[1:26:54] and Faith worketh by love so Revelation
[1:26:57] worketh by love it comes by love it
[1:27:00] worketh by love it's demonstrated by
[1:27:03] love thank
[1:27:05] God man let's just bow our heads and
[1:27:07] thank the
[1:27:08] Lord dear heavenly father we thank you
[1:27:11] God for you are so good to us
[1:27:14] Lord God when we look at John I don't
[1:27:17] see John at the Last Supper reclining
[1:27:21] with his head on your bosom is one that
[1:27:22] you love God somehow I'm able to see
[1:27:25] myself
[1:27:26] there God there's no way I could do that
[1:27:30] in my own flesh with my own ability with
[1:27:32] my upbringing
[1:27:34] and God it's only by
[1:27:36] grace that you allow me to feel that I
[1:27:39] can be in that
[1:27:41] place God I I want to take advantage of
[1:27:45] the love that you've shown to me and the
[1:27:48] great grace that you've given in my life
[1:27:50] Lord and I just want to recline on your
[1:27:51] book
[1:27:53] over your heart I just want to say Lord
[1:27:57] would you reveal more to
[1:27:59] me would you open more understanding
[1:28:02] would you show me more of your great
[1:28:03] drama your great picture so that I can
[1:28:07] see because God it was your pleasure it
[1:28:09] was your joy to give special Revelation
[1:28:12] to
[1:28:13] John I believe it's your joy to whisper
[1:28:16] the love secrets to your
[1:28:18] bride and God we're leaning against you
[1:28:20] now asking God would you whisper the
[1:28:22] love secrets into our ears so that we
