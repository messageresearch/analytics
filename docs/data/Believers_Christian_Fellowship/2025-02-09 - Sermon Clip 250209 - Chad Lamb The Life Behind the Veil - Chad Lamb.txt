TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so much of life is just life carnal things that will fade away but there's a depth of reality that's inside of us and it's the most exciting thing in the world it's from out of this world when you realize that that that c genit in you that's part of the life of God that's part of the word that's part of Christ amen and when it was quick in life it was always there what is in you now is the same thing that's in the Lamb's Book of Life it's not like that name written there something different than what you are here the real you on the inside behind the veil that you dwell in is whatever was written in that book amen that's why when the lamb took the book it Thrills us yeah amen what makes us so excited even when brother brandom says and the lamb has to take the book and open the seals and we're all like yes amen what does it mean it's not that he's walking around with the book well I mean that's not the exciting part the exciting part is I don't know how I don't know how it come into me to know this but but I know when the lamb takes the book it has something to do with me I don't know it here but when I hear brother brandom say it in the breach I know it down here when when the people are shouting I'm shouting when I look at John when John sees the lamb step forward when no man was worthy to take the book and he hears that the lion of the tribe of Judah has overcome and prevailed to take the book and he looks and he sees a bloody lamb and the Bloody lamb takes the book and when the bloody lamb takes the book and everybody falls down on their face and then John says and everything in heaven and everything on Earth and everything under the Earth heard I John shouting praises and glory and Hallelujah why because John knew he's in the book brother Bram said he must have looked over and saw his name in the book how did he see his name in the book it was still sealed amen I don't know how he saw it with carnal natural eyes but something in John knew he was part of that book and if no man took the book all was lost amen what was John re re rejoicing about because by Revelation he knew he was part of that book what is so exciting about this message is by revelation we know we're part of the book part of the book is in me and the life of Christ is here living out that book it's the book of the life of the Lamb amen his life on display on the earth that's what's recorded in the book and I'm part of that book and the book is alive in me amen
