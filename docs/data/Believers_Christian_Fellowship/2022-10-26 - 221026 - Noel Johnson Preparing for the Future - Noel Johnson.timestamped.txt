[12:47] lover
[12:49] let thy prayers
[12:53] [Music]
[13:06] [Music]
[13:09] Heavenly Father we have gathered
[13:11] together
[13:13] and Lord
[13:16] to the best of our abilities we tell you
[13:19] how much we love you
[13:22] but Lord let us compare to what we know
[13:25] how much you have loved us
[13:27] because you're willing to leave the
[13:30] Throne of Glory
[13:31] take on human flesh
[13:33] and then die for our sins
[13:36] we can't match that love Lord
[13:39] we express it to the best that we can
[13:43] and we come Lord we've given up Praise
[13:45] of worship coming from our heart
[13:48] and Lord because of that we believe that
[13:50] you will accept it
[13:53] and now Lord we pause that we consider
[13:55] your feet and receive what you'd have
[13:57] for us
[13:58] so Lord take me as your vessel this
[14:00] evening and move me aside
[14:03] Lord I really want the words that are
[14:05] spoken to be the ones that you would
[14:07] have spoken
[14:08] because we're at a different we are at a
[14:10] difficult hour
[14:12] things are going on around us that where
[14:15] we have absolutely no control over
[14:18] but Lord we know that you can control us
[14:20] if we will let you if we will let you
[14:23] to take me Lord this evening move me
[14:25] aside and speak through me the words
[14:27] that you have spoken
[14:28] for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[14:31] amen
[14:33] while you're standing if you open your
[14:35] Bibles to Philippians the third chapter
[14:38] read verses 9 through 14.
[14:43] basically I put together two sermons
[14:45] tonight
[14:47] I don't know how it'll come out but
[14:49] we'll find out pretty real soon
[14:52] but the subject is preparing for the
[14:54] future and maybe it'll make some sense
[14:56] when we get into it
[14:58] but Paul here writing and he says that I
[15:00] might be found in him not having my own
[15:02] righteousness which is of the law
[15:04] but that which is through the Faith of
[15:06] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[15:08] by faith
[15:10] he said that I might know him
[15:12] in the power of his resurrection and the
[15:14] fellowship of his suffering being make
[15:15] informable unto his death
[15:18] if by any means I might attain unto the
[15:20] resurrection of the Dead
[15:22] not as though I had already tame either
[15:24] were already perfect
[15:26] but I follow after if that I might
[15:28] apprehend that for which also I'm
[15:30] apprehended of Christ Jesus
[15:32] rather than like I'm not myself to
[15:34] apprehended but this one thing I do
[15:36] forgetting those things which are behind
[15:38] and reaching forth into those things
[15:39] which are before
[15:41] I press towards the mark for the prize
[15:44] of the High Calling of God in Christ
[15:46] Jesus
[15:47] you can be seated
[15:51] when we look at the world situation as
[15:54] it is today nobody knows what's going to
[15:56] happen tomorrow
[15:57] all the economists are telling us that
[15:59] next year our economy is going to go
[16:01] Belly Up and there's no hope for the
[16:03] future
[16:05] and in the world situation that may be
[16:07] true
[16:09] but see we're not of the world
[16:11] we have a higher calling
[16:13] you know Paul when you look at his life
[16:15] here was a man he was a Jew he studied
[16:18] it hard as he possibly could he had the
[16:21] aspiration to become part of the
[16:23] Sanhedrin to sit there and become part
[16:25] of the ruling body of the Jewish of the
[16:27] Jewish religion
[16:29] and he stroved and he stole with
[16:31] everything that he had in him to attain
[16:32] this goal that he had set before himself
[16:36] but on the road to Damascus things
[16:38] changed
[16:40] on the road to Damascus all of a sudden
[16:42] God appeared unto him in a light
[16:44] and Paul recognized that that same was
[16:46] the light that appeared to Moses in the
[16:48] burning bush
[16:49] he realized that's the same light that
[16:51] dwelt between the cherubims and the
[16:53] holiest of holies
[16:56] and so he said Lord who are you
[16:58] he said I'm Jesus and you're persecuting
[17:00] me
[17:02] everything that Paul had studied up to
[17:05] that point in his life changed
[17:07] all of his theology was just blown out
[17:09] of the water so to speak
[17:12] and so all of a sudden there's a new
[17:14] Direction in his life began
[17:17] I look at at the lives that we live
[17:21] see people that graduate from high
[17:23] school some of them graduate from
[17:25] college they have the world in front of
[17:27] them
[17:27] they figure they got the World by the
[17:29] tail and they're going to make something
[17:30] of themselves
[17:32] and then something will happen that all
[17:34] of a sudden will change everything
[17:36] I have I have a nephew he's he's in
[17:40] Berkeley California he was a football
[17:42] player nice big Husky strong guy
[17:45] and uh first time out he got injured oh
[17:48] he'll get a car car accident
[17:50] messed up his his hip bone
[17:53] and he managed to overcome that he
[17:55] managed to work out make himself strong
[17:57] again and then in practice all of a
[17:58] sudden this year all of a sudden he tore
[18:00] the the
[18:02] one of the tendons in his leg and they
[18:04] had to repair that and plus uh
[18:07] another at the discs or something I
[18:09] forget exactly what they call it
[18:11] his whole life has changed he's not in
[18:13] he can't play football
[18:15] I mean he can't do with an injured leg I
[18:17] mean they have a term for that for that
[18:19] muscle or tendon or whatever it is
[18:21] but everything that he had planned for
[18:23] life all of a sudden now it's taken a
[18:25] turn for him
[18:27] there's other people that we look to and
[18:28] we listen to and I know I was in the
[18:30] hospital lab for a number of years and
[18:32] we would do the the companies would
[18:36] contract with us and we would do a
[18:37] series of of blood tests on the people
[18:39] and
[18:41] also maybe going through somebody and
[18:43] this guy's probably in his mid-30s or
[18:45] something like that we find out he's got
[18:47] leukemia
[18:48] he had no knowledge of that
[18:50] somebody shows up to work on Monday
[18:52] morning they would call him into the
[18:53] office and says we got bad news for you
[18:55] you got six months to live
[18:58] his whole his whole life has been
[19:00] changed upside down we'll see in some
[19:03] ways this was Paul
[19:05] he was here here he had his his world
[19:08] his his he had his future set ahead of
[19:10] him he had plans for the future there
[19:12] was gold he had set for himself but all
[19:14] of a sudden God says I have a different
[19:15] goal for you
[19:17] he says I have called you to be a man I
[19:20] have called you to be the the the the
[19:21] the the Apostle to the Gentiles
[19:24] I have called you for a specific purpose
[19:26] and and and because of the calling God
[19:30] had placed on him from that point on
[19:31] that's what the direction of life that
[19:33] he took
[19:34] and Paul never deviated from that
[19:37] calling
[19:38] I mean he said I count on myself to
[19:40] apprehend it but this one thing I do
[19:42] forgetting everything that's behind me
[19:44] and reaching forth into those things
[19:46] which are before I pressed towards the
[19:48] mark for the Prius of the High Calling
[19:49] God had called me for a purpose and he
[19:53] says I aim to fulfill everything that is
[19:55] within me to fulfill the purpose to
[19:57] which God has called me
[19:59] like I said we look at the world
[20:01] the world doesn't give us a whole lot of
[20:03] Hope in the next next few years
[20:06] we we like I said we have no idea what
[20:09] tomorrow will bring but you know God
[20:11] sent a prophet to this generation that
[20:13] Prophet came with a message to the bride
[20:16] and he was trying to tell the bride Who
[20:18] We Are
[20:19] he's trying to tell us you're not part
[20:21] of this world you have a higher calling
[20:23] than what this world can offer you
[20:25] and so what we need to do is find the
[20:27] purpose for which God has apprehended us
[20:29] we have to find the reason why God has
[20:31] called us we have to find the reason why
[20:33] he has saved us and then we need to
[20:35] change our Focus not into the things of
[20:37] the world in our business dealings and
[20:38] our education all the things that go
[20:40] with it but we have to change our Focus
[20:42] to to achieve that for which God has
[20:44] called us to
[20:46] brother Brown says we're called to come
[20:48] to adoption
[20:50] now that that's that's something
[20:53] where your word is the same as God
[20:55] himself speaking
[20:57] that is what is before the bride that is
[20:59] our predestination that is that is our
[21:01] calling that is what God has called us
[21:03] to become but if we don't focus on that
[21:06] as a goal then we will focus on other
[21:07] things in our life
[21:09] we'll focus on our business we'll focus
[21:11] on this and that and the other thing and
[21:13] all of a sudden the purpose for which
[21:14] God has called us all of a sudden
[21:16] that'll be pushed aside and and we will
[21:18] never strive to achieve that particular
[21:20] goal
[21:22] because to achieve that goal we have to
[21:24] die to ourself
[21:26] we have to take ourselves and lay
[21:28] ourselves aside our future our plans and
[21:30] everything about us we have to be
[21:32] willing to lay all of that aside so that
[21:34] we might apprehend that for which God
[21:36] has apprehended us for
[21:38] I know my younger brother
[21:40] about three years ago he was going to he
[21:43] was willing to work until he was three
[21:45] or four more years he wanted to build up
[21:47] some more money so when he got into
[21:48] retirement he had plenty of money set in
[21:50] the bank and he could do something
[21:52] then he had a heart attack
[21:55] he managed his wife managed to get him
[21:58] to the emergency room five minutes after
[21:59] he entered the emergency room they had
[22:01] him on the table and they put a stint in
[22:03] his heart
[22:04] that saved his life
[22:07] a couple three months later all of a
[22:09] sudden my brother he had no energy I
[22:11] mean he could get through maybe he saw
[22:12] one song service standing up or maybe
[22:14] one stands of us and they have to sit he
[22:17] couldn't even walk out to the mailbox
[22:18] and get the mail because he had no more
[22:21] energy
[22:22] but all of a sudden God spoke to his
[22:24] heart and says raise your hands and
[22:25] praise me
[22:27] so he did
[22:28] and all of a sudden he felt strength
[22:30] coming into his body and when he saw the
[22:32] doctor the following week the doctor
[22:34] says I don't know what's happened to you
[22:35] but he says your heart's perfectly
[22:36] normal
[22:37] he has three stints in his heart okay
[22:40] and he has to watch what he eats and has
[22:42] to watch what he does I mean you know
[22:43] it's not like he can sit there and run
[22:45] run the marathons now but still God had
[22:49] called him for a purpose that he had
[22:50] never planned on
[22:52] his thought of standing behind a group
[22:54] of people and preaching the gospel is
[22:56] the furthest thing from his mind
[22:58] but now in Tucson Tabernacle he preaches
[23:01] generally twice a month sometimes even
[23:03] more depending upon the situations which
[23:05] is there
[23:07] but there but but here again like I say
[23:09] that heart attack changed his life
[23:12] and all of a sudden now he's strawed off
[23:14] in a totally different direction than he
[23:16] ever thought he would go
[23:17] but see that was God's purpose God had
[23:20] him have the heart attack to change his
[23:21] his Direction in his life so God could
[23:24] use him for what God had called him to
[23:26] be
[23:27] you know Paul he asked the question in
[23:30] Romans 8. he said and if Christ be in
[23:34] you the body is dead because of sin but
[23:37] the spirit is life because of
[23:38] righteousness
[23:40] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[23:42] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[23:44] race of Christ from the dead shall also
[23:45] Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit
[23:47] that dwelleth in you Paul is trying to
[23:50] say if Christ lives in you
[23:52] then there has to be a change in your
[23:54] life
[23:55] when we accept Jesus Christ as our
[23:57] savior and we go through water baptism
[23:59] what are we declaring I have died to
[24:01] myself I have died to my future I have
[24:03] died to everything that I ever ever had
[24:05] hopes of or desires to and now I'm
[24:07] dedicating my life solely unto the
[24:09] service of God
[24:11] and then we go back into the world and
[24:12] we begin to just do the things we
[24:14] normally do
[24:16] but yeah we had to have we ever that we
[24:17] ever thought about the commitment that
[24:19] we made when we went into the into the
[24:21] baptismal Waters
[24:22] did we ever realize the commitment that
[24:24] we were making
[24:26] I know we had one lady at our at our
[24:27] church and she said oh I got baptized
[24:29] last week I said that's good I said
[24:32] realize this is the beginning of a
[24:35] journey
[24:36] this is the beginning of a change in
[24:38] your life
[24:39] because now you have made a commitment
[24:41] to Jesus Christ and now there's now now
[24:44] God is wanting to fulfill something in
[24:46] in your life
[24:48] but Paul goes on in here and he says for
[24:50] we have not received the spirit of
[24:52] adoption the spirit of bondage again to
[24:53] fear but we have received the spirit of
[24:55] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father
[24:58] we didn't receive a spirit of bondage
[25:00] Jesus Christ never gave us laws
[25:04] he never said all right now this is what
[25:06] I'm expecting of you to do thou shall
[25:08] not shall not shall not shall not shall
[25:10] not
[25:10] no he says if you love me
[25:13] you'll do what I've asked
[25:16] and so everything that we do is based
[25:18] upon our love for Jesus Christ
[25:20] we read our Bibles why because it's a
[25:23] love letter to us We Gather ourselves
[25:25] together as a congregation why because
[25:27] we love to gather together with others
[25:29] of like Precious Faith so we can take
[25:31] can lift our voices and praise and
[25:33] adoration to the one that we claim to
[25:35] love
[25:36] we claim he is our bridegroom
[25:38] and we are his bride and we are
[25:41] preparing ourselves for the wedding
[25:42] supper we are preparing ourselves for
[25:44] the union between the between us and
[25:46] between him and I'm obviously not a
[25:49] woman but I've observed what other ones
[25:51] do when they get close to the time of
[25:53] the marriage they are more concerned
[25:55] with the with the wedding they're more
[25:57] concerned with their gown they're more
[25:58] concerned with the the whether the the
[26:01] the other attendance and stuff like that
[26:02] whether they're dressed properly and
[26:04] everything's in order her whole focus is
[26:07] that moment
[26:08] when she was stand before the groom and
[26:11] commit her life to him
[26:14] but see what are we doing
[26:16] he is the bridegroom
[26:18] we we claim to be his bride
[26:20] we are at the end of all things the
[26:22] future there we have no we have we do
[26:26] not we have no idea what the future will
[26:28] bring
[26:29] but yet we have somebody who has claimed
[26:31] that he loves us we have somebody who
[26:34] died on a cross for us we have someone
[26:36] who allowed Stripes to be laid on his
[26:38] back so we could we could we could be
[26:40] healed he'll he he made it so if we can
[26:43] enter into his presence we can be at
[26:45] peace and we can be at rest realizing
[26:47] that he is the one in control of all
[26:49] things
[26:50] I mean I I'm in I'm interested in
[26:52] keeping abreast of what's going on in
[26:54] Washington
[26:55] not that what we do have makes it much
[26:57] of a difference in many regards
[27:00] but yet
[27:03] God will put in who he wants
[27:06] and he will take out who he does not
[27:08] want
[27:09] you mentioned that I think in in the
[27:11] Book of Daniel God will why do we have
[27:13] the guy we have in as president now God
[27:16] put him there
[27:18] why because this nation has to fall
[27:21] he has to be there so that we so that he
[27:24] can fulfill God's will for this country
[27:27] and he's doing an excellent job of it
[27:31] but he goes on which we have received a
[27:33] spirit of adoption
[27:35] we have something in us that tells us we
[27:37] are going to be a manifestation of God
[27:39] himself
[27:41] we have something inside of us that we
[27:43] will yield to the spirit of God in us we
[27:45] will literally become God in human flesh
[27:47] in this in in this in this plan in this
[27:50] earth
[27:51] because that's we the Bible says we are
[27:53] predestined to be conformed to the very
[27:55] image of his son we are to be like him
[27:57] in every aspect of his life
[28:00] and so and so the the gentleness the
[28:02] patience the meekness and all the other
[28:04] attributes that we claim to have Jesus
[28:06] Christ that should be beginning to be
[28:08] manifest in our lives because that's his
[28:11] spirit
[28:12] you know it says for God so loved the
[28:13] world he gave
[28:15] and you're always giving
[28:16] he never takes he's always giving you
[28:18] have need of healing he will give you
[28:20] that freely you have neither finances he
[28:22] will give you that freely you have
[28:23] needed healing he will give you that he
[28:25] already purchased it for you all you
[28:27] have to do is believe what he has said
[28:28] in his word and accept what his word
[28:30] says and if you can believe what he has
[28:32] said in his word God will perform
[28:33] whatever you hit whatever promise you
[28:36] access
[28:39] he said the spirit bear bears with it
[28:42] was our spirit that we are the children
[28:44] of God and if children wear heirs Heirs
[28:47] of God and Joint heirs which with Christ
[28:48] if so be that we suffer with him we may
[28:51] also be glorified together for I reckon
[28:53] that the sufferings of this present
[28:54] timer and are worthy to be compared with
[28:56] the glory that's going to be revealed in
[28:58] US
[28:59] so we have to realize what God has
[29:01] called us too
[29:03] we have to realize he has a purpose for
[29:05] the lives that we live
[29:07] we have to realize that the world is
[29:09] going to the world is is in in turmoils
[29:12] they have no answers to satisfy to even
[29:14] begin to answer the questions what's
[29:16] going on within the world
[29:18] but see God has called us to a higher
[29:20] calling
[29:22] if we can under he said he said he said
[29:24] the the things that we suffer here is
[29:26] not even worthy to be compared to that
[29:28] which we are going to become
[29:30] we are going to rule and reign with
[29:32] Christ for a thousand years everything
[29:35] is going to be subject to us because we
[29:37] will go back to like the Eden condition
[29:39] we'll go back to be able to controlling
[29:41] nature we'll be able to go back to to
[29:43] satisfying the needs of and taking care
[29:45] of the situations around us we will be
[29:48] at we will be God will so come and dwell
[29:51] in us and until he will change our
[29:52] bodies into a glorified State when I
[29:55] will never you know I'll have my hair
[29:56] and I won't be so fat you know you know
[29:58] everything will look nice again but also
[30:00] but I will be able I will be able I will
[30:03] be able to experience something that I
[30:05] am unable to experience in this flesh
[30:08] because I there's never be sickness
[30:10] there'll never be pain you'll never be
[30:12] tiredness
[30:13] and all of a sudden I can begin to enjoy
[30:15] and right now my flesh hinders My
[30:18] Worship to God
[30:20] because there are things that I would
[30:22] like to do and my body says I'm too
[30:24] tired
[30:25] and so I have to try and overcome that
[30:27] and sometimes the bodies with the body
[30:29] is six age but every now and I tell it
[30:31] no we're gonna we're gonna do this week
[30:32] whether you like it or not
[30:34] but here again but at that time there
[30:36] won't be a problem I'll have free access
[30:38] to the one who died for me I would have
[30:40] free actions I can talk with him I can
[30:42] commune with him you know no matter what
[30:44] the situation no matter what the
[30:46] problems are he will be there I can
[30:47] commune with him I can talk with him and
[30:49] there's no hindrance because there'll be
[30:50] no sin
[30:55] and goes on Paul in his writing he said
[30:57] he talks about their Keisha was made
[30:59] subject to Fantasy not willingly but by
[31:01] reason of him who has subjected the same
[31:03] in Hope because the creature itself
[31:05] shall also be delivered from the bondage
[31:07] of corruption unto the Glorious
[31:08] Liberties of the children of God
[31:10] for we know that the whole creation
[31:11] groaneth and prevaileth and pain until
[31:13] now and not only they but ourselves
[31:15] which have the first roots of the spirit
[31:17] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[31:19] waiting for the adoption toward the
[31:21] redemptions of our body
[31:23] when all of a sudden Jesus Christ
[31:25] returns to take his body home of which
[31:29] I'm apart
[31:30] all of a sudden my Redemption will be
[31:33] complete my body will be changed back to
[31:35] 20 years old and and and all there won't
[31:38] be any sickness no more pain and no more
[31:40] suffering nothing like that and all of a
[31:42] sudden I will be able to begin to
[31:43] experience what it really is to be a Son
[31:46] of God to be able to realize I rule over
[31:49] nature to me a lies I rule over over the
[31:52] the Earth because that God had given
[31:54] Adam Adam that right that privilege
[32:00] brother random with God who is rich in
[32:02] Mercy makes a statement
[32:04] he says I'm only saying this not to mix
[32:07] up Doctrine but to straighten it out
[32:09] that we might get away from this fear
[32:11] and this scare
[32:12] you know you don't know who you are
[32:15] you're not going to be but now you are
[32:18] the sons of God so you always were sons
[32:20] of God
[32:22] but see we pull back from that
[32:25] we refuse to accept the fact that what
[32:28] God says that we are
[32:31] we are Sons and Daughters of God
[32:35] and having being a son and daughter of
[32:37] God there are certain privileges which
[32:38] go with it
[32:40] I mean you look people get high up in
[32:41] government well there's privileges with
[32:43] going with that you can you can commit
[32:45] murder and get away with it you know you
[32:47] can embezzle people and they won't even
[32:49] prosecute you anymore okay unless you
[32:51] happen to be a republican but anyway
[32:56] but we have to begin to realize because
[32:59] you because you belong in certain
[33:01] families there are certain privileges
[33:03] which goes along to being deaf I know
[33:05] the the the what the queen died now
[33:07] there's a new king there in England and
[33:10] all of a sudden he's taking the
[33:12] different members of his family and he's
[33:14] promoting them to different levels of
[33:16] authority and power with it within
[33:18] within the dynasty
[33:20] there's privileges with going with that
[33:23] but there's privileges with being sons
[33:25] of God
[33:28] do we realize what we possess because of
[33:32] the cross
[33:33] if somebody is sick
[33:35] we have the right
[33:38] we have the we have the privilege
[33:40] because of Calvary to take that sickness
[33:42] and to cast it out
[33:45] and then if we can believe it that's
[33:47] exactly what's going to happen
[33:49] I know my wife
[33:51] a couple weeks ago she had this terrible
[33:53] terrible cough
[33:55] so she was nice enough to go into the
[33:57] front room so she could there hopefully
[33:59] I'd get some sleep
[34:00] but anyway she was coughing so bad that
[34:02] I couldn't even sleep
[34:04] so I got out of bed
[34:06] I came over to where she was I put my
[34:08] hand on her and I said Satan I'm tired
[34:10] of you disturbing my sleep I'm tired of
[34:12] you causing this cough get out of here I
[34:15] was nice to him at all
[34:17] I gave a command the coughing stopped
[34:20] she got some sleep I got some sleep and
[34:22] everything went well
[34:23] but we have the right
[34:26] but we fail to exercise that right
[34:30] and it's simple
[34:32] be virtue of who you are you have
[34:34] authority over Satan
[34:36] we are Kings and Priests we rule over
[34:40] Satan's kingdom
[34:42] because Satan is subservient to us
[34:44] because God is we have that right
[34:48] and we have we're a priest if somebody
[34:49] has the need you can go ahead and you
[34:51] can pray for that person you can
[34:53] intercede for that you don't always have
[34:54] to bother the pastor
[34:56] you have the authority exercise it
[35:00] and you'll be surprised that God will
[35:01] actually honor your prayers as much as
[35:03] he will the pastor's prayer
[35:06] I know we were in the other some people
[35:09] came up to me and the ladies were having
[35:11] problems getting getting pregnant
[35:14] now oh what I pray for them is no
[35:17] so I called my wife over
[35:19] it'll work for her
[35:21] and everyone she prayed for in India
[35:23] they all got pregnant and they all
[35:25] started having babies
[35:27] okay it wasn't the pastor that prayed it
[35:30] was my wife that prayed
[35:32] she worked in labor and delivery
[35:34] and then all of a sudden the baby the
[35:36] woman was giving birth to a child and
[35:38] all of a sudden the nurse came out and
[35:40] they were trying to get this that and
[35:41] the other and because there was a
[35:43] problem
[35:44] and my wife sensed what was going on she
[35:46] started praying
[35:48] and all of a sudden whatever the problem
[35:50] was the baby turned or whatever the
[35:52] thing had to be and then there was a
[35:55] normal birth
[35:56] and they would come over to her and look
[35:58] it says you've been praying again
[36:00] haven't you
[36:03] but why not
[36:05] why are we here
[36:07] we are here to take the god that we
[36:09] serve and glorify him in the eyes of the
[36:12] people not to make a big name for
[36:14] ourselves not to go around and put be
[36:16] you know big letters and look at who I
[36:17] am I am a Christian come to me I'll
[36:19] answer all your you know no that has
[36:21] nothing to do with it no in quietness
[36:22] and meekness what she went ahead and she
[36:24] prayed for these women they were having
[36:25] babies and all of a sudden the baby
[36:27] would sit there and the baby would turn
[36:28] or whatever the situation was and all of
[36:30] a sudden she'd have a normal delivery
[36:33] and she didn't go around look at me look
[36:35] at I prayed for him isn't everything
[36:37] great now is he just quiet making us she
[36:40] just did it
[36:41] but see that that's how God operates
[36:45] when you listen to brother Brown when
[36:46] he's casting somebody out he doesn't
[36:48] jump up and down and scream and shout
[36:50] no he knows who he was
[36:53] he knew the authority that he had by
[36:55] virtue of the office that he held and he
[36:57] may have looked at that demon and said
[36:59] you have no rights to this child leave
[37:03] and that Spirit had to obey
[37:06] because he knew who he was and they had
[37:09] to honor his requests
[37:11] Jesus knew who he was and therefore the
[37:14] things he prayed they happened
[37:16] once you begin to realize who you are
[37:18] and you realize you are a son and a
[37:21] daughter of God and by the purchase and
[37:23] you are the purchase of the blood of
[37:25] Jesus Christ and by you sitting there
[37:27] and entering into what God has said that
[37:29] you are you can pray for somebody else
[37:31] and you can intercede on their behalf
[37:33] and if there's a demon problem you have
[37:35] the power within yourself because it's
[37:37] God dwelling inside of you you have the
[37:39] right and the power to speak to that
[37:40] demon and have it leave
[37:44] one can chase a thousand you can chase
[37:46] ten thousand so get somebody else to
[37:48] help you
[37:49] but it's that simple
[37:51] we make it complicated and it's not
[37:55] brother random in in uh
[37:58] in this morning church age
[38:01] he says he is a now here we are coming
[38:04] to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God
[38:06] was manifested in the son in Jesus and
[38:09] in Jesus throughout all the fullness of
[38:10] the godhead bodily and that Eternal one
[38:13] was the father manifested in flesh and
[38:14] thereby gained the title of son
[38:16] then he goes and brings us into the same
[38:19] thing he says just as Jesus Christ was
[38:21] made was declared to be a son even so we
[38:25] because we are Eternal and his thoughts
[38:27] so at our turn became the many members
[38:29] spoken word seen manifest In the Flesh
[38:31] and those Eternal thoughts now manifest
[38:33] in flesh are the sons of God even as we
[38:35] are also called we did not become seed
[38:38] by the rebirth we were seated and
[38:39] therefore were reborn for only the elect
[38:41] can be reborn
[38:43] that's who we are
[38:46] but we have to accept this
[38:49] I mean really it comes down to you
[38:51] actually believe what it says you are
[38:54] do are we willing to accept what brother
[38:55] Branham what God spoke to us through him
[38:58] says that we are
[38:59] because until you're willing to accept
[39:01] what God says that you are you're just
[39:03] going to Fumble around and fumble around
[39:05] and nothing will change in your life
[39:08] you know brother Bradham when you look
[39:09] at his life
[39:11] he was born a prophet
[39:13] he was born a son of God
[39:15] but God had to take him he had to accept
[39:17] Christ as his savior before God could
[39:19] even begin to work through him but then
[39:21] he began God was showing him in visions
[39:24] and in dreams and he was going through
[39:25] the Bible and the Bible says this is how
[39:27] God speaks to prophets envisions and in
[39:29] dreams therefore brother Brown had to
[39:31] make the Assumption I am a prophet based
[39:34] on that scripture
[39:35] and so he was willing to step into that
[39:37] office
[39:39] then later on he had the discernment of
[39:41] that God had given to him and he went
[39:43] through the scriptures well this is the
[39:45] same thing that happened to Abraham when
[39:47] Abraham and when Sarah doubted
[39:50] and he said this is the revelation of
[39:52] the son of man
[39:54] so he had to believe that it was the son
[39:55] of man operating through him
[39:58] and is willing to accept that and step
[40:00] into that
[40:02] in 1960 when Kennedy was was was elected
[40:06] president he said oh he says my Visions
[40:08] are being fulfilled and so he's preached
[40:10] the church ages after that and and 61 in
[40:13] January the Angels spoke to him and says
[40:16] now you read Malachi 4.
[40:18] then he began to realize I am the
[40:21] Messenger to this age
[40:24] and then when he gets into the opening
[40:26] of the seals
[40:27] is I no longer call you church I call
[40:29] you bride
[40:30] he said there's been a message that's
[40:32] been given to me and I must be faithful
[40:34] to that and from that point on he never
[40:37] deviated
[40:38] but he had to be willing to step in each
[40:40] of those offices that God had called him
[40:42] to become
[40:44] we have been called to become Sons and
[40:46] Daughters of God
[40:48] we have been called to rule Satan's
[40:50] kingdom we have been called to to pray
[40:52] for the sick and raise the dead and cast
[40:54] out demons
[40:55] that's what our calling but we have to
[40:58] be willing to step into that office we
[41:00] have to be willing to step into that
[41:01] position and believe that that God will
[41:03] answer our prayers not because of who we
[41:06] are but because of who he he is because
[41:08] because of what because of Calvary
[41:11] everything that Adam lost as a result of
[41:14] the Fall now is available to us
[41:17] all of heaven we have access to
[41:19] everything that heaven is
[41:21] so that God could fulfill his word
[41:23] through us
[41:27] brother Branham Christ the ministry of
[41:29] God revealed he says it's a revelation
[41:31] it's an it says Eternal is God's word is
[41:33] eternal look but the threefold purpose
[41:35] of God's great mystery is revealed God
[41:37] manifested in Christ Christ manifested
[41:40] in the church in order to redeem the
[41:43] Lost Eve back to the original condition
[41:45] in the Garden of Eden
[41:48] when you look at Adam and Eve Eve was
[41:51] always a part of Adam
[41:53] after the sin in fact and after the fall
[41:56] that's when she got the name Eve before
[41:59] that she was Adam
[42:02] living in two bodies
[42:04] well we're going back to before the fall
[42:07] whereas no longer God will not look at
[42:09] us as a bunch of individuals no this is
[42:12] Christ in a many-membered body but it's
[42:15] always going to be Christ because that's
[42:17] who we are that's what we are a part of
[42:19] and this is where he's trying to get us
[42:21] back to but we have to be willing to
[42:24] understand that we have to reveal into
[42:26] grass have I got a full understanding no
[42:29] I have a difficulty wrapping my brain
[42:31] around the fact that I am part of deity
[42:36] because that's what it's telling me
[42:38] I am a manifestation of God himself
[42:42] okay
[42:44] I I have it up here
[42:46] but I don't have the Revelation that'll
[42:48] come
[42:49] as all these other Revelations have come
[42:51] that'll come also in God's timing all of
[42:54] a sudden he'll open it up he'll and and
[42:56] it'll go from here down into my heart
[42:58] and all of a sudden the revelation will
[42:59] be there and then I can fully step into
[43:01] what God has called me to be in in in in
[43:04] that regard
[43:10] thank you
[43:12] brother Bannerman hear ye him
[43:15] now then you have the word of God the
[43:17] authority of God
[43:19] and then as God shows you what to do
[43:21] you're led by the spirit and you do the
[43:23] things that's pleasing to God so God it
[43:26] was training okay now Jesus was being
[43:29] adopted on the day of Mount
[43:30] Transfiguration God was adopting his own
[43:33] son into his family now now he took
[43:37] Peter James and John and he took Moses
[43:39] and and Elisha and Jesus and he brought
[43:42] them up to the top of the mountain and
[43:43] there you notice he was trying to figure
[43:45] before them what was it in the Republic
[43:47] place at a high mountain can you see the
[43:49] similarity
[43:50] this was six months Jesus was taken up
[43:52] with the amount of transfigure and six
[43:54] months before he was crucified
[43:57] for the three years from the time that
[43:59] Jesus was baptized by John and Jordan
[44:02] it took for those three years of his
[44:04] ministry God Tried Him
[44:06] what will you do with the power that you
[44:08] possess because by virtue of Who You Are
[44:11] because he knew that he whatever he
[44:13] spoke that's exactly what would happen
[44:15] and that's what Satan tried him if you
[44:17] claim to be this under God you're hungry
[44:19] take these dollars make them into bread
[44:20] this was a Temptation and Jesus says oh
[44:23] no he says man shall not live by bread
[44:25] alone but by every but by just by every
[44:27] word of God he took him up to the
[44:29] Pinnacle of Temple cast yourself down
[44:31] glorify yourself in the eyes of the
[44:32] people
[44:33] he says you don't tempt God
[44:35] bypass the cross I'll give you all the
[44:37] kingdoms you'll never have to suffer
[44:39] you'll never have to go to the Cross
[44:41] they'll give it to you freely just
[44:42] worship me and Satan says no no I'll get
[44:44] it I'll get it I'll pay the price so
[44:47] that I can redeem that which is a part
[44:49] of me from the beginning
[44:51] you know in mom and Gilead brother
[44:53] Brandon makes a statement
[44:55] he said now the one thing we have to
[44:57] move up to now is supreme faith
[44:59] to what we've had something he says you
[45:01] cannot have that Faith until you know
[45:03] perfectly what you're doing when you
[45:06] understand like you walk up and say well
[45:07] I'm going home I'm going out to the
[45:09] start the car it's all an act of Faith
[45:11] tomorrow I will meet you at a certain
[45:13] place that's all an act of Faith because
[45:15] you've done it so much because it's a
[45:17] regular routine with you well that's the
[45:20] way the things of God are you you after
[45:22] you have been trust after you have
[45:23] trusted him and walked with and watched
[45:26] him do so many things till it becomes
[45:28] just a regular routine and that's the
[45:31] condition I think the church will be in
[45:32] just before the coming of the Lord so
[45:34] the Rapture will just go right on that
[45:36] way it'll just be a regular routine of
[45:38] following the scriptures in the plan of
[45:40] God
[45:41] but it's coming it's merely a matter of
[45:44] it's merely a matter of coming to a
[45:46] place where you trust him
[45:49] I did a study on Havoc about three years
[45:51] ago I guess now
[45:53] and that changed my whole concept of
[45:55] faith and what God's expecting
[45:57] the faith that it talked the faith that
[45:59] God was asking habakkuk to have he says
[46:01] I want you to put absolute trust in me
[46:04] I don't want you to worry about tomorrow
[46:06] I don't want you to worry about the
[46:07] future I want you to trust me so much
[46:10] that you'll trust me regardless of what
[46:11] happens
[46:14] you take a little infant
[46:17] entrusts its mother
[46:19] because Mommy feeds it Mama close it
[46:21] Mama bathes it because it's helpless
[46:24] it's totally dependent upon its mother
[46:28] but see that's what God is wanting us to
[46:30] become he wants us to become totally
[46:33] dependent upon him for all things and he
[46:35] told Havoc basically if you will trust
[46:37] me to that degree he says from that
[46:39] point on he said I will watch over you I
[46:42] will take care of you and no harm will
[46:43] come your way
[46:45] and so I was reading that I said well
[46:47] Lord okay if that's what you're trying
[46:49] to have habit could do
[46:51] take my hand and don't ever let go
[46:53] and I will trust you wherever you send
[46:55] me
[46:56] and from that point on I've been at rest
[46:59] there's no more a struggle what should I
[47:01] do where should I go you know with this
[47:03] because all of a sudden you get up in
[47:04] the morning you have your day planned
[47:06] and all of a sudden the phone call
[47:07] coming up well I guess we're going to do
[47:08] something else today
[47:09] and say well Lord obviously you had a
[47:11] different plan for today um what do you
[47:13] want me to do what do you want us to do
[47:16] but see I have to come to the place
[47:18] where I was willing to take my life in
[47:19] its totality and give it to God and says
[47:22] from here on out you take control you're
[47:25] the driver I'm the passenger I will go
[47:27] wherever you take me
[47:29] and since I have done that I'm at rest
[47:32] I'm no longer frustrated I'm no longer
[47:34] striving to become
[47:36] because I cannot become what God wanted
[47:38] me to become he has to do the change
[47:40] inside of me it's God that worketh in
[47:42] you to do willing to do of his own good
[47:44] pleasure you are not becoming what you
[47:47] you cannot become what he wants you to
[47:48] become you have to let him make the
[47:51] change in your life so that you can
[47:52] become what he wants you to be
[47:59] and later see in church age brother
[48:01] Banner makes a statement
[48:04] he says now but he's standing in the
[48:05] midst of the church as he stands are
[48:07] revealing who he is in this last age he
[48:10] calls himself the author of the creation
[48:12] of God
[48:13] this is another Creations has to do with
[48:16] the church it's a special designation of
[48:18] himself he is the creator of that church
[48:20] the Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[48:23] bride
[48:24] God created you Just the Way You Are
[48:29] warts and all all of your mistakes all
[48:32] your problems all your frustrations your
[48:34] attributes if you have any all of a
[48:36] sudden God gave them to you because he
[48:39] has a reason for that because he wants
[48:41] to use you in this age because he wants
[48:43] to glorify himself through you
[48:46] and that's why he molds you to be and
[48:48] make you to be what what he has
[48:51] he goes on in here and says what was
[48:53] Jesus Christ he was a God man he was the
[48:56] son of God he was of the new creation
[48:58] man and God met and joined he was the
[49:01] first of a new race and he is the head
[49:03] of that race
[49:04] this new creation is where God and man
[49:07] Unite
[49:10] before I was part of the world's
[49:13] creation
[49:14] I'm not anymore
[49:17] there's nothing out there that I have
[49:18] any desire for
[49:20] I mean I look at it going on I look at
[49:22] the things going on and makes me sick
[49:25] so I'm I'm of a different creation I'm
[49:27] I'm I I'm I'm in it from a different
[49:29] planet okay if you will
[49:31] my wife and I say yeah we we have we
[49:34] live in a bubble
[49:36] and what we do is wherever we go we
[49:39] carry our bubble with us
[49:41] but then when we go to the grocery store
[49:44] we talk nice to them they always say hi
[49:47] how are you I'm doing great how are you
[49:49] doing
[49:50] uh oh yeah are you having a good day
[49:54] well yeah I guess I am well that's good
[49:56] you know when you little car I'm
[49:58] inviting them into my bubble
[50:01] I want them to experience the peace and
[50:03] the joy and the long suffering that I
[50:05] have experienced I want them to meet the
[50:07] God that I serve I want them to meet the
[50:09] god that changed my life I want to
[50:11] introduce them to something which is
[50:13] greater than themselves we're no longer
[50:15] do they have to struggle with the rest
[50:16] of the world but now all of a sudden I
[50:18] can show them something which is totally
[50:19] beyond their comprehension
[50:22] so I invite them into my bubble
[50:25] I'm not interested in getting into
[50:26] theirs
[50:29] but you understand my wife and I are
[50:32] part of a
[50:34] old folks
[50:36] elderly choir whatever you call it and
[50:38] uh you have to be a 65 or older you know
[50:42] some of the younger ones that were
[50:43] trying to get into and well yeah okay
[50:45] we'll let she had
[50:46] there's seven different denominations
[50:49] represented
[50:51] sometimes as many as 40 people are there
[50:54] I mean there's Jehovah Witness or
[50:56] seven-day Adventists there's methodists
[50:58] they're they're uh Presbyterian there
[51:00] there's uh I I don't know all of them
[51:03] but we all have one thing in common we
[51:05] love Jesus Christ
[51:07] and we come together for the sole
[51:09] purpose of praising our God
[51:12] and they they play all the old songs
[51:13] that we like
[51:15] and so we enter into them we sing song
[51:17] and we've seen miracles
[51:19] this one lady was testifying see she was
[51:22] she had no more money and she was she
[51:24] was real low on gas and she drove for a
[51:26] whole week on less than a quarter tank
[51:28] of gas which at the end of the week was
[51:30] over and she finally got paid she still
[51:32] had less than a quarter tank she had not
[51:33] used any gas in a week and she driven a
[51:35] few couple hundred miles
[51:37] God supplied
[51:39] there have been other people who had
[51:40] kidney cancer God healed him other
[51:43] people have had other diseases or other
[51:45] prayer requests we've prayed for other
[51:47] people in there and we've seen God
[51:48] undertake for them
[51:50] they're walking in the light they have
[51:53] and so what we're doing we are trying to
[51:55] take the light that we have and we're
[51:57] trying to shine it to them
[51:59] so that if there is seed there they will
[52:01] come and if not they will
[52:04] if not God will judge them according to
[52:07] what they know
[52:09] so we don't discuss Doctrine if they ask
[52:11] fine we don't push it but they know what
[52:15] church we go to they know a lot of the
[52:16] people that go to our church
[52:18] they know we're missionaries to India
[52:21] and they love us and they respected
[52:22] we're going to be gone for a cup for
[52:24] gone for a couple weeks we're going so
[52:25] much in such a place oh we'll remember
[52:27] you in prayer and so every time they get
[52:29] together they remember us
[52:31] I mean there's a love relationship that
[52:33] all of us possess in that group
[52:36] and we we value that
[52:41] brother brother Adam goes on here there
[52:43] you can see that though man was of the
[52:45] old order or Creation in Union with
[52:47] Christ he has become a new the new
[52:50] creation of God this new creation is not
[52:53] the old creation made over or could not
[52:55] be called a New Creations exactly what
[52:57] is it is a new creation it's another
[52:59] creation distinct from the old one no
[53:02] longer is he dealing by ways of the
[53:04] flesh that was how he dealt with Israel
[53:05] he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue
[53:08] through Godly Isaac Jacob
[53:10] uh I Godly Isaac Klein but now out of
[53:14] every Kindred tribe and Nation he has
[53:15] purposed a new creation he was the first
[53:18] of that creation he was God created in
[53:21] the form of man now by his Spirit he is
[53:23] creating many sons unto himself God the
[53:26] Creator creating himself a part of his
[53:28] creation
[53:29] God is creating himself in you
[53:32] you wonder what's going on in your life
[53:35] there's something going on God has
[53:37] worked god let's see God works in you is
[53:39] willing to do of his own good pleasure
[53:40] so he's taking you from the inside into
[53:43] beginning to mold your character until
[53:45] you can come to adoption until you can
[53:48] go and and after the Rapture we can go
[53:50] back to the eating condition we can
[53:51] become what God intended for us to be
[53:53] from the beginning
[53:55] but he has to mold our character we we
[53:57] have to have the character of Jesus
[53:59] Christ
[54:00] because their dwells within us the power
[54:02] to speak and whenever we speak it'll
[54:04] happen
[54:05] but if you don't have the character of
[54:07] Christ what would you do with that power
[54:09] if I was going through Atlanta on a bad
[54:11] day there'd be a lot fewer drivers I'd
[54:13] speak him out of existence
[54:15] but see that's using it wrong
[54:18] so now I find a way around I take by
[54:20] roads and go as far away from her land
[54:22] as I can but anyway but but you have to
[54:24] understand but if I had the power of the
[54:27] spoken word
[54:29] how would I use it
[54:31] but there was a time that my wife and I
[54:33] we were in India and I'm I tend to be
[54:35] very punctual I like being on time
[54:38] we were driving to have a meeting we
[54:41] were already two hours late I was mad I
[54:43] was frustrated
[54:44] and so we get we're driving into the
[54:46] village and all of a sudden this guy
[54:48] stands in front of the car waving his
[54:50] hands emergency pray emergency pray I
[54:53] figured great and we're already late now
[54:56] what
[54:57] I I'm telling you that for a reason
[55:00] they took us down an Alleyway and on the
[55:02] Last House on the Left we walked in
[55:03] there and there's this young lady
[55:04] probably I would put late 20s maybe that
[55:09] her husband had died and both of her
[55:10] children had died
[55:12] and some minister
[55:14] told her she had an evil Wicked spirit
[55:16] and in order to get rid of that Spirit
[55:18] you have to fast for 40 days and 40
[55:20] nights
[55:22] they don't have that they don't have
[55:24] enough
[55:26] muscle mass they didn't have enough
[55:27] energy they don't have enough enough fat
[55:30] for if it's stored to be able to sustain
[55:33] them unless God's calling that
[55:35] but she was obedient
[55:38] and it got to the place where her all of
[55:40] her systems were starting to shut down
[55:42] her kidneys and and the rest of it they
[55:45] took her to the hospital the hospital
[55:46] looked at her situation says she's
[55:49] Beyond hope there's nothing Medical
[55:50] Science can do for her she's she's dying
[55:54] and I looked at the situation all of a
[55:56] sudden
[55:57] I just looked at it and the words that
[55:59] came out of my mouth it says God don't
[56:01] look at this don't look at the stupidity
[56:03] of the ACT but look at the sincerity of
[56:05] her heart and give her her life back
[56:08] and God honored that
[56:12] even when I was in a bad mood
[56:16] you don't have to be you know up in the
[56:18] heavenlies
[56:20] you don't have to be riding above
[56:21] everything and everything is going just
[56:23] wonderful in every Rosie with you and
[56:25] our you know every all the bills are
[56:26] paid and the car is full of
[56:27] refrigerators packed and no even when
[56:31] you're at the lowest
[56:32] God will use you if you will let him
[56:36] because he needs of he needs a mouth
[56:38] that he can speak through
[56:41] and sometimes they'll Choose You
[56:44] so don't look at your condition
[56:47] look at the analyze the situation says
[56:49] well Lord why am I here
[56:52] and he'll say yeah I'm you you're there
[56:54] because I want to glorify myself through
[56:56] you
[56:58] and then he will use you
[57:02] so brother Branham goes on and this this
[57:04] he says
[57:05] he said this is the true revelation of
[57:07] God this was his purpose the purpose
[57:10] took form through it through election
[57:11] that is why he could look right down
[57:13] through the last age then all it would
[57:15] be over and see himself there in the
[57:17] midst of the church as the author of
[57:18] this new creation of God his Sovereign
[57:21] power brought it to pass by his own
[57:24] decree he elected the members of this CR
[57:26] this new creation he predestinated them
[57:29] to the adoption of sons according to the
[57:31] good pleasure of his will and by his
[57:33] omniscience and omnipotence he brought
[57:35] it to pass
[57:37] it doesn't tell us talk us about us
[57:40] doing anything
[57:42] it's talking about God he has a bride
[57:45] and he's going to take that bride and
[57:47] he's going to mold him and he's going to
[57:48] make them into the into the image of of
[57:50] himself so that he can glorify himself
[57:52] in this generation because we will be
[57:55] the final voice to the final Aid we'll
[57:57] be the final manifestation of God to
[57:59] this earth before he takes us out off
[58:01] this planet
[58:02] but he has to get us into the position
[58:04] where we trust him
[58:06] we'll be willing to take our lives and
[58:08] literally put our lives into his hands
[58:10] and says Lord here I am use me
[58:13] and regardless of what happens tomorrow
[58:15] regardless of what happens in the
[58:16] election regardless of anything else
[58:17] that's going on we have a calling higher
[58:20] than what this world can even begin to
[58:21] comprehend because we are a part of God
[58:24] and God is wanting to take us and he
[58:26] wants to manifest himself through us and
[58:29] all we have to do is yield
[58:32] that's all we have to do
[58:34] so Lord here I am
[58:37] use me
[58:41] Revelation 10 7 but in the days of the
[58:43] voice of the seventh angel and he shall
[58:45] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[58:47] be finished
[58:48] we are that mystery
[58:51] we are the mystery of God so dwelling in
[58:54] sinful flesh that God can take that
[58:56] sinful flesh and he can use it and
[58:57] glorify himself through it
[59:00] he goes on he says in our voice which I
[59:02] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[59:04] says go and take the little book which
[59:05] is open in the hands of the Angel and
[59:07] standeth upon the scene upon the Earth
[59:08] and he went unto the angel and said give
[59:10] me the little book he said unto me take
[59:12] it and eat it and so make make thy belly
[59:15] bitter but in their mouth it'll be sweet
[59:16] as honey
[59:17] the angel was telling John you and the
[59:20] word have to unite
[59:22] you and the word have to be one
[59:26] how do you how do we become one with the
[59:28] word you listen to the God was telling
[59:30] us through the prophet you get into your
[59:32] Bible you read it every day you get into
[59:34] the tapes and you listen to those or the
[59:35] CDs or however you guys have it stored
[59:37] you begin to listen to them and so God
[59:40] through that can begin to tell you who
[59:42] you are and what you are and begin and
[59:44] and you can watch God in your life as
[59:46] God has supplied for you and healed you
[59:48] and done miracles in your lives
[59:51] and as you become familiar with him
[59:53] doing that for you
[59:55] then when all of a sudden somebody else
[59:57] has a need all of a sudden you can well
[59:59] Lord you you healed me
[1:00:01] and you're no respect to persons Lord
[1:00:03] Heal this one
[1:00:04] Lord Supply this need here Lord give
[1:00:07] this one what they have need of here
[1:00:10] and and God through us can speak his
[1:00:13] word through us
[1:00:15] without us realizing what that's what he
[1:00:18] is doing
[1:00:22] in Romans 8 15 it says we have not
[1:00:25] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:00:26] fear but we have received the spirit of
[1:00:28] adoption worldwide whereby we cry Abba
[1:00:31] Father we recognize God is our father
[1:00:34] my parents gave me this body I live in
[1:00:38] but this is not the real me the real me
[1:00:41] is my theophany and my etheophony is
[1:00:43] trying to tell me come up higher get a
[1:00:45] little higher you know uh what
[1:00:47] Revelations 4 1 come up higher I got
[1:00:49] things I want to show you that's what
[1:00:50] God did through the prophet he has come
[1:00:52] up higher get out of the church ages get
[1:00:54] out of the denominational system get out
[1:00:56] of thinking like a denomination get out
[1:00:58] of get out of the hindrance that this
[1:00:59] world placed upon you come up higher I
[1:01:01] have something I want to show you your
[1:01:03] sons and daughters of God
[1:01:05] you're a part of God from the beginning
[1:01:06] and now God has wanted to manifest
[1:01:08] himself through you this is who you are
[1:01:10] this is what you are
[1:01:12] the book's been open to the bride
[1:01:15] do we understand it all no
[1:01:17] don't have to understand it just believe
[1:01:19] it
[1:01:21] but if we can understand who we are God
[1:01:23] is my father
[1:01:25] and if God is my father there are
[1:01:27] certain privileges that go with that
[1:01:30] you know when I was when I was young I
[1:01:32] got in an argument with another kid uh
[1:01:34] another little kid I didn't want to
[1:01:36] fight him
[1:01:37] he didn't want to fight me
[1:01:39] but it wasn't my daddy can beat up your
[1:01:42] daddy no my daddy is bigger than your
[1:01:44] daddy my daddy can beat up your daddy
[1:01:46] and so we argued back and forth and then
[1:01:47] we went home hey Dad you're gonna have
[1:01:49] to fight this kid's father
[1:01:54] well my dad can do anything
[1:01:57] I mean you do take a five-year-old kid
[1:01:59] he looks at his father
[1:02:01] my father is invincible
[1:02:03] my father's Almighty my father has the
[1:02:06] brains of the world my dad can do
[1:02:08] anything because he's my father
[1:02:11] well my father As I Grew Older I found
[1:02:14] out actually my dad was limited a little
[1:02:16] bit here and there okay
[1:02:18] but my real father God
[1:02:21] he has no limitations
[1:02:25] Satan bothering me hey Dad
[1:02:27] can you do something with this guy I'm
[1:02:29] getting tired of him bothering me all
[1:02:31] the time
[1:02:32] he just give me a Thousand Angels should
[1:02:34] do just come on you know just give me
[1:02:36] those and we'll take care of this
[1:02:39] I'm making it funny but I'm using it to
[1:02:41] make a point we have access to
[1:02:43] everything God is we have at brother
[1:02:46] Branham said that God will God will
[1:02:48] bankrupt Heaven before he'll let one of
[1:02:49] his promises fall
[1:02:52] so why don't we access him why don't we
[1:02:55] treat him like he is our father why
[1:02:57] don't we love him the way that he
[1:02:59] desires for us to love him when somebody
[1:03:01] asks Jesus Christ is what's the greatest
[1:03:03] of The Commandments
[1:03:05] is to love God with everything that's
[1:03:07] within you
[1:03:09] and then love your neighbor the same way
[1:03:10] you love yourself
[1:03:12] and these two Commandments the rest of
[1:03:14] us all the laws and all the prophets
[1:03:17] and if we can begin to honor if we could
[1:03:19] begin to believe in that God
[1:03:22] you know God came down on Mount Sinai
[1:03:24] lightning thundering earthquakes
[1:03:28] Moses told the people God delivered you
[1:03:30] from Egypt because he loved you
[1:03:33] but they took back in fear
[1:03:35] oh wow they look at this thing
[1:03:38] what are we going to do now if I walk in
[1:03:40] there God's going to smite me I'll just
[1:03:41] be as greasy spot
[1:03:43] when really if they realize that God
[1:03:45] loved them enough to deliver them from
[1:03:47] Egypt that God is the one that's applied
[1:03:49] all their needs as they wander through
[1:03:51] the Wilderness that God promised to give
[1:03:53] you the promised land that God has
[1:03:55] promised to deliver you and take care of
[1:03:57] you and supply all of your needs that
[1:03:59] got us promised to heal you
[1:04:01] who can stand before that
[1:04:04] that's my God
[1:04:07] okay
[1:04:09] manifest yourself a little bit more
[1:04:10] let's take care of this mess out here
[1:04:13] because he's my father
[1:04:15] if all of a sudden somebody was beating
[1:04:17] if somebody was bothering me my dad
[1:04:19] would come to my rescue
[1:04:21] if somebody was messing with my wife I
[1:04:23] would die trying to take you know making
[1:04:25] sure that Sushi stayed safe
[1:04:27] well I'm his bride
[1:04:29] he loves me I don't know why but he does
[1:04:33] but here again what's he going to do
[1:04:35] he's going to protect me he's going to
[1:04:36] supply for me he's going to watch over
[1:04:38] me he's going to make sure that
[1:04:39] everything goes as good as it possibly
[1:04:41] can
[1:04:42] because he not only is my father he's
[1:04:44] also the bridegroom
[1:04:53] brother Branham goes on your adoption is
[1:04:55] not your birth
[1:04:57] your adoption is your placing
[1:04:59] when you were born again in John 1 17 I
[1:05:02] believe he says when we were born of the
[1:05:04] spirit of God we were the sons of God
[1:05:06] but we were predestinated now here's
[1:05:09] what I'm trying to get to you for his
[1:05:11] sons of this last day see we were
[1:05:14] predestinated unto adoption
[1:05:17] this is the goal that is set before us
[1:05:20] this is what we should be striving to
[1:05:22] attain to this is our future
[1:05:25] the what's going on in the world is not
[1:05:27] our future
[1:05:28] no this is our future adoption coming
[1:05:31] into the fullness of the manifestation
[1:05:33] of Christ
[1:05:37] he said brother Brown goes on in an
[1:05:39] adoption part too he says now when the
[1:05:41] father of the Old Testament understood
[1:05:43] that that his son was was was come of
[1:05:46] Age and and had to be seasoned out into
[1:05:50] adoption he said they're born a child
[1:05:53] but when but when they're a son right
[1:05:55] then
[1:05:56] but then there'll never be no more than
[1:05:58] just a child just an ordinary son until
[1:06:01] they mature
[1:06:02] and so what they are
[1:06:05] you take a child you take a
[1:06:08] three-year-old
[1:06:09] and say you work on cars
[1:06:12] okay you take a three-year-old you set
[1:06:15] them up on the on on the on the on the
[1:06:17] defender of the car you're taking this
[1:06:19] engine apart and carburetors and
[1:06:20] whatever else they have under the hood
[1:06:22] and you're sitting there and you're
[1:06:23] showing them season this is this and
[1:06:25] this is this this and this you start
[1:06:27] taking it apart your kid's watching
[1:06:29] well all of a sudden when he gets to be
[1:06:31] six or seven years old you set him up on
[1:06:33] the hood and says here's son why don't
[1:06:35] you take this off and let's see what you
[1:06:36] can do with it
[1:06:37] because he had watched often enough now
[1:06:39] he knew the part he knew what to do when
[1:06:42] you got it off
[1:06:43] and then when he gets to be 12 13 years
[1:06:46] of hell he says yeah the car needs to be
[1:06:48] worked on here this is what's wrong with
[1:06:50] it go fix it
[1:06:51] because he has learned he has been
[1:06:53] taught he has been trained but see
[1:06:56] that's what God's trying to do for us
[1:06:57] now we have watched God work through a
[1:07:00] prophet we have watched God to do
[1:07:01] Miracles we watch God heal the sick and
[1:07:03] raise the dead and cast out even we've
[1:07:05] watched him sit there and still the
[1:07:06] storm and create squirrels and bring him
[1:07:08] into existence God is trying to show the
[1:07:10] bride this is what you are this is what
[1:07:12] you possess
[1:07:13] this is what you are capable of because
[1:07:16] of the god that has called you because
[1:07:17] you are his sons and his daughters
[1:07:20] but you have to be willing to accept who
[1:07:22] you are
[1:07:35] and here you hear him well that's where
[1:07:37] the church needs to be denied
[1:07:39] it needs to be a place that God will
[1:07:41] call you off somewhere and throw his
[1:07:43] glory over you spread his power upon you
[1:07:46] and adopt you and place you into the
[1:07:48] body where when you speak something
[1:07:50] happens
[1:07:51] that's what the church is needing
[1:07:53] tonight
[1:07:55] that's but but if we our character goes
[1:07:58] down instead of going up he's going to
[1:08:00] do it he said we've got to continue to
[1:08:02] believe every work of God and seek after
[1:08:05] righteousness and do that which is right
[1:08:08] in the sight of God daily calling on him
[1:08:11] and daily about his work getting others
[1:08:13] to come to church trying to get somebody
[1:08:15] to come and to serve the Lord
[1:08:17] that's that's that right now that that
[1:08:19] that's our calling
[1:08:22] but you know people are not going to
[1:08:24] accept what you're saying if there's not
[1:08:26] a life to back it up
[1:08:28] if you look like the rest of the world
[1:08:30] and you TR you can't tell you from the
[1:08:32] rest of the world they're going to say
[1:08:34] what's the difference between you and
[1:08:36] them
[1:08:37] yeah they have purple hair and you have
[1:08:39] pink hair well okay oh come on what's
[1:08:41] the difference here you know well you
[1:08:43] got tattoos from they only have tattoos
[1:08:45] from from their elbow up to their
[1:08:47] shoulder you got them from your wrist to
[1:08:48] the
[1:08:49] what's the difference
[1:08:51] I mean there are some people they come
[1:08:53] into the message and they already have
[1:08:54] that and I'm not knocking that but what
[1:08:56] I'm saying is you
[1:08:58] you have to show that you're different
[1:09:00] and you show that you're different by
[1:09:02] the character that you express
[1:09:05] like I say we try and invite the rest of
[1:09:07] the world into our bubble
[1:09:10] we want them to experience the god that
[1:09:12] we have we want them to find the peace
[1:09:13] and the joy and the long suffering that
[1:09:15] we live in
[1:09:17] we're inviting them to come into our
[1:09:19] world because I'm not going to go into
[1:09:20] theirs I have no desire for their world
[1:09:24] and so but if they can sit there and
[1:09:25] they could notice that you saw something
[1:09:27] different about you why are you so sweet
[1:09:29] why are you so gentle why are you so
[1:09:30] caring why do you do this and why do you
[1:09:32] do that well because Christ lives in me
[1:09:35] that's his character
[1:09:37] and I'm trying to express his character
[1:09:38] do I do it all the time no but I'm
[1:09:40] getting better at it
[1:09:42] I'm learning to die out to myself more
[1:09:44] every day and allowing him to have the
[1:09:46] preeminence in my life
[1:09:50] he says now the dispensation of adoption
[1:09:52] what the world's waiting and groaning
[1:09:54] for and when the fullness of time comes
[1:09:57] when the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:09:58] time what is that fullness of time when
[1:10:01] the dead Rises when sickness ceases when
[1:10:03] all the Earth ceases to grow and the
[1:10:04] fullness of the dispensation of time
[1:10:08] tell me my brother tell me my sister
[1:10:10] when is the time that the sons of God
[1:10:11] were ever to be manifested outside of
[1:10:13] this time now
[1:10:15] when when were there ever a time in the
[1:10:17] history
[1:10:18] uh this that that this for me
[1:10:21] when is there ever time in history this
[1:10:24] that manifested at the time to deliver
[1:10:26] nature he said I had to wait until this
[1:10:29] time now all things has been brought
[1:10:31] coming shaping up to a headstone to the
[1:10:35] manifestation of the sons of God coming
[1:10:37] back and the spirit of God coming into
[1:10:39] these men so perfectly until their
[1:10:41] ministry will be so close like Christ
[1:10:43] till it'll join him and the church
[1:10:45] together
[1:10:46] then brother Branham goes on after the
[1:10:49] sea that was preached before the seals
[1:10:50] then he's going on after the seals he
[1:10:52] says I believe the mechanics is here
[1:10:54] they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll
[1:10:56] take her off the earth into glory and
[1:10:58] the Rapture he is the Dynamics we just
[1:11:00] become members of the machine of his
[1:11:02] body forming ourselves into his image
[1:11:05] and see him uniting himself with us in
[1:11:09] his works with his love gifts that he
[1:11:11] hands them to us just before the wedding
[1:11:13] supper he said the Dynamics of this
[1:11:15] church will be a refilling of the holy
[1:11:17] spirit that we have worked in in a small
[1:11:20] measure while The Headstone is coming
[1:11:22] down to unite with the body but when
[1:11:24] that head and body unites together the
[1:11:26] full power of the Holy Ghost will rise
[1:11:28] her up uh just exactly like that even
[1:11:30] the dead that's been dead in Christ for
[1:11:32] hundreds of years will ago will rise up
[1:11:34] in the beauty of Holiness and take a
[1:11:36] flight into the sky
[1:11:38] there is coming a time and I believe it
[1:11:41] soon that that's going to be fulfilled
[1:11:44] when all of a sudden The Headstone will
[1:11:46] Unite with the body and then the
[1:11:49] fullness of God of Christ all of a
[1:11:51] sudden be poured into the into the into
[1:11:52] the church into the bride and then all
[1:11:55] of a sudden that will that will enable
[1:11:56] us to have the faith to believe for the
[1:11:58] changing of our body
[1:12:00] and when all of a sudden that's and I
[1:12:02] don't believe it's going to be a long
[1:12:04] brother Brown says there'll be a short
[1:12:06] quick work
[1:12:07] this may refer to that it may not I I
[1:12:10] don't know but all I know is when he
[1:12:12] talks about their he's talking about the
[1:12:14] time of the Rapture he's talking about
[1:12:15] the time when all of a sudden our bodies
[1:12:17] will be changed and the dead in Christ
[1:12:19] will rise and then all of a sudden we in
[1:12:20] a moment and twinkling an eye our bodies
[1:12:22] will be changed and we'll leave this
[1:12:23] place
[1:12:24] so I believe it'll be in this in a very
[1:12:27] short period of time just before our
[1:12:28] bodies are obtained
[1:12:30] in Revelations 5 he says we are waiting
[1:12:33] for the fullness of adoption this will
[1:12:35] take place when at the first
[1:12:37] resurrection that's when our bodies will
[1:12:39] be changed from the vile creatures that
[1:12:40] we are and we'll have a body like unto
[1:12:42] his own glorious body
[1:12:48] in Revelations chapter 5 he says but yet
[1:12:50] we're still groaning with them because
[1:12:53] as yet we haven't received the fullness
[1:12:55] of our adoption
[1:12:57] but we have the earnest of it that we
[1:13:00] were picked up from the things of the
[1:13:01] world and now become Sons and Daughters
[1:13:03] of God he said what kind of people
[1:13:05] should we be oh my when I think of that
[1:13:07] think of it uh now we have the earnest
[1:13:10] our Spirits groaning for the full
[1:13:12] adoption but now we have the earnest of
[1:13:14] it as we receive the Holy Spirit it is
[1:13:17] the earnest of our complete adoption of
[1:13:19] complete salvation
[1:13:21] we were predestined before the
[1:13:22] foundation of the world is that right to
[1:13:25] the adoption of sons predestinated to
[1:13:27] eternal life now after you come into
[1:13:30] eternal life after you have been saved
[1:13:31] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:13:33] Spirit your sons now God is wanting to
[1:13:36] place you positionally oh so that we can
[1:13:38] just work for his kingdom for his glory
[1:13:41] ladies in church age brother Brown says
[1:13:43] when God sent Wesley and he was the
[1:13:45] voice with the word for his day the
[1:13:48] people who took his Revelation from God
[1:13:50] became the living Epistles read and
[1:13:52] known of all men for their generation
[1:13:55] they live Wesley's message
[1:14:00] when the methodists failed God raised up
[1:14:02] others and so has gone on until the
[1:14:04] years until this last day there is again
[1:14:06] another people in the land who under
[1:14:08] their Messenger will be the final voice
[1:14:10] to the final age we have to take the
[1:14:13] revelation God had given to brother
[1:14:14] Branham and we have to live that
[1:14:16] revelation
[1:14:17] and what is that revelation we are the
[1:14:20] fullness of the godhead bodily we
[1:14:22] already we are to be for we are to be
[1:14:23] manifested Sons and Daughters of God we
[1:14:25] are we are we are we our bodies are
[1:14:28] going to be changed we not everybody
[1:14:29] will die where all of a sudden we'll be
[1:14:31] changed in the moment and twinkling of
[1:14:33] an eye we're coming to the adoption
[1:14:35] we're coming to the place where we will
[1:14:36] actually become what God intended for us
[1:14:38] to be before there was the fall
[1:14:41] that's the revelation
[1:14:43] but we have to die to ourselves to
[1:14:46] attain that
[1:14:47] this is what stands in our way
[1:14:50] these temples that we live in
[1:14:52] Paul had to fight his brother Branham
[1:14:55] had to fight his Luther Wesley and the
[1:14:58] rest of them they had to fight theirs so
[1:15:00] we have to overcome this
[1:15:02] we have to yield this to God so God can
[1:15:05] live in us until it's no longer I who
[1:15:07] live and now it's God living his life
[1:15:09] through me
[1:15:11] he said yes sir he said the church is no
[1:15:14] longer the mouthpiece of God it's its
[1:15:16] own mouth feed so God is turning on here
[1:15:18] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:15:20] and the bride for the voice of God will
[1:15:22] be in her
[1:15:25] the voice of God's going to be in you
[1:15:28] some limit that to the Prophet The
[1:15:30] Prophet's gone
[1:15:32] God he fulfilled what God has sent him
[1:15:35] to fulfill now it's our turn
[1:15:38] you look at Elijah and Elisha Elijah was
[1:15:42] a prophet he had a Ministry he had a
[1:15:44] calling
[1:15:45] God took him
[1:15:47] so what happened the mantle from Elijah
[1:15:49] fell on Elisha and Elisha carried on
[1:15:52] Elijah's Ministry
[1:15:54] when Jesus Christ was here and and he
[1:15:57] and he rose from the dead then what
[1:15:59] happened his mantle fell on the church
[1:16:01] and the church all the way through that
[1:16:04] time is supposed to be supposed to carry
[1:16:06] on with the work God started in Christ
[1:16:07] now the church is supposed to carry on
[1:16:09] the same work
[1:16:10] but it died over the years you know what
[1:16:13] happened God sent us a prophet
[1:16:15] and now the mantle if I could call it
[1:16:17] that was on brother Branham now rests
[1:16:19] upon the rest of the Bride because we
[1:16:21] are to perform the same thing that God
[1:16:22] performed through him brother Branham
[1:16:25] never performed one miracle
[1:16:27] brother Branham never healed anybody
[1:16:29] brother Brown brother Branham brother
[1:16:32] Branham was a Son of God but he had
[1:16:34] learned to yield himself to the spirit
[1:16:35] of God that dwelt in him he says it's
[1:16:38] not me who does the work it's the God
[1:16:39] who lives in me doing the work he said
[1:16:41] when the when all of a sudden the angel
[1:16:43] come down on in the Ohio River he said I
[1:16:47] was just standing there when God did
[1:16:48] that
[1:16:49] when all of a sudden he talks about the
[1:16:51] discernment he said I was merely
[1:16:52] standing there as God was speaking
[1:16:54] through me when something else happened
[1:16:56] he's I was just standing there well God
[1:16:57] did this
[1:16:58] he says it's not about me it's about him
[1:17:01] it's not what I do it's what I allow him
[1:17:03] to do through me
[1:17:05] he said I have to learn how to yields
[1:17:07] over the spirit of God that dwells in me
[1:17:08] and the more I can deal to the spirit of
[1:17:10] God in Me the more God can use me
[1:17:13] and now it has to come down to us
[1:17:16] we have to make the commitment that we
[1:17:18] have to make the same commitment
[1:17:20] we have to be willing to take our lives
[1:17:22] and place our lives into the hands of
[1:17:24] God and let God so control us and God so
[1:17:26] use us until it's no longer I who live
[1:17:28] but now it's Christ Living his life
[1:17:30] through me
[1:17:32] he said yes it is what it says in the in
[1:17:35] the last chapter of Revelations uh
[1:17:37] Revelations verse 17 the spirit and the
[1:17:39] bride say come once more the world will
[1:17:41] hear direct from God as a Pentecost but
[1:17:44] of course the word bride will be refuted
[1:17:46] in that day it has to come through us
[1:17:51] he said the earnest means more is yet to
[1:17:53] come we only have the earnest of it now
[1:17:55] the earnest is just is just a down
[1:17:57] payment he said just a down payment that
[1:17:59] holds it and secures it and anchors it
[1:18:02] so that no one else can touch it's it's
[1:18:04] the earnest of our adoption amen the
[1:18:06] holy spirit is now the earnest the is
[1:18:08] now the earnest of God in our hearts
[1:18:10] sealed the adoption of sons waiting for
[1:18:13] the final Waiting for the End of the
[1:18:15] Road where Sons and Daughters of God
[1:18:20] otherwise you go in in restoration of
[1:18:23] the variety otherwise you're going to
[1:18:25] form what's known to me as a bride see
[1:18:27] all right I'll go with you uh you will
[1:18:30] be a part of me you will be my bride my
[1:18:33] life will be in your body just like
[1:18:35] husband and wife is one person you and I
[1:18:37] are going to be one at that day you'll
[1:18:39] know that I am in the Father the fathers
[1:18:41] and me I and you and you and me oh I
[1:18:43] just love that and Satan gets so angry
[1:18:45] that see the Oneness of God
[1:18:49] do you realize where he's putting us
[1:18:52] he's elevating us into the godhead so to
[1:18:56] speak
[1:18:57] he's elevating us into a place where
[1:18:59] it's no longer us living because God
[1:19:00] living his life through us
[1:19:03] God dwelts in the prophet we call
[1:19:05] Brother Bradham he was a renegade he had
[1:19:07] to accept Jesus Christ as his savior God
[1:19:10] had to try him off through the years of
[1:19:12] his ministry until God could bold him
[1:19:14] and make him to the place where God
[1:19:15] could God could trust him with a spoken
[1:19:18] word God has to mold us and make us
[1:19:20] until he can trust us with that spoken
[1:19:22] word until we come to the place where we
[1:19:25] totally yield ourselves to the spirit of
[1:19:26] God that is in us God can never trust us
[1:19:29] with that spoken word
[1:19:31] he said he goes on he says all that God
[1:19:33] was he poured into Christ and all the
[1:19:34] Christ was the important of the church
[1:19:36] there you are it makes them all one
[1:19:38] and he said he said see be one as I and
[1:19:41] the father one yeah be that kind of one
[1:19:43] then how will that be the word in us
[1:19:46] would be the anointed word that is the
[1:19:48] Oneness of God see the mess the Oneness
[1:19:51] of God is the word anointed in you see
[1:19:54] and then you become a son or a messiah
[1:19:56] of this of the age
[1:19:59] so God can take and he can if you if you
[1:20:03] if you dwell in the word you continue to
[1:20:05] feed up on the word you continue to
[1:20:07] listen to what God's telling us through
[1:20:08] the prophet that word just becomes more
[1:20:10] and more a part of us
[1:20:12] until all of a sudden we all of a
[1:20:14] situation will arise and all of a sudden
[1:20:16] we will speak and God will anoint that
[1:20:19] word that we speak and the when what he
[1:20:21] when he anoints the word that we speak
[1:20:23] because it's his word that dwells in us
[1:20:25] he will bring it to our mind we will
[1:20:27] speak it he will anoint it and that's
[1:20:29] exactly what will happen
[1:20:31] but you have to have his word dwelling
[1:20:33] in you
[1:20:35] Christianity is not a Sunday morning
[1:20:37] social function
[1:20:39] it's a full commitment to a life of
[1:20:41] Jesus Christ
[1:20:42] it's a fourth amendment where you take
[1:20:44] your life and you give it over to God
[1:20:46] and you say God here I am use me I give
[1:20:49] up my future I give up my hopes I give
[1:20:50] up my desires I give up everything I
[1:20:52] have for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:20:54] of knowing you
[1:20:56] this was Paul
[1:20:58] he said he said I had my life all
[1:21:00] planned out
[1:21:02] and all of a sudden God on the road to
[1:21:03] Damascus he appeared to me and he
[1:21:05] changed my whole life
[1:21:07] he said oh just for the Excellency of
[1:21:09] the knowledge of knowing him he says I'm
[1:21:10] willing to give it all up
[1:21:13] but too many of us we have Excellency of
[1:21:15] knowledge of this that and the other
[1:21:18] when really the whole Focus we should
[1:21:20] have should be on nothing but Jesus
[1:21:21] Christ
[1:21:23] the mystery of God reveal he says when I
[1:21:26] see God's Great purpose
[1:21:27] revealing himself and having first to
[1:21:29] reveal himself in Christ the fullness of
[1:21:32] the godhead bodily and then to bring
[1:21:34] that fullness of the godhead bodily into
[1:21:36] a people that he could have the
[1:21:38] preeminence the oversight the leading
[1:21:42] brother bounces talking of Satan he says
[1:21:45] he knows that if the people can get a
[1:21:46] true revelation of the true church
[1:21:49] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:21:52] and that she can do the Greater Works
[1:21:54] she will be an invincible Army
[1:21:58] if they can get a true revelation of the
[1:22:00] two Spirits within the framework of the
[1:22:02] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:22:03] discern and withstand the
[1:22:04] antichristparent Satan will be powerless
[1:22:07] before her
[1:22:09] God sent us a prophet we should know how
[1:22:12] Satan works
[1:22:14] we should know what it means to be
[1:22:16] deceived we should know what what is
[1:22:19] true and what is false we should know if
[1:22:21] somebody is staying on the word or
[1:22:22] whether they're out there doing their
[1:22:24] own private revelation
[1:22:26] we should be able to discern the
[1:22:28] difference between truth and error
[1:22:30] we should be able to begin to understand
[1:22:32] what God is trying to do with us we
[1:22:34] should begin Jesus Christ could do what
[1:22:36] he did because he knew who he was and
[1:22:39] now he God is waiting for us to realize
[1:22:41] who we are so that he can do the same
[1:22:42] thing through us that he did through
[1:22:44] Peter and James and John and brother
[1:22:45] Branham and all the rest of them
[1:22:47] it's not about us doing
[1:22:50] it's us allowing him to do it through us
[1:22:54] he just needs instruments he needs vows
[1:22:56] that he can speak to he needs hands that
[1:22:58] he can have later on other people he
[1:23:01] needs your feet to you so you can carry
[1:23:03] God to wherever God wants to go
[1:23:06] it's not about you it's about him
[1:23:09] it's you allowing him to have the
[1:23:11] preeminence in your life and and until
[1:23:13] God can so control you until it's no
[1:23:16] longer you controlling your life but now
[1:23:18] you're allowing God to control your life
[1:23:19] and and God can speak to you and God can
[1:23:21] guide and direct your path
[1:23:24] I mean let's know how what brother
[1:23:26] branham's life
[1:23:27] God will speak to him I want you to go
[1:23:29] to a certain certain city I want you to
[1:23:30] be at a certain certain corner I want
[1:23:31] you to be there at seven seven uh 704.
[1:23:35] and then somebody's going to come by and
[1:23:37] this way they're going to be dressed I
[1:23:38] want you to pray for them and I want you
[1:23:39] to leave
[1:23:40] so brother Branham had to get to there
[1:23:42] he had to find the corner he had to be
[1:23:44] there exactly at 704.
[1:23:46] all of a sudden the person he said was
[1:23:47] coming person came by and brother Brown
[1:23:49] said God sent me here to pray for you he
[1:23:51] prays for the person and then all of a
[1:23:53] sudden he he hightails it out of town
[1:23:56] that person never knew it was brother
[1:23:58] Branham
[1:23:59] it wasn't to glorify the prophet
[1:24:02] God had a purpose for him going there
[1:24:04] because there was a person there that
[1:24:06] had a need
[1:24:07] and God says you're the only one that
[1:24:09] can fulfill it you know there's a story
[1:24:12] that brother Branham talks about
[1:24:13] he was flying home from some place
[1:24:16] and the plane he was in all of a sudden
[1:24:19] got grounded
[1:24:21] and I don't know whether it's weather
[1:24:24] conditions or what the thing was
[1:24:26] but brother Brown was going to go out
[1:24:27] and mail a card or something like that
[1:24:30] and God told him walk
[1:24:33] well where am I no don't ask questions
[1:24:37] walk but no
[1:24:39] walk
[1:24:41] he did he walked and he walked he went
[1:24:45] to the other the color into the poor
[1:24:48] section of town
[1:24:49] and there was a there was there was a
[1:24:51] colored lady there
[1:24:52] leaning on the gate
[1:24:54] morning Parson been waiting on you
[1:24:58] well Auntie how'd you know I was a
[1:25:00] person God showed me you were coming
[1:25:03] oh I'm brother Branham have you ever
[1:25:05] heard of me
[1:25:06] nope
[1:25:07] do you have a revelation of the Seven
[1:25:08] Seals well no do you understand the
[1:25:12] mystery of the godhead well no well do
[1:25:14] you understand you know all the things
[1:25:16] going on in this generation well no
[1:25:19] but she had a relationship with God
[1:25:23] that relationship caused that plane to
[1:25:26] be grounded
[1:25:27] because she had a need and God was going
[1:25:30] to send that Prophet by her way to
[1:25:32] fulfill her need
[1:25:34] when all of a sudden he said well Auntie
[1:25:36] why don't you pray first he said that
[1:25:38] wasn't the first time she'd ever prayed
[1:25:42] she had a relationship
[1:25:45] she trusted God
[1:25:48] she believed God
[1:25:51] and she had a need and so she prayed God
[1:25:53] I'm a shooter my woman where's your
[1:25:55] Elijah
[1:25:56] do we have the same relationship
[1:26:00] do you have the same if you had a need
[1:26:02] could you ground an airplane
[1:26:04] so somebody on that airplane can come by
[1:26:06] your house and minister to your need
[1:26:09] this is the question I asked myself
[1:26:12] do I have that relationship
[1:26:15] do I have such a relationship with my
[1:26:17] father that if I ask my father he will
[1:26:19] do what I ask
[1:26:22] and slowly but surely I think I'm
[1:26:25] approaching that
[1:26:29] Philippians and the musicians want to
[1:26:31] come
[1:26:33] Paul says not as though I had already
[1:26:35] attained
[1:26:36] either already perfect
[1:26:38] but I follow after I pursue with an
[1:26:42] eagerness I pursue with a purpose
[1:26:45] that I might apprehend after which I am
[1:26:47] apprehended of Christ Jesus I want to
[1:26:50] fulfill God's calling in my life
[1:26:53] I want to become what God has ordained
[1:26:55] me to be
[1:26:57] and Paul said nothing will stop me
[1:26:59] from that goal
[1:27:01] Brethren I count on myself to apprehend
[1:27:04] it but this one thing that I do
[1:27:05] forgetting everything that's behind me
[1:27:07] and and reaching forth unto those things
[1:27:10] which are before I press towards the
[1:27:13] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[1:27:15] of God
[1:27:17] in Christ
[1:27:19] he exerted all of his Energies
[1:27:23] to attain a goal
[1:27:25] that in many respects is unattainable
[1:27:29] but that didn't stop him
[1:27:31] he focused on a goal
[1:27:34] and by focusing on that goal
[1:27:36] he says I'm going to reach what God has
[1:27:40] ordained for me
[1:27:42] to become
[1:27:43] let's just pray
[1:27:49] heavenly father I thank you for using me
[1:27:52] it's been kind of mixed up I know
[1:27:55] so Lord you take the words and you put
[1:27:57] them together and
[1:27:59] and Lord I've tried to share with them
[1:28:03] what you've been sharing with me
[1:28:06] and I'm not sure I've made it plain
[1:28:09] but Lord you have set before all of us a
[1:28:11] goal
[1:28:12] and that goal is to be Sons and
[1:28:15] Daughters of God
[1:28:17] that goal is to reach and attain to the
[1:28:20] to the resurrection of the Dead to
[1:28:22] changing of our bodies
[1:28:24] and to be able to enter into the what it
[1:28:26] was like in Eden before there was the
[1:28:28] fall
[1:28:29] that's what you have called us to become
[1:28:32] Lord
[1:28:33] but we need your help we can't do it by
[1:28:36] ourselves
[1:28:38] so take each one of the members that are
[1:28:40] here Lord and
[1:28:41] and Lord help us to focus on the our
[1:28:44] future
[1:28:46] the future that we have with you
[1:28:49] that Lord we can become what you in debt
[1:28:51] what you ordain for us to be from the
[1:28:53] beginning
[1:28:54] Grant this Lord for I ask it in Jesus
[1:28:56] Christ's name
[1:28:58] amen
