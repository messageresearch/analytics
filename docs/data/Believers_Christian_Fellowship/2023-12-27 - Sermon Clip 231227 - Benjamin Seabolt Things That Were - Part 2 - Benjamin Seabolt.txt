TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery the mystery I know who that seventh angel is but the mystery of God should be finished who is this mystery because it sounds familiar to me it sounds like somebody said that to me before and it sounds almost like my this mystery of God should be finished this final manifestation of God is going to be finished Christ in Bride form is going to be finished saints of God the bride is made up of people and those people have names and those names are not necessarily written in Black Ink and white paper but they can say the mystery and all of a sudden something as brother Brandon would say something would come tumbling down through a mystical Channel and I would recognize that I am that mystery the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound when he begins to call names the mystery of whether I'm on that book or not it's going to be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard you say well that's John that's not you the voice that I heard from where from Heaven spake unto me you said well that's John no that's me you can say it's John if you want to but that's meise spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went into the angel I went into the angel I went to the angel you say well I never went to the angel did you pick up a message book yeah did you turn on a tape did you listen to what somebody had to say about Elijah the prophet coming into the scene and I went into the angel and I said give me the little book give me the little book me me that me in the scripture is a person Saints and that person is written in the word of God forever settled in heaven Eternal real give me the book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth look at all these personal pronouns I would encourage you if there is anything that I could do tonight I would encourage you do not leave this with John and that's just not me saying that we we have a Vindicated Prophet saying that John represented the bride
