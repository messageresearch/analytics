chapter three thank you musicians man it's so good to gather every time we get together it's a privilege amen may he be the central theme of our gathering genesis chapter 3 we're going to read the same portion we're going to start with the same portion we've been reading we're back to uh the series we've been on religion versus relationship part four and the subtitle for this one is separation so we want to look at this today genesis chapter three and let's begin at verse six and when when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took her the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself let's bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we thank you father that you by your grace have brought us here again you've given us strength and health and freedom and liberty and the ability to gather together then we might worship you lord god we just come now to the part of the service where we're asking you lord to break the bread of life to feed your sheep lord would you break it with your own hand nor would you would you make your presence known among us lord and god we come to you lord because we need you lord we ask that you would come and do what no man can do that you would feed your sheep lord we're coming with expectation in our hearts we come with a desire to commune with you and lord we receive from you now in the name of jesus christ amen you can all be seated and this it's it's been uh just about a week since we've read this portion and whenever you read it it's just so amazing that the serpent begins to speak to the woman and the and the woman uh she knows the word she knows i would say she knows the commandment but she doesn't she doesn't quite have the revelation of the word and so because she just knows the commandment but she doesn't quite have the revelation of the word the serpent begins to question her amen and begins to adjust the word and without any true revelation on the word but just the commandment the devil's adjustment and flexing of the word is very very reasonable to her and that's why you know it's so dangerous amen just to be i say it this way it's so dangerous just to be a a message believer as far as just being part of a message church if i could say it that way just to be part of a message church but not have your own individual revelation from god himself it becomes very dangerous because the devil can come along and take what is true because what eve had was true but without the right revelation he begins to manipulate that truth and bring reasoning and mixed reasoning in with the truth and she's she's susceptible to that and she falls by that amen and then and then they find themselves adam and his wife find themselves fallen in a fallen condition and in this fallen condition they tried to cover their nakedness or cover their sin or their shame by reasoning once again and now they make themselves an apron of fig leaves sewed together so they might cover their sin and then covering their sin they're somehow justified in their own eyes if we could just say it that way in their own eyes you know the fact that they continue to wear the apron is evidence that they feel justified in wearing the apron if it didn't work amen in their own eyes and their own reasoning when they put the apron on they're like ah that don't work and they throw it to the side but the fact that they put it on left it on somehow in their reasoning and the carnality of their humanness amen they felt like it was okay it worked amen until amen the presence of the lord came into the garden and he made his presence known by his voice and under that voice they hid from the presence of god because now amen they were naked but they still had on the apron of fig leaves which shows that man-made religion will never work in the presence of god and when the voice of god amen comes in the garden the voice of god amen is is declaring the presence of god and adam and his wife were hiding from that presence because in that presence their fig leaves were dissolved and so this passage of scripture is is so sad but it so sets the stage for the next six thousand years of humanity you know brother said everything begins in genesis he was so absolutely correct far more so than i had ever imagined before and probably still more so than i even realized today have we seen enough that we can say that's probably every bit the truth amen we still probably don't even realize how correct those statements were amen we're just scratching the surface and god is just peeling it back layer by layer and every time he does we realize that that prophet knew exactly what he was talking about you know so many times the prophet of god he's teaching the bible he's teaching the bible with somebody who who knows the author of the bible but not somebody who's been educated and educated and knowing the bible intellectually he preaches as somebody who knows the one who wrote the bible like the man told brother venom he said you know you just don't know your bible very well and brother branham put up no protest he did not protest he said that may be true he said but i know the author really well and when he knew the author really well he knew the intent the meaning the purpose he knew what that word was for amen and when brother branham's preaching he's preaching bible principles because he knows the author amen he knows what this bible was written for he knows the purpose of the word what the word is trying to accomplish and now so many people have tried to debate with the message by taking a scripture and a definition and this and piecing this together and and oh my i tell you what they they they're trying to fight against the very revelation of why we have a bible trying to find technical flaws and technicalities in which the prophet may have may have uh used a scripture amen and quoted it in in incorrectly did he ever quote scripture correctly yeah he said he did he misplaced some of the bible characters different stories he got some of the numbers wrong but he knew the author real well and he may have got the wrong number of people or he may got the sequence of events out of order or he may have the wrong bible character performing the wrong thing amen but he was never an error to the truth of the word he was never an error amen to the mind of god on the bible to the intent that god had in giving us a word amen so now and just in the in the last so many years for me it's been 20 some years of coming to the message it meant so many things brother branham says because he doesn't always qualify all of his statements he's preaching principles he doesn't always go to the bible verse and say where i actually got that from these two verses and when you take these two verses and put them together with a phrase that i just said comes from those two truths and you try to find the bible that matches the statement and you try to find the bible verse that matches the statement and all of a sudden you can't find where did he get that and when you just keep reading and you just keep reading and you just keep reading and all of a sudden that's where he got that and that's where he got that amen i didn't realize it was laying in genesis and in revelation then in the book of john and you know what what's happened for me amen the message is taking away a traditional denominational understanding and it's still stripping it away from me i thought when i come to the message i i left the denominations behind but the truth is i did i walked away from the denomination but the effect of being taught that way all my life lingered and the and the message is still removing the lingering effects and you find that he knew what he was talking about he was he was right what he preached was the truth what he preached was the word and then he caught the spirit of it he caught the revelation of it and he preached that and you may be able to out quote bible verses head to head with brother branham but you can you can repeat the verse accurately and be wrong to the truth that that represents or you can quote the scripture inaccurately and be dead on the truth that's what we've been given this day the mind of the author and so we we thank god that all the way back in genesis we see all the way back here in chapter three we see the problem that we're going to be dealing with for the rest of humanity and the reason that god had to send the prophet in the end time was because of what entered into man through his reasoning right here in genesis chapter 3 that man decided that he was going to make himself his own covering to cover his sin and that's where religion began that's where the idea of religion has begun it began right here at the time of the fall amen and that is going to be the problem that is going to plague and try to and hold back god's elect seed all the way through the bible this is the thing that they're going to be fighting with and this is the reason that god at the end time had to bring a prophet to expose all of this so that we could go free he says there's a couple quotes that i've been quoting all along i'm going to just get caught up to speed here he says in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man he's always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion feel justified not be justified feel justified that's been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion in the message satan's eden he says god's eden was established in righteousness satan's eden is established in sin because satan is sin god is righteousness and god's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and sains satan's established is in sin and religious sin so i want you to catch that that god established his eden and righteousness and satan has established his eden in sin religious sin so this eden that we live in the satan's eating is established upon religious unbelief that sounds like an oxymoron but it's absolutely the truth it is this this world that we live in this satan's eating this culture everything around us that we're surrounded with is religious unbelief disbelieving the word of god rejecting the truth of the bible but being religious to make a covering to cover all of that sin so that they can feel justified and still be an unbeliever in the word of god and that's what satan's eating has established upon religious sin and the god of this evil age he says notice cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice he come down and offered the fruit of the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious done everything that just exactly like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word and the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god so everything comes back to revelation of the word of god that's what god wanted that's how god wanted to reveal himself to his people that's how god wanted to lead his children by revelation of the word let's go to hebrews chapter 11. read a portion here and then we'll go back to genesis hebrews chapter 11 and verse 4. by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous okay by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice abel didn't figure anything out it was revealed to him by faith abel offered him to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous so his ability to offer the right offering by faith witnessed that he was righteous it didn't make him righteous it witnessed that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts now see this is so important i just want to come back and nail this down amen abel by faith offered him more extra sacrifice not by tradition not by intellect not by reasoning not by figuring he by faith he offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain amen by which he witnessed it witnessed that he was righteous all right and so now when we see that you could get into a mode where you say oh amen if you offer the right sacrifice you're righteous and now you can get into repeating what abel did and believing that you're righteous because you can do what abel can do but you're not righteous because you do what abel does you're righteous because you believe the way abel believes because his action witnessed that he was righteous his action didn't make him righteous so repeating his action won't make you righteous do you understand this is the problem with religion amen it becomes monkey see monkey do and all of a sudden god oh they're godly i'll do what they do and i'll be what they are but you can't just copy somebody and be what they are they are what they are by the election of god there's a faith that's unlocked in them and that by faith amen they believe god and it is imputed unto them for righteousness so this gave witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him so how did enoch please god by his works no by his faith because without faith it's impossible to please him and he had this testimony that he pleased god so it means enoch had faith see when we try to please god or get in good graces with god by good conduct it doesn't mean we should have bad conduct to get in good graces with god so the if i if i make a statement it doesn't automatically mean the opposite truth right so it's not like i'm going to get no we want to do right we want to serve god we want to please him but you cannot please him by works you can only please him by faith amen in that faith that will move you into an action and the action will testify that you're righteous but you can't just adapt the action without the faith and be righteous you cannot please god just by doing all the things that the people who please god do it's got to be faith it's got to be a gift of faith that god gives you have to believe but without faith verse 6 again it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he so adjourned in the land of promises in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god he was looking for something he was looking for the city of god the habitation of god he was looking for that new jerusalem let's go all the way back to genesis now genesis chapter 6. let's read through here a little bit i just want to keep going in the direction we're going right here through the book of genesis for a little while genesis chapter 6. and we'll read verse 1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose so now we know that god becomes displeased with this he says in verse 3 and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years so so god sees that now his elect seed the sons of god are now taking unto them looking at the daughters of men and recognizing their fair and taking into their wives and god did not like this mixing at to this time god had never interrupted cain's line and what cain was doing he didn't stop him from his scientific achievement and didn't stop him from his manufacturing he didn't stop him from a city building he didn't stop any of that until amen that influence started to influence the sons of god and when that influence began to influence the son of god bringing a mixing amen god come down and he cut the thing off and he preserved noah and noah's three sons and their wives and he brings them through the ark and he brings them out on the other side of the ark in chapter nine in chapter 9 verse 1 he said and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth so he sends them out he says be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and he sends them away from the ark amen to go amen and to spread out and to replenish this earth then he goes to verse 7 and he repeats it he says and you be fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein so god's desire was that they would go from the ark that they would move out and that they would replenish that they would multiply abundantly upon the earth and replenish the earth but you see man has always got a better way than god's way and we go to verse our chapter 11 genesis chapter 11 verse 1 says and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar and they said go too let us build us a city and a tower remember we said this is the first unifying of church and state city represents uh your civil authority your civilization and the tower represents your religion and so here we have the first unification of church and state and then we find this takes place again in revelation chapter 11 but it starts in genesis because everything starts in genesis and they say go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach into heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth so now under nimrod because brother ben tells us this is under nimrod's rule under nimrod he begins to become a mighty one upon the earth he becomes the mighty king amen he establishes his kingdom and now it's not just one location with a head of the family and a tribe but now there's a king who's going forth and conquering and he's bringing subjects under his dominion and he's establishing multiple cities if you read of nimrod back in chapter 10 you see that he's establishing a kingdom through all of mesopotamia amen and this is the first time that we see this in the bible and what he's doing is they're bringing them together now and they want to be unified sounds good to be unified let's be one amen it depends on how you're one whether being one is good or bad now let's be unified amen let's build us a city and a tower amen let's bring this civil and ecclesiastical unification together amen so that we won't be scattered abroad on the face of the earth amen and let's build us this tower unto the heaven so they've got an achievement that they want to achieve there's something that they're trying to do they're banding together a religion and they're tying it together with physical force this becomes forced religion because they have an army and they have people and they have cities and a kingdom and he said lest we be scattered abroad we're going to make a name for ourselves lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and brother brahma says in the message oneness he said a false union brought judgment on the earth to eve and adam and eden and a false union brought the floods of god's judgment on the earth because the daughters of cain flirted with the sons of god and they fell for it and united together again there you are false union nothing could happen what did what did god do he destroyed the whole thing all but precious old noah and his family they got together and again after that after the death of noah and that spiritual family of noah first thing you know the children of man began to look to one another again what did they do now we're not infidels we all believe in god catch this they all believe in god and i just want to tell you that is one of the most deceptive statements that can be used today i believe in god amen cain believed in god satan believes in god lucifer believed in god everybody believes in god amen but but they believed in god nimrod believed in god but nimrod did not believe god nimrod believed in god but he did not believe god amen abraham believed god amen man he believed in god too but it wasn't just believing in god amen they both believed in god cain and abel believed in god amen abraham and nimrod believed in god judas and peter believed in god but he did not believe god abel believed god abraham believed god and there's a big difference and you have to ask yourself what part of god did they believe they believed the part that was being expressed in their day that's believing god everybody else who believed in the part that was expressed in a previous day believes in god so i believe in a previous dispensation nimrod believed the story of the fall in the garden nimrod believed a man noah and his family was saved in the flood but nimrod did not believe amen that god wanted them to scatter abroad and repopulate the earth that that was the will of god and he also did not believe that god would keep his word and not destroy the earth with the flood again amen he he believed amen that god had preserved noah he believed that there was an ark he believed that eight individuals come through that ark but he did not believe god because god said i will not destroy the earth again and i will put a token in the sky amen and to show my covenant with man and the earth i will never destroy the earth again but he goes about to unify the force of the people and gather the collective force and power of the people so that they can build their own religion and their own protective mechanism to protect themselves in the failure of god because the only way that they would need that tower to escape the flood is if god didn't keep his word and it proved that nimrod believed in god but he did not believe god i'd venture to say everyone who was gathered in that city and around that tower believed in god and believed in all the stories of adam and eve and the flood and noah they were all descendants of noah and his three sons they're all they all believe it but when god brings the word for this day go forth multiply replenish bring forth abundantly upon the earth they said let's not be scattered abroad and when god said i made a covenant with you with everything that breathes upon the earth and the covenant with the earth and the sign this token the sign of the rainbow in the sky is my token that i will not destroy the earth again nimrod did not believe that god would keep his word so nimrod was a believing unbeliever and he had religious sin religious unbelief and i would i would like to just bring to your attention that in the religious unbelief the works that they were willing to do the effort that they put into it the beauty the grandeur the sacrifice the commitment the sincerity and the dedication far outshined what abraham did just if you just take it in a cardinal just looking at how much effort labor work expense material use number of people involved sincerity and dedication amen what nimrod was doing in producing the people amen with their effort and their sincerity and their beauty and the religious order and their structure and their finance and everything was far outshining what abraham was able to do because all abraham was able to do was believe god and move forward believe god and move forward believe god and move forward but god declared abraham righteous and nimrod and all of them that built the tower were not righteous so it's not believing in god it's believing god he says after the death of noah we're back in the message oneness again that spiritual family i know first thing you know the children of a man begin to look to one another again what did they do they said now we're not infidels we all believe in god so they got a fellow by a leader some great archbishop by the name of nimram and they built a tower they wasn't infidels they believed there was a heaven they believed there was a hell they believed in judgments but the children of god were the daughters of man again and they made themselves a union falsely and built a great big cathedral and a great big organization and all the other places was to babel was to pay tribute to it and god hated that thing [Music] he hated that thing let's look at chapter 11 verse 5 now and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do so too let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech and so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off building the city therefore the name of it is called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth so the very works that they were trying to do to protect themselves from being scattered abroad god come down in a judgment and condemn that thing and he confused their languages and scattered them he scattered them abroad upon the face of the earth showing that what god wanted god wanted the people to be scattered not unified i hope you understand what i'm saying god he still doesn't want this false union he still doesn't want man to unify himself god still does not want man to unify himself he doesn't want us to make unions he doesn't want us to the the unionize ourselves to gather ourselves together by our own means and by our own understanding and by our own efforts that's not god's kind of oneness that's not the oneness he's looking for that'll bring another false union but god doesn't want that kind of oneness he doesn't want that kind of unity does god want unity yes but he wants a unity of faith not not even necessarily does he need a unity of action he needs a unity of faith and a unity of faith is true unity you don't have to be in the same location you don't have to know one another see god wanted them scattered abroad he scattered them abroad because he wanted to be a father to them amen and he wanted them to do as seth and his children when they were scattered abroad and when they would seek the name of the lord they were calling upon the name of the lord and he could begin to deal with them as individuals because god was not going to deal amen in the group he wanted to deal with the individual in this false unity amen this false unity protected i hope you catch this this false unity protected the individual from god speaking to him directly this is the devil's attempt that now you did not need an individual interaction with god anymore what did you needed you needed a priesthood and you need a high priest you need a mighty king you need an anointed man and you needed a gifted this and you needed to establish that and then the individual would no longer be calling on the name of the lord they would be part of the religious order of the day and as part of the religious order it would become a covering that they would feel justified like everything's all right and they would allow god to speak to the head the head would come and tell all the subjects and what what this whole religion was trying to do was to create a barrier from individual revelation a barrier from individual communing with god a barrier to an individual seeking god alone and that is still the objective of religion today that's why some people they'll say they believe the message they're in the message and they never touch a tape never touch a book amen because they're sitting under the anointed man who reads the messages who comes and preaches and i just get it from my pastor amen it's the same system friends but the message came to abolish that thinking to demolish it to break it down and scatter us abroad away from the denomination so that we would each go back to calling on the name of the lord and said if god sent me the word i need to eat the word amen this is my bread i got from god himself amen i'm going to eat what my father has given me man i'm not going to ask somebody else to take their portion and cook me a peace but but now god has scattered us out of the denominations not so that we could bind ourselves back together under religion and that there would be a new barrier to individual communion with god that wasn't the point of the message the point of the message was to break the tower the point of the message was to destroy amen the roman system of worship amen which started the catholic church which started every other protestant church that came out of the mother turned back and became the same thing a prostitute off the mother and he came to break that walled city to break that tower not so that we would just go out to bind ourselves back together and to build the system over again praise god the word of god exposes everything how was it that nimrod was able to get so many people unified how how was he able to get so many people unified under such effort and and such sacrifice and such labor and all of this and i'll tell you it's because the fallen nature of man desperately desperately desperately wants a covering he does not want to face god alone the fallen nature of man does not want to stand before that holy fire does not want to come to the judgment of the revealed word he wants to hide behind another religion and he'll he'll put in great amounts of money extreme amounts of effort he will actually allow a ministry or a church or an organization to punish him spiritually have you seen it just so they don't have to face god alone as an individual it all started in genesis and god scattered them abroad upon the face of the earth because that's what he wanted so he could deal with the individuals and when he scattered them there was really one individual he was looking for and that one individual was caught up in that thing and that one individual was abraham he broke that whole system so that he could get abraham separated to himself because abraham was his elect seed and the prophet of god has come down this day and broke that whole system of nimrod again because he wants to get one all by himself and that one is the seed of abraham and if you're seed of abraham you're that one that that prophet came and god himself came down through that prophet and broke that system again so he could get to you you're the one that he wants amen brother says in jehovah jair he says now god called abraham not because he was abraham god called abraham by election abraham was no was no good man no better than anybody else this is doing me a world of good he probably come out of the group of idolaters down from the tower of babel where they worship roots in the ground and they had a woman up there and she had all kinds of curious arts she practiced if you ever read the history and there's where the first organized church ever began was in babylon by nimrod organized all the cities and they paid tribute and so forth to the one place now abraham's father brought him down from babylon and they dwelt in the city of ur in the land of chaldea and abraham was just an ordinary man like you and i just an ordinary man but god oh i want you to get it god by foreknowledge called him and elected abraham he knew his heart he knew him before the foundation of the world and abraham only fit into god's program again in jehovah jireh he says notice uh abraham was no different from no one else he was just an ordinary man he come down with his father after the scattering of babylon catch this he come down with his father after the scattering of babylon come down in the valley of shinar dwelt in the city of ur in the land of chaldea just an ordinary man and an old man why god called him he was 75 years old then he says in 1964 in the message jehovah jireh he says now abraham we find out don't appear until we find him here about the 12th chapter the 11th chapter of genesis we find that his father come down from babylon and abraham was just an ordinary man just as you or i or anyone else i just want you to see that the prophet is showing us that abraham's father was tied up in this system and when that system broke up terror his father brought him down he may have been a young boy i don't know how old he was amen but brought him down into ur and they were in er the child bees and and gone amen begin to call abraham begin to deal with abraham but you see that god broke this whole system up to free his elect from that so that he could get directly to his elect and god has broke the roman system of denominations so that he can get direct to the seed of abraham in this day but oh wouldn't satan love to build another system let's go to genesis chapter 12. genesis 12 and i'll begin at verse 1. now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from my kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that i will show thee so he said the lord had said unto him speaking past tense because if you read the verse before in verse 32 of chapter 11 he says in the days of terror were 205 years and tara died in heron so tara at the breaking up of babylon tara his dad had brought him down to irv the childish and they lived there and god brother bam tells us god called abraham and er amen and tara wants to take his family to canaan so on the way to canaan they move up through mesopotamia to the north of mesopotamia and when they get to the top they stop at heron and at heron is where terror dies and when terror dies the next scripture says now the lord had said unto abraham to abram so he's speaking past tense god had already told this to abram but abram hadn't fully obeyed yet the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and indeed shall all the families of the earth be blessed so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him uh-oh that's not exactly what the lord said and lot went with him and abram was 75 years old and he departed out of heron and he was going to canaan land so so we say in the message forsaking all the prophet of god says but the first thing he had to do is separate himself he separated himself from his people all of his loved ones the old associates that he used to run around with his boy her friends that come down from babylon with him and all his brothers sisters and all of his friends that he knew his associates when god called him he said separate yourself from your kindred get away from it all now that was hard but he separated himself from all his kin folks see god broke up that system so that he could get abraham alone but abram was so accustomed to the comfort of unification you understand man still wants you know man still wants a group it's true just look inside you'll find that it's right there in you man still finds comfort from being surrounded by godly people that i know and like like if i know god's working a miracle for them and them and them then we're okay man still wants a group he's still man still wants the security that comes from a group and abram was no different he wasn't declaring he was elect of god but he brother ben said he was just an ordinary man he wasn't anything special he was just an ordinary man but he was elect for ordained chosen of god and when god broke up that system to get abram free when abram started to go amen i don't know what conversation he had with his dad or whatever but down in er he was called but his dad decided we're all going to go to canaan land and so his dad takes them and they go on up to heron and they park in heron until terror dies and when tara dies the scripture says god had said to abram so now there's another opportunity for a greater separation and you know terror passing away and dying amen may have been a loss of a great comfort to abram it may have been sad discouraging disappointing whatever abraham may not have wanted to take the journey out of mesopotamia around the fertile crescent and all the way over into into canaanland all by himself he may have had great comfort in his dad leading the way amen but god wanted abraham alone and he was going to make sure that he didn't cross from herod over in the canaan land amen he allowed tara to die and you sometimes wonder why is all this happening to me why did this church break up and why did that preacher go off the scene and why did this happen and why did this person fall away and the person that led me to the message now they don't believe it anymore [Music] what's happening god wants just you amen just you all by yourself that's what he wants he wants to scatter us abroad that doesn't mean we don't come to a church that doesn't mean we want to fellowship but god doesn't want us to link ourselves together in some religious security that comes from a group he wants our security to come from our relationship with him because he's revealed himself to us he's given us his word we have faith amen by a revelation of what he's told us we know what the word is for our day and we know that we're connected to him as an individual and if we as his elect are having a little bit of trouble with separation then god knows how to bring separation see the the messages come to reveal to break the seals off of our lives and so we can see what god has been doing not just through the church ages but through my age from the time i was a little boy in the message god's covenant with abraham and his seed he says now notice when god called abraham he called for total separation separate yourself from your kinsmen separate from your father's house separate from all your associates and completely annihilate yourself from all these things and walk with me what a privilege it is when a man is being called like that how happy a real christian is to separate himself amen separate yourself let's turn let's turn to second corinthians chapter 6 second corinthians chapter 6 and verse 14. be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion has light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for you are the temple of the living god and god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so god's word calls for total separation from unbelief god once is separated in the message redeemer redemption from 55 he says notice when i remember the time when i got saved i remember the time when the angel lord come and told me go pray for sick people and a great friend of mine in the denomination i belonged to said billy you're going to be a holy roller sure is the world my mother said why billy you've lost your mind my poor old dad that died in my arm said billy you can't bring that stuff around this house here they thought i was crazy the people i was a single man my girlfriends that i had been going with thought i was crazy but i know something happened i know that i could trust him no matter what taken place i believed him and you have to believe him sometimes he calls a total separation from friends and associates but separate yourself from the things of the world and talk with god man i'd like for you to turn to the book of exodus with me exodus 34. i just want to keep working this principle of separation see it in the word exodus 34 and verse 10. and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whether thou go as lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee but you shall destroy their altars break their images cut down their groves for they they shall worship no other god thou shalt worship no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god he hasn't changed his nature if he was a jealous god then he's a jealous god now for god whose name is jealous is a jealous god lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and one called thee and thou eat of his sacrifice and they'll take of their daughters and to thy sons and their daughters go whoring after their gods and make thy sons go whoring after their gods thou shalt make no molten image so god is telling them now i'm bringing you in an exodus and i'm bringing you out into this land and when you go into this land i do not i'm going to drive out all the inhabitants of the land that was the promise god made them i will drive out all the inhabitants of the land and he says do not come into any agreement with them make no peace agreement i'm going to drive out all the inhabitants of the land and don't make a peace agreement for these reasons because if you do they'll become a snare to you in another place and he says they'll become a snare in your eye and a prick in your flesh because god wanted a total separation god had already given these people their chance amen they already had a chance in canaan land they already had a ministry of abraham that had moved up and down and back and forth amen they had already seen an elect seed of god and they still continue to go on in their way and now the the the iniquity of the malachites was full and god was now coming down in judgment to purge them out of his land this is his land and he's purging them out of his land and he tells the israelites i will drive them out but you're going to go in and fight amen god's going to come in here in partnership with israel he's promised to drive them out but you have to fight the battles and we want to totally separate from all unbelief pull down their groves destroy their idols burn the images he says totally get rid of all unbelief but we know that they never did and the very thing that they refused to separate from because it required effort it required faith in god it required perseverance it required all of these things to trust god and keep at his word until god fulfilled his word but because they let down on god's word amen they never fully conquered and they never fully drove out all the unbelief and the thing that remained was the very thing that became a trap to them and brought them down god wanted total separation why did god want total separation because he's a jealous god let's go to numbers 33 just going to read a couple quick places a couple more scriptures but numbers 33. i want you to see this has always always been god's plan numbers 33 and verse 50. and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying speaking to the children of israel and saying unto them when you are passed over jordan into the land of canaan then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places he did he used the word all all all all and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it now let's go over to judges chapter 2. just two books over joshua joshua then judges judges chapter 2 verse 1 and the names of the lord came up from gilgal to bolcom and said i made you to go up out of egypt and i've brought you into the land which i swear unto your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you and you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this now it comes and they get a report from the lord that you haven't done what i told you to do because god when god when god broke up babylon and he laid babylon or babel ruin amen and confounded their language and scattered them abroad he did that so that he could get abraham to himself but then when god come down to redeem the nation of israel out of egypt amen he destroyed egypt and he did many signs amen and he brought a great destruction in egypt but he did that because he wanted the people to himself he's pulling a nation out of a nation amen and and he wanted to bring them out into the wilderness and out in the wilderness he wanted to cleanse them with his word he wanted to purge them amen from their captivity and he wanted to wash away amen all the captivity of egypt and he wanted to bring them out and he wanted to actually purge them and purify them in the wilderness and he wanted to bring them into bula land the marriage land he wanted to marry them and bring him to the land and drive out all the inhabitants and get rid of all the dis unbelief and he wanted to be with them and he wanted to be in union with them that was god's desire what he wanted with adam and eve amen what he wanted with abraham what he wanted with the nation of israel he always wanted the same thing he's a jealous god and he wanted his elect to himself that's god's desire that's always been god's desire he wants his elect to himself you say jealous jealous jealous good or is jealous bad we we look at jealous as being bad but in this context i look at jealous as being good because he's jealous about me like i think this jealousy is beautiful i think it's wonderful he's jealous over me he's so jealous he won't let me go wrong he's so jealous over abraham he'll bring separation amen he's so jealous over abraham that if if abraham is still comforted under the headship of his father he'll allow his father to die what is that god's jealousy over his elect amen so jealous over abraham if he still just cannot part ways with lot he'll allow a dispute to come up between the herdsmen allah and the herdsmen of abraham and under contention and under a very negative atmosphere amen they'll part ways and separate what is that that's the jealous love of god and he's so jealous over you amen when you start to have affections that turn away amen god knows how to come down and rake that thing away from you because he jealously loves you i like that kind of jealousy the genesis let's go back to genesis 13. genesis 13 and verse 5. and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south and abram was very rich in cattle and silver and gold and he went out on his journeys from the south even to bethel and to the place where he where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai and to the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together now this is so beautiful god is now using blessing to create division abraham goes down into egypt and he goes down into egypt and and he gets nervous because his wife is fair to look upon and as he gets nervous he thinks that they might try to kill him to take her if they know that these are husbands because they believed in marriage and divorce in those days and so they knew that he had to die abraham died they were going to marry his wife so they they go down and he says now tell them you're my sister so we know the story and finally it comes out amen and pharaoh questions him and say why did you do this to us and why did you say and and it says that that that pharaoh made abraham very rich in cattle and gold and silver and then men servants and maidservants so all of a sudden uh abraham goes down there and he's not even supposed to leave the land god brought him to this land but because there was a famine he left the land abraham is an error but god is trying to shake off lot now do you understand your misunderstood life abraham's doing something that he shouldn't do because god never told him that he couldn't go to the land he never told him to leave the land and he's going down and now he he tells his wife to tell a lie and they bring a deception and god brings it out and he doesn't he doesn't uh seemingly punish abraham abraham leaves egypt and he spoiled pharaoh because he's laying a foundation for what has to come later because the seed of abraham will come down the seat of abraham will come unto egypt and when they leave egypt they have to go with a great spoil so now that abraham's here because there's a revolving history to prophecy so abraham is now just foreshadowing what will happen later he comes in and his very presence becomes a curse to pharaoh in his household now pharaoh has to push abraham out what is this this is all going to come with abraham's descendants the bible's perfect friends and so now he pushes him out but when he pushes him out he he spoils pharaoh and he spoils egypt and he leaves with great wealth and so does a lot and they leave so rich and so laden down with goods when they go back into the land where they were before that now the land cannot support both of them and what is god doing god is using blessings to bring separation praise god he knows exactly how to get his elect seed to himself and now they're both doing so well that the land cannot support them amen so so now abraham has a proposition let's see where i'm where am i at now uh 13. verse 5 a lot also which went with it with abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together how did it get great because he went to egypt when he wasn't supposed to go to egypt and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdman of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the parasite dwelt in the land in that it dwelt then in the land and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy hurting men for we be brethren it's not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand then i will go to the right if thou depart to the right then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and behold all the plane of jordan that it was well watered everywhere it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrh even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zore then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other and abram dwelt in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now lift up now lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward where did he get him to amen even lot and his carnality went down to the well-watered jordan because it was fertile it was fruitful he could be have progress and he could prosper there and even he moved down there which would force abraham to go the other way and where did god get abraham he got him smack dab in the middle of the promised land and he got him in the middle of the promised land which was not the better piece of land like the plains of jordan but it was the exact predestinated spot where he needed to be when he finally come into full separation he's standing in the middle of the land he said now lift up your eyes look northward look southward look to the east and look to the west why he's standing in the middle of the promised land because god is perfect and god is jealous and god always wanted to get abraham by himself to this place so that he could give him the promise and all the wonderings and movings and shiftings and right and wrong and in and out and all of it is because god has got to get abraham his elect predestinated seed in his program to his spot amen so that he can reveal to him all this word is yours from genesis to revelation in the old testament and new testament [Applause] it's all yours amen i've separated you from denominations you've had so much strife and trouble and so many things that have happened in your life but i'm trying to break the babylonian system i'm trying amen i'm trying to break it down where they don't understand your language anymore you don't understand your language anymore you're not even speaking the same thing anymore and even the ones that would come out with you originally god would allow them to fade off the scene or it would bring a contention where they would have to go one way and you would have to go the other way amen because god is bringing separation because separation is bringing relationship why the separation listen it's not separation because this one's bad and this one's good and it has nothing to do with it the separation is all about god being a jealous god and he wants a relationship with just you and he's so jealous he doesn't want you comforted by this one or that one or or this church or that system or this if any of those comforts are coming between his jealous love for you and if it's dividing your focus if it's if it's causing you of affection somewhere else or comfort or our confidence and something else god will see to it that that thing gets broke somehow and separated off because he's a jealous god with a jealous love and he wants you and just you and somehow through it all he'll bring you right back to the middle of the promised land and when you get all by yourself i'm wondering how did i get to this place in my life you say now lift up thine eyes and look from genesis to revelation from before the foundation of the world to the new heavens and new earth it's all yours i've given it all to you oh praise god praise god praise god read that again in verse 14 the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him that was the last separation lift up now nine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it until thy seed aft seed forever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land and the length of it and in the breath of it for i will give it unto thee then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of memory which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord it says god's jealous love brother brahm says in jehovah jerusalem total separation from all unbelief and remember abraham the patriarch was never absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what god said do and we'll never never be blessed any and have the blessings until we obey what god said i want to just take a if i could just take about five minutes and i want to compare and contrast nimrod and abraham nimrod under nimrod's ministry and with imran's idea nimrod gathered the people but under abraham's dispensation abraham kept separating from the people nimrod formed a system for worship abraham had no system for worship he built an altar he worshiped god and he left he didn't start a church sometimes he'd come back to that old offer again then he would be off to someplace else and build another altar he was just moving with god worshiping as he moved nimrod had a system abraham had no system nimrod tried to produce a mechanism to protect himself what was he protecting himself from he was trying to protect himself from the judgments of god but in doing so he proved his disbelief in god's word and his protective mechanism was trying to produce the promise because the promise was i will not destroy you with the flood again so his efforts is trying to produce a mechanism that will protect him produced the word of god only he wanted to do it because he didn't trust god to do it abraham failed by trying to protect himself abraham tried to protect himself and it failed he tried to say amen they'll kill me you you're telling me he tried to protect himself and he tried to produce the promise and it failed god would never let it work out he tried to protect himself he failed he tried to produce the promise it failed god was the one who protected abraham and then god was the one who produced the promise without any help from abraham nimrod put a great deal of effort and money in finances and all of his intellect and wisdom into trying to produce the word abraham could not do anything to produce the word abraham did not put in effort he did not put in money he did not have to use stamina energy all he had to do was believe god and when he believed god and he how did he believe god this is so key how did he believe god he recognized him when he came in his day in another form he recognized that was elohim there that was eating flesh drinking milk he had his feet washed that was elohim he recognized god in his present-day expression proving that he believed god and all he had to do was believe god and when he believed god god now performed the promise without any help from abraham abraham couldn't change his body couldn't change sarah's body god did that on his own in due season in fit time god did it with no help from abraham praise god nimrod believed in god but did not believe god abraham believed in god and believed god and because of that he was justified because nimrod believed in god but didn't believe god he was condemned because abraham believed god he was justified nimrod was the enemy of god and abraham was called the friend of god these are two drastically different characters in the bible and god is showing man versus his alexei the false and the true vine on display again let's turn to the book of james i just want to read a couple more verses here out of the bible as we wrap up james 2 james chapter 2 and verse 23. james chapter 2 verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed in him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god see god was separating for relationship god was jealous over his love of his elect and it was god not anyone else it was god who called abraham his friend let's pick that up in isaiah so you can read it in your bible isaiah 41 this is not the only place that says says it but it's here in isaiah isaiah 41 and god is speaking to isaiah and let's just read one verse isaiah 41 and verse 8 but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the seed of abraham my friend boy all that abraham went through and his wanderings and his separations and all that i think it's worth it to be called his friend i think that shows what god wanted god wanted abraham as his friend he wanted a relationship with abraham so god required separation for the purpose of relationship and god in this day is calling for separation for the purpose of relationship let's go back to james go back to where we were in james james chapter four all right james chapter 4 and verse 4. ye adulterers and adulteresses know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god do you want to be god's friend or do you want to be an enmity with god friendship with the world is enmity with god for whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god this is why god's word calls for total separation from unbelief because if you'll be a friend of the world you'll be an enemy to god but god doesn't want you to be his enemy god wants you to separate from the world and the things of the world because he wants a relationship amen amen go over to first john just a couple books over first john chapter 2. and verse 15. john chapter 2 verse 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away and all the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever now let's go back to john the gospel of john chapter 15. john 15 and verse 12. the gospel of john chapter 15 verse 12 this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love has no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends and ye are my friends now jesus christ has called his disciples and he separated them out and he's drawn them to himself and now he calls them friends you are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you the friendship brought the revelations he said i don't call you a servant because i'm telling you everything the father gave me now i'm sharing with you that makes you my friend the revelation of the word brings a greater intimacy the revelation from the father that christ brings to his bride brings a greater intimacy he goes i can't call you servants anymore because all things that my father showed me i have showed you so now i have to call you friends this is why god wants to separate us is because he wants to reveal himself to us because he wants to have a relationship with us but the the devil is trying to recreate systems all around us so that we gain comfort in the group comfort and the strong man comfort in the the spiritual intercessor that's not christ but another system or another man or another form of religion because he's trying to break this unity with god and man and god is jealous over this relationship he goes on to say verse 16 you have not chosen me but i have chosen you you cannot choose to become god's friend god has already chosen to be yours abraham couldn't choose to have this jealous love of god watch over him and follow him and separate him out so that he can bring a revelation of the promised inheritance it was god who chose abraham these disciples didn't choose jesus christ jesus christ chose these disciples and he ordained them and he told them all that the father showed him so now he's changing the relationship from servant because there's a greater intimacy that comes with separation and now your friend so you can go from servant to friend but in this day he wants to go from friend to bride it's going to require election and choosing calling separating and revealing to make a friend what's it going to take to make a bride a total separation from all unbelief brother benham says in the message shalom he says god is a jealous god he is jealous and he wants his wife pure he wants her virgin chaste nothing in the world into her at all all together his word part of him we must be part of the word not part of the creed part of the word not part of the church part of the a part of the bride church is condemned we know that she goes to outer darkness but the bride goes up and the message god's word calls for total separation from unbelief in 1964 he said paul was a nazarite unto the lord he was separated from his orthodox church to the world word of the living god aaron was a nazarite unto the lord he was separated from among the brethren to bear the birthstones and to be the high priest it is a total separation we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave only unto god jesus is coming for a bride a woman a church that's separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world she is separated from the fashions of this modern age that we live in she is separated from the cares of the traditions of the churches she is separated only to god and god is the word and as husband and wife as one so does the bride and the word become one for the word is living through the bride that's how that's her credentials that's her identification in the message scriptural signs of the times from 64 he says but remember the bride will be called out separated indifferent filled holy ghost born washed in the blood of the lamb she'll abstain from everything that's filthy around her husband she's a chaste virgin pure by the word the word and her are the same as a man and his wife become one in union so does the real genuine church of god see god is a jealous god and he wants a pure virgin unadulterated clean wife and so what has he got to do to have that kind of a wife he's got to bring a separation and he's got to separate her from all the traditions and creeds and doctrines of denominational systems he's got to break babylon again and he's got to separate her out and he's got to keep separating her she may try to come out of the denominations but bring a few of those ideas along and he cuts it away keep a few of those relationships away along and he cuts them away and he cuts away and he cuts away and he cuts away until he gets just her and her alone until then he pours his water over her and he begins to wash her with the water of the word to make her so he can present to himself a spotless bride without blemish or any such thing abraham couldn't produce anything the bride can't produce anything but he is separating her to himself he is washing her with the word he says if you won't stay under the water of this word how are you going to be washed from the spotted spots of these prostitutes it's not anything that we can do to ourselves the only thing we can do is submit and surrender as he cuts away let it go as he separates let it go as he washes with the word and the word begins to wash away ideas let them go as the word begins to wash away habits let them go as the word begins to wash away even old things that used to hang on in your and your mind old habits old ways of thinking let them go and surrender to the one that's purifying you by his word why what is this this is his jealous love so that he can present to himself a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing and now he's drawing her up close to his side because he's cutting things off of her he's washing her with the word to present himself a virgin bride and he draws her up close to him and he whispers love secrets in her ear he spoke in parables to the multitudes but behind closed doors with his disciples he made them friends by revealing to them what the parables meant and now he's brought the bride separated from the nomination separated from ideas of man and brought her to himself into the land and now he's whispering the secrets behind the secrets why because he's making her his lovely bride by separation and revelation the relationship is getting more intimate and more intimate and more intimate not servants from servants to friends now not friends from friends to bride this is what god wants and this is what we want let's finish with two verses out of revelation revelation 18. and verse 4 revelation 18 4 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of your sins and you receive not of her plagues go to revelation 19 verse 5. and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine line and clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints god has sent a word to wash his bride he has sent a word to clothe his bride so that she will be clothed in his very own righteousness the bride has made herself ready how what did she do she just wore the garments she just took what what god gave through a prophet and she just put it on and she didn't add to it and she didn't take from it she let the word wash her and she let the word clothe her and she has made herself ready because that's what this jealous god has wanted amen let's stand musicians if you'd come for the blake if you'd come the bride is separated from everything that is not the word that's the work that he's doing today he wants to separate the bride what does he want to separate me from everything that's not the word he wants to separate you from because this has to be a word bribe she is washed by the word purified by the word clothed in the word she is becoming the manifestation of the word the word is flowing through her she is be she is becoming one with the word she is becoming the word amen praise god the separation is bringing a deeper intimacy and bringing a relationship and satan would love to convince god's children to go back into a system say brother chad i would never go back to the pentecostal church baptist church catholic church you don't have to go anywhere else to be in a system if you bring the systematic thinking into your heart and your mind and you begin to worship in the seat you're sitting in now like you worshiped in that system amen you are under the system you are still under the roman system and don't think that the devil is trying to fight baptism trying to fight methodists and he is trying to disrupt the bride he is trying to keep you from the washing of the water of the world he's trying to keep you from being the virgin spotless bride that you're called to be in this hour and he's trying to keep you from wearing that garment because when the bride has made herself ready there's a cry and a shout and thunderings that goes off in heaven and said hallelujah praise to our god for the marriage of the bride has come and the bride has made herself ready all of heaven is waiting for this friends and there's a battle going on all around the bride satan is trying to stop that from happening and god has slowly moving and molding and washing and purging and getting the bride into this condition and she's surrendering and yielding and feeding on the word and putting it on her and the devil is trying to bring another barrier to block the intimacy with god if he can get you to think group he's got you if he can get you to rely on a preacher he's got you if he can get you to trust in your church he's got you but when god and his jealous love comes to you and just you and you know he's talking to you and just you and you know he loves you and you know you love him and you know you've met a living god and you're in contact with god amen then everything else becomes secondary that becomes the only thing and that's what god wants that's why he brings separation not so that we can be another sect of another holiness movement that's not the purpose for separation the separation is not to become i mean now we're the correct pilgrim holiness because they fell another amish another mennonite another wesleyan that's not separation it wasn't separation for that reason not to start a new movement or a new code of conduct or new rules he separated you to himself so that he can have an intimate relationship with you so he can whisper the love secrets in your ears so that you'll realize you're the bride and the devil is trying everything to stop that level of intimacy but praise god you can't win amen tried to trip up abraham got him in babylon god broke the whole system up to get him out got him to take his dad along his dad died got him to take lot along well we'll just prosper him so much that they can't even live together anymore what is this the jealous love of god separating separating separating separating until now he's standing in the middle of the land all by himself just him and god and god says now look to the north to the south when god gets you right smack dab in the middle of his promise for this day just you and him and he says it's all yours you're a joint heir with me all that i've inherited you've inherited too look from before the foundation in the mind of god look to the new heavens and new earth look to genesis look to revelation it's all yours you're a joint heir praise be to god this is why we love separation because it brings us into relationship let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you we thank you god for your word for it means so much to us lord god we recognize your jealous love for us your correction lord comes to us to correct our wrong thinking and our wrong actions not punishments not retribution lord but it's your great desire to have us to yourself you've disrupted our families you've disrupted our friendships you've disrupted churches you've broke systems and you've broke groups and you you've broke long-term friendships you've caused family strife and work problems and you've done all of it because you love us you've not done it in punishment you've done it in retribution you've done it your great jealous love has moved you into these actions to bring us where we finally get to the place where it's just you and us and you can show us the promise oh god i pray that you'd bring that reality to your children tonight all that we would come to a greater understanding a greater reality a greater intimacy as you reveal the word to us more and more wash us in that word help us to be clothed in that word that by your grace lord by your holy ghost this bride will make herself ready and all of heaven will rejoice and bring glad tidings oh god how we love you and how we thank you for what you're doing we have no strength or ability to produce the promise but you promised you would do it if we just trust you if we can just believe you believe your word surrender to it trust it and let it accomplish all that you sent forth to accomplish god be with us lord if there's anything in our lives that needs stripped away reveal it to us now if there's anything lord that you want us to separate from lord please lord bring it to our attention and we will surrender it to you lord strip it all away so well this bride is just a word bride just a word only oh thank you for whispering love secrets in our ears because you don't whisper the love secrets to those who aren't your sweetheart but you reserve that just for your sweetheart god you're identifying us by sharing your love secrets with us well we love you we thank you for what you're doing we thank you that you loved us first so that now we can love you we pray god that you would just be in us that you would abide in us that you would have preeminence among us that you would accomplish all that you desire to accomplish in this day through us as we surrender to you we ask that you go with us as we leave here bless us in our work tomorrow and all the activities we do in our travels god
