[5:44] bibles and turn to first john
[5:48] first john chapter 2 while we're
[5:49] standing say god bless you this morning
[5:52] it's a wonderful privilege to be here
[5:53] with you i always look forward to this
[5:55] time
[5:56] when we can fellowship around the word
[5:58] amen
[5:59] also wanted to make an announcement that
[6:02] next sunday will be easter sunday
[6:04] april 4th and i've been asked by several
[6:07] people who have communion service and
[6:09] yes we intend to have
[6:10] our normal second communion service and
[6:13] we understand that a lot of people have
[6:14] plans they've had long standing plans
[6:16] they've already made arrangements or
[6:17] even will be traveling
[6:19] and we understand that it's okay but
[6:20] we'll be serving communion for those
[6:22] who are still available in here and
[6:24] would like to take communion so we'll be
[6:25] doing that
[6:27] as normal and let's look at first john
[6:30] chapter 2
[6:33] first john chapter 2
[6:36] and verse 15
[6:40] first john chapter 2 verse 15.
[6:44] love not the world neither the things
[6:46] that are in the world
[6:48] if any man love the world the love of
[6:50] the father is not in him
[6:51] for all that is in the world the lust of
[6:53] the flesh the lust of the eyes
[6:55] and the pride of life is not of the
[6:58] father but is of the world
[7:00] and the world passes away in the lust
[7:02] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[7:04] god
[7:04] abideth forever let's bow our heads and
[7:07] pray
[7:08] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[7:10] jesus for your word which is so precious
[7:13] to us lord
[7:14] i pray god as we take these bibles we
[7:17] open them and read lord we can do that
[7:19] mechanically
[7:20] but we need the dynamic power of your
[7:22] spirit to give revelation on your word
[7:25] we pray that you would come now as you
[7:26] promised lord and that you would break
[7:28] the bread of life to us and you would
[7:30] feed us your sheep
[7:31] as we come lord to receive from you have
[7:34] preeminence lord speak your words to
[7:36] these lips
[7:36] we pray in jesus christ's name amen
[7:40] you can all be seated we see this is a
[7:44] familiar scripture we know this but i
[7:46] want to take from this and i want to
[7:47] talk about this morning
[7:49] uh discernment just one word discernment
[7:52] and
[7:52] we know that discernment comes by the
[7:54] word but i want to just
[7:56] labor on that and spend some time
[7:57] talking about this and
[7:59] you know john here tells us that for all
[8:03] that is in the world is the lust
[8:05] of the flesh the lust of the eyes and
[8:07] the pride of life
[8:08] and it's not of the father amen but the
[8:11] world passes away
[8:12] and the lust thereof so all of that will
[8:14] pass away
[8:16] but he that doeth the will of god
[8:18] abideth forever
[8:20] let's turn to james i want to turn to
[8:22] james if we can now
[8:25] james chapter 1 and read one more
[8:28] scripture
[8:31] james chapter 1 and verse 14.
[8:42] james chapter 1 verse 14 but every man
[8:44] is tempted
[8:46] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[8:48] and enticed
[8:50] when then when lust hath conceived it
[8:53] bringeth forth sin
[8:54] and sin when it is finished bringeth
[8:56] forth death
[8:58] so i want to spend a little bit of time
[8:59] on this you know
[9:02] james is telling us how this works a man
[9:05] is
[9:05] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[9:07] lust amen so
[9:09] with the devil the tool that the devil
[9:11] is working with when he's tempting us
[9:13] he's working with our own lusts and we
[9:16] have to recognize that that's why i call
[9:17] this discernment because i want to
[9:19] recognize his tactics brother bam said
[9:21] you have to know your enemy you study
[9:23] your enemy and he talked about in boxing
[9:25] and he also referred to it in war
[9:26] you study their moves and you know their
[9:28] tactics so you know how to fight
[9:30] and and we can study the tactics of the
[9:32] devil amen the best way to do that is
[9:34] from the word of god we've watched what
[9:36] he's done and how he's been defeated
[9:38] amen
[9:39] we can see how he's had victory but we
[9:40] can see how he's been defeated
[9:42] amen and we know what we ought to do in
[9:44] this hour
[9:45] let's turn to genesis chapter 3
[9:49] and we'll go all the way back to the
[9:50] beginning as i've said so often i've
[9:52] found that when i'm looking at something
[9:54] for me it's always helpful to go to the
[9:56] beginning genesis is the seed i mean
[9:59] it's the beginning everything
[10:01] started in genesis and so it's such a
[10:03] it's such a good place to start and see
[10:05] what's happened what god intended what
[10:07] went wrong
[10:08] what we're suffering with today amen
[10:12] let's go to genesis chapter 3 and begin
[10:14] at verse 1.
[10:16] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[10:17] beast of the field which the lord god
[10:19] had made
[10:20] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[10:22] said you shall not eat of every tree of
[10:25] the garden
[10:26] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[10:28] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[10:30] garden
[10:31] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[10:33] the midst of the garden god has said you
[10:34] shall not eat of it
[10:36] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[10:38] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[10:40] shall not
[10:41] surely die for god does know that in the
[10:44] day you eat thereof then your
[10:46] eyes shall be open and you shall be as
[10:48] gods
[10:49] knowing good and evil and when the woman
[10:52] saw that the tree was good for food
[10:55] lust of the flesh and it was pleasant to
[10:58] the eyes
[10:59] lust of the eyes and a tree to be
[11:01] desired to make one wise
[11:03] the pride of life when when
[11:06] now the woman is being tempted amen
[11:09] and this is the the beginning when we
[11:12] see
[11:13] that he come to not to adam but he come
[11:16] to
[11:17] the woman amen he come to the adam's
[11:20] bride
[11:20] and he came to her with the temptation
[11:23] and he starts off by saying
[11:25] god doesn't know amen god does know
[11:28] that you'll be as god's knowing good and
[11:30] evil you'll not surely die
[11:31] and he starts off contradicting the word
[11:34] amen and
[11:34] that contradiction should have been
[11:36] shocking enough
[11:38] to cause her to run away but after the
[11:40] contradiction
[11:42] he throws out a statement he said god
[11:44] doth know
[11:45] amen that the day you eat thereof then
[11:47] your eyes shall be opened and you shall
[11:49] be as gods knowing good and evil
[11:51] and all of a sudden what he did is he
[11:53] touched something in the woman
[11:54] amen and it created a desire a lust for
[11:57] knowledge
[11:58] a wanting to know and all of a sudden
[12:01] instead of rejoicing
[12:02] in all that god had given her and
[12:04] rejoicing in the garden
[12:06] and rejoicing in her mate and rejoicing
[12:09] in the perfection that
[12:10] surrounded her and then she began to fix
[12:12] on fixate on this point god is
[12:14] withholding something from me
[12:17] and see what the reason we want to know
[12:20] discernment so well
[12:21] is because i'm not you know i'm to the
[12:24] point now
[12:25] god has has really worked on me he's
[12:27] been molding me and molding me and i'm
[12:29] convinced there's a lot more molding
[12:30] that needs to take place
[12:32] but as he's molding me i'm no longer
[12:34] convinced with discernment out there
[12:37] are over there over there and you i'm
[12:39] interested in discerning what's going on
[12:41] right here
[12:42] the greatest battle ever fought is
[12:44] fought in the mind of man there's a
[12:45] battle waging between two forces in my
[12:47] mind
[12:48] and i need spiritual discernment to
[12:50] understand what's happening in me
[12:53] amen i i'm not i'm i'm i'm
[12:56] beyond trying to figure out what's wrong
[12:58] with everybody else
[13:00] i've done that so much you know and you
[13:03] say oh look they shouldn't have done
[13:04] that and they shouldn't have done that
[13:05] and if they wouldn't have done this then
[13:06] this wouldn't have happened
[13:07] look that's and the whole time i'm being
[13:11] tripped up by my own lust and tempted in
[13:13] my own lust
[13:14] amen and having all kinds of problems in
[13:17] my own life without any discernment in
[13:19] myself
[13:20] because i'm so good at discerning
[13:21] everybody else
[13:24] find out what's wrong with our mate and
[13:25] what's wrong with our children and the
[13:26] rest of the family and everybody else in
[13:28] the church and
[13:29] everybody at work and we've got them
[13:31] pinned down
[13:34] but that won't help you amen
[13:37] we've got to have spiritual discernment
[13:39] i say it like this if eve would have
[13:41] discerned herself she wouldn't have had
[13:43] to discern the serpent
[13:45] she didn't need to discern the serpent
[13:47] amen because the serpent was being
[13:50] influenced by the devil the devil was
[13:52] using the serpent to get to her
[13:54] she didn't even have to identify that
[13:56] you're being anointed of a devil she
[13:58] didn't even need that
[13:59] if she could just identify what was
[14:00] going on in herself she would know this
[14:02] is wrong
[14:06] because she now she she began to to
[14:09] hunger to lust to desire
[14:11] after something that god told her not to
[14:13] not to partake in
[14:15] and she was doing it and the devil was
[14:17] making as if
[14:18] god was holding something back from her
[14:20] when god had given them
[14:22] everything
[14:25] and isn't that what god does to us i
[14:26] mean what the devil does to us
[14:28] god's blessings abound in us he showers
[14:30] us with blessings showers us with
[14:32] privilege showers us with revelation
[14:34] and remember the devil will come and
[14:35] make us fixate on the thing that we're
[14:37] missing out on
[14:38] or don't have or isn't fixed yet
[14:44] amen what a what a devil
[14:47] and his tactics are good his tactics are
[14:50] highly refined
[14:52] remember it worked in heaven to deceive
[14:56] the angels
[14:57] and then it worked on earth and he's
[14:59] been he's been the mastermind behind the
[15:02] deception and
[15:03] he's been mastering it for 6 000 years
[15:05] with human beings
[15:06] that were of like passions as you amen
[15:10] and so he's got he's got you figured out
[15:14] and whatever personality type you are
[15:17] you can say i'm an introvert i'm an
[15:18] extrovert i'm an a-type i'm a b-type
[15:20] whatever personality you are he has
[15:22] deceived thousands
[15:24] millions of your type
[15:30] so discernment must come by the word
[15:33] and so if eve would have just understood
[15:36] what was going on
[15:38] she should have never entertained the
[15:39] idea she should have never given her
[15:41] mind
[15:42] over to exploring the possibilities amen
[15:44] and
[15:45] but when she did because she was enticed
[15:48] of her own lust
[15:49] he awakened the desire inside of eve and
[15:52] now eve wanted to know something he
[15:54] meant she wanted
[15:55] to be like god and now he's coming down
[15:58] and
[15:58] he's coming right down to her
[16:00] identification of who she is
[16:03] because he comes down and says god does
[16:05] though that the day you eat there of
[16:06] your bs gods
[16:08] and she was already as a god upon the
[16:11] earth adam
[16:12] amen adam was the god of the earth adam
[16:14] and his mate together were joint heirs
[16:17] of the creation they were in the garden
[16:19] ruling and reigning they were gods upon
[16:21] the earth
[16:22] but now amen the sir that the devil
[16:24] comes in
[16:25] and he begins to question her very
[16:28] position
[16:31] and begins to go right to the foundation
[16:35] and right say now god knows that if
[16:38] if you if you eat thereof amen if you
[16:41] partake in this your eyes will be up
[16:42] and then you'll be as gods knowing good
[16:45] and evil amen and he was taking her
[16:47] identity away from her
[16:50] and trying to give it back to her by
[16:52] leaving the word
[16:58] you'll be his gods what was she
[17:02] what was adam what were they upon the
[17:04] earth they were amateur gods
[17:08] but now the devil has stripped her
[17:10] identity away
[17:12] and he's created in her a need now she
[17:16] needs her identity she needs to be as a
[17:19] god
[17:23] we may not think that happens to us but
[17:25] it happens to us all the time
[17:28] we'll explore that as we go and i hope
[17:29] god will reveal it to you as we move
[17:31] forward in this
[17:33] so now because now there's a need in her
[17:37] now she senses that there's a lacking
[17:40] and her identity is in question but she
[17:43] can be as
[17:44] god if shall partake in this and have
[17:46] her eyes open
[17:47] amen and shall know good and evil amen
[17:49] and you realize
[17:50] that that the knowledge of good and evil
[17:52] was not something that god
[17:54] wanted his children to have amen because
[17:56] the knowledge of good and evil
[17:58] came by pain
[18:03] it came by pain because
[18:06] because god when he come down amen and
[18:10] he began to to correct his children then
[18:13] he had to put a
[18:14] a cherubim with flaming swords at the
[18:17] eastern gate of eden
[18:18] amen to prevent them from coming and
[18:20] getting the tree of life and living
[18:22] forever
[18:23] because he says god says now man has
[18:26] become as one of us
[18:30] knowing good and evil
[18:33] satan portrayed it as the end all once
[18:36] you know good and evil you'll be his god
[18:38] amen because there was a fall in heaven
[18:40] there was evil discovered in heaven
[18:42] there was now good and evil that had
[18:44] taken place in heaven
[18:45] and god comes down and says now we we
[18:48] must
[18:49] because they've become the man has
[18:50] become like one of us knowing good and
[18:52] evil
[18:53] amen let's put this flaming cherubim
[18:55] here so that they don't have to live
[18:57] eternal that way
[19:01] because heaven was in a condition
[19:06] and god had recreated on the earth
[19:09] a perfect condition without the
[19:11] knowledge of good and evil
[19:13] but the war that was in heaven was now
[19:15] spilling down into earth
[19:19] and the devil was taking the very thing
[19:23] that god had made for perfection for his
[19:26] children
[19:27] the very love expressed to his children
[19:29] to allow his attributes to be expressed
[19:32] in an arena now without good and evil
[19:37] without a fall yet there was a fall in
[19:39] heaven but not yet here
[19:41] in eden amen and he set this arena where
[19:44] there was not knowledge of good and evil
[19:46] it was just good
[19:50] and that was his love expressed to his
[19:51] children but
[19:53] the the serpent would come now and take
[19:56] god's great love
[19:57] amen and turn it evil
[20:01] saying god is withholding from you
[20:04] but the thing god was withholding with
[20:06] them was because of his great love
[20:10] and now they they would become like gods
[20:13] knowing
[20:14] good and evil and because of that they
[20:16] were driven from the garden
[20:18] man was cursed the earth was cursed
[20:21] everything happened
[20:22] and so now when the the devil had taken
[20:25] and
[20:26] and planted this thought into her mind
[20:28] and now
[20:29] now she because she now has a need now
[20:32] there's a question of identification
[20:35] now the question of who she is now who
[20:38] she is
[20:38] is in question and because who she is in
[20:40] question
[20:41] now she turns to observe the tree
[20:45] before it's as if when you read the
[20:47] scripture she never considered the tree
[20:49] she never looked at it deeply she never
[20:51] spent some time considering it
[20:52] because in the scripture it says verse 6
[20:56] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[20:58] good for food
[20:59] now all of a sudden she's looking at it
[21:01] and considering it in a different light
[21:03] good for food and that it was pleasant
[21:05] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[21:06] make one wise
[21:07] she took her the fruit they were of and
[21:09] did eat and gave also into her husband
[21:11] with her
[21:11] and he did he so now she turned and she
[21:14] began to look at the tree
[21:16] and when she looked at the tree amen she
[21:18] could not
[21:20] discern anything wrong in what she saw
[21:24] you realize she couldn't identify
[21:27] the problem with the tree
[21:31] this is so important they couldn't see
[21:34] anything wrong it was good for food
[21:37] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[21:39] to be desired to make one wise
[21:41] she didn't realize she couldn't find
[21:42] anything wrong with the tree what was
[21:44] wrong with the tree
[21:45] is the commandment of the lord not to
[21:46] partake thereof
[21:48] that was the problem it wasn't that you
[21:50] could observe the tree
[21:52] and identify the tree and dissect the
[21:54] tree and find out what's wrong with the
[21:55] tree
[21:56] amen that's going completely backwards
[21:59] she wasn't even supposed to consider it
[22:01] observe it amen analyze it
[22:03] find the fault in it amen it wasn't for
[22:05] her to find the fault in it
[22:07] god had already said don't partake
[22:12] so now by wisdom he begins to sow and
[22:14] turn knowledge and it sows into her
[22:15] wisdom
[22:16] and by wisdom she begins to look at the
[22:18] tree and in her own wisdom because she
[22:20] already desires
[22:21] to be like god the desire was already
[22:25] awakened
[22:26] the identity crisis had already begun
[22:29] and under that now she's looking at the
[22:31] tree and you realize
[22:33] now oh i hope that what's in my heart
[22:36] could come across
[22:37] now because she's an identity crisis her
[22:40] position is in question
[22:41] and god is withholding from her now when
[22:43] she looks at the tree
[22:45] she needs the tree to be good
[22:51] she needs the tree to be good because
[22:54] she's got a problem she's lacking
[22:56] and she wants to rise amen to the level
[22:58] of a god
[22:59] and so now she looks at the tree
[23:01] differently than she's ever looked at it
[23:03] before
[23:03] because before she would walk past from
[23:05] the tree she didn't need the tree
[23:07] she had god she had fellowship with god
[23:09] she had her mate she had perfection but
[23:11] all of a sudden the devil took away her
[23:13] identity now she needed something and
[23:14] she looks at the tree
[23:16] with a need deep inside and now she sees
[23:18] the tree as good
[23:24] we need discernment in this hour
[23:28] this is the hour amen when christ has
[23:31] already come
[23:32] and stood his temptation and he is
[23:33] overcome by the word but he's restored
[23:37] back an eve amen the second eve who's
[23:40] not going to fall by disbelieving the
[23:42] word and she's going to stand in her
[23:44] tempting her trials her testing time and
[23:46] she's going to have to have spiritual
[23:48] discernment by the word but the
[23:50] discernment all
[23:51] out there is not going to work i can
[23:53] discern that homosexuality is wrong i
[23:55] can discern that our school system is
[23:57] failing
[23:57] i can discern that the government is
[23:59] falling apart but what i
[24:00] need to do is discern amen where the
[24:03] devil is trying to get
[24:04] me off the word trying to get me amen
[24:06] with an identity crisis trying to get me
[24:08] to look at what i'm not supposed to look
[24:10] at
[24:12] because that's where real overcoming is
[24:13] in this hour when this bride overcomes
[24:16] amen it'll reverse what was done in the
[24:18] first one
[24:22] that's why god has opened the word to us
[24:23] in this hour so we can see things like
[24:25] we've never seen them before
[24:29] the woman saw the tree was good for food
[24:34] that it was pleasant pleasant to the
[24:35] eyes
[24:37] you know when god gave the commandment
[24:38] for adam not to partake of that tree
[24:41] he never he never said
[24:44] it wasn't good for food and it didn't
[24:46] look good and it didn't make you wise
[24:49] all of these things could have been
[24:51] perfectly true
[24:54] none of what she's seeing may be false
[24:56] or in any way
[24:58] a false observation
[25:01] the problem was there was already a
[25:03] commandment said don't
[25:06] and that's where she failed
[25:10] now you realize eve didn't want to fall
[25:13] eve didn't want to fail
[25:15] she wanted to do right she wanted to do
[25:17] good and then she
[25:19] she was beguiled she was deceived
[25:22] into this
[25:25] brother ben said in the message putting
[25:28] on the whole armor of god from 1962
[25:31] now we find that this great enemy of god
[25:33] thought now as long as they will believe
[25:35] that word i can never get to them
[25:38] as long as that little family in eden
[25:39] keeps behind that word i can never touch
[25:41] to him
[25:42] neither can he today amen he is still
[25:44] blocked off that's right
[25:46] but if i can use some real good a
[25:48] strategy and just
[25:49] reason out i give some human reasonings
[25:52] because
[25:52] she's human and i can just give human
[25:55] reasonings then
[25:56] we'll we'll win the battle satan and his
[25:58] angels but then
[25:59] eve gave away so therefore we know our
[26:02] enemy by his tactics
[26:04] so what we want to study this morning we
[26:06] know the enemy by his
[26:08] ta by his attacks i'm sorry he said we
[26:10] know the enemy by his attacks
[26:12] maybe you didn't get it just right the
[26:13] way i said it we know our enemy
[26:16] when anyone any spirit any person tries
[26:18] to disagree with god's word remember
[26:21] that's your enemy that's your enemy
[26:24] we know his old attack that's the one he
[26:26] broke the human race down and
[26:28] that's the way he breaks them down yet
[26:30] today and that's the way he gets you
[26:32] away from god is to
[26:33] disbelieve his word and the only way
[26:35] that you can ever stay in fellowship
[26:37] with god and talk to him in the cool of
[26:39] the evening
[26:39] is stay fortified in the word let the
[26:42] curtain of god's word drop
[26:43] all around you and you be a
[26:46] and you be a drop right in the middle of
[26:48] it that's right then you're fortified
[26:50] now in order to do this he has to make
[26:53] it very
[26:53] appealing reasonings and that's the way
[26:56] satan does
[26:57] he's good at the job and he's a good
[26:59] adversary and he makes it appealing
[27:01] he had to make it appealing to eve
[27:05] i'd like to say in this hour if you're
[27:07] going to trip up the bride of jesus
[27:08] christ
[27:09] you better make it very appealing
[27:14] so is he stopped trying to trip up the
[27:16] bride of christ
[27:18] or is he really good at making it very
[27:20] appealing
[27:23] as if there's ever an hour we need
[27:25] discernment this is the hour
[27:27] if there's ever a time that the devil is
[27:29] unleashing every tactic he has to try to
[27:31] hinder somebody
[27:32] amen who would he rather hinder in what
[27:34] age amen than try to stop this bride
[27:36] from coming to full maturity in full
[27:38] manifestation
[27:39] and to take all of the word and stay on
[27:41] the word in the word only amen
[27:43] because brother bam said if he can get
[27:45] one subject to let down on one word then
[27:47] he's got victory over the word of god
[27:51] this is the hour we need spiritual
[27:54] discernment by the word
[27:57] in the message fellowship the prophet of
[28:00] god says when god made
[28:02] a man in the beginning to fellowship
[28:03] with him then this man was in perfect
[28:06] fellowship in the garden of eden
[28:07] he was in perfect fellowship with god
[28:09] and how it must have been on that day
[28:11] when god would come down in the cool of
[28:12] the evening and call adam
[28:14] he and eve would come up and they would
[28:16] worship god and they would fellowship
[28:18] and commune one with the other the
[28:21] reason i
[28:22] i put this in here because i wanted to
[28:23] see how brother brahm described the
[28:24] relationship in the garden
[28:26] because i think it's interesting to note
[28:28] that when
[28:29] the serpent began to deceive the woman
[28:32] and then she began
[28:34] to to take what he was saying and reason
[28:37] it and consider it and knowledge and
[28:38] wisdom
[28:39] and she began to be deceived beguiled by
[28:42] that reasoning
[28:43] and she began to hunger amen to to be
[28:46] like god she there was a lust that came
[28:48] up in her
[28:49] she began to observe the tree and
[28:51] analyze the tree
[28:52] amen i'd like to say it this way if her
[28:54] motives had been completely pure
[28:59] why didn't she wait and ask the father
[29:00] in the cool of the evening
[29:05] she was deceived and thought she was
[29:07] doing right
[29:09] but why not just wait till the father
[29:11] comes down the fellowship until you go
[29:13] to the cathedral and have church and he
[29:14] comes down like brother benham said
[29:16] says children have you enjoyed your day
[29:18] in the garden today
[29:20] why couldn't she have said adam do you
[29:22] know you know this and the serpent told
[29:25] me that and you know this and and can we
[29:27] ask the father when he comes
[29:32] amen this is the very reason some kids
[29:35] won't ask permission from their parents
[29:36] before they do something
[29:40] and then afterwards you say why did you
[29:41] do that well i didn't know you never
[29:43] said
[29:43] why didn't you ask i didn't think to ask
[29:45] yeah you didn't think to ask this is why
[29:54] some people won't ask their pastor
[29:57] won't look up the quotes
[30:01] why because really they don't want to
[30:06] know
[30:08] see we can deceive one another but we
[30:11] can't deceive god and we really
[30:13] have a hard time deceiving ourselves we
[30:15] just keep the truth buried deep
[30:18] we want to be able to say when caught i
[30:20] didn't know
[30:23] but what's the reality deep in our
[30:25] hearts amen that's what god wants
[30:27] god wants something real not a where
[30:30] this is we're
[30:31] far past the age of a church walk and a
[30:33] group thing
[30:34] and just going through the motions god
[30:36] is after reality amen there's going to
[30:38] be real sons of daughters of god on this
[30:40] earth in this hour
[30:41] and they're going to live a real life
[30:42] amen it may not be perfect but it's
[30:44] going to be real
[30:46] when they get it wrong they're going to
[30:47] confess they're wrong they're going to
[30:49] go to god with weepings and say god
[30:51] there was me amen i was wrong i did
[30:54] wrong
[30:54] i had the wrong desire i was tempted and
[30:56] led away by enticed by my own lust
[31:00] god's going to have a real church
[31:02] friends the games of church are over
[31:06] the days of playing games are over who
[31:08] do much is given much is required and we
[31:10] have received
[31:11] much in this hour and the church game
[31:13] and churchiani and church walk is done
[31:16] god is wanting sons and daughters of god
[31:19] who will be real amen who will be
[31:21] genuine
[31:22] amen who will confess their faults and
[31:24] be real with themselves and have real
[31:26] spiritual discernment
[31:27] in their own lives and say where am i
[31:30] really amen what is it i really
[31:32] want why do i want this to be true so
[31:34] much why do i want that to be true
[31:36] why do i want this to be okay
[31:42] these are good questions you know the
[31:45] devil's got us in such a
[31:47] a rat race where we move so fast that we
[31:50] don't meditate
[31:55] because how many times have you done
[31:57] something and
[31:58] blundered and made a mistake and said if
[32:00] i would have just stopped for five
[32:02] minutes
[32:04] i hope i'm not the only one if i would
[32:06] have just stopped
[32:08] and for five minutes and considering my
[32:09] ways you realize this is why
[32:12] amen we we have to actively unplug
[32:15] we have to make a decision to say i've
[32:17] got to spend time with the lord
[32:19] i have to meditate because everywhere
[32:22] around me is trapped trapped trap trap
[32:24] trap trap trap trap trap
[32:26] it's like we're tiptoeing through a
[32:28] minefield and man it's like we're
[32:29] walking through
[32:30] a house full of mousetraps
[32:33] and without spiritual discernment and
[32:35] godly leadership in our lives we're
[32:37] going to step into them
[32:39] and they're painful will we be a son of
[32:42] god absolutely you're still a son of god
[32:43] you're a son of god with a sore leg
[32:48] you're a son of god with regrets you're
[32:50] a son of god with disappointment in your
[32:51] life because you disappointed the lord
[32:54] you're still a son of god but you're a
[32:56] son of god who's suffering
[32:57] amen because we didn't take the time to
[33:00] meditate consider the word
[33:02] where the word is on every decision
[33:05] we start using reasoning and and
[33:08] following somebody else i tell you
[33:10] that's one of the most dangerous things
[33:11] you can ever do is father
[33:12] follow somebody else well i know they're
[33:14] a good believer
[33:16] i know they're a good believer that may
[33:19] be fine and what they're doing may be
[33:21] fine
[33:23] but that's not your justification for
[33:25] repeating the same thing
[33:29] god wants preeminence in this hour and
[33:32] preeminence is total control
[33:34] in first place and there's a bride on
[33:37] the earth that wants him to have that
[33:39] i believe you all want him to have that
[33:41] i want him to have that but what do i
[33:43] have to do
[33:43] i've got to slow down and spend some
[33:45] more time
[33:46] with the lord more time in meditation
[33:48] more time considering
[33:50] my ways
[33:53] brother rem says in satan's eden from
[33:55] 1965
[33:56] now satan this deceiver is spoken in
[33:59] matthew 24 24
[34:00] with so much deceit now we find that by
[34:03] his gospel programs of knowledge
[34:05] better education higher ethics
[34:06] civilization and so forth
[34:08] has bewitched the people that wants to
[34:10] serve god into believing his lie
[34:15] eve did not want to do that but but he
[34:17] showed her how it was a more wisdom in
[34:19] it
[34:20] she didn't know she wanted to know she
[34:23] didn't understand
[34:24] she wanted to understand and god told
[34:28] her not to try
[34:29] to understand god wanted her to just
[34:33] obey
[34:34] not understand but she wanted to
[34:36] understand
[34:38] and the devil planted that seed and
[34:41] manipulated that seed
[34:43] and got her to look at the tree
[34:46] and she didn't look at the tree in the
[34:49] light of the commandment
[34:51] she looked at the tree in the light of
[34:53] her wisdom
[34:55] and knowledge but when she was looking
[34:57] at the tree in the light of her wisdom
[34:59] and knowledge
[35:00] she was doing it with lust already
[35:02] having awakened
[35:06] it's amazing when we go back and look
[35:08] over our lives and i'm sure
[35:10] you all are just like me and i'm just
[35:12] like you and there's no real difference
[35:13] between us
[35:15] other than the day we were born in the
[35:16] name we have whether we're male or
[35:19] female
[35:20] but we all have the same tendencies
[35:23] i can look back
[35:26] i look back on decisions i made and
[35:28] things that i've done
[35:30] and i shudder how could i have done that
[35:34] like now it's so obviously wrong
[35:38] now it is so i see it so clear
[35:41] why why would i ever be so deceived why
[35:44] and
[35:44] you know we say it like this why would i
[35:46] be so dumb
[35:48] why did i do that and cause myself pain
[35:51] and grief that i have today
[35:52] why didn't i just this and why didn't
[35:54] why because if you could place yourself
[35:56] back there
[35:57] what happened is you were led away of
[35:59] your own lust and enticed
[36:01] amen and the reason you did it is
[36:03] because something in you was already
[36:04] awakened and
[36:05] wanted to do it and now
[36:09] a year ten years five years down the
[36:11] road amen you don't want to do that
[36:13] anymore and it's so obvious that that is
[36:15] wrong
[36:17] but back then you were taking and
[36:18] splicing ideas and concepts and religion
[36:22] together
[36:25] amen you were you were cutting and
[36:27] pasting and and
[36:28] molding and manipulating the message in
[36:30] the and the bible
[36:32] to try to bring justification to your
[36:34] actions
[36:36] because there's something we already
[36:39] wanted
[36:40] and because there was something we
[36:41] already wanted we were willing
[36:44] amen to look at the tree again
[36:47] and when we looked at it again this time
[36:50] we couldn't see really anything wrong
[36:52] with it
[36:55] could you imagine eve's regrets 10 years
[36:58] 20 years 30 years later
[37:00] 100 years later
[37:04] see that's why i love this word and this
[37:06] message so much
[37:08] the message of the hour has taken this
[37:09] bible and made it alive to me right now
[37:12] it's not something that happened over
[37:14] there this is something that's happening
[37:15] in me daily this is happening all the
[37:17] time
[37:18] amen i'm right here in genesis chapter
[37:20] 3.
[37:22] you're right in genesis chapter 3 amen
[37:25] and
[37:26] it's time to have some discernment our
[37:28] eyes open amen
[37:29] we have the benefit of being able by a
[37:31] prophetic gift to look
[37:33] back over all of the scripture and see
[37:35] the whole plan and the whole purpose of
[37:37] god
[37:37] and every mistake and all that was the
[37:39] result of that and now we stand here in
[37:41] this day
[37:42] in a position that nobody else has been
[37:43] able to stand in amen and god has
[37:45] equipped us and he's given us his word
[37:47] we need to depend on it to rely on it to
[37:50] feed on it to meditate on it so that we
[37:52] have the tools to overcome the devil's
[37:54] tactics
[37:55] it's going to be by the word amen
[38:00] so let's turn to matthew chapter four
[38:05] i want to look at jesus's temptation in
[38:06] the wilderness
[38:13] and if you just bear with me and allow
[38:14] me i'd like to break it down and bring
[38:16] it home
[38:17] personal to us
[38:24] now
[38:31] let's look at chapter four verse one
[38:34] then was jesus led up of the spirit into
[38:36] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[38:37] devil
[38:39] boy that doesn't sound like that was
[38:40] very nice of the holy spirit
[38:46] i thought when i got the holy ghost
[38:47] everything was going to be good
[38:50] jesus was led up of the spirit into the
[38:53] wilderness this is immediately after his
[38:54] baptism
[38:56] immediately after the light comes down
[38:59] god says this is my
[39:00] son in whom i'm well pleased immediately
[39:02] after his baptism he meant in his
[39:03] experience
[39:04] amen he the spirit leads him into the
[39:06] wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[39:09] and i'll ask you this question
[39:12] which devil tempts you a different one
[39:16] than tempted jesus
[39:18] or the same one you see it's the same
[39:22] devil that tempted him
[39:25] is the same one that through the serpent
[39:27] tempted eve
[39:29] and it's the same one that's coming to
[39:30] tempt you
[39:32] so why are we trying to use reasoning
[39:34] and logic and modern understanding and
[39:36] laodicean mentality
[39:38] to fight the devil let's come back to
[39:40] the word because whatever worked will
[39:42] always work
[39:44] and what failed before will fail again
[39:46] but what worked before will work again
[39:48] amen
[39:49] because it's the same spirit it's the
[39:51] same devils it's the
[39:52] it's the same satan nothing is different
[39:54] they're all the same
[39:57] so we want to know what to do in this
[39:59] hour and we want to know what he's doing
[40:02] verse 2 and when he had fasted 40 days
[40:04] and 40 nights he was afterward
[40:06] hungered i want you to see the condition
[40:08] of jesus
[40:09] now he had been fasting 40 days and 40
[40:11] nights and brother branham said
[40:12] when you're fasting you're not hungry
[40:15] but this was
[40:16] after the fast and now
[40:19] he was hungry he was in
[40:22] a weakened physical condition he was now
[40:26] hungry and when the tempter came to him
[40:29] he said if thou be the son of god
[40:31] command these stones to be made bread
[40:34] but he answered and said it is written
[40:36] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[40:38] every word that proceedeth out of the
[40:41] mouth of god
[40:43] so here we find
[40:47] jesus in a weakened condition he had
[40:50] come to the river he had been baptized
[40:52] he had this great spiritual baptism when
[40:55] the when god himself came down the holy
[40:57] spirit as a dove
[40:58] descended upon him made the declaration
[41:00] this is the son in whom i'm well pleased
[41:03] amen and the spirit leads him to the
[41:04] wilderness to be tempting
[41:06] 40 days with no food but afterward he
[41:08] was hungry
[41:09] so now he's in the wilderness 40 days
[41:11] since he's eaten now his body has become
[41:13] hungry
[41:14] and the devil comes to him and says if
[41:16] you be the son of god
[41:18] amen make these stones into bread
[41:22] the lust of the flesh
[41:26] now it may we read through these things
[41:30] sometimes and they just seem
[41:32] so we just read it we've read it and we
[41:34] read it and it's so quick to read across
[41:36] but
[41:36] when we really bring it home i want to i
[41:38] want to look at it this way
[41:41] if you be the son of god turn these
[41:44] stones to bread
[41:46] because you're hungry and jesus was
[41:49] hungry
[41:50] and why would a son of god have to
[41:52] suffer
[41:53] if you're a son of god then just turn to
[41:55] stones to bread and end your suffering
[41:59] because you know these tactics that he's
[42:01] using he uses against
[42:02] us too amen if you're a son of god why
[42:05] are you sick if you're a son of god
[42:06] why do you have a financial need if
[42:08] you're a son if you're a son of god
[42:10] amen just fix it it should be fixed
[42:14] but you can be a son of god and be
[42:16] hungry
[42:17] and you can be a son of god and be sick
[42:20] and you can be a son of god and have a
[42:21] financial need
[42:22] and you can be a son of god and be in
[42:24] prison and you can be a son of god and
[42:26] be stoned
[42:27] and you can be a son of god
[42:30] and be all of the above amen you can be
[42:32] a son of god
[42:33] and to be no food in the wilderness amen
[42:35] and god amen is not providing you food
[42:38] in the wilderness
[42:39] amen just so you can withstand the
[42:41] temptation of fixing the problem
[42:43] yourself
[42:44] believing that as a son of god i
[42:46] shouldn't suffer
[42:52] that's a temptation friends that's the
[42:55] temptation when you don't have the cash
[42:57] to buy something and you pull out your
[42:58] credit card
[42:59] it's the same temptation
[43:02] providing something amen i shouldn't
[43:05] have to suffer
[43:06] i should have this i need this i want
[43:08] this if you need it god will provide it
[43:12] i'm not against using a credit card i'm
[43:14] using a credit i'm against using a
[43:16] credit card in place of the money
[43:20] credit card should be used because you
[43:22] got money in the bank but you can't get
[43:23] to it right now you're going to use the
[43:24] credit card and take the money out of
[43:25] the bank and pay it off
[43:28] it shouldn't be used to you know
[43:31] you know citibank is not your provider
[43:34] god is
[43:38] amen we do a lot better off if we let
[43:42] god be our provider and quit trying to
[43:43] fix it ourselves because we think we
[43:44] shouldn't suffer
[43:47] and we're everyone guilty of it and i'm
[43:51] not intending on preaching on credit
[43:52] cards
[43:52] that's not my point today but i'm just
[43:55] showing how
[43:56] how we're tempted you know we feel like
[43:59] well we're
[44:00] we you know by a title we have a
[44:01] position of privilege and
[44:03] in that position of privilege i mean
[44:04] there should be uh no suffering god take
[44:06] care of me god wants me to be happy and
[44:08] we may not verbalize all of that but
[44:10] those are the temptations that are
[44:12] coming this way
[44:12] and sometimes god has you as the son of
[44:15] god and he wants you to be
[44:17] unhappy for a season uncomfortable
[44:21] for a season
[44:25] god could have rained manna in the
[44:27] wilderness jesus could have come out of
[44:28] us fast
[44:29] and had manna in the wilderness
[44:35] but where would the trial and temptation
[44:37] have been
[44:38] where would the overcoming
[44:41] so jesus overcomes by the word he said
[44:44] his written man shall not live by bread
[44:46] alone but by
[44:46] every word that proceedeth out of the
[44:48] mouth of god then the devil taketh him
[44:51] up into a holy city
[44:52] and sitteth him on the pinnacle of the
[44:54] temple and saith unto him if thou
[44:55] be the son of god cast thyself down for
[44:58] it is written
[44:58] he shall give his angels charge
[45:00] concerning thee and in their hands they
[45:03] shall bear thee up lest at any time thou
[45:04] shalt dash thy foot against the stone
[45:07] and jesus said unto him it is written
[45:10] again thou shalt not
[45:11] tempt the lord thy god now he comes to
[45:14] jesus
[45:16] and he tries to get him to prove his
[45:18] sonship
[45:21] he tries he tries first he tries to get
[45:24] him to provide for himself
[45:28] then he tries to get him to prove his
[45:29] sonship
[45:31] if thou be the son of god
[45:35] if you if you are who you say you are
[45:39] throw yourself down from this pinnacle
[45:41] because the scripture says
[45:43] who gives the angels charge over you
[45:44] what's he he's using the bible
[45:48] i don't know if you've ever been tempted
[45:50] by bible verses
[45:52] or quotes but i have
[45:58] jesus could have taken that bible verse
[46:01] because it was a bible verse and jumped
[46:04] on that bait
[46:05] but he didn't have the leadership of the
[46:06] father
[46:08] he waited for god he didn't make his own
[46:11] decisions he didn't do his own bit he
[46:13] didn't do his own thing he waited for
[46:14] god's bidding
[46:15] he knew how to be an obedient son he
[46:17] knew how that how to give
[46:19] preeminence unto the father amen and so
[46:21] now the devil is trying to get
[46:23] him to move of his own accord amen to
[46:26] prove that he's the son of god and jesus
[46:28] doesn't take debate because he has
[46:30] nothing to prove
[46:32] listen if we could just really get down
[46:35] amen down to business with this amen
[46:38] that you if god has called you filled
[46:40] you with the spirit if god has
[46:41] identified himself to you
[46:43] you have nothing to prove
[46:48] you'd be shocked if we really had time
[46:50] to meditate on it and bring out
[46:52] circumstances
[46:53] you'd be shocked how many times were
[46:54] moved into action and move to make
[46:56] decisions
[46:56] because we're trying to prove who we are
[47:00] and the devil will bring pressure it'll
[47:02] bring a certain pressure in certain
[47:04] circumstances into our life
[47:05] amen and try to get us to jump into
[47:07] action to do something
[47:09] amen just to prove that we're a believer
[47:11] you know if you're a believer you'll do
[47:12] that if you're a believer you'll say
[47:13] that if you're a believer you'll believe
[47:15] this
[47:17] and we go ahead of god but i don't want
[47:20] to get ahead of god
[47:22] i want to be right where god is
[47:26] if thou be the son of god cast thyself
[47:28] down for it is written
[47:29] he shall give his angels charged
[47:31] concerning thee
[47:34] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[47:36] up lest at any time thou shalt dash thy
[47:37] foot against the stone
[47:40] oh i'm telling you friends that's a hard
[47:42] one that
[47:43] that is real bait right there amen
[47:46] taking the
[47:46] the very scriptures and jesus christ is
[47:49] the very manifestation of the word and
[47:50] the devil's using the very scriptures
[47:52] and what's he trying to do first he's
[47:54] doubting his identity
[47:56] and trying to lure jesus into having
[47:59] needing to prove his identity that's the
[48:02] same thing he did with eve back there
[48:03] and it says
[48:04] amen if you if god doesn't know that if
[48:06] you take this fruit then you'll be as
[48:08] gods and she was already as a god
[48:11] and jesus was already son of god but but
[48:13] the devil is putting a doubt he's saying
[48:16] if thou be the son of god amen and you i
[48:19] wonder
[48:20] you have to ask yourself this question
[48:21] he said if thou be son of god
[48:23] cast myself down for the scripture says
[48:25] this it'll be the fulfillment of the
[48:26] scripture
[48:27] i ask you if jesus would have thrown
[48:29] himself down and the angels would have
[48:30] caught him before he hit
[48:31] would the devil have turned into a
[48:32] believer and stopped asking questions
[48:36] would that have been his last question
[48:37] would that have been the evidence to
[48:39] prove that the devil needed to say yep
[48:41] you are the son of god
[48:44] if we would have done that then the next
[48:46] one would be another question well the
[48:47] other scripture says
[48:49] and another scripture says and another
[48:51] scripture said i tell you friends don't
[48:53] go down this road amen trying to prove
[48:55] your identity
[48:56] your identity comes through a new birth
[48:58] through a personal experience of you and
[49:00] jesus christ
[49:01] individuals together and you know that
[49:03] he come and he got you amen
[49:05] he called you well he brought you to
[49:07] himself and united himself with you
[49:09] that's your identification and nothing
[49:11] else
[49:14] amen that life then produces evidence of
[49:17] the life then there's workings that come
[49:19] out
[49:19] of that life amen but you cannot go amen
[49:22] to the workings amen
[49:24] to prove to yourself that you're son of
[49:25] god you've got to go back to the
[49:27] experience of meeting jesus christ
[49:29] personally yourself
[49:35] the devil will tempt
[49:38] us into trying to act like believers
[49:43] act like we have faith take a step of
[49:46] faith with no leadership
[49:49] no godly leadership no will of the
[49:52] father
[49:52] but try to take a step that god's not
[49:54] asking us to take
[49:57] to prove that we're believers
[50:01] try how many people have tried
[50:04] to act nice and be sweet to prove
[50:06] they're a believer
[50:09] how many have tried a reformed life
[50:13] to prove because if you're a believer
[50:15] you'll love everybody
[50:18] if you're a believer how many people
[50:20] come to church when they absolutely
[50:22] don't want to be here because
[50:24] a real christian can't wait for the
[50:25] doors to be open
[50:29] [Laughter]
[50:32] it's the truth these are temptations
[50:37] amen if christ had to deal with them if
[50:39] eve had to deal with it then you and i
[50:41] have to deal with it
[50:43] and we need to have discernment to
[50:46] understand what's going on in
[50:47] us amen not all around us in us why am i
[50:50] feeling pressured to have to do
[50:52] something to prove who i am
[50:54] that's the devil then you could say get
[50:57] thee behind me satan
[50:58] i'm a son of god by the calling of god
[51:01] by by the foreign nation of god i've
[51:02] been predestined my name's written in
[51:04] the lamb's book of life and god revealed
[51:06] it to me personally
[51:07] i don't have to prove anything to
[51:09] anybody
[51:12] scripture says if you resist the devil
[51:14] he will
[51:15] flee i wonder how many people
[51:19] live a life daily trying to prove
[51:21] they're a believer
[51:24] what a miserable way to live
[51:28] believers are supposed to be believers
[51:29] because of a new birth because a change
[51:32] in the soul a new life a new nature the
[51:34] old one's gone
[51:35] and all of a sudden things just begin to
[51:37] change
[51:39] it's not a reformation it's a new life
[51:42] now it doesn't take away your need to
[51:44] make choices that align with the word
[51:46] you're still given pre-moral agency
[51:47] it doesn't mean that you don't obey the
[51:49] word but what it means is by
[51:52] by just simply obeying you'll never
[51:55] prove whether or not you're a son or
[51:56] daughter of god
[51:58] to yourself the only way you'll know is
[52:02] that experience where god himself
[52:04] reveals to you who he is
[52:07] and who you are in him and then who can
[52:11] take that away
[52:13] the devil will try other people may try
[52:15] how many has had the devil try to take
[52:17] that away from
[52:18] you he tried to take it away from eve he
[52:20] tried to take it away from jesus he'll
[52:22] try to take it away from you
[52:23] but you've got to have an experience
[52:25] that holds like an anchor that says no
[52:26] i know i met my savior i know it's real
[52:29] and i know who i
[52:30] am not because i'm worthy not because of
[52:33] my efforts not because of what i'd done
[52:34] but because he revealed to me my name
[52:36] was on the book before the foundation of
[52:38] the world it's not what i did it's what
[52:39] he did for me amen
[52:42] that's who i am by a personal
[52:45] identification
[52:46] of jesus christ revealed personally to
[52:48] me
[52:50] and so now we don't have when that
[52:52] temptation comes i say reject it in the
[52:54] name of jesus christ
[52:56] the next time you feel the need to prove
[52:58] i feel the need i've got to do this i've
[53:00] got to have this dynamic kind of
[53:02] outcropping or i have to have this
[53:04] supernatural kind of thing and i have to
[53:06] have this to prove who i am
[53:08] no god tells you who you are and that's
[53:10] who you always are
[53:11] always where always will be
[53:15] and then as christ lives his life
[53:17] through you he does
[53:19] what he needs to do at the time
[53:21] according to his purpose
[53:23] but it's for his purpose not for your
[53:26] identification he's already given
[53:28] you your identification
[53:32] i want to back up let's go back to
[53:34] matthew
[53:36] let's go at the beginning of chapter
[53:38] four
[53:41] am i going to go up two verses to verse
[53:43] 16 chapter 3 verse 16.
[53:46] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[53:48] straight out of the water and lo the
[53:50] heavens were open unto him and he saw
[53:52] the spirit of god descending like a dove
[53:54] and lighting upon him and lo a voice
[53:56] from heaven saying this is my beloved
[53:58] son in whom
[53:59] i am well pleased
[54:02] then he's led of the spirit into the
[54:04] wilderness and this is this devil's
[54:06] second
[54:07] second statement if thou be the son of
[54:09] god cast yourself
[54:10] why would he have to cast himself down
[54:12] from a pinnacle there was a ball of fire
[54:14] that came from heaven
[54:15] from god and said this is my son in whom
[54:18] i'm well pleased
[54:20] why does he have to jump through the
[54:21] devil's hoops to prove anything
[54:26] i tell you if you start trying to prove
[54:28] who you are
[54:29] amen to somebody who's doubting it amen
[54:31] you better just
[54:32] keep you played a plan on keep proving
[54:34] because one evidence won't be enough
[54:40] amen and if you try to prove to yourself
[54:44] amen
[54:44] prove to yourself by whatever action by
[54:47] whatever
[54:48] event whatever it is that you try to say
[54:50] now you know that i proved it to myself
[54:53] i proved it to those around you
[54:54] you'll begin to doubt yourself
[54:59] there's got to be something that takes
[55:01] away doubts in the hour of temptation
[55:03] when the devil tries to bring down
[55:04] there's got to be an anchor that was set
[55:06] somewhere
[55:08] you go back to and say no god did this
[55:11] for me he
[55:11] called me he sought me and he found
[55:15] me and he gave me his revelation and he
[55:18] gave me
[55:20] he gave me his love he gave me the
[55:23] assurance that i'm his
[55:26] amen if we start trying to pin it down
[55:28] on throwing ourselves down from a
[55:30] pinnacle
[55:32] you're gonna have to go back next week
[55:34] and throw yourself off the pinnacle
[55:36] and the week after that and the week
[55:38] after that
[55:39] and the week after that
[55:43] these are the temptations that we still
[55:45] face friends
[55:46] but this bride will overcome by the
[55:50] word job got into a situation where his
[55:55] his righteousness was being questioned
[55:59] job got into the situation where his his
[56:02] friends were now questioning
[56:03] his righteousness they were now asking
[56:05] him you know
[56:07] obviously if all this bad stuff's
[56:09] happening in your life you must have
[56:10] done something wrong
[56:12] and job look at job job was a real
[56:14] believer friends
[56:15] because job never said well i've given
[56:18] so much to the poor
[56:19] and i went to church and i i did all
[56:21] that job was looking at the
[56:23] manifestation for his
[56:24] hour the dispensation he was in and the
[56:27] dispensation he was in was under a
[56:29] substitutionary
[56:30] shed blood of a lamb and he was
[56:33] looking at the lamb he had sacrificed
[56:36] according to the word of god
[56:37] and so he was declaring his
[56:38] righteousness by the word for his day
[56:42] he was not declaring his righteousness
[56:44] by his deeds
[56:45] he was declaring his righteousness by
[56:47] his ob his faith in the word and his
[56:49] obedience to that word and he said i
[56:52] have believed amen god when his children
[56:55] had fallen he offered this sacrifice and
[56:58] we were still under that dispensation
[57:00] and he was doing
[57:01] what god had demonstrated he was acting
[57:03] out the word of god he had faith in the
[57:05] word for his day
[57:07] and when he looked at his righteousness
[57:08] he was looking at a bleeding lamb he
[57:10] wasn't looking at his own deeds and so
[57:12] now when everything falls apart in his
[57:14] life and his friends come to him to
[57:15] accuse him of being a secret sinner
[57:17] having something wrong in his life he
[57:19] doesn't go and comb back through and and
[57:22] prove to them
[57:23] and analyze you know events and conduct
[57:26] and order
[57:26] he goes back to the word and says i've
[57:28] offered the sacrifice
[57:31] i'm covered amen there's an atonement a
[57:34] price has been paid for me
[57:35] there's a blood that's covering from my
[57:37] sin i have righteousness because i took
[57:39] him out of his word
[57:42] amen and listen things happen in the
[57:44] life of believers
[57:48] you believe that tragedies strike
[57:51] things happen difficult circumstances
[57:54] come
[57:55] and then the devil will come right on
[57:56] top of that and if the devil can't get
[57:58] to himself
[57:59] he'll send one of his cronies along
[58:06] and says but didn't you do this wrong
[58:07] and didn't you do that or shouldn't you
[58:09] have done this and what about this
[58:12] and i would do like job did i'd say
[58:16] i believe in the cross of calvary
[58:19] i've confessed my sins i've stood upon
[58:22] that word
[58:23] i believe in the righteousness and the
[58:24] life of the blood is here upon me now
[58:26] i'm clean but you did this wrong yes but
[58:30] it's under the blood
[58:31] i'm clean i've been washed by the water
[58:33] of the word
[58:34] i'm staying with the word and my
[58:36] dispensation i have believed god and
[58:38] i've took him out his word and because i
[58:40] believed god and took him at his word he
[58:42] is imputed unto me righteousness not
[58:43] because i deserved it not because i
[58:45] earned it not because i worked my way up
[58:47] to it not because i woke up every day
[58:49] and decided to do right
[58:50] i did it because he put inside of me
[58:52] something to believe him when i see him
[58:54] and i believe him and i acted upon his
[58:56] word and that is my righteousness that
[58:59] is my cleansing i'm free from sin
[59:03] amen not because i acted right for a
[59:05] while i'm free for sin because i took
[59:06] him at his word and he
[59:08] he slayed the lamb of his son and that
[59:10] blood was the price of my redemption and
[59:12] he sent back that spirit upon me and
[59:14] he's washed me by the water of the word
[59:16] and i have received him in his fullness
[59:21] so why did this tragedy hit i don't know
[59:24] why it hit
[59:26] why is this falling apart why is that
[59:28] falling apart and
[59:29] i don't know why any of it's happening
[59:32] but one thing i know is i'm his and i've
[59:35] believed him and he's made a promise to
[59:37] me
[59:38] that's what job could stand upon
[59:42] in the smyrnan church age from the
[59:45] church age book
[59:48] brother bam says now the lord god
[59:50] almighty says i know
[59:52] there he is walking in the midst of his
[59:55] people there he is the chief shepherd of
[59:57] the flock
[59:57] but does he hold back the persecution
[1:00:00] does he stem the tribulation no he does
[1:00:02] not
[1:00:02] he simply says i know your tribulation i
[1:00:05] know
[1:00:06] i am not at all unmindful of your
[1:00:08] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[1:00:10] to so many people
[1:00:11] like israel they wonder if god really
[1:00:14] loves them how can god be just and
[1:00:16] loving
[1:00:16] if he stands by and watches his people
[1:00:18] suffer
[1:00:21] that is what they asked in malachi 1
[1:00:24] verse 1
[1:00:24] the burden of the word of the lord to
[1:00:26] israel by malachi i have loved you saith
[1:00:28] the lord yet
[1:00:29] we see yet we say wherein hast thou
[1:00:31] loved us
[1:00:32] was not esau jacob's brother saith the
[1:00:34] lord yet i love jacob and i hated esau
[1:00:37] and laid his mountains in his heritage
[1:00:39] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[1:00:41] you see they could not figure out god's
[1:00:43] love they thought
[1:00:45] that love meant no suffering
[1:00:49] you're hungry make those stones in the
[1:00:51] bread
[1:00:53] and jesus could say my father didn't
[1:00:55] tell me to make those stones in the
[1:00:56] bread
[1:01:01] but you're hungry does your father want
[1:01:03] you to be hungry
[1:01:05] what a tricky question
[1:01:08] is he not a good father does he not give
[1:01:10] good gifts to those who ask
[1:01:12] yes he gives good gifts but his
[1:01:13] definition of good and mine aren't
[1:01:14] always the same
[1:01:18] today hunger might be good
[1:01:22] you realize the moment that the devil
[1:01:24] starts getting you to doubt your sonship
[1:01:28] he can get you to do all kinds of things
[1:01:31] he can get you to look at things
[1:01:33] differently accept things you wouldn't
[1:01:35] accept
[1:01:36] take actions you wouldn't have taken
[1:01:38] move amen
[1:01:39] in places that you don't feel
[1:01:40] comfortable moving why he's
[1:01:42] automatically got you to doubt your
[1:01:43] sonship
[1:01:44] and now he's pulled a bait and switch
[1:01:46] he's taken away the security god's given
[1:01:48] to you
[1:01:48] and he's offering security through an
[1:01:50] action a conduct or an evidence
[1:01:54] but he's taken away the security of
[1:01:56] divine revealed word of revelation by
[1:01:59] god of his word he's taken away that
[1:02:01] security
[1:02:02] and he's offered a false security
[1:02:07] if you do this and if you do that and if
[1:02:10] this changes in your life
[1:02:13] then you'll be a son of god
[1:02:18] and tell you once you start chasing that
[1:02:19] carrot on the stick you're going to get
[1:02:21] tired
[1:02:23] because you never get to the carrot
[1:02:28] it's a temptation of the devil i'd say
[1:02:31] get thee behind me satan
[1:02:34] my god has called me from before the
[1:02:37] foundation of the world
[1:02:38] and he put no requirement on me other
[1:02:40] than faith
[1:02:42] and that not on myself it was a gift
[1:02:44] from him
[1:02:47] why now do you put requirements on me
[1:02:50] it's not my life i live anyway is it the
[1:02:52] life he lives through me if i could just
[1:02:54] get myself out of the way then he can do
[1:02:56] the works
[1:02:57] it's not my works it's his works
[1:03:00] my works are filthy rags his works are
[1:03:02] perfect
[1:03:04] the devil's trying to get you to take
[1:03:06] your own works which are filthy rags
[1:03:09] for the evidence of righteousness
[1:03:12] instead of taking his righteousness
[1:03:15] which is faith
[1:03:16] that is by him and then letting him do
[1:03:19] his works through you
[1:03:20] which are perfect you see how close it
[1:03:23] is
[1:03:24] it can be so deceptive that's why the
[1:03:27] hour that we're in requires spiritual
[1:03:29] discernment by
[1:03:30] the word and say no i'm not taking your
[1:03:33] bait devil get behind me
[1:03:34] i only do that which the father shows me
[1:03:39] that's where jesus was remember
[1:03:42] brother branham he was in a meeting and
[1:03:44] there was some reporters
[1:03:45] reporting evil about their meetings and
[1:03:47] and one of his campaign managers started
[1:03:49] ranting and says
[1:03:50] what we need is an elijah amen to go out
[1:03:53] on mark
[1:03:54] we need a mount carmel showdown we need
[1:03:56] an elijah to go out there
[1:03:58] and show him what for and have a real
[1:03:59] showdown
[1:04:01] and he was pointing his finger at
[1:04:02] brother brandon what he was doing is
[1:04:04] accusing brother branham of not being
[1:04:05] bold enough
[1:04:07] because he knew brother benham he knew
[1:04:09] who he was he knew he was elijah
[1:04:11] ministry he knew
[1:04:12] the gift that he had he knew he was a
[1:04:13] prophet of god and he knew and then he
[1:04:15] watched over and over what was
[1:04:16] he was able to do on the platform and he
[1:04:20] started
[1:04:20] put he was actually putting pressure on
[1:04:22] brother brown and say what we
[1:04:23] need is an elijah amen that can go out
[1:04:25] there and what's he doing
[1:04:27] he's using the scriptures
[1:04:31] and brother branham's office
[1:04:36] he's actually taking he there's the
[1:04:39] elijah of the
[1:04:40] day he's taking scripture out of the
[1:04:42] bible and
[1:04:43] he's painting a picture here we are amen
[1:04:46] all these false preachers amen
[1:04:48] now they're all falsely uh disclaiming
[1:04:50] this and saying this and speaking out
[1:04:52] against the true god
[1:04:53] amen what we need is an elijah to go
[1:04:56] down there we need a mount carmel
[1:04:57] showdown we need somebody we'll take
[1:04:59] and prove who god is boy that's bait
[1:05:02] ain't it
[1:05:04] what if you were sitting there that day
[1:05:06] and you knew who you were and you knew
[1:05:07] why you were scripture and you knew what
[1:05:08] you were called to do
[1:05:09] and he says something like that
[1:05:12] but brother brahm says now see brother
[1:05:15] he said
[1:05:16] elijah said lord i've done all this at
[1:05:19] thy
[1:05:20] bidding he didn't do it on her own he
[1:05:24] did it because the lord told him to do
[1:05:26] it and brother branham could
[1:05:28] he was elijah absolutely amen was there
[1:05:30] going to come a mount carmel showdown
[1:05:32] yes in the word amen
[1:05:33] but he was not going to get ahead of god
[1:05:35] and take his own idea
[1:05:37] and what somebody else would what the
[1:05:38] devil was speaking through another mouth
[1:05:40] that was a friend of his
[1:05:44] don't think that can't happen because
[1:05:45] jesus turned around and to peter and
[1:05:47] said satan get thee behind me
[1:05:53] his friend amen was the devil was using
[1:05:56] the emotions of a friend and the wrong
[1:05:58] understanding of a friend
[1:06:00] amen and actually his friend was angry
[1:06:05] he wasn't interested in what god wanted
[1:06:06] he was mad because of what they said in
[1:06:08] the newspaper
[1:06:10] and he was reacting out of his own
[1:06:11] emotion and the devil was using that
[1:06:13] to bring an influence to the prophet of
[1:06:15] god but the prophet of god knew the word
[1:06:17] and he went right back to the word
[1:06:19] and he said elijah did that at god's
[1:06:22] bidding
[1:06:25] brother branham wasn't going to move
[1:06:26] unless god told him to
[1:06:29] he didn't take that bait and i'm
[1:06:30] thankful
[1:06:34] see i'm coming back to this quote in
[1:06:36] submergent church age
[1:06:40] you see they could not figure out god's
[1:06:41] love they thought that love meant no
[1:06:43] suffering they thought that love meant a
[1:06:45] baby with parental care
[1:06:46] but god said that his love was elective
[1:06:48] love the proof of it proof of his love
[1:06:50] is election
[1:06:51] that no matter what happened his love
[1:06:53] was proved truly
[1:06:54] by the fact they were chosen unto
[1:06:57] salvation
[1:06:58] because god has chosen you to salvation
[1:07:00] through sanctification the spirit and
[1:07:02] belief
[1:07:02] of the truth he may commit you to death
[1:07:05] as he did paul
[1:07:06] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:07:08] job what is his
[1:07:10] that is his prerogative he is sovereign
[1:07:13] but it is
[1:07:13] all with a purpose if he did not have a
[1:07:16] purpose then he would be the author of
[1:07:17] frustration and not of peace
[1:07:19] his purpose is that after we have
[1:07:21] suffered a while we should be made
[1:07:22] perfect be established strengthened and
[1:07:24] settled
[1:07:25] as job said he put strength in us you
[1:07:28] see
[1:07:28] he himself suffered he learned obedience
[1:07:30] by the things that he suffered
[1:07:32] he was actually made perfect by the
[1:07:34] things
[1:07:35] that he suffered you see
[1:07:42] when the devil comes to you when you're
[1:07:45] suffering
[1:07:46] it says if you be if you're the bride of
[1:07:48] jesus christ why are you suffering like
[1:07:54] this
[1:07:56] i just recently we've been reading
[1:07:58] through the book of acts just for my own
[1:07:59] personal study i i
[1:08:00] take sometimes subjects just for me that
[1:08:02] i'm enjoying and i was
[1:08:04] studying through the book of acts and i
[1:08:06] began to marvel
[1:08:08] at the supernatural power and
[1:08:10] deliverance manifest in the apostle paul
[1:08:14] but what made me marvel is just as much
[1:08:17] as i saw
[1:08:18] supernatural deliverance and healing i
[1:08:21] saw paul suffering
[1:08:23] just as much the same god who would tell
[1:08:26] paul
[1:08:27] don't fear but speak boldly in this city
[1:08:29] for i have much people and they'll not
[1:08:31] harm you
[1:08:32] is the same one that would lead them to
[1:08:34] another city let him preach and be
[1:08:36] carried outside the city and stoned
[1:08:39] he can deliver him in one city and not
[1:08:41] in another
[1:08:43] in one they'll release him when they the
[1:08:45] the the you know the chief captains or
[1:08:47] the elders or whoever it is in the
[1:08:48] council will come to the city and
[1:08:49] they'll intervene on paul's behalf and
[1:08:51] they'll let they'll let the disciples go
[1:08:53] and then in another city god won't
[1:08:55] intervene at all nobody will intervene
[1:08:56] and they'll take them and beat them and
[1:08:57] put them in prison
[1:09:02] why does he do it one time and not
[1:09:04] another
[1:09:06] the apostle paul i mean he comes to a
[1:09:09] blind man
[1:09:10] opens his eyes lame man amen and the
[1:09:13] lame man walks oh somebody who fell
[1:09:15] out of the window is dead he lays his
[1:09:16] body across and he comes back to life
[1:09:19] but the scripture said he left his buddy
[1:09:21] in a city sick
[1:09:27] paul says timotheus went here and
[1:09:30] or somebody harassed us and timotheus i
[1:09:32] left in
[1:09:33] militum or something like that
[1:09:37] i left him and milled him sick
[1:09:41] paul don't you believe in divine healing
[1:09:47] don't you believe in laying on a hand
[1:09:49] why did you leave him in that city sick
[1:09:53] and paul wasn't ashamed to admit it he
[1:09:56] wrote in his letter
[1:09:58] i left so and so and milled him sick
[1:10:02] left him behind so he could recover
[1:10:08] you see god's ways are not like our ways
[1:10:10] god knows what he's doing
[1:10:14] and that's why when the devil comes with
[1:10:16] this temptation if thou be bride of
[1:10:18] jesus christ why are you saying if thou
[1:10:20] be
[1:10:20] cast yourself down from this pinnacle if
[1:10:23] thou be
[1:10:24] claim this if thou be amen just go do
[1:10:26] that
[1:10:27] if thou be
[1:10:31] i'd look at him say i am who i
[1:10:34] am by the grace of god
[1:10:39] he called me he who separated me from my
[1:10:41] mother's womb
[1:10:43] and called me by his grace
[1:10:46] he's the one i'm depending on
[1:10:50] the devil will try to push us and
[1:10:52] persuade us and take actions and
[1:10:54] do things amen based off circumstances
[1:10:57] what other
[1:10:58] people are thinking what other people
[1:10:59] are saying amen but if we take away
[1:11:02] the identity crisis if we just settle
[1:11:04] the fact that i am who i am by the grace
[1:11:07] of god
[1:11:07] that i am a son of god i am a daughter
[1:11:10] of god by a divine revelation
[1:11:12] a personal revelation from god i know
[1:11:14] who i am and if i'm that then i know
[1:11:16] that my position has been secure
[1:11:18] is secure will always be secure
[1:11:22] you'd be surprised how much power that
[1:11:25] takes away from the devil
[1:11:28] he's always trying to bring an identity
[1:11:30] crisis
[1:11:32] and i would resist that devil if i were
[1:11:34] you i would recognize him
[1:11:38] jesus when the lord comes to move us
[1:11:42] the lord doesn't come to us at least not
[1:11:44] i've ever seen in the bible
[1:11:46] he doesn't come to us and said if you
[1:11:48] were my son you would
[1:11:54] did you ever read that in the bible
[1:11:58] if you were my son you would if you were
[1:12:00] my daughter you would
[1:12:04] so when they start off when the thoughts
[1:12:06] start off if you were if you were bride
[1:12:08] why is this happening with your bride
[1:12:09] i would say i'm bribed by his choice
[1:12:13] he knows the way that i take my
[1:12:15] footsteps are ordered at him
[1:12:16] amen if he's determined that i'm going
[1:12:19] to be stoned today
[1:12:20] then i'm going to be stoned today if
[1:12:22] he's determined i'm going to be in
[1:12:23] prison today
[1:12:24] i'll be in prison if he's determined
[1:12:26] that these hands shall be laid on the
[1:12:27] sick and they shall recover
[1:12:29] they will recover amen it's for his
[1:12:31] purpose not for my gratification
[1:12:36] we have to realize we we you know we get
[1:12:38] things topsy-turvy but
[1:12:40] god has a plan and god has a purpose and
[1:12:42] he called paul
[1:12:43] when he called paul amen he told him i
[1:12:45] tell him these
[1:12:46] great things that he must suffer for my
[1:12:48] name's sake so when god
[1:12:50] started paul off he started paul off in
[1:12:53] the truth
[1:12:54] he said he's a chosen vessel for my
[1:12:56] purpose
[1:12:59] but i'll show him what great things he
[1:13:00] must suffer for my name say
[1:13:02] so when paul gets the message when god
[1:13:04] calls paul the saul at this time
[1:13:06] when god calls him he calls him saying
[1:13:09] you're called you're a specific you're
[1:13:11] called for
[1:13:11] you're chosen for a specific purpose
[1:13:14] and you're going to suffer
[1:13:18] paul knew exactly what he was getting
[1:13:19] into when he was being stoned it wasn't
[1:13:21] like what's happened i thought i was
[1:13:26] the stoning didn't change god's purpose
[1:13:29] the stoning was part of god's purpose
[1:13:33] imagine disciples who god would
[1:13:35] supernaturally the apostles
[1:13:36] supernaturally delivered delivered
[1:13:38] delivered delivered deliver
[1:13:40] there came a time when he didn't deliver
[1:13:42] them
[1:13:44] he delivered paul but there came a time
[1:13:45] paul was beheaded
[1:13:47] he delivered peter supernaturally amen
[1:13:50] an angel
[1:13:51] entered into the inner chamber of the
[1:13:52] prison and the angel woke him up
[1:13:54] and opened the doors and walked him
[1:13:56] right out of the prison amen so that
[1:13:58] peter's life would not be destroyed and
[1:14:00] peter's life would not be threatened
[1:14:01] because god had a purpose for peter
[1:14:05] but when god's purpose was done peter
[1:14:07] was hung upside down on the cross
[1:14:12] was he a son of god why didn't god
[1:14:14] deliver him
[1:14:16] because it was god's purpose friends and
[1:14:18] you and i are here to serve
[1:14:20] god's purpose amen not our own purpose
[1:14:23] his purpose
[1:14:24] and his purpose he has a plan and in
[1:14:26] that plan there's certain things that
[1:14:27] have to happen in our life
[1:14:29] for him to get glory for him to display
[1:14:31] his word for him to overcome his enemy
[1:14:33] through us
[1:14:33] and god allows certain things to happen
[1:14:36] and we cannot go into hysteria
[1:14:38] every time something happens and begin
[1:14:40] to doubt our sonship and try to prove
[1:14:41] who we
[1:14:42] are but we need to come back to our
[1:14:43] calling amen make sure your calling and
[1:14:46] election is sure
[1:14:48] because things will happen in life
[1:14:50] disruptions and heartache and difficulty
[1:14:52] amen it does not mean you're wrong or
[1:14:55] out of the will of god
[1:14:56] it might mean you're exactly stepping
[1:14:58] step and step in the will of god
[1:15:00] for the fosters of the righteous are
[1:15:02] ordered to the lord
[1:15:06] but the devil tries to mess with our
[1:15:08] identity
[1:15:10] and when he tries to mess with our
[1:15:12] identity he tries to get us to take
[1:15:13] action
[1:15:15] without the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:15:18] i don't know about you but that's always
[1:15:20] been bad for me
[1:15:30] praise the lord
[1:15:36] i think it's interesting to note that
[1:15:40] just a little while after paul left his
[1:15:43] buddy sick
[1:15:45] at moledum it wasn't too much longer
[1:15:48] after that that he was captured in
[1:15:50] jerusalem and
[1:15:52] he was taken on a ship and the ship got
[1:15:55] caught in the storm
[1:15:56] and there was a shipwreck and he was
[1:15:59] spilled out on an island
[1:16:04] he's picking up sticks and he threw the
[1:16:05] sticks in the fire and out of the fire
[1:16:07] come a viper and latched on his hand
[1:16:10] and he shook it off in the fire
[1:16:14] and the venom never bothered him and
[1:16:17] this was a man who had a thorn in his
[1:16:19] flesh
[1:16:20] a sickness that god wouldn't deliver him
[1:16:22] from that he bore around
[1:16:24] daily an infirmity a weakness that he
[1:16:28] carried
[1:16:29] brother branham said it seemed like it
[1:16:30] was his eyes
[1:16:32] couldn't write his own letters and you
[1:16:35] would think why wouldn't god heal his
[1:16:36] eyes
[1:16:37] amen he's the prophet why wouldn't god
[1:16:39] heal him so he could write his own
[1:16:40] letters
[1:16:41] would have that been more effective
[1:16:44] paul just could keep writing he doesn't
[1:16:45] need a scribe
[1:16:48] but god said unless that will be exalted
[1:16:50] above measure
[1:16:51] he allowed a messenger of satan to buff
[1:16:54] it
[1:16:54] and here's a man who has an affliction
[1:16:56] in one part of his body
[1:16:59] get bit by a venomous snake and the
[1:17:00] other part of his body and shake it off
[1:17:04] because the affliction was serving a
[1:17:05] purpose and the supernatural healing was
[1:17:08] serving a purpose at the same time
[1:17:11] the apostle paul's affliction in his
[1:17:12] body was keeping him from being overly
[1:17:14] exalted
[1:17:15] but when he flipped that serpent into
[1:17:17] the fire all the heathen round about
[1:17:19] were taking note and says
[1:17:20] surely this is a wicked man though he
[1:17:22] survived amen the gods are going to slay
[1:17:24] him
[1:17:27] and when he didn't get sick when it
[1:17:28] didn't swell when nothing happened
[1:17:30] they changed their mind and they didn't
[1:17:33] think anymore the gods were punishing
[1:17:35] they thought he was a god
[1:17:38] and god used that to evangelize that
[1:17:41] island amen
[1:17:42] and then paul went over the same paul
[1:17:44] who left his buddy sick before the
[1:17:46] journey
[1:17:47] the same paul went over to the
[1:17:48] governor's house whose father was laying
[1:17:50] ill
[1:17:51] laid hands on him and he recovered and
[1:17:53] then they brought from far all that were
[1:17:55] sick that came to paul to be healed
[1:17:58] why why do these things happen i'd say
[1:18:01] quit
[1:18:01] asking why amen and just trust god with
[1:18:04] your life when you've surrendered your
[1:18:05] life to him let him do with it what he
[1:18:07] wants though it's high though it's low
[1:18:09] though it's comfortable
[1:18:10] uncomfortable quit doubting who you are
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:13] we've got that's that issue has been
[1:18:15] settled we know what day we're in we
[1:18:17] know what age we're in we know what
[1:18:18] dispensation we're under
[1:18:20] and who has given us the ability to
[1:18:22] believe that and obey that it was him
[1:18:25] by faith
[1:18:29] amen long as the devil can get us to
[1:18:32] doubt who we are in question our sonship
[1:18:34] he can move us over here
[1:18:36] and move us over here and play games
[1:18:39] with us
[1:18:41] but that's not what god wants out of his
[1:18:43] bride he wants a bride that he has
[1:18:44] preeminence over not the devil
[1:18:48] one that he's in control of one that's
[1:18:50] moving by his word by his leadership and
[1:18:53] he's leading them in the word
[1:18:55] and one they'll go step by step by his
[1:18:57] spiritual leadership
[1:18:58] amen not be tossed here and tossed there
[1:19:01] amen because the devil said if you're a
[1:19:03] bride you're this and if you're a bride
[1:19:04] he wouldn't that
[1:19:05] and if you're a bride this wouldn't
[1:19:06] happen to you
[1:19:08] god doesn't need a bride who's always
[1:19:10] wondering if she's a bride or not he
[1:19:11] needs a bride
[1:19:12] who will take him at his word believe
[1:19:14] what he's told her
[1:19:16] and stand in confidence like the apostle
[1:19:19] paul apostle paul
[1:19:20] listen some historians believe that the
[1:19:23] apostle paul
[1:19:24] amen could not even walk standing erect
[1:19:27] anymore
[1:19:28] because of the severe beatings that he
[1:19:29] had on multiple occasions
[1:19:32] that he had the scars in his body
[1:19:36] of the beatings that he had stonings
[1:19:40] that he took
[1:19:41] outside the city and they left him for
[1:19:42] dead imprisonments and chains
[1:19:45] and the harshness and of the of travel
[1:19:48] on the roads in those days listen
[1:19:49] he wasn't getting in a train with air
[1:19:52] conditioning and plush seats
[1:19:55] going from city to city traveling from
[1:19:57] place to place
[1:19:58] in perils by the seas and perils in his
[1:20:00] countrymen and perils
[1:20:02] on the roads he had a difficult life
[1:20:06] amen and then after all of it they would
[1:20:08] begin to question his apostleship
[1:20:10] and letters and they would begin to ask
[1:20:12] him for proof of his apostleship
[1:20:16] the devil's trying to tempt him into
[1:20:18] proven and he says are not ye
[1:20:20] proof of my apostleship the fact that
[1:20:22] you're a church and you believe the
[1:20:24] gospel amen
[1:20:25] are you are you evidence of my
[1:20:26] apostleship
[1:20:28] i don't have anything to prove god
[1:20:31] proved it
[1:20:34] he was trying to get lured into those
[1:20:36] things
[1:20:37] but he didn't take debate
[1:20:41] praise god
[1:20:45] let's go back to matthew chapter 4.
[1:20:51] i pray that god is opening your heart
[1:20:59] this is the hour to overcome these
[1:21:00] things friends
[1:21:02] this is the hour for the bride to know
[1:21:05] who she is
[1:21:06] to have a proper identification in him
[1:21:08] and to stand
[1:21:09] fast in the word that god has given us
[1:21:12] this day
[1:21:16] matthew chapter 4 i'd like to pick up
[1:21:19] verse 8.
[1:21:23] and the devil taketh him up into an
[1:21:24] exceeding high mountain
[1:21:26] and showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[1:21:28] world and the glory of them
[1:21:31] and saith unto him all these things will
[1:21:33] i give thee
[1:21:34] if thou will falt down and worship me
[1:21:37] then saith jesus unto him get thee hence
[1:21:39] satan
[1:21:40] for it is written thou shalt worship the
[1:21:42] lord thy god
[1:21:43] and him only shalt thou serve then the
[1:21:46] devil leaveth him
[1:21:47] and behold angels come and ministered
[1:21:49] unto him
[1:21:52] in another passage of scriptures over i
[1:21:54] believe in luke
[1:21:55] it says and the devil departed from him
[1:21:57] for a season
[1:22:00] that wasn't the last of his tempting
[1:22:06] he says the devil now is trying
[1:22:10] to give the give the lord all the
[1:22:12] kingdoms of the earth
[1:22:14] it's a shortcut
[1:22:17] he knows that he was born the son of
[1:22:19] david that the kingdom will fall into
[1:22:20] his hands that he'll sit on the throne
[1:22:22] and but now he's trying to bring him to
[1:22:24] the throne but he's trying to bring him
[1:22:26] to the throne
[1:22:27] out of time and with no personal
[1:22:30] sacrifice
[1:22:33] out of god's time and with no sacrifice
[1:22:37] and without his brethren
[1:22:40] because if there's no price of
[1:22:41] redemption he'll become god over the
[1:22:43] earth
[1:22:44] but he won't have the seed that will
[1:22:47] only come when the price of redemption
[1:22:49] is paid
[1:22:50] he's trying to get him to bypass god's
[1:22:52] plan for his own personal glory
[1:22:54] and his own kingdom but he would have to
[1:22:56] have a kingdom without you and i
[1:22:58] yeah and he would have to have a kingdom
[1:23:02] without sacrifice
[1:23:03] without paying the price
[1:23:06] amen and that's not what he was
[1:23:08] interested in
[1:23:10] brother branham said things that are to
[1:23:11] be said jesus was taken by satan up and
[1:23:13] showed him
[1:23:14] all the kingdoms of the world that was
[1:23:16] would be what more
[1:23:17] and satan climbed them climbed them his
[1:23:20] and
[1:23:21] jesus never argued with him because he
[1:23:23] is the god of this world see
[1:23:24] and he said i'll give them to you if
[1:23:26] you'll fall down and worship me see
[1:23:28] he was trying to give them over to jesus
[1:23:30] without sacrifice see
[1:23:32] it was a bargain that he was going to
[1:23:33] make him
[1:23:37] and jesus wouldn't stand for it
[1:23:41] he said get behind me
[1:23:45] listen this is this is so
[1:23:49] often a temptation
[1:23:54] that we want the blessings of god
[1:23:57] without the sacrifice
[1:24:00] we want the position of bride
[1:24:04] without death
[1:24:07] but there's no position of bride without
[1:24:09] death
[1:24:12] you have to come low before you go high
[1:24:15] you must be a base you must become the
[1:24:17] sacrifice you must give your life
[1:24:19] willingly
[1:24:19] you must die if you ever hope to be
[1:24:22] exalted in the position of bride
[1:24:23] but so many times the devil's trying to
[1:24:26] tempt us say man
[1:24:26] to call ourselves to move ourselves into
[1:24:29] to move into something
[1:24:30] amen without first dying
[1:24:33] and we have to first die to self in
[1:24:36] order to be exalted to the position of
[1:24:38] bride
[1:24:38] and jesus was going to have to die to
[1:24:41] himself he was going to have to give
[1:24:42] himself as a sacrifice
[1:24:44] before he would ever inherit the kingdom
[1:24:47] because jesus just didn't want a
[1:24:48] position he wanted to fulfill the
[1:24:50] father's will
[1:24:51] and he didn't want a kingdom without you
[1:24:53] and i
[1:24:54] so he was willing to pay the price
[1:24:58] amen let's turn to matthew 16. i
[1:25:00] referred to this but i'd like to read it
[1:25:03] matthew 16.
[1:25:10] matthew 16 and verse 21.
[1:25:13] in matthew 16 you have that uh great
[1:25:16] question that jesus asked who do men say
[1:25:18] that i am
[1:25:19] peter gave the answer thou art christ
[1:25:20] the son of the living god
[1:25:22] he said blessed are thou simon barjona
[1:25:24] for flesh and blood never revealed this
[1:25:25] to you but my father which
[1:25:27] art in heaven has to reveal this to you
[1:25:30] and so then coming down further from
[1:25:32] there in verse 21 he said
[1:25:34] from that time forth began jesus to show
[1:25:37] unto his disciples
[1:25:38] how that he must go into jerusalem and
[1:25:40] suffer many things of the elders and
[1:25:42] chief priests and scribes
[1:25:43] and be killed and be raised again the
[1:25:46] third day
[1:25:47] then peter took him and began to rebuke
[1:25:49] him saying be it far from thee lord this
[1:25:51] shall not be unto thee but he turned and
[1:25:55] said
[1:25:56] unto peter get thee behind me satan thou
[1:25:59] art an offense unto me
[1:26:00] for thou savers not the things that be
[1:26:02] of god
[1:26:03] but those that be of men
[1:26:07] now peter
[1:26:12] peter doesn't want the lord
[1:26:15] to be arrested and be crucified
[1:26:20] peter doesn't want the lord and you have
[1:26:23] to ask yourself why is peter
[1:26:26] taking the lord and rebuking him and you
[1:26:28] know jesus
[1:26:29] now is the word made manifest jesus was
[1:26:31] their master and lord
[1:26:33] and they just got the revelation that he
[1:26:35] was christ the son of the living god and
[1:26:36] that revelation had come from the father
[1:26:38] and we've got all of these things that
[1:26:41] have just happened and
[1:26:42] they knew who he was but now he begins
[1:26:44] to tell them what's going to happen
[1:26:46] and everything he told them happened
[1:26:49] they had trusted him they had left their
[1:26:51] fishing nets they had left everything
[1:26:53] to join themselves to christ and now
[1:26:54] christ tells them what's going to happen
[1:26:56] but what he tells them is not what they
[1:26:58] want to hear
[1:27:01] and when he tells them something they
[1:27:03] don't want to hear peter
[1:27:04] takes the lord and the language here is
[1:27:07] so interesting just listen
[1:27:11] he says peter took him where did he take
[1:27:14] him
[1:27:16] that's an interesting phrase and peter
[1:27:18] took him
[1:27:19] it began to rebuke him saying be it far
[1:27:21] from thee lord this shall not be unto
[1:27:23] thee
[1:27:24] the way he's explaining this you get the
[1:27:26] imagery that he's like
[1:27:32] come here don't say that
[1:27:37] and let's look over at mark and the
[1:27:38] reason i believe this is over at mark 8
[1:27:40] hold your place here but turn to mark
[1:27:42] chapter 8.
[1:27:47] mark chapter 8
[1:27:51] and verse 31
[1:27:57] mark 8 and 31 this is the same
[1:27:58] conversation and he began to teach them
[1:28:00] that the son of man must suffer many
[1:28:01] things and be rejected of the elders and
[1:28:03] of the chief priests and scribes and be
[1:28:05] killed
[1:28:05] and after three days rise again and he
[1:28:08] spake that saying
[1:28:10] openly jesus
[1:28:13] spake that saying openly like he was
[1:28:16] telling everybody
[1:28:20] and peter took him and began to rebuke
[1:28:22] him
[1:28:23] and when he turned about and looked on
[1:28:24] the disciple he rebuked peter saying get
[1:28:26] thee behind me satan
[1:28:27] for thou savers not the things that be
[1:28:29] of god but the things that be of man
[1:28:31] and so now you see there
[1:28:35] they're here and and it says he spake
[1:28:38] openly
[1:28:39] but peter took him and rebuked him this
[1:28:41] is interesting
[1:28:43] because it to me now i could be a
[1:28:45] million miles from right this is just
[1:28:46] brother chad
[1:28:47] but it's almost as if peter didn't want
[1:28:50] everybody else to hear that
[1:28:53] peter took him and begin to rebuke him
[1:28:56] and say lord be it far from thee that
[1:28:59] this will happen to you
[1:29:00] and almost like peter it almost was like
[1:29:03] peter was caring about jesus
[1:29:05] amen but jesus turned around and rebuked
[1:29:08] him and it was a devil that was speaking
[1:29:10] it was satan that was speaking through
[1:29:12] peter amen he said get thee behind me
[1:29:14] satan
[1:29:15] for thou savers not saviors not the
[1:29:17] things that be of god
[1:29:18] but the things that be of men and then
[1:29:20] all of a sudden you realize
[1:29:22] that peter was worried about peter
[1:29:26] it looked like peter was worried about
[1:29:28] the lord but peter was worried about
[1:29:30] peter
[1:29:31] because peter was one of those who
[1:29:32] believed jesus was going to the throne
[1:29:34] immediately he believed that the kingdom
[1:29:37] was beginning to get set up on the earth
[1:29:39] he believed that he was going to have a
[1:29:40] position and he was among the disciples
[1:29:42] that were arguing on who would be the
[1:29:44] greatest among them
[1:29:46] and he was a zealot amen and he was he
[1:29:49] was
[1:29:50] you know so much believe this amen that
[1:29:52] though jesus told him what would happen
[1:29:54] when when they came to take jesus he
[1:29:56] took out a sword and tried to kill a man
[1:30:00] he cut off his ear i don't think he was
[1:30:02] aiming for his ear
[1:30:07] he's either trying to split a skull or
[1:30:08] cut his head off
[1:30:11] but marcus could weave and zag
[1:30:15] somehow got his ear chopped off peter
[1:30:19] believed that that jesus was coming to
[1:30:22] his position
[1:30:23] now he believed the kingdom was coming
[1:30:26] now he believed that he was rising with
[1:30:28] jesus to power and authority
[1:30:30] now peter did not want
[1:30:33] jesus to suffer he did not want him to
[1:30:36] be evilly mistreated he didn't want and
[1:30:38] no doubt there was
[1:30:38] genuine affection and love between peter
[1:30:41] and the lord but
[1:30:42] but he was also desiring the things that
[1:30:44] be of man
[1:30:45] amen he wanted that position he wanted
[1:30:47] that glory he wanted
[1:30:48] to move into that kingdom he did not
[1:30:51] want to be chased from city to city
[1:30:55] and you know even peter's still hanging
[1:30:57] on to this wrong idea amen
[1:30:59] even in the last supper when jesus says
[1:31:01] you all forsake me he said though all
[1:31:02] men forsake you all not forsake you
[1:31:05] they all said why because he was wanting
[1:31:07] to come into the kingdom
[1:31:09] but immediately amen when jesus is
[1:31:12] arrested and now there's no hope and no
[1:31:14] strength and no ability amen
[1:31:16] immediately he becomes a coward
[1:31:20] and moves into the outer court where the
[1:31:22] trial is
[1:31:24] begins to slip over by a fire trying to
[1:31:26] conceal himself
[1:31:27] and when he's confronted by a damsel
[1:31:30] this is how brave this warrior is
[1:31:33] but he's confronted by a damsel and said
[1:31:36] are you not
[1:31:36] ye of galilee he said i am not
[1:31:39] weren't you with him i am not the third
[1:31:41] time and he began to swear
[1:31:43] why peter was interested in protecting
[1:31:45] peter
[1:31:49] but peter learned
[1:31:53] peter repented peter realized where he
[1:31:56] make a mistake and you don't see peter
[1:31:59] exalting himself after that
[1:32:02] peter began to suffer for the lord be
[1:32:05] imprisoned and be threatened and be
[1:32:06] persecuted
[1:32:09] his lord took the low way and peter took
[1:32:11] the low way
[1:32:13] peter will sit on the throne in fact
[1:32:16] he's on one now
[1:32:19] where the 24 elders are but the way up
[1:32:22] was down and it wasn't the way he
[1:32:23] thought
[1:32:25] peter so got with the program when they
[1:32:28] finally decided to crucify him
[1:32:30] he did not even want to be crucified the
[1:32:32] same way as lord because he was so low
[1:32:34] he wanted to be turned upside down see
[1:32:41] peter had taken the wrong idea
[1:32:44] peter was one of the exaltation he
[1:32:46] wanted he didn't want the suffering
[1:32:49] he didn't want the difficulty he didn't
[1:32:51] want the rejection
[1:32:52] he wanted the kingdom but if you want
[1:32:56] the kingdom
[1:32:57] you're going to have to take the
[1:32:58] rejection and the suffering
[1:33:01] and all the things that go with it
[1:33:05] people want to deny that there'll be any
[1:33:07] kind of suffering at all for the bride
[1:33:08] in the end time
[1:33:10] but brother branham said there'd be a
[1:33:11] squeeze a persecution and tightening up
[1:33:15] i said why would you want to deny that
[1:33:17] if that's what the prophet said
[1:33:19] what's the motivation if that's the way
[1:33:22] the lord chooses
[1:33:23] then that's good enough for me if god
[1:33:28] if god decides you know
[1:33:31] when the apostle paul was arrested it
[1:33:33] was
[1:33:34] after his arrest this is what i find so
[1:33:37] amazing
[1:33:38] it was after his arrest all the
[1:33:40] political leaders heard the gospel
[1:33:45] they now had to deal with paul and find
[1:33:47] out what's the deal
[1:33:48] i mean the church leaders knew what the
[1:33:50] problem was they were all you know there
[1:33:52] was a jewish strife going on in
[1:33:53] the jewish church and this sect and and
[1:33:55] all of a sudden and then it got so bad
[1:33:57] that the
[1:33:57] that the political leaders had to get
[1:33:59] involved and centurion comes down and
[1:34:00] they rescue paul
[1:34:01] and now all of these and from city to
[1:34:04] city to city
[1:34:05] now the religious fight is spilled out
[1:34:08] and now it becomes a political issue and
[1:34:11] now
[1:34:12] uh mayors and governors and magistrates
[1:34:16] have to what have to hear the gospel
[1:34:19] because paul has to explain why they're
[1:34:21] mad well they're mad because i believe
[1:34:23] jesus christ resurrected from the dead
[1:34:25] he was the promise of the fathers blah
[1:34:27] blah blah
[1:34:27] until until felix says you're mad
[1:34:32] don't tell the other king that comes i
[1:34:34] can't remember his name but the other
[1:34:35] king that comes
[1:34:36] he says paul you almost persuaded me to
[1:34:38] be a christian
[1:34:41] what was he doing he was testifying
[1:34:43] where nobody else could get into
[1:34:45] he was standing in halls and declaring
[1:34:47] the gospel where nobody else could
[1:34:48] declare it
[1:34:49] and i say if god wants to repeat that
[1:34:51] then he will
[1:34:53] if god wants it repeated then it will be
[1:34:56] repeated however he chooses i'm not
[1:34:58] going to determine how he does or why he
[1:35:00] does or when he does
[1:35:01] all i'm saying is my life is not mine
[1:35:03] it's his
[1:35:05] and i'm not identified by how good my
[1:35:07] life goes or how much blessings are put
[1:35:09] on me
[1:35:10] i've been identified by this word amen
[1:35:12] when the seals was opened there was my
[1:35:14] identification
[1:35:15] i found out who i was in the bride of
[1:35:17] jesus christ
[1:35:19] it's the word that has identified me now
[1:35:22] if things get better
[1:35:23] i'm still the son of god if things get
[1:35:25] worse i'm still the son of god
[1:35:27] i'm not going to let the devil push me
[1:35:29] here and push me there
[1:35:30] i've been given my identification
[1:35:32] there's been a prophet that come in this
[1:35:34] day
[1:35:35] and under the first seal he said i'm
[1:35:36] going to call you bride
[1:35:39] i'll no longer call you church i'll call
[1:35:41] you bride and my heart
[1:35:42] jumped and that's my title amen
[1:35:47] he may have spoken back in 1963 but he
[1:35:49] was speaking it to me
[1:35:53] what god did what he showed what he
[1:35:56] declared what he opened in the word
[1:35:58] was to give us our identity the headship
[1:36:01] has come down
[1:36:02] and united with the body the two are
[1:36:05] becoming one
[1:36:08] and whatever he chooses to do i'm not
[1:36:11] going to jump here
[1:36:12] jump there and jump there but i'm going
[1:36:14] to stick with this program
[1:36:16] say god you're gone
[1:36:23] let's turn to the book of job
[1:36:39] let's go to job chapter 2.
[1:36:46] brother brahma said in the message it is
[1:36:49] the rising of the sun we just finished
[1:36:50] listening to this
[1:36:52] and this was in this last section we did
[1:36:53] wednesday and it stood out to me
[1:36:55] in a special interest this statement
[1:36:58] i'll read it to you this way it's in a
[1:37:00] prayer and brother branham
[1:37:02] is imploring people to give their heart
[1:37:03] to the lord and he says dear god we're
[1:37:06] only going to be mortal once
[1:37:08] and what will it be if we let this
[1:37:10] opportunity pass us
[1:37:12] our hearts are burning our souls are
[1:37:14] thrilled
[1:37:16] these who have come in and many here are
[1:37:18] hearing this message this morning yes
[1:37:20] two or three hundred lifter lifted their
[1:37:22] hands they want to believe
[1:37:23] lord oh surely that seed is not dead
[1:37:26] lord
[1:37:27] how could they raise their hand like
[1:37:28] that there is something o god
[1:37:30] its old self he's talking about
[1:37:33] something that's hindering
[1:37:34] it's old self it's that wife of job
[1:37:39] standing there saying oh but the lord
[1:37:43] that
[1:37:43] let that let that job that believer walk
[1:37:46] in this morning die completely
[1:37:48] and be buried here in the baptism waters
[1:37:50] that statement struck me
[1:37:52] he said that's that old self the wife of
[1:37:54] job
[1:37:55] so i'm going to go back and look at job
[1:37:57] and his wife for just a minute
[1:37:58] in job chapter 2 verse 7.
[1:38:04] so so went satan forth from the presence
[1:38:06] of the lord and smote job was sore boils
[1:38:08] from the soul of his foot into his crown
[1:38:10] and he took him a posture to scrape
[1:38:12] himself with all and he sat down among
[1:38:14] the ashes
[1:38:16] then said his wife unto him dost thou
[1:38:18] still retain thine integrity
[1:38:20] cursed god and die but he said unto her
[1:38:24] thou
[1:38:24] speakest as one of the foolish women
[1:38:26] speaketh why
[1:38:28] shall we receive good at the hand of god
[1:38:30] and shall we not receive evil
[1:38:33] in all this did not job sin
[1:38:36] with his lips job knew who he was
[1:38:40] his identification wasn't in question
[1:38:42] his righteousness was never in question
[1:38:43] because it was attached to the lamb
[1:38:47] and here his wife comes in and brother
[1:38:49] said this old self the wife of job
[1:38:51] and you look at the wife of job she
[1:38:53] comes down and she looks at the
[1:38:54] circumstances
[1:38:56] she looks at the loss of the children
[1:38:58] and she looks at the loss of all the
[1:39:00] all the donkeys and the camels and the
[1:39:02] all the wealth and all the goods and all
[1:39:04] the prestige and
[1:39:05] and the house and she looks at the loss
[1:39:07] of everything
[1:39:08] and she's carnal and she's looking with
[1:39:10] natural eyes and she's looking all
[1:39:11] around
[1:39:12] and says why do you hold your integrity
[1:39:16] why are you still confessing just curse
[1:39:18] god and die
[1:39:21] he said you speak as one of the foolish
[1:39:23] she didn't say she was a foolish one he
[1:39:24] said you speak as one
[1:39:26] of the foolish women who don't know god
[1:39:29] he said shall we receive good at god's
[1:39:30] hand and not evil
[1:39:33] can god not do both with his children
[1:39:37] can god not allow suffering and bring
[1:39:39] blessings
[1:39:41] is only the blessings from god but when
[1:39:42] he allows the sufferings is it not
[1:39:44] allowed by god was god involved here but
[1:39:48] not involved here
[1:39:50] was god in control over here but he
[1:39:51] wasn't in control over here
[1:39:56] see that old self looks at all the
[1:39:59] conditions and all the suffering and
[1:40:01] doesn't want it
[1:40:03] the wife of job but job was the real
[1:40:06] believer
[1:40:07] he said blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:11] let's look back at chapter 1
[1:40:15] chapter 1 verse 20.
[1:40:19] job 1 and 20. then job arose and rent
[1:40:23] his mantle and shaved his head and fell
[1:40:25] down upon the ground and worshiped
[1:40:27] he said naked came i out of my mother's
[1:40:29] womb and naked shall i return thither
[1:40:31] the lord gave and the lord taketh away
[1:40:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:36] and all this job sinned not nor charged
[1:40:39] god
[1:40:40] foolishly he said lord help me
[1:40:45] in my hour of temptation help me to keep
[1:40:48] my testimony pure
[1:40:50] help me to believe in you and believe
[1:40:52] what you've told me
[1:40:53] and never let my faith waver
[1:40:59] brother rem said and just one more time
[1:41:02] said are you willing to die that's what
[1:41:04] the trouble of it you want to stay alive
[1:41:07] to hollywood the same time be alive with
[1:41:09] god it won't mix
[1:41:10] a seed jesus said except the corner
[1:41:12] wheat fall on the ground and die it
[1:41:13] abides alone
[1:41:14] you'll never bring forth anything oh
[1:41:17] jesus named church what a glorious
[1:41:19] church what a glorious name
[1:41:20] jesus name are you ready to die are you
[1:41:23] assemblies of god general assembly are
[1:41:25] you ready to die
[1:41:25] method is baptist presbyterian are you
[1:41:27] ready to die out to your enemy
[1:41:29] are you willing to pay the price of
[1:41:31] sacrifice really sincerely
[1:41:33] not just come and say well i'll give it
[1:41:34] a try and see how i come out
[1:41:36] you're not ready yet you must be ready
[1:41:38] to pay the price
[1:41:40] and die the devil satan tried to offer
[1:41:44] jesus all the kingdoms of the world
[1:41:46] without death but jesus was willing to
[1:41:48] pay the price
[1:41:50] he tries to come and offer us so many
[1:41:53] ideas and so many thoughts and so many
[1:41:55] positions without death amen but
[1:41:57] we're not going to take it without death
[1:41:59] i'm going to die to myself and let god
[1:42:01] make whatever he wants out of me
[1:42:03] for it's his word i'm not going to take
[1:42:05] the temptation
[1:42:09] amen i'd like to finish up with a story
[1:42:12] from brother bannon if i could just
[1:42:14] read this we've read it many many times
[1:42:16] so we know it so i'll skim through parts
[1:42:17] of it
[1:42:18] but out of the message standing in the
[1:42:20] gap i want to read about one of brother
[1:42:22] branham's temptations
[1:42:24] we saw eaves we saw
[1:42:28] jesus christ in the wilderness i want to
[1:42:30] look at the prophet of god in an hour of
[1:42:32] temptation
[1:42:34] and standing in the gap he said he told
[1:42:36] me that coming down
[1:42:38] after a trip and in my mind i made up my
[1:42:40] mind that i was going to go up to buds
[1:42:43] up in british columbia because he's in
[1:42:45] bad shape up there as a hunter
[1:42:48] before leaving i might drop this in and
[1:42:50] we'll hurry i dreamed a funny dream
[1:42:52] brother branham had been up to up to
[1:42:56] canada and he was actually driving back
[1:42:57] from canada
[1:42:59] and he said i dreamed a funny dream and
[1:43:02] this is before he left
[1:43:03] an odd dream and i hope when my
[1:43:05] brother-in-law gets a hold of this it
[1:43:06] doesn't hurt his feelings and
[1:43:08] i hope it don't hurt my wife who's
[1:43:09] sitting present now but she knows that
[1:43:11] about a month ago right on well it was
[1:43:13] around about october and november i
[1:43:14] dreamed that i was roaming out in the
[1:43:16] dark
[1:43:17] well i had no place to go and nobody
[1:43:18] cared for me and i had become a bum just
[1:43:20] a bum
[1:43:21] and i was cold and i looked in the
[1:43:23] distance and i saw fire and when i got
[1:43:25] over there
[1:43:25] it was a city dump and there had
[1:43:29] ditches and the fire was in the ditches
[1:43:31] and between the ditches was slick where
[1:43:32] bums could sleep
[1:43:34] there to keep warm keep from freezing
[1:43:35] between the fires on a cold winter night
[1:43:38] and i was cold and i walked up to this
[1:43:40] fire to get warm and it was laying full
[1:43:42] of bums
[1:43:43] and there i didn't see any of them but
[1:43:45] they all like had stalls or places where
[1:43:47] their sleeping place was
[1:43:49] and i saw my brother-in-law fletcher
[1:43:51] broy
[1:43:53] going down further he says and when i
[1:43:54] awoke before i woke up fletch said to me
[1:43:57] he said in the dream he said billy i'll
[1:43:59] hunt you a place
[1:44:00] brother bill you fed my children when
[1:44:02] they were hungry he said you was a daddy
[1:44:04] to them
[1:44:04] now i'll find you a place here to keep
[1:44:06] warm
[1:44:08] and we went walking by the bum's place
[1:44:09] and finally come to a place he said
[1:44:11] i'll sit down here i said i'll walk up
[1:44:14] here and see if i can find a place
[1:44:16] i walked up and i looked out in the dark
[1:44:18] cold night and i thought
[1:44:20] think of it one time god almighty let me
[1:44:22] lead his church
[1:44:23] one time he let me preach his gospel and
[1:44:26] see souls saved men and women come from
[1:44:28] around the world to speak with me for a
[1:44:30] few minutes
[1:44:31] and here i am now a bum and nobody wants
[1:44:33] me and i'm cold
[1:44:34] what must i do then i woke up
[1:44:38] i told my wife i said maybe it means
[1:44:39] that fletch is in need so we hurried up
[1:44:41] to see if we could find him
[1:44:42] and his brother found him he was staying
[1:44:44] out where the
[1:44:45] wideners are out there they have trade
[1:44:48] horses and things sleep in a corner of a
[1:44:50] barn or something
[1:44:51] i went on i thought well just have to
[1:44:52] let it go so i came back down from
[1:44:54] canada with fred and them the other day
[1:44:56] and in my mind i had it made up
[1:44:58] if these people didn't want to hear my
[1:45:00] message all right they didn't have to
[1:45:05] do you think this was his hour of
[1:45:06] temptation
[1:45:09] where did that thought come from
[1:45:12] did that come come from the father or
[1:45:14] was this the tempter
[1:45:19] i had preached now for about 35 years in
[1:45:21] the last 15 to 18 years i've done
[1:45:23] nothing but just to the lord i've tried
[1:45:24] to live so close to him
[1:45:26] and not say a word until he told me
[1:45:27] first everything
[1:45:29] people say now if brother brahm tells
[1:45:30] you he's coming remember look out for
[1:45:32] the meeting because he's coming in the
[1:45:33] name of the lord
[1:45:34] he won't do nothing to the lord tell
[1:45:36] that's right i waited till he told me i
[1:45:38] didn't move till he told me
[1:45:39] and then he got so for the last few
[1:45:41] months he didn't tell me nothing about
[1:45:43] places to go
[1:45:45] then i come down from canada and fred or
[1:45:47] brother rory
[1:45:48] told me his dream as he and i and
[1:45:50] brother banks rode along together just
[1:45:51] before we separated
[1:45:53] and then the next day we got down to
[1:45:55] brother fred's and his boy lynn wasn't
[1:45:57] at home so he couldn't come on with us
[1:45:59] him and his wife
[1:46:00] had to wait he picked up his wife there
[1:46:02] at rosewood
[1:46:03] saskatchewan and billy and i came in
[1:46:06] brother fred's truck that night we
[1:46:07] traveled most of night and the next day
[1:46:09] and then on the next morning
[1:46:10] we had left helena montana and was
[1:46:14] coming on towards the border
[1:46:16] and i can stay up till about nine
[1:46:18] o'clock and get sleepy i gotta sleep and
[1:46:20] billy
[1:46:20] he wants to sleep till about 10 o'clock
[1:46:22] the next day when the daylight comes up
[1:46:24] so it makes it pretty good for us to
[1:46:25] travel
[1:46:26] so i got up about four o'clock and got
[1:46:28] started driving and billy was sleeping
[1:46:30] we went into a place and was thinking on
[1:46:32] my mind you know what
[1:46:33] one of these days as soon as i can get
[1:46:35] the wife up there
[1:46:36] i won't tell her what i'm going to do
[1:46:38] but i'd get up there
[1:46:40] and then i'm going to tell her i love
[1:46:41] this place so well
[1:46:43] no need of us going anywhere else let's
[1:46:45] just stay here
[1:46:47] and that's back from civilization 1100
[1:46:49] miles from anywhere
[1:46:51] wouldn't that be great
[1:46:55] way in the wilderness i thought won't
[1:46:57] that be fine i won't have to get a
[1:46:58] haircut
[1:47:02] listen brother branham was a real man
[1:47:06] elijah was a man of like passions as we
[1:47:09] he had temptations just like you have
[1:47:11] temptations
[1:47:12] he had wrong thoughts and wrong ideas
[1:47:14] and selfishness that would creep in
[1:47:16] that's what this is
[1:47:17] selfishness that's coming from pain pain
[1:47:20] of rejection
[1:47:23] and now he is he he's going through the
[1:47:25] same thing
[1:47:26] you and i go through and i'm so thankful
[1:47:29] that god had him tell this and standing
[1:47:32] in the gap so that i could identify
[1:47:34] my hour of temptation
[1:47:40] say that where am i at no haircut where
[1:47:44] is this
[1:47:47] yeah i won't have to get a haircut i
[1:47:49] won't have to dress up
[1:47:50] and i'll just be a regular mountaineer i
[1:47:53] know some
[1:47:54] boys little boys in this church would be
[1:47:56] like yes
[1:47:58] i've got a quote but let me finish
[1:48:02] reading
[1:48:05] i'll be a regular mountaineer what i
[1:48:07] always listen what i always wanted to be
[1:48:11] what i i i
[1:48:14] lucifer i will i
[1:48:18] will i will listen this is when
[1:48:21] spiritual discernment comes in when you
[1:48:22] start saying i
[1:48:24] i i that's time to put the brakes on and
[1:48:27] say god
[1:48:28] where are you you you what do you want
[1:48:30] where do you want me to go
[1:48:32] how do you want me to react i want
[1:48:35] i need i feel i think i would say
[1:48:40] put the emergency brake on there's
[1:48:41] something wrong here there's too much i
[1:48:43] where are you at god and this where do
[1:48:45] you want me to be
[1:48:48] what i always wanted to be i said i got
[1:48:51] some guns and some people give me and
[1:48:53] i'll be a guide like you never heard of
[1:48:55] i'll just love it
[1:48:56] then if the lord tells me go down and
[1:48:58] tell somebody something i'll run out and
[1:48:59] tell them and come back again
[1:49:01] and i'll help bud and we'll really have
[1:49:03] a real place here i was thinking on that
[1:49:06] we went into a restaurant to eat a
[1:49:07] little place in the mountain just about
[1:49:09] seven o'clock
[1:49:10] it was getting a little late so i woke
[1:49:11] billy up we was out of gasoline so i had
[1:49:14] to get some gasoline
[1:49:15] i i love this friends
[1:49:19] brother branham is not he's not at the
[1:49:22] altar at the church praying for 10 hours
[1:49:24] when god starts to speak to him
[1:49:25] he's driving down the road and he
[1:49:27] realized i got to get some gasoline
[1:49:30] and where he's going to need gasoline is
[1:49:33] where god is going to show him something
[1:49:35] in a diner
[1:49:38] don't think the footsteps of the
[1:49:39] righteous are not ordered to the lord
[1:49:41] god does the same thing for you and i if
[1:49:43] we'll just wake up and pay attention
[1:49:48] i had to get some gasoline and went to
[1:49:49] this little place this little restaurant
[1:49:51] and while there a man come across the
[1:49:53] street maybe teeny bit older than i was
[1:49:55] but he looked like a man to me
[1:49:58] he had on a pair of overalls overall
[1:50:00] jacket riding boots a black hat
[1:50:02] whiskers down his face like this snow
[1:50:04] white his hair hanging out from under
[1:50:06] back of his hat
[1:50:07] i thought that looks like a man not some
[1:50:10] soft lazy with a cigar in his mouth
[1:50:12] about that long sitting with a pair of
[1:50:13] shorts
[1:50:14] around some patio or swimming pool some
[1:50:16] pot bellied easterner like
[1:50:18] excuse that expression
[1:50:25] excuse that expression but however the
[1:50:27] guy looked like a man to me
[1:50:29] hard rough looked like he lived where
[1:50:31] god made men to live
[1:50:33] and i was admiring him
[1:50:38] see this is an hour of temptation
[1:50:43] this is the temptation in the wilderness
[1:50:46] brother branham is being tempted and
[1:50:48] he's been he's being drawn away of his
[1:50:50] own lusts can we see it
[1:50:54] if we can see it in him can we see it in
[1:50:56] us this is the whole point
[1:50:58] that we finally get to where i can say i
[1:51:00] can see that in me
[1:51:02] amen i've saw me all down through my
[1:51:04] past every mistake i can see this
[1:51:06] same scenario he's getting me to doubt
[1:51:09] my sonship
[1:51:10] trying to prove something trying to get
[1:51:11] ahead of god's schedule trying to save
[1:51:13] myself
[1:51:14] trying to deliver myself trying to have
[1:51:17] my own way
[1:51:20] brother man was admiring him listen the
[1:51:22] devil knows how to tempt us
[1:51:24] he didn't tempt him with something he
[1:51:25] didn't want now he's now
[1:51:27] in the hour of pressure when the
[1:51:28] pressure is building on the prophet and
[1:51:30] the prophet is now depressed
[1:51:31] amen and he's struggling with the
[1:51:33] rejection after the opening of the seals
[1:51:35] when when they rejected the opening of
[1:51:37] the word
[1:51:38] now when he's struggling with that he
[1:51:39] doesn't tempt him to go to the casino
[1:51:41] and gamble
[1:51:45] he's tempting him to go be alone with
[1:51:48] god in the woods
[1:51:51] see the temptation for you many times
[1:51:54] now if you serve the lord for a period
[1:51:56] of time
[1:51:56] god is not the devil's not trying to
[1:51:58] tempt you into vulgar sin
[1:52:00] he's just trying to tempt you to put
[1:52:02] yourself first and step back from god's
[1:52:04] program
[1:52:06] the temptation is to pull you away from
[1:52:08] a life of sacrifice
[1:52:09] and a life of surrender and to
[1:52:11] self-preservation and he always comes
[1:52:13] with a religious
[1:52:16] with a religious tone
[1:52:20] go out in the wilderness
[1:52:23] and be with god and get away from
[1:52:26] civilization and be alone with god
[1:52:28] as god's prophet when he tells me
[1:52:29] something else come out of the woods and
[1:52:30] i'll tell him and i'll go back to the
[1:52:32] woods
[1:52:33] oh boy it sounded good it sounded
[1:52:35] religious but it was not
[1:52:37] god's plan amen
[1:52:41] he come into the restaurant and ordered
[1:52:43] some pancakes there was about 15
[1:52:44] 20 people he had to he had to sneeze and
[1:52:46] you know how some people will
[1:52:48] and brother bryan it says injected here
[1:52:50] he imitates
[1:52:51] a little sneeze i should just play it
[1:52:53] for you
[1:52:55] he said pardon me but he let out a great
[1:52:58] big healthy wood sneeze
[1:53:00] kertuey maya it looked like the windows
[1:53:02] blasted
[1:53:06] when he did nobody dared to say nothing
[1:53:12] no sir i said billy there is a man after
[1:53:14] my own heart
[1:53:21] you know we laugh now but this was
[1:53:23] really happening to the prophet he was
[1:53:26] really entertaining these thoughts he
[1:53:28] was really struggling with his position
[1:53:30] he was struggling with the rejection and
[1:53:32] he was struggling
[1:53:33] with the pressure the tension the
[1:53:35] rejection the depression
[1:53:38] and he was looking for a way out and in
[1:53:40] looking for a way out
[1:53:41] his mind amen the devil was planting
[1:53:44] seeds and the seeds didn't sound bad
[1:53:46] because the seeds lined up to what the
[1:53:48] desire of his heart was
[1:53:50] he always wanted to be a wilderness man
[1:53:53] a mountain man be in the woods be a
[1:53:54] trapper be
[1:53:55] a hunter and be a guide go way up away
[1:53:58] from civilization
[1:53:59] brother branham wasn't looking at
[1:54:01] running away amen and
[1:54:03] becoming a heathen and becoming a sinner
[1:54:05] he was thinking
[1:54:06] he was thinking going up there and
[1:54:07] talking to god and meditating and being
[1:54:09] away
[1:54:10] and focusing on the lord
[1:54:14] but he was doing it for himself not for
[1:54:16] god
[1:54:18] and if we really could hone down our
[1:54:20] discernment
[1:54:21] and say how much of what i do do i do
[1:54:24] for myself and how much of what i do do
[1:54:25] i do for god
[1:54:29] i mean then we're really getting into
[1:54:31] dialing in
[1:54:32] the the discernment amen and i i'm
[1:54:34] praying god will help
[1:54:36] me to recognize this because i recognize
[1:54:37] it in myself too late too many times
[1:54:40] that i did that with selfish motives i
[1:54:42] did that for myself i did that for my
[1:54:44] own protection i did that
[1:54:46] for the for how it would look in the
[1:54:47] eyes of somebody else i did it for how
[1:54:49] it would sound
[1:54:50] amen but i don't want to be motivated by
[1:54:52] that i want to do what god wants me to
[1:54:54] do
[1:54:55] for him i want to live a life for him
[1:54:58] that's what i really want amen
[1:55:00] and i'm praying that god gives us the
[1:55:01] discernment amen to recognize
[1:55:04] that old tempter when he's coming in
[1:55:05] because he doesn't use
[1:55:07] you know a snake-like voice and a deep
[1:55:09] booming evil devil voice he uses your
[1:55:12] voice when he whispers in your ear
[1:55:14] and it feels like your thought but it's
[1:55:16] his thought because it's contrary to the
[1:55:18] will and plan of going
[1:55:24] i said billy there's a man after my own
[1:55:26] heart said oh daddy you don't want to be
[1:55:28] like that
[1:55:29] that's that's what that's me in the
[1:55:31] future
[1:55:32] see i said that's me
[1:55:37] this is the hour of temptation
[1:55:41] that's me that's what i want to be
[1:55:44] that's what i'm going to do
[1:55:45] he was in the process of making up his
[1:55:47] mind
[1:55:48] he had saw what he wanted and he
[1:55:50] declared that's me
[1:55:51] there you go billy that's a man after my
[1:55:53] own heart he said oh daddy you don't
[1:55:55] want to be like that he said no that's
[1:55:56] me in the future that's me did he want
[1:56:00] it
[1:56:01] yes he wanted it
[1:56:04] he was being enticed of his own lusts
[1:56:11] i sat there a little bit and billy
[1:56:12] looked up at me and kept on eating his
[1:56:14] pancake i was finishing mine
[1:56:16] i was finished mine and a few minutes
[1:56:18] somebody in a booth right around front
[1:56:19] of us with the boards this way back of
[1:56:21] the booth
[1:56:22] i couldn't see around a man got up that
[1:56:24] looked exactly my profile
[1:56:27] about 75 years old little bitty fellow
[1:56:29] his clothes tied on him ragged
[1:56:31] and the buddy that got up with him was
[1:56:32] fletcher broy exactly
[1:56:34] gray hair hanging in his face and billy
[1:56:36] looked around he said daddy that looks
[1:56:38] like you and fletcher
[1:56:40] you can imagine how i felt and the
[1:56:43] little fella looked like me wobbled up
[1:56:45] you know they had been standing over a
[1:56:47] campfire with smoke all over them faces
[1:56:49] dirty
[1:56:50] i think their breakfast together the man
[1:56:52] must have paid 20 cents maybe a cup of
[1:56:54] coffee or something
[1:56:55] my heart bounced within me and i watched
[1:56:59] and billy said what's the matter with
[1:57:00] you i said nothing
[1:57:02] and i watched that and they went around
[1:57:04] and went out
[1:57:05] he said daddy what's the matter i said
[1:57:07] nothing and he got in the car
[1:57:09] he said he said do you mind driving
[1:57:11] again i said nope he said i'm still
[1:57:12] sleepy
[1:57:14] so he went to sleep and i went speeding
[1:57:16] down the road about
[1:57:17] 55 miles an hour in the truck over the
[1:57:19] mountain coming on towards the border
[1:57:21] down to coming home to arizona but i was
[1:57:24] coming now into utah
[1:57:26] and as i got there coming down from the
[1:57:27] mountains about 20 miles out of the city
[1:57:30] you heard it as as i told you about the
[1:57:32] morning about the squirrels and all
[1:57:33] those things how
[1:57:34] somebody went to talking to me a voice
[1:57:37] just the same as you hear mine
[1:57:38] i know it sounds neurotically but as
[1:57:40] i've got through expressing
[1:57:42] have i ever told you anything but what
[1:57:44] was right and a voice got to talking i
[1:57:46] was talking to him
[1:57:47] it said carry out your plans and you'll
[1:57:49] be like that
[1:57:51] i said lord i don't want to be like that
[1:57:54] said your wife will go too she won't
[1:57:56] live up there in them hills like that
[1:57:58] and you'll become a bum just as the
[1:57:59] dream showed you you would be
[1:58:02] i said i don't want to be that but i i
[1:58:05] don't want to have to live like that
[1:58:07] now when brother man says this i don't
[1:58:08] want to have to live like that he's
[1:58:10] talking about the way he's living
[1:58:13] as a minister and a prophet and
[1:58:14] traveling around and all the rejection
[1:58:16] he said but i don't want to have to live
[1:58:18] like that
[1:58:19] i want to do something different i was
[1:58:22] told that
[1:58:23] you had called me to be a prophet i want
[1:58:25] to live in the wilderness like the
[1:58:26] prophet
[1:58:27] but i was using my own excuse so i could
[1:58:29] hunt my own good
[1:58:32] oh friends when deception when
[1:58:36] when self-willed deception starts to
[1:58:38] creep in and the minute it takes on
[1:58:40] religious tone that is the worst
[1:58:42] deception of all
[1:58:45] prophet of god is struggling he doesn't
[1:58:47] have wrong desire he doesn't want to do
[1:58:48] evil he doesn't want to do wrong
[1:58:50] he doesn't want to displease the lord
[1:58:52] but under the pressure he's under amen
[1:58:54] and under all the things that he's
[1:58:55] suffering with he he has this little
[1:58:57] idea and the devil's planting a seed and
[1:58:59] making a plan
[1:59:00] you could run up to the wilderness you
[1:59:01] could be the mountain man you always
[1:59:03] want to be
[1:59:03] you could take your family up there look
[1:59:05] think of the peace and just talk to god
[1:59:07] and when god says something you can
[1:59:08] storm out and god begins to talk to him
[1:59:10] and tell him
[1:59:11] you'll be just like those bums if you
[1:59:12] carry out your plan
[1:59:14] he said but lord i don't want to live
[1:59:15] like this
[1:59:18] i want to you told me that i was a
[1:59:20] prophet i want to live in the mountains
[1:59:22] like the prophets did
[1:59:25] but here he gets honest but i was using
[1:59:28] my own excuse
[1:59:31] and it was religious
[1:59:34] it matched certain characteristics of
[1:59:37] prophets in the bible
[1:59:39] you understand just because you've got a
[1:59:43] scripture to justify what you're doing
[1:59:44] doesn't mean you're right
[1:59:47] just because you can find a quote to
[1:59:48] match what you want to do doesn't mean
[1:59:50] it's right
[1:59:52] it's right because it's right
[1:59:55] do you give what i'm saying not because
[1:59:58] you wanted a certain thing
[2:00:00] and you searched to tell you could find
[2:00:02] something that would allow you to do
[2:00:04] what you already wanted to do
[2:00:05] no it's right because it's right by god
[2:00:08] because it's god's plan for you because
[2:00:09] it's god what god wants you to do
[2:00:11] that's when it's right amen but when we
[2:00:14] take the word in a religious way and
[2:00:16] religious tones and religious
[2:00:17] explanations
[2:00:18] and begin to justify our own desires
[2:00:21] friends we're going to end and ruin
[2:00:23] that's not what god wants for us
[2:00:26] he wants preeminence he doesn't want us
[2:00:29] to take the word
[2:00:30] and twist it so we can have our own
[2:00:31] pleasure
[2:00:33] or protect ourselves from what he has
[2:00:36] ordained
[2:00:38] brother branham wanted to protect
[2:00:40] himself from rejection
[2:00:42] but god didn't want him protected from
[2:00:44] rejection
[2:00:46] he had to be rejected because christ is
[2:00:49] always rejected
[2:00:54] he couldn't protect paul from the
[2:00:55] stoning could have protected him from
[2:00:57] arrest
[2:00:58] he could have delivered him from prison
[2:01:00] he did before
[2:01:02] he did in one city but he didn't in
[2:01:04] another
[2:01:06] man we've got to get to the place where
[2:01:08] it's got to be god and only god
[2:01:11] i said god that's where i want to be
[2:01:13] help me lord
[2:01:15] but i was using my own excuse so i could
[2:01:16] hunt my own good
[2:01:18] and he said but that was the prophets of
[2:01:20] the old testament you've been called to
[2:01:22] be
[2:01:22] there in a much higher office than that
[2:01:25] he said you have more gifts besides that
[2:01:26] you was called to pray for the sick and
[2:01:28] preach the gospel in
[2:01:29] the apostolic form you know of greater
[2:01:31] things many great gifts he said
[2:01:33] why do you wait for me to move you every
[2:01:35] time you move where's your reward when i
[2:01:37] then i seen and then said do you
[2:01:38] remember i told you do you remember
[2:01:40] what brother roberson told you in your
[2:01:42] dream in his dream or vision
[2:01:44] that you had done like moses you forgot
[2:01:45] the feeling of your people
[2:01:47] you forgot the call that i called you to
[2:01:51] i let the sick lay i want the lord to
[2:01:53] tell me
[2:01:54] where to go and not to go that's wrong i
[2:01:57] had built myself a complex
[2:02:01] i love the way he says that i had built
[2:02:04] myself a complex because the people
[2:02:06] didn't hear my message
[2:02:09] if you say i have a complex
[2:02:14] i want to ask you did you build yourself
[2:02:17] a complex
[2:02:21] because you can have a complex if you
[2:02:22] want one the devil will hand you the
[2:02:24] bricks and you can keep setting them in
[2:02:25] place
[2:02:28] nobody loves you they reject you
[2:02:31] nobody understands you or you can take
[2:02:34] the brick and say
[2:02:35] that's not true
[2:02:39] brother branham built himself a complex
[2:02:43] because the people didn't hear his
[2:02:44] message amen
[2:02:47] and so don't build yourself a complex
[2:02:50] they didn't shake my hand they don't
[2:02:52] love me everybody else gets together i
[2:02:53] don't get together on sunday
[2:02:55] don't build yourself a complex you say
[2:02:58] whatever god wants for my life is what i
[2:03:00] want from my life
[2:03:01] if he wants me rejected forgotten
[2:03:03] overlooked and
[2:03:06] he's my god whatever he wants is what i
[2:03:08] want don't build yourself a complex
[2:03:10] friends
[2:03:12] i built myself a complex because the
[2:03:14] people didn't hear my message
[2:03:16] and god forbid that i'll try to compare
[2:03:17] the life of my life now like moses but
[2:03:19] it's exactly what moses did the people
[2:03:21] wouldn't listen to him
[2:03:22] when he come to deliver him so he just
[2:03:24] left them alone and went into the
[2:03:25] wilderness
[2:03:26] but god turned him around and he had
[2:03:28] long forgotten the suffering
[2:03:29] people brother branham confessed that he
[2:03:32] had done the same thing i let the sick
[2:03:33] lay
[2:03:34] and i had gifted healing to take to the
[2:03:35] world and i was pulling back
[2:03:37] because i had been rejected and they
[2:03:39] didn't hear the message and i let sick
[2:03:40] people lay and withheld the gift from
[2:03:42] people
[2:03:43] and he was told that he was wrong and he
[2:03:44] said god forgive me
[2:03:46] but guess what god turned moses and god
[2:03:48] turned this prophet
[2:03:50] he took his correction he repented amen
[2:03:53] he stood up
[2:03:53] and he told the church amen and he
[2:03:55] repented of it and he prayed and he got
[2:03:57] back the feeling for the people when he
[2:03:58] went back to the field
[2:04:02] i say praise god for his correction
[2:04:07] we have to have discernment in this hour
[2:04:13] jeremiah let's turn to jeremiah i want
[2:04:15] to read two more scriptures as we close
[2:04:18] jeremiah
[2:04:23] 17
[2:04:27] and 9.
[2:04:32] jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful
[2:04:37] above all things and desperately wicked
[2:04:40] who can know it
[2:04:44] your heart will deceive you brother
[2:04:46] branham
[2:04:47] wanted he desired to be a mountain man
[2:04:51] and go to the mountain
[2:04:52] be a prophet alone with god and stomp
[2:04:54] out with the message deliver and go back
[2:04:57] he wanted but when he got real honest
[2:04:58] with himself what he really wanted
[2:05:00] was an excuse to go off and hunt and
[2:05:02] have his own way
[2:05:05] the heart is deceitfully desperately
[2:05:07] wicked it's deceitful above all things
[2:05:08] desperately wicked who can know it
[2:05:11] brother branham further down and
[2:05:12] standing in the gap he comes back and he
[2:05:13] says but the call of god must come
[2:05:16] whoever wants to march towards the
[2:05:17] promised land let him march we are on
[2:05:19] our road to prom
[2:05:20] the promised land amen let them come
[2:05:22] march we're on our road
[2:05:23] to meet christ at the end time and i
[2:05:25] wanted to bring this to you so that you
[2:05:27] could see
[2:05:28] and show you the mistake that a man can
[2:05:30] make
[2:05:31] yet being sincere
[2:05:34] brother branham wasn't being insincere
[2:05:37] he didn't want to stop serving god he
[2:05:38] didn't want to stop his commission and
[2:05:40] being a prophet he didn't
[2:05:41] he didn't want to turn his back on the
[2:05:43] lord he was being sincere
[2:05:45] amen but but he was enticed of his own
[2:05:48] lust and it was beginning to lead him
[2:05:49] away
[2:05:51] and brother graham said i wanted to
[2:05:52] bring this to you so that you would see
[2:05:54] and show you that the mistake that a man
[2:05:56] can make yet
[2:05:57] being sincere you can be sincere still
[2:06:01] want to serve the lord but you want to
[2:06:02] do it your own way amen
[2:06:04] and i say god bring me back to your way
[2:06:08] for the last scripture let's read psalm
[2:06:14] 139.
[2:06:20] psalm 139 and verse
[2:06:23] 23 and 24.
[2:06:32] search me o god and know my heart
[2:06:35] we just read that the heart is
[2:06:38] deceitfully wicked it's deceitful above
[2:06:40] all and desperately wicked who can know
[2:06:42] it
[2:06:43] but here david says search me o god and
[2:06:46] know my heart
[2:06:47] try me and know my thoughts and see if
[2:06:51] there be any wicked way in me
[2:06:53] and lead me in the way everlasting what
[2:06:58] a prayer
[2:07:00] after i read this now i used to read
[2:07:01] this differently but when i read it now
[2:07:04] i used to read it like david was saying
[2:07:06] search me
[2:07:08] i'm perfect see i'm fine
[2:07:11] but now i don't know if that was david
[2:07:12] was saying because look how david fell
[2:07:14] with bathsheba
[2:07:15] his heart wasn't right he was being
[2:07:18] selfish as lust he was enticed of his
[2:07:20] own lust and led away
[2:07:21] until he could commit murder
[2:07:26] let's read it again search me o god
[2:07:29] and know my heart because sometimes i
[2:07:31] can't even know my own heart
[2:07:34] i'm sincere but the devil is using my
[2:07:37] my my own the pressures around me and my
[2:07:40] own feelings and my own desires
[2:07:41] he's using them and twisting them
[2:07:43] against your will oh god
[2:07:45] but i'm sincere and i love you and i
[2:07:47] want to do right
[2:07:49] search me oh god and know my heart try
[2:07:51] me and know my thoughts
[2:07:54] and see if there be any wicked way in me
[2:07:57] and lead me
[2:07:58] in the way everlasting
[2:08:02] i said that would be a good prayer to
[2:08:03] end on say lord search
[2:08:05] me try my thoughts see if there's any
[2:08:09] wicked way in me lord and lead me
[2:08:11] in the way everlasting
[2:08:15] pray friends for discernment
[2:08:19] we'll look at the devil's tactics and
[2:08:20] watch how he comes
[2:08:22] it's it's got to be deceitful to deceive
[2:08:24] the bride
[2:08:25] it's got to look good amen and when it
[2:08:28] begins to
[2:08:28] question your brideship throw it out
[2:08:31] when it gets you to serve self
[2:08:33] throw it out when it gets you to put
[2:08:35] yourself above god's will throw it out
[2:08:37] discern those spirits resist the devil
[2:08:39] and he shall
[2:08:41] flee let's all stand musicians if you
[2:08:43] could come please
