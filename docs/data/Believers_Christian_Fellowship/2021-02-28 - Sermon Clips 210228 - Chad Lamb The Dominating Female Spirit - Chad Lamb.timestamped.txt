[0:00] and now he comes down to verse 30 he
[0:02] said i can
[0:03] of mine own self do nothing
[0:07] listen friends what an example for us
[0:10] amen yes we are the bride yes it is
[0:12] jesus christ yes you are the word
[0:14] but you cannot act independently of the
[0:16] male amen
[0:17] you cannot go off on your own you cannot
[0:19] make up your own way you can't go by
[0:21] your own feelings you can't
[0:22] you have to stay tied to the male
[0:24] because your expression is not male your
[0:26] expression is female
[0:29] this is the hour for total surrender
[0:31] total submission and then total patience
[0:33] and waiting on god
[0:35] because without him we can do nothing
[0:37] he's the vine we're the branches
[0:39] amen the vine the the vine has come back
[0:42] amen the word has come back
[0:43] the male has come back to produce life
[0:47] but i cannot act independent of that god
[0:49] has taken the two and put them back
[0:50] together
[0:51] to reproduce the son of man again but i
[0:54] can't do it without him i
[0:56] in myself though in me down in my soul
[0:58] is a portion of god himself
[1:00] i cannot do it independently of the rest
[1:03] of the portion of god
[1:06] god has set it up to where these
[1:07] expressions must now come together to
[1:10] bring forth life
[1:12] the female expression independent of the
[1:14] male will bring death amen like it did
[1:16] in the garden
[1:16] amen and the male must have the female
[1:19] expression to bring forth life
[1:21] because that's the way god set it up
[1:23] amen god amen wanted a male expression
[1:25] and a female expression and here in the
[1:27] end time because there was a prophet
[1:29] here
[1:29] to unite the two the two have come
[1:31] together to produce life amen to be
[1:34] fruit on the vine again to be the very
[1:36] life of jesus christ
[1:37] on display in the formation of the bride
[1:42] but we have to stay true to our position
[1:44] just like
[1:45] just as much as jesus stayed true to his
[1:48] position
