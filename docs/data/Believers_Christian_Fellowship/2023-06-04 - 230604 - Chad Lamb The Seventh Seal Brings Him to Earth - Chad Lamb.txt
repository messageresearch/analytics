doing pretty good but thank God I appreciate the Lord's goodness and I appreciate the people as dark as the world is they're not afraid for any gift God gives for life to come to this world some were afraid to bring children into the world but but if God gives the life God has a purpose for that life in this Dark Age and so we're not afraid we know what God gives God will take care of Amen and while we're standing let's turn to Revelation chapter 8 together we'll look at verse one and I want to welcome our visitors sister Samantha's most parents are here God bless you it's good to have you with us in the service and also I'm a good friend brother Irvin Ray Miller and his wife are sitting right here brother Irvin is from The Junction City group that me and Kyle went down to minister to we saw them baptized so make sure you greet them and shake their hand out their service God bless you it's good to have you both in the service today amen it worked out good they had a wedding to attend just north of here yesterday for a family member so they were in the neighborhood and so I thank God that he brought him our way amen so let's look here at Revelation chapter 8 verse one while we're still standing it says and when you open the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour man God bless you as you take your seats and then I'd like to minister on a subject titled it the seventh seal brings him to Earth this is a phrase brother Branham uses it comes out of the message Souls that are in prison now and we'll take a look at that in just a few minutes when we get to that and I'll just share with you what my inspiration is and what I've been thinking but uh as we look at this we we find that when we when we look at the Book of Revelation we come through the Book of Revelation we come through the church ages and and chapters two and three and we come to chapter four when John is caught up and he sees one on the throne and he sees a book in his hand and the book is sealed with Seven Seals and and there's a cry going out for one who is worthy to take the book and loose the seals thereof and then we we see the the line of the tribe of Judah steps forward he steps forward as a slain lamb we know this is the picture of Jesus Christ and he comes to take the book and when he takes the book then he loosens the seals and then that's chapter five and then in chapter six we see the opening of six of the Seven Seals and we see them open in symbol form a symbol that represented a truth that was laying there and it went out as a symbol of a white horse rider or or a a red horse rider or a black horse rider pale horse rider so his opening in symbol form the the show that there's a truth laying here there's a mystery here and it opened in symbolic form but with without giving the revelation of the symbols and then we see the injection of Revelations chapter 7 and then we come to Revelation chapter 8 and this is the scripture we just read this is when he opens the seventh seal when you open the seventh seal there were silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and then this silence there's no symbols given there's there's nothing that would give you an indication or a clue amen about the truth that's laying in the seventh seal amen but it's one of the seals that sealed up the book that was in the hand of the one on the throne the the one that the lamb had overcome to redeem that he has a slain lamb had paid the price that he was the sacrifice amen that could buy back Redemption buy back what Adam had lost and now he comes and takes the book which we know is the title deed to all of creation and he takes it and he loosens the seals and then loosing the seals is unlocking the great mystery of what's contained in the book and how it got in the book and why it's in the book and and why it had to be redeemed and all about Redemption is sealed up in this book and then the sixth break I said like I said in symbolic form but the seventh there was silence and when we come over to Revelations chapter 10 now we find another book and brother Brown tells us this is the same book that was closed in Revelations chapter 5 now in Revelation chapter 10 it's open and it's in the hand of the mighty Angel which is Christ and let's let's read together Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was where the sun and his feet as pillars of fire this imagery it matches the imagery and description of Christ if we go back to Revelation chapter 1 amen let's just go back to Revelation chapter one and and I'll just uh uh just freely admit to you that I'm going off the cuff here I'm going without notes but I'm just leading and following the leading of the spirit amen but but we want to see here that that in Revelation chapter 1 John now is receiving a revelation amen and he's on the Isle of Patmos and let's go down to verse 9. John chapter or Revelation 1 9 I John who also am your brother and companion and tribulation in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voices of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seeest writing a book and send it into the seven Church churches which are in Asia and to Ephesus and to Smyrna to pergamus unto thyatira and this artist unto Philadelphia unto laodicea so what we see is that voice is declaring itself I'm Alpha and Omega first and last this is Jesus Christ and in verse 12 says and I turn to see the voice that spoke with me so he turned to see a voice that's interesting language amendments the voice of God and he turned to see The Voice being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and when he turned to see the verse The Voice the first thing he sees the seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle amen and brother Benham early in his ministry he says amen this is in female form gird around the paps and the paps in the Bible were always the breast and we see him in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the church so here is Christ one like the son of man in the midst of the church and the Seven Church ages amen gird around the paths which later brother Brahm also said is the place the sash is worn for judgment amen or I mean priesthood I'm sorry and then no no judgment yeah that's right and so then he says I want to read this again in the midst of the seven going cancels one like unto the son of man clothed with the Garment down to the foot and gird about the paths with a golden girdle in his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow in his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burn in the furnace and his voice is the sound of many Waters it's interesting he said one like unto the son of man he doesn't say it was the son of man but one like unto the son and this is one in the same image as the son of man and it's in the midst of the seven Church ages and it's in female form and the voice was the voice of many Waters and we know the interpretation of many Waters in the Bible is many peoples Nations and tongues so this is Christ through the churches Christ through his bride amen and he's showing it in a full picture amen this is a preview of what he's coming to in fullness and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth with a sharp two-edges sword and his countenance was as the sun shining in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death so we know this is Jesus Christ speaking but his voice was the voice of many Waters His Image he was in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and we see some things that describe him his head and hair were white like wool clothed the Garment down to the foot amen Gert about to pass with the golden girdle with hairs and head white like wolves white as snow eyes is a flame of fire feet like in the fine brasses that they have been burnt voice of many Waters amen his in his countenance was as the sun shining in his strength verse 16. so now we come back to Revelation 10. let's go back to revelation 10. and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head a rainbow is the the Covenant sign that was given to Noah and it was the promise of God that I will no longer destroy the world with a flood it was a promise to the people of Mercy a promise of God's salvation and now he has the rainbow Covenant because he is God's promise of salvation he is the escape from judgment he was clothed with the cloud and rainbow was upon us and his feet his face was as it were the son his countenance as the sun his face as it were the son and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open not closed now but open and he set his right foot upon the scene is left foot upon the Earth and cried with the loud voices when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which is seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that there and are in the sea and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so there was one great mystery which is the mystery of God and that mystery was going to remain sealed up or silent until the seventh angel begins to sound then the mystery of God should be finished as he is declared to a service to prophets and we know that the seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seventh unders uttered their voices they uttered something intelligible they under uttered something that could be understood because John was about to write what the seven Thunders uttered so they communicated something they disclosed something and John was going to write it down amen but but the voice from Heaven told him to not write it but seal up amen so the voices were then put back in silence only John heard it amen and when John heard it he was about to write because that's what he was told to do write the things that he sees and he hears and put it in a book amen but he he goes to write it and he's told don't write it but seal it up so so there's something else the seven Thunders were to remain sealed amen until a later time and we live in the later time amen we live in the end time amen when the seven Thunders are to be unsealed and the Seven Thunders amen they contained the revelation of what the symbols were amen back in Revelation chapter 6 amen but but but Revelation chapter 8 when the seventh seal was opened there was silence why because the opening of the seventh seal amen and the Seven Thunders are tied together they were silenced they spoke but they were silent so that we could see it's in the word that something's there something was said because brother Branham he used to think that these Seven Seals amen they're still he said he used to say it like this there's seals on the inside of the book on the back side of the book and he would say the front side and the backside he would make statements about these seals and seals that are open and seals that are closed amen and what brother Brown was seeing is he's seeing amen the opening of The Seven Seals in symbol form but he's also seeing there's something else sealed seven Thunders are sealed amen by the voice of Heaven telling John to seal them up and he knows they have to be open and brother Benham used to think those are something that's not even written in the word but then he said you can't add to and you can't take away amen so God had to show it here in Revelation 10 so that we would know that those were voices that spoke that relayed some information some Revelation but it had to be sealed so it had to be put in the book so we would know but it was silenced in this book when the lamb opens it in Revelation 8 it's silent when it speaks then it was silenced again so the seventh seal in the revelation of seven Thunders are linked together and it has something to do with the mystery of God being finished that's what I so want to look at today by the help of God amen and I I get to to places like this where you look and you look and you read and you read and you meditate and you get to the point where you've read so much and you just don't want to read anymore you just you just I just want the reality of everything I've read and everything that prophets told us I get to the place where I I'm studying this I just can't study anymore I told my wife I get to the place where I just got to go preach it because I'm just fiddling with it it's too much and I just don't I don't I don't like my notes I don't I got too much stuff and I get rid of half of what I got and I just got to come and preach and share what's on my heart and ask God to pull it out because this this seventh seal we we live in the end time we know that as Believers we believe we're in the end time and that's the time of the the last Angel's message and when the last Angel begins to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets and we live in that age amen where the mystery of God's finished we're the Seven Seals have been revealed where the seven Thunders have sounded amen and it's all to do something it's all for a purpose amen and it's all to bring about a manifestation it's all to bring something to pass and and so I'm gonna take a look at a few quotes here but I want you to remember the title of the seventh seal brings him to Earth and that's a direct statement from a message and we'll get to that just in a minute and I pray that God will will help bring things clear not confusing but clear in the message the seven seal the prophet says the eighth chapter only reveals the scene of the seven seal where nothing else is revealed because it was silence now nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of Revelations it's the revealing of the Seven Seals perfectly mute and if I only had time I'll try a few places to show you all the way back from Genesis the 7th chapter the seventh seal is spoke of from the very beginning in Genesis this seventh these seals move right up that's such an interesting statement and for a while I would say that statement perplexed me because I was looking at the seals as something to do with the New Testament only because it it laps over the church ages and all of these other things and now he says all the way back in Genesis you can see the seventh seal you can see these seals from the very beginning moving right up and so I always like to go back to the beginning so let's go back to to Genesis chapter 1. we've done this many times this is not something we have not ever gone through before but I just want to reintroduce the foundation and re-familiarize ourselves with these scriptures and then move forward from there in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image that God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fount of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and God said behold I have given you every herb-bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree and which is the fruit of fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and every fowl of the air into everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good in the evening in the morning were the sixth day let's go over to chapter 2 thus at the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made so we see now God in the sixth day in the making of man he made the male and female he told them to multiply and replenish and subdue the Earth bring it under Dominion have dominion over the Earth and when he's seen all that he had made he said behold it is very good and when he said it was very good then he moved into his rest he moved into the seventh day and in the seventh day he ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from the work which he had made and we've been through this several times but we always ask the question did God need to rest was he tired were the previous six thousand years taxing on him into a place where he had to rest no but this rest of God is very uh interesting because the Bible is a very interesting book amen the prophet of God tells us that the Bible condenses its truths it's got to bring the whole revelation of God Amen of Jesus Christ and bring it into these pages and it condenses its truths amen and and it's also hidden and revealed in Simplicity and brother remember says the the true meaning is read between the lines like a love letter when somebody writes to you a personal note and they they make innuendos or little statements that only you and them would know and you get the meaning but a stranger picking up the letter wouldn't get the meeting brother Adam said that's how this Bible's written amen it's written to his bride it's written to his elect amen and by Revelation she catches what he's saying and then God took his rest I don't believe God was tired I don't believe he was out there with a pickaxe and a shovel until he had blisters on his hands but after he had made everything that he had made in the six days and he had put man and Dominion of it all and given him destructions to multiply and replenish take dominion and bring something so subjection all of my creation now he could take his rest because he could rest while his son was in charge he arrested from all that it created and all he made he wasn't creating a making anymore now he put rulership of everything he created and made he put it into the hands of his son and his son's wife and now amen if I could say it this way this seventh day is the silence of God God's not the queen God's not working God's not the one Speaking he's not the one that's positioning and moving he's not doing all of that amen God went to take his rest but now his son is the one doing that his son is decreeing and taking dominion and keeping and ordering and protecting his son now it's not that there's no work taking place amen but the work is not being done by God is being done by the son of God yeah amen so we see a silence in the seventh day brother bam said this is all the way back in Genesis all the way back in the beginning amen we see and we see a Breaking of a revelation of six days or six seals we see the breaking of the first day there's light the breaking of the second day and we see a breaking and under the breaking amen we see something under that seal which coming into manifestation but when it comes into the seventh we don't see anything all we see is God rests now he's not decreeing now he's not speaking now there's a silence in the seventh day but in the seventh day there's still something happening amen because now in the seventh day amen there's a Son of God and there's a daughter of God who are united together as one flesh taking dominion over the Earth this is what's going to happen in the great seventh day which is the Millennium the thousandth year we've come 6 000 years since the fall and in six thousand years God went back to work he was resting leaving Dominion to his son but when his son fell amen it ruined the Great Masterpiece of God which God's Masterpiece was a masterpiece family for the prophet of God says in the message Masterpiece God's Masterpiece amen it wasn't done when he just created the son he looked at the Sun and he said not good that man should dwell alone I'm not finished yet there's a there's something this picture is not what I had in my mind yet it's not good that he should dwell alone and so in order to make a wife for him he takes out of him amen takes out of him a rib a part of Adam to become a further expression of Adam and he takes the feminine life that was in Adam and puts it in this second vessel which was made from the elements of Adam amen and now we have Adam and Adam [Music] Adam male Adam female Adam in a further expression out of Adam is now the female and then he the knights them back together and what is the first marriage amen and and Humanity in our Bible Amen in that first marriage now he looks at it all and says it's very good and now he can take his rest now the Masterpiece is finished it wasn't just a masterpiece male it's a masterpiece family and in the Masterpiece he gives a decree multiply replenish fill the Earth and subdue it this is God's masterpiece then the enemy comes in and through deception he ruins God's Masterpiece and in the ruining of the Masterpiece now God moves out of his rest and he comes down to re begin Redemption of a fallen race and then first thing he does is when he comes amen he comes and declares what's happened he passes judgment amen he gives a prophecy of a redeemer coming the seed of the woman which will bruise the Serpent's head amen so he comes down and he starts with judgment then he gives a prophecy and then he slays the lamb to start the work of redemption and then for six thousand years he's been building back the masterpiece bringing back the image of what was falling in the whole Old Testament amen amen was was the Patriarchs and the prophets and God building building building amen he he starts with Abraham amen he builds and he builds and he comes to the nation of Israel and he brings him to the promised land and he builds all the way up to David he builds all the way up to Solomon amen and he comes through the prophets and he comes to the Psalms amen until finally the perfect one that all the prophets were expressing amen that all the prophecies were expressing that all the Patriarchs were expressing the perfect one comes on the scene which is Jesus Christ himself God and flesh and he was the fullness of the word all that the Old Testament was now he stands what is he he's the last Adam he's a restored he's he's a Son of God to bring the restoration but what does God do in restoring the Masterpiece when he when he finally proved that he was the perfect son when he was tested in every way amen when he was found without spot or blemish now he became a tested lamb the Lambs that come to pass over weren't just any lamb they had to be a perfect lamb and they had to go through the testing amen by the priest now Christ comes through the testing period and proved that he would not forsake one word and now as as the perfect sacrifice amen he comes and he sheds his blood which is his created blood of God and that shed blood becomes the price of redemption to buy back and at Calvary amen he takes from his side blood and water the elements where which you'll build now his spiritual bride what's he doing he's restoring what was falling in Eden he's bringing back the Masterpiece and now for 2000 years he's been building a bride to do what to bring back a union to do what to bring on a millennium and what is the Millennium the seventh day the first time God took his rest and gave his creation to a son and his son's wife amen his rest was interrupted by the Fall amen but now amen he's come himself in flesh as Jesus Christ amen and he's created a bride and United the two together so that God can finish the seven thousandth year the one thousand year period the seventh day that was interrupted before and now when God rests what's happening in his rest in the Millennium now he turns back all of creation back to the son of David who will sit on the throne of David which is Jesus Christ and his bride the seventh is completion so the seventh seal is completion so the prophet of God says in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed he says all of God's Sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 see to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again to the place of where you should have been at the beginning we were all born wrong because of the serpent seed because of the fall in the garden it corrupted humanity and we we all came but we didn't come the way we were originally intended to come and so now we've come with corruption but when we're born of the water and the spirit that's why we have to be born again even the term born again points right to serpency right to the fall amen because our first birth Us in corruption amen but our second birth versus incorruptible by The Incorruptible seed so now we have to be born again because of what happened Amen in that when we're born of the water spirit what does it do it brings us right back into the place where we should have been in the beginning why because of the price of redemption he paid the price that's the reason Christ's death brings us right back again to where sons of God that's what we were supposed to be now he says if Eve would have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not God tell her multiply and replenish the Earth but she had to walk over here and play the part of a what did God want God he set forth his son and his son's bride and why was Adam given a bride to reproduce himself what would it be to reproduce himself to reproduce another Son of God a son of God male out of him comes female United back together they're still the same thing to do what to reproduce another Son of God and reproduce another Son of God and another Son of God and another Son of God and then this is just my personal belief based off the message amen if there had been no fall I would have come forth that way I don't understand the mechanics of it I'm not going to talk about the mechanics but I would have come forth that way the original way without corruption and been on this Earth that was God's original intent but now I've come forth in corruption because of perversion because of leaving the word because of the fall and now I have to be redeemed back there have to be a price paid for me and then I by faith amen have to connect back to the price that was paid for me and I have to be born again which means to see Gene have gone inside of me must be quickened by the spirit of God and come to life to unite me back to what I originally should have been and then that revelation will bring changes in my life and bring me into the image of Christ and will bring me back to the place I should have been because it will eventually change this body and we'll have a glorified body like unto his and to reconnect me with my theophany which I should have had from the beginning so now we find that God is restoring and don't forget we're we're still talking about the seven seal we're talking about the seven seal brings him to Earth and the message Satan's Eden Prophet God says so God knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so we would be contacted in order he could contact he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ the son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes and fellowship so what was God's purpose to display his attributes and fellowship when I was in my father I knew nothing about it but when I became his son and was born of him I was an attribute a part of my father and you're a part of your father as and as children of God we are part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning what did God want he wanted Fellowship of his attributes of himself Amen to become Sons and Daughters of God to have Fellowship together with him and one another upon the Earth that's why he created this Earth that's why he placed his son and daughter here and that's why he told him to multiply and replenish that was what he wanted in the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning he had everything under control and he turned man over in the Garden of Eden on free moral agencies say son it's yours what a beautiful place God Was So Satisfied until he just went back and rested from all his works every tree never brought forth Thorns with thistles no berries ever come off of a Thorn Tree everything was perfect all seeds were perfect everything was in perfect condition then when he went to take a little rest his enemy slipped in with the seat and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children how did how did Satan ruin the program by misinterpreting the word of God he he mistranslated misinterpreted misrepresented what God Said and twisted what God Said and enticed even by her own lust she was led away amen and caused the fall and ruined nation and now for six thousand years he's built building his own Eden Satan's in which is about come to perfection and so we see now coming to this seventh seal seven is the number of completion so in six days God made all that he had made and he established it as perfect and and and gave them Dominion on the seventh day he turned it over to them and he rested signifying a complete work the Masterpiece is done now that wasn't the end of the Masterpiece because the Masterpiece was going to multiply that was the intention to become a family upon the Earth but he had done everything he needed to do his work was completed now they were commissioned to continue on and multiply and replace and if they would have stayed behind the word it would have been perfect but they left the word and we know that that serves a purpose because in the fall we learned so much about God we learned about Redemption we learn about salvation healing and all of these things so God is expressing himself even through the the fall but we see here that in the seventh seal brother Brandon makes this statement here in the seventh seal he said we must remember that this seventh seal was the end of time of all things that's right the things written in the seven seal book seal up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation of the world it every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world is the end of struggling nature it is the end of everything and there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the Earth It's The End even of the end time it's even the end of time sorry time runs out the Bible said so uh Revelation chapter 10 1 to 7th verse runs out the angel said time shall be no more in the days of this great thing to happen everything runs out in this time the end of at the end of this seventh seal so the seventh seal is the completion of whatever was sealed in this book under these seals the seventh is coming to the completion and it's the completion of redemption and the completion of redemption is what well what is being redeemed redeemed means to buy back and bring into its proper place or to its former State what was being redeemed being redeemed back to what God originally looked at and said it's very good and went and rested so everything is redeeming back to this place Amen in the seventh seal amen the seventh seal brings everything back to this place it ends time it ends the time for this and the time for that everything just ends up on the seventh seal and we come right back into the full masterpiece and because of that I wouldn't say the seventh seal is one thing and I might say that wrong I don't even know what language to use but if I take the seven seal and just make the seven seal one pin prick event and the timeline the seventh seal is the end of the Trump is the end of the vial the end of the ushering into the Millennium it's the end of all time which we know time runs out on the seventh seal but time doesn't run out to the end of the millennium which is the end of the seventh day and then we step into new heavens and new earth and into eternity where there is no more time so so the seventh seal encompasses the completion and the completion is a process here's how brother Branham says it notice it's the end of the church age it's the end of the Seven Seals it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it even ends the ushering end of the Millennium that's on the seventh seal so you see there's a lot of things included in the seventh seal it's just like firing a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes here and it goes up then it explodes again it puts out five stars one of those Stars explodes and blows out five stars from it and then one of them Stars explodes blows out five stars from it see it fades out that's what the seventh seal it just ends the time for the world it ends the time for this it means the time for that it ends the time for this it's it ends the time everything just ended up on the seventh seal why because it's the completion of redemption it's the finishing of the work of redemption It's the final seal it's completion and everything finishes it's the brother remember calls it the end time seal it's the seal under which reveals the mystery of God and then brother Branham comes along and preaches Christ is the mystery of God revealed he couldn't preach that until the opening of the seventh seal because the seventh seal will reveal the mystery of God and Christ is the mystery of God revealed so if you want to see the Revelation or the revealing of the mystery of God from Revelation 10 7 then you must see Christ because Christ is the mystery of God revealed and Christ is revealed under the seventh seal that's why this whole Bible is the seventh seal because this is the revelation of Jesus Christ this is the mystery of God being unfolded through through time how's it unfolded through people we go back and read the Bible the Bible is a record of people it's people from the beginning to the end and when one person Fades off the scene another comes on the scene and we follow their life and they fade off another comes on the scene they fade off another what is this the brother Benham said the Bible is the written record of the son of God Jesus Christ is the word is the word of God is is the word made manifest and here we have the word of God the record of the Son of God but he also called this a book of redemption he also called it a marriage certificate he also called it the title deed he also called the written record of the Son of God he also called it God in written form and what is it it's it is records of lives so the mystery of God must have something to do with Christ and Christ must have something to do with people amen oh God is amazing in the message shalom it says we heard the word say that in the days of the seventh angel and the church age he just said the seventh Angel's message would be the last message and then oh we find out over here in Revelation 10 and the days of the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of God should be finished the seventh seal would be pulled back it should be there then all at once when it happened a vision broke said go to Tucson a great noise will take place at this time so you'll thoroughly understand and know that it's sin it'll just shake the Earth nearly all of you know about it it's on tape months before it happened then it happened then appeared in the sky Shalom what is it it's the changing beats the sympathy or the symphony he's talking about we know Revelation 10 in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound well we all know clearly that William Branham was the seventh angel and when he began to sound he said not when he went on his healing campaigns but we begin to sound out his ministry amen the message that God had given him which was the seventh seal he was the messenger of the seven seal that was his message and he said the seventh seal will be pulled back at that time and be pulled back and then when it happened a vision broke forth we're talking about the pulling back of the seventh seal the opening of the seventh seal a vision caught him out to Tucson amen where he could contact in that constellation of angels which come in the form of a a cloud a white pyramid and brothers the pyramid which is the Capstone the finishing off of the New Testament Church amen but later when the angel told him to turn it to the right he turned it to the right and he saw that it was the head of Jesus Christ the headship coming to the body the full word amen the mind of Christ now coming down to connect with his bride on Earth Amen to form one being the marriage amen the union of Christ and his bride amen was taking place under what under the pulling back of the seventh seal had to bring back to a marriage because in the beginning that's where it went so we got to bring it back to that Union and in that he turned the picture to the right and he saw him and what was it he said it was angel's wings and they make up a cloud and it looked like a cloud and the cloud was made by angel's wings and they were the seven the the seven angels to the seven Church ages representing the completion of the church ages and at the completion of the church ages the fullness of that was Christ amen we saw it prefigured in Revelation chapter one and now the fullness is coming to the body and he was clothed with a cloud like Revelation 10 1. the mighty angel coming down clothed with a cloud in his face shine like the sun and his feet as pillars of Fire what is it it's Christ the anointed word of Christ the anointed one Christ Jesus Christ coming to his body what under the seventh seal because it's the ending of the church ages that ends under the seventh seal in the ending of the church ages brought completion and completion would bring a bride to connection with her bridegroom praise God and what was that what was that cloud in the sky he said that was shalom peace good morning changing of the Rhythm changing of the beat reading the sheet music now we've been through church ages Church ages Church ages but all of a sudden this marks a change in the symphony now it's time to play the next part and the next part amen is not the part of building a bride body the next part is the part of the marriage Union and that's the part we're living in the union the invisible Union of Christ and his bride the marriage is taking place now the union is taking place now that's the part we're playing not the church Ages part but this part what under the seventh seal and the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seven seal was opened there was silence I love this message of Christ is the mystery of God revealed like I said he couldn't preach it to the opening of the seventh seal but he's tying it together with the great mystery that even Jesus wouldn't reveal to his disciples and that's the mystery of his coming so there's a mystery of his coming that he wouldn't reveal to the disciples amen but now uh brother attaches that to the seventh seal that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven Thunders out of their voices and John was forbidden to write see the coming of the Lord this is what brother Brown says Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour is the same reason the seven Thunders uttered and John was told not to write see the coming of the Lord it's all connected to the seventh seal which is the coming of the Lord which is the ending of everything because it's now completion which is attached to the seventh seal which is attached to the silence in heaven for half an hour which is attached to the seven Thunders which is attached to the the message of the seventh angel which is the mystery of God being revealed all of these things are the same thing and John was even from bitten to write it see the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't it's a good thing that he doesn't know that's good he says it's a good thing that he doesn't he hasn't revealed yet it's a good thing that he doesn't next line he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible amen this seventh seal won't be broke to the public but it doesn't mean it won't be broke to his bride amen he hasn't declared it he hasn't openly stated but he has showed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the mystery of God Christ is the mystery of God the entire Bible is the revelation of the seventh seal oh praise God the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it in God's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it so the seventh seal no he he hasn't told it but I hope you get it tonight I I hope you get it this morning he said I hope you get it amen because he's revealed it in every time and with God's help I hope you see it this morning what is this Christ is the mystery of God revealed this is the great mystery what God has had in his mind all along there's been a mystery of God Amen a mystery that he's held within himself that he has not revealed and he's sown seeds of it and and all of these things we can see he's displayed it in every time amen as this record of people come forward it's amazing the the the it's amazing the types and the shadows and all the things that he's expressing through the lives of his children all foreshadowing foreshadowing foreshadowing even all the way back in Eden he was foreshadowing what he had done amen was a snapshot a picture of what he wanted to achieve and then he allowed that snapshot to fall into ruin amen so that he could build it back so that he could fully Express his full nature as Redeemer and healer and savior because with no fall he's not a redeemer with no fault I mean he is a redeemer but he's not expressed as a redeemer He Is A Healer but without the fall he's not expressed as a Healer so now he expresses himself but in the end the culmination when the mystery of God is finished when he's done expressing himself and he's putting his attributes upon the Earth then under the seventh seal he'll finish the expression collect it all back together return it back to an Eden condition the Millennium he'll finish his Seventh-Day rest that was interrupted amen and let the Son of God Amen on the throne of David with his wife rule the Earth amen rule all of creation to complete the seventh day and then time will run out under the seventh seal and after time runs out then he'll Purge the Earth completely with Holy Fire and bring down new heaven bring down New Jerusalem into new heavens and a new Earth and then he will be himself a family upon the Earth the attributes of God Express fellowshipping together on a perfect Earth which is what he wanted from the beginning the mystery that he's held in his mind what he wanted to achieve was this fellowship with attribute to it understand him in all of his expression that would know him as a father would know him as the Holy Ghost would know him as a comforter would know him as a Healer would know him as a husband would know him in all of these attributes he would be fully known and then now in this great eternity God in his attributes his children would would have Fellowship together when Harmony and understanding in unity because of the mystery of redemption and this mystery was laying in the whole Bible but sealed under these Seven Seals and the seventh seal is The Silent One it's the it's the culmination it's the finishing it's the end time it's the finishing of time time Runs Out for denominational system times ran out on ages times run out why because he's bringing everything and Redemption to the end he brings the Gentile disposition to the end he restores the Jews as a nation amen he brings back a son and a dog a son and a son's wife to rule on the earth for a thousand years to complete the the rest then he purges it completely purges the Earth again completely and brings back Harmony and unity and Perfection upon the Earth what is the seven seal the completion of all things then we move into the eighth which is not eight it's one it's back to the beginning after seven you go back to what it was in its original intent in an original desire and this seventh seal these seals contain the mystery of redemption and the seventh seal contains the mystery of God which was the secret that he had in his mind and what he wanted to accomplish all along and now has been revealed to those who can receive it is it broke to the public no because only the elect can receive this revelation listen we can find people who can agree with it but that's not the same thing only elect can receive it it's not agreement but it's by faith it's a revelation he goes on to say what shall I do with this Jesus called Christ and this message at the end of 1963 says and who would dare to say that wasn't the inspired word of God when he foretold it here and sent it out yondered to Arizona and brought it right back even with science and everything else and proved it so the book is already opened the book is already open that's right just waiting for the seven seal to be identified of the coming of Christ it's already opened amen that's what the opening of the seals was about the book is open now he's waiting for the seventh seal to I to be identified of the coming of Christ he he wants the people to catch what it is it's got to be identified at the coming of Christ and that's what I want to talk about now now I'm going to get to this quote where we extracted our title out of the message Souls that are in prison now and in this message souls are in prison now brother Branham is struggling within himself you can hear him through the entire duration of the message because he knows that the lamb took the book he knows that the seals are open he knows it it's not a doubt in his mind and what he's dealing with in souls in prison now he's dealing with the implications of that truth he's saying is the third pool like when Jesus went down to the souls that were in prison and preached to them amen they were lost there was no hope for Redemption but he went and told them I'm the one Noah spoke of I'm the one Abraham was declaring to you and you've rejected it and now you're doomed amen and brothers is questioning is that what we're doing now now that the Seven Seals have been open they meant now that the lamb has taken the book is there no more Mercy is there no more amen is there no more Mercy because is it all over is everything sealed to sealed and it's all over and nobody else can be saved this is what he's struggling with this is what he's preaching in souls are in prison now why is he struggling he's struggling because he knows the lamb took the book if he doesn't know the lamb took the book and opened all Seven Seals there's nothing to struggle about the struggle shows the faith of the Prophet that he knows that the lamb has taken the book and opened the seals and now he's wondering if the third pool is a Ministry to the totally lost and he says not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by joining church not by the fruit of the spirit Christian Science can outsmother any of you on that see and deny even Jesus Christ was divine not that but it's the word living there it is if they had only looked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or a woman lives that word lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written Epistles read of all men is that right could the third pull be on tape people that's listening to the tape I wish you could look at this congregation at this time I hope you're feeling the same way what if it is look at the scriptures piling in here brother I'm showing so many scriptures this shows it's the end It's The End could it be is the third pool to preach to the Eternal Doom that's rejected the message of salvation will you say the church is going yeah they will they'll go right on just the same but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member has been redeemed The Sixth Seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat and claimed that he owned and what he had redeemed that's right it's always been that third pool three is perfection the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot now I'm going to break this down a little bit brother man I'm saying are we here are we at the end of everything is it all over and there's no more home and I believe later he begins to show amen that there still is Mercy but Mercy is found only in Christ and Christ is the word that was revealed Mercy is no more found in systems and denominations and church systems and in church ages amen but now it is found in Christ because Christ the message is the ark amen and remember Before Destruction set in Noah was already sealed in the ark amen and the bride is sealed in Christ before the destruction Falls amen the sixth steel has produced itself amen the six seal is already opened amen the six brothers showed that the 60 opened the same time the six by was poured out and tied it to they were tied it to World War II in the releasing of the demons out of the river Euphrates amen but showing that was an amateur form that it's going to come to its fullness later and the Great Tribulation period but it's already opened and he says the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book then he says the ministry come to its Perfection when he's speaking of his own Ministry now the ministry of Christ in him the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was redicted as it was in the days of lot the third poll on brother benham's Ministry amen when he was a son of man revealing this when the ministry come to Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in the natural amongst human beings and the seventh seal brings him back to Earth it's amazing how we can make a statement like that the seven seal brings him back to Earth and immediately through thousands of years of denominational teaching we automatically picture Jesus in flesh with nail prints coming and standing upon the Earth immediately our minds will go there's so much imagery from from books and from denominational teaching and all of that comes and we believe that's coming but that won't come until the Millennium till he comes the son of David his feet won't touch the Earth and this Gentile dispensation we'll meet him in the air so the coming of the Lord is not Jesus coming and standing on the earth and the flesh body that was crucified but the Gentile form the coming of the Lord will still come and he's coming to take his bride away and we'll we'll be translated and meet that body in the air but he's coming to lead us back home he's come to take us there how did he come he come as the mighty angel it didn't say his flesh Revelation 10 1 didn't say especially come as the mighty Angel The Covenant angel the angel of the Covenant descended with an open book in his hand and when he descended with an open book in his hands seven Thunders uttered their voices and that's what happened in the preaching of the seals and so now he says the ministry come to Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of law he goes on to say in the message crisis the mystery of God revealed he says and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and as the days of lot when a modern Billy Graham Oral Roberts went down into Sodom and preached to the sodomites and blinded their eyes see with the gospel and the angel stayed back a messenger with Abraham in the elected group and what kind of sign did he do see what did Abraham call him Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus showing that he himself God in him will be manifested in his bride in the last days so let's go to Genesis chapter 18. let's just look at this in Genesis chapter 18. brother Branham is showing that the sign of the end time is what Jesus says but as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot so he goes to show us what's going on in the days of Noah and in the days of Law and in the days of lot it was in the world was in a Sodom condition and in in the days of lot amen there also was one who came and visited Abraham in the days of lot and brother Branham starts to show that there was three that came amen one Abraham called Lord but the other two angels went down into Sodom and he and he he actually tells you who they were it was Billy Graham and Oral Roberts so brother Ren was not pointing this to the Future this is past he's preaching in his present tense truth he said Elohim God was manifested in his flesh Jesus showing that he himself gone in and would be manifest in his bride in the last days and we look at this in in Genesis 18 verse 1. and the Lord appeared unto him in the planes of memory this is Jehovah a self-existing one who reveals himself and the Lord appeared unto him in the planes of memory and he sat in the tent and Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and loathe three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground he said my Lord if if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant that a little water I pray thee be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree so Abraham comes and calls him my Lord and then we go down to when when this Angel begins to speak now we know that that he eats the calf he drinks the milk he eats the butter he's in flesh but this is Jehovah according to the word but he's in flesh and he's eating so it's Jehovah and flesh and then he begins to speak and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door and the tent door which was behind him so well where was Sarah in the tent door and where was the tent door behind him so he had his back this Jehovah that was in flesh with dust on his clothes eating behind him was Sarah he says now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being also old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have Surety bear a child which him own is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did laugh we see brother Ben refers back to this over and over again and and his reference to this he's trying to get us to see the day we're living in he he will so much so that at the end of his service he will turn his back to the audience and begin to call out people and he'll reference this he'll explain this story and say she was in the tent or behind him and he knew the thoughts of her heart and he declared them amen when when when when when she was in the tent behind him and brother man will turn his back to the congregation begin to call people you in the balcony you were there with a red dress and the yellow and this and that and it would be exactly what he said and what's he trying to show he's trying to show amen that this is the ministry of Christ recreated in flesh Christ in flesh again a man with dust on his clothes who can eat amen could eat enough flesh but it was God in that flesh amen the flesh wasn't God it was God In the Flesh and here brother Branham is a flesh man but he's a son of man revealing this on a man the son of man is Jesus Christ himself and he was working brother Branham as a human being could no more know who was behind him and what their ailment wasn't what their name was that wasn't the man that was Jesus Christ working through that flesh which takes us right back to Genesis 18. because at the time there's a man doing that to the Royal seed that predestinated there's two other Angels going and smiting blind Sodom and he says preaching the gospel smites them blind because they get a dose of the Gospel but they don't get the true Revelation and they're blinded amen yep so this has happened yeah yeah this has already happened this is where we are let's look at the prophecy in Luke chapter 17. Luke chapter 17. Luke 17 verse 26. and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given and married until the day that Noah entered the Ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed what was the ministry of William Branham it was the revealing of the son of man it was revealing that Jesus Christ was present he knew your name your ailment where you came from what you were struggling with and he was there to deliver so in the days of lot that was the Sodom you see what happened in the days of lot we've seen it repeat in this generation and there was a prophet on the scene to say this is that and this is that and this is that so here we are but when we look at this now actually I want to look at one more Matthew 24 let's go to Matthew 24. because brother Ram ties these two statements together to the same prophecy they're just worded slightly different in two different places Matthew 24 36. it says but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only stop right there brother random referred to this when we read crisis mystery God reveal Nobody Knows the day or hour of Us coming that's the question and Jesus answered and said but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only he said nobody knows the day or hour only my father but look at what he says next but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be he said nobody knows the day of our but but if you have spiritual ears ears to hear it'll be like it was in the days of Noah it'll be like it was in the days of lot when you see the days of knowing you see the days of lot repeating hey we're here no man knows a day of our but I'll give you a clue I can't give you the whole thing I can't declare it openly it must still be a mystery but I'll give you a clue this is exactly what the prophet did when he came to Christ the mystery of God revealed he said nobody knows that god holds this mystery only to himself amen it's a good thing he doesn't know but he has revealed it and showed it in every type that's in the Bible if you'll pay attention like it was in the days of Noah like it was in Sodom like it was in the days of lot what's he doing brother bantam's coming and preaching exactly the way Jesus is preaching concerning this question because he was a word Prophet because it was Christ in him it was a Ministry of Jesus Christ not a Ministry of a man and he's repeating the same thing and nobody knows a day or hour it's glad he he's not revealed it's not open to the public it's not any of that but it's laying open in every type that's in the Bible amen and I hope with God's help you'll see it here this morning but as it was in the day of Noah so shall also the coming of the son of man be not just the revealing but the revealing and the coming are together for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking Mary and giving and marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be so now we see that we see the indications of the time of his coming and you know when Noah went into the ark he was sealed into the ark before the destruction came and the bride is sealed into Christ Before Destruction came and this message is Christ it's the word it's the revealed word of God which is Christ and this message is our Ark and we are sealed into Christ by the word sealed into Christ come into an invisible Union as a bridegroom and bride sealed into him before the destruction comes and everybody else for those days that Noah was sealed in the ark they continued to marry and give in marriage and buy and build and sell and have church services and alter calls and everything else they were doing but Noah was already sealed in the ark and the bride is now sealed in Christ and all around this Ark the same things are going on praise God it's repeating so what's interesting to me is now in this Genesis 18. what was Elohim coming for Elohim was coming down it was God coming down to reveal himself through flesh and and to give an indication that it was God and to show when we would recognize when he come again amen he would have his back turned to Sarah and he would discern the thoughts of her heart giving us a key indication so we would recognize here we are again at the same time two are going down to solve them and so at that time why did Elohim come what was the purpose of Elohim coming Elohim was coming down to confirm a promise he had made he was coming on the scene to confirm a promise and in that promise is that Abraham would have a son and that that son would come through Sarah and Sarah was part of Abraham and so he came down to culminate finish complete the promise he came down for the seventh seal he came down to initiate the end time which would be the end of this prophecy the End of This Promise the end that you shall have a son and by Sarah you shall have a son he came down Amen to finish the prophecy he came down to complete the prophecy he came down in the mystery of the seventh seal and in that mystery he would speak and in speaking he would restore back Abraham's seed he reached over back what the word do the elect and he would restore back the womb so that the word could come to the womb what happened in this end time ministry of the seventh angel amen the son of man returned amen it was the recumbing of the son of man Jesus Christ himself was here to finish the promise that he had made amen and that promise was he was going to restore all that was lost and he came down and in coming down He restored the word amen and brother bam says the word had been laying as if it was dead been laying amen but now has been resurrected how is it resurrected because the chains were taken off the denominational misunderstandings the ideas of men were ruined it was holding it back the Holy Ghost had been bound for nearly 2 000 years man but it's been loosed in the evening time the Holy Ghost back on the people so now brought back the word to full expression the full Revelation and restored a womb a bride to receive that word to do what to produce the promise of the age which was a son the promised son to come into manifestation that's what all this happened for that's why he came down he came down to fulfill his promise he came down to speak the word he came down to reposition everything so that the seed remember in Abraham it was dried up to restore the seed to restore the womb so the seed could come to the womb to reproduce the Sun why did the ministry of William Branham come for the same reason and the message proving his word 1964 it's August of 64. he says now we say he's raised from the dead I didn't say it the word here said it he raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last day that the same son of man will be made manifest now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts and Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty showing and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed so at the coming of the son of man is when the son of man is revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride so what did he come for what was the purpose of the coming of the son of man and why was he demonstrating himself through a son of man the purpose was to unite the body and the head together as a unit in an invisible Union brother man said that God showed him that his ministry was Eliezer fetching a bride for Isaac and Eliezer brought the bride all the way to Isaac praise God amen so the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together have we seen it did the son of man come down through human flesh and show the sign of the Messiah knowing the thoughts and intents of the heart amen to do what to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergy man I don't know I do you see what I mean it's not a man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper so where are we at in the timeline amen the son of man has been revealed in flesh amen we've we've had we've had a replay of Genesis 18 and he's come down and spoke the promise now is the season for fulfillment now the seventh seal is in full motion now is the time of restoration back the church is coming back to its original condition the words coming back to its original revelation to unite together to bring forth what the revelation of Jesus Christ The Promised son [Music] now where are we at we're in the uniting time and when she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage the marriage is taking place now he quotes a scripture he says fill your self on the Flesh of Mighty Men because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and day two become one and then what does it do then the whole point was was to to bring back Jesus Christ to bring back the word that had been separated from the People by denominationalism and in bringing back the full measure of the word bringing back Christ Christ showed himself present amen and He restored a bride back to what she should have been in her original condition at the day of Pentecost before the fall before denomination before creeds to do what to unite to do two together to become one and then what does it do in this Union in this Union the invisible Union then what does this Union do it manifests the son of man again it wasn't left just in William Branham but now Christ is to be revealed through his body after the union has taken place it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing what did this great scene in the plans of memory that's repeated in our day what was it for why have we seen the days of lot the days of Noah what is the son of man come for he's come down to fetch a bride he's come down to claim what he's redeemed which is his bride and in claiming her he possesses her and he takes her unto himself the union the marriage is now to do what to reproduce his life again Adam was given a bride to reproduce himself Christ has given a bride to do the same thing but before he could come to her to reproduce himself she was already fallen in the first church age and she stayed Fallen but he was working his Plan of Redemption to bring a bride back to her virgin condition Virgin by the word it took a perfect virgin word restored to bring the virginity back to the bride washed away from man's Creeds man's ideas but a pure word restored to bring her back to her virgin condition to do what to unite the word in her as one to do what to reproduce the son of man again through where through her through where I'll say it this way through me this is where the Revelation is coming to where is this Revelation coming to why did God let me see the manifestation of the son of man others saw it and called it beelzebug others saw it and walked away others saw and said this false prophecy but why in my heart I knew it was true amen because he came to me he only this only came to the Royal Seed of Abraham amen the other Messengers went to the rest of the denominational systems but this messenger which was Jehovah himself which is Jesus Christ the son of man in a body of Flesh he only came to speak something to the elect why did God let me stay when others walked away God why did God give me a heart to believe and to perceive what he was saying when others called it confusion and left why because the message is for me the message that came through that manifestation was for me and he says I will restore your time of life I will bring you back Amen to a virgin condition to youthfulness as a bride to where you can receive the seed and bring forth life again that's why I heard it because I was predestinated to hear it I was always part of that Royal Sea and now I have been predestinated like Sarah was predestinated Sarah thought she's too old she thought I can't do it I can't produce a wound so she came up with another plan and started the whole system of churches by using intellect and reasoning and saying take haggar amen haggar will bring up a child for me this is reasonable it's lawful it makes sense and she started the whole denominational thing but that failed and was separated out amen and she had to come to the realization it's not anybody else this is going to happen through me amen I'm the one I'm promised why because she was the one who was part of Abraham Hagar wasn't part of Abraham wasn't his law for why but she and Abraham were one flesh she was Mrs Abraham and so the promise was for Abraham out of your loins from you amen and Hagar wasn't Abraham but Sarah was Sarah was Abraham in female form so now the promise had to come through Abraham so it could only come through Sarah so Sarah had to be restored to produce the Sun why do we hear this message because this message is the revelation of the seventh seal to you to unlock the mystery of God so that you would know it's not a mystery anymore to the bride it's a secret it's not a mystery it's a mystery to the world it's a secret to the bride because God has revealed what was in the his secret the back part of his mind and he's whispered love secrets to his wife why so that she could have faith why Hebrews 11 said let's go to Hebrews 11. Hebrews 11. I love this word friend the message came to bring an identification so we wouldn't be stuck in this confusion not knowing who we are or where truth was it came to establish us why because if we don't have faith we cannot be who we were called to be and God wants a manifestation in this hour and to have that manifestation he needs your body so God had to bring something that would lift your faith out of the carnal into the supernatural where all things are possible so that he could use your body to finish his work so God had to bring a revelation in the hour that would lift us up out of laodicea Lift us up out of carnal so that we could see who we really were when the back part of God's mind where we were in Residence before we came here now remember Sarah was turned back Young but remember that she woke up in the morning and they were shocked looked in the mirror she screamed he dramatizes they returned back young amen then there's a little trouble in the land they go down to qurar and a baby like the king of garage he wants to take her at 80 years old and make her his his wife because she's a beautiful virgin the scripture is giving us an indication Something's Happened to this woman why does the king of Gerard who could have any virgin he wants one an 80 year old woman because she had been turned back Young but just because she was brought back to Virgin condition did not mean she would conceive seed because in her original virgin condition she could not conceive seed she had been married for years but I said possibly since she was 16 years of age amen and she had never conceived she needed something more than just be brought back to Virgin condition she needed to conceive seed and all the time through Genesis Genesis we have God coming to Abraham God speaking Abraham God coming to Abraham God coming to Abraham God coming to Abraham but then God says I will visit you according to the time of life I will visit you he says I will visit you according to the time of life and that visitation shows up later in Genesis and in Genesis he says and the Lord visited Sarah this time it wasn't Abraham it was it was Abe it was Mrs Abraham because that's who needed the visitation for this manifestation but he told Abraham I'll visit you because she was part of Abraham she was Abraham she was the part that was going to bring forth the promised son that came out of Abraham so he says I will visit you in that visitation is the seventh seal it's the secret because we don't know the conversation we don't know what the Lord said we don't know anything it just says he visited Sarah and Sarah conceived that's the hour we're living in that's what's happening to you and I and the Mystery of the seventh seal and the silent in the little room in the place where nobody can explain what's going on Amen he's visiting you who are you part of Christ part of the word he's visiting the part of the word that now has to manifest the word in this generation and he's visiting you in the privacy of your heart where you can't even copy you can't even copy somebody else's visitation because there's no example given the Bible doesn't say what happened to Sarah just said the Lord visited her and we see the results she conceives and brings forth to child in the 10th Vision when they went into the little room they came out the other end changed still restored whole but they couldn't explain what happened you could just see the results of what happened and so now God he said the third pull it'll be a secret because there's not going to be any imitation of this there won't be an imitation all there will be as a result a manifestation but not an imitation God will visit you in the privacy of your heart where under the seven still under the end time under the Fulfillment of the promise under the completion of the Gentile dispensation now over here in Hebrews 11 . let's go to verse 8. by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he so adjourn in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in the Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker was gone through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed it wasn't just that she was turned back Young she was turned back young before she conceived but at the visitation of God when he said I will visit you and he visited Sarah it gave her faith through faith Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed the seed was good the restored seed when Abraham was restored to youth the seed was good the word that we've been given is good the church has been brought back to a virgin condition brought back to the word but something else must happen in a private visitation to Sarah to you the bride you must have a visitation of Christ in your heart that gives you Faith to conceive the seed seed's good the restoration is good but we must have a personal visitation where this mystery is revealed to us and we receive strength by what by faith we receive strength to conceive and so this word can reproduce the son of man again in Galatians 4 19 I'll just read it to you Paul the Apostle says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you what was Paul wanting for the church he wanted Christ to be formed in you that's why he espoused them only to one and and he was nervous over them but he espoused them as a Chase virgin even one even to Christ why because he wanted Christ to be formed in them he knew it would take a virgin womb and now Christ would be formed in them and then now he's he's laboring to try to bring forth the manifestation of Christ in them that's the day we live here and the message things that are to be the prophet says now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living what's the hour the expression of the son of man of the word through the bride that's the expression I want you to do she's reproduce the son of man again amen when brother Bram comes to crisis mystery God revealed he starts with the scriptures out of Colossians 1 and quite familiar we know them but I'm just going to recite this one to you he said wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery would have been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory it can't stop with brother Branham that that manifestation had to take place before I could ever come into my manifestation without it we're nowhere without the seventh angel we're nowhere we're lost in the scripture somewhere with no Mark no placing without a son of man revealing the son of man amen we don't know who's here in this hour we don't know what the hour is we don't know the manifestation we haven't had declared to us the days of law we don't understand but through that Ministry it declared to us the hour in the season and day and who's present and what's to be accomplished and then when we see Eliezer fetch a bride for Isaac once Isaac and Eliezer or Isaac and Rebecca are connected eliezer's work is complete [Music] brother Ben says in God's provided place of worship from 1965 but he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man come down in human form three of them two angels and God himself that was God the Bible said it was now he come down and he manifests himself there by turning his back to the tent where Sarah was and told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the temp that's right now Jesus himself said at the day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ himself that way we don't have any mistake on what the son of man is the ministry of Jesus Christ himself the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism the holy ghost or the Pentecostals and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man so we go through justification sanctification the baptism that goes into the Perfection of the son of man we don't stop at the baptism in the Holy Ghost that's to bring us to the person of the Holy Ghost himself and to the Perfection of the son of man and what is the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self person when the two become one and began to manifest itself why was Adam given a bride to reproduce himself why is Christ given a bride to reproduce himself God will be so manifested in his into his bride his church until they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at I love that last statement he preaches in April of 1965. he says now you see where we're at the seals have been opened the seven seal has been opened the son of man has come the Lord Has Come and revealed himself through a son of man to do what to to unite The Head and the body together so that she can manifest the son of man said now you see where we're at I hope we see where we're at this is where we're at but if this is where we're at amen what kind of people do we need to be and what kind of Revelation do we need to have amen let's turn to Ephesians chapter four together Ephesians chapter 4. we'll read from verse 10. he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that they might fill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but see beeking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ you can see here I want to look at the the work of the ministry and God uses a faithful Ministry but the faithful Ministry is the work of Christ and to do what to bring us into the unity of Faith verse 13 in the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ what's the point of the ministry brother random said the ministry in his third pull the ministry come Perfection when it reproduced Christ and natural again amongst the bride what will be the completion of the Perfection of the ministry even through the faithful Ministry the ministry of Christ is to bring the church the bride the people into a perfect man into the stature of the fullness of Christ until we can look back at the culmination and see the pre-figure the pre-figure from Revelation chapter one when we see one like the son of man until this bride becomes one like the son of man till she is in his very image she is in his very likeness she has this very character displaying his very life brother bear says in the message desperations he said how is it then how is it that we can see other great signs and wonders done on others and what about us it should cause an estate of desperation that we are determined before God the signs of his coming should bring this entire congregation when we've read it from the word and the Holy Spirit has told us go at a certain place such and such a thing will happen not tell us what it was but it would happen we go there it happens that way the newspapers packet the magazines packet show the picture of it he's talking about Tucson he's talking about getting caught up in the consolation of angels and the and the picture of Christ in the sky the Clown he said the newspapers back at the magazines packet showed a picture of it come back here and see those great Mysteries hidden in the Bible opened up to us on a new field that we never knowed before and perfectly Blends into the coming of the Lord Jesus then at the end of the messages see the action of the great Holy Spirit see him come down visible before people even take pictures of it see it working and showing that it's not a man it's not just a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing he did when he was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ now it's in body in the body of his bride what was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ is now to be embodied in the body of his bride and brother Ben said it should throw us into desperation this is the part that I I want to end on if this is true if everything we've seen is true if we've seen a repeat of the days of Sodom and we've seen a visitation of Jehovah amen like on the plains of memory if we've seen the sign of the Messiah and the discernment behind if we've seen the ministry of Eleazar if we've seen all this then what does that mean for me as an individual we we can say we can use group statements and group statements are nice and comforting the bride is this and she's that and she's this but the Revelation must move away from group statements and become individual come to the place where I say have I had a visitation like Sarah God do get has he given me by faith strength to conceive the seed not as a church receives of course it's come to the church that's the dispensation where this has been restored the bride has been restored the word has been restored she's been given faith for strength to conceive but what about me as an individual have I got that visitation from him has he visited me and given me Faith to receive seed and conceive seed man and then what kind of Life am I supposed to produce [Music] what has the if I do I believe that the manifestation of the son of man in my day was to do what to unite The Head and the body I'm part of the body and the whole purpose of the ministry was brother better was to get me connected to Christ bring it personal and if that Ministry was meant to get me connected to Christ so I take the headship of the word amen and then I and then then what is it to do then then reproduce the son of man then that means all the preaching and all the teaching and all the faithful Ministry and the ministry of it was all to do one thing to bring me into the stature of a perfect man into the fullness of Christ so that now he can live through me so that I can manifest the Sun I myself want to be given to Christ so that he can reproduce himself me in my life can I do it all no it's not all for me to do but I want to do my portion I want to be true to the message true to the hour not by mental acceptance I can say amen amen amen no it can't be just Amen in the mouth it must be Amen in the life amen the life is the amen the life the consecration the reality the lining up to the word The Obedience to surrender all of that is the amen to the word I can amen and doubt in my heart I can say Amen loud on this Earth I can even agree intellectually that this is the bride this is the time he fulfilled Revelation or Genesis 18 yeah Revelation 10 I agree with all of that but my life is nowhere near manifesting Christ I say God I need that visitation amen I need a visitation from you personally to me amen that'll that'll give me Faith to conceive the seed of this word so that you can reproduce yourself through me he has no hands but your hands no feet but your feet no eyes you are the body of Jesus Christ according to the Apostle Paul his body On Earth Is His Bride if he's going to do anything he must do it through her amen brother man said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he says you become nothing Christ becomes alive you die he lives listen he died so I can live now I must die so he can live life comes by death my spiritual life came by his physical death amen now his life and me will come by me dying to the flesh when I die he lives again when I die he promised me life and I died out to myself so in order I can have his life and how how do I do it by taking his word his seed put a seed in here by faith and believe it and then it produces exactly what the Bible said it's gone you know the natural types to spiritual and in the natural types in the spiritual you know a woman is made we know that now life comes in a perverted way but God still allows it it works to his perfect will and his permissive will but a man has life within him he has seed he is live but that man needs another body to bring forth the life that's in him is that right he needs a womb he needs a woman he needs a counterpart he needs his wife but the wife she has no power to bring forth life on her own she needs to seed from the man and how does she get the seed from the men the only way is for her to completely surrender herself she can't work she can't produce she can't put forth ever what she does is surrender and in her surrendering herself the man can do the work to bring forth to life we must surrender to Christ Christ has deceived he's got what I need I can't do nothing I can't do nothing of myself but I come to him but Christ he needs a body to work through to reproduce himself and I want to be that body I want to lay down my life and surrender and say I give myself holy to you so that you can come and produce your life through me amen what's it going to take it's going to take surrender not I'm going to live this life I'm going to take this I'm going to go and get we're not going to go and get anything amen amen I'm telling you if the if if the man doesn't sow the seed there's nothing that you're going to do as a woman there's nothing you're going to do I'm going to produce life I'm going to have a family I'm going to do this I can show you I don't need a man please if the man's not willing Amen to sow the seed there's no life coming amen so the only thing we can do is say Lord I surrender all hey I'm here Lord amen you told me to receive the spirit I'm receiving your spirit now I'm open to it you can't give it to yourself you can't take it you can't make it but all you can do is go to the source and say you promise this is your word I believe it in my heart and now I receive it I open myself to receive you in me so your word so your life so your spirit into my soul and manifest your life why this is the seventh seal and this brings him to Earth the son of man came to Earth the mighty Angel has descended Christ himself returned to the church where where was he returned to the church in that prophet I saw him he said it's not me it's Christ but that's not where his destination went to be he wanted to be in his bride that Ministry came to connect the bride and the body together and what's the bride to do she under the seventh seal is to bring him to Earth in what form in Bride form in Mrs Jesus Christ form she can't do it herself he must sow something into her to bring the life but she must receive by faith the the the life the receive the power to conceive strength to conceive by what by faith by God revealing to me who I am en unless God reveals to me who I am seed can be sown every Sunday every way good seed pure seed true seed Abraham was sowing good seed Amen in the early years of their marriage but she never conceived every Sunday Wednesday good seed good seed but even after she was turned young she needed a visitation to give her strength to conceive that good seed the message of the hour is good seed it's the seed of Christ it's the word listening to the message reading the message coming to preaching where the word is being preached it's sowing good seed amen but I need something more than being able to say that's right that's true I need strength to conceive because I need to know that whatever that is I am that's for me and I'm the recipient of that word that in the womb of my heart is where that seed is supposed to land because I'm part of it I'm part of Christ I'm part of the plan I'm the recipient for the seed and I'm also the place of manifestation how did Sarah conceive seed by faith how will we conceive seed by faith I need that visitation so that I can know that this is for me I can believe it's for the bride I can believe it's for Abraham's seed I can believe it's for brother random I must believe it's for me in Christ is the mystery of God revealed again he says and organizations from Men of God who went forth to establish truth in the earth before that truth could go on and Proclaim and proclamate and get on to the real revelation of Christ Fallen Angels came in and took it over and made denominations out of him that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded it had to unlock all that mystery of what's been wrong with the church all these years why didn't the first church produce what it was supposed to produce why have we had the denominations why was the Dark Ages what is all of this what is the Reformation what's it all about the Seven Seals unlocked the whole mystery so that we could rise above all of that nonsense and come back to origin the leaves the picture of church and churches and reformations and teaching and leave all of that and move so far up that we could see all the way back oh a Son of God and a wife and connected together reproduce themselves sons of God on the earth oh I get what this is all about it's not about teachings and it's not about church buildings and it's not a it's not about revivals and it's not about groups and it's not about doctrines amen it's all about Christ and a bride going back to Eden to what God originally wanted that's what was locked under the seventh seal the mystery of God Amen God becoming a family and fellowshipping with his attributes and love and in Harmony and in unity if this mystery hadn't been revealed we'd fall right back into the same cycle of getting more truce building walls to defend our truth honing everybody to the tree and missing the whole purpose of Truth coming and I'm afraid sometimes that's what we've done defend our truth got a new truth hold on to that truth don't lose that truth build a wall around the truth that it was never for you to gather around the this this teaching this Doctrine serpent seed and all of these things and wow whoa no it was to bring you to a higher understanding than to a higher understanding to unlock the mystery of the whole Bible why do we have to understand serpent seeds so I'll know why I came into this earth like this why I'm messed up and why I'm struggling when I love God so much and what it's going to take to get back to where I should have been from the beginning [Music] so that I wouldn't fall into the same traps of legalism really trying to reform flesh I'm not to perform flesh forget reforming flesh I need a transformation on the inside that'll control this flesh until the day the flesh changes I needed the revelation of the seals to bring me higher than Church ages Beyond denominations out of doctrinal fights and bring me back to the picture that God had in his mind before the foundation of the Lord and now every truth is painting brush Strokes in that picture and the point is to get the picture and know where I am in the picture I'm not in the church ages I'm not in I'm not allowed to seeing believer I've been called out of that to be a bride I'm in the age of the Union the invisible unity in Christ in his bride to come together to do what to do what to do what to reproduce the son of man again I'm here to lay my life down to surrender to him to receive his visitation receive his seed and allow that word to live through this flesh so that the world will see that Christ is on Earth and a bride because the seventh seal brings him to Earth and the seventh seal in this time has brought him to Earth where all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church that life was bound up in chain and held behind denominational Rivers for 2000 years but has been released at the opening of the seals the full life all that was poured into Christ Christ has poured all of it in the end time so that we have the power to conceive D so that we would have the power not by our power but by his power his life to Manifest this life friends that should throw us into desperation if that be true for me I cannot be sincere enough I cannot give up enough if this this is what the whole hour is for this is the whole purpose of my life this is why I'm planted here is to manifest his life I can't go on selfish I can't go on with my own wants I can't go on trampling over the word of God to have what I want I can't go on wait I can't go on Faking I can't go I'm playing a part I can't go on singing One Way at church and living another way I can't do that anymore this hour is a different hour I've got to surrender all that I am so that I can come to this manifestation of the hour that we live in what a travesty for God to come like he did on the planes of memory and he came in our day through a prophet to turn his back to a crowd and discern dozens of people in the crown so that there was no mistake that Jesus Christ was present and shows through every type in the Bible and through every scripture of the end time and fully manifest it and declare it what a shame for Sarah to be changed back to never bring forth Isaac but oh I'm so glad he's got a plan and I believe I'm part of that plan where I were left to me it would fail it's not left up to me it was left up to him all I can do is surrender myself to his plan and say God take your way with me should bring us to desperation should bring us to a constant seeking it should bring us to a constant place where we're saying God I need more I need more than what I had yesterday there's new challenges there's there's still old self I need more I need more of you and less of me Lord I want to die out I want to receive more there should be a constant need for more of him I'm one of the most dangerous things we can fold into is complacency where we feel like we've arrived that I'm the bride I've got the Revelation I've arrived now I'm just waiting for everybody else to catch up to where I am so our bodies can change right what a dangerous place to be friends I don't want to be in that place I want to be in the place where say Lord if there's any more for you to manifest manifest it through me Lord I know that I'm not to where I need to be I want to be further down the road I want to manifest your word help me God to die I want to be a sacrifice so that's the reason the Revelation the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded now you see it what they left off if Luther would have went on it had been here why because Luther was a predestinated seed if Luther would have kept moving in the revelation of the word he'd come to hear any predestinated seed if they would keep moving the Revelation word will come here we're not different than any other predestination from the first age second age third age they just didn't get to come here they didn't get to hear what we hear they didn't get the Revelation they weren't here for the unveiling of the seals amen we were positionally placed here to reveal a certain thing and we're predestinated see like they're predestinated so if Luther would if he would have been here if he would have went on if Leslie would have went on Pentecost would have went on what would they have done now there is only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can follow it and now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there can be no denomination and no not nothing else follow him you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on the predestinated fruit and she is ripening into christ-like Fruit bringing forth the same meloness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him the bridegroom tree without the bride tree can't produce the fruit Abraham without Sarah couldn't produce the fruit of his loins Christ without his bride which is a further revelation of himself won't produce the end time seed it'll be produced by in Christ comes through his bride when the two unite and she conceived seed and now Christ takes over and he manifests himself through her it will become so much fun she'll be coming in his very image she will be him one like the son of man standing in the midst of Seven Counties amen the seventh seal brings him back to Earth right now it's bringing back to Earth and a bride soon it'll bring him back to Earth as a revelation to 144 000. that's on the seventh year then it will bring him back to Earth as the son of David to sit on the throne of David to A Thousand Years the seventh seal brings him back to Earth but right now the seventh seal has brought him back to Earth in the formation of his bride and that's the manifestation of the hour and that's the manifestation I want to give all myself to you so that he can manifest that through me let's all stand the seventh seal is the completion what's the seven seal completing in US it's completing the marriage of Christ and his bride as a restoration Back to Eden he had to have a gentile bride and that was never completed his Gentile Pride was never completed and brought into Union with him until now that's the seventh seal for the Gentiles then to the Jews he'll restore the Jews the the nation will be born in a day under the 144 000. that's the seven sealed to them their seventh trumpet and then for the Earth there'll be a seventh seal when Christ and his bride Return To Rule and Reign for a thousand years the seventh day and the seventh seal brings him back to Earth I want the seventh seal to bring him back to Earth in me if you don't get anything else take this away if the seventh seal will bring him back to Earth it needs to bring him back to birth in me you can't say in my church it's not in my church it's not in my church it may be fine if it's in the people that attend your church but it's got to be manifest in me I have to have the Revelation I have to surrender myself I have to come into Union and I have to yield and I have to die so that he can live I have to have faith to conceive seed to bring forth Christ and I can only do it by the gift of God amen all I can do is recognize it to be nothing but the truth and all I can do is go to God and say God that ain't nothing but the truth I was preached it struck my heart I know it's nothing but the truth but God it's going to take you it's going to take you to bring it to life in me help me surrender help me wash out help me to to remove whatever I can remove but oh God it's going to take you I can't produce this life by myself I need you to come and do the work in me that I can do but oh how exciting to live in the day that this is the very manifestation of the hour when we ask for these things we're not asking for things that we hope to get we we're not asking for things that we hope will happen we're asking for things that we know are the manifestation of the hour will come according to the word asking according to the word yielding to the word so that the word could be made manifest in US this isn't oh I hope so no this is the hour this is the time and I'm one of them God live in me amen God bless you let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for your word God we stand Lord Believing by Revelation that we are your bride that you've called to manifest yourself in this end time Lord you've given us a heart to believe you've put something in us that could receive though thousands will walk away tens of thousands will shake their head something in us will say it's true it's all true and God we recognize by Your Grace by your faith the hour that we're living in and we're recognizing that it'll take you Lord manifesting yourself through us and in this Union that's what you want to do we've come to the union now I pray God that you would unlock the faith within us you can see this seed and let it bear Witness that you're alive that you're here that you're present that you're on the earth walking in flesh Again In the Flesh of your body your bride while we surrender ourselves to you pray that you would take full possession Lord for we are in the second fold of your threefold plan and that's that you will get preeminence the very reason you preached your word is so we could surrender to it so that we could receive it so that you could come and manifest yourself in Bride form and here we are Lord you told your disciples to receive the spirit and you breathed on them God you breathed your word Upon Us you've commanded us to receive it Lord I receive it Jesus Christ's name I receive all of your word let it live in me we stand just as helpless as any woman is to bring forth life on our own but God we're standing here surrendered to you inviting you to come and bring forth your life through us we thank you for the hour we live and we thank you for the revelation of the seals we thank you for peeling back the mystery opening that seventh seal and revealing the mystery of yourself God you've given us such Faith to walk in this hour but it seems so impossible for human beings to come to this level of life God you made it possible by the preaching of the word and when you preach the word and you open the seals you release the power a life to come back into your church and God you're pouring it in even now under the preaching of the word Lord we're receiving it Lord we're lifting our cups fill us Lord fill us to overflowing with this life you're pouring out amongst us and Lord may it flow out of us become a well of Living Water a spring of Living Water welling up into everlasting life we love you God we ask for your blessings over your people over your word may it find deep root in our lives we love you God take us as we go from here bless us and keep us help us as we come back to the communion service this afternoon by your will May the sign of your grace take place in our hearts as we recognize what you've done for us bless us in between in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you friends let's come back hear it we can't at four o'clock for communion and feet washing and let's say God bless you man you have a song about it [Music] I've had it all but what I need is just more of things [Music] Lord for more [Music] [Music] [Music] years please I am empty yeah Lord hear my voice amen God bless you brother Irvin Ray would you come and just greet the people for just a second say hello and close us out in a word of Prayer I like for brother Irvin to give a chance to just say hello to you and then just dismiss us in a word of prayer brother [Music] thank you greetings to everybody it was a blessing to be here thank you for receiving us and for Dave Woods that they opened their house last night we could have a great fellowship with them and good night of rest and what a blessing it was a blessing to be here to hear about the seventh seal we just started to receive this message since New Year's I think January was the first time I would start reading William branham's message just the seven h book The Red Book was so dear I stood up at four o'clock in the morning to just get more of it we never heard anything like this I didn't know anything about William Branham a year ago I didn't know there was a man like that and I didn't know it took a profit to reveal the Mysteries why did God come through Junction City why did Jesus come through Junction City [Music] for me my wife and of our friends one thing I want to share I wasn't going to be up here but Chad put me on a spot it doesn't matter but we were in a real good church or we we thought we were in the best Church in the world we really did but we were having problems and so I don't know if anybody of you know chantis and Franklin he taught about fasting and prayer a 21 day fast and different things so somebody gave us that book and so we went on a 21 day fast and prayer and brothers and sisters I'm telling you if you're serious if you fast for 21 days is so Daniel's fast like we can read in Daniel like he fast for three weeks a liquid fast if you do that if you pray and fast God will move in your life and I think as far as we know everybody that went on that fast and fasted for three weeks left at church seriously so we believe that and we we've done that since that and God answered prayers for us and opened our heart and mind to receive the word of God for in this hour and we thought we were right but we were in the denomination loss when I I often wandered in Revelation Chapter 2 uh when where it talks about the Jezebel woman um I often wonder why would God kill somebody's children with death now I know what he's talking about now I know what he's talking about it's by the grace of God that I'm here today so we had Chad come down he preached a message for us here a couple weeks ago Kyle and his family was down we would have loved to just keep them guys down there we need a pastor like that to teach us we had Jesse Smith down he taught us wonderful things and so now we had a baptismal service he Jesse came down he one evening he baptized 17 there later we went Kyle baptized the one up in brinkhaven that we were witnessed to and then a couple weeks ago [Music] Jad baptized three more so it's just it's just amazing to me how God brought things together from one person to the other and and when we left the Amish Church an English man told me you're going to make a lot of new friends [Music] here we are and and the good thing is they're true friends it's just amazing to me how the spirit of God moves and how it works in people's lives and how we can connect to each other last night when I met Dave we were brothers we just connected same as Jet and you guys it's just a blessing if you got the spirit of God within you it it'll draw people together with the same spirit but not everybody thinks well of us there's people that think now we're deceived because we left the Amish system but I know where we stand in January I was one morning as I was having devotions God gave me a revelation of Matthew 16 about Upon This Rock I will build my church and that changed the whole Bible a new Bible came out that he is the revelation of the word and he gave us many Revelations since and I'm looking forward for more and more and more to grow in Christ praise God thank you for having us and may God's blessings be richly upon you and I ask for your prayers that we can grow in Christ and keep growing and be in a witness for him in this Future Let's borrow his prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for Jesus Christ we thank you Lord for your love for us thank you Lord that we can be here and thank you that we have ears that you open our ears and hearts that we can hear your voice and your word thank you Lord that you gave us Grace to hear your word Lord help us that we can walk a life that people will see Christ in our lives Thank You Lord For the Living Water and Lord I just ask that you'd protect every person in here from the world from Satan and his Twisted schemes Lord I ask to just help us lead us guide and direct us and Lord may you bless everyone here today and help us that we can be faithful and looking forward for your appearing to meet you in the air thank you Lord for this and we pray this all in Jesus worthy name amen [Music] flow through me Holy Spirit Through Me Oh flow through oh yeah [Music] as I live my head to worship and to man ifest Holy Spirit flow through oh living me oh living [Applause] for here living oh
