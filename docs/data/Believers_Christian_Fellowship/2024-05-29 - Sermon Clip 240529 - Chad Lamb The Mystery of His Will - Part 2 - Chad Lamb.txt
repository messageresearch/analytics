========================================

and we know that speech sometimes is different than what we consider speech amen what we call speech is speech amen but the the Bible in the Psalms as it describes the heavenlies amen it says they speak a language amen and it goes out all over the their speech is heard by all the world Amen what what speech do the stars give that hits your eardrum right amen but they're speaking of the glory of God they're speaking of the handywork of God Amen their voice utth out the things of God their speech goes to the ends of the world praise God so this word is so much deeper it can be represented on paper it can be represented audibly as what we call audibly it can be represented amen through signs through wonders through through mirica it can be represented in many ways amen but what it is is the thought of God coming into manifestation that is this word amen and it embodies the concept or idea so this is the this is the thing that becomes so important because if I get the audible part that hits my ear and then I go to act that out in life and the way I act it out is not according to God's thought then I did not get the logos although I got words I got what we would call words I did not get the logos because now my actions are different than God's thinking when he spoke that word or when he had a prophet speak it or when he had men of old put it down and pin it out on a scroll amen whatever was in God's mind amen is the word the thought becoming the word the word must contain that thought in order to be logos this is why this is why you can read and you can read and you can read and you can read but without the spirit of Revelation amen we're not going to get any further than the denominations are getting and there's nothing wrong with reading and there's nothing wrong with respecting the word and I believe God will even honor those who do it sincerely amen but we need more than the ability to read we need more than just a great translation of the Bible brother Brenham says so much what we need is the spirit of Revelation to tap us back into the mind of God and God in his Mercy amen he sent down a voice in our day the voice of God Amen that could tap into the back part of God's mind and bring the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication so that we don't have to question what God meant by this verse you just go back and find what the prophet said because the prophet was the mouthpiece of God he wasn't his own mouthpiece he was the mouthpiece of God and so now this is why in my life I'm not trying as a a as as a Christian who's been predestinated into the adoption of children to be conformed into the image of Christ who is the anointed word amen so I've been predestinated to come into the image of the anointed word amen so that's why I'm not here in this life to contradict the prophet or to correct the prophet or to change what he said or to make it more malleable to my station in life amen because I'm here to get the thought behind the word and how am I going to do it with my own intellect we need a we needed a voice at the end of time we needed the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication
