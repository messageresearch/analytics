[0:00] you could see now how cain could be
[0:02] justified
[0:03] by the mercy of god
[0:07] cain could feel justified like he was
[0:10] correct
[0:12] because god agreed with his protest
[0:17] gave him protection put a mark upon him
[0:20] to protect him
[0:22] and then he goes out and seemingly the
[0:24] curse
[0:25] takes no effect because
[0:28] now he begins to establish civilization
[0:31] in cities
[0:34] and now it looks as though what god said
[0:37] now it looks as though
[0:38] his protest changed the entire mind of
[0:42] god
[0:44] but god was not looking at stability and
[0:46] security in the carnal sense the same
[0:48] way
[0:48] cain was looking at it he was looking at
[0:51] security and stability coming from those
[0:53] by revelation would be attached to his
[0:55] word
[0:55] and that would be the security and that
[0:57] would be their steadiness and that would
[0:59] be their protection
[1:00] and cain would never have that stability
[1:03] he would always wonder from doctrine to
[1:05] doctrine and man's idea to man's idea
[1:07] and new god to new god another idea to
[1:09] other idea
[1:10] amen but the children of god would have
[1:12] the word of god as stability
[1:14] and security because they would have it
[1:16] by revelation
[1:18] so he was a vagabond amen and he was a
[1:20] fugitive and a vagabond
[1:22] outside the presence of god amen where
[1:24] where seth's line
[1:26] they begin to call on the name of god
[1:30] says line at the same time they begin to
[1:32] call upon the name of god
[1:34] amen they were not listen they were not
[1:36] just
[1:37] saying there's a god amen it wasn't as
[1:40] though cain continued to worship
[1:41] cain continued to be religious cain
[1:44] continued to worship
[1:45] god but he worshiped god
[1:48] his way and he became
[1:52] unstable in that worship he became
[1:55] faltering and teetering and wandering
[1:57] and now he would incorporate other gods
[1:59] and begin to worship son and worship
[2:01] moon
[2:01] amen and worship other things and then
[2:02] he began to make idols
[2:06] what was he he was unstable he was a
[2:08] fugitive in a bag of vagabond outside
[2:10] the presence of god
[2:12] and he continued to worship god but he
[2:15] worshiped the god of his own heart his
[2:16] own imagination of his own design
[2:20] but seth began to call upon the name
[2:24] of the lord he didn't want to worship
[2:28] god
[2:29] he wanted to know god
