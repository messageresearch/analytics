========================================

there's so many times that we get into problems in our families we get into uh trials let's say we get into a marital situation where there's marital strife and and then all of a sudden we need deliverance we cry out to God save our marriage save our Deliver Us help us and we go to the pastor we go to counsel we do whatever we can we get everybody praying that's wonderful but the Deliverance was already in the Commandment yeah amen if you go back to Ephesians and just take what Paul the Apostle said right husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church wives see that you reverence your husbands no matter what kind of trouble you find yourself in and no matter what kind of problem comes your way if we'll just work it back to the word I guarantee there's a breakdown in that Simplicity of that Commandment that the Apostle Paul we broke it down somewhere either that man did not love his wife the way Christ loves the church or that wife was not reverencing her husband and it brought a breakdown in the family and we we could call it all kinds of things we stress because of work and the finances are this and the kids are that no the reality is somewhere we stopped obeying the word and when we left the word amen we left the protection of the word and now we got all kinds of tension and strife when what we need to do is repent and come back to the word and God will bless his word amen amen we we we come to the stage where we have teenagers and and the whole world expects that teenagers are problems they're all problems listen I have raised five teenagers and they've been no problem whatsoever and it's not because I'm smart has nothing to do with that but I absolutely believe the word of God that there's a promise in that word amen and if I do what the scriptures tell me to do in discipline and requiring obedience keeping them in the word keeping the atmosphere in my home I believe with all my heart that God will keep the devour away from my door I believe with all my heart amen you know I'm speaking in generalities I know that bad things can happen and difficult situations I don't want anybody feel condemned but the reality is God has made us promises and if we stay behind the word it has to work friends it's got to work and we can say what do I do about my rebellious child they won't listen to me they won't do anything I say they won't the problem was not 16 17 the problem started at 12 months 18 18 months when you didn't do what the Bible said to train a child in the way should go and when he's older he'll not depart brother R said it's not child delinquency it's parent delinquency is the problem so you can see it's the simple obedience to the word of God and letting the word shape our lives that is protecting us from so much trouble amen I mean we can just look around we are a spared people I don't know I mean and most of you have jobs have families have associations outside the framework of the church and you see the catastrophe that are striking lives everywhere not just rebellious children now children addicted to drugs at young age promiscuity amen all kinds of horrible things that people are dealing with and we don't have to deal with it why don't we have to deal with it he man was it cuz we're a better people cuz we're smarter cuz we're wiser because we got our ducks in a row it has nothing to do with that this is simply a product of obedience to the word of God we have come to the word we have practiced the word and the word has produced the results that he promised it would be produce it's not a mystery it's a reality
