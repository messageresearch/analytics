========================================

[Music] oh is and yet i am lord hear my [Music] my prayer is for i've opened all won't you come inside oh lord my heart is over foreign won't you come inside more leaving all of these oh [Music] oh is here jesus is [Music] oh [Music] all things are possible only oh [Music] oh praise the lord all things are possible on a wednesday night in a snowstorm all things are possible praise god man it's good to be here with you we're going to continue on with the message shalom and thank the lord for bringing you out safely tonight on such a beautiful night amen god is good you know one thing we've learned is we can't predict the weather but praise god we've got a company of angels that accompany us amen let's take our bibles and turn to isaiah 60. we're going to read those two scriptures that brother branham reads at the beginning of this book to refresh in our minds the way he started the message here in shalom i also would like to announce at the end of service young natalie wholesale would like to be baptized tonight so i told her this is a memorable night you'll never forget getting baptized in a snowstorm and i said just don't tell people that the water was heated you know just tell him you were baptized in the middle of a snowstorm amen so we're excited to do that and we thank god for that i also want to remind you that brother aaron mcgeary will be here on sunday and he'll be taking both services the morning service and the afternoon service and we will be having communion and feet washing after the second service so pray for his family they'll be traveling up tomorrow and keep them in your prayers also i'd like to remind you friday the prayer time here in the sanctuary from 1 to 5 and also saturday from 5 to 10. so keep that in your mind all right let's look at isaiah chapter 60 together isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth in gross darkness to people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee this is such an important scripture to know that brother branham starts with this scripture when he's preaching shalom because he says arise and shine forth thy light has come right and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee because brother branham is talking about shalom he's going to be talking of the breaking of a new day and the rising of the sun and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee for behold darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise this is the rising of the sun the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee praise be to god amen that is the rising of the sun but where will it be upon thee amen let's turn to psalm 62 this is the other scripture that brother banham opened with for this service psalm 62 and verse 1 we'll read from 1 to 8. psalm 62 1-8 truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will you imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly sila my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us sila amen let's bow our heads to pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this night lord we thank you for the opportunity to be gathered together and for the protection that you gave us on the road coming in and lord we we've come here lord to listen to this tape tonight lord i pray that you would break it fresh to us lord may it not be something that was from long ago but lord maybe realize that this was for today and may you bring it fresh to us as fresh manna from heaven lord and open our ears to here in our eyes to see and that we may perceive what you're trying to speak to us tonight lord bless us in jesus christ's name amen you can all be seated i want to do a just a quick review on where we've been and then move on to the next section we're reading the message shalom from 1964 and like i said every time i pick up a book or start a message i like to know where i'm at where i'm at in the prophet's life where i'm at in the sequence of events so this is the first message brother branham is going to preach he calls it his new year's message and the first message he's preaching in the year 1964 he preaches it january 12 1964 and he preaches it in a place called sierra vista arizona if you open to the not to the if you open to the front cover and then turn the page one more time down in the bottom left hand corner you have some details on the message i like to go through this because we've always got young people coming up and teenagers and kids who are grabbing books for the first time and if you look down here it gives you the title shalom and it tells you the year and the date 1964 01 january 12th so it was january 12th it says a message by brother william marion branham was delivered on sunday morning january 12 1964 at a house meeting in sierra vista arizona usa the the tape number 64-0112 is two hours and 22 minutes so i always look at this i don't know i just like details so for me i always look at this because i want to know where he preached it i want to know you know it's nice to know sometimes the crowd he's addressing it to because brother branham sometimes changes the way he phrases things depending on the crowd he's speaking to and so sometimes it's nice to know is he speaking to a denominational crowd here he's in a home meeting of people who accept his message so he's a little freer and in jeffersonville he's very free and so it's important to know where he's preaching amen and where he is in the timeline of events now 1964 was a huge year for the supernatural we have the sword in the hand the i mean moving the arizona the sword in the hand the cloud appearing coming and preaching the seals and then all the events that happened after that it was a huge year and now he's moving into 1964 and this is his first message and he's in arizona preaching this in a house meeting so i like those things i like to know where we're at it helps me when i read this and also as i go through i brother branham doesn't just pick titles you know for me everything he did was ordained he's not just picking titles because they're cute he's not picking titles but this title means something shalom and so when i listen to this message i like to know what the title is and hold it in my mind because that's what he's trying to get us to see is what is this shalom amen so i asked a few questions last time i'm just going to go over two of them the first one is what is shalom so if you turn with me to is it page seven we'll go to the bottom of page 7 paragraph 38 now my text for this morning is an odd word shalom shalom in the hebrew means peace and that's what i say to the church this morning shalom that's peace turn the page over to page 8 and go down to paragraph 43 then the church the reason i'd say shalom to them is because that it's god's peace so he says it's peace but then he references it's god's peace the true shalom is god's peace then we ask the question what is a rock in scripture because when we read from uh psalms chapter 62 says the lord is my rock and my salvation and and if we look at uh back on page 7 at paragraph 32 he answers this question now if you notice in the scripture reading there in the psalms it kept saying god is my rock do you know what a rock represents in the bible a rock in the bible here represents the revelation of god see god is my revelation he he is see the revelation of the word is the rock go down to paragraph 37 and david's speaking here god is our rock god is our rock when god has been revealed to us that becomes a roxy god is our rock so we can say god is a rock but unless god has been revealed to us then god is not our rock it's the revelation of the word and i would say it's the revelation of the word for our day that becomes the rock and god becomes our rock when god has revealed to us the word revealed for our day that is the rock that is the rock of salvation that is the the rock that we hide in that is the rock that we're supported by that is a rock in the scripture so we've got to be careful that when we say uh god is a rock that we know what brother brennan means that it's the revelation of the word the revelation of god that is given to us praise the lord let's turn over to page 14. we're going to begin at the top of page 14 at paragraph 70. i'm going to ask a couple questions i'd like to have these questions so that we all are working these out together as we go through so if you've got a pen and paper and you like to write them down we'll go through a couple questions here the first question is what does the moon represent so brother bryan's going to explain this and many of us already know these things but it's interesting to hear him say it and go through it question number one what does the moon represent question number two why is the church in darkness so question 1 was what does the moon represent question 2 why is the church in darkness question number three what is the light to the church what is the light to the church number three number four what does the morning star testify of so number four what does the morning star testify i'm trying to go slow because there's smoke rolling off of pins number four what does the morning star testify of and then number five what did they hate jesus for brother makes a specific statement and here we'll hear what did they hate jesus for number five so we're going to begin on page 14 paragraph 70 and we'll go to the bottom of paragraph 165 on page 28. i'm not going to try to get the whole thing finished today we're going to break it into three parts so we can take some time and discuss it as we go and so we will begin top of page 14 paragraph 70. brother franco if you can go ahead and turn that on for us that son is a word of god in the beginning god said let there be light and when the manifested word of god when the word of god was manifested there was light first god spoke it what if it didn't manifest then it wasn't light yet but when he spoke it and then it was manifested vindicated his word was a vindicated light come into existence that's the only way it can be done now it's when the word is vindicated god's written word a vindicated then it shows light it's a portion lip are put out for each age we found in the church ages we find in the old the old testament church ages each time that there come a time for a a certain manifestation of a journey there was a prophet came to the earth and the word came to the prophet and he made that word live and when that word was identified it reflected god and there was the the age there was a light that's way light comes today now i have nothing against any denomination uh people but i have all that i can think about against the systems because they're wrong and the first system that ever rose up was the the roman system of the roman catholic church that was the first organization that ever was organized as a roman catholic church nazi aroma about 325 years after the death of christ 325 came forth the roman church organization that put the people together and blended out anything else that was contrary to it that's where they got their strange doctrines and started off in a system away from the word and now that church since that time has exactly reflected darkness because at that time we go through what we call the dark ages about a thousand years it's known to all historians and bible scholars and so forth as the dark ages that's when the roman church controlled everything and this roman church is the the mother of harlots the bible said in revelation 17 she was mother of hearts now that is immoral unclean living of a woman both of them is the same thing both the same so if if uh harlot it had to be a woman so therefore you notice it's not harlot but harlots see she is her singular then the church's is called harlots daughters of the roman uh she is a mother of all of it the mother of organization and is it not a strange thing that in this day that when we have come through all these things and the message has crossed the earth against organization it's blasted it from right to left that in this hour that's been told since 1933 when the holy spirit gave me that visions and showed me the end time seven things that i spoke of and five of them has already happened perfectly right on like germany and italy and all the wars and the national things seldom speaks to me on those things but they happened just exactly the way he said that happened how mussolini would go to ethiopia and ethiopia followed his step and then how did he come to a disgrace and be spit on by his own people and this grace hung upside down with that prostitute that he lived with on the street how that the americas would go to war with germany to take an awful beating at a place called a great line where there would be concrete fortified and they're i believe it's called the siegfried line and uh there's one called meds now i believe that was a french was that right and the siegfried line was a german and the lord let me see that 11 years before it was built amen and they never would admit getting a beating on it the americans wouldn't know they almost sunk the complete army when they wanted or the germans had their guns just trained right out on that fleet let it get right in there and almost sunk it i've seen that 11 years before the line was ever ever a foundation was ever poured for it or anything the siegfried line and all these other things like machines and automobiles and and how everything has come right down exactly what he said until a woman ruling this nation which perhaps is the church and then the income now we find that in this all this thing and have blasted against the organization isn't it a strange thing that the pope of rome would leave rome for his first time to go back to jerusalem amen and doing this jerusalem is known the oldest church in all the world when melchizedek met abraham from the slaughter of the kings he was a king of jerusalem a priest which was christ it was god no one else could be melchizedek but christ himself a god himself brother god himself because he was without father and without mother see jesus had both father and mother so this man was without father without mother without beginning a days or ending of life and whoever he was he still lives and he was king at that time of salem which is interpreted king of peace shalom king of jerusalem who met abraham and give him wine and bread communion after the battle a very beautiful type there in the seventh chapter of hebrews we find it now gave him bread and wine after the battle was over as he that's the first thing we'll take after we enter into the new kingdom we'll eat it anew with him in the father's kingdom the bread and wine not drink the fruit of the vine or eat the bread anymore until i idiot you and you and the father's kingdom that day now now when we find out that after king shalom was in the come from the city then creed took it over later and it's constantly being created but it represents the old church and we're taught in the new testament don't fail to get this in the new testament that we are not of this city jerusalem on earth but we are from the new jerusalem above so this must be the moon jerusalem and not the new jerusalem above so the moon representing the church earthly and uh isn't it strange that just before the pope took his journey to jerusalem that the moon in the heavens made a total blackout amen just a few days before he took it his journey he's coming here also you know now that's never been known but what does it show that this is doing this to wind fellowship as he met on the day after he come into jerusalem he met the greek orthodox hierarchy and what does that reflect fellowship their wanting protestants and catholicism joining together which they are doing and will completely do and god reflected this to us in the moon of a total blackout amen by his mercy grace did any of you see the paper where they took the pictures of the moon i have it here if it ain't a perfect image leaving out the seventh age which is not yet exactly the way i drawed but the holy spirit the church ages there's the six of them the seventh is not finished yet the six conditions of the moon how in its brightness in the first church age darken the second third fourth fifth and sixth just the way the holy spirit let me draw them on the board and then identified him with himself on the wall of the tabernacle two years ago the moon reflects itself and science again picks up the picture of the church ages just as they picked up that light hunter and put it in life magazine of the opening of the seals are the revealing in the age of the seventh angel in the days of his ministry the seventh messenger the mysteries of god which all the mysteries has been along the ages should be revealed made manifest it should be at that time amen and he did it his words don't fail isn't that a mysterious thing god drawing in the heavens the same thing that the whole scene god let me draw on the blackboard and then by himself that's three times he's perfectly identified and just before the pope goes in uh to jerusalem which that was the church the moon is the church represents the church and before the church the shadow of the world crosses the moon and the shadow of worthyism amen the shadow of willingness worthy church has swept across the blackout the entire life of the bible the world got in the light of the reflection do you understand the world crossed the in the light of the moon and blinded out the sun and the reflection of the moon that's supposed to be giving light to the earth it was blacked out and it come in and draw the pictures just exactly like it did by inspiration before it happened now that i believe sister simpson was a tucson paper uh i don't know his sister's son simpson she didn't understand it and she said i cut out some pictures for you and some notes out of the paper and handed to me i thought something strange i went in there and picked it up looked at i said there it is just exactly see just what i've been looking for and there it was in the paper sister simpson might tell you what paper it's in if you want to get a copy of it and by saying evening edition of december the 28th see before he went to jerusalem to block out his life or what excess it does have what time position and what rights it has to shine now it's cutting it off altogether for the last age the seventh church age where she goes into darkness what a great thing the lord is telling us and everything it's never failed but what god in the heaven has declared it and told it look to it and here's identified it and vindicated it that it is the absolute truth darkness this lady i see a church age now when jesus which is the word in the ladies church age was on the outside of the church knocking at the door trying to get in darkness gross darkness upon this people was a bible right the perfection of the scripture glory of his great name the pope's visit was a sign of the churches blackening out his manifested uh the manifested light of the world was the bible jesus said he was the light of the world the bible said that he is the word and the manifested or the vindicated scripture is the light now you'll not be permitted to do it when this takes a hold and we've seen it foreshadowed told by inspiration before it happens foreshadowed by the moon and shorts happen and here it is taking place the hour is upon us darkness gross darkness grows darkness on the people now that's what it is what does it all mean where are we standing what how are we in how close are we to the coming well they say when all they have a revival fear not little flock it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom all right what does it mean god has begun to separate the light from the darkness see pressing it behind like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of a new day the church ages are fading out for me the church ages are fading out god is pressing the darkness into a place that has to do it to fade out the church organizations fade out the world the world is covering the thing over and over the whole thing that isn't god right by worldly things in worldly dressing and worldly acting and worldly living it's the world ye are not of the world little children amen you are heaven this is not your home why should i look to us older people try to look back and get young again we can't do that but we're looking forward not looking back looking here what has been we won't know what's going to be and we're looking for that hour pressing part so many good sincere people today are caught away in these creeds these churches and organizations having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof as second timothy the third chapter says so gross darkness blinding of israel was for the lightning of the gentiles now the blinding of the gentiles is the lightning of the israel it's just like the day and night one side has got darkness the other side's got light and the light comes over on the other side so the moon passing the way it did and the reflection of the darkness of the world blinding out its light is a reflection of us that the gentile church age is finished amen the church is making herself ready then make herself ready for a time it's time for the rapture for darkness is fading upon the gentiles and dawn will soon break upon the jews the sun has traveled from the east to the west and we're on the west coast the light can only do one thing go back east on the other side you understand do you the light can only go back east again to where it began at israel god blinded them for a while but the the darkness now is pressed upon the gentile world that's covered the whole thing the gentiles will trod down jerusalem until amen the gentile dispensation will be finished jesus said so and now it's finished amen gross darkness upon the people god reflected in the skies as he has shown it on earth before it all happens we're in it good people caught in this thing good people sincere people like mary and joseph they were very sincere see thinking he was with them when he wasn't amen mary and joseph you know when is up to the feast jesus the age of 12 they thought presuming he was with them but he wasn't good people today think the same thing they these people it's organizing this council of churches these people in these organizations they they think they're doing a good thing they're presuming he's with them when they're not see many people think that he was with them when they shook hands with a preacher and put their name on the book but he wasn't many people thought when they were uh uh sprinkled confirmed baptized the name of father son holy ghost thinking he was with them they're good people mary and joseph was good people but the facts was he wasn't there don't pursue anything what is life the vindicated spoken word of god outside of that there's no light [Applause] see can't lighten the earth with flashlights it takes god's word that's made manifest the son they were good people no accuracy of his word how perfect it is did you notice what mary said now to you dear catholic people i'm not against you i have nothing against you it's a system that you're in and your protestants the same thing it's the systems mary mother of god find out a 12 year old boy of her own son had a center in order there's not one time in the bible where jesus ever called mary his mother she wasn't his mother amen amen how could she be a mother of god amen she was only a womb amen that he used to come to the earth to be manifested to the earth through the womb there's nothing to it at all not one scripture ever said mother amen notice how mary is so wrong but his words so perfect she said to him when she found him in the temple at 12 discussing with the theologians he was down to them as a 12 year old boy not even in school or if it is we have no record of it but a 12 year old lad confounding the sages in the temple that is wisdom amen amen she said thy father and i have sought thee with tears thy father the mother herself supposingly said thy father joseph and i had sought thee with tears what did he say to her know ye not that i must be about my father's business if he'd been about joseph business he'd been making houses or in a carpenter shop but he wasn't joseph's son amen i'm about my father's business correcting these denominations and creeds and things i hear um about my father's business he never admitted joseph was his father but mary did and he turned back around and straightened her out she said your father and i have sought you said i'm about my father's business showing joseph wasn't his father his words are perfect amen but mary in them just presuming that well see what it was she got carried away she she got she wanted to show before these priests and things that that she wasn't the type of woman and she in doing that she absolutely tore the foundation out from under her testimony amen after she had testified that an angel had come to her and said thou shalt conceive and bear a son knowing no man a virgin born son here before the high sanhedrin she says joseph your father here and i have sought you and that 12 year old boy said i'm about my father's business he rebuked her that isn't my father see the church today carried away with councils and and things of the world now she's blacked out god's rebuking here never did jesus ever call her mother one day she came to visit him at his meeting in a house something like this someone come said outside the door there your mother and brothers wait for you he said who is my mother my brothers who are they looked right upon his disciples and said they that do the will of my father is my mother my brother my sister so forth that's who it does and at the cross when he was dying he said to john a young disciple he said behold thy mother amen woman behold thy son son behold thy mother see never cleaned himself it wasn't her son it was god's son she was just a womb this is a house this morning but it's not the church amen the church is in you christ the spirit of the mortals is sitting here met together in heavenly places it's christ not the house the house is all right it's serving its purpose but it's only used for a meeting place mary was only a womb amen that he used to come to the earth to be identify himself amongst the people not the mother of god no more than this house is a church of god it's just used for that yeah many friends think now people good people like mary and joseph think that that he's with them in doing this but as they were then so are they now mistaken he thought this with him but there wasn't but uh when they was baptized people might thought oh i received him when i accepted him was baptized that isn't it the spoken word reflects itself but the elected what about the light now i've been talking so much on the dark and i've got half my time up 11 30. now let's turn it back around gross darkness is up on the people now what about the light he said gross darkness would be upon the people but there would be life rise and shine for the light has come how can it be darkness and light it's got to be separated amen and only one thing separates it the word amen amen separates it presses it to the other side here's the darkness on the earth but when the manifested word of god the sun which was spoken into existence by the word shows itself darkness runs to the other side amen that's what's taking place now amen darkness separating the self from the light now to the electric church in this dark hour which we could stay on that for hours but i think i've said enough do you understand why what the scripture means when i set the gross darkness upon this people nah say to the church shalom hey god's peace peace ever true hebrew when he means to that shalom in other words good morning god be with you god's peace go with you it's a good morning how do you do it's breaking day church amen that's darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church christ is appearing among us shalom peace hallelujah amen shalom when we see darkness settling dark it's just before day we know that the morning stars hanging on her to introduce the coming sun it's that's when the morning star shines it's uh it's it's the going between it's always dark as just a few minutes before dave the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day is because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning amen that's him among us his word being identified shalom the great day is fixing to break when the morning breaks eternal bright and fair when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky when the roll is called up beyond earth i'll be there our names are on his book we'll be there shalom good morning peace be unto you the darkness is separating itself from the light god's caused it the lights are doing it see the lights press itself in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together they've had a chance to accept it and they wouldn't do it so it's condensed itself and they do that by the putting the church together in the council churches and united with the pagan darkness they so firmly disagree with one another but yet they had to go together to make the night come upon the people isaiah 6 and 1 says arise and shine for the light has come to you rise and shine the light has come the word light is vindicated again the light vindicated again god's word so that you can see god manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age see these promises is made for this day these promises that were said by the prophets and by jesus himself in this day god and sun are times hebrews 1 god and son are a time in diverse manners spake to the fathers to the prophets but in this last day to his son jesus christ amen the great light that hung in the wilderness which was at moses forsake egypt esteeming the reproach of christ greater treasures than that of egypt the same one that met saul on the road down to damascus a great light hung before him that same light same pillar of fire saul of being a hebrew would never worship any spirit in there call it lord in the position he was in he said lord who are you said i'm jesus amen jesus said i come from god and i go to god that same light has come amen to what to manifest amen to to make known to the people amen the promises that he's made for this day manifested life of the day the darkness is dark and when he come he was the light of the day they were supposed to become a messiah and he came just exactly like god said he did would come and when he did what was he the light of the day and it pressed the darkness so against him amen is that right he had to give his life that the like continue could shine he was the light of the day but why why was he the light of day he was the vindicated word that had been spoken made manifest amen no more than god said over this dark gloomy dismal marsty world that stood here without light he said let there be light and it wasn't life until that word was manifested that was life he said there will come a savior a messiah [Applause] it still wasn't manifested until he come to manifest that promise and when he vindicated that promise he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify on me they said we don't know when style cometh we are moses disciples he said if you were moses disciples you'd know me for moses wrote on me amen he was a manifestation he was the authentication of the spoken word of god by moses amen and today that we're now living in god has come on the scene amen to vindicate and prove his promises so it's the light of the hour so we can rise and shine amen the light shines upon us again today the word is being made manifest it's a light just like that light shining out there the sunshine this morning that's god's spoken word nothing else can give light like that there's nothing can do it any artificial light burns out a little bit and bubs and everything else but that never fails for it's a spoken word of god made manifest little denominational creeds of bust above and blow a bubble and knock a fuse and everything else amen but the word of god shall never fail it'll be itself always the word i'm praying i'm going to run over time a little bit you're uh it's all right go ahead and finish this message all right rise and shine for the light has come to you the word light is vindicated the only way as god was jesus christ was the manifestation of god's spoken word the light of the hour john the baptist was the light of the hour he was the light before jesus was light the prophet isaiah said a voice upon crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord and make straight his path that was a spoken word of god he was laying there he hadn't come to life yet malachi the last prophet 400 years before taking place he said behold i send my messenger before me to prepare the way of the lord here comes all the wilderness without the nomination lock creed without identification but his light identified him the word identified him they said are you the messiah said i'm not but i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord jesus said you did walk in his light he was a bright and shining light for a while well until the wave was prepared then his light went out amen you can't walk in that light you baptist amen this is a lot of the hour the light has come rise and shine the word light word the manifested word of god have been identified is a light now what about the new year that we're facing could have more to say on this in between from the darkness to the light the introducing of the light coming between but now we won't get right straight to the new year all right new year new year what about it brings new hope we're one year closer we're one day kosher was yesterday where one hour closer it was when i started 15 15 minutes to 11 15 or 12 now we're one hour closer we don't look back we look forward see oh yes sir new year doesn't mean turning a new page no like the man one morning i was hurting a man got up early went out picked up the paper come back sit down put his feet up onto the van put his glasses on begin to read the paper his wife out getting breakfast she said john anything new he said nope same old thing just new people that's right murders rape somebody else done it true not turn a new page let's turn to the word see what the word promises for today see what the light of the day is supposed to be what we ought to do this year is not go back to creeds and things go back to your old denominations not go back to old denominations but turn to the word see what kind of light's supposed to shine today oh church turn to the word get back to the word flip the right switch quit punching around on electric lights see artificial man-made turn to his word and see the promise of today and then see what the promise is and what's for its identification when it's vindicated then you know where you're in light or not see what the promise is changing the pages or changing calendars doesn't change time amen a lot of people say well the whole year's gone throw away the old december caller now put up the other one a new year that's that's what new year's means to them to me i want to see what's promised for today i want to know what the light of the hour is so i know how to walk in it i want to know where i'm living what age i'm in how far up the road am i as paul said i can stand quoting in forgetting those things are in the past now i press towards the mark the high calling to the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when jesus comes do as david did put your future into his hands don't look to anything else but put your david said here he said uh said my time is in his hands you notice here in the psalms where we read it in 62 my time is in his hand he is my rock amen what is he he is revealed to me amen my time belongs to him i am his i'm in his hand because he holds the time amen i don't know what the future holds but i know he holds the future amen so he who holds the future holds me amen so why should i think about setting forth this for the new year i just put myself in his hands walk like david did my time is in his hand knew that god helped the future david didn't know what the future was but he knowed god had the future i don't know what the future is none of us do but we know he holds the future patience patience some of us get so um some of us gets in such a hurry i think a manny a good man has done that you're getting too mad too much of a hurry you want to see you don't do it yourself and minister brethren you know the way i'm talking you just listen to this tape i'm talking to you not only the little congregation here but man around the world many man go out impatient but believing at the time is near you try to do something within yourself wait upon the law patience is virtue if you can have patience it's virtue it's virtue if you they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength not they that try to get ahead of the lord they to try to tell the lord lord i know you want me to do this and glory to god don't do that wait upon the lord the bible said they that way upon the lord shall renew their strength god took thousands of years to fulfill his promise of a coming savior but remember he knowed it all time when it's coming there were many people rose up and tried to be messiahs many churches try to produce messiahs but god had the time set for his messiah he was no hurry in during the time of this he showed many types of messiah he showed it all away from adam to the messiah first and last adam one of them of the world netherlands of heaven one earthly and the other in heavenly one come down from heaven the other come off the earth but promised a messiah he took thousands of years to fulfill it showed joseph exactly what he was joseph pro-trading david portrayed him when david was a rejected king went up on top the hill and looked back and went over jerusalem as a rejected king that was jesus and david 800 years later stood up on jerusalem as a rejected king said jerusalem jerusalem how often i've hovered you as a hen doesn't brew but you would not look at joseph born among his brother in the patriarchs not the last one next to the last one benjamin was the last one but just before the last just before hated of his brothers loved of his father he was hated because he was a spiritual man he could interpret dreams they were exactly right amen he could see visions foretell things that would happen and they hated him amen he was sold for 30 pieces of silver what did they hate jesus for they called him beelzebub because he was the word and the word can discern the thoughts that's in the heart they hated him and they sold him for 30 pieces of silver he was stole into a pit joseph was supposedly to be dead his bloody coat was left behind like jesus bloody garment that was taken up from the cross the robe that he wore to identify his death but what did god do to joseph he brought him up out of the pit set him at the right hand of pharaoh and no man could see pharaoh only see joseph and when joseph left the palace trump explode amen and the proclamation went for every knee bow joseph is approaching same thing jesus he was taken from the pit supposedly before he was dead and raised up and sets at the right hand of the majesty no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father and when he leaves there the trumpets will sound and every knee shall power and every tongue shall confess he's a prince of prosperity look what egypt done then it saved the whole world drought come on so so will it be at the coming of the son of man the knee ever knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to him being he was all showed in times but god knew exactly when he would come amen he knowed exactly when he come no matter how many they had before that he had his messiah he showed him in types what was coming just exactly like he showed us the seven church ages what would come just exactly what he showed us what would come when he set that light up there in revelation to it to show the world when he sent the seven angels to reveal the seven messengers had been down there and show the loose ends each angel coming each day and revealing the loose ends of luther left and wesley left and pentecost left is all represented in there and in the very type and shadow of the great shalom amen jehovah yahweh exactly thought it in the skies and there's a mechanical eye taking a picture of it thank the lord shalom peace don't be wary jesus is here this great life has come to us and we're thankful for it yes his word the great mystery here he is today manifest himself doing the same as he did then just the same doing the very same thing we are creatures of time he's god of eternity we try to press ourselves we try to make something different oh this has got to be done remember he knows all about it it's going to happen anyhow amen let him do it just commit yourself to him look up and shine the joy of the lord to know that you've been privileged your eyes to come open and see this day trust in him for the future you've seen him vindicate his word in days past he that vindicated his word in days past and made all these other things happen just exactly to the hour that we're living everything exactly to the seventh angels message both showed it in heaven on earth and made it made known three ways so there can't be no step up remember he promised he had come again amen hallelujah that word will be a vindicated amen god's promised were but 2 000 years of waiting he will arrive on time don't be wary you'll be here as he has vindicated his word in every age the church ages showed the same thing and then revealing it all over the seventh message and so forth god revealed it amen amen manifested and it proved it amen and and among us today he showed himself here with us and proved and have vindicated his word so will he there will be a millennium amen the old will be young there forever sickness will fade away and death will be no more amen they shall build houses they will inhabit them they'll plant vineyards and eat the fruit there they'll not plant in another inhabit his son take it his son will be living by him he'll not play in another eats now often somebody else take it but he'll live there amen that glorious image of the son of god which is immortal years can never touch him age can never do anything to him he's the immortal son of god amen so we know that we're at the end time we're at the junction all these things thoroughly identified so will it be identified again now the future he holds it how do i know when he's coming when is he coming i don't know but he'll be here amen will he do thus this hand will the curse go off the earth when are these blessed uh reflections of god's love of trees standing here and shining out in the flowers and things when will they immortal grow i don't know but they will allow the reflection of man's hearts designed to live in hospitals and doctors and operations and crying and grief why would it all cease the glorious reign with jesus of a thousand years of shalom when would it i don't know he said it would be there i don't know how he's gonna do it but his spoken word will be vindicated when the son of righteous arrives with healing in his wings and the healing part there will not be a physical healing as you think as saying somebody's got the sickness that will be taken away from that's what he's doing now and type but the whole creature will be changed this mortal take on immortality this old age will jump into youth amen amen how will it be i don't know but it'll be there i'm getting all myself this year if the lord lets me live see sixth of april i'll be 55 years old an old man but i'm not looking i don't want to go back to be a boy again i want to press towards that marketer what purpose i came for about 30 something years now i've stood behind this desk from a little boy 20 something years old about 21 22 years old i tried to proclaim this message and every ounce of my strength i put to it then my shoulder stoop my hair turns green falls out i don't look back to that it'd come to it again amen i'm looking younger to the break of a day where the vindicated word of god said not one hair your head shall perish and i'll raise it up again at the last days how's he gonna do it i don't know but i trust the new year i don't know what it holds but i know he holds it amen that's the hopes of new year i have if he comes amen amen if he doesn't come i'll still be working if he spares me i just trust the future of him i don't know what it is i was trusted to him you've seen him have indicated his word so you know it's going to be done his word praise the lord amen let's take a look at our questions here we'll go through this in review first question what does the moon represent amen so let's go to paragraph 78. paragraph 78 is on page 16. i'm going to read for just a little bit here most of this page or i believe all of this page let's what does the moon represent now when we find out that after king shalom was come from the city then creed took it over later and it's constantly been creed but it represents the old church and we're taught in the new testament don't fail to get this in the new testament that we are not of this city jerusalem on earth but we are from the new jerusalem above so this must be the moon jerusalem not the new jerusalem above so the moon represents the church earthly so this is important to note because the moon represents the church earthly because the heavenly church will not be blackened out but it's the church earthly that's blackened out and goes into apostasy so brother branham is always through the church age addressing two vines that's running together two churches that's together amen there's a heavenly church and an earthly church a carnal church and a spiritual church together that's why when brother branham was drawing the symbols of the moon there was darkness and light in each age because those two vines were running together amen but at some point there's going to be a separation when the light comes and the church earthly goes into complete darkness but the bride the elect does not go into complete darkness that's the earthly church going to complete darkness and at that time that it moves into complete blackout the bride is pulled out into the new day the bright shining light of a new day she does not go into apostasy and she does not go into darkness hallelujah all around us total darkness but inside of us arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee the breaking of a new day where and the bride hallelujah i love that so it makes it really clear right here that we're not from jerusalem earthly which is the natural church we're from new jerusalem which is above but we up until the last age it was mixed together but in the last age when the light come it separated it out and one went into total blackout and one went into the new day i can never say that enough it gets more exciting every time we say that all right paragraph 79 and isn't it strange that just before the pope took his journey to jerusalem that the moon and the heavens made a total blackout just a few days before he took his journey he comes here also you know see now that's never been known see but what does it show that this he's doing this to win fellowship as he met on the day after he come into jerusalem he met the greek orthodox hierarchy and what does that reflect fellowship they're wanting protestant catholicism joining together which they are doing and will completely do and god reflected this to us in the moon of a total blackout by his mercy and grace he's showing is i believe it was the end of december at the end of december and then there was a there was a blackout and it made the headlines in the papers and they showed the phases of the moon many of you have seen that picture they show the phase and they show six pictures six phases of the moon but not a seventh because the seventh is totally blacked out and so that's what brother branham's referring to and that happened just before the pope went to jerusalem verse a paragraph 80. did any of you see the paper where they took the pictures of the moon i have it here if it ain't a perfect image leaving out the seventh age which is not yet exactly the way i drawed it by the holy spirit the church ages there's the six of them the seventh is not finished yet the six conditions of the moon now in its brightness in the first church age darkened the second third fourth fifth sixth just the way the holy spirit let me draw them on the board and then identified them with his self on the wall of the tabernacle two years ago the moon reflects itself and science again picks up the picture of the church ages just as they picked up that light yonder and put it in life magazine of the opening of the seals of the revealing in the age of the seventh angel in the days of his ministry the seventh messenger the mysteries of god which all the mysteries has been along the ages should be revealed and made manifest it should be at that time and he did it his words don't fail isn't that a mysterious thing god drawing in the heavens the same thing that they hold some same god let me draw on the blackboard and then by himself that's three times he's perfectly identified it and just before the pope goes to jerusalem so when brother branham preached the church ages in the revelation of jesus christ series on the blackboard he drew those seven circles and he drew the various light and degrees as it fades out and comes back but then when he was done with that god moved the the pillar of fire moved to the back of the church and on the back wall of the church it flashed out the same thing that brother brenham had drawn on the board and then now it shows it in heavens through an eclipse of the moon only when god showed it in heaven in the clips of the moon at first it looks like they leave out the seventh and brother branham says that but later in all the other messages he said the seventh was totally blacked out it was there but you couldn't see it because it was a total blackout showing that the significance of the pope going to jerusalem trying to unite the eastern and western side trying to unite protestantism and catholicism showing that the church has now gone into total apostasy it's completely blacked out so so when god showed it in the heavens it was even different than brother branham showed on the board because when he showed it he showed a little light left in the church when god showed it he showed it was time now for the separation total blackout praise be to god verse paragraph 81 which that was the church the moon is the church represents the church and before the church the shadow of the world crosses the moon and the shadow of worldlyism is the shadow of worldliness worldly churches swept across to black out the entire light of the bible so what brother brahma is showing is the eclipse of the moon is actually the earth getting between the sun and the moon the moon was put there to reflect the light of the sun but when the earth moves in between it it cast a shadow and that was the picture of the eclipse that was shown in the newspaper and brother bram said when it's totally blacked out it's because the world completely covers the church the church is completely blacked out in worldliness and worldlyism amen and no longer reflecting the light of the sun which is the word worldlyism the shadow of worldlyness worldly churches swept across to black out the entire light of the bible the world got in the light of the reflection do you understand the world crossed in the light of the moon and blinded out the sun and the reflection of the moon that's supposed to be giving light to the earth it was blacked out and it come in and draw the pictures just exactly like it did by inspiration before it happened let's turn the page and go over to paragraph 94 page 18 gross darkness blinding of israel for the lighting of the gentiles now the blinding of the gentiles is the lighting of israel it's just like the day and night one side gets darkness the other side gets light when the light comes over on the other side so the moon passing the way it did in the reflection of the darkness of the world blinding out its light is a reflection to us that the gentile church age is finished praise god the gentile church age is finished the church is making herself ready been making herself ready for a time it's time for the rapture amen praise the lord that's what that blackout means amen so that's what the moon represents so a lot of times the moon we say means the church we've got to we got to realize that moon represents the earthly church not the new jerusalem church because the new jerusalem church amen there's another scripture for her and that day the moon will shine at seven the moon will shine as the sun and the sun will shine seven times it's brightness so the moon is shining just like the sun and the sun in that time is shining and a seven-fold light of all the light of the seven churches put together and the moon is shining like the sun the full light comes to the church of the new jerusalem amen it's amazing brother venom is showing that the church goes in the total blackout total darkness but he's preaching shalom good morning gross darkness total darkness total possibly total blackout so he's he's not the reason he's preaching the message is shalom the message is not blackouts the message is not apostasy the message is not eclipsed the message is shalom so he's not trying to get you to the to be partaker in the blackout he's trying to get you to be a partaker in the shalom the good morning we're not part of the apostasy we're not part of the blackout we're not part of the gross darkness we're part of the good morning that's what this message is about because this message is to the elect and to the elect it's shalom praise god why is the church in darkness let's go back to page 17 and read paragraph 85 and 86 see before he went to jerusalem to block out its light or what access it does have what time position and what rights it has to shine now it's cutting it off altogether for the last age the seventh church age where she goes into darkness what a great thing the lord is telling us in everything it's never failed but what god in the heaven has declared it and told it looked to it and there has identified it and vindicated it that it is the absolute truth darkness this laodicean church age now when jesus which is the word in the laodicean church age was on the outside of the church knocking at the door trying to get in darkness gross darkness upon this people was the bible right they said amen when brother ben is showing if we could go and turn in our bibles to revelation chapter three if you could grab your bible and go to revelation chapter 3. and in chapter 3 verse 14 is going to bring in the laodicean church age and in the beginning of the laodicean church age he writes unto the angel the church of the laodiceans right but when we come to the end of the laodicean church age in verse 20 it says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me and brother man takes the scripture and shows and says see at the end of the laodicean church age jesus christ is on the outside of the church knocking that's why they're in darkness because christ the word is not there there's no light there it's total darkness because at the end of the age he's on the outside of the church and docking that's how brother branham shows us those scriptures now let's turn the page over to page 18 or sorry 19. let's read paragraph 96. what is light the vindicated spoken word of god outside of that there's no light see you can't lighten the earth with flashlights it takes god's word that's made manifest the sun and brother branham is referring uh brother branham is referring back to when god spoke the word and said let there be light but he said it wasn't light until the light come into manifestation it was spoken word but when it comes to manifestation it became light and there's been the word but when the word comes in the manifestation it's the light amen and when the church refuses that light and puts that light on the outside it is now in total darkness amen amen and that goes with our next question paragraph 96 also what is the light to the church amen what is the light to the church let's let's read paragraph 70. let's go back to page 14. this is what i was just referring to the son is the word of god in the beginning god said let there be light and when the manifested word of god when the word of god was manifested there was light first god spoke it what if it didn't manifest then it wasn't light yet but when he spoke it and then it was manifested vindicated his word was a vindicated light came into existence so it's a very simple principle he's showing when he spoke it it wasn't the light yet but when it come to manifestation then it became the light so when isaiah said a virgin shall conceive amen it wasn't the light of the age yet but when mary conceived that became the light of the age now to reject that manifestation is to reject light amen this is the condemnation of the earth that light has come and men have loved darkness more than the light because jesus christ amen the it was a virgin shall conceive wasn't the light the virgin shall conceive was laying there so that when it came into manifestation that became the light so the the bible has prophesied of this day of a bride without spot or wrinkle a holy habitation of god a temple built out to be the tabernacle of the whole the temple of the holy ghost as prophesied of this day amen and when it comes to manifestation in the people on earth that's the light amen simple it's a simple concept but it's so super profound let's turn to page 17 paragraph 87 the perfection of the scripture glory of his great name the pope's visit was a sign of the church they just blackened out the manifested light of the world was the bible jesus said he was the light of the world the bible said that he is the word and the manifested or the vindicated scripture is the light we got it amen we got it let's turn over to page 21. it's going to be another lengthy reading but i want to read through this carefully uh let's start at paragraph 111 page 21. now i say to the church shalom god's peace peace every true hebrew now he he has spent all of his sermon till now showing gross darkness showing apostasy black out of the moon but now he's turning now he says he's really getting to his message to the church and his message to the elect lady is shalom peace every true hebrew when he meets one another shalom other words good morning god be with you god's peace go with you it's a good morning how do you do it's breaking day church it's darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church christ is appearing among us hallelujah shalom peace hallelujah shalom when we see darkness settling darkness just before day we know that the morning star is hanging yonder to introduce the coming sun it's that's when the morning star shines it's the going between it's always dark as just a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day is because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning shalom that's him among us his word being identified shalom the great day is fixing to break when the morning breaks eternal bright and fair when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky when the role is called up yonder i'll be there our names are on his book we'll be there shalom good morning peace unto you the darkness is separating itself from the light god's causing it the light's doing it you realize the light is what's pressing the darkness but the baptism says another place the darkness is congealing itself together or it's condensing itself together and he says we'll read it here in a minute he says the darkness is darkening it's becoming darker what's doing it the light's doing it so so in jesus day when that light come amen the old church order the darkness darkened to persecute jesus christ the darkness darkness because the light was pressing it together the light was pressing pharisees and sadducees and herodians together amen and in the day that brother branham was here shining the light they started the ecumenical council while brother branham was here they started the world council of churches while he was in his ministry and they started the ecumenical move in vatican 2. why because he was a shining light and that light was pressing the protestant catholics together and now there's a bright shining light on the earth it's christ in the form of his bride and as that begins to shine brighter and brighter it'll move the darkness closer and closer together and we will see more and more alignment between protestants and catholics and churches coming together and when you see darkness darkening and you see the churches combining themselves together and more of a fellowship you know it's because you're shining the light because it's the light that's doing it amen the darkness is being pushed because of the light darkness is separating itself we're in paragraph 114 darkness is separating itself from the light god's causing it the lights doing him see the lights pressing itself in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together they had a chance to accept it and they wouldn't do it so it's condensed itself and they do that by putting the church together in the council of churches and uniting it with pagan darkness when they so firmly disagree with one another but yet they had to go together to make the night come upon the people isaiah 61 says arise and shine for the light has come to you rise and shine the light has come the word light is vindicated again the light vindicated again god's word so that you can see god manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age see this these promises that's made for this day these promises that was said by the prophets and by jesus himself in this day god and sunday times hebrew one god in sunday times in diverse manners spake to their fathers through the prophets but in the last days through his son jesus christ are we in the last days then how will he speak through his son jesus christ who is the revealed word for the age who's been spoken where it's becoming life in a bride the great light that hung in the wilderness which was that moses forsook egypt esteemed the reproach of christ greater treasure than that of egypt the same one that met saul on the road to damascus a great light hung before him that same light same pillar of fire saul being a hebrew would never worship any spirit or anything or call it lord in the position he was in he said lord who are you he said i'm jesus jesus said i come from god and i go to god what was that light he said i'm jesus now brother ben is referring to that same light the one moses met the one who led the children in egypt and the exodus the one that paul met on the road to damascus and now he says that same light has come and that light is who jesus that same light has come to what to manifest to make known to the people the promises that he's made for this day manifested light of the day the darkness is darkened when he come he was the light of the day there was supposed to come a messiah and he come just exactly like god said he did would come and when he did what was he the light of the day and it pressed the darkness so against him sees that right he had to give his life that the light continued could shine he was the light of the day but why why was he the light of the day he was the vindicated word that had been spoken made manifest so what made him the light of the day he was the vindicated word that had been spoken made manifest so the light of the day is the vindicated word that's been spoken made manifest hallelujah friends that should make us all excited that's why the scripture says arise and shine who you for thy light has come god said over this dark gloomy dismal mossy world that stood here without light he said let there be light and it wasn't light until the word was manifest then it was light so the word made manifest is light let's go down to paragraph 124 they said we know not whence thou comest we are moses disciples he said if you were moses disciples you would know me for moses wrote of me see he was the manifestation he was the vindication of the spoken word of god by moses and today that we're now living in god has come on the scene to vindicate and prove his promises so it's the light of the hour so we can rise and shine so why did the word come and get vindicated it came to be the light of the hour so we can rise and shine amen the light shines upon us again today the word is being made manifest it's the light praise be the god let's go down here to the bottom of the paragraph 135 you can walk in that light you can't walk in that light you baptist he's referring back to john the baptist this is the light of the hour the light has come rise and shine the word light word the manifested word of god identified is a light so you see the theme brother branham is bringing he's telling us what the light is but the light is not in the church anymore because the moon the earthly churches went into total apostasy now the light has gone into the bride the elect lady all right what does the morning star testify of this is interesting in here and i want to look at this for a minute if we can back up to paragraph 112. on page 21. we'll catch this just real briefly here page 21 paragraph 112. when we see darkness settling darkness just before day we know that the morning star is hanging on or to introduce the coming sun so the morning star introducing the coming sun that it's when it's that's when the morning star shines it's the going between between what between night and day between dark and light the morning stars the going between it's always darkest just a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkness before day is because the light is pressing the darkness so the blackout comes the moon fails to shine when's the moon fail to shine at the end of the legacy in church age the moon fails to shine that's when the morning star has to arise to let to introduce the morning the darkest before day is because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning shalom who's preaching this message who's saying good morning shalom the morning star the one representing the morning star because we're going to find out the morning star is christ but it's christ in the forerunner but the morning star comes out and says good morning shalom that's him among us who's that the morning star that's him among us his word being identified shalom the great day is fixing to break when the morning breaks eternal bright and fair now let's go over here to paragraph 132 on page 23. now john the baptist was the light of the hour he was the light before jesus was the light he was the light before jesus was light so what was he he was a forerunner he was a forerunner light showing that a greater light was coming and when that greater light come he had to diminish so so that the greater light could rise sounds like something brother branham said amen let's look at paragraph 136 down here now what about the new year that we're facing we could have more to say on this in between from darkness to light to introducing the light coming between but now we want to get right straight to the new year so now when when the moon fails to shine which was shown in an eclipse of the moon when the pope went to jerusalem because jerusalem represents the church the pope going to the old church represents the church going into complete apostasy blacked out on the moon no more light now in the in between between darkness and light between night and day there has to be a morning star come up or a forerunner light and what is the morning star it's him among us it was jesus christ working through the prophet but remember when brother eugene braun was here he said in jesus day you had the forerunner and the thing that he four run came in two separate vessels but in brother branham's day the forerunner and the thing he would forerun was the coming of the bride to maturity happened in the same vessel because brother branham was not just malachi 4 he was not just elijah the forerunner for running before running a second coming he was also the wave chief of the thing he four ran which was the bride coming in the maturity the first part of the harvest to come to full maturity happened it was the word coming to maturity but the word came to maturity in that same vessel and it was plucked up and waved before the people right so the the morningstar light was showing the light that was coming in the wave sheath good morning the morning star said good morning shalom brother branham come and preach good morning shalom showing where the morning star was and what's he announcing he's announcing the morning the sun's coming up that's what should make us so happy because we've seen the morning star that means the sun's come up that means this is a new day that means arise and shine for thy light has come the glory of the lord has risen upon thee amen all right let's go to this this is a quick one this last one what did they hate jesus for let's go paragraph 154. on page 26 paragraph 154 it says what did they hate jesus for they called him beelzebub because he was the word and the word can discern the thoughts that's in the heart they hated him why did they hate jesus because he was the word if he was the word then she has to be the the word so he said if the if the bridegroom was the word the bride has to be the word if he was the word they hated him then if she comes she has to be the word then if she's the word they hate her why because the word can discern the thoughts and intents that's in the heart because the word is exposing the corruption of the whole system the word was exposing the false religion the world the word was exposing amen that those religious leaders were white sepulchers they had dead men's bones on the inside that there was no life in that system and jesus was demonstrating and exposing the system what do you think the bride's been called to do the same thing expose that system and when god begins to rise up and more manifestation her to expose that system what do you think the religious world is going to think about that amen amen because the word can cut to the moral and the bone and separate and show the fallacy who else knows who else on the earth knows where the apostasy is who else knows where the false you know the church went in the blackout who else knows who else can expose it all praise god i want to make one other little point here if you could turn with me to paragraph 146 on page 25. this is one thing i want to emphasize it wasn't one of the questions i had but i want to emphasize it before we part you know we we talked about and and i've been sharing with you some of my burden and what i've been sensing and feeling and also that god has been doing some some things among us some supernatural things among us i i sit in a vantage point where i get to hear you know people having dreams and things that are happening that are supernatural in their lives i've had some supernatural experiences from very acute experiences here in the last couple of weeks but when that begins to happen and we know what the prophet said is going to happen and we know what kind of manifestation should be in the bride i thought that would be a good time to read through this paragraph 146. patient patience some of us get so some of us gets in such a hurry i think a mini a good man has done that you get in too much of a hurry you want to see you want to do it yourself all right we read the quotes brother ben read some some of the quotes we know what's coming and we know what the bride must manifest well you've seen manifest temporarily she'll be manifesting the fullness of its power but i think this is a good thing to hold in our minds right now i think this should be posted on our refrigerators right now so that we're careful a minister brethren you know from when i'm talking you that's listening to this tape i'm not talking to you not only to the little congregation here but men around the world many men go out and patient but believing that the time is near you try to do something within yourself wait upon the lord patience is virtue you can have patience if you can have patience it's virtue now think about this virtue means what strength if you can have patience it's strength what makes you strong when you have patience if you can have patience it's virtue it's virtue if they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength what did he say strength wait upon the lord renew what virtue the same word they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength not they that try to get ahead of the lord they that tried to tell the lord lord i know you want me to do this and glory to god don't do that wait upon the lord the bible said they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength god took thousands of years to fulfill his promise of coming savior but remember he noted all the time when it was coming let's jump over to paragraph 160 on page 27. we are creatures of time he's god of eternity we try to press ourselves we try to make something different oh this has got to be done remember he knows all about it it's going to happen anyhow let him do it just commit yourself to him there you go god's going to do it every gift every manifestation everything the spirit's going to do he's going to do it he's got a time for it's going to happen what can you do just commit yourself to him just be consecrated be prayerful be dedicated and let god do what he's going to do but don't get ahead of time because at a time like this when we sense a transition and things spiritually are picking up that's a time that the devil would love to come in and bring fanaticism and start instead of the perfect he would like to get the somewhat perfect or are a little bit flawed so we begin to lose confidence in the gifts and begin to begin to lose confidence in the outpouring of the spirit and the gifts and the manifestations so this is the time just to be patient we all sense it things are changing things are happening but be patient so that when it happens it's exactly solid and right and builds faith because if if you start to say you know i had a dream and it means this and this and this and you tell a bunch of people and that never happens people just lost faith or the lord told me this and this and that doesn't happen what happens we lose faith so we've got to be careful that this is the time we're patient and when god does it it's exact it's solid it happens and then our faith increases up and up and up so this is a good time when we've heard all that we've heard preached and we feel what we're feeling this is a good time to remember what the prophet said god's going to do it when he do it does it it's a sure thing let's go to paragraph 158 right over here on page 26 bottom page 26. i just want to read this to you just exactly like he showed us the seven church ages what would come just exactly what he showed us what would come when he set that light up there in revelation to it to show the world when he sent the seven angels to reveal the seven messengers that had been down there through there and show the loose ends each angel coming each day and revealing the loose ends that luther left wesley left pentecost left and all represented in there and in the very type and shadow of the great shalom jehovah yahweh exactly throwed it in the skies and there's the mechanical eye taking a picture of it see thank the lord he's talking about the picture of the cloud over sunset mountain look what he says now shalom peace don't be weary jesus is here what did that show that showed that jesus is here the headship has come to the body when when brother bam took that picture and turned it to the right he said see it's our lord that's our lord up there don't be weary jesus is here his great light has come to us and we're thankful for it yes his word the great mystery here he is today manifesting himself doing the same as he did then just the same doing the very same thing don't worry what does that cloud represent the headship is here don't worry everything's ticking just right on time we sense it we feel it things are shifting he's bringing us higher but don't worry he's right on time you don't have to push we don't want the prod we don't the force just be patient if we can be patient it's virtue to us if we can be patient it's strength everything he said is going to happen do you believe that let's all stand musicians if you can come brother ben if you can make your way up let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for this day we ask lord that you would just move upon us in a mighty way let everything we've heard be manifest in us that all these things lord that that wasn't necessarily preached for that day that was preached for this day let it come into manifestation in us lord let us arise and shine for our light has come nor we see it lord the church is an apostasy the world is in gross darkness amen in the darkness is moving together lord god because your light is shining more and more god help us just to commit ourselves to you and surrender to you that you have a vessel
