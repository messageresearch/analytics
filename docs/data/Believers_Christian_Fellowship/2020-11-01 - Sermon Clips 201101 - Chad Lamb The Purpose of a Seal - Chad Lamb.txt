so the whole book is the book of life of the lamb the lamb's book of life it's all about eternal life it's all about the tree of life it's all about the word it's all about him he comes to get the book and the book is all about him all the contents in the book is him but when you look at the words in the book when you start to separate pieces of the body amen what are those those are the believers so what are the believers the believers are the word what is the word the word is him amen you are the book you're part of the book amen the book isn't paper the book is the life of the lamb amen it's christ as he comes down through it's christ in noah christ and moses christ and abraham christ and brother branham christ in you the hope of glory and if it's christ in you then you're the words in the book your name is in the book maybe not the name that you have now brother branham said but who you are your position your identity is found in this book and how does he call your name by revealing the mysteries and the revealing the mysteries is calling the name he didn't say chad they say bob then say mary what did he say he said what happened in the garden the reason for a blood sacrifice the reason jesus needed to be born virgin was because of adultery in the garden and you said that's true what's he doing calling your name what's your name your identification he's calling your identity because it's christ calling to christ it's the word calling to the word and the only thing that can call the word is the word the revealed word called the predestinated word for that day and the two are magnetized to come together some hear the doctrine of serpentine saying that's weird you heard the doctrine of serpent seed and even if you said that's weird something inside started turning and you may have said that's weird i don't know i've never heard that before but all of a sudden you get an uncomfortable feeling inside that this is might be true oh god help me i remember that feeling friend something in me my brain was saying no my heart was saying yes my intellect my reasoning my logic my training my teaching my past history my years in a in a formal church we're all saying no way no way no way but something inside began to pulsate and the heartbeat got stronger and stronger and the more i heard it the more i knew it was true until one day god just dropped a revelation in my heart and i said that's nothing but the truth what was he doing he was calling my name how is he calling my name he was revealing the mysteries of this book amen what was the mysteries of the book it's a book of redemption and then he's starting to show you how you got into the condition you're in and how you get out of the condition you're in because that's redemption you're in the condition you're in because you need redemption because of a fall but but redemption brings me back to the place i was intended to be and that's what this seven seal mystery is all about
