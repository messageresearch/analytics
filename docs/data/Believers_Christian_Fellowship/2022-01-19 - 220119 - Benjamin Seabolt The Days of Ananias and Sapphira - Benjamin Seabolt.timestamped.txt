[7:11] he said to make sure that you all knew
[7:13] that he has not abandoned us he will
[7:16] return
[7:18] said they're doing fine nobody else has
[7:21] got sick or anything like that
[7:23] sister angie is doing fine doing well
[7:26] and fully anticipate to be here sunday
[7:29] so we will all be happy for that
[7:33] if you have your bibles let's turn to
[7:37] acts chapter 5
[7:40] and we'll begin
[7:42] reading here in acts chapter 5.
[7:53] i take a topic tonight
[7:56] something i've been thinking on for a
[7:58] little while now but
[8:00] um i just want to take a topic here
[8:04] of the days
[8:05] of ananias and sapphira
[8:09] and you know brother branham spoke about
[8:11] them
[8:12] and uh we'll get to that here in just a
[8:14] little bit but
[8:16] there's a
[8:18] there's something surrounding this event
[8:20] and these two people that i want to tap
[8:23] into so let's do that here in acts
[8:26] chapter 5.
[8:30] so
[8:31] just prior to this for a context this is
[8:33] when the
[8:36] the early church went sold everything
[8:38] that they had and were giving it to the
[8:41] apostles to divvy out
[8:43] almost what we would consider common
[8:46] living
[8:47] and this is the context that this is
[8:49] taking in chapter 5 verse 1 it says
[8:52] but a certain man named ananias
[8:57] with safari his wife sold a possession
[9:01] and kept back part of the price
[9:04] and his wife also being privy to it and
[9:08] brought a certain part and laid it at
[9:10] the disciples feet god bless you as you
[9:12] would have your seats we'll continue
[9:15] reading
[9:18] but peter said
[9:20] ananias why
[9:23] hath satan filled thine heart to lie to
[9:26] the holy ghost
[9:27] and to keep back
[9:29] part of the price of the land
[9:32] while it remained was it not thine own
[9:34] and after it was sold was it not in thy
[9:37] own power
[9:39] why hast thou conceived this thing and
[9:41] thine heart thou hast not lied to men
[9:45] but unto god
[9:48] that is quite a statement because
[9:50] ananias is talking to peter
[9:52] and ananias was physically
[9:55] vocalizing words and they were being
[9:58] received into peter's ears
[10:01] so he was speaking to a man but peter
[10:03] says you've not lied to men
[10:06] you have lied to god
[10:10] and ananias hearing these words fell
[10:13] down and gave up the ghost and great
[10:16] fear came on all them that heard these
[10:17] things and the young man arose wound him
[10:21] up and carried him out and buried him
[10:23] and it was about the space of three
[10:25] hours after
[10:27] when his wife not knowing what was done
[10:29] came in and peter answered unto her
[10:32] tell me whether you sold the land for so
[10:34] much and she said yea
[10:37] for so much
[10:38] then peter said unto her
[10:40] how is it that ye have agreed together
[10:42] to tempt the spirit of the lord behold
[10:45] the feet of them which have buried thy
[10:47] husband are at the door and shall carry
[10:49] thee out
[10:51] then she fell down straightway at his
[10:53] feet and yielded up the ghost and the
[10:55] young men came in and found her dead and
[10:58] carried her for carrying her forth
[11:00] buried her by her husband
[11:03] and great fear came upon the church
[11:06] and upon as many as heard these things
[11:09] and by the hands of the apostles were
[11:11] many signs and wonders wrought among the
[11:13] people right amongst the people
[11:15] and they were all with one accord in
[11:17] solomon's porch
[11:19] and of the rest durst no man joined
[11:21] himself to them but the people magnified
[11:24] them and believers were the more added
[11:28] to the lord
[11:29] multitudes both of men and women
[11:33] in so much that they brought forth the
[11:36] sick into the streets and laid them on
[11:38] beds and couches that the that at the
[11:41] least the shadow of peter
[11:43] passing by might overshadow some of them
[11:46] there came also a multitude out of the
[11:48] city's roundabout unto jerusalem
[11:51] bringing sick folks and them which were
[11:54] vexed with unclean spirits and they were
[11:56] healed everyone
[11:59] so i think after we read this passage i
[12:01] think it is safe to say
[12:03] that this group here was not playing
[12:06] church
[12:08] there was consequences
[12:11] that were being immediately dealt out
[12:15] for somebody lying to the holy spirit
[12:19] but it's very easy to take this topic
[12:21] and preach this in a condescending way
[12:24] or a condemnation type of way and i want
[12:26] to get that out first this is not that
[12:29] type of message this is that's not what
[12:31] i have on my heart of you're going to
[12:33] die and go to hell if you don't try
[12:35] harder if you don't do better that's
[12:36] that's not what i'm after here
[12:39] that's that's not the point here
[12:41] i just want to pick up something out of
[12:44] this to see
[12:46] what we have a chance at as a people
[12:50] because what had happened here what had
[12:52] transpired is ananias and sapphire had
[12:54] came before peter and god had moved
[12:57] through peter to see the motive and
[13:00] objective of ananias and sapphira's art
[13:04] that can be very detrimental if you
[13:07] haven't given all of your heart
[13:11] but if you have given all of your heart
[13:14] why should that scare us
[13:18] why should it scare us for the holy
[13:20] ghost to be able to discern the motives
[13:23] and intents of our hearts what a
[13:25] privileged people we are to live in a
[13:27] day
[13:28] that the full word has come and with the
[13:32] fullness of the word
[13:34] is the capability to reveal the fullness
[13:37] of the heart there is no other age that
[13:40] stood in a position that we have stood
[13:42] in there's no other age that's had an
[13:43] opportunity to be the kind of people
[13:46] that we have an opportunity to be so
[13:48] this is not a message of if you have sin
[13:51] in your life you're going to fall over
[13:53] in church tonight
[13:54] this is not that type of message is the
[13:57] possibilities there yes the
[13:58] possibilities are there because god's a
[14:00] living god god's a real god god doesn't
[14:02] play church
[14:04] but the days of trying to pound people
[14:07] through legalizing methods into the
[14:09] image of the stature of a perfect man
[14:12] are
[14:12] gone
[14:13] we have that understanding this is not
[14:16] something that a legalistic approach is
[14:18] going to produce this is going to be
[14:20] something that the fullness of the word
[14:22] exposing the fullness of your heart is
[14:23] going to produce and that's the only
[14:25] possible way
[14:27] so there's nothing that i can say here
[14:28] tonight to
[14:30] you know try should we try harder yes we
[14:32] should try harder i think we should we
[14:34] can all raise our hands and say yes we
[14:36] should try harder should we do better
[14:37] yes we should do better i believe that
[14:39] but i don't believe in my heart of
[14:41] hearts that there's anybody setting here
[14:42] tonight that's willfully setting here
[14:44] with something sinful hiding in their
[14:47] heart that they do not want exposed are
[14:49] we making mistakes sure is there things
[14:51] in our lives that we're doing wrong no
[14:52] doubt but what is our desire what is our
[14:55] intent what is our motive what is our
[14:57] objective and that saints we have to
[15:00] realize is a privileged position to be
[15:02] in
[15:04] of all the billions of people on the
[15:05] face of this earth you find me what
[15:07] percentage has the desire and has a
[15:10] clear heart and a motive and objective
[15:12] before god to search me to try me see if
[15:16] there is anything unlike you
[15:18] that is not a human
[15:20] desire
[15:22] that is not even a religious desire that
[15:24] desire can only come from the spirit of
[15:27] almighty god
[15:28] and now not only do you have that desire
[15:31] but now there has come a word the person
[15:34] of the word himself in this day in this
[15:37] age to produce an opportunity that no
[15:39] other age is produced
[15:42] to not only have that desire
[15:44] but to be able to produce that
[15:47] in hybrid flesh
[15:49] that is astounding i think we should
[15:50] never take that for granted i think we
[15:52] should never underestimate what position
[15:55] and opportunity that we have
[15:58] but this was a position
[16:00] that
[16:01] ananias and sapphira had conspired
[16:03] together
[16:06] to deceive the church
[16:08] and if you look at it
[16:10] peter breaks this down so simply
[16:14] he just asked him what are you doing
[16:17] why would you do this
[16:20] you had something that was rightfully
[16:23] yours
[16:24] and there was nobody trying to make you
[16:26] even give that up
[16:28] there was no pressure to give that up
[16:30] this was something that was yours and we
[16:32] were all happy that it was yours there
[16:34] was no problems here
[16:36] but what they had done was they had
[16:38] taken something and in this case it was
[16:41] a house or a land
[16:43] and they were trying to exalt themselves
[16:47] up as brother branham says they were
[16:49] trying to jump higher than they lived
[16:53] they were trying to make themselves look
[16:56] more holy than what they really were
[16:58] they were trying in themselves to make
[17:00] themselves look
[17:02] more spiritual than what they actually
[17:03] were
[17:04] because there was nothing wrong with the
[17:06] position that they were in
[17:08] there was no decree from christ or the
[17:10] apostles that they'll have to go and
[17:12] sell everything that you have and give
[17:14] to the church this was something that
[17:16] the early church they just did as the
[17:18] spirit moved them
[17:20] this is something that god would lay it
[17:22] upon their heart and they didn't want to
[17:25] uh to have you know if you want to say
[17:27] echelons within the church so they just
[17:29] went and they sold these things and they
[17:32] would give it to the church for the
[17:33] common good of everybody
[17:36] but there was no pressure to do that
[17:38] this was a free will giving but ananias
[17:41] and sapphira they would put themselves
[17:43] in a situation to where they wanted
[17:48] they wanted the reputation that came
[17:54] with with somebody
[17:56] giving all
[17:59] they wanted to be in that group
[18:02] of spiritual people
[18:04] that had
[18:06] truly given all
[18:07] even down to their physical possessions
[18:10] there was a group of people literally
[18:12] doing that and they wanted to to be
[18:14] identified with that
[18:19] so they would come
[18:21] and they would say
[18:23] we have given all as well
[18:26] knowing full well that they had
[18:29] that was the sin
[18:30] the sin was not that they
[18:32] sold the land or didn't sell the land or
[18:34] the price that it was sold for and how
[18:36] much they gave none of that was the
[18:37] issue
[18:39] there would have been no issue if they
[18:42] would have sold the land for 200
[18:45] and came before peter and said we sold
[18:47] it for 200 but we needed 150 to go buy
[18:51] whatever here's 50 of it praise god
[18:53] there's no problem the problem was they
[18:56] were trying to confess
[19:00] something other than what was that what
[19:02] they were really living in their hearts
[19:07] they were trying to confess
[19:10] that i have forsaken all
[19:13] and given it to christ
[19:16] when they really hadn't that was the
[19:18] problem that was the root problem
[19:25] peter says while it remained was it not
[19:27] your own
[19:31] your life is your life saints
[19:34] your body is your body
[19:36] it's been purchased by the blood of
[19:38] jesus christ but your life is your life
[19:40] you can do as you please you're on free
[19:42] moral agency
[19:44] jesus christ is not going to come down
[19:47] and force you to give him anything
[19:50] and there is nothing
[19:52] understand what i say when i say this
[19:54] but there is nothing
[19:56] wrong or i would say sinful
[20:00] in simply admitting the fact
[20:03] that this is the word and the standard
[20:05] and i can clearly see that and i am not
[20:07] living up to that
[20:09] but by his grace i want to
[20:13] but that's totally different when your
[20:16] profession and your confession is i've
[20:18] been buried in the name of the lord
[20:19] jesus christ in water baptism and i have
[20:21] given him my entire life his spirit is
[20:24] indwelling me
[20:25] and you knowingly continue to do things
[20:28] that the word is against that the nature
[20:31] of the word of against and this
[20:33] understand this is not shell shocking i
[20:35] think we would all agree with that
[20:36] this is not deep and mysterious this is
[20:39] just common common understanding
[20:43] but this is what affected the early
[20:46] church
[20:47] almost immediately after pentecost
[20:50] is there was still this make believer
[20:53] in that group
[20:57] but your life is your life he christ is
[21:00] not going to come and force you to do
[21:01] anything
[21:04] now if you're his seed
[21:06] he's going to make circumstances
[21:09] arise
[21:10] that will be beneficial to him
[21:13] and not beneficial to you hiding any
[21:15] part of your heart
[21:18] i think
[21:19] most of us have been there and
[21:20] experienced that
[21:23] but he is not going to come and force
[21:26] you to do anything
[21:27] because your own free moral agency and
[21:30] while you're in that state
[21:34] as peter says
[21:35] is it not your own
[21:37] is your thoughts not your own is your
[21:39] decisions not your own is your way not
[21:41] your own
[21:43] if you're going in your way
[21:45] and you're admitting this is my way this
[21:48] is what i want to do
[21:49] there is no sin lying in that
[21:52] i would say it this way there is there
[21:54] is no false confession laying in that
[21:57] but when you take on the name of the
[21:58] lord jesus christ in water baptism and
[22:00] you and you receive his holy spirit and
[22:02] you are declaring that the spirit of god
[22:05] the spirit of christ is indwelling me
[22:10] you can no longer move forward in your
[22:13] own desires
[22:14] without doing the same thing that
[22:15] ananias and sapphira did
[22:18] do we all agree with that
[22:20] while it remained was it not thine own
[22:23] and after it was sold was it not in
[22:24] thine own power why hast thou conceived
[22:27] this thing in thy heart why hast thou
[22:29] thou hast not lied unto men
[22:32] but unto god
[22:34] the same thing stands true tonight if
[22:36] you are in a cond if a person is in that
[22:39] type of condition the issue is not that
[22:41] they're false confessing something to me
[22:43] or you
[22:45] that's not the issue i have zero power
[22:48] to remedy that
[22:50] unless god would supernaturally reveal
[22:52] something to be called out i have zero
[22:54] power to do anything about that there is
[22:56] no issue with lying to me as a person
[23:00] but there is an issue with lying to the
[23:02] spirit of christ that is within the
[23:04] believers
[23:05] and there is an issue with linking
[23:07] yourself into that group as ananias and
[23:09] sapphira were doing falsely as one who
[23:12] has given all when they really haven't
[23:15] that's where the issue lays
[23:18] but i want to read what brother branham
[23:20] had to say about this
[23:23] in 1965 communion the very last message
[23:26] that he preached and this is where you
[23:28] want to say my thought or inspiration
[23:30] came from was out of this quote
[23:32] he says speaking of the communion except
[23:34] you eat the flesh of the son of man and
[23:36] drink his blood you have no life in you
[23:38] you see that's what the bible said
[23:40] except you do it there's no life
[23:43] you are then more or less showing you
[23:46] are ashamed to identify yourself as a
[23:48] christian because of the life that you
[23:50] live and then this is really the
[23:52] showdown
[23:53] then if you don't do it you have no life
[23:58] if you do it onward then unworthily you
[24:01] are guilty of the body of the lord
[24:05] same thing in water baptism if we say we
[24:07] believe on jesus christ he saved us from
[24:10] sin and we are baptized in the name of
[24:11] jesus christ we bring disgrace to him we
[24:14] do the things that's wrong and we'll
[24:17] have to pay for that
[24:19] now remember where he's placing this
[24:20] this is after you have declared the name
[24:22] of the lord jesus christ in your life
[24:24] he says to knowingly go against that and
[24:27] to go against that word and to do things
[24:29] that are contrary to that we will have
[24:31] to pay for that
[24:33] and another thing when we do that we are
[24:36] trying to profess one thing and do
[24:37] another that's the trouble of us today
[24:40] we believe that god has given us a
[24:42] message
[24:43] it's been ordained of god it's been
[24:45] proven of god it's been shown of god
[24:48] now we must come to him with reverence
[24:51] and with love and with purity of heart
[24:55] and mind and soul
[24:58] you know
[25:00] the hour will soon arise
[25:03] when right among us the holy spirit will
[25:05] speak out like it did in ananias and
[25:08] sapphira
[25:10] remember see
[25:11] that hour is coming
[25:15] now you just remember that see that god
[25:18] is going to dwell among his people
[25:22] that's what he wants to do now
[25:26] so brother branham in the last message
[25:28] that he that he preaches publicly
[25:31] is
[25:31] telling these people in this communion
[25:33] message it's not optional
[25:36] you have to take communion
[25:38] if you're professing the name of jesus
[25:40] christ
[25:41] you cannot decline that it's not a
[25:43] situation where you're unworthy and you
[25:45] just said it to the side he says if you
[25:47] do that there is no life in you we know
[25:48] this principle it's a scriptural
[25:50] principle we know it's not optional
[25:53] but brother branham says
[25:55] in his last message that there is going
[25:57] to come a time
[26:00] god is wanting to dwell in his people
[26:03] that's what he wants to do now he says
[26:06] and there's going to come a time you
[26:08] know the hour will soon arise right
[26:10] among us
[26:12] the holy spirit will speak out like it
[26:15] did in ananias and sapphira
[26:20] i believe
[26:21] that there is the possibility that this
[26:23] is a future event
[26:26] i believe this is also a current event
[26:29] but i also believe
[26:32] that this event was transpiring through
[26:34] the messages that brother branham was
[26:36] preaching
[26:37] because god wanting to dwell in his
[26:40] people requires as he just said requires
[26:43] reverence
[26:45] love
[26:46] purity of heart
[26:48] and mind and soul
[26:51] is that not the very purpose of the
[26:53] message coming to us
[26:56] so he's saying that these days are
[26:58] coming these situations are coming this
[27:00] hour is coming but what i don't want to
[27:03] happen is as us get under such
[27:06] expectation for somebody to walk into
[27:08] the church with hidden sin in their life
[27:10] and somebody to stand up and reveal that
[27:12] and that first person fall over dead
[27:15] number one if that's your motive and
[27:16] that and that's your objective and you
[27:18] think that's a good thing you got a
[27:20] problem
[27:22] jesus christ himself said i do not come
[27:24] to this world to destroy it i come to
[27:26] give life so if you would take any kind
[27:29] of joy or any kind of satisfaction with
[27:31] somebody number one having hidden sin in
[27:33] their life and coming into church
[27:36] and then falling over dead when that is
[27:38] revealed
[27:40] that is a wrong spirit
[27:43] christ's spirit is always for repentance
[27:46] an opportunity for repentance an
[27:48] opportunity to make things right so i am
[27:51] not against there being sin called out
[27:55] but i would pray and seek god and ask
[27:58] for mercy
[28:00] i do not want to see there being
[28:02] judgment dealt out
[28:04] i would cry for mercy because what if
[28:06] it's me
[28:10] it's fine and dandy when it's somebody
[28:12] else and it doesn't affect you but what
[28:13] if it's you
[28:15] would you not want somebody interceding
[28:17] for you would you not want an
[28:18] opportunity for repentance if something
[28:20] is called out
[28:22] but what i'm getting at here is this to
[28:25] me is not necessarily a future event
[28:28] but this is the very purpose of what the
[28:31] message has came to do
[28:33] it has came to give us that pureness of
[28:36] heart to give us that opportunity as the
[28:39] word is going forward to die to
[28:42] ourselves and have a pure heart when the
[28:45] word is going forth and sin is exposed
[28:47] in our life as we're sitting in church
[28:49] or as we're having a conversation with a
[28:51] brother or sister or as we're studying
[28:53] the message and reading our bible when
[28:55] that is revealed in our heart that this
[28:57] is not christ-like there is a there is a
[29:00] day of ananias and sapphira currently
[29:02] happening
[29:03] that sin is being called out that
[29:05] unbelief is being cut out but that
[29:07] opportunity for repentance is there
[29:10] when that hidden sin is exposed there is
[29:13] an opportunity for repentance
[29:15] why would it why would we wait and why
[29:18] would we put ourselves under a position
[29:21] when christ has revealed something to
[29:23] our heart from his word whether it's
[29:25] just by study or from a brother or
[29:27] sister or from the pulpit why would we
[29:30] wait and say well if he really means
[29:32] that he'll call it out by somebody
[29:35] brother randall says those days are
[29:37] coming and if it's really wrong well
[29:38] he'll get to it he'll call it out
[29:42] why not deal with it now
[29:45] why not deal with it now why tempt the
[29:48] lord
[29:48] why why possibly put yourself in the way
[29:51] of judgment
[29:53] see to me this is not when brother
[29:55] branham says that these that this hour
[29:57] will arise
[30:00] i do believe that he was saying that in
[30:02] the future but there is a people that
[30:05] are standing here now who have taken
[30:07] that message who has received that
[30:09] message who can make this a current
[30:11] event each and every day of their life
[30:14] so i would say that that day has come
[30:18] in 1965 that day was to arise
[30:22] but now i would say that day has come
[30:26] and i would say that we all want to take
[30:28] advantage of that day now
[30:31] and not let it go into a day of judgment
[30:34] because if we are his seed he is going
[30:36] to have his will
[30:39] but i would much rather fall on that
[30:41] stone and be broken
[30:43] than just be crushed to powder
[30:47] remember there's only two options
[30:49] neither one of them are pleasant neither
[30:50] one of them are going to feel good
[30:53] but i would much rather fall on the
[30:54] stone than be crushed to powder when it
[30:56] falls on me
[30:59] 1952 faith is faith in the son of god
[31:03] brother brandon says i want you to
[31:04] notice what faith taken place in
[31:06] jerusalem when people believed when they
[31:09] seen the article this is he's speaking
[31:11] immediately after ananias and sapphira
[31:13] was called out
[31:15] there just been a woman that came up and
[31:17] a man who went out and done something
[31:19] and came and thought that they could get
[31:21] by with it before the church they lied
[31:23] about it they said we sold our ground
[31:25] for so and so but there was a man
[31:27] standing there who was a prophet he said
[31:30] why has the devil put in your heart to
[31:32] lie to the holy ghost
[31:34] such a shock killed the man
[31:40] here come his wife sapphira he also told
[31:42] her the feet that packed your husband
[31:44] out i tell you when they seen that
[31:46] discerning that spirit moving and
[31:48] pointing to the person and telling who
[31:50] it was the critics hushed
[31:52] but today they're brazen
[31:55] right after the death of ananias and
[31:56] sapphira when peter pointed them out and
[31:58] told them what they had done the very
[32:01] condemnation to know that they were
[32:04] wrong
[32:05] shocked them till they died
[32:09] right there
[32:12] just think of that the holy spirit
[32:14] speaking said you've lied and you've
[32:16] done a certain thing and down they
[32:18] dropped
[32:21] the shock
[32:22] the condemnation of the holy spirit
[32:25] calling that thing out in their life
[32:26] brother branham says he says they died
[32:29] of a heart attack right there
[32:32] such a shock to their system they didn't
[32:35] have an opportunity to repent
[32:37] i pray they repented in their dying
[32:38] breaths
[32:40] but it still didn't stop
[32:42] the physical extreme shock to their body
[32:45] of the holy spirit revealing that
[32:48] that caused a physical death on them
[32:53] 1953 god's provided way he said peter
[32:56] and john were ignorant unlearned men
[32:58] the bible said they were absolutely
[33:00] ignorant but they had to take notice to
[33:01] them they'd been with jesus
[33:03] they had enough faith to heal a man at
[33:05] the gate called beautiful peter had
[33:07] enough power of god in him to tell
[33:09] ananias
[33:10] you are lying
[33:11] that's right you kept that money back
[33:14] and sapphire sapphira you did the same
[33:17] thing
[33:18] scared them so bad they had a heart
[33:21] attack and died
[33:22] and they packed them out and buried them
[33:24] amen that same god lives today
[33:28] that same program is god's program for
[33:31] today
[33:34] when he says that statement i don't
[33:36] believe that he's saying it's god's
[33:38] program for people to walk into the
[33:39] church and fall over dead when their sin
[33:41] is exposed i do not believe that is the
[33:43] will of god
[33:45] is it possible absolutely it was
[33:47] possible here at scriptural we cannot
[33:49] deny this
[33:50] it can get to this point
[33:53] but it doesn't have to
[33:55] and we have had a message come to keep
[33:58] us from this point we have had a message
[34:01] come that we can take this in the
[34:03] privacy of our own house and of our own
[34:06] rooms and our own pri
[34:07] prayer closet we can take this and
[34:10] examine our hearts to where this doesn't
[34:13] have to be the case
[34:15] it can be the case
[34:17] but it doesn't have to be the case
[34:20] so as i said when i started i don't want
[34:22] this to come across as a message of
[34:24] condemnation i don't want this to come
[34:26] across as a message of everybody getting
[34:27] scared
[34:29] we should be thankful
[34:33] we should be thankful we have this
[34:35] opportunity
[34:37] ananias and sapphira they didn't have
[34:39] what we have they didn't have the
[34:40] fullness of the word
[34:43] they
[34:44] they did not have
[34:47] a seven course meal laid out before them
[34:49] that they could go and examine their
[34:51] life
[34:53] they do they did not have the
[34:55] opportunity that we have but in this day
[34:57] in this age we have had christ himself
[35:01] come we have had the fullness of the
[35:04] word come himself to reveal the fullness
[35:08] of his nature
[35:09] so now ananias and sapphira and on all
[35:13] through the church ages they could walk
[35:15] in ignorance
[35:17] they could walk in ignorance and and
[35:19] there was there was
[35:20] honest ignorance if you would want to
[35:22] say it that way to where they would be
[35:24] walking in things that was not pleasing
[35:26] to the nature of god and they just
[35:28] simply wouldn't know it and there was
[35:30] nobody else there to call it out because
[35:31] they didn't know it either but now that
[35:34] has changed brother ram says now we've
[35:37] came to a free age
[35:40] and now the fullness of the word has
[35:42] come so that the entire nature of christ
[35:44] can be revealed to set us free from that
[35:47] that we do not have to walk scared in
[35:49] this position
[35:52] we do not have to enter the church
[35:55] with any fear in our lives we can check
[35:58] it by the message
[36:00] prior to coming to church we can check
[36:02] it each and every day
[36:04] what a privileged people we are
[36:06] so that's the point that i want to get
[36:08] to you it's it's not a message of if you
[36:11] mess up your
[36:12] you know you're going to be hurting
[36:14] or if you're hiding something you're
[36:15] going to be hurting it's not that type
[36:17] of message so you can relax a little bit
[36:19] it's not fire and brimstone yet
[36:22] but we we i want us to really grasp that
[36:26] what position do we stand in
[36:29] what opportunity do we have
[36:34] i assure you that ananias and sapphira
[36:36] would have longed for this opportunity
[36:39] forever
[36:40] longed
[36:42] to have the word revealed to them at
[36:44] such a point
[36:46] that they would have known
[36:48] i cannot get by with that that is silly
[36:50] to even think that way
[36:52] that is just dumb
[36:55] but there was nothing to prick that to
[36:57] them
[36:58] they learned it the hard way so to speak
[37:00] remember this was the church in its
[37:01] emphasis
[37:05] 1958
[37:07] before i go there i just want to back up
[37:08] for a second
[37:09] i want to prove this to you
[37:12] when i say the days of ananias and
[37:14] sapphira the point is not for dead
[37:16] people
[37:17] because if you recall we had these days
[37:19] in brother branham's ministry with
[37:22] brother way
[37:24] brother brandon says he was preaching he
[37:25] exposed that complex in his life and he
[37:28] said he resented me exposing that and he
[37:30] died of a
[37:32] heart attack
[37:35] repeat of scripture
[37:38] a shock hit him so bad he physically had
[37:41] a heart attack and died
[37:44] i'll just remind you that the prophet of
[37:46] god did not leave him laying there dead
[37:49] and i want to put it this way
[37:51] if the power of god would fall in this
[37:53] assembly and do what it did in the days
[37:55] of ananias and sapphira i don't want to
[37:58] be the one standing on the side saying
[37:59] it served them right
[38:01] i want to be the one laying there
[38:03] praying for them calling out for mercy
[38:06] calling for their life to come back if
[38:08] there's any way
[38:11] because i'm not above that i'm in hybrid
[38:13] flesh just like you are
[38:15] i'm human just like you are and that's
[38:18] the spirit and the objective that i want
[38:20] to operate with
[38:22] and it's the same way
[38:24] now we we recognize that in a mighty
[38:27] physical demonstration and a very
[38:28] specific demonstration
[38:31] but the same thing happens each and
[38:34] every service and each and every time we
[38:36] come in contact with the word when the
[38:38] word exposes something to us
[38:40] you may not fall physically dead
[38:43] but you can walk out of those church
[38:44] doors dead as a door now
[38:47] because you have rejected the word
[38:51] i don't want that to be the case either
[38:54] if the word of god is coming and i'm not
[38:56] getting it i want somebody to intercede
[38:58] for me and to cry out for me god help
[39:00] him to see it
[39:02] god help him to get it
[39:04] because we all know it's just a it's
[39:06] just a common understanding it is ten
[39:09] times easier for me to see something
[39:10] wrong in your life than it is to see it
[39:12] in my life
[39:13] and it's ten times easier for you to see
[39:15] something wrong in my life than it is in
[39:16] your own
[39:18] that's why iron sharpeneth iron
[39:21] and the purpose of sharpening iron is
[39:23] not to kill your brother or your sister
[39:25] the point is to be able to cut that
[39:27] thing away from your brother and sister
[39:28] without hurting them with the right
[39:30] motive with the right objective to allow
[39:33] the power and demonstration and purity
[39:36] and realness of the days of ananias and
[39:39] sapphira to return into the church with
[39:41] the right motive and with the right
[39:43] objective
[39:44] not for death
[39:47] not for death physical or spiritual
[39:50] not for suffering
[39:53] but so that that person can be free so
[39:56] that they can walk in a pureness of
[39:58] heart truly giving all things
[40:02] that's the point and that's the spirit
[40:04] that i want to operate by so do i want
[40:07] the days of ananias and sapphira to
[40:08] return to the church in its fullness
[40:10] absolutely
[40:12] with the right spirit
[40:13] and with the right motives
[40:16] 1958 by faith moses
[40:19] he says she's going to be destroyed he's
[40:21] speaking of america because god is just
[40:24] and if america gets by with her sins the
[40:27] just and sovereign holy god will be duty
[40:29] bound to resurrect sodom and gomorrah
[40:31] and apologize to them for burning them
[40:32] up because of their sin
[40:36] if he lets us get by with it
[40:40] if he lets you get get to heaven
[40:43] on your unjust works
[40:46] he'll have to raise up ananias and
[40:48] sapphire and give them another
[40:50] opportunity he certainly would but he's
[40:53] just ananias saw his money
[40:58] i want you to listen real close to this
[41:01] ananias saw his money
[41:05] peter saw christ
[41:08] oh my
[41:10] lot didn't see the destruction of his
[41:12] children in that place
[41:15] many of you today
[41:17] holding around these old creeds and
[41:20] things
[41:21] you don't see the juvenile the
[41:23] delinquency and the destruction of your
[41:26] children
[41:28] you don't see your daughter in a
[41:30] prostitute house you don't see your son
[41:32] a drunkard or at a card table somewhere
[41:40] see how important it is
[41:45] it went farther farther than ananias and
[41:47] sapphira
[41:49] ananias and sapphira no doubt how
[41:50] children had family had friends
[41:54] but brother branham is saying
[41:57] that ananias couldn't see anything
[41:59] besides his money his love for his money
[42:02] he couldn't see the end result
[42:05] he couldn't see himself ending up dead
[42:07] his wife ending up dead
[42:09] he says lot
[42:11] lot when he made his decision
[42:14] to go to sodom
[42:16] it looked good
[42:18] it looked like the better decision
[42:21] but he said when lot did that he
[42:23] couldn't see
[42:25] the effect that it was going to have on
[42:28] his children
[42:35] he says many people hanging under these
[42:36] old formal creeds and things they don't
[42:38] see the effect that's going to have on
[42:40] their daughters and on their sons
[42:43] turn their daughters into prostitutes
[42:45] turn let their sons be down at the at a
[42:48] drunkard or at the card table
[42:51] see the pureness of your heart has way
[42:54] more effect than just on
[42:56] you i'll say it this way
[43:00] the reality of truly giving all
[43:05] or not
[43:06] giving all
[43:08] has much more effect than just on you
[43:13] because you're going to go off of the
[43:15] scene one day
[43:17] but what effect is your life going to
[43:19] have on your children
[43:21] if you
[43:22] lived a life before them of being able
[43:25] to cover something up from the word of
[43:27] god
[43:28] not truly giving all to the word of god
[43:31] do not try to convince me that's not
[43:33] going to have an effect on your children
[43:38] i'm not scared of a lot of things
[43:41] at least i don't think i'm scared of a
[43:42] lot of things
[43:44] but i'll tell you one thing that
[43:46] terrifies me
[43:48] and that keeps me up praying at night
[43:51] and maybe being a parent just changed
[43:52] this for me but one thing that terrifies
[43:55] me
[43:56] is when i look into the eyes of them
[43:58] little boys
[44:00] knowing they've got to be born again
[44:04] or they're going to be lost
[44:07] knowing they have to have a rebirth
[44:09] knowing they have to have the fullness
[44:11] of their word knowing that they have to
[44:13] have christ
[44:16] and the thing that would terrify me
[44:18] is if me
[44:20] in my
[44:21] self-desires
[44:25] and my pridefulness
[44:28] would
[44:29] do something
[44:31] to not sacrifice everything that i am
[44:34] for this message
[44:35] and not give everything that i am for
[44:37] this word that has been presented my way
[44:42] if i would hold on to a job
[44:45] or a position
[44:46] that would keep me out of the house of
[44:48] god or that would keep my children out
[44:50] of the house of god
[44:51] i'm not talking about missing a service
[44:53] here or there or sickness or whatever a
[44:55] vacation i'm not talking about that i'm
[44:57] talking about knowingly entering into an
[44:59] occupation that you're going to have to
[45:01] give up the house of god
[45:04] don't think that's not going to affect
[45:06] your children
[45:07] you have just told your children
[45:10] occupation is more than being in the
[45:12] house of god i don't even try to tell me
[45:14] it's the will of god
[45:17] that is so simple i don't even have to
[45:18] pray about it if your occupation keeps
[45:21] you out of the house of god when it's
[45:22] open it's not the will of the lord for
[45:24] you to be there
[45:27] it's just not saints it doesn't require
[45:30] prayer that's priorities
[45:32] and again i'm don't take this fanatical
[45:34] i'm not talking if you've got to go to
[45:36] go to school on a weekend or on a
[45:37] wednesday temporarily or something
[45:39] temporarily that's not what i'm talking
[45:41] about i'm not talking fanaticism and i'm
[45:42] not talking legalism
[45:44] i'm talking examine your heart
[45:48] are you holding on to an occupation
[45:50] outside of the house of god
[45:54] and it doesn't have to be an occupation
[45:55] it can be anything it can be a hobby it
[45:57] can be family
[45:59] it can be anything
[46:02] but the point is don't think that you
[46:04] can hold a confession before your
[46:06] children or before the people that you
[46:08] associate with that i have given all
[46:12] and something just that simple
[46:14] declares that you haven't
[46:16] you will be spiritually dead you will be
[46:18] riding a black horse
[46:21] after you got off your red horse of
[46:22] defending why you had to keep that job
[46:24] or that occupation or that hobby or that
[46:26] schooling or whatever it is you're going
[46:28] to go from the white horse to the red
[46:30] horse to the black horse and find
[46:31] yourself just like ananias and sapphira
[46:33] spiritually dead
[46:36] confessing i've given all
[46:40] and in that simplicity your children is
[46:42] going to recognize that you didn't
[46:44] again that's just an elementary example
[46:48] but it's it's really that simple
[46:50] and that is something that
[46:55] again i don't take a legalistic approach
[46:57] to it
[46:58] it's not about legalism it's not about
[47:00] lining up to what i think or what i say
[47:03] i'm just saying examine your heart
[47:06] examine your heart
[47:09] what is more important
[47:10] what are young people what are you
[47:13] basing your life decisions around
[47:17] a salary of x amount of dollars
[47:21] to live in a certain location where it
[47:24] don't go from 40 to 15 degrees
[47:27] in a single day
[47:29] what are you basing
[47:31] your motives and your objective and your
[47:34] routes on your your life decisions on
[47:37] what are you basing that on what are you
[47:39] considering
[47:43] can you approach god and say
[47:45] i'm giving you everything
[47:48] you are my all in all all i want is you
[47:51] now you direct my paths
[47:54] or do you are you so focused
[47:57] on something you want to achieve and
[47:58] something you want to be
[48:00] a title you want to have tact to your
[48:02] name
[48:03] that you would forsake the word of god
[48:06] even in assembling yourself together
[48:08] that you would forfeit that to
[48:10] accomplish something carnally
[48:13] moving on
[48:16] it's really that simple
[48:19] it really is
[48:23] brother brandon says and i just want to
[48:25] read this one more time because this is
[48:27] this is really important i want us to
[48:29] remember that
[48:30] lot didn't see the destruction of his
[48:33] children when he made that decision
[48:39] let's consider that
[48:42] 1961 paradox
[48:44] he says and through his sacrificial
[48:46] death at calvary and his resurrection
[48:49] positionally placed his church in that
[48:51] realm that the same invisible god could
[48:53] come into the individual and make the
[48:55] word visible oh my
[48:57] i wish my church could get that
[49:00] i've often wanted to come into a church
[49:03] i've longed to see it
[49:06] i guess
[49:07] where i could walk in the door
[49:10] look across the audience and see a
[49:12] perfect church
[49:14] all in order sin could not stay there no
[49:18] the spirit call it out you see
[49:20] it just couldn't stay
[49:25] like ananias and sapphira you just
[49:28] couldn't do it there'll be no sin in
[49:31] that group no sir now see the spirit
[49:34] quickly speak it like that
[49:36] no matter what it was how little it
[49:39] would be done
[49:40] see women and men sitting there under
[49:42] the power of the holy spirit the spirit
[49:44] of god moving perfectly someone had done
[49:47] something wrong in the congregation they
[49:49] would come quickly confess it before
[49:51] them because they know right then it's
[49:53] going to be called that's the church of
[49:55] the living god
[49:57] how my old poor heart
[49:59] now it's getting old how i've longed to
[50:02] stand and see a church like that
[50:05] i may yet
[50:06] i hope to
[50:10] look at the desire that he's after here
[50:13] it's not for people to come into the
[50:14] church and fall over dead because they
[50:15] got sin in their life
[50:18] it's for a church to be setting in
[50:19] perfection
[50:21] and perfection is not meaning that they
[50:23] don't make mistakes perfection what he
[50:25] is saying here is he wants to come into
[50:27] a church to where there is pureness of
[50:29] heart
[50:33] and if there's not pureness of heart
[50:37] that the people that does have pure
[50:39] hearts would be able to identify it in
[50:41] people that don't have pure hearts
[50:43] and let them know
[50:46] that doesn't have to be before two or
[50:48] three people in fact it's unscriptural
[50:50] for it to be before two or three people
[50:51] before you go to that brother because
[50:53] the scripture teaches that if you have
[50:54] ought with the brother you've got to go
[50:56] to that brother first singly or that
[50:57] sister
[51:01] so if you think it's the will of god
[51:02] just to stand up and publicly declare it
[51:04] without going to that brother first if
[51:06] you have that opportunity you're wrong
[51:08] if you have the opportunity
[51:11] if you have the opportunity to speak to
[51:13] that person privately first you have to
[51:15] do it or you break the scripture
[51:17] you are out of the will of the lord if
[51:19] you publicly
[51:20] declare it
[51:21] before you go to that person first
[51:24] it's wrong it's against the principles
[51:25] that paul taught he says don't do it go
[51:28] to that person privately first
[51:31] and then if they don't hear you take a
[51:32] brother
[51:33] and then if they don't hear you declare
[51:35] it before the church
[51:39] brother bran says i long to see a church
[51:42] like that
[51:45] i long to see a church like that
[51:48] i long to see a church like that because
[51:50] i said before there's no doubt there are
[51:52] things in my life not that i know of god
[51:54] is my witness not that i know of
[51:56] but no doubt there are things in my life
[51:58] that i'm wrong in
[52:01] but until he reveals it to me i just
[52:02] don't know as the old saying is you
[52:04] don't know what you don't know
[52:06] but i want to know
[52:08] i want to know and i want to have the
[52:10] spirit of christ that when it's revealed
[52:12] i bring it into subjection to the word
[52:15] and if that comes across the pulpit
[52:17] praise the lord if it comes from my
[52:18] brothers and sisters in the assembly
[52:20] praise the lord if it call if it comes
[52:22] from the purple-haired lady of great
[52:24] greeting me at walmart praise the lord i
[52:26] don't care where it comes from
[52:29] i just want it to come and i want to
[52:31] subject myself to that whatever route it
[52:34] comes in
[52:38] i want to look at let's go to second
[52:40] kings
[52:49] second kings four
[52:56] i want to look at just a couple subjects
[52:59] that found themselves
[53:01] in not good positions
[53:06] because by the time we get to the end of
[53:08] this you're going to realize when
[53:09] brother brainer says that the days of
[53:11] ananias and sapphira are coming we're
[53:13] going to realize that the days of
[53:14] ananias since the fire started in
[53:16] genesis
[53:17] and ends in revelation
[53:20] second kings 4 25
[53:24] this is gaheza
[53:26] the servant of elisha
[53:29] he walked right beside elisha
[53:35] speaking of the shunamite woman it says
[53:37] so she went and came into the man of god
[53:40] to mount carmel
[53:42] this is right after her son died
[53:44] and it came to pass when the man of god
[53:47] elisha saw her afar off that he said to
[53:50] gehaza his servant behold yonder is that
[53:54] a might
[53:56] run now i pray thee to meet her and say
[53:58] unto her is it well with thee is it well
[54:00] with thy husband is it well with the
[54:02] child and she answered it as well
[54:06] and when she came to the man of god
[54:08] to the heel she caught him by the feet
[54:12] but gahesa came near to thrust her away
[54:15] and the man of god said let her alone
[54:18] for her soul is vexed within her and the
[54:21] lord hath hid it from me and hath not
[54:24] told me
[54:25] so here is geheza the man that was
[54:28] living with elisha walking with elisha
[54:31] sleeping with elisha eating with elisha
[54:34] everything elisha was doing he was doing
[54:40] and here comes the shunamite woman after
[54:42] she lost her son
[54:44] and she has a revelation if i can get to
[54:46] the man who gave me this son
[54:48] the god in the man that gave me this son
[54:51] if i can get to him all as well
[54:54] but there is something in gehese's
[54:56] character
[54:57] that when this woman comes and latches
[55:00] on to the feet of the only hope that she
[55:02] has he would try to thrust her away from
[55:05] that
[55:07] to the point that elisha would have to
[55:09] tell him don't do that
[55:11] let her alone
[55:14] the lord has hid something from me and
[55:16] she has came to reveal something to me
[55:19] that i might know how to handle this
[55:20] situation
[55:22] so you can see
[55:24] by this portion of scripture there's
[55:26] something tweaked in gehese's character
[55:29] there's something tweaked in gehese's
[55:32] character
[55:34] because
[55:36] if this was gehey's son that has died
[55:39] i don't think he would want somebody
[55:41] pulling him off of the prophet's feet
[55:43] so why would he do that to somebody else
[55:47] you see gehese has got himself lifted up
[55:49] in his position
[55:51] and he's now now because he's lifted up
[55:54] in his position he can't let anybody get
[55:57] between him and that prophet
[56:00] because it might affect his position
[56:02] so now when somebody comes and they
[56:04] thrust themselves in there needing help
[56:06] needing grace needing mercy needing
[56:08] healing
[56:10] he would come and try to pull them away
[56:12] from that
[56:22] something wrong with this character
[56:29] he says
[56:32] let's continue tracking this down this
[56:34] is in second kings five
[56:37] second kings 5 14 then went he down
[56:40] speaking of naaman
[56:42] then went he down and dipped himself
[56:45] seven times in jordan
[56:47] according to the saying of the man of
[56:49] god that's what elisha told him to do
[56:51] go dip in jordan seven times
[56:54] and his flesh came again like unto the
[56:56] flesh of a little child and he was clean
[57:00] and he returned to the man of god he and
[57:02] all his company and came and stood
[57:05] before him and he said behold now i know
[57:07] that there is no god in all of the earth
[57:10] but in israel now therefore i pray thee
[57:13] take a blessing of thy servant
[57:15] but he said
[57:17] as the lord liveth before whom i stand i
[57:20] will i will receive none
[57:22] and he urged him to take it
[57:25] but he refused
[57:26] so naaman is trying to give a gift to
[57:28] elisha he's trying to show thanksgiving
[57:32] it's honorable there's nothing wrong
[57:33] with that
[57:34] he's trying to give back because he's
[57:36] received something but elisha says
[57:38] that's not my portion i'm not taking
[57:39] anything
[57:40] thank you but no thank you
[57:42] and naaman said shall there not then i
[57:44] pray thee be given to thy servant two
[57:46] mules burdens of earth for thy servant
[57:49] will henceforth offer neither burnt off
[57:51] offering nor sacrifice unto
[57:55] other gods but unto the lord
[57:57] and in this saying the lord pardon thy
[57:59] servant that when my master goeth into
[58:02] the house of
[58:03] women
[58:04] to worship there
[58:06] and he leaneth on my hand and i bow
[58:08] myself in the house of remnan when i bow
[58:10] myself down in the house of remnan the
[58:12] lord pardoned thy servant in this thing
[58:15] so he's saying my master still a heathen
[58:17] he's going to go and do these things i'm
[58:18] his right hand man but that's not where
[58:21] my heart is at so the lord pardoned me
[58:23] when i carry those functions out
[58:25] and elisha speaks to me says
[58:27] and they said unto him go in peace
[58:30] so he departed from him a little way
[58:33] but gegaza
[58:35] the servant of elisha the man of god
[58:37] said behold my master hath spared naaman
[58:40] this syrian and not receiving at his
[58:42] hands that which he hath brought but as
[58:45] the lord liveth i will run after him and
[58:47] take somewhat of him
[58:49] so gaza followed after naaman and when
[58:51] naaman saw him running after him he
[58:53] lighted down from the chariot to meet
[58:55] him and said is all well and he said all
[58:58] is well
[59:00] my master hath sent me saying behold
[59:03] even
[59:04] even now there be come to me from mount
[59:07] ephraim two young men of the sons of the
[59:10] prophets give them i pray thee a talent
[59:13] of silver and two changes of garments
[59:17] and naaman said unto him be content take
[59:20] two talents and he urged him and bound
[59:22] two talents of silver and two bags with
[59:24] two changes of garments and laid them
[59:27] upon his two servants and they bear them
[59:28] before him
[59:32] and when he came to the tower he took
[59:34] them from their hand
[59:35] and bestowed them in the house and he
[59:37] let the men go and they departed
[59:40] but he went in and stood before his
[59:42] master
[59:43] and elisha said unto him
[59:46] whence cometh thou gehesa
[59:49] and he said
[59:51] thy servant
[59:52] went no wither
[59:55] and he said unto him went not my heart
[59:58] with thee when the man turned again from
[1:00:00] his chariot to meet thee
[1:00:02] is it a time to receive money and to
[1:00:04] receive garments and olive yards and
[1:00:06] vineyards and sheep and oxygen oxen and
[1:00:09] men servants and maidservants
[1:00:11] the leprosy therefore of naaman shall
[1:00:14] cleave unto thee
[1:00:15] and unto thy seed forever and he went
[1:00:18] out from his presence a leper as white
[1:00:21] of snow
[1:00:24] i would bear to say
[1:00:26] that naaman wasn't considering the
[1:00:29] effects this would have on his children
[1:00:31] when he did this
[1:00:34] for a little money
[1:00:36] and two changes of garments
[1:00:39] he didn't
[1:00:40] consider the effects this would have
[1:00:44] not only on him
[1:00:46] but on his children forever
[1:00:50] this
[1:00:51] is mind-boggling to me
[1:00:54] how a man can walk with the living word
[1:00:57] for his age
[1:00:59] and see the discernment day in and day
[1:01:02] out and know that this man speaks with
[1:01:06] god and god speaks with him on a daily
[1:01:09] basis and he would get so exalted and
[1:01:13] lifted up in his position this is a
[1:01:15] lucifer spirit it's so clear
[1:01:17] he gets so lifted up in his position of
[1:01:20] walking with the man of god
[1:01:23] that now he would go and he would do
[1:01:25] something
[1:01:27] and that's wrong within itself
[1:01:29] but he would have the brazenness to come
[1:01:32] back and stand before the man of god
[1:01:35] like he doesn't doesn't know what
[1:01:37] happened
[1:01:38] and look at him and lie to him
[1:01:43] where have thou where's that went okay
[1:01:46] i didn't go anywhere
[1:01:49] i don't know what you're talking about
[1:01:53] he's lost his mind saints
[1:01:56] he has literally become so possessed of
[1:02:00] an evil spirit in his own position that
[1:02:03] he has lost his mind
[1:02:06] like elisha doesn't know
[1:02:11] or if he doesn't know
[1:02:13] like god's not going to reveal it to him
[1:02:17] he's literally lost his mind
[1:02:22] i can't wrap my mind around this
[1:02:26] i can't understand this
[1:02:28] but this is the frailty of human beings
[1:02:32] this is the frailty of ananias and
[1:02:34] sapphire
[1:02:35] to set in that early church and see the
[1:02:38] miraculous
[1:02:40] and then think you're going to pull one
[1:02:41] over on god
[1:02:45] what happened in both of these
[1:02:46] situations is they failed to recognize
[1:02:49] that god wants to indwell his people
[1:02:55] that's what god was trying to do in the
[1:02:57] early church
[1:02:59] and they failed to recognize the desire
[1:03:01] of god to express himself to his people
[1:03:04] that's what gehesa missed is this was
[1:03:07] not just a prophet this was not just a
[1:03:09] man of god this was god's desire
[1:03:12] remember he had he only had three parts
[1:03:14] in the back of his mind a three-part
[1:03:16] plan in the back of his mind
[1:03:19] that was to express himself
[1:03:21] he doesn't realize that as he's doing
[1:03:24] this
[1:03:25] this little bit of money and this little
[1:03:27] change of garment that he's going
[1:03:29] against
[1:03:30] the very sole purpose of god
[1:03:33] wanting to indwell his people
[1:03:36] wanting to expose
[1:03:38] a pure heart or an impure heart
[1:03:42] second kings
[1:03:48] now let me let me go here
[1:03:51] i'll just make it real simple
[1:03:54] and say what brother branham said 1958
[1:03:56] looking at the unseen and when the great
[1:03:59] when the great crisis come
[1:04:01] which always does
[1:04:04] then when geheza
[1:04:06] being just a lukewarm church member
[1:04:11] there you have it he's identified the
[1:04:13] character of de gaza
[1:04:17] so when a great crisis comes a lukewarm
[1:04:20] church member
[1:04:21] is going to go against what the prophet
[1:04:25] has taught
[1:04:26] in such simple things
[1:04:28] and think that they're okay with it
[1:04:30] that's the characteristics that's the
[1:04:32] spirit that was on gehesa
[1:04:34] then when geheza being just a lukewarm
[1:04:37] church member
[1:04:38] he had not seen what elijah had seen
[1:04:41] because elijah was used to walking by
[1:04:44] faith and he was looking at the unseen
[1:04:45] all the time
[1:04:47] and he knew that god had said in the
[1:04:49] psalms the angels of god are encamped
[1:04:51] about those that fear him
[1:04:52] that was enough for elijah just the word
[1:04:55] was enough for elisha
[1:04:57] but geheza
[1:05:00] had just halfway believed it
[1:05:04] he was just a church member
[1:05:09] if you're just a church member
[1:05:13] and your confession
[1:05:15] is you're just a church member
[1:05:18] so be it
[1:05:20] but that wasn't gahey's confession
[1:05:23] gehey's confession was i walk with the
[1:05:26] living word on a daily basis
[1:05:30] that's why this was a problem
[1:05:33] because if you have a confession i walk
[1:05:35] with the living word on a daily basis
[1:05:39] you're not going to go try to sneak
[1:05:41] something behind the living word to
[1:05:43] accomplish your self desires
[1:05:45] that was the problem
[1:05:47] so if gaza would have just came back and
[1:05:49] told him
[1:05:50] elisha
[1:05:53] i wanted to buy some donkeys
[1:05:55] and i needed two talents of silver so i
[1:05:58] went and got it from him i don't know
[1:05:59] what the outcome would have been
[1:06:01] but at least he's honest at least he
[1:06:02] doesn't have leprosy
[1:06:05] if he would have just told him
[1:06:08] my clothes were getting too tight
[1:06:10] i needed some new garments
[1:06:12] and i really liked that color that he
[1:06:13] had
[1:06:15] pureness of heart see if there is
[1:06:19] something laying in your heart that's
[1:06:20] impure so long as you're honest about it
[1:06:23] there's the capability of god to come
[1:06:25] and remove it
[1:06:27] but if you're not honest about it he has
[1:06:29] no capability to remove it
[1:06:33] and spiritual death follows
[1:06:35] every time
[1:06:38] second kings 8 verse 1 says then spake
[1:06:41] elisha unto the woman whose son he had
[1:06:43] restored to life saying arise and go
[1:06:46] thou and thine household and sojourn
[1:06:48] wheresoever thou thou can't sojourn for
[1:06:50] the lord hath called for a famine and he
[1:06:53] shall also come upon the land seven
[1:06:54] years so elisha goes back to the
[1:06:56] shunamite woman after her son is raised
[1:06:58] and he says there's a famine coming on
[1:07:00] the land go anywhere you can to preserve
[1:07:02] yourself it's okay
[1:07:03] just just go wherever you can wherever
[1:07:05] the lord leads you bad times are coming
[1:07:08] and the woman arose and did after after
[1:07:10] the saying of the man of god and she
[1:07:12] went with her household and sojourned in
[1:07:14] the land of the philistines seven years
[1:07:16] and it came to pass at the end of the
[1:07:17] seven years in that the woman returned
[1:07:20] out of the lands of the philistines and
[1:07:21] she went forth to crime to the king for
[1:07:23] her house and for her land i'm not going
[1:07:25] to go into all the types there we know
[1:07:27] that's the church ages we know that this
[1:07:28] is a restoration afterwards we know
[1:07:30] she's crying unto the king just like we
[1:07:32] have the capability to do now but
[1:07:35] it says here something very interesting
[1:07:38] and the king talked with geheza
[1:07:42] the servant of the man of god saying
[1:07:45] tell me i pray thee all the great things
[1:07:48] that elisha hath done
[1:07:51] elisha is smitten with leprosy but he
[1:07:55] finds himself at the disposal of the
[1:07:57] king and the king is requesting him tell
[1:08:00] me what you've seen tell me the great
[1:08:03] things that god did through elijah tell
[1:08:05] me of these things i want to hear about
[1:08:06] them
[1:08:09] and gehazis starts talking it says and
[1:08:12] it came to pass as he was telling the
[1:08:14] king how he had restored a dead body to
[1:08:16] life that behold the woman whose son he
[1:08:19] had restored to life cried to the king
[1:08:21] for her house and for her land and
[1:08:23] geheza said my lord o king this is the
[1:08:25] woman and this is her son whom elijah
[1:08:28] restored to life and when the king asked
[1:08:30] the woman she told him so the king
[1:08:32] appointed to her a certain officer
[1:08:34] saying restore all that was hers
[1:08:38] and all of the fruits of the field since
[1:08:40] the day the day that she left the land
[1:08:42] even until now
[1:08:45] so gegaza come and he lies to the living
[1:08:47] word he lies to elisha he covers
[1:08:49] something up he's smitten with leprosy
[1:08:51] he's cast out from the presence of the
[1:08:53] living word and now he finds himself in
[1:08:56] a position that the only thing that he
[1:08:58] can do is testify about what happened in
[1:09:00] a previous generation
[1:09:02] the only thing that he can testify about
[1:09:04] is what god did in somebody else's life
[1:09:08] he has no capability the king did not
[1:09:10] come and ask him what did get what did
[1:09:12] elisha do in your life what did god do
[1:09:15] through you the king's question to him
[1:09:17] is what did god do through elisha
[1:09:20] and geheza had no ability to interject
[1:09:23] oh by the way this is what he did for me
[1:09:28] because he had an impure heart
[1:09:31] in so much that as he even tries to tell
[1:09:34] the king and witness and testify what
[1:09:37] god did in somebody else's life the
[1:09:39] person that that that god moved through
[1:09:42] comes on the scene and says be quiet
[1:09:46] i can testify myself
[1:09:48] i can tell the king myself what god has
[1:09:52] done in my life
[1:09:53] geheza put himself in such a position
[1:09:56] that he couldn't even testify what god
[1:09:58] had did in a prior age see this is the
[1:10:01] effects of spiritual death you end up on
[1:10:03] a pale horse
[1:10:05] you have no life in you whatsoever
[1:10:08] geheza can't even testify about what
[1:10:10] he's seen
[1:10:12] because god won't permit it
[1:10:14] in the court of law another person
[1:10:16] cannot testify about what another person
[1:10:18] has seen it's considered hearsay it's
[1:10:20] thrown out every time
[1:10:23] only the person with the testimony can
[1:10:25] testify
[1:10:29] jesus starts trying to steal this
[1:10:31] woman's testimony
[1:10:33] and god won't even
[1:10:35] permit it in his scriptures
[1:10:37] he sends that woman in
[1:10:39] you tell me what a coincidence that is
[1:10:42] the king asks tell me what happened
[1:10:44] and he starts telling him what happened
[1:10:46] about this certain lady and that certain
[1:10:48] lady just happens to show up at the same
[1:10:49] place at the same time
[1:10:52] i'm willing to guess there's
[1:10:54] several zeros on the end of those odds
[1:10:57] this was ordained of god to hold his
[1:10:59] scriptures true
[1:11:01] no geheseh
[1:11:03] you will not testify about what i have
[1:11:05] done in my bride's life she will testify
[1:11:07] what i have done in her life she is the
[1:11:10] one with a pure heart she is the one to
[1:11:12] stand in the presence of the king
[1:11:16] we don't want to come to that point
[1:11:21] we want to approach god with a pure
[1:11:22] heart
[1:11:23] and we want to be thankful for that
[1:11:25] opportunity
[1:11:28] we're coming to a close i want to touch
[1:11:30] on one more person and then we're going
[1:11:31] to wrap this up
[1:11:34] exodus 15 verse 20 you don't have to
[1:11:36] turn there it says in miriam the
[1:11:38] prophetess the sister of aaron took a
[1:11:40] timbrel in her hand and all the women
[1:11:42] went out after her with timbrels and
[1:11:44] with dances this is just right after
[1:11:45] they passed through the red sea and
[1:11:47] miriam answered them sing ye to the lord
[1:11:49] for he hath triumphed gloriously the
[1:11:52] horse and his rider hath he thrown into
[1:11:54] the sea
[1:11:55] so we know miriam is the sister of moses
[1:11:58] they come through the red sea this is
[1:12:00] referred to many times how she takes the
[1:12:02] tambourine runs up and down the shores
[1:12:04] singing the praises of god she is really
[1:12:06] in the spirit but there's something to
[1:12:09] be exposed in miriam
[1:12:11] numbers 12
[1:12:13] and miriam and aaron spoke against moses
[1:12:17] because of the ethiopian woman whom he
[1:12:20] had married for he had married an
[1:12:22] ethiopian woman
[1:12:25] and they said hath the lord indeed
[1:12:27] spoken only by moses
[1:12:29] hath he not spoken also by us
[1:12:32] and the lord heard it
[1:12:34] you'll notice there's a pattern here
[1:12:37] it's the same pattern that lucifer took
[1:12:39] self-fog
[1:12:40] self-exaltation
[1:12:46] i would like to ask her why she wasn't
[1:12:48] asking this question
[1:12:50] when moses was calling for the plagues
[1:12:52] down in egypt
[1:12:55] why didn't you ask this question then
[1:12:57] he was married to an ethiopian woman
[1:12:59] then
[1:13:00] why aren't you making fun of him then
[1:13:03] why aren't you making fun of him when
[1:13:04] you're standing there before the red sea
[1:13:06] and you see him speaking part the waters
[1:13:10] why don't you have something to say then
[1:13:12] but now when they come through that and
[1:13:14] if you want to say the spirit fades away
[1:13:16] a little bit there's not so much
[1:13:18] miraculous happening it's a wilderness
[1:13:20] journey it's the nitty-gritty it's the
[1:13:22] daily walk
[1:13:26] and now they got something to say about
[1:13:27] moses
[1:13:29] now he's not such a self you know not
[1:13:33] such a glorious figure
[1:13:37] now the man moses was very meek above
[1:13:40] all the men which were upon the face of
[1:13:42] the earth
[1:13:43] and the lord spake suddenly unto moses
[1:13:45] and to aaron and unto miriam
[1:13:48] come out ye three under the tabernacle
[1:13:50] of the congregation
[1:13:52] and they three came out it looks like
[1:13:55] god's vindicated what aaron and aaron
[1:13:57] and miriam said
[1:13:59] now it's god himself saying
[1:14:02] moses and aaron and miriam come out
[1:14:08] the story don't end there though
[1:14:10] and the lord came down in the pillar of
[1:14:12] the cloud and stood in the door of the
[1:14:14] tabernacle and called aaron aaron and
[1:14:17] miriam and they both come forth
[1:14:21] oh my i mean look at the vindication of
[1:14:23] her doctrine now
[1:14:25] god does not just speak with moses he
[1:14:27] speaks with aaron and me as well
[1:14:29] in so much that he calls us when he
[1:14:31] calls moses
[1:14:33] in so much that he actually has now just
[1:14:35] called for me and aaron
[1:14:40] sounds like lucifer to me
[1:14:45] and he said
[1:14:47] the lord speaking
[1:14:49] hear now
[1:14:50] my words
[1:14:52] he's about to speak to them personally
[1:14:56] that's pretty good then to take
[1:14:57] vindication
[1:15:01] if there be a prophet among you i the
[1:15:03] lord will make myself known in him
[1:15:05] in a vision and i will speak to him in a
[1:15:08] dream
[1:15:09] my service servant moses is not so
[1:15:14] who is faithful
[1:15:16] in all mine house
[1:15:19] with him will i speak mouth-to-mouth
[1:15:22] even apparently and not in dark speeches
[1:15:25] and the similitude of the lord shall he
[1:15:28] behold
[1:15:29] wherefore then were ye not afraid to
[1:15:33] speak against my servant moses
[1:15:36] this is god's polite way of saying what
[1:15:39] were you thinking
[1:15:41] do you have any clue who this is to me
[1:15:46] what are you doing
[1:15:48] and the anger of the lord was kindled
[1:15:51] against them
[1:15:52] and he departed
[1:15:54] and the cloud departed from off the
[1:15:55] tabernacle and behold miriam became
[1:15:58] leprous
[1:15:59] white as snow
[1:16:00] and aaron looked upon miriam and behold
[1:16:03] she was leprous
[1:16:06] and aaron said unto moses at last my
[1:16:08] lord oh at last my lord alas my lord
[1:16:15] it's not what he was saying a couple
[1:16:16] verses earlier
[1:16:18] i beseech thee
[1:16:20] laying off the sin upon us where we
[1:16:22] where in we have done foolishly
[1:16:26] and wherein we have sinned
[1:16:29] this is the smartest thing that aaron
[1:16:30] has done in a long time
[1:16:33] this has been exposed and he immediately
[1:16:36] repents
[1:16:38] the only chance that he had
[1:16:41] let her not be as undead and of whom the
[1:16:43] flesh is half consumed when he when he
[1:16:46] cometh out of the mother's womb now look
[1:16:48] at the character of moses
[1:16:51] and moses cried unto the lord saying
[1:16:55] give her what she deserves
[1:16:58] no
[1:17:02] says heal her now lord
[1:17:05] heal her now oh god i beseech thee
[1:17:08] moses moses took no pride in this
[1:17:12] situation he took no joy in this
[1:17:14] situation
[1:17:18] and the lord said unto moses if her
[1:17:20] father had been spit in her face should
[1:17:22] she not be ashamed seven days let her be
[1:17:24] shut out from the camp even seven days
[1:17:26] and after that let her be received again
[1:17:30] and miriam was shed out from the camp
[1:17:32] seven days and the people journeyed not
[1:17:35] until miriam was brought in again
[1:17:39] this is another example of the days of
[1:17:41] ananias and sapphira even before the
[1:17:42] days of ananias since the fire arrived
[1:17:46] there was an exposure of the heart
[1:17:49] but thank god there was an opportunity
[1:17:51] for repentance and that opportunity was
[1:17:54] seized upon and life was preserved
[1:17:57] and this is the way the true church of
[1:17:59] god should operate because not only was
[1:18:02] life preserved but that church said
[1:18:04] we're not moving until they can come
[1:18:07] with us until miriam can get cleansed
[1:18:10] and come with us
[1:18:11] there was no desire
[1:18:14] for the congregation to move on and
[1:18:16] leave somebody behind
[1:18:18] it was not even in the desire of god
[1:18:20] because remember the congregation moved
[1:18:21] when the pillar of fire moved and when
[1:18:23] the cloud moved
[1:18:25] so if god would have had a desire to
[1:18:27] leave her behind he would have moved
[1:18:28] but the pillar of fire didn't move and
[1:18:30] the cloud didn't move
[1:18:32] because the character of god was not for
[1:18:35] death the character of god was to expose
[1:18:38] sin so that there can be repentance and
[1:18:41] there can be life come forth in the
[1:18:43] whole body
[1:18:49] but remember brother branham says if you
[1:18:50] take that name of the lord jesus christ
[1:18:52] and then you go and you live a life
[1:18:54] unworthy of that you'll have to pay for
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:58] numbers 20 verse 1 then came the
[1:19:00] children of israel even the whole
[1:19:02] congregation
[1:19:03] into the desert of zen
[1:19:05] in the first month and the people abode
[1:19:07] in kadush and miriam died there
[1:19:10] and was buried there
[1:19:12] 1965 the easter seal brother branham
[1:19:14] said this concerning that moses had that
[1:19:16] quickening power there never was a man
[1:19:18] like him on the earth until jesus for he
[1:19:20] didn't only see visions he talked face
[1:19:22] to face with god even a prophetess
[1:19:25] miriam disputed his word one day he said
[1:19:28] don't you fear god consider my servant
[1:19:31] moses there's nobody in the world like
[1:19:33] him this hour there's never been anybody
[1:19:36] like moses i speak to moses what did he
[1:19:39] ever say that wasn't true
[1:19:41] don't you say a word against him and
[1:19:43] right then she was stricken with leprosy
[1:19:46] and was dying
[1:19:49] she didn't live very long afterwards
[1:19:52] moses prayed for her
[1:19:54] so even though
[1:19:56] there was repentance
[1:19:58] even though there was intercession
[1:20:01] even though she was healed of the
[1:20:03] leprosy
[1:20:04] that flagrant violation
[1:20:07] against god in flesh
[1:20:11] the word made flesh that flagrant
[1:20:15] uh that flagrant statement that she made
[1:20:18] carried a consequence
[1:20:20] and brother brennan says she died very
[1:20:22] shortly after that thank god there was
[1:20:25] repentance
[1:20:26] thank god she was made whole thank god
[1:20:28] the church didn't move on without her
[1:20:29] thank god she was with the church when
[1:20:31] it moved
[1:20:32] but there's still a penalty to pay
[1:20:35] for an impure heart
[1:20:40] god speaking in deuteronomy 20 40 says
[1:20:42] take heed in the plague of leprosy
[1:20:46] thou observed diligent diligently and do
[1:20:48] according to all that the priests and
[1:20:51] levites shall teach you as i commanded
[1:20:54] them so ye shall observe to do it
[1:20:56] remember
[1:20:58] what the lord thy god did unto miriam by
[1:21:01] the way
[1:21:04] after that he were come forth out of
[1:21:06] egypt
[1:21:07] so this is such a serious event that
[1:21:09] even god himself picks it up
[1:21:11] when he's telling the people to mind
[1:21:13] what the levites are telling you do what
[1:21:16] they say especially when it comes to the
[1:21:17] to the plague of leprosy
[1:21:20] mind your peace mind your cues
[1:21:22] remember mary
[1:21:25] he wasn't joking about it
[1:21:26] brother branham says miriam
[1:21:29] i won't read you all the quotes but he
[1:21:31] said miriam disrespected
[1:21:35] spoke against
[1:21:38] and should have known better
[1:21:41] that was her problems
[1:21:43] she disrespected the word of god
[1:21:45] the man of god
[1:21:48] she spoke against the man of god and he
[1:21:51] said she should have known better
[1:21:56] in the church age book rev
[1:21:58] brother brandon says he reads the
[1:22:00] scripture
[1:22:01] revelation chapter 2 verse 5 as the
[1:22:03] musicians would come please
[1:22:06] revelation revelation chapter 2 verse 5
[1:22:08] speaking of the ephesian church age
[1:22:10] says remember therefore
[1:22:13] from whence thou art fallen
[1:22:17] and repent
[1:22:22] through the first works
[1:22:24] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[1:22:26] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[1:22:27] his his place
[1:22:29] except thou repent
[1:22:32] brother brandon says god tells them to
[1:22:34] remember
[1:22:36] evidently something had left their minds
[1:22:40] they had forgotten something he told
[1:22:42] them to turn back in their minds to
[1:22:43] their point of origin
[1:22:45] the origin of the first stage was
[1:22:47] pentecost
[1:22:52] this is me speaking now but remember
[1:22:54] what pentecost was pentecost wasn't just
[1:22:56] a day
[1:22:58] pentecost certainly not a denomination
[1:23:00] pentecost was a group of
[1:23:03] 120 people with pureness of heart
[1:23:07] that's what pentecost was pentecost
[1:23:09] would have never happened if 120 people
[1:23:11] didn't have pureness of heart that's why
[1:23:13] the scripture says they were all in one
[1:23:14] accord
[1:23:17] that's what brother branham says was the
[1:23:19] beginning
[1:23:20] the point of origin
[1:23:23] pureness of heart
[1:23:26] him speaking now
[1:23:28] they had fallen from it they had
[1:23:30] forgotten the glory and wonder of it it
[1:23:33] was time to go back in mind and then in
[1:23:36] reality
[1:23:38] back to when they could say for me to
[1:23:40] live is christ
[1:23:42] back to purity when ananias and sapphira
[1:23:45] were dealt with
[1:23:50] sin laying in the church has to be dealt
[1:23:52] with
[1:23:54] and when i say church don't think these
[1:23:56] walls here the body
[1:23:59] sin laying in the body has to be dealt
[1:24:02] with or it's impure and it is not the
[1:24:04] will of god there's no point to have a
[1:24:06] body of christ if there's sin in it
[1:24:08] because it's not pure
[1:24:09] it does
[1:24:10] there's not even any point in having
[1:24:12] church if we're going to have sin in the
[1:24:13] body
[1:24:14] i mean is that too far-fetched
[1:24:17] he says we need to get back to that in
[1:24:20] mind
[1:24:21] and then in reality
[1:24:23] i would just give you some free advice
[1:24:25] here don't worry about the sin and your
[1:24:27] brother and sister worried about your
[1:24:28] own
[1:24:30] and then if god needs to pick you up and
[1:24:31] reveal something to your brother and
[1:24:33] sister he'll do that and we'll accept
[1:24:35] that we're happy for that
[1:24:37] but let's make sure we're focused on the
[1:24:38] right thing back to purity of mind my
[1:24:41] own mind
[1:24:43] and then
[1:24:44] living that out in reality
[1:24:47] he says back to the gate beautiful all
[1:24:49] what a report reproach it is to drift
[1:24:51] from god
[1:24:53] and countenance those acts that defile
[1:24:55] his name let those who name his name
[1:24:58] depart from sin and keep their vessels
[1:25:00] pure for god
[1:25:01] look at what you once were in your heart
[1:25:03] and mind and in your life then go back
[1:25:06] to it
[1:25:07] this is still good advice
[1:25:10] remember what you were when you first
[1:25:12] came to christ and received the baptism
[1:25:14] of the holy spirit the only way you
[1:25:17] received that is with pureness of heart
[1:25:20] you wouldn't have received it if you had
[1:25:22] something still laying in your heart
[1:25:24] it can't happen the only way for that to
[1:25:27] happen is when you completely forsake
[1:25:30] your will and accept his will when you
[1:25:32] completely forsake your spirit and say
[1:25:35] will will his spirit come in
[1:25:37] and brother branham is saying don't lose
[1:25:39] that hold on to that that's your point
[1:25:42] of origin that's the pureness of heart
[1:25:43] is when you've come to that point to be
[1:25:45] broken completely and says not what not
[1:25:47] my will but your will
[1:25:51] he says
[1:25:52] look at what you once were in your heart
[1:25:54] and in your mind and in your life that
[1:25:56] pureness of heart
[1:25:58] then go back to it
[1:26:01] he says and what is the way back
[1:26:05] the way is the way of repentance
[1:26:08] if a sinner has to come to god by the
[1:26:11] way of repentance then the lukewarm or
[1:26:13] backslider will have to repent that much
[1:26:16] more why
[1:26:18] because you knew better
[1:26:21] just like miriam
[1:26:25] prove it by your life
[1:26:28] if you do not repent said god i will
[1:26:32] remove your lampstand
[1:26:34] certainly a church in that condition
[1:26:37] cannot give light to the world
[1:26:42] don't make it plural make it singular a
[1:26:44] person in that condition cannot give
[1:26:46] light to the world
[1:26:48] a person in that condition cannot truly
[1:26:51] represent the message of the hour
[1:26:53] christ in me the hope of glory
[1:26:56] that only comes with pureness of heart
[1:27:00] its light has turned to darkness
[1:27:04] god will then take away its faithful
[1:27:06] messenger
[1:27:07] and its faithful shepherds and leave
[1:27:10] them to themselves and they will go on
[1:27:12] talking about christianity but be beref
[1:27:16] of it
[1:27:19] if you make excuses for anything laying
[1:27:21] in your heart that's not like the
[1:27:23] character of christ that's the result
[1:27:26] god will remove the candlestick
[1:27:30] and i will say it this way
[1:27:32] the candlestick may still physically
[1:27:35] stand there
[1:27:36] but you will be dull to the effects of
[1:27:39] it
[1:27:40] the candlestick may still stand there
[1:27:43] and say the exact same things that it's
[1:27:45] been saying
[1:27:47] but your ears will be close to it and
[1:27:48] it's been removed from you now
[1:27:53] if you'll just play something softly
[1:27:54] please
[1:27:56] we're going to close
[1:27:57] but i told you this was not a
[1:27:59] condemnation message
[1:28:01] you've been a little bit quiet it's not
[1:28:03] hellfire and brimstone you can relax
[1:28:06] there is an opportunity for repentance
[1:28:08] so we'll end on a positive note look at
[1:28:10] david
[1:28:13] look at everything that david did evenly
[1:28:15] that he knew better to do
[1:28:19] to the point that nathan i believe it
[1:28:21] was nathan the prophet would come to him
[1:28:22] and he'd say david a man has done
[1:28:25] a b and c
[1:28:26] and david said kill him
[1:28:29] any man that would do something like
[1:28:30] that is worthy of death
[1:28:34] and nathan would enter saying he says
[1:28:35] surely thou will not die but you're that
[1:28:38] man
[1:28:39] and david immediately repents
[1:28:43] the scripture declares david a man after
[1:28:46] god's own heart
[1:28:49] but look at everything that he did that
[1:28:51] was wrong
[1:28:52] so that certainly can't be
[1:28:55] a man after god's own heart in that
[1:28:57] condition that that certainly can't be
[1:28:59] what god is referring to
[1:29:01] what god is referring to is that every
[1:29:04] time
[1:29:05] every time david fell
[1:29:07] every time he did something wrong and
[1:29:09] the truth was presented to him he
[1:29:11] repented
[1:29:12] every time
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:18] the days of ananias and sapphira
[1:29:21] were well be back before the days of
[1:29:24] ananias and sapphire
[1:29:28] the days of ananias and sapphira were
[1:29:30] all the way back in genesis
[1:29:33] 3.
[1:29:37] man had fallen
[1:29:39] sewed together fig leaves
[1:29:43] god comes and says
[1:29:46] where are you
[1:29:48] kind of like elisha saying to jesus
[1:29:50] where have you been like he doesn't know
[1:29:54] god himself comes if you'll stand with
[1:29:56] me
[1:29:57] god himself comes and says adam adam
[1:30:00] where art thou
[1:30:02] adam
[1:30:04] clothed in fig leaves we've heard this
[1:30:06] before but just think of it clothed in
[1:30:08] fig leaves
[1:30:10] in the presence of that voice declares i
[1:30:12] am naked
[1:30:14] here is the days of ananias and sapphira
[1:30:17] thousands of years before the days of
[1:30:18] ananias and sapphira arrived
[1:30:21] a full exposure
[1:30:24] of the heart by the word of god
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:31] but adam can
[1:30:32] repent god intercedes and makes a way
[1:30:36] because it wasn't adam's heart desire to
[1:30:39] be in that position
[1:30:42] and he had enough sense about him as a
[1:30:45] son of god that when god came and says
[1:30:47] where art thou he didn't try to say
[1:30:50] here i am
[1:30:52] i'm fully clothed nothing's wrong
[1:30:55] we're fine
[1:30:56] you can go back to where you came from
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:30:59] but adam had enough pureness of heart
[1:31:03] that when the voice of god the word of
[1:31:05] god came by his way
[1:31:07] he says here i am
[1:31:09] and i'm naked
[1:31:11] help me
[1:31:14] this is where it started at and this is
[1:31:16] where it ends at because we just read
[1:31:17] revelation 2.
[1:31:19] when that bride tree starts out
[1:31:22] brother brandon says don't ever forget
[1:31:25] where your origin is
[1:31:28] because if you forget where your origin
[1:31:30] is you're going to end up in death
[1:31:31] and he says remember
[1:31:33] remember remember where you started out
[1:31:36] at and where did we all start out at
[1:31:39] saints i begged that question to you
[1:31:40] where did we all start out at
[1:31:43] full repentance to god
[1:31:45] full death to self
[1:31:49] the days of ananias and sapphira were
[1:31:51] back there
[1:31:52] they were at the early church and the
[1:31:54] opportunity is here today
[1:31:56] but we stand in such a rare position
[1:31:59] because now with the fullness of the
[1:32:02] word coming
[1:32:03] the fullness of the heart can be exposed
[1:32:06] and the scripture says who can know the
[1:32:08] heart of men it is deceitful it is
[1:32:11] wicked
[1:32:15] but because we've had a full word come
[1:32:17] to expose the full heart it doesn't have
[1:32:19] to be that way
[1:32:21] so let's allow those days to be
[1:32:24] current events let's not wait for
[1:32:27] something to happen let's let it happen
[1:32:30] let the word expose us
[1:32:33] but before you go into spiritual death
[1:32:35] just repent
[1:32:37] just repent
[1:32:39] and this is not a
[1:32:41] evangelistic workup of you know pack the
[1:32:44] altar repent i'm not into that if you
[1:32:46] want to come to the altar you're more
[1:32:47] welcome to i'm not against that
[1:32:50] what i'm for
[1:32:52] is pureness of heart both here and both
[1:32:54] there let's pray together
[1:32:57] lord jesus we just want to thank you for
[1:32:59] this opportunity that you've given us
[1:33:00] lord
[1:33:02] father and i pray that you would just
[1:33:03] take the words that have been spoken and
[1:33:05] that you would place
[1:33:06] them as only you can lord
[1:33:10] you know where each and every one needs
[1:33:11] to go and i pray that you would just
[1:33:13] appropriately place them father i pray
[1:33:15] that you would just let the people see
[1:33:17] what i was driving out here lord i just
[1:33:20] pray that this would not be a what we
[1:33:22] would term a depressing type of message
[1:33:23] or a condemnation type of message lord
[1:33:26] that's not my desire that's not my
[1:33:28] intent
[1:33:29] my desire is thanksgiving lord that we
[1:33:32] can stand here as such a privileged
[1:33:34] people
[1:33:35] to walk
[1:33:37] upright before a living god with
[1:33:39] pureness of heart
[1:33:40] not trying to self-preserve ourselves
[1:33:43] lord not trying to hide something from
[1:33:45] you but that we have a full word laid
[1:33:48] before us before us in this age that we
[1:33:50] can lay ourselves before it and let it
[1:33:53] completely expose us that we do not have
[1:33:56] to be like ananias and sapphire and the
[1:33:58] only results would be death lord that we
[1:34:01] can come and lay ourselves down before
[1:34:03] you and die to ourself lord that you may
[1:34:07] live
[1:34:08] father i pray that you would just be
[1:34:09] with us now
[1:34:11] lord that
[1:34:13] we would just each and everyone check
[1:34:16] ourselves as your prophet said may we
[1:34:19] remember
[1:34:21] may we remember that point that first
[1:34:24] point in our life
[1:34:26] as your prophet taught us what you did
[1:34:29] through the church ages you do to the
[1:34:31] individual
[1:34:32] and may we go back to that ephesian age
[1:34:36] in our life and remember
[1:34:38] that point of realization
[1:34:42] that i
[1:34:43] am lost without this word
[1:34:47] and i completely repent before it and i
[1:34:50] completely give myself over to it
[1:34:53] may we be thankful that we have that
[1:34:56] opportunity lord may we not take that
[1:34:58] lightly and may we do that each and
[1:35:00] every day lord we love you we just pray
[1:35:03] your blessings upon this people that you
[1:35:05] would be with them father we just pray
[1:35:07] our blessings upon our pastor and his
[1:35:09] family may you just go and touch them
[1:35:11] now lord give them their portion lord
[1:35:13] restore them here in their their
[1:35:16] position this weekend we pray
