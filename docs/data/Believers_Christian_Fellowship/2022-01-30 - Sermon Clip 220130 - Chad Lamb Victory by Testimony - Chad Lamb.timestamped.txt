[0:00] when paul says that the circumcision we
[0:02] have now is the circumcision of the
[0:04] heart not of the flesh
[0:06] where did moses say that
[0:11] but when paul wrote that letter amen the
[0:14] believers in that day they didn't say
[0:17] well let's take paul's letter that he
[0:20] wrote
[0:21] and then all the parts that we can find
[0:23] in the scripture will keep but the parts
[0:25] that we can't find in the scripture we
[0:26] won't keep
[0:31] paul's letter
[0:33] was the scriptures
[0:38] we
[0:39] read the bible and when we read the
[0:41] bible we're reading a letter that a
[0:43] church age messenger and a prophet of
[0:45] god wrote to a church in corinth wrote
[0:47] to a church in ephesus wrote to a church
[0:50] and he wrote it to the church and that
[0:52] day they had to receive it by faith
[0:55] having faith in who that man was
[0:57] [Applause]
[0:58] they didn't know that what they got was
[1:00] the scripture we look back and we say
[1:03] when paul says it that's thus saith the
[1:05] lord
[1:07] is that right
[1:08] when paul says amen if paul says this in
[1:12] the scripture it's thus saith the lord
[1:14] if paul says this is the way you do it
[1:15] in the church that's the way you do it
[1:17] in the church if paul says amen you
[1:19] don't stumble on brother you don't
[1:20] stumble a brother if paul says whatever
[1:22] paul says in those letters is the way we
[1:25] do it is thus saith the lord
[1:28] [Music]
[1:29] and we look back and say well obviously
[1:31] what else would they say it's the bible
[1:33] it wasn't the bible in their day
[1:35] [Applause]
[1:36] [Music]
[1:37] and paul was bringing things that put
[1:40] him absolutely contrary to the pharisees
[1:42] because he was saying things amen that
[1:44] you could not find direct correlation
[1:46] for in the scripture but paul was
[1:48] pulling out grace out of the law and he
[1:51] was establishing grace it was all the
[1:53] way through the bible but they couldn't
[1:56] see it but paul could see it by
[1:58] revelation and he would begin to take
[2:00] basing it on the entire bible he wrote
[2:02] this letter
[2:03] [Music]
[2:06] and they may not have been able to say
[2:08] what he said here oh that's
[2:11] deuteronomy xyz
[2:14] but when he wrote that letter that was
[2:17] thus saith the lord to that church
[2:20] and there were skeptics in paul's day
[2:24] there were skeptics who would say
[2:26] you know where does he get this no
[2:28] physical circumcision that's not
[2:30] anywhere in the bible
[2:33] there were a group of judaizers that
[2:35] were going around amen behind paul to
[2:38] the churches that paul established and
[2:39] they were they were bringing back law
[2:42] bringing back circumcision this is what
[2:44] the book of galatians is all about
[2:47] and they were skeptical of paul's
[2:49] writing because they believed paul had
[2:50] moved them away from the scriptures and
[2:52] they were trying to bring them back to
[2:54] the scriptures not knowing that paul was
[2:57] writing the scriptures
