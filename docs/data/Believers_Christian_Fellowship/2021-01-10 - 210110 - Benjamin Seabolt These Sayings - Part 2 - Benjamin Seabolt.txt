and i prayed lord make me more like thee and then he did and it wasn't a pleasant experience so we have to be careful about what we're asking and we have to mean what we're asking but i know that's each and every one of our hearts desires here this morning thank you musicians i appreciate that appreciate the atmosphere here this morning if you have your bibles we'll just go ahead and turn to the book of john chapter 10. we're going to begin reading it verse 24 john 10 24. i've been spending so much time in the book of john that william is now preaching to me at the house out of the book of john so he don't know any other book well i'll take that back he knows i think three other books but when he uh gets his little bible out let's turn to the book of john so i don't foresee myself going anywhere anytime shortly there is so much lane here when jesus comes and starts speaking these things let's begin reading here at john 10 24 and we'll read through 31 it says then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you and you believe not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because you're not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him let's just bow our heads together precious lord jesus we humbly thank you lord for this opportunity once again together together lord lord as we so often say not to gather around a man's idea or to socialize lord or just to come and to see each other father but we've been given an opportunity to come and together around you lord the revealed word for our age lord and we don't take that understanding lightly we appreciate that lord for we know that one day we will look back on these as just fond memories so i would pray that as we would still have this opportunity that we would take full advantage of it lord and that we would just yield ourselves to you both speaker and hear that you could come and that you could do what you have divinely orchestrated to do this morning we asked lord that you would come and do that which only you can do and that is to take this book and to loose the seals and to speak the word father we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you as you would have your seats i would just like to continue this morning i'm sure no surprise with these other things that brother branham has spoke about in the quote the seed is not heir with the shock he says luther had justification wesley had sanctification pentecostals had the restoration of the gifts but when the word come now they could produce that justification would save a man speaking of luther's day you believe that sure it was a carrier of the word just the same as i believe a stalk is part of the wheat sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't the life then along came sanctification how many believes in sanctification if you believe the bible you have to sure so still that's not it but then come the pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues there they called that the initial evidence which brought forth what the shock but they denominated but when you come to say i and the father are one i and my father are one and these other things then the shuck will pull away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever so this is obviously where i'm drawing my context or my inspiration from if you would say that because brother branham is making a comment here that when you come to say i and the father are one and these other things the shock will pull away from that and the way that he's making that comment is referencing and implying similarities of comments similar to i and my father are one so obviously me being the curious person that i am when he says these other things then then i have to know what these other things are and i believe by the grace of the of the lord that he's laying these things out to us and as i told you in the prior service these are not necessarily new things to us because these are things that have we've had the privilege of setting under a ministry that has been teaching these things so i just told brother chad in the back i think my role is that of peter as i've come along and just said this is that so it's not necessarily anything new but it's just to draw our attention and to maybe give us a little bit better clearer and concise and focused understanding of what exactly we have been hearing and how we should view that because brother branham says that when you say these other things the shock will pull away so if we've already been saying these other things what should be happening and what should we be seeing so i just want to bring if by the by the grace of the lord i just want to bring that into perspective that when that shuck starts pulling away don't let it surprise you because we've been saying these things we've been living these things we've been believing these things and the implications that come from that should not shock us it was the same that happened in genesis it was the same that happened when jesus was here it's going to be the same reaction when we begin to say those things so as we looked at the first part of that um back at the end of december we learned a few things we just as a way of a quick review for maybe some that weren't here i'm not going to spend a lot of time on this but just as a very quick review we learned that brother branham told us that the father's business was to destroy denominational thinking by explaining the scriptures with their true spiritual meaning and to fulfill the scriptures that's written of yourself that was the father's business we learn that the bride does have the power to remit sin of unbelief by presenting the living word for the day that we live in the same that jesus did the same that any believer down through the ages has had that power to remit sin by simply presenting the living word for that day so that power to remit sin did not cease in our age or it did not cease when jesus corporal body went off the sin or off the scene but the power to remit sin was even prior to that because there was believers that were that was presenting the living word for their day and as such was remembering sin to other individuals who would accept that so that truth and that power just doesn't go away with the corporal body leaving the scene we learned that brother branham taught us that all hell not just a small portion of it but all hell is against the revelation of christ to the individual all hell is not against the revelation of christ to the prophet all hell is not against the revelation of christ to your neighbor all hell is against the revelation of christ to you that's what we're concerned about we learned that the spirit of truth says jesus christ is come in the flesh which is why all hell is against the revelation of christ to the individual and we learned that the true bride doctrine is the spiritual bride is the word made flesh and blood again and brother branham says that anything opposes that is antichrist because anything that would oppose the true bright doctrine of jesus christ being made flesh again in the power of his word living and breathing in me and you is of the antichrist it opposes that jesus christ is come in the flesh and then i would say possibly the most important thing that we learned was that the antichrist frame the antichrist spirit within the framework of the church is not as far off as what we thought and that it's actually what we carry around with us each and every day in our hybrid spirit and our hybrid flesh combating and consistently conflicting with the seed the word that is trying to emit from our soul and we have to recognize that first and we can't put that anywhere else we have to recognize that that is the most important thing to recognize as she's saying that is the most important thing to recognize because in if you don't recognize that if i don't recognize that brother branham says that we will never be able to have the power to do the greater works because he says the power to do the greater works laid on that revelation to discern the antichrist spirit within the framework of the christian church if we're the christian church if we're the framework of the christian church we have to discern that within ourselves can we say amen so let's go to john 5. i know some of you are probably wondering how i just covered all of that in five minutes but yet it took me over two hours last time but brother brother chad was preaching at the beginning of the year that he wanted to be a farmer this year and that was his kind of vision that we should take on the spirit of a farmer and i thought that's good but you know some farmers are slower than others you know some plant with uh high-powered machinery and they go really fast and they have gps devices on their machines to tell them exactly how fast to go and what to do and then some are just out there with a hand plow so he didn't say which we should be so i'll let you decide which i was john 5 verse 5 as we would look to maybe see some of these other things that jesus said to cause the shuck to pull away and a certain man was there this is at the pool of bethesda we won't take time to read the first part of it this is at the pool of bethesda were very familiar with this and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and eight years when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been there a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole simple question right severe implications because jesus has come along and he says wilt thou be made whole that implies that he has the power to make him whole the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another step down before me jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk then they ask him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that was healed with not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away the multitude being in that place afterward jesus fined him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest the worst thing come upon thee the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day but jesus answered them not what they wanted to hear my father worketh hitherto and i work therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god this revelation that we're preaching is not a new revelation saints it's not a new understanding what has happened is this understanding has been obscured for thousands of years but even the religious sect in that day who was not walking in the light for their age recognize that this man came on the scene and said that i'm doing the works of my father my father is working and i'm working with him they recognize the fact that he said that god was his father what that made him they didn't even have to sit down and study this out or contemplate this it says immediately immediately they took issue with this so just because just because ages have went by and years have went by and this revelation and this understanding has been withdrawn and taken from even what we would call the nominal christian church or the nominal world that does not make it a radical idea now it's not a radical idea just because a layer is pulled off of something and exposed for what it was back two thousand years ago two thousand years ago you could say this and they didn't have a problem with it they understood that god that the the son that would come forth from god the messiah that would come forth from god would be god the problem they had is when he said he was that now two thousand years later they can't even accept the fact that the father and the son is the same thing let alone the fact that you are you or she and that she is he that's radical that's unacceptable kill that with some stones but i want to back up because i don't want to go too fast through this chapter because there were some really there were some things that stuck out here to me in verse 6 jesus comes and he asks a question he comes and he asks a question will thou be made whole and as i said before this implies that he has the power to do what he's asking and he's asking the question will that me be made whole meaning i have the power to make you whole if you want to be whole he did not ask him do you want me to help you do you want me to give you a book do you want me to get somebody else that will help you he says wilt thou be made whole the man answered sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another step down before me jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath the jews therefore said unto him that was cured watch the question that they asked him the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them he that made me hold the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk then they asked him what man is it that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk as we're reading this it's so easy just to read through this and not catch this but when i read this i ponder here is a man that has laid in the bed for 38 years and there's now a man who has came along with the power to say take up thy bed and walk and instead of asking who is the man that made you whole they said who is the man that told you to carry your bad on bed on the sabbath day i mean i've been accused of being legalistic but i mean this is a whole other level of all things this i mean do we understand the fact pattern here this man's laid here for 38 years he's been made whole and the only thing that they can think to ask him is who's told you to come and bust up our denominational thinking who has told you to come and throw a wrench into our tradition our traditional sunday service who has who has asked who has told you to do these things not wilt now who has told you and made you whole they won't ask you that they want to know who's disturbing things who is threatening our position who is going to put us out of a job if this be so i'm not concerned that you've been made whole what i'm concerned about is my self security and how many how many in here can relate to that when the message of the hour came your way [Music] the people that you thought well everybody will see this everybody will love this will will thou be made whole you're just chucking that out to everybody you come to will thou be made whole like i've been made whole well that'll be made whole like like i've been made home and they've known you they've known me and they've known that you've laid there and putin for 38 years maybe not 38 years you put your own number in there but of all things they just can't seem to ask how is it that you have been made whole they want to know why are you trying to cause this confliction in my life by presenting this cult to me by presenting this false doctrine to me what what is your problem where are these radical who has told you this who has told you to come and disturb my traditional sunday plans they don't say yes please make me whole they want to know who is causing this disturbance why are you doing this to me see if we can't discern the spirits within the framework of the christian church we will so easily be caught into that because the question they asked they had scripture for the question they asked was not a what we would say a wrong question it was a very scriptural question the problem was they missed the point this is a man who had been laying in false teaching for years this is a man that had been stuck in the denominational system for years you say that's not what the scripture says well just follow me just follow me i'm not talking about that man anymore this is somebody who is laid under false doctrine and denominational teaching and denominational understanding i'll even bring it closer they have laid under their own understanding for 38 years and now comes along a message that says wilt thou be made whole and our hybrid carnal spirit the only thing that it can think to do when this comes along is not say yes i want to be made whole the only thing it can do is say who's saying that who is telling you to break this tradition of your own thinking this is not acceptable i must kill this with stones of my own revelation of my own hybrid revelation i i cannot let you be whole no it would never obviously utter that that i i mean the scribes and the pharisees they obviously wouldn't come to that man and say well we do not want you to be made whole but what are they really saying who is this that's told you to carry your bed on the sabbath day you you cannot do that that's radical that clearly breaks the law wrong question to ask wrong motivation don't think that spirit's dead we pack it around with us each and every day what man is it that said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that was healed with not who it was for jesus has conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place how many can relate to this you have a revelation come strike in your heart and you start declaring that then people will question that revelation and your answer to them is i don't know i don't know where that's found in the message i don't know where it's found in the scriptures all i know is i'm whole same position this man was in i don't know where to find i don't know i can't tie it all together i can't explain to you how i see all these things you know what i don't know how i was back there and i fought a battle in heaven already and i resisted the devil's lie and kicked him out i don't know how i already won that battle but i know i did i don't know how i can tie that through all the scriptures how i can talk how to tie that all through the message but i know it's true but we've believed that for years and now the same thing that happened to this man because we have believed something happens to us watch what happens afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest the worst thing come upon thee the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus now jesus will drop this revelation into our heart and he'll expect us to accept that he'll expect us to walk in that even when he doesn't give us all the pieces to put together even when we can explain to somebody else he'll expect us to believe that but if and when you do he will always come back on the scene and reveal to you this was jesus this is jesus christ come in the flesh and this is where you can find it he will always do that same thing that he did with this man so don't be afraid just because you can't put all the puzzle pieces together and just because you can't go and run a quote a list of quotes and a list of scriptures and tie everything together in a nice little box don't be afraid don't resist the spirit of revelation don't resist the spirit of revelation allow it to come allow it to be true if there is something that god is trying to get to you i'm going to say 9 times out of 10 probably more it is going to come in opposition of your hybrid spirit so if god is pricking your heart to something or he's pricking your mind to something and he's trying to draw your attention to something and your hybrid spirit is resisting that i would say pay very close attention to that don't resist that allow it to be true i'm not saying go and just believe anything we know we know better than that check it by the word but what i'm saying is if god has dropped something in your heart and you don't see anything in the word that is contrary to that don't discount that allow god to come back into the temple later and reveal himself to you don't be afraid to stand on that don't be afraid to declare that now obviously if something drops into your heart and there's a word contrary to it then don't believe it we know that we're taught we're taught better than that but i would i would say most of the time in my life in your life and through the scriptures most of the time a significant spiritual revelation comes prior to a proper understanding of being able to being able to tie it together in the word and in the message it will it will come as brother brahm says it comes tumbling down through a mystical channel [Music] brother don't get hung up on this saints because this is the scare tactic of the devil if the devil can keep you from receiving revelation he's got you if you're scared to receive revelation he's got you if you're if you're scared to receive something from god before you read it in a message book or before you read it in a scripture you've got a problem and i know that's really straightforward and i know that's uh it's scary to the devil but brother brandon said the same thing happened to him he says i'll be out in the woods and the thought will strike me then he says then i take that thought and i go back to the word and i run it through the scriptures and i make sure it's in the scriptures and i make sure he says when he saw a vision he says i'll see that vision and then i'll take it back to the word and i'll run it through the word you tell me which is coming first brother random's not sitting here reading his bible now we know revelation comes that way obviously we know revelation comes that way by reading by physically reading the message by physically reading our bibles we know that that's a primary source of god revealing himself to us but it's it's so important that we be able to receive revelation through that mystical channel because we have to be able to bypass our hybrid spirit and our hybrid mind and like i said that happened with brother branham all the time he says i will i'll be out in the woods i'll be walking along i'll be doing whatever i'll be mowing the grass and a and a thought will strike me revelation will hit and i receive that but then i go track down in the word so there's nothing wrong with tracking it down in the word there's nothing wrong with with wanting to put the pieces together wanting to put the quotes together wanting to put the scriptures together we should do that but we cannot be scared of revelation we can not be afraid of the spirit of revelation speaking into our lives coming and asking the question will thou be made whole the man did not give jesus 21 questions of well yeah but how well yeah i'd like to be made whole but who's going to do it yeah i would like to but are you are you trying to say you have the power to do that jesus came along and he says without being made whole he just simply said yes but i don't have any man to put me in the pool that was all the understanding that he had right then that was all the understanding that he had was i've got to get into that pool and it wasn't a wrong understanding but before he even knew who jesus was he somehow comes in contact with a revelation that this man has the power to make me whole jesus says take up thy bed and walk and there is something that comes to this man that gives him the faith to do what it's told him prior to knowing who jesus is will thou be made whole or do you have to understand everything first will you allow him to make you whole this morning or are you going to wait until you can track everything down and put it in a nice little box allow him to make you whole saints if you allow him to make you whole he will come back into the temple and show you himself he is not going to leave you out on some wild tangent out in left field with no scriptures and no quotes to support your belief it's not going to happen but he wants you to step out in faith he wants you to step out in the spirit of revelation brother branham said in the church age book he says that was the first mistake the ephesians church made he says they stopped reaching out in the spirit so i'm not crazy for saying those things saints i'm not just making it up i can feel the tension surrounding that because we are we are so trained in denominational thinking that luther came i've got to say what luther said wesley came i got to say what wesley said brother branham came i just got to say what the tapes say that's true but you can say what the tapes say and never say what the tapes say without the spirit of revelation we have to receive the spirit of revelation and again i would always back that up with i am not about to support something that the scriptures does not say this and something the message does not say if you have a divine revelation you're going to be able to find it in the scriptures and in the message don't resist the spirit of revelation that's all that i'm saying don't resist the manifestation of the word in your age that will come along and say wilt thou be made whole he'll bring the proper understanding he will show you where to find that at let him make you whole let him come back to the temple and say this is that i am he go in sin no more the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day starting in verse 17 but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you just relax i didn't mean it it's okay maybe i was a little bit too aggressive oh no he pulled poured fuel in the fire then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever he doeth these things also do with the son likewise for the father loveth the son and showeth him all things that himself doeth and he will show him greater works than these that ye may marvel for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will i mean he's not pulling punches with them saints he's basically said you didn't like me saying that i and my father are one by the way i do everything that my father shows me to do i quit him just like my father quickens he's not backing up on that revelation he just continues to say the same thing different ways for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honoreth not the son honoreth not the father which hath sent him don't leave this 2000 years ago this saying is still true today remember brother graham says when you come to say i and the father are one and these other things the shock will pull away can we come and can we say my father worketh and i my father worketh hitherto and i worketh can we say that what reaction do we think we're going to get you're doing god's work god's using you to fulfill scriptures what reaction do we think we're going to get don't back up on that revelation just do what jesus did verily verily i say unto you the father does not does verily verily i send you the son i can do nothing i can do nothing except for accept the father show with me you mean you have commun direct communication with god brother branham says that jesus didn't do anything until god first showed him a vision he says he walked along god would show him a vision he would go and do it he said he never did any miracles without first god showing him a vision you say well i can't work like that because i don't see visions we've seen a vision saints the scripture says where there's no vision the people perish we've had a prophet come in this day to reveal the entire vision to reveal the entire scriptures we don't need to have our subconscious and our conscience start changing realms and going back and forth to see the vision that we should walk in because we've had the scriptures and now christ will come and he will show us in the vision in the word what our work is to do so now we can come and we can declare the very same thing that i do nothing i do nothing except the father's show with me you say well i didn't see a vision did you see it in the word it's the same thing saints division is the word where there is no open word the people perish where there is no open vision the people perish if you have an open vision you have an open word if you are trying to do what the father would do the father is not going to do anything but what's in the vision what's in the word so if the entire word has been opened to us how can we not declare i do only that which the father doeth i i do nothing unless he shows me first now if you're in worldly entertainment and you're in worldly uh worldly uh sin and you're doing things as the scripture says he that loveth the world the love of god's not even in him if you are involved in those things then don't try to make that statement but you had the opportunity to be able to make that statement and we should the scripture says everything that you do do in the name of jesus christ how how is it any difference to say any different to say i don't do anything unless the father shall with me that's sanctification on a whole other level saints see if you catch that revelation you don't even have to deal with sanctification anymore because it all goes into that it's all included in that if you catch the revelation that i and my father are one and i will not allow my hybrid spirit or my hybrid flesh to do anything except for what he show with me in the word you don't have to go back and be like i don't know if this skirt is too if it's long enough i got to get my tape measure i don't know if my hair is long enough let's measure it i i don't know if i should tell this this collar off collar joke you see what i'm saying saints you don't have to you don't have to press sanctification into yourself the scripture says we're sanctified by the word of god if the word of god is closed to you it is impossible for you to live a sanctified life in the age that you're living in but if the word of god is open to you if the vision is open and you're walking in the vision that the father has given you of what he would do sanctification is not an issue because the father is not going to show you to go do something that's not holy that would mar your sanctification as a christian one is it's at a higher level saints let's get out of a wesleyan age of trying to sanctify ourselves and allow the open vision the open word let's just do what the father show with us to do in the word it will take care of itself that all men should honor the son even as they are to honor the father he that honoreth not the son on earth not the father which has sent him moving into verse 24 john 5 24 jesus said verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation condemnation but is passed from death unto life that's a bold statement that's a statement that we're supposed to make to cause the shock to pull away think of the implications of that saints verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life oh you mean jesus yes oh you mean you're jesus yes brother random says when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things meaning he is giving us permission to say these other things if he wasn't giving us permission to say these other things i would be dares to even think these other things let alone put them on a hybrid corrupt tongue and say them let alone say them before the very purchased purchased product of the blood of jesus christ but let's back up a verse 23 that all men should under honor the son even as they honor the father he that honoreth not the son on earth not the father which has sent him so now if we refuse to say what he that has been sent to us has told us to say we have automatically rejected what the father wants us to do i would rather be declared a radical than i would be declared and know that i'm not saying what the prophet of god has told me to say and as such i'm resisting that message and i'm resisting what he's told me to say and because my hybrid spirit my hybrid flesh is in constant battle with that i just can't seem to to break through and to utter those words if you refuse him that the father has sent you have refused the father when you come to say i and the father are one and these other things verily verily i say unto you unless you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life i wouldn't recommend saying that if you don't know who it is that sent you if you're not comfortable with that revelation that you come from god and you go back to god and that he has sent you to carry out and fulfill and finish his work here on earth today you probably shouldn't say that but if you do have that understanding and you do have that knowledge and you do have that revelation why back up on what the prophets told us to say verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my words so let's break that down a little bit you say well you can say anything that's true i can and it's utterly worthless utterly worthless it's just my opinion unless i am the final voice to the final age which is under the correct messenger and saying what the correct messenger said you say well that's not your words anymore then you're right it wasn't jesus's words either [Applause] see what we're saying saints [Music] we have got to get away from the pagan idea that we are somehow different than god we have got to get away from the pagan idea that the bride of jesus christ is somehow not flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone that somehow when she speaks it's different than god speaking because it's the same spirit and the same principle that would want to differentiate the words of jesus from that of his father if that's true this is true regardless of what your hybrid spirit says it's irrelevant your hybrid spirit will never agree just face it your hybrid spirit will never agree with that which the father saith we'll get to that here in just a little bit it will never do it saints but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't declare it that doesn't mean that it's not true we don't have to bypass and check everything through our hybrid spirit to make sure that it's okay to declare we have to see the vision that the father is showing us and declare that vision from our soul from the sea gene within from our heart whatever terminology you want to put on it as paul said from the inner man who is in constant war with the outer man verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my words as they line up with the revealed messenger for my age which makes me the voice to the final age which makes you the voice to the final age he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life you say that's radical that's too extreme we can't go there i'll just leave you with one question if this isn't true if there are people in sin and there are people in darkness and there are people that are needing to be set free can we agree with that can we agree that there are people that are lost that needs life that needs to be found if you will find me another voice that can set them free then i will back up on this revelation but until you can find me another voice under a correct messenger making them the final voice for the final age like it or not you're stuck with that responsibility and you say well i i cannot live a life i cannot live a life to where i can look my co-worker in the eye and declare to them unless you believe the words i speak to you you will die and be lost you are lost and you will die in your sins unless you believe the words that i speak unto you you will not have everlasting life and your hybrid spirit will tell you that's correct you can't live that life and you know what that's the only thing that it'll ever say that's true i take that back it can say one thing that's true you will never live that life you are incapable of living that life that is true but he that has sent you has made you more than able the word that has come has made us more than able more than conquerors more to come to a point of revelation and a proper understanding to understand i have to declare those things and if we just if we would take the time and as i said i'm trying to slow down i want to go slow because i want to think about these things we've heard these preached for months and years now there's no disputing that this is not new but i want to stop and think about this saints not let it just go in one ear not the other and over the head but there are so many things that we have to say are not true that we know to be true in order not to say this if we can't say this by default we have to say that the message of the hour is not correct because if we can't say this that means that there's another option besides the message of the hour and there's somebody else speaking that other option and instead of saying verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me we would have to declare he that he that hears this other person's word and believe on him that sent him see we think oh well we'll just be humble we won't say that we can't say that that's too bold that's too radical but see saints when we do that there's implications that way as well because if we can't say this we are by default saying that there's another way to life besides the revealed word of the age as declared through the vindicated prophet for this age william brother brother raynham see that's what i say we've got to think about these things we have to under understand the implications one way and the other way it's not just good there's bad to it as well because you remember the scripture says he that will add to or take away from this book his part will be taken out of the book of life that does not mean if i take this bible and a pen and scratch out a word right here that i'm lost or that if i take a pen and i write an extra word in here that i'm lost what that means is if you or me fail to declare the same revelation that this declares your part will be taken out of the book of life now let's go back to this scripture and put it in context verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life why is it that they would get everlasting life is because you're not backing up on the revelation of the book of life and you are not declaring to them that they have to come to you and worship you in your hybrid condition and get words of life from you you are simply stating he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life you are simply saying that you have been a partaker of that life and now as being a partaker of that life by default all through the scriptures it makes it makes you and puts you into a position to disperse that life that was jesus's purpose was it not he said unless a corn of wheat fall into the ground it abideth alone but if it fall under the ground and die it bringeth forth much fruit what fruit what is fruit fruit is life verily verily i say unto you i have caught a proper revelation and understanding of my position in this book and if you will believe what i am saying unto you you can then see your position in the book as well and when you see your position in the book you will receive eternal life eternal life will be imparted unto you you will understand that you have always had eternal life the shock will pull away from your true life and then you will start saying things like you and the father are one and then next thing you know you'll be saying to somebody unless you believe the revealed word for the hour as brought by a vindicated prophet you will die in your sin you will die in your unbelief you say well that's not very palatable you know what jacob have i loved and esau have i hated is not very palatable either don't back up on the revelation saints like i said if you will find me one other option besides you and me as the bride of jesus christ being the final voice to the final age under our vindicated messenger to disperse truth and to disperse life to those that are lost in sin if you will find me somebody else that has a message of life then i'll back up on that revelation but until you do i'm not going to back up on it and i'm going to declare i and my father are one and he that will hear the words that i speak and believe on him that has sent me you can have eternal life i'm not going to back up on that because i know if i back up on that i bring dishonor to my father and i'm not doing what the open vision has declared verse 25 verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live was that 2000 years ago or is that still happening if it's still happening where's the voice and the father himself which hath sent me hath born witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not you say well i've accepted the prophet i accept brother branham as the messenger for the age i accept that this is not that age saints there was a wave sheath and it had to go into the rest of the harvest it's not good enough to be the voice for a former age we have to recognize whom he hath sent for this age you say well we still say what brother branham says yes yes yes but chronologically he is not here which means he cannot speak you understand he is not going to come here in a corporal body and say these other things so what tongue has to utter those it gives us no option if we if we do not believe in who he has sent he says my words not abiding in you so if we declare that his word is abiding in us what does that by default mean he has sent us don't make it any more complicated than what it has to be back up to verse 37 if he hath sent us because his word is abiding in us verse 37 says and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape so now if we declare we have his word abiding in us and he hath sent us now think of the implications now they can no longer say we have not heard his voice nor seen his shape do we agree with that now let's go back one more verse to 36. verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that here shall live see i wasn't just making all that up when i told you you had the power to impart eternal life because if we work this backwards it says the exact same thing let's read it backwards from 38 if we have his word abiding in us can we sing amen to that that means that we are sent of him which means we are his voice which means we are his shape which means we are what the world can see which means we're the voice of the son of god that can cause the dead to live you say oh yeah we've heard all that before praise the lord think about the implication saints because that's the part that's sweet in the mouth the part that's bitter in the belly is if you don't come to this point of revelation and you allow worldly living and your hybrid spirit to default to distract you and cause you to to bring a variance to this revelation you are speaking death to people see the implications see the gravity to the position see how it's so much more than what happened in the garden water baptism in the name of jesus christ long hair long skirts not cussing not swearing not cheating not stealing see the position it puts us in life and death in the power of the tongue life and death in the power of a lived life because we know that's what brother branham said we needed he says we need thousands of lived voices thundering out in this age a lived life is the form and the shape that the world can see that will declare i and my father are one i am the dispenser of eternal life i have the authority i have the ability not within myself but because i'm under the correct messenger for my age and i'm declaring the truth and the revelation as he brought it to us does that make sense that day on calvary 1960 brother branham says now notice the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer to cast out devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the holy ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what calvary meant it took stooped degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of god to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life you'll notice how many times he says this he's not mincing words he's not saying this by accident he means what he says this sick woman laying here i can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but he said greater than this shall ye do i'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a son of god can if you refuse he that the father has sent you refuse the father so if you say that's too much for me i can't go there that's too radical that puts me in a place that i can't agree with that puts the bride in a position that i can't agree with i'm not going to say that even if my hybrid spirit and flesh resisted every day of my life i'm still going to say what he said and it's up to him to come into the temple and declare who he is the life that he lived that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a son of god can jesus said watch immediately where he goes jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain sin you retain to them they are retained we covered that a couple weeks ago but look where he immediately goes back to can a man do that a son of god can whosoever sin you remit how do you remit their sin saints by simply telling them the truth the present day living truth always remits sin always always always it did back in genesis it does in revelation it did when jesus was here it will now present day truth always remits sin because sin is unbelief and if you know the truth and you do the truth i'm getting ahead of myself but who can convince me of sin who can who can say that i'm sinful john 5 39 these are some heavy things we're laying down saints they're heavy things with with serious implications but here's what i'll say to that you think i was bold before and now i'm just going to go crazy on you search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me and ye will not come to me that you may have life i've received not honor from men i'm not looking for honor for men i don't care about honor for men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you these are harsh things this is as we would say this is gun barrel straight saints jesus is not pulling any punches search the scriptures you know what if your life don't match the scriptures i wouldn't tell your coworker at work search the scriptures because he might and then you're in a real pickle you say well i can't ever declare that then because i i know i can't live live that life and if they do search the scriptures they'll find me out you don't have to live in that saints you don't have to live in that brother brandon says this is a bright age he says this is an astronaut age he says this is a light age he says this is a free age you can be free from that you can declare that you can declare that to the people that you see that the people you meet you can declare go search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me they are they that testify of my position it's easy for us to say well yeah go look at malachi 4. right you'll you'll see brother branham's there what about the children in malachi 4. what about the children go go search luke 17 30. you'll see the son of man you'll see brother branham's ministry in there what about the eagles that was on the carcass [Music] who's that go search revelation chapter 10 you'll see brother branham was the one to that angel that was declared those mysteries what about 8 through 11. who was that i've not crunched the numbers so don't crucify me if i'm wrong but i would venture to say that there's more scriptures that testify of the position of the bride than testify of that of the messenger he himself declared that john declared that when he was here look how many scriptures have written about eliezer look how many scriptures are written about rebecca and isaac you say well you're trying to diminish that no saints no there is there is nobody i'm convinced of this i have crunched the numbers on it there is nobody that will hold the prophet into his rightful position more so than i i will never back up on that if you ever hear me backing up on that you will know that i've lost my mind and brother branham says that you can have the holy ghost and lose your mind so i'm still saved but you know that if i back up on that revelation just overlook me and don't believe anything that i say because it's not me talking i'll go on record here and now he is the vindicated voice for this age he is the messenger for this h and through that messenger comes our revelation but in order to honor that revelation and in order to properly place him where he is and where he was we have to accept our position in order for rebecca to truly show she believed what eliezer was and what he said she had to get on a camel accept her position and go marry isaac if i would ever back up on that again don't hate me don't crucify me saying just understand i've lost my mind just just understand he's lost his mind but here and now what is today the 10th of january 2021 i will declare to you that is the true messenger he was the voice of god to us the vision that he declared is correct and if i would ever say anything other than that again just ignore it just love me just pray for me i've got the holy ghost but i've just lost my mind but while i'm in my mind and i know we laugh at that and we say that jokingly but i mean the food that we're eating nowadays brother branham told us it's breaking down our brain cells since there is no guarantee that tomorrow i will not i just will not be a crazy man it's hybridization jesus himself said if i don't cut this work short there will be no flesh saved your brain is flesh he did not say there would not be any seed saved he said there won't be any flesh saved because he knows the effects of hybridization so i would say let's extend mercy to those who have lost their way let's extend mercy maybe they did just lose their mind pray for them i mean what's the harm in that just pray for them if they if they've lost their way and they can't see that open vision anymore if they've lost just the simplest revelation of who the messenger was it's the effects of hybridization it is saints it's the effects it's it is either one of two things it's the effects of hybridization or it's a demonic spirit because even a rational thinking person could clearly identify the prophet in the in the scriptures and his position in the scriptures and and that's not a that's not an outlandish statement because the scripture says that he says the prophets come and you kill him and then years later you recognize that was the prophet so if time would go on saints the whole world will come to the understanding that he was the prophet that look at history they've done it that's every time they've done that in history we just haven't seen time going long enough for them to recognize that but now as i don't know why i'm dealing with this but now why why we're in this hybrid condition and hybridization is coming on so strong and the effects on the flesh and on the mind and the brain cells brother branham says those are real effects and the only thing that can overcome that is the spirit of god the spirit of revelation so it's either the effects of hybridization that have broke that down from the people or it's just a demonic spirit that's possessing them either way we should pray for him either way we should extend mercy to him search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and ye will not come to me that ye might have life i receive not honor from men i'm not looking for honor for men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you he's saying you don't have the love of god in you and it's evident because you won't receive the words that i'm speaking to you you won't go and search the scriptures and acknowledge i am he you don't have the love of god in you because you don't want to recognize the present word for this age jesus was saying this then and it was okay for him to say it then because he was the present word for the h but jesus is still the present word for the h he's simply in another form and in another another shape what is the bride the manifestation of this hour so when people would want i won't say people because again i don't want to put it out there so when your hybrid spirit wants to resist the position that the scripture puts you in just declare to it i knew you would say that because you don't have the love of god in you why would you say anything else you clearly don't have the love of god in you if you would agree with me i would be concerned because you're hybrid and i'm not it can't say anything else saints it can't recognize that because it doesn't have the love of god in it it won't hearken to that true voice because it's not looking for life it's father is death he rides a horse with that name on it he doesn't want the love of god he doesn't want life he's happy on his horse of death he can't declare these things because he does not have the love of god we're going to touch just on a couple more and then we're going to wrap this up you were very gracious to me last time and let me get my long lengthy foundation laid i won't abuse you this morning i'll try not to abuse you this morning i always give myself an out john 5 43 i am come in my father's name i can tell some of you are starting to pick up on this revelation because when i say that you're not thinking about jesus anymore i am come in my father's name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive how can you believe which res how can ye believe which receive honor one of another he's saying how can you believe a man that would receive honor from another man and and that man does not seek the honor that cometh from god alone do not think that i will accuse you before the father there is one that accuses you even moses moses let's bring it present tense there is one that accuses you even brother branham in whom ye trust let's back up i am come in my father's name and ye receive me not i'm to make it real plain i am come in mrs jesus christ and ye receive me not if another will come in his own ministry on his own platform you will receive him if he seeks if he seeks honor for men you'll accept that why would you accept that and not he that's not looking for honor from men but he that's looking from for honor from god but don't think i'll accuse you of anything there's one that's already accused you because you will not accept the position of the bride that brother branham has put her in i don't need to accuse you of anything don't put it out there saints i'm talking to myself i don't need to accuse my hybrid spirit of anything there's one that's already done that and he has already declared your hybrid spirit is not part of that bride position your hybrid spirit will raise up with all kinds of thoughts and ideas selfishness and pride it will seek honor among men it will be much easier for you to accept your hybrid spirit which is seeking honor among men then it will be your true seed and the word coming from your soul which is not looking for honor from men see how close it is saints don't put it out there bring it home discern the spirits within the framework of the true christian church don't think that i'll accuse you of anything hybrid spirit there's one that accuses you even the vindicated prophet brother branham in whom ye trust even the hybrid spirit knows who he is it don't like it but it still know who's he is you say well how can that be look at the devils that confronted paul there was no doubt they knew who paul was there were devils that came and says we know who jesus is and we know who paul is but who are you see i'm i'm not just crazy saying so these things lay in the scriptures we've been taught this for years we've heard this preached for years think seriously of the implications though think of the implications i know who jesus is and i know who paul is but who are you your hybrid spirit will ask you that every day who do you think you are mrs jesus christ you don't believe that well i know you wouldn't believe that because you don't have the love of god in you because if you did you'd believe the words that i said unto you and then you would have eternal life by the way i and my father are one [Music] when he raises his ugly head just step on it i'm not going to preach that because lord knows we've had enough stomping on the devil preaching over the years if you really want to stomp on the devil and give him a black eye tell them you and your father are one brother branham says these people nowadays up here on the platform punching devils and saying all that blue devil over there i'm going to get them and this one's a hairy when i'm going to get them if you really want to hit the devil tell them these other things give them a black eye with i and my father are one and then knock him out with these other things and if you really want to hurt him do that without ever saying a word a lived life will kill the devil not just knock him out not just give him a black eye just not not a bloody nose if you had believed brother branham you would have believed me because he spoke of me you say that's adding to the scriptures is it is it or am i saying what the tape said if you had believed the prophet for the age you would recognize and believe the position that it places you in and if you take away from that you're guilty from taking away from the book of life and your part will be removed and that just makes good common sense if you won't declare that i am in the book of life and this is my position how are you going to be in the book of life and that be your position as brother brainer says you're only saved as long as you testify you're saved you're only healed as long as you believe that you're healed if you believe that you're not in that position you won't be in that position but the same is true for the other if you believe that that is your position that is your position regardless of what your hybrid spirit tells you if you would have believed verse 47 if ye believed but if ye believed not his writings how shall ye believe my words if you didn't believe what brother branham said about me there is no way you're going to believe what i'm saying about me but if you do if you do believe what he said about me then why would it make you hiccup when i say the same things why would you give any attention to your hybrid spirit when it hiccups when you say the same thing about yourself if ye believe not his writings how should you believe my words don't leave it 2000 years ago bring it home today let's do one more and then we'll close is that fair i didn't tell you how long the one more was i'm sneaky like that you have to watch john 6 24 this is immediately after brother i'm sorry this is immediately after jesus does the miracle with the loaves and the fishes john 6 24 when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took to ships it says took shipping but we understand they got on a ship and they went somewhere and came to capernaum seeking for jesus and when they found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when cometh now hither jesus answered them and said and said verily verily i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eaten the loaves and were filled why didn't you just answer my question and tell me how you got over here see jesus just did the exact opposite of what the scribes and the pharisees did they saw a situation and asked the wrong question jesus saw a situation and even though he was asked a question he gave the correct answer that had nothing to do with the question being asked mastermind how did you get over here you come because because you want something to eat not because you saw the miracles let's just deal with deal with the issue here it's it's the issue is not how i got to where i am the issue is you're wanting me to give you more loaves and fishes [Music] i'm not going to get into that because i'll be sure and get myself into trouble ye seek me not because you saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which paireth perisheth but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto him now when i read this next statement remember of everything we've just covered jesus let's back up to the question i got to slow down when we look at this question and answer think about everything we've just said this morning then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto him unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath [Music] sent now we have an understanding of why brother branham would say the true bride doctrine is that the spiritual bride is the word made flesh and blood because if you believe that you're doing the works of god and you are believing in yourself that he hath sent you not 2 000 years ago but you're doing the work of god now by believing the true bride doctrine and believing that you are who he hath sent these things are so simple saints but they are so deep and so profound and the implications that go with them with them cause havoc in our hybrid mind every time we read them but if we will just allow the spirit of revelation to bypass that and allow the simplicity of what the scriptures say and what the prophet teaches us to be true it's simple saints and one just goes right with the other and it ties into the next one and that ties into the next one and that's why brother branham can come out and say in a couple seconds when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things the shock will pull away because he knows if you can say i and the father are one and these other things they tie together so he can say that in a couple seconds and i'll spend months saying it but it all goes back to the same thing if you can say i and the father are one and these other things you are doing the work of god by believing the true bride doctrine see how it all just meshes together it's so simple but like i said it is so profound and the implications that go with such are so radical and so against denominational teaching and and the the thoughts of our own hybrid condition that we we have to do like paul did we have to die every day to allow this to be true while we're here and while we're preaching it and while we're going over it while we're reading it and while we're studying it and while the anointing is here it's like well yeah 2 plus 2 is 4 duh yeah i see it i am he and those other things but then you go to work monday and your hybrid hybrid spirit will a situation will come along and your hybrid spirit will be like no no that may be true for somebody else but not you not the way you reacted to that and that's when that's when we have to stomp on the devil because we have to take the word of god in its simplicity and in its truth and squash that and get back into the vision get back in line does that ring a bell with you what was he telling the bride to do in the vision get back in line saints were not going to be physically marching in ranks and rows and the prophet standing over here screaming get back in line you're six inches to the left [Music] it's a spiritual vision it's a spiritual position you go to work monday something happens you respond incorrectly and you get six inches out of line you have to take the word of god and allow it to say get back in line with the revelation that i declared to you what revelation is that oh i and my father are one who can convince me of sin you know what i'm really glad he didn't say there is who can who can accuse me of bad decisions now he could have said that and it would have been true but he didn't want to say anything he knew we couldn't say in our hybrid condition so he said who can accuse me of sin see if he would have said who can accuse me of bad decisions you ain't saying those other things saints i'm not even going to think those other things let alone say them who can accuse me of a mistake he could have said that we can't say that let's just make it real who can accuse me of doing something stupid he could have said that we can't say that but what we can say is what he said who can accuse me of sin because sin is simply unbelief in the word and even if in my heart musicians come or i'm never going to stop if even in my hybrid condition i have to testify yesterday i made a bad decision yesterday i made a mistake let's not even put it yesterday this morning i made a bad decision this morning i made a mistake this morning brother franco you could appreciate this i did something stupid that's an inside joke don't you all ask i will never divulge you but that doesn't change the fact that i can say who can accuse me of sin because even in my mistakes and my bad decisions and even in my outright stupidity there is not one speck of this word of this open vision that i will not line up with if he in his grace and in his mercy will simply show me where i am not believing and where i am not in line with his word i will repent for that and i will immediately get back in line even if three seconds later i fall out of line again i will immediately get back in line and then when i go around the corner and i fall out of line again i will repent and get back in line because he did not say who can accuse me of bad decisions who can accuse me of wrong who can accuse me of being stupid i know that's a harsh word to use from the pulpit but i'm talking about myself so i'm allowed to use it if you want to use it on yourself that's that's up to you i'm not saying that about you i'm saying it about me but he could have said those things but he didn't who can accuse me of sin and i know i'm speaking to a group of people here this morning that can say that and that believe that saints we in our hybrid condition are going to get it wrong every day every hour every minute we are going to fall flat on our face as brother john said a couple weeks ago when he was preaching the more that i grow in spiritual maturity the more i hate myself that if you want to put a uh indicator on spiritual maturity put that on it because that's the true indicator the more the person hates themself that's they're getting there then they're getting who was more mature than paul and that's all paul could say is i want to do good and i can't i don't want to do bad and i do who will rid me from this body of death in me is no good thing [Music] paul had the revelation paul was in line with the vision paul recognized you know what that vision is true even if i've got to die daily to make it true it's still true i'm going to stop there because if i read anything else we're going to be here for another however long we've been here so praise the lord let's stand together let's just pray together as our pastor would come precious lord jesus lord we're grateful for your truth in this age to us lord father we know in us lays no good thing except that predestinated seed word soul life gene of god that you have placed in there lord but we want to go forward from this day and from this building and from this service with the revelation that though everything else even in myself testifies against that that revelation is still true and that part of me is good and that part of me never fell in the beginning that part of me resisted the devil's lie in heaven and will resist the devil's lie now in my hybrid spirit that would tell me that i my father are not one lord we want to move forward in these things we want to think solemnly about these things we don't want to put these things off on somebody else or for another age but we want to accept them for ourselves so that we can be found faithful as you said we were in the book of revelation that we were chosen and faithful lord we want to be faithful to the vision that you have given us in this day that we can testify i do nothing and i believe nothing except for what my father showed with me regardless of how many times our hybrid humanity would raise up against that we want to testify that i believe nothing but what my father showed me lord would you grant that to us we thank you once again for this time that you have given us to speak of you lord we just pray that you would take these things make them a reality in our lives i pray that you would bless the people lord father if there's sick here would you heal them if they're lost here would you draw them to you lord if there's financial needs would you meet them lord if there's spiritual needs would you meet them if there's emotional needs would you meet them lord and would you meet them in the way that you have chosen to through the opening of your word lord not that some man could do anything to help another man but you can come lord you can come and pick up a vessel our brothers and our sisters and help one another lord i pray that that would be our position to each other and to ourselves we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ the bride says amen god bless you saints let's sing brother [Music] [Laughter] i belong to jesus he purchased me and i'm all his [Music] praise god when i hear brother ben preach and i recognize those things to be true there's one word that keeps popping into my mind responsibility what a heavy responsibility god has called us in these places in this age we didn't do it to ourselves we didn't call ourselves we didn't predestine ourselves he did but he's given us the truth he's given us life we carry with us life we carry with us the message we are amen we are the message on display we are the message the living word and what a responsibility to accept that word to acknowledge that word and to give it unto us if you turn with me let's turn to luke chapter 10 the scripture kept coming to mind [Music] luke chapter 10 verse 16 jesus takes and he sends the disciples out two by two and he sends them into cities to go and preach the gospel of the kingdom and tell them that the kingdom is at hand and he sends them out with a message and they go to the cities declaring the message and he tells them what to do in any home you come and say peace be unto you and if there's peace there then their peace will remain if not it'll return unto you if they don't accept you go out and shake the very dust of the city off of your feet and move on and then this is what he says in verse 16 he says he that heareth you heareth me and he that despises you despises me and he that despises me despises him that sent me see these men didn't call themselves the lord called them these men didn't come up with their own message he gave them the message to preach see if you call yourself and you take a position that's not yours then none of this applies to you anyways [Music] if you don't take the words that he gave you to say and you make up your own words none of this applies to you anyways this only works if you are predestinated chosen before the foundation of the world he's called you into a position and then he's given you the words to say and then when you go in that position and speak what he's given you all of this applies then to you that's why the first revelation is the revelation of who you are the one that's most important is that he called me i didn't call myself i didn't make myself bride you can't take the title of bride unless he has before the foundation of the world called you to be his bride you could say whatever you want but it means nothing but when god has called you before the foundation of the world to be his bride in this end time that you would be the manifestation of the word in this day that's not your choosing that's his choosing and then when he would give you the message through a messenger to say this is the truth this is the vision this is the word and you go forth in repeating that he that heareth you heareth him he that despiseth you despises him and you despise him you despise him to send him why because it's all working in a line all that the father was he poured into christ amen all that christ was he poured into the church and all is connected amen that's why it's so important that this message has come the seals have been broke to unseal who we are amen because we're walking around in spiritual amnesia amen and we're afraid to declare the truth and who we are we're doing nobody else any good but once he's awakened us to who we are what hour we're living in what is the manifestation of this hour now we've got something to go forth and say and when we say that amen those are the words of eternal life that way you can say to somebody the words that i speak unto you how can you say that amen you know you know you're just a human being you know you're just so flawed because you know that's not my words of my human flesh it's not the words of my mind but this is the very word of god that he's given to me and he's given it to me to say he hasn't given it to my neighbor he hasn't given it to the other person or the preacher but he's called me to be the manifestation of this hour because i'm part of the bride and he's called me to say these things and then you can say to somebody the very words that i speak unto you they are the words of eternal life if we would just embrace that not be afraid of that we would allow the fear of the flesh and the spirit to subside and just embrace who he told us we were and to move in with confidence into that role it's the only way that we can help anybody else the apostle paul was no help at all to the gentiles until the apostle paul could get comfortable with the revelation that i am the light to the gentiles [Music] that's a big statement he's taking the scripture right out of isaiah and he's saying i am the fulfillment of that word and when he come into and we come into the city and they rejected what he said he said seeing that you have refused eternal life what is paul doing paul is declaring i am the light to the gentiles you did not receive the words that i speak unto you because the words are speaker to your eternal life when you rejected that you saw yourself not fit for eternal life lo i turn unto the gentiles [Music] if paul would have been wishy-washy on that revelation if paul would allow the doubts and the contradictions in his own life in his own mind amen where would the gentiles that could where would the gentiles be and the corinthians and the thessalonians and those in ephesus and those of laodicea what would have happened to you and i if paul would have not been able to catch the revelation for his day and catch his position in the word and go forth and be bold enough to say i'm the light to the gentiles amen he will judge you by the gospel that i preach [Music] you realize we're not talking about the manifestation of christ in jesus christ we're talking about the manifestation of christ and a fallen human being paul the apostle who's a persecutor of the church who was grabbed at his appointed time and revealed who he really was and he could say that god the world will be judged god will judge you by the gospel that i have preached he says by my gospel why because it wasn't his gospel amen it was the gospel that he'd received on the back side of the desert it was the revelation of the word it was the word of god but it was coming from his lips so he say my words my gospel the things that i have said and that's why you can say the things this is the words that i get it's not my words it's his words but he's he's chosen to speak it through this vessel and these words that i speak unto you they are eternal life amen what what brother ben is preaching is not something foreign to the word it's something right out of the word it's foreign to our minds it's foreign to our spirit realm but it's not foreign to the word that's why that's why the revelation of who we are in this day is so key first the revelation of who is christ who is jesus christ he's the word the word made manifest then who am i i'm the same thing not because i made myself not because i appointed myself not because i agreed because he already chose before the foundation of the world i finally have just come to myself i find myself in a pig pen eating pig slop one day in the world trapped in all the darkness and all of a sudden i came to myself and i realized i have a father i don't have to live like this i will go back into my father praise god and when that young man come back to his father what did he get he said i'm not worthy to be a servant i'm not worthy to be no more called your son make me a servant i'll work for you and he come back and we come back with the attitude sometimes i'm not worthy i i'll just be a servant but he says give him a robe give him a ring amen slay the beast amen he's not come back as a servant this is my son and i've given him a position by the signet ring of power and authority when he speaks it's the same as me speaking [Music] we have to get we have to quit acting pious and religious and and absolutely all it is is denying the word we have to get comfortable saying this isn't pride this isn't arrogance in fact sometimes when i say these things it is absolutely ripping me to shreds because i know the reality of what i am in the flesh and there's no good thing and i know my mistakes and i know my favorites and it's not comfortable sometimes for me to say these things but i say it because it's nothing but the truth and if i allow myself to be be held back and if i allow the manifestation of christ in my life to be held back because of all the things that go on in my hybridization and my my confusion and my doubts and my backslidings and my mistakes and all that then i will never be any good to the people that are around me but i have to deny that as a false life and i have to deny that is is an imposter of who i really am and i've got to identify with the real me on the inside the true me and that's the portion i identify with and that's what i'll speak praise god let's just practice saying what the word says and let god have this way man let's pray [Music] lord jesus we thank you lord for speaking unto us so clearly lord these are things lord these are statements with consequences these are revelations lord that bring impact this isn't skim milk this isn't something to pacify an infant but this is meat lord for eagles for this is an eagle day an eagle age this isn't food for the immature this is food for the fully mature because your bride has come to full maturity god i pray that you would help us to take this meat lord and to chew it and to eat it and make it one with us allow it lord the nutrients from this word to bring forth a life to become manifest in our very life god help none of your bride to choke on this but help him to realize this is meat for me this is the life that i'm supposed to live these are the things i'm supposed to believe god we know that we can't do it lord when we look at ourselves as human beings we know that all we'll do is ruin your plan if we're left up to us so you didn't leave it up to us lord god you sent your spirit the spirit was the birth the seed that's within us and now it's not us living it's you living in us help us to surrender to that life and yield to it help us let that word life have freedom to express and freedom to move and freedom to take over we love you lord forgive us lord for our failings and our wanderings give us the boldness to declare what your word says i pray if there's anyone around us lord who needs the words of eternal life that you would allow us to speak it with our lives and to speak it with our mouths may life be imparted into someone else help us to fully embrace what you've called us and who you told us we are and help us to yield ourselves in a fuller measure to that reality and to walk in it to live in it love your father and i ask that you would move on us as we go out from here let us go different than we came in let our eyes be clearer by the eye salve that you've rubbed into them this morning may we go out with greater strength lord may we be pleasing unto you in all we do and may you accomplish through us what you've intended to accomplish in this very hour in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you saints well i'm not i
