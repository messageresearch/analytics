[14:59] God you promis to be wherever two or
[15:01] three are gathered in Your Name Lord and
[15:04] we're here Lord and we know that you are

[15:49] fallacy of man and the fragility of man
[15:52] we're asking God for your Supernatural
[15:54] anointing your spirit to move and take a
[15:57] vessel of clay and use it according to
[15:59] your purpose and your design to speak
[16:02] your word to the hearts of your children
[16:05] may that word Lord come into us may it
[16:08] take root deep within us and may it grow
[16:10] and bear fruit for your kingdom we love
[16:13] you and we yield ourselves to this task
[16:15] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[16:18] amen man God bless you all it's good to
[16:21] be here tonight while you're standing if
[16:23] you want to take your Bibles and turn to
[16:25] the Book of Malachi we'll read our
[16:26] opening scripture from there I just want
[16:29] to say uh many of you will know that we
[16:31] had originally planned for brother n
[16:33] Johnson to be here we' even uh had a
[16:35] note of it on the overhead but uh our
[16:38] schedule as a family was just too busy
[16:39] with the funerals and all the things
[16:41] that were going on so I called him a
[16:42] little over a week ago and asked if we
[16:44] could just postpone and he understood
[16:45] and that was okay and so we're hoping
[16:47] that we'll still see brother null
[16:49] sometime soon but it just didn't work
[16:51] out this time and so uh uh he'll be at
[16:54] the byc this coming week so if anybody's
[16:57] down there you'll get to see him and
[16:58] bump into do him and make sure you pass
[17:00] on greetings for us if you see him there
[17:03] also I wanted to remind you that the
[17:04] kids service will be this Sunday this
[17:06] coming Sunday back here uh in the
[17:09] afternoon in the sanctuary so we're
[17:10] looking forward to that uh and we'll
[17:13] have a good time together and also
[17:15] wanted to remind you that brother Gabe
[17:16] is traveling to Oregon this weekend you
[17:18] leaving Friday right brother Gabe
[17:20] leaving Friday so I'm sure he'll
[17:21] appreciate our prayers and may we
[17:23] remember to pray for him that God will
[17:25] use him mightily and bless his travel
[17:28] there and back
[17:29] amen let's look at Malachi 4 5 and
[17:36] 6 it says behold I will send you Elijah
[17:39] the prophet before the coming of the
[17:41] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[17:43] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[17:45] to the children and the Heart of the
[17:47] children to their fathers lest I come
[17:49] and smite the Earth with a curse amen
[17:52] God bless you as you're seated may the
[17:54] Lord bless us as we look at his
[17:56] word amen God bless you brother Paul and
[17:59] sister noran it's good to have you back
[18:01] so soon amen good to have you in the
[18:03] service so God bless you and I think
[18:06] brother Ben and brother Aon L's mom is
[18:08] here God bless you it's good to have you
[18:10] back as well so they exchanged a sister
[18:12] for a mother so praise
[18:15] God um as we look at this scripture we
[18:17] know we're very very familiar with this
[18:19] scripture the prophecy out of Malachi
[18:22] which is a which is fundamental to our
[18:24] faith which is something we're all very
[18:25] much attached to but I wanted to look at
[18:28] it again because it's just on my heart
[18:30] and for a subject I want to take the
[18:31] faith of the fathers and I just wanted
[18:34] to look into it and I've been so
[18:36] consumed and so full with the things
[18:37] that I've been looking at and studying
[18:39] over the last few Services especially
[18:42] the the from last Sunday and I just
[18:45] sometimes I get rolling so fast I get so
[18:48] excited I I I get really enthusiastic
[18:51] sometimes and there's a lot of
[18:52] information a lot of quotes a lot of
[18:54] details and and I don't I don't intend
[18:57] to go so fast sometimes I don't intend
[18:59] to go so long and I don't intend to try
[19:00] to pack everything in the world into one
[19:02] sermon but sometimes I just want to slow
[19:05] down and go back and and look at little
[19:07] bites of this again and that's what I
[19:09] hope to do tonight but I can't promise
[19:11] you I won't get super excited and go
[19:13] super fast and fill the whole time with
[19:15] I can't make any promises amen I just
[19:17] get excited and and brother B said you
[19:19] can't be anything that you're not amen
[19:22] but my desire is to slow down just a
[19:24] little bit and talk about these things
[19:26] and I want to talk about the faith of
[19:27] the fathers because we've heard this
[19:29] brother B talks about this that we live
[19:31] in the day that the prophecy of Malachi
[19:33] 4 in the Scripture it says to turn the
[19:35] hearts of the children to the fathers is
[19:38] to turn turn the hearts of the fathers
[19:39] to the children and the hearts of the
[19:41] children to the fathers and brother bam
[19:43] said there was a dual coming of this uh
[19:46] Ministry of Elijah first in John the
[19:48] Baptist as he would turn the heart uh of
[19:51] the Old Testament fathers to the
[19:53] children to the New and Living Way to
[19:55] the to the uh to the dispensation of
[19:57] Grace that was coming upon the
[19:59] crucifixion of Jesus Christ and so that
[20:02] was his part of the prophecy but then
[20:04] there's a comma and then 2,000 years we
[20:06] have a uh the spirit of Elijah once
[20:08] again coming into a man William brandham
[20:10] to bring the hearts of the of the
[20:13] children back to the fathers amen those
[20:15] same children Amen in the first part of
[20:17] the prophecy became the fathers of Faith
[20:20] the Father the Pentecostal fathers and
[20:22] now 2000 years later we are the children
[20:24] of those Pentecostal fathers who used to
[20:26] be the children amen now we're the
[20:29] children and our hearts are being turned
[20:30] back to the faith of the
[20:32] fathers brother man mentions this
[20:35] numerous times I don't even know how
[20:36] many times but if if you're familiar
[20:38] with the message which you all are you
[20:40] you've heard him say it again and again
[20:41] and again but I found that so many times
[20:45] I hear something so often it becomes
[20:49] just a phrase and I take for granted
[20:51] that I understand what it means and
[20:53] maybe I do understand what it means but
[20:55] sometimes I haven't stopped to meditate
[20:57] on the impact or the depth of what that
[20:59] actually means the faith of the fathers
[21:01] so I just been asking myself what is the
[21:03] faith of the fathers it's a good
[21:06] question I mean I've been asking myself
[21:08] it this way is it a collection of
[21:10] doctrines that was lost over time and
[21:12] now been restored I don't believe that's
[21:15] it in itself that's part of it I do
[21:17] believe that because we do know that the
[21:19] true teaching of the apostolic followers
[21:21] was lost through the church ages and we
[21:24] know that it's been restored as brother
[21:25] brandham came to tie up all the Loose
[21:27] Ends Amen to take all those doctrines
[21:29] that were lost amen down through the
[21:30] church ages and the Dark Ages and and
[21:32] restore them back to us but I believe
[21:35] the faith of the fathers is more than
[21:37] just that and uh that's what I want to
[21:39] look at although I'm not rejecting that
[21:42] at all let's go to Acts chapter
[21:46] 2 when we look at the the faith of the
[21:49] fathers let's go to the day of Pentecost
[21:52] and begin
[21:54] there in Acts chapter 2
[21:59] I'm going to begin
[22:01] reading
[22:04] from uh verse
[22:07] one and before I do that I've got a
[22:10] definition I just want to give you when
[22:11] we were back in
[22:13] Malachi 4 and6 when he says he'll turn
[22:16] the heart of the fathers to the children
[22:18] and the Heart of the children to the
[22:20] fathers that word heart you know brother
[22:22] brandham he only quotes this verbatim a
[22:25] few times most always he'll use the word
[22:27] faith in place of heart are we familiar
[22:29] with that it would return the faith of
[22:31] the children or the children back to the
[22:33] faith of the Pentecostal fathers and and
[22:36] this word heart in the old test
[22:38] Testament means the inner man so if you
[22:40] pulled up the concordance and go in it
[22:42] means the Inner Man the mind the heart
[22:44] the understanding and so I think faith
[22:47] is an appropriate translation he's not
[22:49] brother R's not far off the mark what
[22:51] was he doing turning the he's turning
[22:53] the uh Inner Man understanding and mind
[22:56] of the children back to the
[22:58] understanding mind and and Faith which
[23:00] was the faith of the fathers their faith
[23:02] brought them an understanding in the
[23:04] Inner Man and so I believe brother M's
[23:06] right on par like he always is with the
[23:10] words that he uses amen so in Acts
[23:13] chapter 2 now that we're looking at the
[23:15] faith of the fathers Acts chapter 2 it
[23:17] says and when the day of Pentecost was
[23:19] full come they were all with one Accord
[23:22] in one place so I'm going to stop just
[23:24] for a minute and and make sure we stay
[23:26] in the same frame of mind many times
[23:28] when we talk about Pentecost uh uh
[23:30] because we live in the day that's just
[23:33] just seen the Pentecostal Revival
[23:36] there's been a Pentecostal what was
[23:37] labeled a Pentecostal Revival from 1906
[23:40] and brother bandam says it was actually
[23:41] the restoration of the gifts and there
[23:44] under the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[23:46] so many times when we talk about
[23:48] Pentecost sometimes we can get the 1906
[23:50] Revival in our mind and even that
[23:52] Revival who moved in and overlapped in
[23:54] brother branham's time and he was part
[23:56] of that and he went to the Pentecostal
[23:58] people people but when he's talking
[24:00] about restoring us back to the faith of
[24:01] the Pentecostal fathers it has nothing
[24:03] to do with the 1906 Revival he's talking
[24:07] about right here in Acts chapter 2 on
[24:09] the day of Pentecost the day of
[24:11] Pentecost was the it was a a feast day
[24:15] amen for the Jews Pentecost means 50 and
[24:17] there was 50 days after Passover the
[24:20] Passover is when when Jesus was slain at
[24:23] Calvary Passover was one of the feasts
[24:25] of the Lord that was instituted by Moses
[24:28] and that Feast of Passover uh was first
[24:31] uh uh was first uh fulfilled or first uh
[24:34] practiced or celebrated at The Exodus
[24:36] when they were coming out of Egypt and
[24:38] from then in it was kept perpetually
[24:40] every year but then 50 days after the
[24:43] Passover amen you would come to the
[24:46] Feast of Pentecost amen and and that
[24:50] what's called Pentecost here in the New
[24:51] Testament and that's where we are in
[24:54] time Jesus has come he's fulfilled uh uh
[24:57] the prophet see he's he is the Passover
[25:00] Lamb he's come and showed himself to
[25:02] them for approximately 40 days or more
[25:04] 10 days before the Feast of Pentecost we
[25:06] know he ascends on high with all the
[25:08] resurrected Saints and now they're
[25:10] waiting in the upper room amen for the
[25:12] promise of the father to be bestowed
[25:14] upon them and that promise had an
[25:16] appointed time to come and that promise
[25:18] was going to come on the day of
[25:20] Pentecost they didn't know that they
[25:24] were just told to
[25:26] wait so so so on the day of Pentecost we
[25:30] know that the the spirit of God was
[25:31] going to come like a right Mighty
[25:33] rushing wind and the and the pillar of
[25:35] fire was going to break apart and little
[25:36] licks of fire going to be seen over them
[25:38] and there was going to be manifestations
[25:40] but I just when we come back to the day
[25:42] of Pentecost I want to come back and
[25:44] really think about the day of Pentecost
[25:46] because what they received was a an
[25:49] infilling of the Holy Ghost the very
[25:51] spirit and life that was in Jesus Christ
[25:53] was now coming back to indwell his
[25:55] church amen and there they were told to
[25:58] go and wait to T and wait for this
[26:00] promise to come upon them now they
[26:02] didn't know exactly what the promise was
[26:04] going to look like they didn't know
[26:05] exactly what day was going to fall but
[26:07] God knew
[26:08] exactly God was not waiting he knew
[26:11] exactly when this would come but they
[26:13] were told to go and wait and and the one
[26:15] thing that I I want to just point out is
[26:19] there is no amount of fasting and crying
[26:23] and beating on the altar that could make
[26:25] this happen any
[26:26] sooner this was a Sovereign Act of God
[26:29] that God was going to do his appointed
[26:31] way in his appointed time this was
[26:34] something God promised that he was going
[26:36] to give them and he promised he was
[26:38] going to do for them he told them to
[26:40] wait for
[26:42] it right and so it's important because
[26:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[26:47] promise for us if we if we have repented
[26:50] and been baptized in the name of the
[26:51] Lord Jesus Christ and we have the same
[26:53] promise they had but what we must do is
[26:56] wait for it amen wait for God to do the
[26:59] Sovereign thing that we can't do and and
[27:02] we can't listen we can't Strongarm
[27:06] God we have to wait on God to fulfill
[27:10] his
[27:10] promise and believe that it's a
[27:14] promise we're not hoping if we've taken
[27:16] him at his word and we've got faith in
[27:18] our hearts to repent and be baptized in
[27:20] His Name by faith in his word then that
[27:23] same word that we that we had faith in
[27:25] to receive baptism in his name amen to
[27:28] repent from our ways and turn towards
[27:30] him that same faith in that part of the
[27:32] word will produce the rest of the word
[27:34] just having faith in him that he will
[27:36] keep his promise and we will receive the
[27:38] gift of the Holy
[27:41] Ghost so this is where they are on the
[27:43] day of Pentecost they're there when
[27:46] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[27:48] with one Accord in one
[27:52] place and suddenly there came a sound
[27:54] from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind
[27:57] and it filled all the house where they
[27:58] were sitting and there appeared unto
[28:00] them clothing tongues like as of fire
[28:03] and sat upon each of them and they were
[28:05] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[28:07] to speak with other tongues as the
[28:09] spirit gave them utterance and there
[28:11] were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout
[28:14] men out of every nation under Heaven I
[28:18] want you to I want you just to take note
[28:20] uh this is going to become our
[28:22] audience and our audience were Jews
[28:26] devout men uh uh from every nation so
[28:30] they had gathered in for the Feast of
[28:32] Pentecost so they had gathered from all
[28:33] the nations where they were dispersed
[28:35] and they had come from many different
[28:36] places for the Feast of Pentecost amen
[28:39] so God knew when to wait for this
[28:41] sign when he had gathered the Jews from
[28:44] All Nations and they come for the feast
[28:46] God knew exactly when and he exactly
[28:49] knew what sign would get their
[28:52] attention cuz he knew the
[28:55] audience and there were dwelling at
[28:57] Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every
[28:59] nation under heaven now when this was
[29:01] noised abroad the multitude came
[29:03] together and were confounded because
[29:06] that every man heard them speak in his
[29:08] own
[29:09] language and they were all amazed
[29:12] marveling saying one to another behold
[29:14] are not all these which speak galileans
[29:17] and how hear we every man in our own
[29:19] tongue wherein we were born uh parthians
[29:22] and mes and elamites and the Dwellers in
[29:25] Mesopotamia and in Judea and caposh and
[29:28] pontis and Asia FR and pamilia and in
[29:31] Egypt and in the parts of Libya about
[29:33] sirene and and strangers of Rome Jews
[29:36] and prelit creit and Arabians we do hear
[29:39] them speak in our tongues the wonderful
[29:42] works of God and they were all amazed
[29:44] and were in doubt saying one to another
[29:47] what meanthis others mock saying these
[29:50] men are full of new
[29:52] wine amen so so this is the audience
[29:56] these are these are Jews Dev about men
[29:58] that have gathered for the Feast of
[29:59] Pentecost from All Nations and now
[30:02] they're here and God now is going to
[30:05] going to give a sign to these Jews and
[30:08] and he's also going to fulfill the
[30:09] promise that he left so if you can turn
[30:11] with me to John 14 let's turn to John
[30:14] 14 and look at this
[30:17] promise the Gospel of John 14 verse1
[30:24] 15 he says in verse 15 if you love me
[30:27] keep my Commandments
[30:28] and I will pray the father and he shall
[30:30] give you another comforter that he may
[30:32] abide with you forever even the spirit
[30:34] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[30:36] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[30:38] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[30:41] you and shall be in you I will not leave
[30:43] you comfortless I will come to you so
[30:46] now who is the
[30:47] comforter amen amen I will not leave you
[30:50] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[30:52] little while and the world seeth me no
[30:55] more but ye see me because I live you
[30:58] shall live also at that day you shall
[31:00] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[31:03] and I in you so now he he gives them a
[31:06] promise that as he goes away he's going
[31:08] to pray the father to send a comforter
[31:10] who's going to be the spirit of Truth
[31:12] and then he says I'll not leave you
[31:14] comfortless I will come to you amen so
[31:17] now we know who the spirit of Truth is
[31:19] and who the great comforter is but then
[31:21] he goes further and and he says that
[31:24] that day at that day you shall know that
[31:27] I'm in my father father and ye in me and
[31:29] I in you so now he starts to speak of
[31:32] Oneness as now he is in the uh he is in
[31:35] the father and now and then and then we
[31:39] are in Christ and then Christ is in
[31:42] us so if he's in the
[31:45] father and we're in him and he's in
[31:52] us then you're seeing
[31:55] Oneness this is the promise
[31:58] so then when Jesus is departing then he
[32:02] in in Acts chapter 1 he tells them to T
[32:05] in Jerusalem uh and wait for the promise
[32:08] of the Father which I spoke unto you
[32:10] this is the
[32:11] promise so this is the promise that
[32:13] they're waiting for so on the day of
[32:15] Pentecost when it was full come in the
[32:17] go he brought the promise he came he
[32:20] Jesus came back in the form of the Holy
[32:23] Ghost he came back to indwell his church
[32:27] and he did it at a
[32:28] a specific time and he did it in
[32:30] specific way because he knew who would
[32:32] be gathered for the Feast of Pentecost
[32:34] and he happened to know all the
[32:36] languages that would be
[32:38] represented and he knew how to get them
[32:41] to speak with other tongues but even
[32:43] though they were speaking with other
[32:44] tongues he knew how to anoint the ears
[32:47] of The Listener so the ears of The
[32:48] Listener heard they everyone heard them
[32:51] in their own tongue so it wasn't just
[32:53] the tongue that was anointed it was the
[32:55] ear that was anointed too
[32:59] so God was working a sign he was
[33:01] fulfilling his promise and so now let's
[33:05] go to um Acts 2 again let's go back to
[33:09] Acts chapter 2 and we're going to finish
[33:11] this
[33:16] section so when we get to verse 12 it
[33:19] says and they were all amazed and were
[33:21] in doubt saying one to another what
[33:23] means this others mocked and said these
[33:26] men are full of new wine but Peter
[33:28] standing up with the 11 lifted up his
[33:30] voice and said unto them ye men of Judea
[33:33] and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem be
[33:34] this known unto you and hearken to my
[33:37] words for these are not drunk as you
[33:39] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[33:40] of the day but this is that which was
[33:43] spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall
[33:45] come to pass in the last days saith God
[33:49] I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[33:51] and your sons and your daughters shall
[33:52] prophesy and your young men shall see
[33:54] visions and your old men shall dream
[33:56] dreams and on my my servants and on my
[33:58] handmaids will I pour out in those days
[34:01] of my spirit and they shall prophesy and
[34:04] I will show wonders in Heaven above and
[34:06] signs in the earth beneath blood and
[34:08] fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be
[34:10] turned into darkness and the moon into
[34:12] blood before the great notable day of
[34:14] the Lord go of the Lord come I just want
[34:17] to stop for a minute and and say that in
[34:21] verse 19 when he says and I will show
[34:23] wonders in Heaven above and signs in the
[34:25] earth Ben beneath blood and Fire vapor
[34:28] smoke the sun shall be turned into
[34:29] darkness and the moon into blood he's
[34:32] he's quoting Old Testament prophecy he's
[34:35] bringing it into his day because just 50
[34:38] days earlier at the Feast of Passover it
[34:41] turned dark in the middle of the
[34:44] day and if you go to that calendar date
[34:46] in history to that Passover on that day
[34:48] in history when the moon Rose Over the
[34:51] Horizon at the evening of Passover it
[34:54] was a blood
[34:55] moon so 50 days early the sun was turned
[34:58] to Darkness and the moon was turned to
[35:00] blood so he was showing them signs from
[35:03] his
[35:04] day now realize we've had signs in our
[35:07] day in the heavens above we've had amen
[35:10] a pillar of fire that the picture has
[35:12] been taken of amen and it's been
[35:14] verified amen by a researcher of
[35:16] documentation and photography there's
[35:18] also been a picture of a mysterious
[35:20] Cloud taken in the air in our day amen
[35:23] and that cloud has been circulated all
[35:25] over the world Amen and also studied by
[35:27] by scientist you you find out that that
[35:30] that we we're running on Parallel tracks
[35:32] here so as he's quoting Old Testament
[35:34] prophecy he's saying hey in that day the
[35:37] sun's going to be turned into darkness
[35:39] and the moon and the blood and it had
[35:40] just happened a little bit before the
[35:42] Lord praise God so what is he doing he's
[35:47] bringing prophecy to his day this is
[35:50] what Peter's
[35:52] doing now verse 20 21 and it shall come
[35:56] to pass that whosoever shall call on the
[35:58] name of the Lord shall be saved you men
[36:01] of Israel hear these words Jesus of
[36:03] Nazareth a man approved of God among you
[36:05] by Miracles and wonders and signs which
[36:08] God did by him in the midst of you as
[36:09] you yourselves also know him being
[36:12] delivered by the determinate counsel and
[36:14] forn knowledge of God you have taken by
[36:16] Wicked hands and have crucified and
[36:18] slain whom God has raised up having
[36:20] loosed the Pains of the Pains of death
[36:23] because it was not possible that he
[36:24] should be Holden of it for David
[36:26] speaketh concerning him I foresaw the
[36:29] lord always before my face for he is my
[36:31] right hand that I should not be moved
[36:34] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[36:36] tongue was glad moreover also my flesh
[36:38] shall Rest In Hope because thou will not
[36:40] leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou
[36:43] suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
[36:45] thou H has made known to me the ways of
[36:47] life Thou shalt make me full of joy with
[36:51] thy countenance men and Brethren let me
[36:54] freely speak unto you of the patriarch
[36:56] David that he is both dead and buried
[36:59] and his sepor is with us this day
[37:02] therefore being a prophet and knowing
[37:04] that God had sworn with an oath to him
[37:06] that of the fruit of his loins according
[37:08] to the flesh he would raise up Christ to
[37:11] sit on the throne he seeing this before
[37:14] spake of the resurrection of Christ that
[37:16] his soul was not uh left in Hell neither
[37:19] his flesh did see corruption this Jesus
[37:22] hath God raised up whereof we all are
[37:25] witnesses therefore being by the right
[37:28] hand of God exalted and having received
[37:29] of the Father the promise of the Holy
[37:31] Ghost he has shed forth this which you
[37:34] now see and hear for David has not
[37:36] ascended into the heavens but he saith
[37:38] himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit
[37:41] thou on my right hand until I make thy
[37:43] foes thy foot stol therefore let all the
[37:46] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[37:48] ha made the same Jesus whom you have
[37:50] crucified both Lord and
[37:54] Christ so on the day of
[37:59] Pentecost the faith of the Pentecostal
[38:02] Believers when it was first
[38:05] expressed and the in the spirit of Truth
[38:09] when it came into the
[38:12] disciples they Spilled Out into the
[38:15] street being anointed to speak with
[38:16] other tongues and they were speaking of
[38:18] the glory of God that's what everybody
[38:19] was hearing in their own language then
[38:21] when they questioned it Peter stood up
[38:24] to preach being full of the Holy Ghost
[38:26] and as he stood up to preach he started
[38:28] preaching modern events made clear by
[38:31] prophecy I mean we could put that title
[38:34] onto a sermon modern events what he's
[38:37] saying he's saying this is that which
[38:38] Joel said and this is what David said
[38:41] and this is who Jesus was and this is
[38:43] the sign you're seeing and this is why
[38:44] it's come and this is what's
[38:47] happening why because he received the
[38:50] spirit of Truth amen this is the faith
[38:52] so what is the faith of the Pentecostal
[38:55] fathers the faith of the Pentecostal
[38:57] father fathers is this is the day that
[38:59] these scriptures are being
[39:03] fulfilled praise
[39:07] God uh in The Sixth Seal brother bam
[39:10] says the Apostle Peter at the day of
[39:12] Pentecost how he went back in the word
[39:14] and got the word and he said Joel said
[39:16] in the last days these things will take
[39:18] place and this is that and 3,000
[39:20] believed and were
[39:22] baptized what was it he was tying the
[39:25] the prophecy to his day amen he now knew
[39:29] what he knew what was going on in his
[39:31] day something came into him and he had
[39:33] the boldness where he had fear before
[39:34] and they were hiding in the upper room
[39:36] amen now all of the sudden in boldness
[39:38] he comes out amen they they have this
[39:40] great sign and this Wonder that's taking
[39:42] place and when the crowd's questioning
[39:44] it Peter who was afraid Peter who ran
[39:46] away at the at the Judgment of Jesus
[39:48] Christ Peter who was hiding in an upper
[39:50] room Peter now is the one who stands up
[39:52] being full of the Holy Ghost and he
[39:54] starts saying no I know where I'm at now
[39:56] in the scriptures I know exactly what
[39:58] I'm talking about this is that this is
[40:00] Joel this is David this is the
[40:04] scriptures praise
[40:06] God remember we're talking about the
[40:07] faith of the fathers that's what we're
[40:09] being turned back
[40:11] to see let's let's continue reading now
[40:16] uh let's go to verse 37 and finish this
[40:18] up now when they heard this they were
[40:20] pricked in their heart and said un Peter
[40:21] and to the rest of the Apostles men and
[40:23] Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[40:25] said unto them repent and be baptized
[40:27] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[40:29] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[40:31] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[40:33] for the promises unto you and to your
[40:35] children and to all that are far off
[40:36] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[40:39] call and with many other words he did
[40:41] testify and exhort saying save
[40:43] yourselves from this untour generation
[40:46] then they that gladly received the word
[40:47] were baptized and the same day they were
[40:49] added unto them about 3,000 Souls so je
[40:55] they want to know what do we do in Peter
[40:57] first response is
[40:59] repent but we know the crowd the crowd
[41:02] was devout
[41:03] Jews not harlots and prostitutes and
[41:06] drunkers
[41:08] and thieves and amen who needed to
[41:12] repent the religious the religious
[41:15] people of that day who had missed the
[41:18] word in that day now when they were
[41:20] confronted with somebody who full of the
[41:22] Holy Ghost could stand up and say this
[41:24] is that and tie the scripture to their
[41:26] day now they say all that pricked my
[41:28] heart amen the preaching the preaching
[41:31] of Peter pricked their heart and the
[41:32] preaching of Peter was Modern events
[41:34] made clear by
[41:36] prophecy and that's what pricked their
[41:38] heart when he tied what they saw and
[41:40] what had been happening all around them
[41:42] back to the prophecy and saying this is
[41:44] the day this is the time what you're
[41:46] seeing is the Fulfillment of what we've
[41:47] been told that message pricked their
[41:51] heart amen and under that preaching when
[41:53] their heart was pred he said repent not
[41:55] from smoking not from drinking not from
[41:57] adultery repent from your wrong
[41:59] understanding of the word and your wrong
[42:01] understanding of the scripture repent in
[42:03] this day amen that day is repent from
[42:06] your Jewish Traditions repent from all
[42:08] that you have inherited down through the
[42:10] generations repent and now come to The
[42:12] Living Truth in this day it's repent
[42:15] from denominationalism repent from
[42:16] traditions of man repent from your ideas
[42:19] and turn amen and come to the fullness
[42:22] of the
[42:25] word praise God
[42:28] on in the message the invisible Union of
[42:31] the bride of Christ he says the word
[42:32] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[42:35] not work this
[42:37] day oh this is such a good
[42:40] quote we're supposed to turn back to the
[42:42] faith of the original Pentecostal
[42:44] fathers but he's saying the word that
[42:47] fell on the day of Pentecost will not
[42:48] work this day no sir that was for
[42:53] Pentecost this is for the
[42:55] bride the gold home of the Bride so
[42:59] there's another message that's falling
[43:01] in this day the same message that should
[43:04] turn our hearts back to the fathers but
[43:06] it can't be the same word that fell then
[43:09] there cuz the word that fell then there
[43:11] was Modern events made clear by prophecy
[43:13] for that day but we have to have modern
[43:16] events made clear by prophecy for this
[43:21] day so that word won't work in this day
[43:25] this is for the the bride going home of
[43:28] the Bride we got something different the
[43:31] Pentecostals represent that again now
[43:33] he's talking about the Pentecostal
[43:34] Revival from 1906 they represent that
[43:38] because it was a restoration of the
[43:39] gifts some of the same gifts that fell
[43:41] on that day and fell at the outpouring
[43:42] of the Holy Ghost but they represent
[43:45] that but that the word that fell is not
[43:48] for our day there's another word for our
[43:51] day
[43:57] and I just want you to think for a
[44:00] minute the word that fell on that day
[44:02] won't work today we got something
[44:04] different than that this is for the
[44:06] bride for the going home of the Bride
[44:08] but the word that's falling today has to
[44:11] be the word that turns our hearts back
[44:12] to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[44:15] but it can't be the same word that fell
[44:17] that
[44:20] day prise God so it's got to turn us
[44:24] back to the the faith that they had here
[44:26] but it can't be the same thing they
[44:28] heard there it's got to be a different
[44:31] word a different prophecy to bring us to
[44:33] the same Faith but not by the same
[44:37] preaching not the same word but the same
[44:40] Faith so whatever we hear in our day has
[44:44] to bring us to the same Faith they had
[44:45] in their
[44:47] day okay just keep moving the word that
[44:51] fell I I've been reading that over and
[44:53] over this is for the bride the going
[44:54] home of the Bride we got something
[44:56] different the Pentecost Apostles
[44:57] represent that again we're in the bride
[44:59] age no more than the word of Noah would
[45:02] work in the day of Moses no more than
[45:03] Moses law would have worked in the time
[45:05] of Paul here that's right so this is a
[45:08] uh to me this becomes one of those very
[45:10] interesting quotes because we've got to
[45:12] have a word that turns us back to the
[45:15] faith of those fathers there but we
[45:17] can't have the same word they
[45:18] had but we have to come to the same
[45:20] faith prise God Amen I love things like
[45:25] this the Le in Church age from the
[45:27] church age book he said now I I've been
[45:29] reading this the last couple services so
[45:31] you're familiar with this now this
[45:32] messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation
[45:34] 10:7 is going to do two things so it's
[45:37] one messenger fulfilling multiple
[45:40] scriptures and he's going to do two
[45:43] things uh one according to Malachi 4 he
[45:45] will turn the hearts of the children to
[45:47] the fathers so that's what we're talking
[45:49] about and the question is how is he
[45:51] going to turn the hearts of the children
[45:52] to the fathers then he says two he will
[45:55] reveal the mystery of the seven thunders
[45:58] in Revelation 10 which are the
[46:00] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[46:03] it will be these divinely revealed
[46:05] mystery truth that literally turn the
[46:07] hearts of the children to the
[46:09] Pentecostal
[46:10] fathers so now we have to our hearts
[46:14] have to be turned back to the
[46:15] Pentecostal fathers but we can't use the
[46:17] word that fell on their day we have to
[46:19] have a different word what word is it
[46:20] going to be it's going to be the
[46:22] preaching of the seven
[46:24] Thunders the unwritten portion of the
[46:26] word what wasn't recorded in the Bible
[46:29] under those Thunders what what John was
[46:31] told not to write was saved for an end
[46:34] time amen and under the end time
[46:36] messenger in the end time that seal
[46:38] would be open and when that seal was
[46:40] open then those Mysteries that were in
[46:43] the seven Thunders would be
[46:45] preached where under the
[46:49] seals and that
[46:53] event that
[46:55] Revelation is supposed to turn our
[46:57] hearts back to the faith of the
[46:59] Pentecostal father so that we have the
[47:01] same Faith they had
[47:05] amise now remember what faith did Peter
[47:07] have this day this scripture is
[47:10] fulfilled in your eyes that's the faith
[47:13] that he had what faith are we supposed
[47:14] to have this day this scripture out of
[47:17] the Book of Revelations is fulfilled in
[47:19] your eyes this is fulfilled scripture
[47:22] we're here what you're seeing amen is
[47:24] the product of fulfilled scripture what
[47:26] we're here to testify to you is this day
[47:29] this scripture is
[47:30] fulfilled that was the faith that that
[47:33] they had
[47:34] amen praise
[47:37] God so in the Rapture message he says
[47:40] now Revelation 10: 1-7 all the Mysteries
[47:43] are to be revealed to the
[47:45] bride by the messenger of the leodan
[47:48] church so here we have all the
[47:51] players Revelation 10 1-7 that's the
[47:55] coming that's the descending of the
[47:57] mighty angel with an open book in his
[47:58] hand that's the sounding of the seven
[48:00] Thunders that's the Declaration that
[48:02] time is no more and that's the
[48:04] Revelation uh the mystery of God being
[48:06] revealed Revelation 10:
[48:08] 1:7 that is all the Mysteries are to be
[48:11] revealed to the bride that's the only
[48:14] one they'll be revealed to that's
[48:16] right by the messenger of the leodan
[48:19] church he's the only one that's going to
[48:21] do the preaching I mean the only one
[48:24] that going bring the revelation of the
[48:25] seven Thunders
[48:28] so so we know who the messenger of the
[48:31] latan church
[48:32] is but now we got to know who the bride
[48:36] is and the bride's the one who's
[48:38] received the revelation of Revelation 10
[48:40] 1-7 that's who the bride is amen
[48:45] amen praise God then he goes on to say
[48:48] this is the complete revelation of Jesus
[48:50] Christ brother Brandon Pat's Bible so
[48:52] the Bible is the complete revelation of
[48:53] Jesus Christ and the Seven Seals had the
[48:56] mystery hit of what it all was and is
[48:58] supposed to be open in the last day at
[49:00] the leodan age at the end of time thanks
[49:03] be to God that finishes the message to
[49:06] the church that finishes it when they
[49:08] look back and see what has been and see
[49:11] where it's all brought up to that
[49:13] finishes it the age of the
[49:17] church so what finishes the age of the
[49:19] church the opening of the seals finishes
[49:21] the age of the church what finishes the
[49:25] age of the dispensation of the LA La the
[49:27] the Feast of Pentecost that day of
[49:29] Pentecost amen when after Jesus Christ
[49:31] died on Calvary amen it was Calvary that
[49:34] ended it now they're moving into a
[49:35] dispensation of Grace and now on the
[49:37] Feast of Pentecost when the spirit of
[49:39] Truth come upon them they come out and
[49:41] start preaching it what are they
[49:42] preaching a dispensational change we're
[49:44] changing from law to
[49:47] Grace we're coming out of the traditions
[49:49] of the fathers and we're moving to the
[49:51] New and Living Way that's been opened
[49:53] before us by what by the blood of Jesus
[49:55] Christ
[49:57] so that's what's happened well now at
[49:59] the opening of the seals we're having
[50:01] the same event now that finishes the
[50:04] message to the church that finishes the
[50:06] age of the church and it opens up the
[50:08] bride age it's a dispensational change
[50:11] just like in that day they were calling
[50:13] to The Devout Jews from every nation
[50:15] that came for the Feast of Pentecost
[50:17] what were they doing they were calling
[50:18] them out of the tradition of the fathers
[50:21] and bringing them to the
[50:25] children amen Amen to the New and Living
[50:29] Way that was opened by
[50:33] Calvary and now the message in this hour
[50:35] is calling
[50:37] out of Pentecost and World
[50:40] Traditions out of denominations out of
[50:42] churches out of man-made out of Creeds
[50:45] and dogmas out of all of these things
[50:48] and calling us to the bride
[50:52] age amen
[50:57] brother B says in the third seal while
[50:59] he's preaching the seals he says the
[51:00] bride hasn't had a Revival
[51:02] yet there's been no Revival there no
[51:05] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[51:08] yet he's talked before about church
[51:11] revivals there's been stirrings in every
[51:14] Church age there's been
[51:15] stirrings but but he's he's very
[51:18] specific now he says there's no been no
[51:20] Revival to there hasn't the bride hasn't
[51:23] had a Revival yet there's been things
[51:25] going on churches yet and bride was part
[51:27] of that and it was calling a bride in
[51:29] each in each Church age we understand
[51:31] all of those things but now he's being
[51:32] very specific in what he's saying
[51:34] there's not been uh bride hasn't had a
[51:36] Revival yet there's no been no Revival
[51:38] there no manifestation of God to stir
[51:40] the bride yet we're looking for it it'll
[51:43] take those seven unknown Thunders back
[51:46] there to wake her up
[51:48] again to wake her up again when he says
[51:52] wake her up again she must have been
[51:54] awake at one point right this is why
[51:57] we're going back to the faith of the
[51:58] Pentecostal fathers because they were
[52:00] awake right there at the day of
[52:03] Pentecost and shortly after they were
[52:05] wide awake to their word they were wide
[52:07] awake to their place and time they were
[52:08] wide awake to their prophecies they were
[52:10] wide awake to who they were and who
[52:12] Christ was and what had happened in
[52:13] their day they were wide awake to
[52:16] it but they'll take those seven unknown
[52:19] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[52:23] to do what to bring her back to the
[52:25] faith of the Pentecostal father
[52:29] all right let's go to Matthew
[52:32] 17 I hope you can tell I'm I'm
[52:35] intentionally holding myself back God
[52:40] Amen it seems like you can
[52:43] just just just get overly excited I
[52:46] guess Matthew
[52:53] 17:10 he says and his disciples asked
[52:56] him saying why then shall the scribes
[52:58] say Elias must first come in the New
[53:01] Testament Elias is Elijah of the Old
[53:03] Testament same person same word Elijah
[53:06] must come first and Jesus answered and
[53:09] said unto him Elias truly shall first
[53:12] come and restore all
[53:14] things but I say unto you that Elias is
[53:16] come already and they knew him not but
[53:19] have done unto him whatsoever they list
[53:21] is likewise shall also the son of man
[53:22] suffer so brother brandham says Jesus
[53:25] right there is showing you the two
[53:26] comings of
[53:27] Elijah he's showing he's referring back
[53:29] to John the Baptist Eli has come already
[53:31] and they've done what him with him what
[53:33] they listed but he said first Elias
[53:36] truly shall first come he's speaking of
[53:38] the future yes and restore all things
[53:43] and we know that that Jesus is very
[53:44] deliberate in what he's saying amen
[53:46] because of the prophecy in Malachi 4 but
[53:49] also we know that John the Baptist
[53:51] didn't restore anything his ministry was
[53:54] prepare the way that's right so he had a
[53:56] preparing Ministry to prepare the way
[53:59] for the Lord he wasn't restoring back
[54:01] because if he was restoring back he
[54:03] would have to take him back to the law
[54:04] of
[54:05] Moses so his was not a restoration
[54:08] Ministry his was a preparation Ministry
[54:11] but he's saying but Elijah will come
[54:13] shall come first there's coming an
[54:15] Elijah who will restore so there has to
[54:18] be a restoration Ministry what is the
[54:20] restoration it's a restoration back to
[54:23] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[54:26] that we've been talking about Acts
[54:27] chapter
[54:28] 2 so that's part that's the Malachi 4 so
[54:33] what's going to accomplish this
[54:35] restoration it's going to be those seven
[54:38] unknown Thunders
[54:42] amen praise
[54:46] God in the message
[54:49] influence brother says the power of God
[54:52] the end time is here remember the
[54:55] seventh seal is the end time
[54:57] seal so just keep that in your
[55:01] mind the seven seal is the end time seal
[55:04] brother Brenham is the end time Prophet
[55:07] he's the messenger of the seventh
[55:09] seal all of these things are marking the
[55:11] end time so brother R is saying the end
[55:14] time is here he's not saying the end
[55:16] time is coming the end time is
[55:20] here the angel has gathered up the Loose
[55:23] Ends and we're here what Angel the
[55:27] seventh angel which is
[55:29] himself has gathered up the lucians and
[55:32] we're here he's not talking future he's
[55:35] talking
[55:36] present he was a he said amen he was
[55:39] about to write those Thunders he's
[55:41] talking about John now in Revelation 10
[55:44] he was about to write those Thunders he
[55:45] said don't write them seal them up and
[55:47] at that day of the sounding of this last
[55:50] seventh angel seventh Church age the
[55:52] leodan church Age The Mystery of God all
[55:55] about God how that God is not a big
[55:57] bunch of gods but one God and all those
[56:00] other things should be all be finished
[56:02] in that time the great battles back
[56:04] before had got the Loose Ends hanging
[56:07] out it ought to be all wrapped up
[56:09] together in this last age then when that
[56:12] sounds an angel come down and said time
[56:15] shall be no more I'll swear by him that
[56:17] lives forever and ever time shall be no
[56:19] more oh my we are here brother
[56:23] sister we're at the time
[56:27] amen let's let the Holy Spirit influence
[56:30] us to the word of God now that he says
[56:32] we're at that time now what should be
[56:34] happening now let's let the Holy Spirit
[56:38] influence us to the to the word of God
[56:40] let's let God do the influencing in our
[56:43] hearts this is the message
[56:44] influence and not be influenced by
[56:47] others yes sir now that we're at this
[56:49] time amen let's let this Holy Ghost be
[56:52] our only influence not others not
[56:55] Traditions not anything else now he's
[56:57] coming right down to where he was at and
[56:59] Christ is the mystery of God revealed to
[57:01] the individual Revelation one person one
[57:04] man hell is against this Revelation the
[57:06] Revelation to the individual amen that's
[57:08] what we're coming down to he says now
[57:11] let's let's let the Holy Ghost let's let
[57:13] God do the influencing in our hearts and
[57:14] not be influenced by others this ought
[57:17] to put us in action with reverence and
[57:19] humility the pillar of fire vindicating
[57:21] among us again like it was bringing the
[57:24] children of Israel signs of coming is at
[57:27] hand was there signs of his coming at
[57:29] hand in brother rand's
[57:33] day he says the word by the word being
[57:37] fulfilled we see the Promise amen how do
[57:40] we see the Promise by the word being
[57:43] fulfilled what word revelation 10:
[57:46] 1-7 that in the days of the seventh
[57:49] angel the mystery of God shall be
[57:50] finished so word the word by the word
[57:54] being fulfilled we see the Promise the
[57:56] last days he would pour out his spirit
[58:00] so now listen if you go back to the
[58:03] prophecy that Peter was giving of Joel
[58:06] on the on the day of Pentecost when he
[58:08] began to preach he began to talk about
[58:11] in that day I will pour out my
[58:13] spirit is that right the day of
[58:15] Pentecost amen it was the coming of the
[58:17] Holy Ghost the spirit of God was going
[58:18] to be pouring out and now was going to
[58:20] come and indwell human beings and and
[58:23] now brother Brenham is now coming to the
[58:25] end time coming to the to the the word
[58:28] being fulfilled so that we see the
[58:30] promise but he says what's it going to
[58:32] do at the last day he will pour out his
[58:34] spirit because the prophecy was in the
[58:36] last day I will pour out my spirit and
[58:38] Peter was coming and saying Now's the
[58:40] Time For That fulfillment but now she's
[58:42] got to wake up again she woke up there
[58:44] but she went to sleep amen through the
[58:46] church ages but she's got to wake up
[58:48] again and the Holy Ghost has to pour
[58:49] upon her
[58:52] again how will we see the Promise at the
[58:54] fulfilling of the word
[58:56] amen
[58:58] so he said now this is what he said this
[59:01] ought to put us in
[59:04] action with reverence and
[59:07] humility this ought to move us into
[59:09] action because why when it fell upon
[59:12] them in the day of Pentecost it moved
[59:13] them into action Amen in this day when
[59:15] we see the Fulfillment of the word amen
[59:17] it should move us into action it should
[59:20] give us
[59:21] faith in the first
[59:25] seal he says I think now he wrote this
[59:28] but when he started to write these other
[59:30] seven Thunders he said don't write it
[59:32] he'd been commissioned to write
[59:33] everything he seen speaking again of
[59:35] John in the Book of Revelation but when
[59:37] these seven Thunders over in Revelation
[59:39] 10 uttered he said don't write them at
[59:40] all they're they're Mysteries we don't
[59:43] know what they are yet now where's he at
[59:45] in time he's in the first seal he's
[59:47] preaching the first seal we don't know
[59:49] what they are yet but my opinion they'll
[59:51] be revealed right
[59:53] away right because he's preaching the
[59:55] seals this week
[59:57] and when it do and when it do it'll give
[1:00:00] faith for that rapturing Grace for the
[1:00:02] church to move
[1:00:06] out amen when those when those Unwritten
[1:00:11] word those seven Thunders that John
[1:00:13] would not able to write but seal up when
[1:00:15] the mystery of that comes
[1:00:17] forth he says in my opinion they'll be
[1:00:21] revealed right away and when it do it'll
[1:00:22] give faith for that rapturing Grace for
[1:00:25] the church to move move out so what's it
[1:00:27] going to do it's going to bring a faith
[1:00:29] that'll get the church to move
[1:00:32] out to move out of what ultimately to
[1:00:36] move out of this condition and move out
[1:00:38] of hybridization and move out of this
[1:00:40] dimension in a translation ultimately
[1:00:43] but the first step in that is to move
[1:00:45] out of denominational
[1:00:47] systems come out from among her my
[1:00:49] people that's the first move and it's
[1:00:52] going to take this revelation of the
[1:00:53] word to give us Faith amen a Rapture to
[1:00:56] get the church to move
[1:00:59] out
[1:01:02] amen so now brother brandham in The
[1:01:04] Rapture
[1:01:06] message he says now remember in the in
[1:01:08] the days of the seventh angel his
[1:01:10] sounding forth blasting forth the gospel
[1:01:13] trumpet he is to finish all the
[1:01:15] mysteries of God so brother brenham's
[1:01:17] Ministry was a blowing of a trumpet now
[1:01:20] this isn't the seventh trumpets that's
[1:01:22] going to be the Israel amen this was the
[1:01:24] seventh gospel trumpet he was a seven
[1:01:27] Church age messenger every messenger he
[1:01:30] blew a trumpet and what was the trumpet
[1:01:32] he said it denotes a war brought out
[1:01:34] spiritual he brought a revelation from
[1:01:35] God which started a spiritual war but a
[1:01:37] trumpet he says here further down the
[1:01:39] Rapture message he said now notice the
[1:01:41] trumpet is to call together the people
[1:01:44] assemble themselves together for
[1:01:45] something sometimes it announces an
[1:01:47] important person coming he said
[1:01:49] sometimes it calls the war or announces
[1:01:51] an important person coming amen maybe it
[1:01:53] could do both at the same time start a
[1:01:55] spiritual war and announce an important
[1:01:56] person
[1:01:57] coming but here brother brandham blew
[1:02:00] the seventh gospel trumpet and that
[1:02:02] gospel trumpet is an in gathering amen
[1:02:05] the Feast of trumpets the Feast of
[1:02:07] trumpets is an in gathering the blowing
[1:02:09] of the trumpets was to gather all of
[1:02:10] Israel for the Feast of trumpets now in
[1:02:12] the seventh and final Church age trumpet
[1:02:16] amen what's he doing it's an in
[1:02:18] gathering of the people of God what's he
[1:02:20] Gathering them to he's Gathering them to
[1:02:22] Christ under this great Revelation to
[1:02:24] what give them faith to move
[1:02:27] out move out of what he's Gathering them
[1:02:30] from where where is he Gathering them
[1:02:32] from he's Gathering them from the
[1:02:33] Traditions he's Gathering them from the
[1:02:35] false Doctrine he's Gathering them from
[1:02:37] false Christianity he's Gathering them
[1:02:39] out of the denominational and church
[1:02:41] ages and he's Gathering them to the
[1:02:44] bright
[1:02:46] age
[1:02:48] amen now in the first seal again he says
[1:02:52] when there's coming forth seven
[1:02:54] mysterious Thunders that's not even
[1:02:55] written written at all that's right and
[1:02:58] I believe that through these seven
[1:02:59] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[1:03:01] days in order to get the bride together
[1:03:04] for rapturing Faith Lord so the these
[1:03:08] sounding of these seven Thunders are
[1:03:11] supposed to get the bride
[1:03:13] together it's an in gathering it's the
[1:03:16] blowing of a
[1:03:18] trumpet amen because what we got right
[1:03:21] now we wouldn't be able to do it he said
[1:03:24] it's going to take a higher
[1:03:26] Faith there's something we've got to
[1:03:28] step further we can't have enough faith
[1:03:30] for Divine Healing hardly we've got to
[1:03:31] have enough Faith to be changed in a
[1:03:33] moment and be swept up out of this Earth
[1:03:36] so we've got to come higher than the
[1:03:38] church ages we got to Step Beyond the
[1:03:41] limitations of church ages we' got to be
[1:03:43] called out by a trumpet by the sounding
[1:03:45] of the seven Thunders amen by the
[1:03:47] Mysteries being revealed however you
[1:03:49] want to whatever terminology it's all
[1:03:51] the same thing amen when when this
[1:03:53] Revelation strikes it gives the church
[1:03:56] Faith to move out to gather together
[1:03:58] amen for what for the faith that they're
[1:04:00] going to need to move completely
[1:04:03] out
[1:04:05] yes so in the Rapture message brother
[1:04:07] says therefore the message calls the
[1:04:09] bride together see the shout when he
[1:04:11] talks about the Rapture he talks about
[1:04:13] the Rapture as a cycle the Rapture is
[1:04:15] not a momentary event we know there's a
[1:04:17] culmination that's the change in the
[1:04:19] body and the meeting in the air but the
[1:04:20] change in the body meeting in the air is
[1:04:22] preceded amen by a Rapture cycle that
[1:04:25] brings us to the this point in time and
[1:04:26] it starts with a shout and moves to a
[1:04:28] voice of the Archangel amen and then the
[1:04:30] Trump of God which that trumpet is an
[1:04:33] end Gathering what Gathering Gathering
[1:04:35] all the way
[1:04:36] home because a trumpet is a gathering
[1:04:40] calling the people in assembly so he
[1:04:43] takes that out of 1 Thessalonians 4:15
[1:04:46] where he says for this we say unto you
[1:04:48] by the word of the Lord that we which
[1:04:49] are alive and remain until the coming of
[1:04:51] the Lord shall not prevent them which
[1:04:52] are asleep for the Lord himself shall
[1:04:56] descend from heaven with a shout yes
[1:04:59] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[1:05:01] the Trump of God there's your three
[1:05:03] phases to the rapture we could put it
[1:05:05] that way brother B brings us out in the
[1:05:06] Rapture message but as the Lord descends
[1:05:10] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:05:12] heaven and when the Lord descends from
[1:05:15] Heaven the first thing that he does he
[1:05:17] descends with a shout what is the shout
[1:05:20] it's the message going forth to gather
[1:05:22] the bride to gather the elect and so
[1:05:25] what that that's that last final gospel
[1:05:28] trumpet blowing that's the in gathering
[1:05:30] out of the church into the bride AE
[1:05:33] separated from traditions and it's so
[1:05:35] very similar to the day of Pentecost
[1:05:37] when that gospel trumpet
[1:05:41] blew
[1:05:43] amen modern events made clear by
[1:05:46] prophecy he says we're not living in a
[1:05:49] Pentecostal age we're living in another
[1:05:51] age and brother R says the lat in church
[1:05:53] age is the Pentecostal age
[1:05:56] we're living in another age see we're
[1:05:57] not living in a Methodist age we're
[1:05:59] living in another age we're living on up
[1:06:01] here to the bride age the calling out of
[1:06:05] the church and getting it together for
[1:06:07] the
[1:06:09] Rapture what what message is this modern
[1:06:12] events made clear by prophecy what are
[1:06:14] the modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:06:16] all of these things that were prophesied
[1:06:17] to happen they're happening and what are
[1:06:19] they supposed to be doing calling out
[1:06:21] the church and getting it together for
[1:06:23] the Rapture amen that's the age that
[1:06:26] we're now living to my honest opinion
[1:06:28] that's exactly the
[1:06:30] truth now in the Feast of trumpets now I
[1:06:32] know I'm reading a lot of quotes so
[1:06:34] please just hang with me but these
[1:06:35] things these things that I don't want to
[1:06:37] take the authority to say myself I want
[1:06:38] to know that the prophet said these
[1:06:40] things Amen in the Feast of trumpets he
[1:06:42] said there was three stages of it now
[1:06:45] what he's talking about is three stages
[1:06:47] of the church ages there was the
[1:06:49] martyr's age that was the early age amen
[1:06:52] uh when when the church when the false
[1:06:54] Vine began to p Ute the True Vine all
[1:06:56] the way back in the first age it began
[1:06:58] so starting with the first age was the
[1:07:00] martyr's age and that came all the way
[1:07:02] down to the Dark Ages amen where
[1:07:04] martyrdom hit its
[1:07:06] peak so the first stage of the church
[1:07:09] Ages was the martyr's
[1:07:11] age the then the stage of the
[1:07:14] reformers and the reformers was coming
[1:07:17] out of the Dark Ages and trying to
[1:07:18] reform the Church out of Catholicism and
[1:07:20] bring back the word and it came through
[1:07:22] three stages it came through Luther
[1:07:24] Wesley and Pentecost the Pentecostal
[1:07:26] Revival was part of the
[1:07:30] Reformation then the stage of the
[1:07:32] reformers and now the calling out
[1:07:39] time so what is the bride age the
[1:07:42] calling out
[1:07:44] time what were the seven Thunders
[1:07:46] supposed to do call us out what was the
[1:07:48] revelation of the Mysteries being
[1:07:50] revealed to do the opening of the seals
[1:07:51] call us
[1:07:53] out this is the falling out
[1:07:56] time when finished at leodan age
[1:08:00] according to Revelation 10 the mystery
[1:08:02] of all the Bible would be known to the
[1:08:05] bride is that right Revelation 10 listen
[1:08:09] close now um bride called out by the
[1:08:12] word Christ himself calling out the
[1:08:15] bride making plain Hebrews 138 that he's
[1:08:19] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:08:21] does the same is the same amen so who's
[1:08:23] calling out the bride amen it's Christ
[1:08:26] calling out the bride how is Christ
[1:08:28] calling out the bride by revealing the
[1:08:30] Mysteries by opening the word because
[1:08:32] Christ is the anointed word and it's the
[1:08:36] anointed word that is calling us out
[1:08:38] amen the revealing of the Mysteries that
[1:08:41] we hidden and revealed till the end time
[1:08:43] what's it do it's calling us out amen
[1:08:46] and that is Christ calling to his
[1:08:49] bride by his
[1:08:51] word now in the anointed ones at the end
[1:08:54] time says now the very day when this
[1:08:58] messenger not when he starts on but when
[1:09:01] he begins to declare his
[1:09:04] message so now he's telling you that
[1:09:07] when the messenger starts on he's going
[1:09:09] to go into the three pools now he's
[1:09:11] going to go into the the first part of
[1:09:13] the ministry with was laying his hands
[1:09:15] on and having a sign in the hand then
[1:09:16] the discernment amen and then there's
[1:09:18] going to be a third pull but he's saying
[1:09:21] not when he starts on but when he begins
[1:09:24] to declare his message
[1:09:26] the first pull healing second pull
[1:09:28] prophesying third pull the opening of
[1:09:31] the word the Mysteries
[1:09:33] revealed no more there's no more higher
[1:09:36] order to reveal the word than prophets
[1:09:38] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:09:39] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:09:41] the third pull was the opening of them
[1:09:43] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:09:45] that's been sealed in the word do you
[1:09:48] see it I want to with all of my heart
[1:09:50] Lord give me the
[1:09:52] eyesight so I read this because I want
[1:09:55] to go back to the prophecy or to the
[1:09:58] vision brother bham has at the end of
[1:10:00] 1955 where we get the term three
[1:10:04] pools because remember in the vision
[1:10:06] we've been through it before but if
[1:10:07] you'll just forgive me for going slow I
[1:10:09] don't want to lose anybody by just
[1:10:11] hammering all these details
[1:10:13] out in the in the vision he was fishing
[1:10:16] he was by L fishing and there was
[1:10:19] Brethren all around ministers all around
[1:10:21] fishing and they were all catching
[1:10:22] little fish amen but he could see in the
[1:10:24] deep water was rainbow trout and the
[1:10:27] rainbow trout rainbow is a sign of the
[1:10:29] Covenant when God put a a rainbow in the
[1:10:32] uh Sky After the flood it was a covenant
[1:10:33] he would never destroy the Earth with a
[1:10:36] flood again so these fish are Covenant
[1:10:38] fish these are special fish and he said
[1:10:41] they're big ones and they're in the deep
[1:10:43] water and he thinks he said I thought to
[1:10:46] myself I think I can catch them so he
[1:10:50] begins the three PS are the tactics of
[1:10:53] fishing so he throws the lure out and he
[1:10:56] gives it a little pull when he gives it
[1:10:58] a pull it attracts the little fish now
[1:11:02] the fish represent
[1:11:03] people right it catches it attracts the
[1:11:07] attention all the little fish run to the
[1:11:08] lure is what brother benam
[1:11:10] says and that was the healing the sign
[1:11:14] in the hand when he went forth it was a
[1:11:16] sign people could see Supernatural was
[1:11:18] God and attracted so many people
[1:11:20] yes and the second tactic of fishing
[1:11:23] once all the little fish uh all the
[1:11:25] little fish gather around then you pull
[1:11:27] it again he said when you pull it again
[1:11:29] that scares some of the little fish away
[1:11:32] and that was the discernment the
[1:11:34] prophesying that's when they started to
[1:11:36] think you're reading people's minds
[1:11:37] that's telepathy and it scared away some
[1:11:39] of the little fish and when they
[1:11:40] scattered that got the attention of the
[1:11:42] big fish the ones that he was actually
[1:11:45] [Applause]
[1:11:47] targeting and they moved up to the lure
[1:11:50] amen but the third pull was the third
[1:11:53] time that he was going to pull which was
[1:11:55] the the time that he was actually going
[1:11:56] to set the hook into the jaw of the
[1:11:58] targeted species the the giant rainbow
[1:12:01] trout the Covenant fish the children of
[1:12:04] God that he was trying to catch and what
[1:12:06] was the third pull it was the opening of
[1:12:09] the word the revealing of the Mysteries
[1:12:11] that was what he was going to do to hook
[1:12:14] the fish the people of God and then once
[1:12:16] he hooked them what was the whole
[1:12:18] purpose the whole purpose was to bring
[1:12:20] them back
[1:12:21] again a restoration to retrieve them
[1:12:24] amen to bring them back to catch
[1:12:28] themen to turn the hearts of the
[1:12:31] children back to the fathers it was a
[1:12:34] bringing back it was pulling out it was
[1:12:36] a retrieving back to
[1:12:40] God see there's the the message is
[1:12:44] simple but my goodness if you think of
[1:12:47] the ways brother brandham described it
[1:12:48] and try to put it all in one you've got
[1:12:50] three pools and and you've got church
[1:12:52] ages and a bride age and then you've got
[1:12:55] uh Thunders and you've got seals and and
[1:12:57] all the ways that he tried to explain it
[1:12:59] if I would just put it all on paper it'd
[1:13:01] be like it just fill volumes of paper
[1:13:04] and the things that he did but he's
[1:13:05] always trying to get us to one
[1:13:07] understanding all of these things are
[1:13:09] trying to drive us to one understanding
[1:13:11] to get one picture to see one thing
[1:13:16] clearly that what's that one thing is
[1:13:18] God is trying to get his children and
[1:13:21] bring them back to their original
[1:13:22] position as a gentile as a as a bride
[1:13:25] amen and that they were they started out
[1:13:27] in Pentecost before they went to the
[1:13:28] church ages and fell away from the word
[1:13:30] they never went on to the full
[1:13:34] Revelation
[1:13:35] okay let's keep
[1:13:40] going modern events made clear by
[1:13:42] prophecy again so we're not living in
[1:13:44] the Methodist age the Baptist age we're
[1:13:46] living in the bride Age The
[1:13:49] Calling bringing back to God through a
[1:13:52] channel that he promised to bring it
[1:13:54] back in
[1:13:56] what is the bride age it's a bringing
[1:13:59] back to God through a channel what's the
[1:14:01] channel the third pool what's the third
[1:14:03] pull the opening of the word the
[1:14:05] revealing of the
[1:14:07] Mysteries this is why when brother benam
[1:14:09] was in Sabino Canyon before he meets the
[1:14:12] constellation of angels he's up there in
[1:14:13] about January hand in the air praying
[1:14:15] sword strikes his hand the voice says
[1:14:18] this the king sword and he says there's
[1:14:20] only one sword of the king amen and
[1:14:22] that's the word am what is it the word
[1:14:26] coming to him what word the one that's
[1:14:28] not been interpreted yet the White Rock
[1:14:30] all the see these are all terms if I
[1:14:33] start just lacing through them like that
[1:14:35] our head's going to be spinning so I
[1:14:36] don't want to do that I'm trying hard
[1:14:37] not to do that but I want us to catch
[1:14:39] the picture all of that is bringing us
[1:14:42] to one thing he's trying to use the
[1:14:44] opening of the word to call his bride
[1:14:47] back to her
[1:14:49] position that's when he talks about a
[1:14:52] White Rock Under The Rock and he talks
[1:14:54] about a third thir pool when he talks
[1:14:56] about seven Thunders and Seven Seals all
[1:14:58] of these things when he talks about the
[1:14:59] end time the end time seal all of these
[1:15:02] things are denoting the same thing all
[1:15:04] of it is God trying by the opening of
[1:15:07] the word Christ calling to his bride
[1:15:09] amen he's trying by the opening of the
[1:15:12] word to bring his bride back to the
[1:15:15] faith of the Pentecostal
[1:15:18] fathers praise God Amen back to her
[1:15:21] original position
[1:15:26] now in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:15:29] revealed he says now
[1:15:32] notice god making himself known now
[1:15:36] we're not supposed to make converts to
[1:15:38] Christ by a
[1:15:39] government but by the Revelation the
[1:15:42] Christ in you as God was in Christ amen
[1:15:46] now this is where I want to pay some
[1:15:48] real close attention so if you weren't
[1:15:50] paying attention before pay attention
[1:15:52] now pent your neighbor
[1:15:58] all
[1:16:00] right you don't make commer to
[1:16:02] Christianity by a government but by the
[1:16:06] Revelation the Christ in
[1:16:09] you so now we're coming to a higher
[1:16:13] Revelation it's Christ in
[1:16:16] you as God was in
[1:16:18] Christ as God was in Christ Christ in
[1:16:22] you when what God did in Christ Christ
[1:16:25] does in you what signs did God God in
[1:16:27] Christ Christ does in you oh isn't that
[1:16:30] wonderful oh my I like that Jesus said
[1:16:34] at that day then brother B said that's
[1:16:37] this day he's getting ready to go back
[1:16:40] to the to to where we read from John 14
[1:16:44] when Jesus Promised the coming of a
[1:16:46] comforter the spirit of Truth and he
[1:16:49] said I won't leave you comforter I'll
[1:16:50] come to you and in that day in that day
[1:16:53] you'll know that I am in the father I uh
[1:16:58] I in you and you in me amen yes I may
[1:17:01] get that wrong but one thing I want you
[1:17:02] to know is it's all
[1:17:04] together how many ever times I say it
[1:17:06] wrong we get the same
[1:17:09] picture and and that was what Jesus
[1:17:12] Jesus laid that down as he was getting
[1:17:14] ready to depart from his disciples and
[1:17:17] he says now I'm going away but I pray
[1:17:19] the father he's going to send you
[1:17:20] another
[1:17:21] comforter and he says then that
[1:17:23] comforter is going to be the spirit of
[1:17:24] truth and he says in other places that
[1:17:26] he'll lead and guide you into all truth
[1:17:28] he'll take the things I spoke to you and
[1:17:29] bring it to your remembrance and he show
[1:17:30] you things to come so he's showing that
[1:17:32] this spirit is going to bring you
[1:17:33] revelation of the
[1:17:35] word and then he says but I won't leave
[1:17:39] you comfortless I will come to you amen
[1:17:43] and in that day that I come to you
[1:17:45] you'll know that I am in the father you
[1:17:49] in me and I in you amen so there's a
[1:17:53] Oneness between the father in Christ and
[1:17:57] the
[1:17:58] believer and so then when Jesus
[1:18:01] resurrects from the dead is seen of his
[1:18:03] disciples he gathers them together he
[1:18:05] speaks to them right before he leaves in
[1:18:06] Acts chapter 1 he says tear you in
[1:18:09] Jerusalem and wait for the promise of
[1:18:11] the father that I spoke to you about
[1:18:15] what is the promise of the father he
[1:18:16] spoke to him about this was the promise
[1:18:18] that the comforter is coming that's
[1:18:21] right he he said it many ways in many
[1:18:24] ways he said my father will come to you
[1:18:26] and I will come to you and we'll make
[1:18:28] our abod in
[1:18:29] you all right now brother Brandon is
[1:18:33] preaching Christ is the mystery of God
[1:18:34] reveal after the opening of The Seven
[1:18:36] Seals and he's talking about the day in
[1:18:38] which we live in today and he's going to
[1:18:40] grab the same scripture amen and he's
[1:18:43] going to bring the same scripture to a
[1:18:45] fulfillment
[1:18:47] today he said Jesus said at that day
[1:18:50] that's this
[1:18:51] day at that day when when this
[1:18:54] Revelation is made
[1:18:56] known you will know that I am in the
[1:18:59] father and the father in me I in you and
[1:19:02] you in me Hallelujah when the Revelation
[1:19:05] is made manifest at that day you shall
[1:19:08] know that I and the father are one I am
[1:19:10] in the father and the father is in me
[1:19:13] then when the revelations comes forth
[1:19:15] then it's I in you and you in me there
[1:19:17] you are see the manifold threefold
[1:19:20] manifestation what for what for to bring
[1:19:23] it back praise God back to what back to
[1:19:27] what it was at
[1:19:31] Pentecost praise God
[1:19:35] am now oh God help me I get so fooled
[1:19:40] that I don't know how to bring it out it
[1:19:41] just gets so full so you're going to
[1:19:43] have to bring it out work a little
[1:19:44] harder
[1:19:45] now praise
[1:19:47] God at that day at the Feast of
[1:19:51] Pentecost that's right when they were
[1:19:53] hiding in the upper room when they were
[1:19:55] afraid of the Jews when they weren't
[1:19:58] certain what to do when they had this
[1:20:00] confusion now they're waiting and they
[1:20:01] don't know exactly what they're waiting
[1:20:02] for they don't exactly what it's going
[1:20:03] to look like don't what it's going to
[1:20:05] happen and then they're nervous about
[1:20:06] the authorities and they've got all this
[1:20:08] going on listen at that day they knew
[1:20:11] that he was in the father and the father
[1:20:13] was in
[1:20:14] him they knew that they knew he was the
[1:20:17] Messiah they knew he was the son of the
[1:20:19] Living God they knew he alone had the
[1:20:21] words of eternal life they knew he had
[1:20:23] died and and that he had resurrected and
[1:20:26] that he ascended on
[1:20:28] high they knew all of that they had
[1:20:31] faith in all of that they witnessed to
[1:20:33] that and they believed it
[1:20:38] all but it seems like they needed
[1:20:41] something a little higher in the
[1:20:43] Revelation because that Revelation had
[1:20:46] them hiding that Revelation had them
[1:20:48] uncertain that Revelation I mean still
[1:20:50] had Peter going back to fishing and all
[1:20:52] kinds of stuff but they needed the next
[1:20:54] step in the Revelation and that next
[1:20:56] step in the Revelation would come in
[1:20:59] that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:21:01] father you and me and I in you now
[1:21:04] you're part of the mystery you're part
[1:21:06] of the plan what changed at Pentecost at
[1:21:09] Pentecost God by filling them with his
[1:21:12] Spirit made them the Fulfillment of the
[1:21:15] word and part of the prophecy then they
[1:21:17] rush out with boldness then they know
[1:21:20] the word then they speak the word then
[1:21:22] they preach with boldness then they look
[1:21:24] into then they look into the lame man
[1:21:26] that says look unto
[1:21:30] us look unto us why they're now part of
[1:21:34] it it's inside of them they're in Christ
[1:21:37] and Christ is in them and it changes
[1:21:39] everything for
[1:21:41] themall and at this day amen at that day
[1:21:44] that's this
[1:21:46] day prise God I'm going to read that
[1:21:50] again brother said Jesus said at that
[1:21:51] day that's this day
[1:21:55] amen now we're bringing now now we're
[1:21:56] not leaving it back 2,000 years ago but
[1:22:00] God's going to do the same thing to
[1:22:02] bring us right back to their
[1:22:05] condition at that day that's this day at
[1:22:08] that day when when the Revelation is
[1:22:11] made
[1:22:12] known you will know that I am in the
[1:22:16] father and the father in
[1:22:18] me
[1:22:20] amen we believe that he died and he
[1:22:23] resurrected he sit in my 4 there was a
[1:22:25] prophet we believe all of those things
[1:22:28] but there's something we need just a
[1:22:29] little bit
[1:22:31] higher he said I and you and you and me
[1:22:34] he said when the Revelation is made
[1:22:36] manifest at that day you shall know that
[1:22:38] I and the father are one I am in the
[1:22:41] father and the father in me then when
[1:22:44] the Revelation comes forth then it's I
[1:22:47] in you and you in me that's why brother
[1:22:50] bandom starts this message with Christ
[1:22:52] the you Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:22:56] why because that's the restoration back
[1:22:58] to the faith of the fathers when they
[1:23:00] come on the day of Pentecost they knew
[1:23:02] Jesus was the son of God they knew he
[1:23:04] had the words of eternal life they knew
[1:23:05] he and the father were one they knew he
[1:23:07] had died on Calvary they knew he had
[1:23:09] resurrected back to life they knew there
[1:23:11] was a resurrection of the sleeping
[1:23:12] Saints they knew they had ascended on
[1:23:14] high they knew all of that but there was
[1:23:16] something else they needed to know they
[1:23:18] needed to know that that was now in them
[1:23:21] and they're part of this whole thing
[1:23:24] praise God Amen praise
[1:23:28] God you can see this
[1:23:32] Revelation is revealed only to his
[1:23:36] beloved
[1:23:39] bride
[1:23:42] why
[1:23:44] why maybe she needs to be called out by
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:48] Revelation to have enough Faith to come
[1:23:51] out in the rapture
[1:23:55] maybe she needs to have enough Faith to
[1:23:57] separate and
[1:24:00] recognize I am the
[1:24:03] bride I am the bride it's me that's the
[1:24:08] that prophet's talking about me the
[1:24:09] message is speaking of me it's me Mama
[1:24:11] it's me that's the one that I see amen
[1:24:14] there has to be something that this
[1:24:15] Revelation does to the individual to
[1:24:19] call them out and bring them to a
[1:24:21] greater Faith what to do to bring them
[1:24:23] back again
[1:24:24] amen amen praise God now in the
[1:24:29] Masterpiece brother says it's because
[1:24:31] the bride and the bridegroom are one she
[1:24:33] is a smitten piece off of him there is
[1:24:35] the
[1:24:37] Masterpiece what is it it's the
[1:24:38] Revelation we're part of
[1:24:41] Christ Michelangelo could not reproduce
[1:24:44] that again he could not put it back he's
[1:24:46] talking about when he struck a piece off
[1:24:47] of his great Moses sculptor he could
[1:24:49] never put it back he said but God is
[1:24:52] going to do it amen he is going to bring
[1:24:54] his little bride that's smitten right
[1:24:57] back to the side of the original

[1:25:41] happened Malachi 4 is to bring back back
[1:25:45] to the original oh yeah the faith of the
[1:25:49] Pentecostal fathers when they could
[1:25:51] stand out there and say this day this
[1:25:53] scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and
[1:25:55] guess what if you want to know where
[1:25:57] it's at look on us amen he's filled us

[1:26:21] original isn't it amazing that on the
[1:26:23] day of pent gos when Peter stood up and
[1:26:26] he quoted he first quoted from
[1:26:29] Joel his first quote was from Joel this
[1:26:32] is that which is spoken by the prophet
[1:26:33] of
[1:26:34] Joel now when brother Brenham comes to
[1:26:36] the Masterpiece he shows now there's
[1:26:39] another prophecy laying in
[1:26:41] Joel there was one prophecy for 2,000
[1:26:45] years ago there's another prophecy that
[1:26:48] is span 2,000 years and coming to
[1:26:50] culmination in our time and it's another
[1:26:52] prophecy and the day that the re
[1:26:54] revealing of the word is going to bring
[1:26:55] us back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[1:26:57] fathers there's another prophecy in Joel
[1:26:59] that a prophet in our day is going to
[1:27:00] stand up and tell us and that's the
[1:27:02] prophecy of all that the cankerworm and
[1:27:04] the caterpillar and the Palmer worm and
[1:27:05] the Locust has eaten what's that they
[1:27:08] that's that Roman bug that eat it down
[1:27:09] through seven Church ages that destroyed
[1:27:11] the truth of the word the original
[1:27:13] Apostolic teaching and ruined the faith
[1:27:15] of the fathers and brought it down to
[1:27:16] nothing and restored it back through
[1:27:18] three stages in the fourth stage which
[1:27:20] is life which is word amen what's he
[1:27:22] going to do I will restore sayeth the
[1:27:25] Lord restore what restore my bride back
[1:27:28] to what she was before these ganker
[1:27:30] worms started eating at it where's that
[1:27:33] prophecy in Joel it starts off with Joel
[1:27:35] it ends with Joel God what is Malachi 4
[1:27:39] going to do bring us back back to where
[1:27:42] back to the side of the word when it
[1:27:43] first came forth before it was
[1:27:46] tainted back to Union with Christ back
[1:27:49] to a bride age what did she come out she
[1:27:52] came out of Pentecost a virgin Bride for
[1:27:55] Christ but be in the first age she was
[1:27:57] already a fallen woman because she had
[1:27:59] taken the denominational ideas of man
[1:28:02] amen so what's he bringing her back to
[1:28:04] he's bringing her back by the BL washing
[1:28:06] of the bleeding word what's he doing
[1:28:08] he's restoring her back by washing away
[1:28:11] all the false all the lies to bring her
[1:28:13] back to this original truth what is this
[1:28:16] original truth I in you and you in me we
[1:28:20] are coming to a union a marriage bride
[1:28:25] remember when he says bride age bride
[1:28:28] age the term bride has to do with
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:33] relationship it's a
[1:28:36] title that
[1:28:38] changes the noting who this person
[1:28:42] is not
[1:28:45] woman not just Assembly
[1:28:49] Church but
[1:28:51] now bride
[1:28:54] amen which means this is the one that
[1:28:56] I'm uniting
[1:28:58] with I in you you in me brother said
[1:29:03] that makes them all
[1:29:09] one the message when their eyes were
[1:29:11] open they knew him 1964 he says remember
[1:29:14] in Malachi 4 not Malachi 3 now Malachi 4
[1:29:18] God promised to send the anointing
[1:29:21] again what did the opening of the word
[1:29:22] bring an anointing
[1:29:25] amen promise to send the anointing again
[1:29:28] restore the faith of the children back
[1:29:30] to the fathers again and it's exactly
[1:29:32] what God promised Joel
[1:29:35] amen praise God I want to read just two
[1:29:39] more things for you in the Rapture we're
[1:29:42] back in the Rapture message the first
[1:29:44] thing comes forth is his message calling
[1:29:46] the bride together the next thing is a
[1:29:49] resurrection of the sleeping bride the
[1:29:50] ones that died back in the other ages
[1:29:52] they're caught up together and the the
[1:29:54] trumpet the feast in the heavens and the
[1:29:55] sky why that's the thing that takes
[1:29:57] place friends we're right there ready
[1:30:00] now the only thing the church coming out
[1:30:03] has got to lay before the sun to
[1:30:05] ripen we've already been separated we've
[1:30:08] already been gathered the call has gone
[1:30:10] forth the bride is being separated the
[1:30:13] shuck is pulling back what is it we're
[1:30:15] doing now
[1:30:17] maturing ripening cuz this
[1:30:20] Revelation was to bring us back

[1:30:27] peace that was smitten off being
[1:30:29] restored back to Christ amen the brid
[1:30:32] tree restored the fellowship coming back
[1:30:35] the relationship coming

[1:30:39] first seal he says I'll no longer call
[1:30:41] you church but I'll call you bride so
[1:30:45] that you'll understand
[1:30:47] it prise God what is the bride
[1:30:51] age it's a calling out amen it's a
[1:30:54] restoring

[1:30:58] original Pentecostal
[1:31:00] fathers I've used that term so many
[1:31:03] times it lost meaning for me but by the
[1:31:06] grace of God when we stop and just ask
[1:31:08] God what does it mean what is the faith
[1:31:10] of the fathers oh it's that Faith they
[1:31:13] had when they come spilling out that
[1:31:14] upper room that they had just received
[1:31:16] the promise they were part of it it was
[1:31:20] alive inside of
[1:31:21] them what is the original faith of to
[1:31:24] the fathers I am part of this Revelation
[1:31:27] it's in me I want to spill out of church
[1:31:30] and spill out of my study and spill out
[1:31:32] of everything and I want to go tell the

[1:32:07] message not a different message the same
[1:32:09] message what was the message she picked
[1:32:11] up come out from among her my people and
[1:32:13] be ye separate thus sayeth the Lord and

[1:32:29] faith of the Pentecostal
[1:32:33] fathers amen amen in the day we live
[1:32:37] in there's so many people that are
[1:32:40] sitting like those disciples were
[1:32:41] sitting in the upper
[1:32:43] room we know he came we know he died we
[1:32:48] know he
[1:32:51] resurrected we know it was true
[1:32:54] we saw all the
[1:32:59] signs but they were still sitting
[1:33:01] there wondering sitting there afraid
[1:33:05] sitting there uncertain and
[1:33:08] insecure so many people in the world are
[1:33:10] in the same position we know the word is
[1:33:12] true we know the Bible is true we saw
[1:33:14] all the things that happen in the
[1:33:16] prophet's Ministry we know he's got to
[1:33:18] be a man of God and that's wonderful
[1:33:20] friends but don't just sit there say God

[1:33:24] Pentecost I need I need you I need you
[1:33:27] and me and me and you I need to know
[1:33:29] that I'm part of it that it's inside of

[1:33:48] of the Pentecostal fathers that's where
[1:33:51] their heart was their Revelation their
[1:33:53] understanding that's what gave them the
[1:33:55] boldness and the courage to die for what
[1:33:57] they
[1:33:58] believe to give their life to Proclaim
[1:34:02] it I said God I need yes the same thing
[1:34:07] that you gave them amen but praise God
[1:34:10] we know it's here not in measure anymore
[1:34:12] because brother BM said it was a dip in
[1:34:14] Luther and a dip in Wesley it was
[1:34:15] portioned out but there's not portioned
[1:34:17] down anymore because the Holy Ghost has
[1:34:19] made a full return the Full Life of
[1:34:21] Christ came with the fullness of the
[1:34:23] word and everything that was poured out
[1:34:25] in them is being poured out now in his

[1:34:49] Pentecostal fa amen God bless you as you
[1:34:52] stand praise God stand to our feet and
[1:34:55] say oh God I'm so thankful Lord I'm not
[1:34:58] living in the day of portion I'm not so
[1:35:00] I'm so thankful you given me eyes to see
[1:35:02] you fulfilled your word you fulfilled
[1:35:04] the promise and you've let me see it you
[1:35:07] put something in me to believe it and
[1:35:09] what does that do for me you say well of
[1:35:11] course I believe it of course I see it I
[1:35:12] know I can see what those Thunders are
[1:35:14] do you know how rare that is do you know
[1:35:17] how unusual it is for you to actually
[1:35:19] have the ability to see it and believe
[1:35:21] it and have no resistance inside of you
[1:35:23] and say I that's nothing but the truth
[1:35:25] you know what that means this Revelation
[1:35:28] is given only to his beloved
[1:35:31] bride what's he trying to do he's trying
[1:35:33] to call you by the revelation of the
[1:35:35] word and say it's me it's me and you're
[1:35:39] part of me and you belong to me won't
[1:35:42] you come out and Unite with
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:47] Meen oh you don't understand sometimes
[1:35:50] we don't understand what a precious
[1:35:52] thing Revelation is the revelation of
[1:35:54] the word is the Vindication it's the
[1:35:57] it's the identification because this is
[1:35:59] revealed only to his beloved
[1:36:03] bride say oh God thank you for restoring
[1:36:08] me back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[1:36:11] what did it Malachi 4 how did Malachi 4
[1:36:14] do it those mysterious truth why why is
[1:36:17] it so important listen I'm sorry I'm
[1:36:19] going over time but to me I just want to
[1:36:21] lay this in why is it so important that
[1:36:23] those Thunders were were were revealed
[1:36:25] that the seals were open why because
[1:36:28] listen it brother B said it was the
[1:36:29] unwritten part of the scriptures
[1:36:32] amen John was told not to write it
[1:36:35] nothing he said nothing wrote about it
[1:36:36] opening of the seven seal silence why is
[1:36:38] that so important amen it's not so we
[1:36:41] can get a whole bunch of information
[1:36:42] under the seals that information is
[1:36:44] critical and important and will help
[1:36:45] your
[1:36:46] life but this is just to
[1:36:49] me what it means is no human being ever
[1:36:54] could put an interpretation to that cuz
[1:36:56] there was nothing
[1:36:59] written nobody could guess nobody could
[1:37:03] come up with any idea even brother
[1:37:05] Brenham said I've read all these books
[1:37:06] and nobody even knows that there's Seven
[1:37:07] Seals to be open they don't even know
[1:37:10] that the Thunders are to be revealed in
[1:37:12] the end time what does that mean that
[1:37:14] means if this is the revealing of those
[1:37:17] seven Thunders then that is Jesus Christ
[1:37:20] himself calling to his bride and he's
[1:37:22] proving it by re revealing the unwritten
[1:37:24] portion of the word that was sealed to
[1:37:26] the end time showing that he's here the
[1:37:29] king is here with the book in his head
[1:37:31] calling for his Queen to come stand by
[1:37:33] his side and if you're hearing the call
[1:37:35] who does that make
[1:37:37] you and what is your potential and what
[1:37:40] is he calling you to do come stand by my
[1:37:42] side hallelujah amen then what does it
[1:37:45] mean to come stand by his
[1:37:48] side oh I love questions amen I love to
[1:37:52] question myself what is does it mean to
[1:37:53] come stand by his side to me to me it
[1:37:57] means to come and align myself with his
[1:37:59] word and his thinking in this message to
[1:38:02] come shoulder toosh shoulder with him
[1:38:04] and come in alignment and agreement and
[1:38:06] harmony with this revelation of this
[1:38:08] word for this end
[1:38:10] time he's come the King has come with a
[1:38:12] book in his hand and he's calling for
[1:38:14] his Queen to come stand by his side
[1:38:18] hallelujah amen say God that's the
[1:38:21] greatest desire of my heart I hear you
[1:38:24] calling I can hear the call I hear it I
[1:38:28] see it I feel it I sense it it's all
[1:38:30] over me God give me the courage to climb
[1:38:33] to that platform and Stand By Your Side
[1:38:36] to surrender my will will to yield
[1:38:38] myself completely to give up all of my
[1:38:41] thinking and my tradition help me to
[1:38:43] come and Stand By Your Side to stand in
[1:38:48] alignment in harmony with the fullness
[1:38:52] of the word
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:55] that's the privilege we have in this
[1:38:57] day and that's the message he's using to
[1:39:00] bring us back to the faith of the
[1:39:02] Pentecostal
[1:39:04] fathers praise
[1:39:06] God I count myself the luckiest human
[1:39:09] being to be on the face of the Earth and
[1:39:12] that word lucky may we know it's Divine
[1:39:14] Providence but I feel lucky
[1:39:16] anyhow I know it's not luck but that's
[1:39:19] the feeling that's all over me I'm the
[1:39:21] Most Blessed the most privileged and I'm
[1:39:23] the I'm so thankful I'm just so sorry
[1:39:25] that I haven't been thankful enough and
[1:39:27] given my life enough for what he's given
[1:39:29] to
[1:39:31] me oh praise God let's bow our heads
[1:39:36] together oh Heavenly Father we thank
[1:39:40] you God how you come up with such a
[1:39:44] beautiful
[1:39:45] plan how you've come in this end time
[1:39:48] and you've taken a human being and your
[1:39:51] prophet and you revealed the mystery
[1:39:54] that was in your
[1:39:56] mind and God we don't hear it as facts
[1:40:00] and figures and dates and times we hear
[1:40:04] it as you calling us to come Stand By
[1:40:06] Your
[1:40:08] Side God help us to heed the
[1:40:11] call to come and align ourselves with
