[0:00] you were the tiny little baby when she
[0:03] when she was hanging her clothes out on
[0:05] the backyard and all at once the house
[0:07] caught fire and here comes the fire anes
[0:10] to put it out and the house was full of
[0:11] flames you were screaming from the
[0:14] upstairs no one would go in and pierc
[0:17] those Flames but a little mother your
[0:19] little mother wrapped herself up and in
[0:22] there she ran through those flames and
[0:24] she grabbed you she took off she took
[0:26] the clothes from off of her face and
[0:28] wrapped you all up in in it and put you
[0:31] in her arms and and and placed her face
[0:34] to the flames and Through the flames she
[0:37] came to rescue you that's why you're
[0:39] pretty today and that's why she so
[0:42] scarred you are ashamed of those scars
[0:46] that's the way Jesus has done for us
[0:48] when we were Sinners ugly before God
[0:51] cast down and turn away he came and that
[0:53] the lovely Son of God from his Ivory
[0:56] Place palaces he came down to earth and
[0:58] he took upon the shame and the
[1:00] humiliation upon himself and the sin
[1:03] upon himself and he died there on
[1:04] Calvary crying out should I be ashamed
[1:07] of a gospel Christians on the street are
[1:10] ashamed to stand for the gospel but he
[1:12] was marred and he was made ugly so that
[1:15] I could be made
[1:19] free and so in considering
[1:22] that uh you know I'm so glad those those
[1:27] scars were a testament of a mother's
[1:30] love for a baby she was willing to
[1:32] endure the scars for somebody else's
[1:34] sake and when we consider Jesus Christ
[1:37] he was willing to endure the rejections
[1:39] rure the pain endure the embarrassment
[1:42] the humiliation for somebody else's sake
[1:45] now I think the question is coming to
[1:47] all of us what are we willing to endure
[1:49] are you willing to endure the rejection
[1:51] you willing to endure the criticism are
[1:53] you willing to endure all of these pains
[1:55] that you're going to have to handle for
[1:58] somebody else's sake
[2:02] if we're living our life for ourselves
[2:04] we haven't
[2:05] arrived if we're living our life for
[2:07] somebody else we're looking Heaven
[2:09] heavenward we're pointed the right
[2:11] direction and that's the reality of it
[2:14] in Hebrews 12 it
[2:16] says um looking unto Jesus the author
[2:19] and the finisher of our faith who for
[2:20] the joy that was set before him endured
[2:23] the
[2:24] cross there's a time where you just have
[2:26] to endure the pain you just have to go
[2:29] through it it's painful when they ripped
[2:31] open that scar tissue it's painful but
[2:34] it had to be ripped open to set me right
[2:37] so I could walk right act right
[2:40] scripturally or spiritually speaking
[2:42] there's wounds in me had to be ripped
[2:44] apart I had to have some spots that I've
[2:46] been covering over ripped to
[2:50] shreds so that I could start walking
[2:52] right talking right acting right
[2:55] treating people right it's not fun it's
[2:58] painful amen maturing is painful
