that we can see you Lord as you are in this age you Lord in the eye Salve will be in anointing our eyes so that we can see Lord that the spiritual blindness will be cured by the word knowing that our spiritual Amnesia will be removed by the word God that will see you in our midst Lord unveiling yourself God I pray you'd have your way Lord as we listen to this message God I pray you'd give us a spirit of Revelation your spirit of Revelation that we can see you unveiling yourself scripture by scripture word by word that we can see ourselves identified with you we love you we ask your blessings over all we say and do this evening and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you we're going to let you have your seats for just a minute thank you musicians we appreciate your help once again we're going to do our winner tape service and this is something that I've grown to look forward to every year we've done it now for four or five years in a row I can't remember if this is our fourth or if this is our fifth and like I said on Sunday I always think oh I enjoy that so much we'll do another one and the year goes by so fast we never get a chance but I'm so thankful that we've we've done this and I'm I get excited about it I look forward to it it's amazing how it's there's always such an atmosphere when we listen to the message together and I I really like that and I just wanted to pull up a PowerPoint real quick and go over a few things and then we'll get into opening scripture and get into the questions as we normally do that but to um to to remind everybody of the the reason we started doing this initially several years ago uh when I started doing this I just had an inspiration and a desire to do this together as a congregation and one is because I really wanted to demonstrate to the younger ones those who are are getting interested in serving the lord and wanting to know the message for themselves when they get to that age of accountability and Beyond into the teenage years and they really start to feed on the word for themselves I just wanted to demonstrate to them through this how we glean from the word of God and how we take from the messages and actually grow in Revelation and understanding that we don't just play tapes as background noise it's not just something that plays off in the corner while we do something but this is something that God has given to us as a spiritual diet to grow us into the image he had of us before the foundation of the world so this is spiritual food and and so that's one of the reasons we wanted to do that but we enjoyed it all so much as a current education we just keep doing it so those of you who are coming into that age of accountability and Beyond amen this is a great opportunity just to see you know how we listen to the message to grow how we listen to the message to feed not just listening like we listen to any other program this isn't a program this isn't a radio broadcast amen this is the word of God that he's given us to us in this day and so be pay special attention I've got a few things I want to show you there's always those that are are new that maybe weren't here last year are always those that the younger ones like I said are coming up and becoming more interested in these things for themselves so I just want to go over real quick where The Book Rack is we've got the book rack out in the foyer as you head out the doors you can see it there there's 12 slots in there and we keep the the top section is a constant order of six books that never changes we don't rotate those titles out they stay the same and there's a reason behind that and when we first put the rack up I if you'll remember I asked the entire congregation everybody to read each of these books in this order in sequential order the order they are from left to right and I felt like that was really important for us all to be on the same page and we found out it was very beneficial these are those titles the spoken word is the Original Seed present stage of my Ministry is this the sign of the answer you'll see those are in 62 then coming into 1963 the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals the seventh seal in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the reason we do that is because you can actually take those messages from 62 into 63 into the seals and you can follow the transition of brother Med in Ministry and catch the huge transition that's taking place amen and and it becomes very apparent and very obvious as you pull those selections out and it puts us all in the same frame of mind where we understand that now he's moving into the the seventh angel Ministry he's moving in to his commission Amen to reveal those Seven Seals those those mysterious Thunders amen and so it's a wonderful thing so we leave that there everybody you young people if you haven't done it I encourage you to take those six messages and read them in order so if you've never done it for yourself I encourage you to do that it'll really be a blessing to you and do it prayerfully and ask God for the spirit of Revelation to see what the prophet is trying to get us to see excuse me then this bottom section these six titles are constantly changing amen and every year when I do this I order six new books to go in there and so we've done the same thing this year we've got six new titles one of them is the one that we're doing tonight uh the title The Message there is a man here that can turn on the light so that'll be one of them but for the new books for this year are the one we're doing tonight there's a man here that can turn on the light who is this Melchizedek the identification of Christ in all ages modern events made clear by prophecy the seed is not air with the shuck and souls that are in prison now so these are six new titles that we haven't had in the library so when we started this we started with 12 books because we wanted the rack to be full and then they put the Overflow of those books in the library so year by year we've gotten more and I think last count we had I think we have something like 46 or 48 titles in the library now with these new additions which means if you're here that you can easily have your own personal library of message books of 46 or 48 books and so I know everything's digital now and we have it on our phones and chips and all of that but there is something to be said for having a book and maybe I'm just starting to age I don't know but I I still like to have a book and you know I love to go into my children's rooms I love to go into their bedroom and see on their look on their shelf their own Library that's theirs they've read those books they've put marks in those books those are their books and I love that and and I think it's a valuable to take the time to go through the book and glean from it and you don't have to do it I mean there's no there's nothing that says it's not as effective an electronic form as paper form I believe the word's effective in whatever form that's not the point but I just it's it's it's nice to have to jot things down to highlight to go back over those things again it's nice to have your own books so just just one thing I'd like to ask you if you haven't had your own Library yet and you haven't got these books uh a young person or somebody that's in new I'd encourage you just to take one or two book at a time don't go in there and get 46. don't go in the Shelf with a basket and just get one of each because the problem is you won't read them all but if you get one or two at a time and don't get any more till you read this one or two then every book on your library is not just a book that you have as a book that you've read that's really important it's not important to have these books it's important to read these books and pray that God will reveal these books to us the contents and then the message so I encourage you just get one or two at a time and after you've read that get one or two more and before you know it after a year or two you will have your own library of books that you've read that you've put marks in that God has fed you from that you've grown and that your Revelation has grown and if you as young people coming up into that age of accountability or just before that or just beyond that if you'll do that I tell you you'll grow spiritually you'll be surprised at where you are after a couple of years so it's like anything else things we we want things to happen fast we want things changes in our life immediate we want fairy dust you know where something sprinkles down everything changed but there's changes that are happening in our life all the time and spiritual maturity that's coming and it's just like growing somebody says oh how did you get so tall you know you went you went from Tiny to tall in a year and everybody asked you oh you're growing how did you get so tall and you have no idea how you got tall you just ate and it happened well the same thing will happen spiritually if you keep eating you'll keep growing and people will notice that you're maturing spiritually and they say wow how did that happen I don't know how it happened it happened by feeding on the word and God changing me so I encourage you to do that if you haven't started developing your own library and reading these books I encourage you to do so or any books it doesn't have to be these you can read whatever on the tablet on your tablet or on your phone but I encourage you to just keep that steady diet of the message so in the library you can see here this is a picture of the library this is where all the books are you can go in there's no charge for anything in the library you're welcome to have it everything in the library comes out of the general fund so if you want to contribute to it just drop an offering in the Box in the journal fund and that's what covers it so you're welcome to have it you're also welcome to take books to share with other individuals it's not just for the individuals in this assembly but they're also for outreach if you have somebody you know would benefit from it give them a book they're not here to sit on our shelves to look pretty they're here to be fed upon Amen to be read to be used amen so Avail yourselves to that resource also we've got a new shelf we put up and the titles we got this year we've grown into that new shelf so hopefully over the next couple years we'll start to fill this shelf up too and have even more books available so that's where they are in the library okay for tonight we're going to go through the message there is a man here that can turn on the light from 1963. we have the books here this is what the book looks like if you haven't picked up a book yet there's a whole rack of them out here in the foyer of the church over there by the door we got I don't know 150 or 200 of them there's plenty for everybody so if you Devin got one you can slip out now and grab one so that you have your own book we're going to start at the beginning of this message but I want to go through the questions one thing that we've done if you haven't been here in the past when we've done that is I like to ask a few questions and have the congregation jot down those questions because as we read the brother Branham is going to answer those questions so the whole point is not just to read but to read to learn to read to grow to read to understand so so every time I pick up a book or I start a message whether it's electronic form or in paper one of the first things I do is I see when he preached this so brother Brandon preached this message right at the end of 1963 and we know 1963 is a pitiful pivotal year because of the opening of the seals right at the end of 1963 December 29th 1229 December 29th in the morning service that's what the m means in the morning service then I always look at the title and and I don't take the title lightly so there is a man here that can turn on the light oh when I read that I feel like preaching because brother random is titling this there is a man here that can turn on the light so if you've read this message or you know the message you know that is a super exciting title and I want to hold this title in my mind the whole time I'm listening to the message because what brother Branham is trying to share demonstrate teach has something to do with what he's titled it so I try to remind myself of this title throughout the duration of the sermon and that way I stay on track with what the prophet's trying to get me to see amen so there is a man here that can turn on the light so that's what he wants us to be aware of or to see that there is a man here present tense that can turn on the light I'll let you figure out who that man is all right let's open up the first cover to the first page you have the title page flip it over one time into the back side of the title page I go through this for the youngsters in our mix who may never have gone through the formatting of This Book of these books but these are the books from voice of God Recordings if you go to the back side of the title page it goes the title again it gives the date 63-1229 M and then has this statement this message by Brother William Miriam Branham was delivered on Sunday morning December 29 1963 at Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana USA I always look to see where brother Venom preaches the message because there's many times that brother Brown will be addressing something or phrasing something for the crowd that he's preaching to and and sometimes you'll say you know he doesn't say it like that in other places but he's using terms that the people can understand so if he's amongst Pentecostals if he's amongst an interdenominational sometimes he'll phrase things different or use phrases that they'll understand so so I like to see where he preached it so I want to know what who he's preaching to whether he'll be free or whether he'll be careful amen and things like that then it says this sermon number 63-1229 m is two hours and 29 minutes so I always look at all of that I know how long the message is I know where he preached I know when he preached it and I know the sequence of events because we know the message and I know the title so I begin to hold that title In My Mind so now let's go through the questions I'm going to ask five questions if you want to jot them down I'm going to put them on the overhead so you can write them down so the five questions are questions that brother Branham will answer throughout the message this message that we're listening to first question what is the subject that brother Branham is going to speak on so we know the title but he's going to tell us what his subject is what is the subject that brother Branham is going to speak on what is the subject that brother Branham is going to speak on and and I don't pull any tricks there's nothing tricky about the questions they're in sequential order he'll answer them in sequential orders we follow through the point is not to not to have an exam the point is for us to constantly be watching what's being said and gaining understanding by what he's saying is to be a careful listener that's the reason we do the questions to be a careful listener also it's a way for me to highlight things that are in the message that I believe to be important so what is the subject that brother Branham is going to speak on number two why is Christ a fugitive to his own church you can see each one of these questions could be a sermon there's so much to these why is Christ a fugitive to his own church also in asking the questions you can we can answer these questions all kinds of ways and be right but the point is how does he answer this question in this message as we're going through because he always gives us specific detail why is Christ a fugitive to his own church question number three how does light come how does light come and number four what does God do when he gets ready to use anything what does God do when he gets ready to use anything and there's five questions this evening question number five comes by what life comes by what now we're going to begin reading uh from paragraph one on the on the first page and I wanted to start brother Ben does some greetings he he says some things to his congregation there's a few minutes sometimes if this goes on for a long time we have quite a lengthy message sometimes we'll advance past that and get started more into when he starts with the scripture but tonight I just wanted to play it because it's only a few minutes and I love some of the the I would say the introduction part of brother Brenner's messages because you really get to see the character of the Prophet as he's speaking to his congregation talking about events that happened or people or or here he's talking about a member of the congregation that passed away and and I think it's very vital and very important um because once you see the nature of the man that God used and how that nature was developed you begin to see how gentle he is and how carrying he is and how he handles situations there's there's more to the message than just doctrinal teaching there's a lot more God even chose the vessel that he would use to present the message and that vessel had a certain character and certain characteristics and I think that's one of the most valuable things that we have in the recorded sermons is that we don't just get the highlights of Doctrine but we get the life that's on display from the prophet of the age and he's demonstrating Christ amen he's demonstrating Christ and bride form Christ and a son of God a redeemed Son of God and and he's been molded through the word and molded by the word and by the spirit of God and and it's now uh to me understanding if I could if I if I could put into words what's in my heart understanding and watching that nature is a safeguard against false Ministry because you can get doctrinal things in teaching and and things like that but if the doctrine and the teaching don't produce the life then what's the point of the doctrine in the teaching because we want we want the word amen to motives into the image of that word and that word is Christ and it should be it should make me like Christ and so if the vessel amen that that is bringing that teaching has not been molded or in the process of being molded so yeah I say this is a very dangerous because I'm in the process of being molded I hope I don't look at me I've not come to Perfection so don't judge everything by my lack of perfection but that word should be changing us it should be molding us into christ-like character that was on display so so you shouldn't see such a contradiction between the the the life and the doctrine they should come together like they did in the prophet and of course we're all on the journey and we're all growing and none of us have come to Perfection and we have to be patient with one another but I believe this is my personal feeling in my opinion but but to me it's been a safeguard against false because you see sometimes the false Doctrine will come with a certain personality slant or a harshness or a criticalness that just wasn't in the prophet it'll come with lack of love and it will come with or with with whatever but but to me that I'm not interested in that what I'm interested in is whatever it it takes to get this word to manifest inside of me to to become alive in me not in my mind but in my daily life I want to be changed by the word and so I think it's important to see the character of the of the prophet of God that his nature the nature that the word comes through and and I believe I I believe it's valuable because you can have things so right and come so hard and so cutting and so and you can deliver the right word with the wrong spirit and do a lot of damage and and I don't want any of us to fall subject to that I want the right word with the right spirit amen that's our desire that's our goal so I think it's important so it's just a few minutes and I wanted to hear some of them so we will begin on page one uh paragraph one and we will go to page we will stop on page 14 at the bottom of paragraph 80. so it'll be right at 40 minutes just under 40 minutes tonight and then I will get up at the end and we'll go through our questions again before we do this I'd like to stand and read the opening scriptures together because once you get your book out and go through your notes it's hard to open your Bible so let's let's all stand and open our Bibles to the book of Isaiah and brother bear is going to open with two scripture readings it's wrote out in the message book so we can follow it but I want to read it from our own Bibles right now so Isaiah 42 verse 1. Isaiah 42 and verse 1. behold my servant whom I have uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth I have put I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised Reed shall he not break in the smoking Flack shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he has set judgment in the earth and the Isle shall wait for his law thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spreadeth forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon him and spirit to them that walk therein I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and and from and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house now let's turn to Matthew chapter 4. Matthew chapter 4 and we'll begin reading from verse 12. Matthew 4 and 12. now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed unto Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast and the borders of Zebulon and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah's the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of Nephilim by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up from the time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand amen God bless you as you have your seats Amen brother Franco you'll go ahead and start the tape for us our heavenly father we thank thee this morning for thy goodness and mercy for giving us the privilege of ascending here together again a day this side of the great eternity to worship the lovely one the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you because that he come to the Earth to redeem us from a life of sin and to give us this great heritage that we have through his righteousness as we this morning are here as his ambassadors to to break the spread of life to this waiting congregation May the Holy Spirit Inspire every word and place it into the hearts of the people just as we have been we ask this in Jesus name amen amen be seated certainly redeem this a great privilege again this morning to be standing here with you sorry that we don't have no more room than what we do to take care of the people our Tabernacle isn't quite large enough and we are very grateful to be here through this holidays from from down at our home at Tucson and the weather was kind of rough but we was happy to be here and I have the meaning now I want to announce that tonight there will be a healing service not our prayer for the sake and uh I told Billy just now he said well what will you do I said well maybe you better give out some cards tonight about 6 30. uh assaulted where the people won't I see it's so jammed in here we know just how to bring them one by one so you'd be called by the number of your card and uh so there won't be any congestion we can just call them one by one and let them go through the line as we pray for them so you if you're sick or have loved ones or sick and won't bring them in come about uh 6 30 something like that seven o'clock and get a prayer card you'll be at the door or however he gives them out as you come in and then this will probably be about the last time I get to be back for some time calls got a very heavy schedule now down you're still in the United States until this spring late so we're we'll um maybe get back again a little later on this summer if the Lord willing I'd like to if we get the the place over here if it's air conditioned I was going to ask Philly I would like to speak on those seven trumpets have a certain a meeting here for the seven trumpets if if the Lord willing or that the seven churches the Seven Seals and now the seven trumpets and can get some time like in June where people's Hazard vacation give them time so they could get in and um I'm glad to see brother Shepard here this morning uh from the hospital is out scene the other day and sister Shepard I did get to call you yesterday that dream that you sent me was very very fine you've seen as it was Christ in a on a in the skies upon this White Horse but yet being bound you see but yet before it faded away all your family got to see it that dream interpretation is that your family has seen his move of this last days before it was very spiritual and a very good blessing to you your family that family come up out of some Great Tribulation to come to where they are today now we have something a little on the sad side this morning since I met here one of our precious friends and comers to this Tabernacle the coats family which uh we all love them they come down from the East and are from Chicago around and a sister big billy havoc and and her sister Armstrong and all the girls they I think they were formerly Nazarene and it's come to the Lord and they're very precious friends of ours and the brother and sister quotes their father and mother was on the road home the other day from over in the west and someone slid on the road and and kill sister coats instantly and and while they call me over and and Tucson and I heard about it I was sitting right there then with a box of candy she had just made for me sitting on it on the table and you don't know how it made me feel but I I think that thank the Lord this morning she didn't have to suffer she was getting aged and she didn't have to suffer and she went home to be with God just thinking and talking to her two girls just not a room in there brother quotes this year this morning he got some broken ribs and I called him in the hospital and or he was hospitalized over in Missouri and his ribs broke and things but he certainly had a real courage a real Christian law knowing that his little Queen is not dead she's alive for every morning and there will be a uniting time job said one time all that thou would hide me in the grave and keep me in a secret place until thou wrath be passed you ever notice God and nature does the same thing like the sap that's in the trees up here holding on the leaves and four winter time comes the Wrath that's poured out upon the Earth see one time the Earth didn't have winter and in the Millennium there'll never be any more winners yeah so it's a wrath upon the Earth then when that happened see before the Wrath comes God in his Mercy sends that sap right down into the underneath the ground into the roots of that tree it keeps it there until the Wrath of the winter be passed then raises it back up again in the springtime all that thou would hide me in the grave and keep me in the secret place until thy wrath be passed amen that's what he's done for our sister that's what he does for all Christians brother quotes God bless you I'm so happy to know that that the Seal of god holds into our trouble amen I know what he going through with because I went through with something similar years ago but I'm one by one we have to cross over this Great River and uh and it'll be my time one of these days in your time one of these days but as David said I'll fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they come from me now in commemoration of sister coach our precious sister who's gone on to God is a little commemoration to her this morning I want the congregation to stand

from here to Phoenix and to California and right back to Dallas and and perhaps drop down into San Antonio I think it is back over in Alabama and Florida and through there so we'll be seeing you people down in there the Lord willing right away and then you keep praying for us and we'll let you know when the Lord puts upon our heart now to hold a few days here uh this coming summer I had a group of meetings scheduled and many of you in New York know when the vision come to say that those meetings in the Scandinavian country you remember them schedule in there then while I was in New York the vision came that every one of those meetings were canceled for some reason and I remember I told some of you here when I was in New York that's just exactly what happened because they all on the same day and couldn't get that building so that that might leave a little spot there in June it might be in the will of the Lord I was thinking maybe to come back for those trumpets right here before it's too late see so we know that everything works just right so that was all my heart so it might be what he wants us to do now uh see you're changing seats with each other and out in the halls and so forth we wish we just had a place to sit down and now when we have those trumpet sets we want to get the high school gymnasium yeah I think he sees 5500 and then we'd have a chance to everybody to have a seat and sound and listen quietly while we're while we're preaching or the trumpets they're very very fine uh looking at the other day see it on the Sixth Seal all seven trumpet sounds right there on that Sixth Seal thing just before the seventh seal opens the coming of Christ and tonight I have a very important message that I want to speak just before the the the healing service and if you're here and are going to stay over while we're trying if impossible to start just a little bit early because it'll be a prayer line it won't preach too long but there's something that I wanted to say to the church for some time and kind of post you on the the the how things are running at this time and just where we're standing and the best of my knowledge through the scripture now I want you to turn this morning with me if you want to mark down or keep record of where we are reading from the book of Isaiah and I wish to read from Isaiah the 42nd chapter of Isaiah we are very happy this morning also to have brother Dao sitting with us here while you're turning the only thought he wasn't going to live here in Shreveport the other day and he certainly got faith the investor is climbs right out of it the Lord blesses him out and see brother dial is 91 years old and had a complete heart failure and heart attack on top of it and the Very doctor said that he didn't see there's any way for him to live brother Dao is living in the doctor's Dead Brother down and then a man 91 years old with heart failure and heart attack and then everyone was going up there I saw him come walking down the street I saw him in the church and I went and told him under an oxygen tent in the name of the Lord I shake your hand and I'll see you in church again and shake your hand on the street the very next service here he was sitting right back here in the church and I went over Louisville where we eat at the Blue Boar over there to eat and just as I got out of my car startup Street here come brother now walking down the street there it was just perfectly and how the Lord has blessed him now we're going to talk on healing tonight and things that got some real outstanding things to tell you for tonight but now it's all that I can get the tapes down and get ready to turn them on I want to start reading from Isaiah the 42nd chapter and the first and the seventh first and Matthew the fourth chapter beginning I believe 15 it's the 16th verse now in in the 42nd chapter of of Isaiah we're going to three behold my servant whom I uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighted I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry or lift up or cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruise read shall he not break and a smoking flag shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment under truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he has have set judgment in the earth and the island shall wait for his laws thus saith the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and the spirit to them that walk therein I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and I will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people or a light of the Gentiles to open the blinded eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that set in darkness out of the prison house now in the Matthews gospel the fourth chapter I wish to read the Fulfillment of that prophecy given by Isaiah in the fourth chapter of Matthew um I will begin to read if possible let's begin at the 12th verses to the 15th now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast and the borders of zabalin and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which is spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying behold the land of zebra and the land of nephil by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee all the Gentiles the people sat in darkness Saul great light and to them that set in the regions of the Shadows of death light is sprung up and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word and now odd little text that I heard someone speaking said this but I want to take this for a text there is a man here that can turn on the light and now we're going to speak on the subject of light this follows the three subjects that we have just been speaking on one of them in Tucson or Phoenix on why Jesus came by the way of Bethlehem that he must be because he is Bethlehem Bethlehem b-e-t-h's house e-l God e-h-a-m is Brad Bread House of God's bread and each Christian that's born in Christ is born in Bethlehem amen God's house of bread and then in their typing of David which was a fugitive at the time of his uh excommunicating from his people he was turned out and Bethlehem was besieged and the Philistines was garrisoned around Bethlehem and David a fugitive a type of the church today of Christ see Christ is a fugitive to his own church today they have a fugitive is something that's refused and David had been refused yet he was anointed to be king but the prophet had anointed him and during this time being a fugitive from his people he had picked up many Gallant Gentiles one of them killed 800 man one day with a spear or sword and another one jumped into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day and and this Gathering little which is beans or peas or something and and all of them run away and he stood and killed mantle his arm got tired they also kill those giant Brothers of Goliath Gallop man holding to David because they knowed he was coming in power they know no matter what anyone said God had the anointing on David and they noted they were Gentiles no matter how much they turned him out they yet knew that he was coming to power amen and one day there what a type it is today of Christ a fugitive if you say Christ The Fugitive according to the Bible that we God is Godly taking us through those seven churches this lady of Sean Church Christ was a fugitive outside of his church rejected trying to get back in it amen he's a fugitive to his own church and the reason he is The Fugitive is because he is the word and they won't let the word in it except the Creeds instead we find out then that in this great struggle those got men around around David gentiles if you notice how Bethlehem is far going to get on that subject but how Bethany ham actually Rahab the Harlot her son was the one who founded Bethlehem it's a wheat Center and a lot of fine water there and he founded the little city and it was the smallest of all the cities because the prophet said out Bethlehem of Judea aren't thou the least amongst all the princes or the cities of Jerusalem or Judea but out of these shall come the governor yeah that'll be my people out of the little one David when he was selected up there the Greek Fine Brothers when the prophet Samuel went up to anoint all of us standing there great Gallup man looked like a big look at fine looking Kings but the very rejected one was the one David that had the aura poured right up on him the rejected city was the one that Christ it's a rejected that Christ picks up see the ones that's rejected then we find after he come over and after he come Boaz and there come another Gentile in which he come in by Ruth and out of there come just now just come David and a little Hillside stable out there brought forth the King of Kings Jesus Christ the son of David his spiritual son now then he was David himself being born in the city he had to come to this little spot and it was called Bethlehem which means the the house of God's bread and he is the house of God's bread David laying there on the hill that day and he looked down seen the Philistines garrisoned around like that it must have got hot and thirsty he said oh if I could just have a drink from that well once more while the least of his thoughts was a command to his them who loved him so is it today the least of Jesus thoughts or how about his word should be a commander we Gentiles who love him or we know he's coming into Power amen no matter how much he's rejecting Heaven's Earth will pass away but this will still Reign just the same or all heavens and earth is gone and we know he's coming into Power calls nothing will keep it from happening this is Christ the revelation of him and this is going to happen just the way the word says it is because he is the word and the least of his commands are no matter how little it is if it's be re-baptized or whatever it is we'll do it anyhow amen this is command and the least of David's thought was a command to those Gentiles or are they a type of the Gentile church today Gallant man see those men who stood by David were Gentiles but Gallant man they were Fearless they didn't know what fear was one man took a sword killed 800 man I'm all around him what a man that was one of them one other man is an Egyptian Warrior Run up with a long spear he only had a stick in his hand he took the stick and knocked the spirit's hand took Spear and killed him himself one of those giants had 14 inch fingers like that a 14 inches your fingers as long as your hand closed open that up that would be 28 inch hand and with a spear and jumped right in there and killed him see why he was a Gallup man a gentile looking up on anointed one that he know was coming into Power did you notice them being so Gallant to David when David finally come in power he made them ruler over cities then Jesus promise the same thing make him ruler then in there when David's desire was to have a fresh drink he probably had some old warm stagnated water up there he's drinking but he happened to think of that fresh water down there at Bethlehem the house of God's bread and he said if I only had a drink from that well and those men pull their sword and fought 15 miles of Philistines not because he asked him to but because they know he wanted it and they cut them Palestines all the way to the well while two of them fought the other and got a his bucket of water and fought their way back all the way back and handed to David talk about gallon David a godly man said God forbid that I would drink it from these friends and put their life in jeopardy and he made a drink offer poured it out up on the ground to the Lord give it to the Lord he's the one worthy of that not me but very type of Christ himself with his own eternal life with him but smitten Rock poured his life upon the ground as a sin offering for us that this word could live amen oh Gentiles as I have said who will pull that sword with me he wants a fresh drink this morning not this old stagnated church Creeds and things were fooling around with be more genuine faith in his words let's go to the well and bring back a drink a refreshment a worship that's built upon not crazy in a nomination but a genuine Spirit Worship with Christ among us living his life the way he wants to Among Us that's not with Credence different things that's just just having that way now the next was how God dealt with the people through a dream in the days of uh Joseph A Dream Is secondarily it's a secondary way of God where some people don't have dreams don't mean nothing you can eat too much and have nightmares and dream is the secondarily way see well why would God protect his own son through a secondary way he appeared to Joseph the welfare of his own child he sent in a secondarily way did you ever think of it cause there was no prophet in the land he had to work through dreams and it wasn't a dream that had to be interpreted the angel of the Lord said Joseph fear not to take an email why for that which is conceived in hers of the Holy Ghost is an unusual thing for that to happen Joseph being a just man he it was unusual God is unusual and the unusual is hard to understand that's why it's so hard to understand truth today is so unusual yeah a woman to have a baby without knowing a man that was very unusual but if you're honest and sincere God can appear to you yet in a dream that goes to show that anything that you have whether it's your mind where you can whistle sing testify or whatever you can do if your whole being is committed to God God can use it if you just let him do it then the following night up here brother Neville preached on the subject of escaping how the the man escaped and I thought it's kind of remarkable and this morning the Holy Spirit seems to have me to deal upon the subject of the light the very next go right on in the beginning how Christ's life started at the manger we're walking right back through it again in our text and he didn't know it I didn't know it and here it is right the same thing see right on the next thing is where he enters this ministry and tonight we got something to blend right with that to go right on tonight the Lord willing now great light the Gentiles you set in the regions of the Shadows of death great light spring up among them and Zebulon and Nephilim in the for the way of Galilee of the Gentiles great light they saw a great light now light the first time like we find in the Bible is found in Genesis 1 3 it was God's spoken word made the light that's right God said let there be light Genesis 1 3. and there was life I remember that light comes by the spoken word of God and light is the vindication are the subject that he has spoke his life when the light flies shows that God said let there be light there was no light and he said let there be light and there was light that's a proof the light is a Vindication of a spoken word same thing today amen a Vindication obvious spoken word now when you see his word being Vindicated or other words made known prove that is a the light of his spoken word and without light nothing can live without life there is no life upon the Earth today that but what has to come by the the light of the Sun in a botany life and so forth and there's no eternal life outside of the Son of God Amen he is the light now we find out I believe as we study now and uh this light the Earth was without form now some people argue today in our schools and so forth about the world being so many million years old and trying to condemn the Bible it say it's wrong they just don't never read the Bible That's all because the Bible don't tell us how old the world is the Bible said in the beginning God created heavens and earth period when how that's we don't know it now that's the first that's a period that's the end of that sentence in the beginning God created the heavens Earth it might have been 100 million or billion or whatever it was and how you done it that's up to him to know see not to me but the world or the Earth was our farm and void and the water was up on the the Earth and God said clued up on the water and said let there be light hey now I believe that the Sun and so forth was already in existence I believe the moon as it goes on Genesis 3 to explain it but I believe what was here that the world we is going to use it and therefore and it moved in there was fog missed all over the Earth making it dark and God said let there be light and the Darkness faded away and there was a cloudless sky that's God's way of doing things he in the Bible the next verse says the fourth verse says and he separated the light from the darkness and the light he called day and the dark as he called night and God's word always separates light from Darkness it's the word that does the separating light from Darkness God ever does the same thing when he gets ready to use anything like he got ready to use this old star or whatever it was this world he had to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to leave to use a a group of people he has to separate the light from the darkness when he gets so ready to use it individually he separates the light from the darkness light comes by God and the remember the light come by his spoken word the word of God said let there be light when there was no light yeah and he sent the light to separate the darkness from the light this word of command cleared the skies so the sun could shine in and his word today is what clears back all of the atmospheres of unbelief us talking I had to think 11 interviews just forgot to Pulpit this morning in there so bad the other day a little friend of mine Jim Poole his little boy I thought he had a heart attack rushed in the hospital was an ass minute condition it took a little fella he couldn't his little heart jumping and breathing and he's screaming and couldn't get his breath and little fell looked like he was dying when he got in here and I was fixing to go to the hospital they brought him here and took all his little hand I said what's done it measles has struck the kid and the measles the fever and struck the little fella you watch him in a couple days I want to see him again he'll be full of measles and here he is full of measles you see now what God separates Darkness from light or light from darkness and he separates death from life and he does it by his word his word is what always brings this forth now life well now the seed was already upon the earth I believe God had planted the seed and just as long as the son could get to that seed it began to grow and that's reason only taken days to bring forth these things because the seed was already in the Earth but only was life and that's why God has today his seed is already here his word the only thing it needs is light on him and he is that light amen for he is the word the word and the light is the same thing the life in there is a light of the word is the life The Germ of Life lays within the Grain and the grain the life is what breaks forth and brings forth the life out of the green that's why the Christ in the word makes the word do what he's supposed to do just like the life in the grain of wheat or whatever it is it makes the wheat do what it's supposed to do because it is the life that's in it all life so life is only by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God made manifest as long as it is just in the book like this it still it can be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what is spoke of being manifested that that is light on the on the word see that's what brings the word said so and then when it comes to pass that is life in life light bringing life light brings life plank the weed out ear it'll put it in the basement cover it all over and it'll it'll never bring forth anything because it can't there's no light there but as soon as light strikes it then it'll bring forth life if it's a dermatized seed that's the same thing it is in the word see the word is God Among the life strikes it it brings it the light strikes it it brings the word to life again every age has always been that all how we appreciate these great things how that the word being Vindicated is the life of the spoken word amen see God said let there be light now what if he just said it until I come then we don't know it's true or not that's right we don't worry he's all right we don't know where he's God or not because he just said let there be and there wasn't see so then when God speaks and we see it is then that's the light that shines forth the truth all the words see there is light and light all natural life comes by his spoken word and the son is his spoken word he said he created great light in the heavens for the day and a lesser light for the night see and all natural life has to come by God's spoken word amen a fire cannot grow without the light of God's spoken word shine upon him for the son is the s-u-n is the spoken word of God when he said let there be life okay it's God's spoken life and no matter how much people try to to say this side or the other it Still Remains the Same you have to have that son so life natural can only come by the spoken word of God and spiritual life eternal life can only come by God's Spoken Word of Life life was a s o in this time in him is life and in him is no darkness and he is God's spoken light is that right God's spoken word or in the beginning why is the word the word is with God and the Word was God and it's forever God see and it takes the life of God to strike the word to make it live here's what he spoke now let the light shine let the light shine and the light will bring every word to its right position in a season amen amen glory oh you see when it comes time sometimes that green lays the Earth dormant all through the the winter I like to see the winter wheat sowed in the ground but when that sun gets just right oh it's got to live amen see and he can't live without the sun right and God's made promises for every age and every day and when the light gets right and shines upon that it'll produce just exactly what the word said because he is the light and the light God's word comes only by the Bible God's Bible is the the printed form of the Son of God because the Bible said that it is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's God revealing himself through Christ and Christ is the word and it takes the light of God to shine upon that word defindicated to prove that God still speaks life eternal life he speaks natural eye brings to life life only comes by the Light the word made manifests or made flesh when all the promises become uh in the Bible become manifest is when Jesus Christ the word was made flesh Among Us God always works through man man is God's subject wow we're just getting going but we've got plenty to get into the next time men so you can see brother Ben was just starting to get into a subject and that's our first question what is the subject that brother Branham is going to speak on so let's look at paragraph 34. this is a real simple one paragraph 34 on page seven and he goes to the bottom of that paragraph he says for the take this for a text there was a man here that can turn on the light and now we're going to speak on the subject of light so his title is there's a man here who can turn on the light but the subject he's wanting to talk about is light and we saw that from the here on he starts talking about light so we want to look at that question number two why is Christ a fugitive to his own church let's look down at paragraph 38 uh at the top of page eight the next page what a type it is today of Christ a fugitive you say Christ is a fugitive according to the Bible God has God has gallantly taken us through those seven Church ages this laodicean church Christ was a fugitive outside of his church rejected trying to get back in he is a fugitive to his own church and the reason he is a fugitive is because he is the word and they won't let the word in they've accepted Creeds instead so so no church there's no church that you can walk into any church that you walk into you can never say Christ is a fugitive outside this church and get them to believe it they think they're inviting Christ in they think they're believing in Jesus Christ my brother Branham is showing Christ is a fugitive and we find that in Revelations chapter 3 he behold he stands at the door and knock he's outside he's been put outside the church amen but the the the understanding in churches is that not that Christ is on the outside they don't understand how Christ is on the outside because they sing about Christ they preach about Christ they use the name of Jesus Christ all the time but brother Branham draws an equal sign between Christ and the word and when you take the Creed and reject the word you pushed Christ onto the outside and he says so now it's not just a denominational thing now it's us amen now anytime we take our own idea over the word we've rejected Christ and he can become a fugitive to our life is because we take our own idea and not the word so we don't want Christ to be a fugitive in this house in this church I don't want him to be a fugitive I want him to be welcome amen so I have to receive the word all of the word amen not my own Creed let's look at paragraph 45 at the top of the next page page nine so is it today the least of Jesus's thoughts or how about his word should be a command to we Gentiles who love him for we know he's coming into power so brother Branham now is talking he's typing the story of David outside Bethlehem longing for a Cool Drink From The Well of Bethlehem and those Gentile Warriors that were with him they cut their way through 15 miles of Philistines and come back bring him a water not in Brothers not because he asked them to but because that he desired it and now he's starting to show the Gentile way amen not the Jewish way to follow the law but the Gentile way is to love the Lord and want to do for him not keep a order this is such a higher order so he shows he said that David there as a fugitive is a type of Christ it's a type of the church Christ is a fugitive in the Legacy and church age but there's Gallant Gentiles Warriors that attach themselves to them because they know he's coming to power and so that's a type of us now on the last day were those Gallant Gentile Warriors amen because the fugitive has been pushed out but we've gone out to him and now we're living in the caves with him and now not not because it's a law not because I have to not because he said you better but as if I know his least desire that becomes a commandment to me and now I love him so much and recognize who he is that I will do the least of his desires becomes a commandment to me so I love the way brother bear types is and he shows where our heart should really be because our heart is not and tell me what the rule is and I'll keep the rule maybe for the sake of being safe behind the rule or being saved because of the rule now has nothing to do with the rules I recognize what this word is amen it's Christ and the least of his desire is my commandment now I do it not because I have to but because I want to so now we're going to read the next sentence for we know he's coming into Power no matter how much he's rejected heavens and earth will pass away but this will still Reign just the same when all heavens and earth is gone and we know he's coming into Power because nothing will keep it from happening it says brother brown patches Bible he says this is Christ so he's talking about his Bible this is Christ the revelation of him and this is going to happen just the way the word says it is because he is the word and the least of his commands there no matter how little is this if it's to be re-baptized or whatever it is we'll do it anyhow it's his command so you have people sometimes I mentioned this many many times but sometimes you have people when you're talking to them not necessarily even people believe the message but you're talking about the word and they'll ask you if that's Heaven or Hell issue will I go to hell if I don't do that and and for me that's always been the most mind-boggling question if you know God wants something why why do you ask if it's a heaven or hell issue if you know that's what God wants then don't you have a desire to please God isn't there something in you that that even if it's inconvenient for me even if I have to die to my own thinking even if I have to if it's painful for me in the flesh if that's what God desires then there's something in me that wants to give him what he desires and that's what these Gentile Warriors had so question number three how does light come so brother Brandon's subject is light then we want to know how light comes and let's look at paragraph 58 at the top half of page 11. paragraph 58 now light the first time light we find it in the Bible is found in Genesis 1 3 it was God's spoken word made the light God said let there be light Genesis 1 3 and there was light now remember then light comes by the spoken word of God so how does light come by the spoken word of God this becomes really important because the theme some things he's getting ready to say and light is the Vindication or the subject that he has spoke as light and when light flies shows that God said let there be light there was no light and he said let there be light and there was light that's a proof the light is a Vindication of his spoken word same thing today a Vindication of a spoken word now when you see his word being Vindicated or other words made known prude that is the light of his spoken word and without light nothing can live without light there is no life upon the Earth today that but that has to come by the Light of the sun and a botany life and so forth and there is no eternal life outside the Son of God see he is the light so there is no life without that light both naturally and spiritually so life must come by the spoken word and when that word is Vindicated or proved or made manifest then that is light and that light brings life so you have to have the light of the spoken word or the word made manifest to have life that becomes so critical because that there's there's there's uh as many church denominations as you want to mention and churches on every street corner but how many are bringing life because life must come by the spoken word made Vindicated that's we want to be in life amen and light brings life question number four what does God do when he gets ready to use anything paragraph 65 at the top of page 12. paragraph 65. and I believe that's God's way of doing things in the Bible the next verse says the fourth verse says and he separated the light from the darkness and the light he called day in the darkness he called night and God's word always separates light from Darkness it's the word that does the separating see light from Darkness God God ever does the same thing when he gets ready to use anything so what does God do whenever he gets ready to use anything God separates light from Darkness like he's got ready to use this old Star War whatever it was this world he had to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to leave or to use a group of people he has to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to use an individual he separates the light from the darkness lights come by God remember the light come by his spoken word the word of God said let there be light then there was no light and he sent the light to separate the darkness from the light this word of command cleared the sky so the sun sun could shine in and his word today is what clears back all the atmospheres of unbelief let's skip down to paragraph 71 at the bottom of the page now what God separates Darkness from light or light from darkness and he separates death from life and he does it by his word his word is what always brings forth So Gone first thing he did was he spoke and when he spoke it became manifest or it was proven or became light when the light was the manifestation of the spoken word and that light is the as the word made flash actually separated the darkness from the light it was the word that did it when the word was made manifest it automatically separated light from dark so we say if any time God's going to use anybody he first separates the light from the dark so I've got to separate light from dark in my life no you don't have to separate light from dark in your life all you have to do is receive the light the light itself will separate light from dark there's nothing for you to do but receive the light yield to the light recognize the light acknowledge the light and walk in the light and the light will separate the light from the darkness so many times we try to clean ourselves up then serve God how about just serve God and let the light do the separating praise God that's the power of the spoken word all right question number five life comes by what so he's already alluded to this let's look at middle of page 13. paragraph 74. so life is only by the word of God made manifest oh praise God aren't you glad you live in the day when the word of God has been made manifest and you can have Life By the Light of the word amen not dead denominationalism not darkness of Creeds and dogmas but there's been a revelation that has manifest itself in this day that brings light and light brings life so now we can have life amen oh praise God so life is only by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God made manifest I love how he said that only life comes only by the word of God made manifest as long as it's it is just in book like this it still can be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word that that what brings the word said so and then when it comes to pass that is life and light light brings Life Light brings life do you want to come to life then you've got to get in the light what is the light the word made manifest in this day The Living Word is light and light brings life look at paragraph 75 plant the wheat out here and put it in the basement cover it all over it'll never bring forth anything because it can there's no light there but as soon as light strikes it then it'll bring forth life if it's a dermatized seed so now we we talk about the wheat the the and brother bam talks many times about the wheat being a type of the word it's it's symbolic of the word you can take that word amen and hide it away from the Sun and it'll never reproduce it'll never spring forth to life amen Buddha when it gets in the sun especially when it gets in the right kind of sun for that crop but that way because wheat comes to life at a certain time amen corn at another time beans at another time but when it gets in the right sunlight for the condition for it to grow and to ripen amen it brings forth life out of that seed amen but that seed must be in contact it must be in the light so you can have the word amen but to make the word live it takes the light of the Vindicated word to make the word live why is that so important because in you is word there's a sieging of God there's a part of the word laying in you amen part of the wheat seed and it has to come to life but it can't come to life until it gets in the light and the light is the word made manifest which is the message of the hour and that will bring you to life that's really what he's talking about all right let's look at paragraph 77. all natural life comes by a spoken word I'm sorry let's go back up and finish paragraph 75 I read the first part of it and let's read the second part that's the same thing it is in the word see the word is God I thought he said earlier that the word is Christ Sarah said the word is God are we confused or do we see it amen the word is God and when the life strikes it the light strikes it it brings the word to life again every age has always been them oh how we appreciate these great things how the word being Vindicated is the light of the spoken word God said let there be light now down to paragraph 77 all natural life comes by his spoken word and the Sun is the spoken word he said he created a great light in the heavens for the day and a lesser light for the night and all natural life has to come by God's spoken word a flower cannot grow without the light of God's spoken word to shine upon it for the son as the s-u-n is the spoken word of God when he said let there be light see it's God's spoken life and no matter how much people try to say this that or the other it Still Remains the Same you have to have that son so life natural can only come by the spoken word of God and the spiritual life eternal life can only come by God's Spoken Word of Life life was the son this time in him is light and in him is no darkness and he is God's spoken light is that right God's spoken word for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and it's forever God so is the word forever God and is the word Christ and it takes the light of God to strike the word to make it live it takes the light of God to strike the word to make it live what is the light of God the word made manifest for your day has to strike the word for this day which is you to make it live that's why you can't come to life a seed for this day cannot come to life without the message of the hour it is the light for the age that brings life praise God let's read let's keep reading and it takes the light of God to strike the word to make it live here is what he spoke referring to the Bible now let the light shine amen let the light shine and the light will bring every word to its right position in its season there you got it the light will bring every word to its position in its season you can say God what am I supposed to do what's my existence upon the Earth what do you want me to do just lay in the presence of the sun and the sun will bring every seed to its right position whatever God has ordained for you to do you will do when you stay in the light the light will bring the life out of the seed into full maturity and it will manifest itself so we don't look for something to do we don't ask God what to do and try to find a work to do or a calling or a commission we just walk in the light as he's in the line that light will bring the life out of the scene so stay with the light it'll do everything it's supposed to do so light will bring every word to its right position in its season when it comes time sometimes that grain lays in the earth dormant all through the winter like seed winter wheat sowed in the ground but when the sun gets just right it's got to live and it can't live without the Sun so sometimes you can you can live a long time with a seed in your life and that seed never Springs forth to life until you get in the right light amen and the right light in the right season in the right time which is the message of the hour will hit the right seed that needs that condition to come to life and it'll spring forth to life praise God paragraph 80. God's word comes only by the Bible God's Bible is the printed form of the son of God because the Bible said that it is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's God revealing himself through Christ and Christ is the word I thought God was the word I thought the word is forever God and it's Christ is the word and it takes the light of God to shine upon that word to vindicate it to prove that God still speaks life eternal life he speaks natural light brings to life life only comes by the Light the word made manifest or made flesh life only comes by the Light which is the word made flesh when all the promises become in the Bible become manifest is when Jesus Christ the word was made flesh Among Us God always works through man man is God's subject there you got it so if God is going to show manifested light in this day how will he do it he just told you God always works through man and man is God's subject so therefore the commission is to you and I who have received this word and come to life the commission has arise Shine for thy light has come now the light is to shine out of us as the Bride of Jesus Christ and that light being the manifested word can bring another seed to life when it comes in contact with that light amen let's all stand these are I went through this message just myself studying it back sometime in the summer and that's when I decided to do it as our tape service because these things started striking me with such impact brother Benham kind of quickly goes to this concept and he starts talking about light and life brings life and life and the light brings to seed to life but when you really stop and meditate on what he's saying you realize the impact of what it means to have the word made manifest in our day is the it brings the possibility of the word coming to life of the seed coming to life without it that's why the the when the church is rejected Christ in this day they put the light away from them and light separates Darkness from line that's why you can't stay in the system or your own system or separated from the light in any way whether in another church or in your own mind you can't stay separated from the light and expect to come to life we can only come to life amen when we stay in the presence of the sun and the sun brings the word that's in us to life and then all of a sudden when you realize what this is we become so grateful that God has rescued us out of the darkness amen because where did laodicea go it went into a total blackout amen is signified by the blackout of the moon and the eclipse the seventh picture wasn't even in the paper because it was totally black showing that the church has gone into apostasy we could never come to life there we had to come to life under the word for our day and all of a sudden all I can say is thank you God because I had no power to produce the light I had nothing in me that could make the light to shine to bring what was buried deep inside of this Earth to life amen and and who knew that laying under this part of dirt was life just like you go he types it with the creation amen back in Genesis 1 there's dirt everywhere who knows where there's germinated seed laying amen who knew who could walk and say there's a palm tree there's an oak tree this spot here who would know but God but God was going to show where the seed was and the way he would manifest the seed was to shine the light and when he shined the light it would manifest the seed so who knew that in Lima Ohio or Cincinnati Ohio or Lebanon Ohio or wherever you happen to be to be who knew that down in that patch of dirt was a seed amen who knew there was a sieging of God who could point and say that's one and that's nobody could you were just dead earth like the the beginning at the beginning of Genesis but God shined the light in this day through the message of the hour and when you came in contact with that line he showed where his seed was it was laying in that patch of dirt there and that patch of dirt there and that patch of dirt there and it wasn't because we decided to be something it wasn't because we changed our mind it was because he planted that seed in this dirt before the foundation of the world and he made the light to shine we didn't make the light to shine and that light began to pull something out of the seed it wasn't what we did it's what we surrendered ourselves to that's what the word did the word that was shining in this day and the word that was trapped in my heart the word brought the word to life the light brought life and the life brings light and we didn't do anything we were just here oh aren't you grateful for the message aren't you thankful for the word of God this is so much more than a an interesting sermon and an acute title there is a man here not only that can't turn on the light there's a man here who has turned on the lights and the light is shining for those who can see it and that light is here to bring a certain seed for a certain season to life receive the light and let it bring the seed in you to life and the same light that caused it to Spring forth is the same spoken word light that'll bring it to full maturity and have that seed bearing fruit and all you have to do is stay in the light amen let's bow our heads musicians if you can come and blink if you can come dear heavenly father we thank you so much for this message Lord God it seems so trivial to say that just thank you but from the depths of our heart we thank you I can never Lord have done anything for myself I could have never done anything to help myself I could have never saved myself I could have never changed me there was no power in me to do anything but God you brought a message in this end time and you Vindicated your word to bring the right light in the right season to bring life to the seeds that you had planted for this age and God all we can say is thank you thank you Lord for planting your seed in my dirt thank you for your predestinated plan thank you for shining the light thank you for letting the light come in contact with this vessel so you could bring out of this dirt your very own life but we're not worthy we're not deserving we haven't done anything but oh we are so grateful God we thank you for this word that you've given us I pray that Lord as we leave from here that we would ruminate on these things and they would become living realities within us not statements of a minister not things from a tape not things that strike our Earthly natural ears but Lord a light that will penetrate the soil and bring life to the seed on the inside God within each of us let your light separate the light from the darkness in US let the light drive the darkness far away pushing it out of the way so that your life can come forth we love you and we thank you for your word we ask that you bless us as we go from here and Lord may we walk in this world as your manifested word your spoken word when you spoke of a gentile bride when you spoke that there would be a bride that would make herself ready Lord May that spoken word be manifest in US and may that be light in this day and may that light bring life well do the work that we cannot do as we yield to you we trust in you and we thank you Father we give you our lives afresh and we commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all like we'll we'll walk in the light it's such a beautiful light comes with they do the Dew drops of Mercy our bride shine all around us Jesus [Applause] [Music] such a beautiful
