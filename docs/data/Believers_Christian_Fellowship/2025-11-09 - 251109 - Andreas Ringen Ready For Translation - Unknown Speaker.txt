We're going to let you have your seats for just a moment. Certainly good to be here with you and so glad we can be together and very thankful that brother Andreas made it safely in. He had no problems with his flight. So, we thank God for that. And uh we're going to have him here in just a few minutes. But before that, I'd like to start with a baby dedication. Amen. And so, if Brother Adam and Sister Alana Preston would like to bring their little guy up, you guys can make your way up front. So, good to have them back in the service again. They're bringing forward little Andrew [music] James Preston. I looked at his name. This boy has quite a name. Andrew means strong and manly. [music] And James uh we know James is the same name as Jacob. It means suppler, but it means one who can overcome by force or other means. So this boy is going to be a victor. Amen. Amen. [music] Praise God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Look at his bow tie. Hey there, buddy. Let's all bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're so grateful that we [music] can stand, Lord, together, Lord, with this baby in our arms. And we know when you were here on earth, you took the children into your arms and you blessed them, Lord. And God, we want to put a blessing upon little Andrew James. God, that you'd watch over his life, Lord. For he's a gift that you've given to my brother and sister here, Lord, that you have entrusted this life into their hands. [music] And they recognize that by delivering him back to you in a in an act of dedication. Lord, they dedicate not only this life back to you, but they dedicate [music] themselves to nurture and guide this little life. Lord, I pray you bless Adam and you give him wisdom and strength, Lord, to make a living for this child that he might, Lord, provide for his every need, Lord. that he might lead him, Lord, as a shepherd leads sheep. Lord, I pray that you bless Sister Alana, Lord, and she would give the nurture and love and care that little Andrew needs so he could develop into all that you've predestined [music] for him to be. May you shield him and protect him from every fiery dart of the enemy. Lord, may you be his shield. May you be his protector. And may you guide him all the days of his life. And may he grow to know you, Lord, in a personal way through a personal experience while he's young. Lord, may he always walk with you. May he never have to stray away, but may he serve you all the days of his life. And God, help us as a congregation to [music] support this couple and this family. Help us to support them with prayer, with any physical means necessary and our love and our our comfort and our our securing them within our midst. Lord, may we just be a blessing to them as you've entrusted them with this life. [music] And we just want to say thank you, Lord, for it's a privilege, Lord, to hold this little baby. It's a privilege to hand him back to his mother and father and see, God, that [music] you're still using your children. You're still bringing forth life. And you have a plan and a purpose in our lives, and it's being [music] fulfilled in our daily lives. We ask that you would bless them in [music] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you both. Amen. What a good little baby. Amen. God bless you. Oh, praise God. Amen. Well, that is wonderful. Thank you guys. And if that wasn't wonderful enough, I have an announcement to make. There was another baby born Thursday evening. So, if we could bring the the picture up, Brother Donovan, Sister Stephanie Fiser had their little baby boy on Thursday evening. Isaiah Peter Fiser. I mean, if you'll notice, he's 11B. And that's not a typo. I confirmed that that is correct. And so I I thought and 23 in long. And she had him at home. He looks like he might be like 2 months old there, but he was born on Thursday. And so, uh, Sister Stephanie delivered him at home Thursday evening. Everybody's doing really well. Everything went marvelously well. But I think she deserves a trophy or a plaque or some some great recognition. Amen. Did a wonderful job. So, we're so grateful for them and that they're all doing well. May the Lord bless them and and God is just good, friends. I'm just so thankful to dwell in the goodness of God and thank God for his manifold blessings for it's wonderful to be here. Also, I wanted to let you know that I asked Wednesday night for prayer for some brethren in Nigeria. And I had told you that there was um um some bandits there and that they were taken captive. Five brethren along with other people. I got word yesterday from brother Gideon that all five of the captive brethren have been released. So, we want to thank God for that. [applause] Amen. I tell you friends, it's wonderful to serve a living God and we're so grateful for that. So also we've got quite a few visitors here. So we want to make all the visitors feel welcome. Brother Jose Paulac has some friends visiting. Brother Steven and Sister Ruth Butrol visiting here all the way from Dton, Ohio. They made the long journey over. Amen. They they fellowship there with brother Steven Goldsby. God bless you. It's good to have you guys here with us. and also brother Ilia's brother Alex and his wife Rachel are visiting here from Idaho. So God bless you guys as well. It's good to have you. And then this morning I bumped into the the Fieldings. The Fieldings have guests here, visitors from Arizona, brothers and sister Brian and Sarah Balowski. So God bless you all. It's good to have you here with us too. Amen. So we want you all to feel welcome. Amen. Feel welcome amongst us. It's good to have you. And any other visitors I didn't mention, we want you to feel welcome as well. say, "God bless you for joining with us this morning." Amen. If we could all stand, we're going to turn the service over to Brother Andreas and allow him to come and share what the Lord's laid on his heart. Amen. Brother Andreas is famous among us as Sister Zabilis, pastor. And I told him it's his that's his claim to fame. But but you know, for years I I was aware of Brother Andreas, we have some mutual friends. I've heard so many good reports and I had such a desire to meet him and he had made an invitation for me to come and I couldn't take it and I had been inviting him and he couldn't make [clears throat] it but eventually God allowed it to work out and I found a wonderful brother and a friend and I have been the benefactor of his friendship and of our times together been quite a blessing to me I mean he was here uh last year and ministered to Wednesday night for us and I was quite blessed with the service as well and so very much looking forward to this morning to see what the Lord will do through our brother and through the gift that he placed within him. And so we want him to find welcome. And you guys know how to do that. Just pull on that word. Just respond. Amen. To God working through the brother and he'll relax and he'll fall right into place and we'll we'll absorb all that God has for us this morning and enjoy it. Amen. So we'd like to invite brother Andreas now with the song. Brother Blake. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. [singing] Oh, and I lift [singing] my voice [singing] to [music] worship you, oh my [music] soul. Rejoice. [singing] Take joy my king [music] in [singing] what you hear. [music] [singing] May be a sweet, sweet. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that one more time together. [music] I love you, Lord. Oh, I [singing] [music] love you, Lord, and [music] I [singing] live my voice [music] [singing] to worship [music] you, oh [singing] my soul. [music] Rejoice.

[sighs] Greet you all in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Surely surely surely a great great great privilege for me to be here again. Amen. And uh uh what then really enjoying what the Lord has done. See everything I believe uh that we meet here is just predestinated. So and uh so I always marvel about the plans of God and the ways of God and uh so we are just graceful and grateful what the Lord has done with us. And uh thank you brother Chad for for that uh for that uh uh warm welcome and not only brother Chad but all of you. Thank you. God bless you. It's always nice uh to preach to believers. Amen. It's always nice to speak to believers. Amen. Amen. So as we uh um I just want to bring the greetings I um the greetings uh I have to bring to you especially from brother Marcus Becca I have I should not forget uh I don't don't call him my in-law but uh our our kids have married so and uh from him and surely his wife and also brother Groalt I want to bring the greetings I think I should really not forget and sister the bill for sure I think uh uh they all sent their greetings and also I I have to bring you I want to and have to bring you greetings from brother from brother from Africa brother Steven Ibal and brother freight Karingi. Uh and last time I was here last year I was here um um you just really uh um u blessed us and also the work over there. And uh as I went back in December, uh we had a we had a very very uh big meeting amongst uh um Pentecostal believers uh many thousands came together and so we could share a little bit about what God has done in our day and uh so um then a thing was born there to uh because those denominational believers they didn't had Bibles. So it was really amazing how that truly developed and what the Lord could do and [clears throat] how the Lord could speak and [snorts] I just want to let you know and thank you from those brothers you are involved in it so and we could manage to get over there 10,000 Bibles middle of this year uh those people received Bibles and it was I think it was so amazing for those believers denominational believers uh not really message believers denominational believers but they never their denomination had no interest in giving them Bibles and you can understand what that is for an impact for them now because now they see uh that the message is not just interested in members &gt;&gt; but is interested in souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a great great effect and a great blessing. So thank you very much and this is what I should not forget to let you know. Amen. So greetings from those brothers. Amen. God bless you all. I don't have to introduce myself. You all know me. Uh let's go straight. Thank you musicians. Let's go straight into the word. because I uh uh I have uh something I always am a little bit afraid that I will be too long. So uh we don't want to use too much time in in things that don't need to be done. Uh let's open. I want to speak this morning. Something really um I said to brother Chad something I actually came by with a complete different thought and as I was coming and things developed really the Lord put this on my heart in a in a in a special way and I want to speak this morning on ready for translation. &gt;&gt; I just want to speak on ready for translation. And let's turn our Bibles and go to first Corinthians. Uh 1 Corinthians, we want to go and read, we want to read three scriptures. [snorts] Okay. Yes. Thank you. 1 Corinthians, we want to read the sixth chapter. 1 Corinthians 6 from 9 to 11. And I [snorts] have to read that just as as really some uh picture in the background that we really also understand of what we speak today this morning. um because it's surely a question what it means to be ready &gt;&gt; and what it really means to be ready and I and we understand that uh we are here and uh there is a necessarity to be ready for translation. Amen. So let's let's uh chapter 6 uh 1 Corinthians 69-11. [snorts] Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolattors, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themsel with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetousness, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you, but ye are washed, but yet are sanctified, but yet are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How wonderful the scripture turns here. Keep that really in mind. Ye are washed. Ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God. Amen. Let's turn then to Luke 18. Luke 18. I want to read another very uh well-known [snorts] scripture. Luke 18, we want to read 9-14. [clears throat] Luke 18 9-14. And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themsel that they were righteous and despised others. Two men went up in the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself. God, I thank thee that I'm not, as the other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even at this publican. I fast twice in the week. I give tithe of all that I possess. And the publican stand a would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smokeote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone that exaltth himself shall be abased, but he that humbles himself shall be exalted. &gt;&gt; That man went home justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one more scripture, James 5:16-18. I think you know me. I I just like to read the scriptures all in the beginning. And because I know you are very uh flexible and well trained well well uh yeah well trained so you will you will see how it fits during the service. &gt;&gt; Amen. James 5 I want to read 16 to 18. Confess your faults one to to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed. The effectual fever prayer of a righteous man availth much. And we have just heard that this man went home righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the fever prayer of a righteous man availth much. And now watch very very carefully how beautiful here something is put in. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are. And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain. And it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit. Amen. Isn't that amazing? As the Bible speaks of a a a man, a righteous man, then it turns to Elias and tells us that he was a man like passion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's pray. [snorts] Heavenly Father, you're so wonderful and you're so great. Lord, your work is marvelous. And we just want to come to you this morning with a heart of thanksgiving. And Father, with an honor unto you, because you are the only one that should receive honor and glory, Father, and everything that we do this morning, this service as we speak, may you anoint your word. May you anoint the one that is speaking and the ones that are listening, Father, that we are all involved, that you can pull us into what you are doing amongst us, Father. And uh and just prepare us for the days to come. We ask it, Father, all to your honor and to your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you enjoy [snorts] your seats. Amen. So we uh we uh just actually want to I want to start with a statement of the prophet actually um that he that he made also uh concerning the time that we are living in and and then we want to um we want to really do a little journey this morning uh a little journey in what God is doing, how far we are already. uh you know um we see uh we see uh modern events that was years ago made clear by prophecy but those modern events are not only made clear by prophecy but now they are made clear as they are happening &gt;&gt; and uh and so we are and and we understand there's not many things that maybe has to happen and will happen um as we even brother random re speaking years ago already [snorts] so and uh we are just standing ing there. We are just standing here and uh the last I think the great thing the last thing according to Romans will be the change of our bodies. Is it right? That we are facing. So and we want to really to see um uh uh what it means to be ready for that. What it really means to be ready and I think this is surely a question uh that comes up. Are we ready? Uh how are we ready? You know what means readiness? what means really readiness and uh and and as we go along this is really the thought behind it. Brother Venom would say in the message uh uh Balamin Gilead 19 in the 50s he says he just uh is you're just that way as it is just simple as you are going home uh I'm going out and start the car that's all an act of faith &gt;&gt; right tomorrow I will meet you in a certain place that's all an act of faith because you have just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, that's the way the things of God are. &gt;&gt; After you have trusted him and waited him and so many and seen him so many things, it becomes like a regular routine. &gt;&gt; And this is the condition I think the church will be in just before the coming of the Lord. So the rapture will just go on right that way. It will be a regular routine &gt;&gt; of following the scriptures and the plans of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you understand. So it's it's I think u um as the prophet would would just just bring it. It will be it it's just a regular routine because you have done it so many times &gt;&gt; it just becomes something. And then brother Renham further said uh in in in the message and knoweth it not and he said let think uh of the loudysene church age and its condition today. As far as I know I don't see see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of the readiness of his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so and we all understand when we speak of the coming of the Lord that includes the change of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the coming of the Lord um and we understand in this time uh is is uh is is something that is still mysterious because we we all understand that it will be a secret coming. Is that right? It will be just a secret coming. And uh Jesus would say the world will not see me but you shall see me because I will be with you and I will be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So so uh as we are as we are seeing that speaking of readiness and brother Adam said at that time already he said I can see nothing what hinders the coming of the Lord. And I really uh uh want to want to put that down. The coming of the Lord as it is a process. It did come to its finalization as Romans 8 would let us know which is the final step of the do adoption, the change of our bodies. &gt;&gt; And we understand all that we are very far advanced in the rapture already. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are very far advanced. What was once started is not just starting anymore, &gt;&gt; but it's far advanced. And I believe we are just standing at the brink of just one thing is missing and that is the body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe I believe we are we are even much further than the prophet would look at at this at his time where he was standing in 1965. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are we are we are much further than that. And we will see that maybe this mo this this morning a little bit how far we are. And then surely the question always will rise are we ready for the change? what it means to be ready for the change &gt;&gt; with all the circumstances that are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it it really it really um because as I would say as the prophet left the scene with the church with the believers, the situation became actually not more easy and not not more simple, but situations became more complicated and more tensed. Is it right? As the Bible would let us know, when the enemy comes in like a flood, &gt;&gt; God then said God would raise up a standard against it. And brother Mam is asking the people, are you the standard? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you the standard? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the standard being raised, are you the standard? So and we see how the enemy comes in like in fact brother Adam I think 50 60 years ago look how he was looking at things and situation. He found it terrible. He found it difficult. But what about today? &gt;&gt; Amen. What about today? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are closer to the body change than ever. &gt;&gt; So there must be a readiness. &gt;&gt; Right. There must be a readiness. &gt;&gt; And I know that's the question. Are we ready for the body change? &gt;&gt; What mean? What does it mean to be ready? &gt;&gt; You know when I am ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. When I'm ready because I believe the bride will go home in great victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. the bride will go home in great victory. When the prophet left the scene, Christ remained behind. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we are fellowshipping today, not so much with the prophet anymore himself, but with Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what we really want to look uh uh very close this morning. And as we have read the story of Luke 19, I I I thought this this this makes it and and because that man, it's it's very interesting that man, what did he do to to to get justified to his home? &gt;&gt; But the Bible said he went home justified. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; I mean, this is a wonderful situation, you understand? Not only forgiven, but justified. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you understand when the prophet would speak of this hour, he said, "No, the true bride, the the the church of the living God is not only forgiven." &gt;&gt; She stands justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what and I trust because we have to stand justified because now we are married. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. because of marriage something happens. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that man here it's it's it's very important. Look look look uh and I I think it shows it shows very very clear how important for readiness and for to be ready is the right kind of attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] let me let me really linger a little on that because um and right kind of attitude as brother Renham would say according to every promise that God has made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the rapture is the change of the body a promise? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, and brother Brennan would say, allow me allow me quickly. I think it's it's a beautiful uh uh statement that he that he made in one of the one of the sermons. Um I think awakening uh awakening Jesus. I think he said that. Brother Wam said awakening Jesus. And that's also very good to know. Um it is not really your mental attitude that does it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's it's not really let let's let's really see how the prophet is really declaring it nicely. And brother Ranom would say he said you see the mental attitude you take towards now the mind won't do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you give that attitude towards something not that has life in it, then that life comes down and does it. &gt;&gt; So your right mental attitude towards him. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he will do it. &gt;&gt; So So and it's it's actually very simple. We understand and I could see that this this man and it becomes very obvious in the Bible. H also why brother Renham would say the word is in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we go to Mary a little bit a little bit later um he the prophet would say that as the Holy Spirit would have told him pick up the pen and write. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There actually it comes out that the word is in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. He could have chosen any other type. There's any wonderful types in the Bible of women. I mean Sarah would be a brilliant type. &gt;&gt; But the word is in the bride, not as it was in Sarah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Brana is very specific. He takes Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Mary shows something that made her ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. To make her ready &gt;&gt; to be a part of the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think that's as brother Brennon would say, he said, he said, you understand? So it's not your mental attitude. It's not your mind that does it. &gt;&gt; But if you have a right kind of mental attitude to the one that has life, &gt;&gt; then he will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; So it's not, you understand, it's not your mind that does it. It's not your strong mind that does does it. &gt;&gt; So it's not mind over matter, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it's actually your right kind of mental attitude. &gt;&gt; And that's how simple it is. &gt;&gt; You understand? That's how simple it is. &gt;&gt; SO THAT PUBLICAN JUST SAID, "LORD, have mercy on me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that was all. and he went home justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we I think really let let me ponder a little bit on that because uh uh we will uh we really see how important and how simple and how how easy it is to be ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the rapture is the change of the body a promise? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a promise. So just maintain the right kind of mental attitude towards any promise &gt;&gt; then he will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we understand as we see a few uh uh sisters of the Bible we see and there we can see how attitude is actually very and why brother Brandham would really point out that the word and and don't forget it was in that time when the Holy Spirit told him pick up your pen and write. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a special time church. &gt;&gt; That was a special time. We come maybe a little later to that just to see that that it is really something that is a message going forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. To the church. So they understand who they are. &gt;&gt; And what is happening in them or with them &gt;&gt; and just they're okay. You know what Mary did? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we we we come a little later. We we don't want to run ahead of it. You know in the we have in the Bible we have the woman called Eve &gt;&gt; and it is evident that Eve was the right kind of womb and she received the wrong kind of seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the result was Cain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that you are the right kind of womb? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be very careful what you receive as a seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this is what you will bring forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman brought forth Cain and brought forth Abel. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Satan IS FIGHTING SO HARD TO GET YOU. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNOWS you are his only chance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND GOD KNOWS THAT YOU ARE HIS ONLY CHANCE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so the woman was the right womb, but she Eve, she was the right womb and she received the wrong seed. The result was Cain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we have another woman. in the Bible. Her name is Hagar. She was the wrong womb &gt;&gt; and the right seat. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There was a wrong womb and the right seat and the result was Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we have another woman. This is Sarah. This is amazing. She had a right womb and received the right seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what came forth was a man that could die. &gt;&gt; But then we have Mary. &gt;&gt; She was the right womb &gt;&gt; and surely she received the right seat. &gt;&gt; But that's not the end of the story. &gt;&gt; Watch the attitude Sarah had. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Watch the attitude Sarah had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And watch the attitude Mary had. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So it was actually the attitude of Mary. Do you know what attitude it was TOWARDS ANY PROMISE OF GOD? That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why she said to the angel and I trust we can say today to the sec to to to an angel not the same but to an angel that will give us that brought us a message it be to me according to your word. &gt;&gt; THAT ATTITUDE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT that right KIND OF ATTITUDE THAT he had that she had &gt;&gt; towards the promise &gt;&gt; then he brought it to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; She never created the egg. She never CREATED THE SEED. &gt;&gt; GOD DID. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; SO YOU WILL NOT CHANGE YOUR BODY. GOD will do. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We is it's so important that and I think this is something that will stay with us. So I would tell to be to be really ready for the change is to have the right kind of attitude &gt;&gt; towards any promise of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you if you read the message, read the Bible, you find what kind of things God HAS PROMISED. AND HOW MANY TIME how many time we develop a negative attitude &gt;&gt; towards God has promised &gt;&gt; because we think we are just a human being &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And you know as Mary as Sarah would say me an old woman, &gt;&gt; right? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; We an 2,000y old church. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we take the attitude we are just sinners saved by grace. &gt;&gt; When you are a sinner saved by grace, you are no sinner anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? Yes. But come on. When you are, do you believe you are saved? &gt;&gt; So when YOU ARE A SINNER SAVED BY GRACE, &gt;&gt; you're W. Here we go. YOU ARE NOT A SINNER saved by God's mercy. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; You're a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; GRACE GOES BACK TO PREDESTINATION. God saved you because he had a plan with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the capstone I'm running ahead of myself a little. Trust me, can get get that back, you know. THAT'S WHY THE CAPSTONE WOULD come down &gt;&gt; under the shouting GRACE GRACE WITH US. &gt;&gt; SO THERE WOULD BE A PEOPLE ON EARTH AS THE CAPSTONE IS COMING DOWN THAT WOULD SHOUT GRACE GRACE WITH US. THEY WOULD NOT CALL MERCY mercy &gt;&gt; because PAUL WOULD SAY PAUL would say I AM WHAT I am &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. You know what uh you know it's allow me to bring that quickly in. You know what grace actually is? Grace is an act of receiving unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; And allow me to say favor is never fair. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; God's favor is not fair. &gt;&gt; Because he's favoring you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So grace, grace is an act of receiving unmmerited unmmerited favor. And this happened in our day. You understand? We have to understand that we are what we are by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know that the whole Bible allow me to for a few minutes to go there because because I think this is so important as we as we speak of attitude. Hallelujah. As we speak of attitude that we understand all that is happening. All that we are all that will be the rapture the change of THE BODY IS JUST AN ACT OF GOD'S GRACE. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When God saved YOU HE NEVER FELT SORRY for you. That's right. God, &gt;&gt; he never felt pity for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Grace is not pity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet, HE IS STILL A God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But mercy is an act of of taking away deserved punishment. &gt;&gt; That's mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother Benham would say, he would say grace is as old as the earth is not mercy &gt;&gt; because grace goes back to the beginning. &gt;&gt; Oh, here we go. Grace, brother Ben said when when love is projected, &gt;&gt; GRACE COMES FORTH &gt;&gt; AND CAUSES the result. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why when brother Venom you understand in the garden of Eden as we really see uh uh uh the and the lamb was lain before the foundation of the world. Amen. The lamb was lain before the foundation of the world. When there before the foundation of the world THERE WERE NO SPACE for hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Hell was created for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; Right. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU UNDERSTAND that when the lamb was lame from before the foundation of the world, it was not because God felt pity that we ARE ON OUR WAY to hell. &gt;&gt; Because hell was not there before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope I trust trust we get that. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world, IT WAS JUST SLAIN BECAUSE GOD'S GRACE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAD A PLAN. THAT'S WHY WHEN ADAM AND EVE WAS IN THE GARDEN of Eden and they had fallen, HE CAME AROUND THE CORNER WITH a bloody skin. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD NEVER FELT PITY FOR ADAM AND HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS NOT AFRAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HELL. That's right. &gt;&gt; So all the the blood ALL THE BLOOD SHED WAS ACTUALLY AN ACT OF GRACE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT BLOOD WAS SHED, the skin WAS DONE SO THAT THEY WOULD MAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT they would come back. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand that? BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT we that we uh that we take and keep the right kind of attitude. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] You must have the right kind of attitude towards any promise. So if you if it comes to the BODY CHANGE, NEVER TRUST IN YOUR MERIT. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; you understand that? &gt;&gt; So because the the the CHANGE OF THE BODY IS AN ACT OF GOD'S GRACE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, so mercy or a grace is an act of receiving unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; My that's why when the capstone comes down, he comes down under the shouting grace grace WITH US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT attitude is there amongst the church that received the capstone. Don't you believe that this is the time that we're living in? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amenise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because head and body are united &gt;&gt; or are uniting. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is a uniting time in sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you understand and and even Jesus, my goodness, even Jesus himself, the Bible said he grew in grace and truth. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WEAPON TO OVERCOME &gt;&gt; WAS THAT HE UNDERSTOOD I AM WHAT I AM BY THE GRACE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Church church it's just that we keep the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Because for me this is one of the only things that keep that that that we that we are here for and and and that is that is remaining to find readiness is just having the right kind of attitude. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; I I think we can say praise the Lord RIGHT &gt;&gt; SO IF SOMEBODY is really rapture ready or ready for the change for sure he will have the right kind of attitude. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [clears throat] Amen. [snorts] Now, let's go to first Thessalonians just a little bit to uh to go and to see where we are at, you know, what what all has happened or what is all happening. Then we really also understand how far we are. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians, we we all know that scripture is very but but let me let me little bit expound on that and ju just keep in mind we will go later back to a few types of the Bible. Elijah will be one of them. And we want to really see of of characters in the Bible that were rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ready for translation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we might have our own thoughts. You know how many times I can see that people have their own thoughts what it means to be ready? &gt;&gt; Okay. When I reach this point, &gt;&gt; WHEN I REACH THIS POINT ON that letter to a statue of a perfect man, when I have added all the things. Okay, then &gt;&gt; how many years we have tried it? &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I find out many many uh get me right now when we getting older that's myself also you know many times we don't become more spiritual &gt;&gt; we forget more. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I never trust in what I know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I might lose that. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we as we as we go here, we we UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THE attitude is. &gt;&gt; And and and will be, you understand? And and and brother Venom was so plain. We understand how how the attitude was really the difference between Mary and Sarah. SO SARAH developed a neg you know why she developed a negative attitude because of the circumstances &gt;&gt; that's true &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and what kind of what kind of attitude do we have have we developed &gt;&gt; because of all the circumstances &gt;&gt; is that RIGHT THAT'S WHY SHE SAID YEAH COME ON DON'T MAKE A JOKE WITH ME I'M an old lady I and my husband having pleasure &gt;&gt; right [snorts] because of the age that she was living in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now she was not in Sodom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like we are not in Laia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we rub shoulders &gt;&gt; with Sodom and with Ludicia. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF Z THAT Sarah developed a negative attitude. And we must be very careful that this Satan's Eden is not implementing on us a certain picture what it means to be ready. &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What it means to be ready. &gt;&gt; Allow us really to UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BIBLE said what it needs to be ready. &gt;&gt; Is that right? WHAT THE PROPHET TELLS us what it needs to be ready. The brother Brandon would say your attitude actually presents you before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, is it isn't that isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; So, not what I achieve. &gt;&gt; Presents me before God. &gt;&gt; But my attitude. Is it not the prophet that said he said it is not so important what you really or for God it is important what you want to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not what you finally achieve. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Sarah Sarah she developed a negative attitude because of the of the loudian condition that she was sodom condition that she was living in. Again I want to say she was not in Sodom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like we are not in Lodicia but we rub shoulders with Lisia. &gt;&gt; We rub she rubbed shoulders with with with Sodom. And so she developed because of circumstances because of symptoms BECAUSE OF AGE BECAUSE OF INABILITY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; Never develop a negative attitude because of your inability. Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS NOT LOOKING WHAT YOU ARE ABLE OF TO DO. GOD IS looking for what you want. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT attitude is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we will find that a little later really in the Bible. Now let's let's read uh e really actually that we see where we are at you know and and and and trustfully um we can say the prophet would say the only thing that I can see is still missing is the readiness of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I must be honest with you for me the bride is ready. Otherwise, what must happen to make us ready? &gt;&gt; What do we expect? &gt;&gt; What do we expect that helps us to be ready? &gt;&gt; What kind of precious squeeze we think must come? &gt;&gt; The prophet said squeeze will bring you nothing. &gt;&gt; That's what he also said. &gt;&gt; Mhm. So what do we expect that helps us to make us ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe if you are sitting here with the right kind of attitude, &gt;&gt; towards the promise of God, &gt;&gt; you are ready. &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS of your circumstances, &gt;&gt; regardless of your ability, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, it's it's very simple. &gt;&gt; Why would we WHY WOULD WE TRY TO DO THE MAGIC? &gt;&gt; When it's so simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID WHAT DID MARY DO MAGIC? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To that the life that she became actually the life house of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU SHE JUST said &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; TO THE MESSAGE OF THE ANGEL. &gt;&gt; AND SHE REMEMBER DON'T FORGET HOW THAT message started. &gt;&gt; The angel CAME DOWN AND BEFORE HE TOLD her &gt;&gt; the message he said MARY I WANT YOU TO understand what is happening to you now. It's God's grace. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; DID THE ANGEL NOT SAY &gt;&gt; YOU ARE YOU ARE HIGHLY FAVORED AMONGST &gt;&gt; HIGHLY FAVORED MEANS YOU FOUND GRACE. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY AGAIN NOT MERCY BUT GRACE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GRACE GOES BACK TO PREDESTINATION. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SAVED YOU, I'M SAVED BY GRACE. NOT BECAUSE GOD FELT PITY FOR ME. &gt;&gt; HE SAVED ME BECAUSE HE LOVED ME. IS THAT RIGHT? HE SAVED ME BECAUSE HE HAD A PURPOSE FOR ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let me say that again. &gt;&gt; And I trust we can understand that proper because I think sometimes it's so important that that we that we really understand what happened in our day. That's why brother Adam called it it's the message of grace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He never said it's a message of mercy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is a message of God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it right? BECAUSE REMEMBER IN THE GARDEN of Eden when the lamb was shed, it was shed for Adam and God was clothing him with that lamb skinin. &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE GOD FELT PITY THAT ADAM WAS ON HIS WAY to hell. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HELL IS NOT CREATED FOR ADAM AND HIS RACE. &gt;&gt; HELL IS CREATED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? SO WHEN GOD SAVED YOU AND YOU CAN SAY I'M SAVED BY GRACE, THEN YOU ARE NOT SAY THAT'S WHY WHEN GOD IS NOT FEELING PITY for us, &gt;&gt; we should not feel pity for ourselves. &gt;&gt; And Sarah FELT PITY FOR HERSELF. POOR ME. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THAT POOR ME, SHE DEVELOPED a negative attitude. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen church. It will be very simple to be changed. &gt;&gt; It will be as the prophet would say. I believe it will be just a daily routine. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I'M NOT WAITING FOR THE CHANGE. I am the change. THE RAPTURE IS NOT COMING TO ME. I'M A PART OF IT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just keep regardless of the circumstances, regardless of the stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. YOU KNOW WHY GOD ALLOWS this stuff? Why he allows the stuff around us in circumstances? JUST TO PROVE YES. Come on, CHURCH. JUST TO PROVE TO SATAN THAT THIS BRIDE IS DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; SO IT NEEDED WHOLE HELL &gt;&gt; to prove who you are. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let let's read. For the Bible said, we we we we want to really look at this. For the for the Lord himself, first Thessalonians 4:16, for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel, and with a trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So we understand what so so certain things has to happen for the dead in Christ to rise. We understand this is actually something that is can I say in process. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But the dead in Christ will rise. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You know why THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL RISE? because they will hear the voice of the resurrection &gt;&gt; AND THE TRUMP OF GOD SHALL SOUND. &gt;&gt; AND I JUST WANT YOU and and and AS WE GO ON AND I TRUST YOU KEEP THE right kind of attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and not not uh not LOOK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE circumstances that you are in and that you are around because the circumstances that God [laughter] that God allowed in your life IS ONLY THAT YOU CAN PROVE THAT YOU ARE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HOW IS GOD PROVING THAT THIS Eve is different than the other one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. stuff &gt;&gt; circumstances. &gt;&gt; She's not putting a He's not putting a crown on her and said, "No, this is my bride. She's better than the first one." &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; HE IS ALLOWING THE GREATEST TEMPTATION TO COME TO YOU &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WANT TO PROVE HIS, YOU UNDERSTAND, I mean [laughter] his his accountant or how you call it is on stake. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because he made the statement. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He made the statement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That this bride is different than the first one. &gt;&gt; You know that it was God's statement. It was not so much Yope speaking of himself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS ACTUALLY God &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; telling to Satan &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; that there's someone on earth that is perfect. Is that right? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD IS SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT YOU, HE IS RESPONSIBLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That it happens. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And Job was here on earth. HE DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THAT OH, CHURCH. YES. We see the whole story of Job &gt;&gt; and and and the whole story of Job. All of his settings &gt;&gt; starts with him being perfect. &gt;&gt; Did you ever thought of it? &gt;&gt; Go to Job one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There the Bible said little later in Job I think 18 God repeats it to Satan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He said, "Hey, have you looked to my servant Job?" Amen. &gt;&gt; So the whole story of Job and I want you really to and and and we have the prophet for that. &gt;&gt; The whole Jo story of Job starts when he is perfect. &gt;&gt; Not flawless. &gt;&gt; Not without mistakes. &gt;&gt; No. I mean THIS IS THE GUY GOD SAID HE'S PERFECT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? CURSED BE THE DAY THAT I was born. That's right. &gt;&gt; SO, HE HAD HIS BAD DAYS. IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID ALREADY HE'S PERFECT. &gt;&gt; And God cannot change his mind about his word. &gt;&gt; You You understand that? SO THAT SHOWS EXACTLY REGARDLESS OF WHAT STUFF, REGARDLESS SOMETIMES HOW YOU HOW YOUR EMOTIONS BETRAY YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You're still ready. Can we say praise THE LORD? &gt;&gt; SO JUST KEEP THE RIGHT attitude &gt;&gt; towards what God is saying about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or well, it's easy for me when when I can believe that I'm a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; But what about when God tells you, "I saved you for a purpose. How is our attitude then? &gt;&gt; Sarah developed a negative attitude. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Such a negative attitude. When Elohim came to her, Abraham came to her or Elohim came to her in this second visit. She had developed such a negative attitude because of all the circumstances, all this stuff. AND YET GOD ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN TO PROVE THAT HE'S still God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and and and Charlie before before we go on remember when e all the things when it comes to job it's the oldest book in the Bible &gt;&gt; is that right &gt;&gt; amen it's the oldest book in the Bible &gt;&gt; and the whole story of Job starts with him being perfect &gt;&gt; so all the things that happened to Yope come on &gt;&gt; are we are Are you awake? &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Not one of the things that happened to Job was to chastise him [snorts] &gt;&gt; only to prove him." [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you understand? So nothing really that happened to you. Brother, you have a quote for it, brother. I'm said that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why? BECAUSE GOD DIDN'T NEED TO CHASTISE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS PERFECT. &gt;&gt; By the way, when we come TO CHASTISEMENT, THE BIBLE PAUL WOULD SAY it's only for a few days. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Like in our earthly home, WE JUST CHASTISE our children only for a few days. My son is now 30 years old. Don't ask me to chastise him now. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; COME ON. SO CHASTISEMENT ANYHOW IS ONLY OF A few days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And in the in the in the time of come on in the time OF JOB NOTHING THAT HAPPENS TO JOB HERE TO HERE WE ARE STANDING &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE DECLARED BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR PERFECT. &gt;&gt; You know why? BECAUSE AN PERFECT GOD will not marry an imperfect woman. AND THE FACT THAT HE'S ASKING YOU TO MARRY HIM SHOWS WHO YOU ARE in his sight. &gt;&gt; What attitude do we have &gt;&gt; towards that? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What attitude do we have &gt;&gt; towards that what God tells us? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sarah said me. No, I'm too old. &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe you say I'm too young. &gt;&gt; How many times I hear that? Well, this of the message is for the young people. I said, stop that. Never. Young people, never say you're too young for it. &gt;&gt; Because we will have babies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Walk in a body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't tell me you're too young. &gt;&gt; JUST KEEP THE RIGHT kind of attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT, IF IT'S TOO MUCH FOR YOU, say thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you think Mary has understood THAT? WHAT GO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER? She said, "My goodness." I mean, this is really how and the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; You understand? Yeah, &gt;&gt; come on church. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE ANSWER OF THE ANGEL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For me, it would raise even more questions. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW, NOW SHE HAD THE RIGHT ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY?

It is also written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; SO, SATAN WAS BRINGING THE TRUTH to him, not in love. Don't forget when love is projected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we have to we have to get somewhere. But but you understand with Job, we have to last time I left you, I think a little bit we wanted to talk about Moses and Moses and we never came to Moses. &gt;&gt; So, forgive me.

I mean, he became really low. &gt;&gt; HOW LOW CAN YOU BECOME TO SAY, "CURSE ME THE DAY THAT I was born." &gt;&gt; And God calls you perfect, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; And brother Brenon would say, and I'm so happy he said it. That's why I can say it. He said, "Nothing that happened to Job was to chastise them, only to prove him." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Church, [snorts] to a perfect bride of Christ, ALL THIS STUFF THAT IS happening is [clears throat] only to prove who you are. &gt;&gt; Because don't tell me that the bridegroom has to chastise his bride. &gt;&gt; No. No. Don't take that attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And there's where you have to meet the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother said when the church can discern the working of the TWO SPIRITS &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WITHIN THEMSSELF. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So when SATAN THROWS THE TRUTH AT ME &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; and the truth MAKES ME DEPRESSED, I SAY, "SATAN, get behind me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. IT'S HIGH TIME, CHURCH, THAT WE believe what God spoke about us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; IT WAS HIGH TIME GOD WAS SO UPSET WITH JOB BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T believe what God spoke about him. &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU COME TO ME WITH SUCH A THING? I DECLARED YOU PERFECT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Who feels perfect? Okay, good news. That's not the requirement of being ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm ready if I feel good. I'm ready if I don't feel good. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's let's let's uh read quickly first Thessalonians as as we have as we have uh as we have had that you know as we said and the Lord himself the Lord himself shall come down. Amen. Allow me to little bit expand on that that we really can see where we are standing &gt;&gt; and what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then keeping our attitude. &gt;&gt; I wonder that if the end of the service we still can say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But this is the right kind of attitude. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, again, the angel said, "The Holy Spirit to Mary, the Holy Spirit will overshadow you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mary was, you know, in what kind of situation the angel came in a very, very difficult situation. Now, God, allow me to say that God could have done it much easier. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because God waited till Mary and Joseph were engaged. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, he could have done much better. Sorry when I say that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because this IS SOMETIMES WHAT WE FEEL. OH, THINGS COULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER. NO, GOD NEED THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES TO prove &gt;&gt; who you are. &gt;&gt; You know that he needs he needed to allow that the pit became open. &gt;&gt; He needed hell on earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To show who you are. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you understand he was marry and Joseph situation was very I mean JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER would be much better. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But now she was engaged. &gt;&gt; You understand how difficult that was now? &gt;&gt; Because in Israel there was a law. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When somebody was engaged that was different than when somebody was a lone virgin. &gt;&gt; But now she was NOT ONLY A VIRGIN but she was an engaged virgin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you understand. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If that virgin, if she is engaged, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. and she IS NOT CRYING. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She has to be stoned. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's a different law when she is just a virgin. &gt;&gt; But God waited till it became really complicated. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Ah, God waited to bring you here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You waited. YOU NEVER WAS THERE WHEN THE PROPHET was there. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because he had to bring you there when it is really complicated. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise God. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Lordise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, &gt;&gt; just keep the right kind of attitude &gt;&gt; towards any promise of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. 1 Thessalonians uh 1 Thessalonians 4. Let us quickly read as and then we want to really see a little you know what the prophet said already how he identified it with his own ministry. [snorts] For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we who are still alive and remain shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And we had a prophet We had a prophet that could say that the the shout is the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The shout is the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then brother Bam said, "The voice of the archangel is always Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Is always Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And I trust you understand how much you are involved with it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the angel came to Mary to tell her you are involved. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This angel came to us to tell us &gt;&gt; we are involved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now what kind of attitude? &gt;&gt; That's right. you would have taught that &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt; don't play humble now. &gt;&gt; Don't play religious. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Let us face what God said. &gt;&gt; You know Mary never said I think when I look to my past when I look to my parents when I look to I think this is not a good choice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't know what went on in her head, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, all kinds of stuff BECAUSE SHE HAD STUFF IN HER FAMILY. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THERE WAS STUFF AROUND JOSEPH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; You know that Joseph was a man that was married before. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; According to the prophet, he was a man. He had four children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, ALL KIND OF STUFF THAT WAS GOING ON. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Yes, &gt;&gt; we think it was just a lovely world around Mary, you know, everything from glory to glory. No, she was in stuff. &gt;&gt; She was in circumstances. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY JOSEPH WAS NOT SO HAPPY WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED. [laughter] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WHEN JOSEPH HEARD THAT MESSAGE AND AND MARY CAME TO HIM AND SAID, "HONEY, CAN I tell you something? I'm pregnant." &gt;&gt; Joseph never said, "PRAISE THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. [laughter] He said, "Who is the guy? Who's the man?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, NO, JOSEPH. NO MAN, NO MAN. THE HOLY SPIRIT OVERSHADOW ME. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME IT EVER HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME IT EVER HAPPENS IS NOW. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOU HAPPENED TO NOBODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No, this what happening to the bride is special. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has has has used the best thing for the end. &gt;&gt; Is that right? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother Venom would let us know. Let me let me let me quickly read to you church age book and we [clears throat] will really it's it's really amazing why the prophet said the word is in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's just so beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now let let me let me let me let us quickly see that voice of the archangel. Now not not to make any doctrinal point and say this is this just relax enjoy &gt;&gt; you know I I I found out sometimes people get very scared when you touch do you want to say that now let's face it &gt;&gt; because the voice of the archangel is always CHRIST &gt;&gt; BUT CHRIST is not alone &gt;&gt; that's RIGHT &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY ADAM WAS given and helpmate Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to wash his clothes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to iron his shirts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They didn't need because they were naked. &gt;&gt; You understand? SO WHEN GOD SAID, "I this comes after the fall." You understand that? But church, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The connection that Christ has to the bride goes back as it was before the fall. Yes, &gt;&gt; I believe this glory will finally change our bodies. &gt;&gt; That's why IT WILL BE A DAILY ROUTINE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU TRY TO FORCE YOURSELF INTO. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU PRAY YOURSELF INTO. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Something that happens to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? &gt;&gt; The prophet said it will be just a daily routine being in the scriptures and in the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Ask, did you ever thought the first Adam why he was given a helpmate? &gt;&gt; Then you understand why the second Adam, &gt;&gt; Christ, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; the archangel, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; needs a helpmate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S WHY THE MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE THERE IN EDEN. YOU KNOW WHY? Because God was joining them together again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR A PURPOSE. And we understand if the fall would not have happened, they would have brought forth Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; IS THAT CORRECT? NOT BY SEX, NOT BY BIRTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And you understand what God is doing. Are we living in the time when when the the prophet speaks of an invisible union of the bride of Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Is an invisible taking place. &gt;&gt; So God is not uniting to just his spouse. &gt;&gt; God is uniting with his wife. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's really look. Let's really look. Let's really see [sighs] who was responsible for Eve. &gt;&gt; Not Adam. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, God made it very plain. He put Adam in a deep sleep. &gt;&gt; Amazing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who was interested in Christ having a bride? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not Christ. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; No. That's why Robin said God put him to sleep &gt;&gt; at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know why? BECAUSE THIS IS GOD'S BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Is it not amazing &gt;&gt; how it was not Isaac hunting for a bride? &gt;&gt; It was Abraham. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY?

He just brings it in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The nobody nobody knew that Romeo was around &gt;&gt; because he came secret. &gt;&gt; He came as a thief in the night. &gt;&gt; Is that right? THAT IS EXACTLY NOT WHAT he's coming for. &gt;&gt; He's not a thief, BUT HE COMES AS A THIEF. WHAT IS A GOOD THIEF DOING? A good thief when he comes to your house, he doesn't steal what everybody can buy. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; HE STEALS THE MOST VALUABLE thing you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THAT HE COMES AS EVE, WHO HE'S HE'S COMING TO STEAL THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And remember, nobody nobody was aware that Romeo was present. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. No. Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; ONLY THE WATCHMAN IN THE TOWER, he could tell us. Is that right? Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; ONLY THE WATCHMAN IN THE TOWER, HE COULD TELL US, "MY MINISTRY IS TO DECLARE unto you that he is here now." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram, WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE? BROTHER COULD SAY HE lives in me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With other words, I am he. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? The only proof that Romeo was present was when Julia was gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the only proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet could say this second coming is a bright coming &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But but but but but really stay with me for for a couple of couple of minutes because now that the trump the trump of God I think it's so it's let let me the trump of God and allow me to say that only to make it clear. Yes, it's not the trump of Christ. &gt;&gt; It's a trump of God. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we understand that it was God always responsible for the woman. &gt;&gt; God was responsible. &gt;&gt; Not Adam. &gt;&gt; God was responsible for you being here. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. So has God loved the world &gt;&gt; that he gave his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the scriptures that we all but what kind of world God is loving. &gt;&gt; When John is telling a little bit later, if you love the world and the things of the world, the love of God is not in you. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT WORLD GOD LOVES? WHY DID GOD GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON? because of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD NEEDS YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; SO IT IS THE TRUMP OF GOD SHALL SOUND. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's so beautiful, church. If you want to understand the Bible types, it becomes so easy and so so simple. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing that a king was making marriage for his son? &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; A king was making marriage, &gt;&gt; not the son was making marriage for him. &gt;&gt; And it was a king, YOU KNOW, GETTING UP GET PEOPLE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; For the wedding, right? IT WAS A KING THAT WAS UPSET WHEN NOBODY WANTED to come. That's right. &gt;&gt; I, as a father, would be happy because it's cheaper wedding. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THE FATHER WAS UPSET. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? THE FATHER WAS UPSET THAT SOMEBODY REFUSES TO COME TO THE WEDDING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts] Go to Matthew 22. &gt;&gt; Find me the bride there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Find me the bride in this parable. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? You know why he's inviting? Because he needs a bride. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Finally, you know what? He invites bad and good. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Never develop the attitude, I'm better than the other one. &gt;&gt; No. You are chosen by grace. &gt;&gt; Grace, it's an unmmerited favor. And favor is not fair. &gt;&gt; Ah, come on church. No, that favor is not fair. &gt;&gt; Jacob and Eso, you speak of fair. &gt;&gt; BEFORE THEY WERE BORN, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You understand how easy it becomes? &gt;&gt; Hey, my goodness, church. &gt;&gt; We could sit here just walking into a body change. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will be one day, church. It will be one day. If it is not now, then maybe tomorrow. Maybe in 10 years, maybe in 20 years. I don't care how long it takes. &gt;&gt; If he keeps us longer on earth, he has more to show off himself, &gt;&gt; right? That's his choice, &gt;&gt; that's his choice, &gt;&gt; even if he feels we change A LITTLE BIT THE PROGRAM, we leave it a little bit longer. IT'S BECAUSE HE WANT TO SHOW MORE OF HIMSELF. AND WE WHEN HE HAS A BRIDE ON EARTH THAT HE CAN USE, HE'S HAPPY TO SHOW MORE OF HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Let me read quickly to you. [snorts] Brother Ram said, "Look, if there's a whole bunch of trumpets laying here and one of them had a sound of a certain music, it is the man them trumpets are perfectly mute." [clears throat] Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It is the fellow that can sound the trumpet. &gt;&gt; That knows what he is going to do. &gt;&gt; You know who sounds the trumpet? &gt;&gt; It's a trump of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But Christ sounds the trumpet. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And that Christ is here. How can I be a trump? &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a trumpet never tries to play itself. &gt;&gt; Is it correct? &gt;&gt; Very simple. It cannot. &gt;&gt; So don't try to do. You cannot. &gt;&gt; You only make a fool out of yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The trumpet has nothing to do with it. The sound comes from an intelligence behind it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sorry when I get get upset emotional. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The prophet said the last thing that comes to the church is the intelligence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And do you believe the intelligence is here? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how is intelligence been proven? Well, if you are stupid or clever, you prove it with your body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, how is intelligence proven? &gt;&gt; It's not wavering to the room. And &gt;&gt; it's proven in you and me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. [snorts] All men are the same. All Christians are the same. There's no great men amongst us. We are not great men nor great women. We are all brothers and sisters. All the same in the same bracket. We There's no great one doesn't make one greater than the other. Not one thing. We are just human beings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we can just stay in that attitude. &gt;&gt; That's right. and allow the master &gt;&gt; to play. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Allow the master to play [snorts] &gt;&gt; now. Shout voice and trump and then the dead in Christ shall rise. Where are we standing church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are we standing? Is that right? Where are we standing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. [snorts] Now we can say I would allow me allow me to to do that. That was the seventh seal by the way about the trumpets to really see that the trumpet has nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; It's the trump of God. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Is it Is it okay? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because it says the trump of God, not the trump of Christ. IT WAS ALWAYS GOD interested in getting Adam a wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Christ a bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was always the father. You know why? &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us. It was the unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I trust you understand that &gt;&gt; this is what we are in is the unveiling of God. YEAH, &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD IS CHOOSING A BRIDE FOR CHRIST &gt;&gt; to that's why Abraham &gt;&gt; was so anxious to get a wife for Isaac and he told Eleazar don't get to that place only go to a certain place &gt;&gt; isn't it amazing &gt;&gt; so it was not Isaac saying you know Eleazar take care don't go to you know no it was Abraham &gt;&gt; but it was not his wife &gt;&gt; RIGHT &gt;&gt; BUT ABRAHAM KNEW EVERYTHING THAT ISAAC BRING FORTH IS AN expression further expression of me. &gt;&gt; OH, EVERYTHING THAT CHRIST WILL BRING FORTH IS AN EXPRESSION OF GOD. &gt;&gt; This is the unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; You are &gt;&gt; the unveiling of God. church. No wonder &gt;&gt; brother Brennan would say desperation. Let me read that to you. And now the entire Holy Ghost visits the church making God in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Just sing only believe all things are possible. THAT'S WHY THE ANGEL OF THE LORD LIKED THAT SONG. YOU KNOW WHY? &gt;&gt; This is what he wants to hear from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's possible. That's possible with me. &gt;&gt; That's possible with me. IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. [sighs] &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Who really is the messenger to the final age? &gt;&gt; I have a little I have a little uh brother um can you can you bring up the the the I thought it it might be a little help to really understand what happened in our day and when the prophet is saying she will be under her messenger what he is really talking about Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] This is actually uh uh takes a while to get used to it. But uh you understand this is the church ages from Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergam, Taratara, Zadis, Philadelphia, and Ludicia. And then there is the messengers from Paul, Arinius, Martin, Columbus, Luther, Wesley and uh brother Brham, right? And then we have there uh the years from from zero I I brought it zero to 2023 right we are further than that but 2023 uh Ephesus and Leoia was at the same time span right &gt;&gt; yeah it was 2023 you know normally we used to say uh brother said uh uh ludicial will be a very short age he actually not say the shortest He said a very short one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So from 2023, Laudisia is not the shortest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But Ephesus is right. &gt;&gt; Okay. That's why I only took to 2023 just for clearance. Then you have the years of the church ages, how long they were 117 and so on and so on. 119 117 and so and so on. And uh the messengers also behind the messengers I have put the age. how old they became. And this is all uh historical. You can just go ahead and look it up for yourself. So this you don't need to be very spiritual for that. It's just very simple. Okay. But what is very amazing, you know, I I I I used to just take it for granted that I knew that the the messenger always comes at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; Everybody agrees? Everybody is familiar with that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I I say that also to un to to to really to recognize that we have spiritual people sometimes in the church [snorts] was once I preached that just normal. I quoted the prophet so many times. He said, "And the messenger always comes at the end of the age." And this was I had a sister coming to me out of my church. She said, "Brother Andrew, do you know that the messenger comes always at the end of the former age?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I said to her, "Sister, that must be the truth." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's &gt;&gt; okay. So, and I've written it down. It takes a while, but uh it's not so important that we get everything. Paul, when did Paul came on the scene? He was a messenger to the Ephesian churches. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But he never came at the end of Ephesus. &gt;&gt; Can I read to you few statements of the prophet? It helped me. It helped me really much to uh I give you only two or three. Um it's in the first seal. He said we first seal page 114. We found in studying of the scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age. Every time Paul came at the end of the age. We find out that Arremius came at the end of the age. Martin at the end. Lut came at the end of the Catholic age. That the first time he's more precise first of the Catholic age. WESLEY AT THE END OF the Lutheran age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE SAID AND PENTECOST AT THE END OF THE AGE OF SANCTIFICATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh, brother said further in the in the message countdown, I just I just want to read you the quotes because I think it's it's good to know that they are there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because it it's quite quite amazing and I think also important that we understand under what kind of messenger &gt;&gt; we will become the voice. &gt;&gt; Right. You know, if Christ wouldn't have come down in this age, we could never be the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because always Christ is the voice of the archangel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Brother Random was not the voice of the archangel. Yeah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And remember this is out of countdown. Remember the messenger comes at the end of the former message always. &gt;&gt; The messenger comes at the end of the former message. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Always. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just only to make it even more plain, &gt;&gt; brother Random said Paul came at the end of Judaism. &gt;&gt; You can type that in. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Paul didn't came at the end of Ephesus. Actually, Paul died at at 10. Can I say AD? At 10. And he died 67. His church age started in 53 and ended in 170. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Okay, go with me. It's it's quite nice. Now, Ireneius was not born at the or came not to the church age or to the to to the world, let's say, at the end of Smyrna, but at the end of Ephesus. &gt;&gt; So, always the prophet comes at the end of the former. That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Something that will that shook me off my chair when I saw that. &gt;&gt; It really I was as I was looking at it I'm a German and you normally I know how to behave myself. &gt;&gt; But when I saw that I'm happy nobody was around. &gt;&gt; I said that that's that really it it shocked me. I must be honest. &gt;&gt; Go a little further. We then go we go we go. Martin came at the end of Smyrna, right? Cola, keep your breath. Columba came at the end of Paragamon. So Cola was born in 529, died at 5 97. His church age started according to what the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; gave his Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His church age started 606. &gt;&gt; That means Cola lived not one day &gt;&gt; in the church age that he was a messenger to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can you can go in history, you can find out. To me, it was it JUST MADE THAT TYPE SO CLEAR. YES. &gt;&gt; So when did the messenger [snorts] you understand it's sometimes very we speak of the Pentecostal age. You know how many times brother Brandon would say we have the western age the Lutan age and the Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; You know why he did that? Because he couldn't say Brham age. &gt;&gt; It's very simple. &gt;&gt; He said Lutheran vessel but he couldn't say Brham. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why he said Pentecostal age. Right. &gt;&gt; You with me? Speaking of the Laudisian church age, is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Yes. [snorts] And so we we understand we understand. Now, now let's go on. Let's Luther. Luther came not at the end of Zadis, &gt;&gt; but he came at the end of Tayotara. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Of the long Catholic age, brother called it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He came at the end of that. Luther came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Vestam said came at the end of Lutheran age. He said, "And Pentecost with other words, the messenger to the seven church age, William Brham, came not at the end of Ludicia, &gt;&gt; but came at the end of Philadelphia." &gt;&gt; That's why most Pentecostal movements have William Brham as their founder. &gt;&gt; Right? You can look in &gt;&gt; in historical things. Most Pentecostal movements have William Brham as the founder. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, who is the one that comes at the end of Lisia &gt;&gt; that brother spoke of? &gt;&gt; No wonder it's not an eight messenger. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; No, no. It's not somebody from Germany or somebody from the States or whatever. Whatever. Whatever. &gt;&gt; As I SAID, THE ARCHANGEL ALWAYS IS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I think we are too old for that. Right. &gt;&gt; We are too old. This happened too many times that somebody is the eight messenger and &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; poof nothing came out of it. &gt;&gt; So you understand? So when brother Adam SPEAK YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT BECAME BECAUSE WILLIAM BRANDHAM HAD TO DO WITH that &gt;&gt; because William Brham it WAS NOT LIKE JOHN THE BAPTIST THAT ONLY HAD ONE MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAN DIDN'T HAD ONLY THE MINISTRY OF THE FORERUNNER. He did not only had the MINISTRY OF THE CHURCH MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; He didn't ONLY HAD THE MINISTRY OF MOSES. HE ALSO HAD THE MINISTRY of &gt;&gt; Joshua. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; No wonder Raanam said two of us cannot be at the same time. If that is RIGHT THAT HE IS HERE, &gt;&gt; then I must decrease and he must increase. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? From from whom he was speaking, he's speaking of Christ. &gt;&gt; HE'S SPEAKING OF THE ARCHANGEL. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN BROTHER ADAM LEFT THE SCENE, CHRIST DID NOT LEAVE THE SCENE. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we understand then it was brother Ranom actually he was the one who called it. Allow me to read that to you &gt;&gt; only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know I say many times people I'm not guilty of that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I would never use that word bride age unless brother Venom would have brought it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] He said, "We are not living in the Pentecostal age." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; We are not living in a Pentecostal age. We are living in another age. See, we're not living in the Methodist age. We're living in another age. We are living up here to the bride age. The calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture. That's the age that we are now living. To my honest opinion, that's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's very e it's very simple actually. It's like goan in Egypt. &gt;&gt; I mean we are still living in ludicia, right? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; We are still living in Laisia. &gt;&gt; But don't live in Lisia. &gt;&gt; I'm still in Loisia like Abraham. Abraham was not in Sodom but he lived under Sodom. Under Sodom conditions 100%. And his WIFE WAS INFLUENCED. COME ON CHURCH. HIS WIFE WAS INFLUENCED. THAT'S WHY HER ATTITUDE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE INFLUENCED by the loudian. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; Loudia means people's rights. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see how how another line just opens, right? &gt;&gt; I trust you're not upset that we don't take that line. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. So So hey, come on, church. No, it is not wrong [snorts] that somebody told the prophet, "Pick up the pen and write." It is right. &gt;&gt; It was the same one telling to the seventh angel to the messenger of Laudisia. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And who was the messenger to the seven church age? To the seven church age. William Brham. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you can understand there's a change. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; There's a change going on. &gt;&gt; Because when you who is declaring the message to the church age, the messenger. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He is actually because it said in the Bible to the messenger of Lou is right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that writing he should read &gt;&gt; to the church age. &gt;&gt; Right. And you know what IT WAS TO THE CHURCH AGE? FULL OF COMPLAIN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You read it. Come on. &gt;&gt; You read the letter that is to the church age WRITTEN OR SPOKEN BY THE now we understand. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We understand sometimes statements brother Brennan is doing that has nothing to do with the bride. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on church. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because he WAS ALSO THE MESSENGER TO &gt;&gt; Louia &gt;&gt; and read it. We don't have the time to read it as we can revelation 3:14 how it is there. I have against thee. YEAH. YOU WHAT IT SAID. &gt;&gt; But what happened one day, brother said, I was just there and the Holy Spirit told me, pick up your pen and write. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [sighs] &gt;&gt; That was not a message to &gt;&gt; Loudicia. &gt;&gt; Right. No, sure not. &gt;&gt; But that was a message &gt;&gt; to the brides. &gt;&gt; Allow me to say in the bride age. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not another age. We understand that. It's no no no. &gt;&gt; But is it not simple? &gt;&gt; Amen. IN EGYPT BEFORE THE EXODUS, they had a place called Goan &gt;&gt; where they could go and live. And in Goan, it was light. In Egypt, IT WAS LIGHT. AT DAY TIME, THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK IN EGYPT. At evening time, THEY WOULD COME BACK TO GOAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's not really another age, but it's ANOTHER PHASE. &gt;&gt; AND I CANNOT CHANGE IT BECAUSE GOD SAID TO THE PROPHET, PICK UP YOUR PEN AND WRITE. [cheering] IN that letter, he's telling us the word is in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; SO, THAT MEANS THE ONLY THING FOR YOUR BODY, come on, FOR YOUR BODY TO CHANGE is to keep the right kind OF ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANYTHING THAT GOD is saying about you. Yeah. [panting] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's And I I want to ask you again, are you rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who feels rapture ready now? &gt;&gt; A little bit more, right? &gt;&gt; And then brother Random would say, "Christ, give give me Yeah, I know it's late. Sorry." Um then brother Ram said Christ the mystery of God revealed such an amazing statement and as as I said we just went at home with the church through the to the the great how the great how brother Ranom said in Christ the mystery of God revealed. He said the great mystery of how is still a secret. Amen. &gt;&gt; At the end of the sermon said that secret is not revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said then he goes further. He said he doesn't has not showed because when they asked Jesus when it will be they never asked Jesus how it will come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Remember &gt;&gt; they asked Jesus when it will come. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said not even the son knoweth [clears throat] the hour. Right. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, brother Wam said the how and the when is still a secret. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And you know how many confusion came up when the when was touched. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. [laughter] &gt;&gt; WHEN BROTHER ADAM TOUCHED THE WHEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; 1977. &gt;&gt; So he was there to touch the how. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; That's right. He was he has because IF SATAN KNOWS THE how &gt;&gt; he would cause a great confusion. &gt;&gt; Very simple. &gt;&gt; It's the how. It's the attitude. &gt;&gt; It's the how you do things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Um and in that message, brother Ram said, "No, the how is a secret. Nobody knows." He said, "No, he has showed and revealed it &gt;&gt; in every type of the Bible." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, I'm from Germany. I'm not so clever. So I said, "If the rapture, the how is a secret, I want to see in the Bible of the characters how the how worked." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And I'm so glad the prophet said there were three raptures in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And three raptures in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; We are number five, &gt;&gt; right? Is that okay? &gt;&gt; And he said he has shown it in the types of the and ALL THE LIFE OF THE believers in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Unveil that great mystery of how. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; So as simple as I am, I said okay &gt;&gt; let's look to Enoch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's look to Enoch. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. He was he was brother said he was right. Seemingly he reached a point and he had before his translation he had that testimony &gt;&gt; that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT FAITH it's impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; AND AS WE SAID in the beginning it is your daily routine. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH. &gt;&gt; IT IS your daily routine. &gt;&gt; How many times we miss that simplicity of perfect faith? Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect faith. I always say when you are when you are when you are healed, you need a special faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you're not healed, &gt;&gt; you need more faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; How many people How many people they go off because God doesn't heal them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, when your healing doesn't come to you quick, you need faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. Abraham by faith. We couldn't go in in in chapter 11 of Hebrews. It's funny what happens by or interesting what happens by faith. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BY FAITH they were cut into pieces. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; Sarah. By faith. &gt;&gt; Okay, we leave that there. Amen. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we understand as we have all those types quickly quickly because we want to run those types. It's very amazing because as we see those characters in the Bible now and we really see they made it already right &gt;&gt; they walked into their translation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] And their life tells a story. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's a little bit look at the life of them and to see what it means to be rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; First, I think first we don't stay too long with Enoch because it will take another two hours to stay with Enoch because he was just a special man. But Enoch had the same trouble that I had. He said, "How do you know? Because he's the type." &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He was the seventh from Adam. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We are the seventh from the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ME happened to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Enoch and and Yeah. Enoch in that in his fallen stage came to a place that he pleased God &gt;&gt; before his translation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a sinner. HE WAS BORN IN SIN. &gt;&gt; And I wanted even to say the blood of Jesus Christ was not shed at that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. What can we do today &gt;&gt; after the blood is shed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE STANDING? &gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE NOT A LITTLE church mouse. &gt;&gt; Who told you that you are a grasshopper? &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ISRAEL SAID WE ARE GRASSHOPPERS. WHO TOLD YOU? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He He said TO HE TELLS WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE NAKED? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Well, surely Enoch was a was a interesting man. &gt;&gt; Very interesting man. &gt;&gt; As you are. &gt;&gt; You know that you are special. &gt;&gt; You know why you are special? Because he chose you. &gt;&gt; That's why you are special. &gt;&gt; Not because you come from Ohio. Not because you come from this church or I come from Germany or or I'm white or I'm black or whatever whatever. So we are we are of value because he chose us. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's it's very interesting with Enoch. It's very interesting with Enoch. The Bible tells us that all of his days were 365 years. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. This is now you always must remember um who wrote that? Who wrote that? It was not Enoch. Enoch was not writing about himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said not I was that age and &gt;&gt; No, it was Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who came how many years later? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think Moses came about 1,000 or more years later. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To write Genesis. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. No. Moses was not there when it happened. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God could Yeah. He, you know, he wasn't there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when Moses saw it, I we could say he saw it audio and video. He saw it vision. In a vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's how he wrote everything down. What he saw by vision. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that Moses wrote that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. But he was not there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When it happened. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's not first Adam. &gt;&gt; It's Genesis in Germany. It's the first book of Moses. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's not first Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't wrote the story about himself. &gt;&gt; It was Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wrote what happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Moses wrote what he saw as a vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. You know what a prophet is? Yes. That's why Ram said, "A prophet, the word comes to the prophet." A prophet is an unveiler and the revealer of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You what? What? What? What Moses Moses saw in a vision? He wrote down. THAT'S WHY HE COULD WRITE DOWN HE LIVED 365 YEARS. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM SAW THE VISION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Do we believe he saw the vision? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A PROPHET. HE WAS A MAN SENT FROM GOD. WILLIAM RENA WAS HIS NAME and he was telling in so many times you can hear him preach and tell tell the story and he he he just said he just said you can have it on tape. He said I just see as Adam and Eve walk in the garden of Eden and he said and I hear the bloody skin lapping on their legs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And everybody got emotional. Oh, what a nice story. Next day brother comes. Next day the prophet comes back to the pulpit and he said, "Do you remember how yesterday evening we spoke of Adam and Eve as I saw in a vision?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; And you will be amazed what brother Brandham is saying about Enoch. You know that brother Bam said that Enoch walked with God 500 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only not one time brother is saying he walked 365. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. He only said he walked 500. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; So, Enoch was a special man. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; According to my mathematics that I have out of the Bible, Enoch and Noah didn't know one another. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There 70 years of a lab. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God said they knew one. Brother said they knew one another. &gt;&gt; Actually, brother said they preached together. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Okay, let let me read it to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Third seal brother said like Noah kept watching Enoch. When Enoch went, Noah said better get close to the ark. &gt;&gt; The time is at 10. Noah kept watching Enoch. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; First seal. What was it like Enoch? You know, Noah watched Enoch. For when Enoch come up missing, he knowed judgment was at hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he was hanging around the ark. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, but normally when Noah was born, Enoch was gone already, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I I trust I can say that &gt;&gt; we are gone already. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. To make it very simple, I can say I'm not what I want to be, &gt;&gt; but I'm not what I was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; quickly then we start with Enoch. But Enoch was a man like like brother Adam said finally at the at the at the end let's say it that way after 500 years. Okay. But at the end God said to uh God said to God said to uh Enoch, Enoch, I think I think you're tired walking under solemn conditions. &gt;&gt; Enoch said yes I'm tired. Yeah, that's what he said. &gt;&gt; Then God said to him, "Okay, Enoch, when you're tired, come up." &gt;&gt; And Enoch said, "Okay." &gt;&gt; Daily routine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that colored brother? I think the prophet spoke about him that came one morning, one Sunday morning to church and the whole church was totally torn to pieces. And that old colored brother came in and he looked around and everybody was upset, you know, everybody was crying, running around. He said, "Hey, hey, what's up? What's going on?" He said, "The rapture has taken place. Have you not heard it?" He looked, he said, "That's funny." He said, "I spoke to him this morning and he never said a word of it, [laughter] &gt;&gt; church." &gt;&gt; It will be so simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. It cannot happen without you. &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH. DON'T LET THE ENEMY TELL YOU DIFFERENT. IT CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; KEEP THAT ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHY HE SENT A MESSAGE TO YOU &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE SPECIAL. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Genesis 5:21-24 tells us that he lived so long and then God took him. It make makes it very plain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God took him and he was not. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What means that he was not? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You know that I'm not what I was. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I once was blind, but I'm not blind anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because now I can see &gt;&gt; and God took him and Enoch was not &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now to make it to to wound it up the work God taking him means marriage &gt;&gt; you can look it upraise &gt;&gt; God took him means a marriage took place did a marriage took place in our day revelation 10:1-7 COME ON CHURCH we had a prophet on the scene &gt;&gt; IS THAT S IS THIS THE YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS TAKING REVELATION 10:1-7. &gt;&gt; IS that correct? &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1 is Christ. Revelation 10:7 is the marriage counselor. &gt;&gt; Hey, come on, read the breach. Read the breach. &gt;&gt; When brother Adam SPEAKS OF THE LAMB TAKING THE BOOK, THEN BROTHER MAKES A STATEMENTS, LET HIM COME FORTH WHEN HE WILL. &gt;&gt; And in the same message, brother Brandham said the prophet would say he's turning to the audience. HE SAID, "SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER hold your peace." &gt;&gt; You can read it all in the sermon. WHAT IS HAPPENING? A MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE. &gt;&gt; And his yes is when he takes the book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who is the book? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the book? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the book? Come on. Who's the book? &gt;&gt; SO, HE COMES DOWN AND HE TAKES YOU FOR MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; AS HE TOOK ENOCH for marriage and Enoch was not. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What can we do now? Like Enoch. &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it okay? One more. &gt;&gt; Actually, we should go. It makes it very simple. Is actually the last the last to a a condition to be rapture ready. a the right kind of um to be ready ready for the change. Well, it's very obvious when we look at what we know what will happen did not happen yet, which is the last rapture, the third one in the New Testament, which we understand the prophet said will be the two witnesses. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Now, I want to I want to really get you to your get you to your toes and see what it means to be ready to be raptured. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know that those two witnesses will be killed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, we we can we we don't have the time. Read Revelation 10 11 7-12. We don't read it. We don't read it. We don't have the time. Read at home and see what's happened to them. They do great signs and wonders and great things and everybody would say, "Yeah, those guys are ready for rapture." And now the system kills them. &gt;&gt; Are they still ready for rapture? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, NOT ONLY THAT, NOW HOW LONG DO THEY LAY DEAD IN THE STREET? WHAT DO YOU THINK of guys laying dead IN THE STREET, KILLED BY THE SYSTEM? &gt;&gt; Are they ready for rapture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. You understand? &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE READY BY ready for rapture. &gt;&gt; THOSE GUYS ARE READY FOR RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Somebody may say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Yeah. You understand our our our own thinking about readiness &gt;&gt; vanish away. &gt;&gt; Are they ready FOR RAPTURE? &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW BUT BUT THINK ALL THE world they make PRESENTS TO ONE ANOTHER. HE SAID YEAH THOSE TERRORISTS WE KILLED THEM FINALLY. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. &gt;&gt; And then they least three three days and and they nearly the bodies are nearly start shrinking and stinking. Rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us &gt;&gt; to just keep the right attitude &gt;&gt; in all the stuff. [clears throat] The second one that actually was was changed was and here here really where it linked up with me where is the one that was a man like passion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will be amazed what it means to be rapture ready. &gt;&gt; And I tell you when you see that Satan has lost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you see that Satan has lost. Regardless how you feel, regardless how low you are, &gt;&gt; has nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just keep the attitude right. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? Just keep the attitude right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Uh first of first of all I want to say about Elijah. He was a man of many miracles. What? But was the amount of miracles a measure to be ready for rapture? &gt;&gt; Then Elisha had to be raptured. &gt;&gt; Because he did double as much as Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Just really to to to get our things to the &gt;&gt; you know you to the normal life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't try to be magic. &gt;&gt; Yeah. to be raptured. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; I want to say again, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; How many miracles did Elijah, you meant how you counts eight or 16. Elisha did more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Double portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, it was not really to be raptured ready was not how many miracles happened in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; WHY I SAY THAT? BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS WHERE SATAN many times gets us. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. No. The man actually that did double his miracles died with his sickness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; My to me it's as I trust we can really get into it that it has an impact on us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So when Satan comes around, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; telling you, hey, you have no miracles in your life. &gt;&gt; And he's telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can say, "Get behind me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you take the courage to tell him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride by now should know who she is, &gt;&gt; right? This is not just a slogan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is not just a slogan. Brother brother said not not only when the bride knows who she is but when the bride knows what it is &gt;&gt; then the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; What is it? The grace of God. &gt;&gt; The next thing little bit about Elijah. Elijah it's uh you know that Elijah Elijah couldn't stop the death of Nabot. &gt;&gt; He couldn't stop &gt;&gt; Nabot dying. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Couldn't stop it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; He couldn't stop it. &gt;&gt; Rapture ready. &gt;&gt; He couldn't even stop Jezebel. &gt;&gt; So don't try to work against the system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many people in CO sorry when I say that. &gt;&gt; How many people in CO were trying against the system? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't be stupid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't waste your breath. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And that's what I told the people at home. Don't fight against the Jesus never was fighting against the system. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, he was there. He was there under under under uh Agria and under Caesar Augustus and the great guy THAT WANTED TO KILL HIM AND THEY asked him, "Shall we PAY TAX TO HIM?" He said, "Give to Caesars what is to him." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; One day, one guy came out of the city said, "You know that you are in our hands." Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think it was Pilate. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus said, "Unless it is given unto you, you can do nothing." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You understand? [snorts] &gt;&gt; So Elijah didn't fight the system. &gt;&gt; You're with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. further on uh we said we will close because I think it gets really too much. We could go to Jesus Christ. Now jump quickly in Jesus Christ when he was in Gethsemane when the spirit had left him. You think he was rapture ready? Mhm. Say what? Say it once again. When the spirit had left Jesus in Gethsemane, was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Whatever happens to you according to your purpose &gt;&gt; that God allows &gt;&gt; doesn't matter. That's right. True. When he healed the sick, when he fed the 5,000, was he rapture ready? Oh yes, he proved it. &gt;&gt; When he WAS HANGING AT THE CROSS AND SAYING, "MY GOD, MY GOD." WAS HE RAPTURE READY? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the garden, you know that he went three times. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; First time he said, "Lord, if that is take, if it's possible, take the cup away from me." &gt;&gt; But he said, "Not mine will be done." &gt;&gt; He walked again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "If that is possible, &gt;&gt; can you imagine? Take that cup away from me." But &gt;&gt; showing his attitude, &gt;&gt; "But on my will be done, but thy will be done." YEAH. &gt;&gt; THE THIRD TIME HE GOES BACK AND he said, "Lord, if it is possible, let this cup depart from me. But not my will be done, but thy will be done." &gt;&gt; Three times he went. Was he rapture ready? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Turn back to Elijah. Let's um read with me quickly and and and then we are closing. Then we are closing. Yeah, this will be I want to read two scriptures in in Kings which which which is very was very eyeopening to me about Elijah the one who was rapture ready. And I trust that we can get a little not encouragement out of it but just understand that Elijah made mistakes in his life, &gt;&gt; right? He made mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] And so we do mistakes. &gt;&gt; But was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; First Kings 19. First Kings 19. Let's quickly read that together. I trust you uh can bear with me &gt;&gt; for that for the time because &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so beautiful &gt;&gt; when stuff is around you &gt;&gt; and when you find yourself in mistakes that you did. &gt;&gt; You cannot blame nobody else &gt;&gt; too quick. We blame somebody else, &gt;&gt; right? But in this you come to times you can only blame yourself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But we shouldn't blame ourselves. Somebody can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Keep the right attitude. &gt;&gt; If you do a mistake, say sorry Lord and go on. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Chapter 19. And Ahab told Jezebel and all that Elijah had done and with all all his slain and all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, "So let the gods do unto me, and more also, if make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time." And when he saw that, he arose and went for his life and came to Bata with belonged to Judah, you know, and there he made his great mistake and he left his servant behind. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; This is a typical um manifestation when people are under depression. They want to be alone. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There he made his mistake. He left his servant behind. So if you walk into a depression, don't stay alone. &gt;&gt; Come to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, but but Elijah was like passion, &gt;&gt; right? Come on, CHURCH. HE WAS LIKE PASSION. And he was really coming into a deep depression. So deep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That he was sorry when I say that that he was suicidal. You said, "Lord, I tell ME I WANT TO DIE." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know what God said? &gt;&gt; Rest a little. &gt;&gt; God never said, "You should pray a little more." &gt;&gt; He said, "Rest. &gt;&gt; And by the way, here's something good to eat." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And as he was resting and eating, he came out of it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; He was a man. And now I ask you a question. Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; We will we will go and we will don't read the scripture. I just want to you can you can go for yourself. 2 Kings 2 chapter uh 2 4 and 6. 2 Kings 2 verse 2 4 and 6. That was finally Elijah's walk. Now listen very carefully. That was Elijah's walk into his change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So we can say the rapture, the change, the translation, right? &gt;&gt; It was the journey. It was the journey actually from Gilgal to Beta to Jericho to the Jordan. Watch Enoch. Uh watch watch Elijah on his way to be raptured &gt;&gt; as they came to the first place of the journey which was uh Gilgal. You know what he said to Elijah? &gt;&gt; Stay here. You know why? This is what people do when they are under depression. He said to Elisha, "Stay here." And Elisha said no. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Come on church. &gt;&gt; They came to the next place. Very amazing. To Betel. You know what he said again in Betel to Elisha? Stay here. &gt;&gt; A typical sign of someone that is under depression. He wants to be alone. &gt;&gt; What did Elisha said? No. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; So that means when stuff is around you has nothing to do when you fall into your deepest ditch. When you fall into your deepest depression has nothing to do with rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude. &gt;&gt; He came to the next. He came to finally to to Jericho. The same story. Same story always. All the time Elijah is trying to be alone. He said to Elijah, "Stay here." And Elisha said, "No." Elijah knew exactly what is the best for Elijah. &gt;&gt; When a man is in depression, don't leave him alone. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. AND HE WAS WALKING IN HIS mood and a chariot came. Can you see the story? A chariot came. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here Elijah and Elisha were talking. &gt;&gt; If I would be Elijah, I would jump in. &gt;&gt; You understand? [laughter] &gt;&gt; HERE, DAILY ROUTINE. COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HERE COMES THE SUPERNATURAL. I MEAN, A CHARIOT of fire. &gt;&gt; And here he's taking up Elisha. And by the way, AND ELIJAH, HEY, YOUR MANTLE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Are we rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Who is rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Ah, there's much more hands now up. &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand how simple it is? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; This is was just on my heart. Because Satan is fooling too much with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was raptured. &gt;&gt; No, it's too late. It's too late. There was the one of the matter factors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hanging at the cross. Just showing the right attitude. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just that. Yes. &gt;&gt; Couldn't be baptized anymore. &gt;&gt; And Jesus told him, "Today you will be with me in paradise." &gt;&gt; But you know that guy didn't stay long. &gt;&gt; He was raptured. &gt;&gt; As he walked into paradise, he could say, "It's time, friends." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Was he raptured? &gt;&gt; Was he THE ONE THAT APPEARED TO MANY in Jerusalem? Praise God. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Just the right attitude. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let us stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sorry I have to leave you a little bit in between, but uh I trust I trust we are encouraged. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When stuff is around us, &gt;&gt; don't worry. Praise &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, who want to who want to say thank you Lord? &gt;&gt; I'm sorry when I saw that it helped me. I cannot cannot do different. I said praise the Lord. I said my goodness there's hope for me. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you really the preacher, you know how many times he has really a low I mean it was it was it WAS JOB SAYING CURSE ME THE DAY that I was born.

Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we want to give Do you want Do we want to tell him together that we love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why not raise our hands? &gt;&gt; And don't wait. Don't wait for the one here in the front to pray for you. &gt;&gt; You pray yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will be your rapture. It will be your body changed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It is your union. &gt;&gt; God is interested in you personally. &gt;&gt; All of the raptures &gt;&gt; never was a family affair. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Never was a church affair. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is interested in you personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, Lord is such a great privilege of what we have come to Father and we stand in awe &gt;&gt; within your presence. [snorts] Understanding what you have done in our age, understanding what you have done in our time, understanding what has happened since the prophet has left the scene and how the bride of the true church will be the final voice under her messenger. And that messenger is no one else than Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Father, we love you. We so much appreciate you. We thank you for all the things that you have done. We thank you for your grace and for your mercy, &gt;&gt; Father. And as we walk from here, [snorts] may we may we help us that we can easier and quicker discern when the enemy is coming. and how difficult the time becomes. May we always keep the right attitude [snorts] and saying amen to the word. That was all that was for Eddie Wright. That was all that was for the woman in the Bible. When she said the right thing, you did what only you could do. And Father, this afternoon, we just want to say the right thing. We want to say amen to your word. What you have said about us is nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; We love you and we appreciate you so much. And as as we really are feeling, we are standing we are standing in awe within this great presence. Father, you have done it well. You have done it well and we want to thank you for that. May you bless this church. May you bless the ministry. [music] May you bless each and everyone that we can grasp what has happened in our day. Anoint our eyes. Anoint our hearts that we can serve thee better. [music] Not maybe not in more works or in some kind of expression [music] but just in an simple attitude. As Mary would say, it be to me according to your word. [music] We love you, Father. We appreciate so much. May you receive all the honor and the glory. Father, I see that there is an awareness and in people are in awe. If this is the truth, [music] it sounds so unusual. This is what it did to Mary. It sounded so unusual, but it was the truth. Help us to believe it. Help us to receive it. We ask it in your name. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen and amen. Hallelujah. Be it unto me. [music] Let's sing the Can we sing the song? Be it unto me. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Sorry for keeping you so long. Amen. [singing] &gt;&gt; According [music] to your words. According [singing] to [music] your promise I can stand [singing] [music] you cover upon [singing] my heart. The truth that sets me free [music] according [singing] to your [music] word. Oh, be [singing] it unto [music] me. Be [singing] it unto me. [music] According [singing] to your word, according [music and singing] to your promises, I can [music and singing] stand secure. Guard upon [music and singing] my heart the truth that sets [singing] me free according [singing] to [music] your word. Lead it [singing] unto me. [music] Amen. How simple. Let's just [music] agree with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I liked what he said about Mary. Mary Sarah looked at herself &gt;&gt; in discouragement. [music] Sarah had already tried to bring about the promise and she failed. When [music] she was young and able, it didn't work. And she tried with her own reasoning to come up with a plan with Hagar, and it didn't work. And she finally threw in the towel. This isn't going to work for me. I'm too old. doesn't work. Amen. But it was for her anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When it comes to Mary, Mary looks at herself. She can't do it either. How can I do [music] this knowing not a man? She's just as incapable. And and and [clears throat] the answer is no more scientific than anything. The Holy Ghost will overshadow you. &gt;&gt; But something inside of her said, [music] "Whatever you say, it's the truth. &gt;&gt; I received the promise." When it comes to a body change, I love that. What What are we going to do? &gt;&gt; What am I going to do? &gt;&gt; Am I going to strain hard and try hard and pop my atoms into changing? It's got to be his promise made manifest. It's got to be something he does in me. &gt;&gt; And I said, God, let me just [music] say, be it unto me. Amen. I love that marriage is a taking. I ask you a question. Has he taken you &gt;&gt; to himself? Taken you from what you were and brought you into another position? Amen. Let's walk in that position and believe what he's brought us into. He's already taken me [music] to himself. He's already taken me out of Leodysia. He's already brought me into a union with him. And that union with him is going to produce everything that it's supposed to produce. And one day, these atoms are going to change. But &gt;&gt; until then, I'm just going to enjoy him taking me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And enjoy the walk with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I believe like the brother said, it's [music] going to be easy. That the the change of Adams is not going to be hard. [music] It's going to be the common fair of life. It's just going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; And God's the one who controls revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I just want to keep saying, God, I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it, Lord. I'm not looking at my abilities or my inabilities. I've got a whole lot of inabilities. I'm not looking at my status in life. I'm not looking at all my failures, but I'm looking at your promise, [music] and I'm saying, I believe it, and I believe what you said about me, and I believe who I am because you identified me. &gt;&gt; I didn't call myself. You called me &gt;&gt; and I believe it. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's grateful? So grateful to be walking in this mystery revelation. Let's bow our heads together and just thank God for this word. Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful, God, for the revelation of your word. [music] And God, my mind can't put it all together. And I can't comprehend all that you're doing, Lord, but there's something in me that's saying, "Be [music] it unto me, Lord. I receive it by faith." I believe, Lord, that it's me that you're talking about. God, I'm no more worthy than anyone else, but God, I believe when you called me, you called my name. I heard my name in the preaching of the word, and I'm identified [music] in this message. And God, I believe when you came in an invisible union, I'm part of that union, Lord. You took me to yourself, Lord, and now I'm walking with you in a special relationship. It's something completely different. I'm separated from the world. I'm reserved only unto you. I'm hidden away from the world in many ways because of my union with you. And God, I just want to keep believing no matter what happens in the circumstances. Lord, as you came and preached through our brother, the stuff cannot change the truth. The circumstances cannot change what you've done and what you're doing. But God, may it all work together for your glory. And may every circumstance we find ourselves in, whether a good day or a bad day, with success or failure, with regardless of the circumstances, may we recognize we're walking in a peculiar place. For we are separated unto you and we're here for your glory and you're sounding, Lord, a voice through our lives. And God, you're finishing the promise in us. And you will complete it. You will bring it to completion, Lord. And I believe it, Father. God, I ask that you would bless us, Lord, as we walk out of here. May those things not fade away because, God, I know that we're going to encounter more stuff, more bad days, more discouraging things. But may it not phase us, Lord. May we realize the reality that we're walking in the truth of this word being real to us. [music] May we continue lift our hands and say, "Lord, I believe your word. I believe what you said about me. And thank you, Father. [music] Have your way in the midst of the stuff and the circumstances. Prove yourself once again mighty on my behalf. God, give us the courage to keep walking, keep expressing, that we keep living. And Lord, let our joy would remain for we understand the position we're in. [music] And God, we pray for our brother Andreas that you would continue to strengthen him and bless him for the work you have for our brother. [music] Thank you for bringing him our way and using him as a tool in your hand. And now may you refresh him and strengthen him for further service. And God, may we walk out of here. May we be strengthened and refreshed for further service for this life that we live. May it be [music] for your glory. Well, we love you. We ask for all these things in your precious name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Be unto me [singing] according to [music] your word, according [singing] to [music] your promises. I [singing] can stand [music] secure. Carve above my heart [singing] the truth [music] that sets me free. According to [singing and music] your word, oh me. [music] It was a tiny [singing] simple stable all beaten [music] and warm. Hardly a [singing and music] place for a king to behold. He didn't [music and singing] choose something special to reveal his majesty. Though [singing] I know [music] if I give control, he'll be born [singing] in [music] me. Let [singing] your word be born in the manger [music and singing] of my heart. Let it live in me. [music] [singing] Let it start. Live inside this [music and singing] house of clay and mold it every [music] day. Let your [singing] word be born in the manger [music] of my [singing] heart. Outwardly [music] [singing] I'm nothing, not much to behold, [singing] unlikely [music] a place for his word [singing] to unfold. But [music] if I just yield this [singing] vessel and let him have [music] his way from glory on [singing] to glory, he'll [music] change me day by day. Let [music] your word be born [singing] in the manger [music] of my heart. Let it [singing] live [music] in me. Let it [singing] [music] live inside this house of moldy [singing] day [music] by day. Let your word be [music] in the manger [singing] of [music] my heart. Outwardly. Outwardly [music and singing] and nothing. Not much to behold. Unlikely [music and singing] the place for his word to [singing] unfold. But if I [music] just yield this vessel [singing] and let him have his way from [music] glory [singing] onto glory, you'll change me day [singing] by day. [music] Let your word be born [singing] [music] in the manger of my heart. Let it [singing] live [music] in me. Let it start. [singing] [music] Live inside this house of clay and holy [singing] day by day. [music] Let your word be born in the manger [music and singing] of my heart. Let your word, [music] let [singing] your word be born in the manger [singing] of [music] my heart. Let it live in me. [music and singing] Let it start live inside [music] this house of clay. Holy [singing] day. Let your [music] word be born in [singing] the manger of [music] my heart. [singing]
