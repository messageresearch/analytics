[0:00] amen do you have that witness in your
[0:02] heart
[0:03] you're going all the way not because of
[0:06] anything we've done but what he's done
[0:08] and what he's doing he's given us
[0:10] witness he's testified he showed us
[0:13] and we know that by his grace we're
[0:16] going all the way
[0:18] god bless you it's certainly good to be
[0:20] with you this morning let's take our
[0:21] bibles while we're standing
[0:23] and let's turn to revelation chapter
[0:25] four
[0:27] i say i very much appreciated the
[0:29] special this morning that was
[0:31] that was a special special amen i love
[0:34] to see what god is doing when
[0:36] when the young people can get inspired
[0:38] about the word of god and things of god
[0:40] it's exciting to me you know they're
[0:43] just responding
[0:44] something within them is responding to
[0:46] an atmosphere
[0:47] and brother branham told us he says you
[0:49] can hatch a chicken egg
[0:51] under a pup it's the atmosphere and we
[0:54] believe that as
[0:55] as as adults as elders in the church if
[0:57] we can create an atmosphere of
[0:59] expectation of holiness an atmosphere of
[1:02] godliness
[1:03] then these then these little seeds of
[1:05] god can spring to life in this
[1:07] atmosphere
[1:08] and that's what the young people are
[1:09] responding to an atmosphere that's
[1:11] created by
[1:12] the holy ghost-filled believers and i
[1:14] say we got to come expecting there's
[1:15] still people being birthed into the
[1:17] kingdom
[1:18] we've got to come create an atmosphere
[1:19] come early be in prayer
[1:22] pull worship create an atmosphere
[1:24] because we're seeing the fruits of it
[1:26] and i like the fruits
[1:29] let's keep pressing on god bless you
[1:31] brother kyle it's good to see you here
[1:33] we didn't think you and your family are
[1:34] going to make it but this is a this is a
[1:36] treat he's been going a long time
[1:38] and so we're going to have brother kyle
[1:39] minister for us on wednesday
[1:41] so that'll be wonderful hopefully he can
[1:43] share a little bit about
[1:44] what he's been doing on the other side
[1:46] of the continent and we enjoy that
[1:49] lord bless you let's let's take a look
[1:50] at revelation chapter four
[1:54] in verse 2 and immediately i was in the
[1:58] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[2:00] heaven and one side on the throne
[2:02] and he that sat was to look upon like
[2:04] jasper and sardine stone and there was a
[2:06] rainbow round about the throne
[2:08] in sight like an emerald and round about
[2:10] the throne were four and 20 seats and
[2:12] upon the seats i saw four and twenty
[2:14] elders sitting clothed in white raiment
[2:16] and they had on their heads crowns of
[2:18] gold and out of the throne proceeded
[2:20] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[2:22] and there were seven lamps of fire
[2:24] burning before the throne which are the
[2:26] seven spirits of god
[2:28] and before the throne there was a sea of
[2:29] glass like under crystal and in the
[2:31] midst of the throne and round about the
[2:33] throne
[2:34] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[2:37] behind
[2:38] the first beast was like a lion and the
[2:40] second beast like a
[2:41] like a calf and the third beast had a
[2:43] face as a man
[2:44] and the fourth beast was like a flying
[2:46] eagle
[2:47] now if you notice that wasn't a perched
[2:49] eagle
[2:51] it was like a flying eagle because
[2:53] that's the differentiation between the
[2:55] eagle and the other three beasts is that
[2:56] it can fly
[2:58] and it's a flying eagle amen verse eight
[3:01] and the four beasts had each of them six
[3:03] wings about him and they were full of
[3:04] eyes within
[3:05] and they rest not day and night saying
[3:07] holy holy holy lord god almighty which
[3:10] was and is
[3:11] and is to come and when those beasts
[3:13] give glory and honor and thanks to him
[3:15] that sat on the throne who liveth
[3:16] forever and ever
[3:18] the four and twenty elders fall down
[3:19] before him that sat on the throne and
[3:21] worship him that liveth forever and ever
[3:23] and cast their crowns before the throne
[3:25] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[3:28] glory and honor
[3:29] and power for thou hast created all
[3:31] things
[3:32] for thy pleasure they are and were
[3:35] created
[3:36] this is bower heads our heavenly father
[3:39] we thank you lord that we can come again
[3:40] to you lord
[3:42] lord jesus we thank you that you made
[3:44] your presence known among us by keeping
[3:46] your promise lord and god i pray now
[3:48] that as we take these
[3:50] pages of this physical book and open it
[3:52] and read it
[3:53] lord that you would do something
[3:54] supernatural that you would reveal to us
[3:57] your word lord and that you would show
[3:58] us lord yourself
[4:00] in the pages of your word and lord as we
[4:02] share what's on our heart i pray that
[4:04] you'd move the man to the side and
[4:05] that you would speak yourself lord
[4:07] through these lips and that we could
[4:09] receive from you and that
[4:10] that we have need of this morning we
[4:12] love you we give you preeminence
[4:14] in this place in jesus christ's name
[4:16] amen
[4:17] you can be seated
[4:24] praise the lord if we bring the
[4:26] powerpoint up
[4:28] we're going to continue on in the fourth
[4:29] seal and eventually we're just going to
[4:31] have to stop preaching the fourth seal
[4:33] because i came to a realization while i
[4:35] was studying i realized that the fourth
[4:37] seal was the message of the hour
[4:40] and so we could preach on that from now
[4:43] until we receive a body change and go
[4:44] meet him in the air
[4:46] because brother branham told us in the
[4:47] beginning he said now this is
[4:49] this is the most important message to us
[4:52] at this time
[4:53] because the four seal is the message
[4:55] it's the finishing up of everything it's
[4:57] the wrap up of the gentile dispensation
[4:59] the wrap of the church
[5:00] the rapture of the church and the
[5:01] explanation of all of that but i want to
[5:03] take a look at one thing that we have
[5:06] going on here and and i want to
[5:09] it'll be just a little bit of review but
[5:11] there's one certain angle that i want to
[5:12] focus on and pay attention to
[5:14] and i want to look at guarding the mercy
[5:16] seat because we find out that wherever
[5:18] god's throne was we see these four
[5:20] living creatures
[5:21] and brother brenham tells us very
[5:23] specifically that these four living
[5:24] creatures
[5:25] that we see depicted here as the lion
[5:27] the calf the man and the eagle
[5:29] he said these are always around the
[5:32] mercy seat
[5:33] amen and we see it in the wilderness
[5:35] journey we see it in ezekiel we see it
[5:38] all over in the bible
[5:39] but wherever we have the mercy seat or
[5:41] the throne of god because the throne of
[5:42] god is the mercy seat
[5:44] wherever we have that we have these four
[5:46] living creatures
[5:47] and they're to guard the mercy seat and
[5:50] we take this all the way back to genesis
[5:52] chapter 3 verse 24 it says so he drove
[5:54] out the man this is after man had fallen
[5:57] and disobeyed the commandments of god
[5:59] and he was driven out of the garden of
[6:00] eden and he drove out the man and placed
[6:03] at the east of the garden of eden
[6:04] cherubims now see that's plural
[6:06] not a cherubim cherubims brother venom
[6:09] said these were the
[6:10] the four living creatures amen and a
[6:13] flaming sword which turned every way
[6:15] to keep the way of the tree of life
[6:18] now keep that in your mind that their
[6:20] job the job of these living creatures
[6:22] the job of these
[6:23] guards around the mercy seat are to keep
[6:26] the way
[6:27] of the tree of life amen sometimes they
[6:31] keep away from the tree of life
[6:33] and sometimes they drive you into the
[6:35] tree of life
[6:36] but their job is to keep or guard the
[6:39] word keep means to guard
[6:41] like a keep would be uh like a prison
[6:43] cell and a castle would be the keep
[6:46] or a place of safety that you run into
[6:48] in a time of uh
[6:49] war would be a keep it's a it's a
[6:51] guarded place
[6:52] and so they keep the way of the tree of
[6:55] life
[6:56] amen they don't keep you away from the
[6:59] tree of life necessary they keep the way
[7:02] of the tree of life so there's a path to
[7:04] the tree of life
[7:05] and these living creatures are the guard
[7:07] that keep that way amen
[7:09] they guard it they watch over and make
[7:11] sure that anybody
[7:13] coming the right way has free access to
[7:16] the tree of life
[7:17] but they're also there to make sure
[7:18] there's nothing to pollute the way amen
[7:20] that you can only come if you come the
[7:22] right way
[7:24] so we see that these living creatures
[7:26] are always
[7:27] around the throne of god the prophet
[7:30] says in the fifth seal now one of these
[7:32] creatures we find out in studying the
[7:33] revelation in the churches
[7:35] one of them was the lion and the other
[7:36] one was an ox and the other one was a
[7:38] man and the other one was an eagle
[7:40] we found out in the church ages that
[7:41] these four beasts meaning four powers
[7:44] was gathered around the acts of the
[7:46] apostles just
[7:47] the way the tabernacle in the wilderness
[7:50] so he's drawing a parallel
[7:52] between the tabernacle and the
[7:53] wilderness and then
[7:55] what takes place in the book of acts so
[7:57] i want to pay close attention to this
[7:59] and see
[8:00] all that we can glean out of this for us
[8:03] you know the everything that happened in
[8:05] the old testament was a shadow of things
[8:07] to come
[8:08] in in the the building of the tabernacle
[8:10] and the exodus journey and all of that
[8:12] was a shadow of other things
[8:14] and and paul the apostle tells us
[8:17] in the in hebrews that these these are
[8:20] for our examples
[8:21] all right so we want to pay close
[8:23] attention to these things
[8:25] he says you understand it so let's read
[8:27] this bold print again we find out the
[8:29] church ages that
[8:30] these four beasts meaning four powers
[8:32] was gathered around the acts of the
[8:34] apostles just the way
[8:35] the tabernacle in the wilderness you
[8:38] understand it because i won't take time
[8:39] to go in
[8:40] into it now we drawed it out here and
[8:42] showed it just exactly
[8:43] they were watching over this the lamb
[8:46] and the word
[8:47] to perform the word just as they did the
[8:49] ark of the covenant in the holy place
[8:51] in the wilderness so here they are
[8:53] guarding the ark of the covenant
[8:55] in the holy place and they're there to
[8:57] perform the word
[8:59] and to watch over the lamb same thing in
[9:03] our day
[9:04] there to perform the word and watch over
[9:05] the lamb
[9:07] so we know we've been through this this
[9:09] is review we know that
[9:10] in the wilderness when they set up camp
[9:12] around the tabernacle that
[9:14] moses was instructed to build and he
[9:15] fashioned it after pattern he's seen in
[9:17] heaven
[9:18] and when he set up the tribes he set up
[9:20] the tribes in a very specific order
[9:22] and he wanted this tribe camped here and
[9:24] this tribe camped here
[9:25] and when you look at the banners of the
[9:27] of the tribes that are placed around
[9:29] the this uh this tabernacle you find
[9:32] the banner of the lion the ox the man
[9:35] and the
[9:36] eagle all right you have judah and
[9:39] judah and reuben and ephraim and dan and
[9:42] you have that
[9:42] east to west to south to north
[9:45] and so we see the the the camp would be
[9:48] set up
[9:49] and the israelites would go in all
[9:51] directions
[9:52] around around this throne
[9:56] they were guarding or keeping the way
[9:59] of the tree of life because the shekinah
[10:02] glory of god which is life
[10:04] was going to come into this tabernacle
[10:06] and the approach was going to be by
[10:08] bringing blood
[10:09] through the right process through the
[10:10] right order and when an israelite would
[10:12] come the right way
[10:14] to approach unto god that blood was
[10:16] going to make its way to an altar amen
[10:18] and beyond that was going to be a
[10:19] shekinah glory and this was the only
[10:21] approach to the tree of life
[10:24] and third day this was the approach to
[10:25] the tree of life so he set them in camp
[10:28] around this
[10:29] showing these same four living creatures
[10:31] around the throne that's on earth
[10:34] so wherever you have wherever you have
[10:36] the mercy seat you have these four
[10:38] living creatures
[10:40] praise god
[10:44] brother graham said just exactly the
[10:45] tribes of israel camped around
[10:47] guarding their earthly guards of the
[10:50] right
[10:51] to the ark they're earthly guards
[10:54] of the right to the ark because there
[10:56] were certain people
[10:57] that had a right to approach unto god
[11:00] there was a certain nation and there's a
[11:02] certain way
[11:03] they had a right unto that ark they had
[11:05] a right
[11:06] unto the presence of god but there was
[11:08] only a certain people and only a certain
[11:10] way
[11:11] to take their rights and these guards
[11:13] were there
[11:14] guarding the right to the ark
[11:18] hallelujah don't you see it hear mercy
[11:22] mercy seat nothing could come anywhere
[11:24] around it without crossing those tribes
[11:26] crossing what the lion
[11:27] crossing the man the intelligence of man
[11:29] crossing the workhorse as an
[11:30] ox or crossing the eagle the swiftness
[11:33] of it the heaven the earth in between
[11:35] and all around you see
[11:36] there were guards and above it was the
[11:38] pillar of fire brother nothing touched
[11:40] that mercy seat without the approach
[11:42] and the only thing that could approach
[11:43] it was through the blood
[11:46] now these things are examples for us
[11:50] so in revelation chapter 4 god has a
[11:53] mercy seat today
[11:55] to be guarded you believe that where's
[11:58] the mercy seat found
[11:59] in the heart of man where did it come in
[12:03] the heart of man
[12:04] at the day of pentecost when the holy
[12:06] ghost which is god
[12:07] came into the heart of man amen when
[12:11] when god told him to set up this
[12:13] tabernacle when the shekinah glory the
[12:15] presence of god came upon the throne
[12:17] god was right there in his midst and
[12:18] that was the mercy seat of god
[12:21] upon the earth but there was a shift
[12:23] that took place in the mercy seat
[12:25] on the day of pentecost when now god
[12:27] could purge and cleanse
[12:29] a people and sanctify a people by his
[12:31] own blood
[12:32] so now he doesn't have to dwell in a
[12:34] tabernacle made with hands
[12:36] now he can come and dwell in the
[12:38] tabernacle of human flesh
[12:40] because his blood has paid the price to
[12:42] cleanse it to sanctify
[12:44] because nothing is clean without the
[12:45] sprinkling of blood
[12:47] every vessel everything in this
[12:48] tabernacle when before the glory of god
[12:51] would come
[12:52] in before the presence of god would come
[12:54] although it was done
[12:55] exactly what the way moses said it was
[12:58] built and fashioned the way he said
[12:59] all the implements were there but until
[13:02] they took the ashes
[13:03] of a red heifer and took the blood and
[13:06] until they went and sprinkled that blood
[13:08] and they sanctified that place then
[13:11] there was nothing the presence of god
[13:12] was not going to come in
[13:14] but now god was was he was he
[13:17] was killed without the camp and the red
[13:20] heifer was killed the red heifer that
[13:21] was the blood of sanctification
[13:23] to sanctify the dwelling place of god
[13:26] that died outside the camp
[13:29] not not on the holy mountain not in the
[13:31] camp but outside the camp
[13:33] and jesus died outside the camp amen
[13:36] and he became his blood became the
[13:38] waters of separation and the
[13:39] purification
[13:40] and now he can purify another dwelling
[13:44] place for the shekinah glory of god to
[13:45] come
[13:46] and jesus by his death amen by the
[13:49] purging of the blood of jesus christ
[13:51] he could cleanse another tabernacle so
[13:53] that the glory of god could come down
[13:55] into another dwelling place
[13:57] and that makes the mercy seat the heart
[13:59] of man
[14:01] when did he become the heart of man at
[14:03] pentecost
[14:04] amen he come into the human heart
[14:10] and so if there's always
[14:13] throne guards mercy seat guards there's
[14:15] there's always four creatures
[14:17] that have to guard the approach to the
[14:20] mercy seat they have to
[14:21] keep the way of the tree of life amen so
[14:25] now over the over the seven church ages
[14:27] god has had temple guards throne guards
[14:30] i mean he's had mercy seat guards
[14:32] they're watching over keeping the way to
[14:35] the tree of life
[14:36] and these were the four anointings of
[14:38] these four beasts in each in each of the
[14:40] church ages coming down through
[14:42] what were they doing they were keeping
[14:44] the way to the tree of life
[14:47] amen because you had to come the right
[14:49] way you had to come
[14:51] by the word they were keeping
[14:54] the way they were keeping the right to
[14:58] the ark
[14:59] because the elected of god had a right
[15:02] to the tree of life
[15:04] and these anointings were here making
[15:06] sure that they were guarding away
[15:08] or keeping away so that the elect could
[15:11] get to the tree of life
[15:12] amen how could you come to life in
[15:14] luther's day
[15:15] you had to come through luther's message
[15:17] amen because remember
[15:19] it was the word that bled for you it was
[15:21] the word i mean god
[15:23] god was made flesh amen and in the flesh
[15:25] the word was made flesh
[15:27] and that word had blood when it was made
[15:29] flesh and when that blood was shed
[15:31] the word was bleeding for you and now
[15:33] the path
[15:34] back is through the word and whenever
[15:36] god would send the word
[15:38] you had to walk in that path of the word
[15:40] and that would lead you back to the tree
[15:42] of life
[15:44] if you would reject this word amen you
[15:46] would be veered off from the tree of
[15:48] life but you had to come with the word
[15:50] for your day as it's restored
[15:52] that's the path and who's keeping that
[15:54] it's these anointings amen it's these
[15:56] throne guards
[15:56] that are anointing the people to keep
[15:58] the way of the tree of life
[16:01] amen it was a it was a lion anointing
[16:03] and an ox anointing and a man anointing
[16:06] what were they doing the anointing was
[16:08] going over the elective that day
[16:10] and the anointing was calling out a
[16:11] luther calling out a wesley
[16:13] anointing them to see the word for their
[16:15] day and what were they doing they were
[16:17] keeping the way
[16:18] to the tree of life keeping the way to
[16:22] the right
[16:23] of the ark
[16:26] brother ram said these four anointings
[16:28] keep the way
[16:29] of the book of acts and he calls it
[16:31] matthew mark luke and john and matthew
[16:33] mark luke and john
[16:34] are there guarding the book of acts
[16:37] this gets interesting for me this is
[16:39] wonderful
[16:40] because what are the book of acts what
[16:42] is the book of acts what are the garden
[16:44] guarding and why are the four gospels
[16:46] guarding the book of acts
[16:49] you know what about the rest of the
[16:51] bible i mean what about
[16:52] all the epistles of paul and what about
[16:54] the book of revelation and all that
[16:56] brother brennam's trying to show us
[16:58] something here this in the book of acts
[17:00] is where the mercy seat had moved into
[17:02] the heart of man
[17:04] and and now what was guarding that is
[17:06] the four gospels
[17:07] how were the four gospels guarding that
[17:09] the four gospels are talking about the
[17:11] ministry of jesus christ
[17:14] we receive that the life of jesus the
[17:17] works of jesus
[17:18] the death of jesus the resurrection of
[17:20] jesus it's all there in those four
[17:22] gospels
[17:22] and what are those four gospels doing
[17:24] they're guarding the book of acts
[17:25] because now when the dwelling place
[17:27] would move from one man jesus christ
[17:30] he was the mercy seat amen he was the
[17:32] tabernacle of god
[17:34] he was the place of the shekinah glory
[17:36] but it was going to move from the one
[17:37] man jesus christ
[17:39] into a many-membered body on the day of
[17:41] pentecost and what was the proof
[17:43] what was the evidence the vindication
[17:45] was the manifestation of the life
[17:48] and the 120 that poured out of the upper
[17:50] room speaking in tongues and
[17:52] and and deciphering the word and laying
[17:54] out prophecies
[17:55] what was that it was a proof that the
[17:57] same life that was in the man that was
[17:59] in matthew mark
[18:00] luke and john that same life is now in
[18:03] the people of the book of acts
[18:04] and the mercy seat has transferred
[18:07] hallelujah you cannot recognize the
[18:09] mercy seat
[18:10] unless you find where these throne
[18:12] guards are because they're the ones
[18:14] keeping the way to the tree of life
[18:17] you can't come through there's no way to
[18:19] get to the ark unless you pass through
[18:21] these anointings
[18:24] amen and we live in a day
[18:27] where you can't pass through just the
[18:29] lion anointing
[18:31] or just the ox anointing there's a path
[18:33] for you to walk and it's through the
[18:34] eagle anointing
[18:37] hallelujah so the battle plan
[18:41] what's been happening now is there's a
[18:44] fight breaking out
[18:45] and there's a war but this war very much
[18:48] is
[18:48] over the path to the tree of life
[18:52] the warfare is very much satan is trying
[18:55] to keep the people of god from the word
[18:57] of god
[18:58] trying to keep them from the
[18:59] manifestation of the life he doesn't
[19:01] want the people to manifest the word for
[19:03] their day
[19:03] he doesn't want the life of jesus christ
[19:05] to be on display
[19:06] so he's here doing everything he can to
[19:09] plug up to pervert
[19:10] to pollute the way of the tree of life
[19:13] that's why every time they'd bring true
[19:15] doctrine he'd come along with false
[19:16] doctrine
[19:17] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[19:19] corrupt the way to the tree of life
[19:21] because there's only one way and you've
[19:23] got to come through these anointings to
[19:25] walk that way
[19:26] and they're keeping it and it's a word
[19:28] way because you can only come by the
[19:30] blood
[19:30] amen in the blood amen is the word
[19:36] amen the shedding of the blood was the
[19:40] sacrifice of the word
[19:43] and now to be part of that blood
[19:45] atonement you have to be part of the
[19:47] word
[19:48] you can't walk any other way and these
[19:50] four anointings are keeping the way of
[19:52] the word
[19:53] laying down more word word for this day
[19:55] the approach
[19:56] the right to the ark the path to the
[19:58] tree of life
[20:02] so what are they trying to do they're
[20:03] trying to come in this
[20:05] antichrist spirit he's death his name is
[20:08] death
[20:09] he's been death since the beginning he's
[20:11] named at the end but it's been the same
[20:13] writer he's always been death
[20:14] what's he doing if he can keep you from
[20:16] the path the word path to the tree of
[20:18] life
[20:18] you're in death that's why he's death
[20:21] because anything that's not life is
[20:23] death
[20:25] and so he's trying there's a war here
[20:28] but god saw
[20:28] fit that he would have the throne the
[20:31] mercy seat guards
[20:32] they're always there in every age
[20:34] keeping the way to the tree of life
[20:36] keeping the way and only those who come
[20:38] the blood way
[20:39] can go to the tree of life that's why
[20:42] the the devil will always try to create
[20:44] substitutes
[20:45] for the way there's many ways many paths
[20:48] but there's that's not true there's only
[20:50] one
[20:54] so we want to focus on this fourth
[20:56] anointing
[20:58] brother branham tells a story in the
[20:59] fourth seal
[21:02] he starts talking about a meeting he had
[21:05] in chicago
[21:06] he said i said there in chicago the
[21:08] other day for more ministers than there
[21:10] are people sitting here
[21:11] and there they had me pinned off about
[21:13] the doctrine of serpent seed and all
[21:15] this other thing
[21:16] i said someday i said somebody get your
[21:19] bible
[21:20] and come here and stand by me then
[21:22] nobody said nothing
[21:24] now don't read any further i want to
[21:26] explain this story to you
[21:28] that brother branham is is going down in
[21:31] 1961
[21:33] in the early part of 1961. i think it
[21:36] was april
[21:36] 1961. you can hear the message uh the
[21:39] explanation of the godhead
[21:41] and before he gets to the meeting a
[21:42] couple days before he gets to the
[21:43] meeting
[21:44] god shows him a vision and he tells him
[21:46] to go stand by this third door by the
[21:48] window there and he stands there
[21:49] and he begins to see and he says see
[21:52] they're not going to get the place
[21:53] they've rented
[21:55] god's going to move it to another place
[21:56] this place will be a room that's brown
[21:58] or whatever
[21:59] and he showed him everywhere they were
[22:00] sitting he says they've got a trap set
[22:02] for you
[22:03] amen they're going to disagree with you
[22:05] on your doctrine
[22:07] and brother branham says he tells this
[22:09] story several places
[22:10] but he said your doctrine of serpent
[22:12] seed and water baptism in jesus name in
[22:14] godhead
[22:16] and so now the the he said there was
[22:19] over 300 i believe is what he said there
[22:21] was
[22:22] or about 300 and it was the greater
[22:24] minister of the ministerial association
[22:26] of greater chicago
[22:27] so these are ministers from all kinds of
[22:29] denominations they're gathered together
[22:31] and they've agreed that they're going to
[22:32] challenge brother branham on his
[22:34] doctrine
[22:34] and god showed him a few days before
[22:38] amen this is good
[22:41] this is real good friends
[22:45] amen
[22:49] brother benham says in the third seal he
[22:51] tells it like this
[22:53] he says now i don't believe in fussing
[22:56] with people
[22:57] but when it comes to a spot where they
[22:58] try to drag you into it
[23:00] and i wouldn't have went but the holy
[23:02] spirit told me said go on over there
[23:04] i'll stand by you amen
[23:08] and so he he sat down with uh i think it
[23:11] was carl williams and tommy hicks and he
[23:12] began to explain to him
[23:14] you're not going to get that room and
[23:15] the man said we're going to get it we've
[23:16] already paid the down payment it's been
[23:18] reserved he said you're not going to get
[23:19] it
[23:19] that room looks like this you're going
[23:20] to have a room that looks like this and
[23:22] this brother will be sitting here and
[23:23] that brother will be sitting there and
[23:24] begins to describe it to him
[23:26] and sure enough on the day of the event
[23:28] they found out that it was double booked
[23:30] they couldn't have the place they had to
[23:31] scramble and find another place
[23:33] and and and they tell him brother bam is
[23:35] exactly like you said
[23:36] well he wasn't doubting it he wasn't
[23:38] surprised it was going to be exactly
[23:40] what he said
[23:41] amen he said they've got a trap set for
[23:44] you they're going to ask you to speak at
[23:46] the ministerial association of the
[23:47] greater chicago
[23:48] they've got a trap set for you on your
[23:50] teaching of my word
[23:52] amen
[23:56] then brother bam says later in the quote
[23:58] in the third seal he says well
[23:59] i thought i'd better not go over there
[24:02] then lord
[24:03] if they're going to do that i don't want
[24:05] to hurt their feelings or do anything
[24:06] wrong
[24:07] he said go i'll stand by you
[24:10] so brother venom knows in him as a human
[24:13] being
[24:14] he doesn't want to go down there and
[24:15] fuss he doesn't want to fight and if
[24:17] people are going to disagree with him
[24:18] he's fine just letting them disagree
[24:20] but god had another purpose here and the
[24:22] holy spirit said you
[24:24] go i'll stand by you
[24:27] you're not going alone amen you're going
[24:30] with an eagle anointing for this age
[24:32] you're not going by yourself but you're
[24:34] going for a very specific purpose to
[24:36] this meeting
[24:38] hallelujah in the
[24:41] in the fourth seal i'll just finish this
[24:43] quote and then we'll
[24:44] we'll move on it says there was about 50
[24:47] or 75 said i'm coming down
[24:49] there to be re-baptized did they come
[24:52] not
[24:53] one of them why he give them space to
[24:56] repent
[24:56] he will cast their children to death
[24:59] spiritual
[25:00] death there is something very
[25:03] significant taking place at that meeting
[25:06] then brother branham could go and he
[25:08] could take and he begins to lay out his
[25:10] doctrine and he begins to talk about
[25:12] how he came to this understanding and
[25:15] begin to reveal the scriptures and talk
[25:16] about
[25:17] uh the understanding of god the one the
[25:19] godhead versus trinity
[25:21] and he lays it all out and then he says
[25:23] about 70 some of them decide they're
[25:25] going to come down and be baptized
[25:26] brother bram tells us many
[25:28] many times he says but here he is in the
[25:30] fourth seal
[25:31] and we realize when we get to the fourth
[25:33] seal we're at the wrap up of the church
[25:34] amen
[25:35] we're at the pending judgment we're at
[25:37] the time for the rapture of the church
[25:38] and brother branham's standing here and
[25:40] he's saying now see
[25:43] he give them space to repent
[25:47] brother branham is tying this right back
[25:50] to thyatira
[25:52] take your bibles and turn to revelation
[25:55] chapter 2
[26:03] revelations chapter 2 verse 18 and unto
[26:06] the angel the church and thyatira right
[26:08] these things saith the son
[26:10] of god who hath his eyes like unto the
[26:13] flame of fire and his feet are like the
[26:15] fine brass
[26:16] and i know thy works and i charity and
[26:18] service and faith
[26:19] and thy patience and thy works and the
[26:21] last being more than the first
[26:24] notwithstanding i have a few things
[26:25] against thee because thou suffers that
[26:27] woman jezebel
[26:29] which calleth herself a prophetess to
[26:30] teach and to seduce my servants to
[26:32] commit fornication
[26:33] and to eat things sacrificed into idols
[26:36] and i gave her space to repent of her
[26:38] fornication and she
[26:40] repented not behold i will cast her into
[26:44] a bed and they that commit adultery with
[26:45] her into great tribulation
[26:47] except they repented their deeds and i
[26:49] will kill her children with death
[26:52] so brother branham is now taking this
[26:54] statement
[26:55] he says he give them space to repent he
[26:57] will cast their children to death
[26:59] spiritual death
[27:00] he's taking this right out of the
[27:02] thyatira church age
[27:03] and what he's showing is the catholic
[27:05] church moved through these stages
[27:07] through the first four church ages but
[27:08] when they get to thyatira
[27:10] now jezebel is ruling amen now the
[27:13] catholic church is in full domination
[27:15] she's in full power amen she calls
[27:17] herself a prophetess but she's not amen
[27:20] in the in the
[27:21] people have committed fornication with
[27:22] her and she's going to be thrown into a
[27:24] bed
[27:24] and those that commit fornication with
[27:26] her into the into great tribulation
[27:28] amen he's showing the oncoming judgment
[27:31] and he says and i will kill her children
[27:34] which is the protestant churches that's
[27:37] the children
[27:38] there's the and the harlots and we
[27:40] find it over here in thyatira
[27:41] because now we see that this is the
[27:44] judgment of the
[27:45] amen and thyatira because she's come to
[27:47] full power after this the catholic
[27:49] church diminished in power and the
[27:50] protestant church began
[27:53] but the protestant church has followed
[27:54] the exact same pattern of the catholic
[27:56] church
[27:57] and now they get down here to this point
[27:59] and the fourth seal where brother
[28:00] branham is talking about
[28:02] being in chicago and being challenged on
[28:04] teaching of the godhead and
[28:06] water baptism in jesus name and serpent
[28:08] seed and now he lays it out
[28:10] and he and he lays out the doctrine and
[28:12] here he is the eagle anointing and a
[28:14] prophet
[28:15] and the eagle anointing is laying out
[28:17] what's he laying out the path to the
[28:19] tree of life
[28:21] what's he guarding he's guarding the
[28:23] path to the tree of life
[28:24] and he's laying out before the greater
[28:26] chicago ministerial association
[28:29] they re represent all the churches in
[28:32] chicago or the majority of the church in
[28:34] chicago
[28:35] they're represented here and and
[28:37] basically there's a cross section of the
[28:39] world represented right here in chicago
[28:41] or at least the united states then and
[28:44] he lays out this doctrine
[28:45] and then some of them testify that
[28:47] that's right i'm coming down
[28:48] they get to get prayed for even tommy
[28:50] hicks says i've never seen it like that
[28:52] i want 300 copies of that message to
[28:54] give to my
[28:55] my ministers and brother ben said did
[28:58] any of them come
[28:58] he said not one of them come he give her
[29:01] space to repent
[29:04] he will cast their children to death
[29:06] spiritual
[29:08] death because the protestants now
[29:11] have come the same way the catholics
[29:15] and now they've been given the same
[29:17] opportunity space to repent
[29:19] and they rejected it just like the
[29:20] catholic church and now he's going to
[29:22] kill the children with death just like
[29:24] the
[29:25] it's amazing how brother branham picks
[29:27] these words right out of thyatira
[29:28] because what is thyatire the fourth
[29:30] stage or the fourth age of the catholic
[29:32] church
[29:33] and now we're in the fourth seal amen
[29:36] now we're in the fourth stage
[29:38] now we're at the end of the protestant
[29:39] church and it looks exactly like
[29:41] the catholic church looked hallelujah
[29:46] now listen to this revelation chapter
[29:49] five brother ben says
[29:50] that morning same story he had told
[29:52] billy paul what lord showed him he said
[29:54] my son said to me hey daddy
[29:56] are you going over there in them fuss
[29:58] and i said i ain't going over the fuss
[30:00] i'm going over anointed with the holy
[30:02] spirit
[30:02] with the word of god that'll guard the
[30:05] mercy seed
[30:06] long as he's there brother man said i'm
[30:10] going
[30:11] anointed with the eagle anointing of the
[30:13] holy ghost
[30:15] i'm going over there amen as a
[30:17] representative of the throne guard
[30:20] with a word of god because the word is
[30:22] the sword
[30:23] amen with the word of god that will
[30:25] guard that mercy seat
[30:26] as long as he's there as long as he's
[30:30] where
[30:30] as long as he's on that mercy seat what
[30:33] mercy seat the one that began at
[30:34] pentecost as long as he's there
[30:37] there's a word that is going to guard
[30:39] that mercy seat
[30:40] and here we have the fourth beast
[30:42] anointing on a prophet
[30:43] amen and the prophet is always an eagle
[30:45] so we have an evil anointing on an
[30:47] eagle anointed of the holy ghost with
[30:50] the word of god
[30:51] that'll guard that mercy seat as long as
[30:53] he's there
[30:55] do you believe he's still on the mercy
[30:56] seat then that mercy seat is guarded
[30:59] what's it guarded with
[31:00] by the word of god under an eagle
[31:02] prophetic eye anointing amen that could
[31:04] stand there in front of
[31:06] 300 or so ministers that were
[31:08] disagreeing with him
[31:09] and he could take his bible and he could
[31:11] challenge them what was the sword that
[31:13] he used
[31:14] it was the word and he says i took my
[31:16] bible and i said if you can disagree me
[31:18] bring your bible and stand alongside
[31:20] me what's he defending it with
[31:24] with the sword of the spirit which is
[31:26] the word of god
[31:29] keeping what the way of the tree
[31:32] of life you can't come to the tree of
[31:36] life
[31:37] any other way when brother branham come
[31:39] down
[31:40] and he laid out serpent seed water
[31:43] baptism in jesus name
[31:44] the doctrine of the godhead when he laid
[31:46] that down when those 300 men
[31:48] when they refused to come down he says
[31:51] they've been given
[31:52] space to repent and he will kill their
[31:54] children with spiritual death
[31:57] he's making a declaration as in thyatira
[32:00] that if they do not come this path they
[32:03] are dead
[32:05] what was the path the path was the true
[32:07] word that had been restored in this day
[32:10] hallelujah which is why we don't play
[32:13] around
[32:14] with the word friends that's why when a
[32:16] eagle anointing on our eagle prophet
[32:18] when it restored to us the full word
[32:20] that full word is the path to the tree
[32:22] of life
[32:23] it is the way of the tree of life and
[32:25] that is the only way that you can come
[32:27] to the tree of life
[32:31] he says further down he says the holy
[32:34] spirit begin to take the word of god and
[32:36] reveal it and interpret it down like
[32:38] that
[32:38] when all those bunch of trinitarian
[32:40] ministers sitting there
[32:41] reaching under the table and shaking
[32:43] hands with one another and tears running
[32:44] down their cheeks
[32:45] and i understand that 72 of them is
[32:47] coming down here this tabernacle for me
[32:49] to baptize them
[32:50] in the name of jesus christ the mercy
[32:52] seat is guarded see
[32:54] the holy spirit guarding the mercy seat
[32:58] what was happening in chicago the holy
[33:01] spirit was guarding the mercy seat
[33:05] is there still a mercy seat if there's
[33:09] still a mercy seal on earth
[33:10] is there still a throne guard guarding
[33:13] the mercy seat
[33:16] hallelujah remember now we're in the
[33:19] fourth seal
[33:20] we're in the wrap-up of the church
[33:24] the easter seal in 1965 brother baby
[33:26] said we
[33:27] were for ordained of god for this hour
[33:29] are you for ordained of god for this
[33:31] hour
[33:32] not for a previous hour your four
[33:34] ordained of god for this hour
[33:36] the word of god manifests itself right
[33:38] through us and we live in the presence
[33:40] of god by the word promised of god
[33:43] ain't a devil in hell can keep me from
[33:45] raising
[33:46] ain't a door he could shut my face at
[33:48] that morning the seals has been broken
[33:50] hallelujah so now brother branham is
[33:53] going to attach he's attaching the
[33:54] resurrection to the opening of the seal
[33:59] amen and i don't just mean the
[34:01] resurrection that's coming when we have
[34:02] a change of the body
[34:04] he's attaching the resurrection to the
[34:05] opening of the seals
[34:07] listen when he says now i'm free i'm a
[34:10] i'm an eagle i'm no longer in a cage but
[34:13] i'm free
[34:14] i've raised from the dead unto the new
[34:16] life of jesus christ
[34:17] not only me but every man woman boy or
[34:19] girl sitting here that's been filled
[34:21] with the spirit of god
[34:22] is a new creature in christ you are a
[34:26] eagle amen
[34:29] so he starts to starts to say we're
[34:31] foreign of god for this hour
[34:34] what is this hour it's an eagle hour
[34:37] you're for ordained of god for this hour
[34:39] amen
[34:40] you the the that we have the presence of
[34:43] god
[34:43] nothing can shut my door on the
[34:45] resurrection to shut the door in my face
[34:47] no demon from hell
[34:48] can keep me from raising amen why
[34:51] because the seal's been broken
[34:54] and now i'm free i'm an eagle and i'm no
[34:57] longer
[34:58] in a cage what was in the cage
[35:01] false doctrine and false understanding
[35:03] and misunderstanding of god in his word
[35:05] that was a cage that caves the eagles
[35:07] but at the opening of the seven seals
[35:09] there is no more cage for the eagles
[35:11] you can come out of the cage and be free
[35:16] raised from the dead now right now
[35:20] raised from the dead into the new life
[35:21] of jesus christ
[35:28] hallelujah
[35:30] now we find out that they were the
[35:32] guards to the mercy seat
[35:35] they watched the mercy seat nothing came
[35:36] to it or crossed over the tribes first
[35:39] before it could get to the mercy seat
[35:41] every man
[35:42] willing to give his life every israelite
[35:46] and camp would die
[35:48] before anything can enter into that camp
[35:50] over there and take that mercy seat
[35:53] you see in the example that brother
[35:56] branham is giving us
[35:58] he's showing us that when when the
[36:01] the camp was set up in israel in the
[36:04] days of moses and
[36:05] and he put the tribes in order he said
[36:08] now
[36:09] it wasn't just the standard of the eagle
[36:12] of
[36:12] dan that kept away the enemies and kept
[36:15] the path clear for those who had a right
[36:17] to the ark
[36:18] but it was the individuals within that
[36:20] camp themselves
[36:22] it was the people in that tribe they
[36:24] were responsible
[36:26] in their position in their positional
[36:28] place they had to be in their place
[36:30] because you know not everybody can just
[36:31] decide to move about in the camp
[36:34] they can't just decide to camp anywhere
[36:36] they want and decide well i mean
[36:38] the sun's kind of hot here in the
[36:39] morning but there's a rock over here
[36:41] i want to camp and put my tent over here
[36:43] you can't do that
[36:44] because they were set in order for a
[36:46] purpose and the order they were set in
[36:48] was for the purpose of keeping the way
[36:50] to the mercy seat every way had to be
[36:54] blocked north south east and west it had
[36:56] to be set up
[36:57] and you had to be in your position so
[36:59] that you could keep the way so that you
[37:00] could guard the path
[37:02] to the mercy seat amen
[37:06] god put us in this age for a reason
[37:09] he didn't put all of his elect in
[37:11] luther's age he didn't put them all in
[37:13] wesley's age
[37:14] but he divided them out because there's
[37:15] a certain camp that we need to be in
[37:17] because there was already somebody that
[37:19] guarded the way from the east and
[37:20] already somebody that guarded the way
[37:22] from the west
[37:22] and the way from the south has already
[37:24] been guarded but today is the day of
[37:26] guarding the path from the north amen
[37:29] and we've been placed here in this age
[37:31] in
[37:32] every israelite every man
[37:36] was willing to give his life
[37:41] are you willing to give your life to
[37:43] keep the way of the tree of life
[37:46] because the only way that you could
[37:47] effectively keep this way
[37:49] is if you give up your life you have to
[37:52] come to absolute death to self
[37:54] you have to come to a full surrender and
[37:55] be born again by the life of jesus
[37:57] christ
[37:58] to even keep this way you have to be
[38:00] anointed by the eagle anointing
[38:02] positionally placed in your inheritance
[38:04] so that you can keep the way
[38:07] hallelujah every man was willing to give
[38:11] his life
[38:16] hallelujah
[38:18] revelation 3 20 behold i stand at the
[38:21] door and knock
[38:23] if any man hear my voice
[38:27] and open the door i will come into him
[38:29] and will sup with him
[38:31] and he with me
[38:35] the only way in the last church age
[38:38] the only way that you can open the door
[38:41] and have jesus come in and sup with you
[38:43] is if you hear his voice
[38:47] no man ever shot god at any time when
[38:50] adam fell
[38:51] he didn't run to god amen adam went ran
[38:53] and hid he made himself a false religion
[38:55] of fig leaves
[38:56] hiding out from god amen we recognize
[38:59] now that it
[39:00] was god who came looking for man and it
[39:02] was god who came and knocked on your
[39:04] door
[39:04] with his voice and the only way that you
[39:07] can commune with god is not when you go
[39:09] hunting him
[39:10] up not when you imagine a fairy tale god
[39:12] and go seeking after
[39:14] him but the only way that you can ever
[39:16] commune with god
[39:17] is when you hear his voice knocking at
[39:19] your heart
[39:20] and then you through free will open the
[39:22] door and invite him in
[39:24] and then he's promised he would come in
[39:25] and sup with you
[39:27] so we live in the last age this is the
[39:29] laodicean church age when he says this
[39:31] he says behold i stand at the door and
[39:33] knock if any man hear my voice
[39:36] amen what is that voice it's the same
[39:39] voice that was speaking in the prophet
[39:41] brother branham
[39:42] it's the same voice it's the voice of
[39:44] god
[39:48] revelation 6 7 and when he opened the
[39:50] fourth seal i heard the
[39:52] voice of the fourth beast say come and
[39:55] see
[39:56] it didn't say he heard the fourth beast
[39:59] he heard the voice of the fourth beast
[40:03] amen because when brother branham was
[40:05] here he was an
[40:06] eagle and when he was here on earth it
[40:08] was the voice of the fourth beast
[40:10] speaking through the prophet messenger
[40:13] it was the voice of god it was the voice
[40:16] of the son of man
[40:17] amen speaking through a son of man it
[40:19] was the great prophet speaking through a
[40:21] prophet
[40:22] it was the great eagle speaking through
[40:23] an eagle but what we heard was the voice
[40:26] of the fourth beast
[40:28] we didn't hear the voice of william
[40:29] branham we heard the voice of the fourth
[40:31] beast
[40:32] and we heard the voice of him knocking
[40:35] at your door amen
[40:36] you can open the door
[40:39] praise god i like what comes next
[40:44] church age book laodicean church age
[40:47] a moment remember we're in the same
[40:49] church ages and behold i stand at the
[40:50] door and knock
[40:51] the same church age as the fourth seal
[40:53] the voice
[40:54] of the fourth beast we've got that now
[40:57] he's talking laodicean church agent of
[40:59] the church age book
[41:00] a momentary consideration of the church
[41:02] history will prove how accurate this
[41:03] thought is
[41:04] in the dark ages the word was almost
[41:06] entirely lost to the people
[41:08] but god sent luther with the word
[41:11] the lutheran spoke for god at that time
[41:13] but they organized and again
[41:15] pure word was lost for organization
[41:17] tends towards dogma and creeds and not
[41:19] simple word they could no longer speak
[41:21] for god
[41:22] then god sent wesley and he was the
[41:24] voice with the word
[41:26] in his day what was wesley the voice
[41:30] with the word in his day
[41:33] amen now remember luther and wesley
[41:37] are under the same anointing of man
[41:42] so the man anointing doesn't have to
[41:45] speak through one voice
[41:48] luther was the voice and wesley was the
[41:51] voice
[41:52] both of the man age anointing we got
[41:55] that
[41:55] it doesn't have to be bound all up in
[41:57] one man
[42:02] amen let's read that again
[42:07] but the the lutheran spoke for god at
[42:09] one time but they organized
[42:11] and again the pure word was lost
[42:13] skipping down they could no longer speak
[42:15] for god
[42:16] then god how come they can no longer
[42:18] speak for god because they didn't have
[42:19] his word
[42:20] when they had his revealed word they
[42:22] could speak for god but when they got
[42:24] off the word they couldn't speak for god
[42:27] so god raised up another one and gave
[42:28] her revelation then god sent wesley
[42:30] and he was the voice with the word in
[42:33] his day
[42:33] the people who took his revelation from
[42:35] god became the living epistles
[42:38] read and known of all men for their
[42:39] generation so the ones who took the word
[42:41] from wesley
[42:42] became the living word
[42:46] amen living epistles read and known of
[42:49] all men
[42:49] and now those who would take the voice
[42:52] was coming through wesley they would
[42:53] take the voice
[42:54] they themselves became a voice because
[42:57] they became a written epistle
[42:58] that everybody could read their lives
[43:00] what were they living they were living
[43:02] the word that came through the voice
[43:04] that came through wesley
[43:06] and now when they would live it
[43:08] everybody could read
[43:09] their lives and they were hearing the
[43:11] voice
[43:15] hallelujah became the living epistles
[43:18] reading known of all men for their
[43:20] generation
[43:21] when the method has failed god raised up
[43:23] others and so it has gone on through the
[43:24] years until in the last day
[43:26] there was again another people in the
[43:28] land who under
[43:29] their messenger will be the final voice
[43:33] to the final age yes sir
[43:36] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[43:39] of god
[43:40] it's its own mouthpiece why because
[43:42] they're speaking their own word
[43:45] if you don't speak the word of god you
[43:46] can't be the mouthpiece of god
[43:48] it's his own mouth be so god is turning
[43:50] on her he will confound her through the
[43:53] prophet and the bride
[43:54] for the voice of god will be in
[43:58] her
[44:04] is the mercy seat guarded today
[44:07] there a voice still knocking on the door
[44:09] today where is that voice that voice
[44:12] is in her is the voice knocking at the
[44:16] door of hearts
[44:16] it's the voice of the fourth beast amen
[44:19] it's it's the same voice as the voice of
[44:21] the eagle
[44:22] anointing in her yes it is for it says
[44:24] in the last chapter revelation verse 17
[44:27] the spirit and the bride say come
[44:30] once more the world will hear direct
[44:34] from
[44:34] god as at pentecost
[44:38] now you got that friends once more the
[44:40] world will hear direct
[44:42] from god
[44:47] this is pretty important
[44:51] because this
[44:54] is guarding the mercy seat
[44:58] this voice in the bride she can only be
[45:01] the voice if she's speaking the pure
[45:03] word if she's not speaking the pure word
[45:05] she cannot be the voice of god
[45:08] she cannot be god's mouthpiece but if
[45:10] she'll say what the prophet says and say
[45:12] what the tapes say
[45:13] and then she'll stay true to the word
[45:15] then she is the voice of god in this age
[45:18] amen and she is keeping the way to the
[45:20] tree of life
[45:22] do you realize that if your voices are
[45:24] stopped today
[45:25] then there's nobody else going to find
[45:27] their way to the tree of life
[45:29] there's nobody else can find their way
[45:31] to the mercy seat because there's got to
[45:32] be a people amen
[45:34] of the eagle tribe of the tribe of dan
[45:36] that's in position in the last day
[45:38] that everyone would give their lives to
[45:41] keep the way of the tree of life pure
[45:46] the lord
[45:50] the apostle paul says in second
[45:51] corinthians 5
[45:53] verse 17 therefore if any man be in
[45:55] christ he's a new creature
[45:56] old things are passed away behold all
[45:58] things are become new
[46:00] and all things are of god who has
[46:01] reconciled us to himself
[46:03] by jesus christ and have given to us the
[46:05] ministry
[46:06] of reconciliation now i want you to
[46:08] watch the pattern carefully
[46:10] first you have to be a new creature in
[46:12] christ
[46:14] step one you must become a new creature
[46:17] in christ
[46:18] and in all things are become new and all
[46:21] things are of god who is reconciled to
[46:24] us reconciled us to himself by jesus
[46:27] christ
[46:28] so the first step amen is you have to be
[46:31] reconciled
[46:32] back to god by jesus christ and when
[46:35] you're reconciled back to god
[46:37] then he gives you the ministry of
[46:40] reconciliation
[46:43] to wit that god was in christ
[46:44] reconciling the world unto himself
[46:46] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[46:49] and hath committed
[46:50] unto us the word of reconciliation
[46:53] now then we our ambassadors for christ
[46:57] what does an ambassador do in another
[46:59] country an ambassador becomes the voice
[47:02] of his country an ambassador becomes the
[47:05] voice of his president
[47:06] he's following out the president's
[47:08] policy the pr the policy of the country
[47:10] and an ambassador in a foreign land
[47:13] becomes the representation of the other
[47:15] land he's from
[47:16] and he becomes a voice he can speak for
[47:18] the whole country
[47:23] and we are ambassadors we have been made
[47:26] why by being reconciled back to god
[47:28] through christ
[47:29] by becoming a new creature through the
[47:30] new birth we become ambassadors amen
[47:34] for christ as though god did beseech you
[47:37] by us
[47:38] so he now paul's breaking this down
[47:40] don't lose this because of the
[47:41] terminology
[47:42] he says now we've become christ god was
[47:45] in christ reconciling the world to
[47:47] himself
[47:48] so the world's been reconciled back
[47:49] we've been reconciled back
[47:51] and now we are the ambassadors now we're
[47:54] the ones
[47:54] given the ministry of reconciliation
[47:58] why because jesus christ is not here in
[48:00] his fleshly body
[48:02] amen he is here in bride form
[48:08] and now when we are ambassadors for
[48:09] christ as though god
[48:11] did beseech you by us god is beseeching
[48:15] you
[48:15] by us
[48:19] we pray you in christ's dead
[48:22] be ye reconciled to god
[48:25] basically what he's saying is i'm
[48:28] imploring you
[48:29] i'm asking you in the place of christ
[48:32] if christ were here he would say what
[48:33] i'm saying if christ were here he would
[48:35] do what i'm doing
[48:36] but i'm an ambassador of christ i've
[48:38] been reconciled back
[48:39] i'm a new creature i'm from the other
[48:41] land and now i've been given i'm an
[48:43] ambassador and i've been given the
[48:44] ministry of reconciliation and now
[48:47] i implore you i pray you in the place of
[48:49] christ
[48:50] be reconciled back to god do you realize
[48:53] friends
[48:53] if if paul the apostle is not here going
[48:56] to the gentiles
[48:57] the gentiles never would have been
[48:58] reconciled back to god because he's the
[49:00] one called to do
[49:01] he's the voice for that age he's coming
[49:03] out under under an anointing of a lion
[49:06] anointing and he becomes the voice for
[49:07] that age
[49:08] and if he's not there as an ambassador
[49:10] of christ who's getting reconciled
[49:13] because jesus christ had already come
[49:14] and reconciled and left
[49:16] and given a ministry of reconciliation
[49:18] to the church and now the church
[49:20] in christ is praying or imploring or
[49:23] encouraging people to be reconciled to
[49:25] god
[49:28] now do you see your job now you
[49:31] in christ's dead are imploring people or
[49:34] praying people to be reconciled to god
[49:37] who is it giving an invitation in this
[49:39] day who is it
[49:42] who who knows the path the way to the
[49:46] tree of life
[49:47] who is it that is guarding and keeping
[49:49] the doctrine amen
[49:50] what is guarding the path brother
[49:52] branham demonstrated what it what a
[49:53] guarding the mercy seat was
[49:55] it was when he was standing there in
[49:56] chicago in front of 300 ministers that
[49:59] disagreed with his doctrine
[50:00] he was standing there guarding the mercy
[50:03] seat so that you and i could find our
[50:05] way to the tree of life
[50:07] amen if he hadn't guarded it where would
[50:09] we go which one of these 300 ministers
[50:11] were right
[50:14] man it's all an antichrist system to
[50:15] bring confusion and plug up and stop up
[50:18] the way to the tree of life
[50:20] to make it a maze of confusion so nobody
[50:22] would find their way to the tree of life
[50:24] but there is a man with a voice of the
[50:26] fourth beast
[50:27] standing there in front of 300 ministers
[50:30] keeping the way to the tree of life
[50:33] and not only that but by being
[50:35] reconciled back to the great eagle
[50:37] you've become
[50:38] eagles in the eagle age and the ministry
[50:40] of reconciliation has been given to you
[50:44] now the voice of the fourth beast is
[50:46] where the voice of the fourth beast is
[50:48] in her she is the mouthpiece of god
[50:53] she is the one knocking on the door she
[50:55] is the one imploring praying that you be
[50:58] reconciled back to god
[51:01] nobody else on earth has this ministry
[51:04] of reconciliation
[51:07] nobody else on earth is under the eagle
[51:09] anointing
[51:11] nobody nowhere else is the voice of god
[51:14] speaking but through the bride who's
[51:17] been reconciled back to god
[51:21] in every israelite every man
[51:25] would give his life to keep the way
[51:28] to the tree of life brother branham gave
[51:32] his life
[51:34] to keep the way to the tree of life
[51:37] the question is will you give your life
[51:40] to keep the way of the tree of life we
[51:43] saw what it looked like
[51:45] when a man would keep give his life in
[51:48] his positional placement
[51:50] to keep the path open to guard the path
[51:53] back to the tree of life
[51:54] we saw what it looked like we saw the
[51:56] suffering we saw the rejection we saw
[51:58] the heartache
[51:59] we saw the highs and we saw the lows and
[52:01] we saw a man completely surrendered to
[52:04] the holy spirit
[52:04] totally sold out to god with zero
[52:07] compromise in his life
[52:08] any time he made a mistake quickly come
[52:10] to repentance
[52:12] what was he doing he was keeping the way
[52:14] to the tree of life
[52:16] now the question is not what did he do
[52:20] because the mercy seat has to be guarded
[52:21] today there has to be a path kept open
[52:24] to the mercy seat today
[52:26] for your neighbor for your son for your
[52:28] daughter for your friend
[52:29] and there's got to be a way kept amen
[52:31] and there's got to be a people on earth
[52:33] that would sell out their lives
[52:35] to keep this way pure and what is
[52:37] keeping the way pure
[52:38] keeping the doctrine keeping the word
[52:40] pure
[52:42] keeping it without compromise keeping it
[52:44] out without man's ideas
[52:46] keeping the word is keeping the way
[52:49] keeping the word is guarding the mercy
[52:51] seat
[52:55] that's why the devil always comes in as
[52:56] a white horse to bring compromise
[52:58] because that's when he starts to pollute
[53:00] the way
[53:03] the question i ask is who can find their
[53:06] way to the mercy seat
[53:07] through the path that you live
[53:12] this is a question for all of us we take
[53:15] this home
[53:17] can somebody watch my life
[53:21] and find their way to the mercy seat
[53:24] can somebody hear the voice of my life
[53:27] thundering
[53:28] out or is my life just as confusing
[53:31] confusion as 300 ministers and their
[53:34] different ideas
[53:35] do i have my own idea on what the
[53:37] prophet said do i play around with his
[53:39] opinions
[53:40] and write stuff off and begin to accept
[53:42] my own way
[53:43] am i making the path obscure or am i
[53:46] keeping it clear
[53:49] because the prophet showed us how to
[53:51] keep the path amen and
[53:52] you know what the israelites they would
[53:55] they would sell out their lives amen
[53:57] to keep this bath clear they would die
[54:00] so that their children and their
[54:01] neighbors and their friends would have a
[54:03] path back to the tree of life
[54:05] are you willing to die so that your
[54:07] children and your neighbor and your
[54:08] friends have a path back to the tree of
[54:09] life
[54:10] are you willing to give up everything
[54:12] that you think is right and take god's
[54:13] way
[54:14] are you willing to take the prophet for
[54:16] what he is an example to the world
[54:19] amen brother branham said that a prophet
[54:21] becomes
[54:22] he literally becomes the word for his
[54:25] age
[54:26] he said his life his life becomes the
[54:29] word for this age
[54:31] god would take his prophets and do
[54:32] strange things with them because their
[54:34] life
[54:34] was an actual sign and an example to the
[54:37] people
[54:40] and he says their life became a
[54:43] prophet's life became the word to the
[54:46] age
[54:50] that's why you're on dangerous ground
[54:52] when you start talking about brother
[54:53] branham's opinion
[54:57] how do you know it's his opinion how do
[54:59] you know the lord didn't show him that
[55:01] how do you know it's not revealed to him
[55:04] amen
[55:05] his life becomes
[55:08] the word to the age so that you can
[55:12] watch his life
[55:13] and that becomes the word to the age
[55:17] do we understand what i'm saying we have
[55:20] an
[55:20] obligation in this age under the eagle
[55:22] anointing to keep
[55:24] that path to guard that path back to the
[55:27] tree of life
[55:28] oh it's easy to talk we can talk and
[55:30] talk and talk and talk but people don't
[55:32] care what you say
[55:33] they care about what you do the
[55:34] demonstration of your life is leaving a
[55:36] path for somebody to follow
[55:38] you can witness to somebody all you want
[55:40] but if your life is in chaos
[55:42] and your family is in a total wreck and
[55:43] everything in your life is upside down
[55:45] they're not going to pay a bit of
[55:47] attention to you amen if at work you
[55:49] live a different life than you live at
[55:50] home
[55:51] in a home you live a live different life
[55:52] than you live at church who in the world
[55:54] is going to follow the path that you're
[55:56] leaving
[55:58] it can't be a path laid down in
[55:59] hypocrisy it's got to be absolutely sold
[56:02] out where every man in this tribe of dan
[56:04] under the eagle anointing would give his
[56:06] life to keep that way to the mercy seat
[56:12] brother branham said in this message
[56:17] and then jesus came you know friends
[56:19] jesus never said go into all the world
[56:21] and build churches
[56:22] that they're all right never said go
[56:24] build schools they're all right
[56:25] but where we failed he said preach the
[56:27] gospel
[56:29] the gospel isn't building churches or
[56:31] schools through the though they're fine
[56:32] but the gospel come not in word only but
[56:35] through power
[56:36] and demonstration of the holy ghost
[56:39] you got that the gospel came he said
[56:42] preach the gospel
[56:43] but the gospel came by power and
[56:46] demonstration
[56:47] of the holy spirit and if you can't
[56:49] preach a gospel with power
[56:51] and demonstration of the holy of the
[56:53] holy spirit then you're not preaching
[56:54] the gospel
[56:59] this is what he said but through the
[57:00] power and demonstration of the holy
[57:01] spirit is the gospel
[57:03] it's a living gospel not enchanting
[57:06] words i'm going to take my code off for
[57:09] that one
[57:11] it's a living gospel friends living in
[57:14] your flesh
[57:16] not enchanting words amen people
[57:20] talk big all the time and they get in
[57:21] the right crowd and
[57:24] i just turned my microphone off they get
[57:27] in the right crowd and all of a sudden
[57:28] they're godly and they're living for god
[57:30] and they talk about scriptures and talk
[57:32] about how good the message is
[57:33] and you just put them into another crowd
[57:35] then all of a sudden you would never
[57:36] know they're a message believer you ever
[57:38] just talk about whatever's going on that
[57:40] crowd and drink a little bit and hang
[57:41] out in places they shouldn't hang out
[57:42] and talk about foolish things
[57:44] what's going on that's absolutely
[57:46] nothing but an antichrist spirit
[57:48] to plug up the way to the tree of life
[57:52] and god came with the power of the holy
[57:54] ghost to purge us from those things
[57:56] to bring us back and open up a way so
[57:58] that we can be a final voice to the
[58:00] final age that his voice will be in her
[58:03] and it will be the same voice that
[58:04] knocked on your heart is the same voice
[58:06] that'll be knocking on somebody else's
[58:08] heart
[58:10] hallelujah
[58:13] it's a living gospel not enchanting
[58:15] words
[58:16] but a living faith in the lord who is
[58:19] alive forever or
[58:20] ever more among us now if he's alive
[58:23] as the bible says he is and he made a
[58:25] promise
[58:26] that he was the same yesterday today and
[58:28] forever the things that he did
[58:30] we would do also hallelujah
[58:34] you believe that friends that's the true
[58:36] gospel
[58:38] brother paul the apostle says first the
[58:40] lessons first thessalonians 1 5
[58:42] for our gospel came not unto you in word
[58:44] only but also in power
[58:46] and in the holy ghost and in much
[58:48] assurance as you know what manner of men
[58:50] we were among you for your sakes
[58:53] now the question is
[58:57] is our gospel in word only
[59:01] but do we preach the same gospel paul
[59:03] preached
[59:04] brother branham could come and he could
[59:06] say i preached the same
[59:08] gospel paul preached because it had the
[59:11] same demonstration and power of the holy
[59:13] ghost
[59:14] it had the same power to absolutely
[59:15] renovate somebody's life
[59:17] it had the same power to take away
[59:19] addiction it had the same power to turn
[59:20] somebody's life upside down
[59:22] and change them from a sinner to a saint
[59:24] what was it the word that he preached
[59:28] the word that he preached carried with
[59:29] it life and when it was received and the
[59:31] baptism the holy ghost came
[59:33] it absolutely produced its own life
[59:37] and it came with power paul says in
[59:41] first corinthians two verse four
[59:43] and my speech and my preaching was not
[59:45] with enticing words
[59:46] of man's wisdom but in demonstration of
[59:49] the spirit
[59:50] and of power
[59:53] that your faith should not stand in the
[59:55] wisdom of men
[59:56] but in the power of god
[1:00:00] hallelujah i got invited
[1:00:03] by saint ritas to come to a opiate
[1:00:07] addiction program and they invited every
[1:00:09] pastor in the area it's going to be the
[1:00:11] end of october
[1:00:12] and i'm very likely to go
[1:00:16] and they want to talk about the opium
[1:00:18] and heroin addiction crisis
[1:00:20] and there's a medical doctor from the
[1:00:21] pain management clinic who's going to be
[1:00:23] speaking to all of these ministers
[1:00:25] and i'm reading this letter thinking
[1:00:27] what in the world
[1:00:28] can a pain doctor tell all of these
[1:00:31] preachers
[1:00:32] about how to help people with opiate and
[1:00:35] heroin addiction
[1:00:37] is this a holy ghost-filled doctor with
[1:00:39] an anointing that can lay hands on the
[1:00:41] sick and they recover
[1:00:42] is he going to tell him that there's a
[1:00:44] power in the word of god to deliver from
[1:00:46] opiate addiction
[1:00:47] is he going to tell him that there's a
[1:00:49] demonstration and power of the holy
[1:00:50] ghost that if you'll come the word way
[1:00:52] to the mercy seat
[1:00:53] and find mercy from god you can be
[1:00:55] completely renovated and change and your
[1:00:57] addiction can go away
[1:00:58] by the power of the holy ghost is that
[1:01:00] what that doctor is going to tell them
[1:01:01] preachers
[1:01:02] because the preacher should be teaching
[1:01:04] the doctor how to deal with opiate
[1:01:05] addiction
[1:01:06] not the doctor teaching the preachers
[1:01:09] and if i get a chance to tell them i'm
[1:01:11] going to let them know in a nice way
[1:01:14] why would a bunch of preachers go find
[1:01:17] out how to handle opiate addiction from
[1:01:18] a pain management doctor
[1:01:20] all he's going to do is prescribe
[1:01:21] something else more pills with more
[1:01:24] demon powers to offset another demon
[1:01:26] power
[1:01:26] and create more problems than he's going
[1:01:27] to fix the power is in the power of the
[1:01:30] holy ghost
[1:01:31] which is the true gospel and the true
[1:01:34] gospel has to have a power that backs it
[1:01:36] up
[1:01:36] or it's not the gospel it's got to be
[1:01:39] believed by
[1:01:40] faith brothers and sisters we don't talk
[1:01:43] about it we don't
[1:01:44] we don't just imitate it but we believe
[1:01:46] it and we hold fast to it and we expect
[1:01:48] it to bring results amen
[1:01:50] if you're struggling with compromise in
[1:01:52] your life it's the power of the holy
[1:01:54] ghost that'll burn that out
[1:01:55] not a 12-step system not getting better
[1:01:57] now you fixing yourself
[1:01:59] it is the power of the holy ghost that
[1:02:01] comes when you fully surrender to the
[1:02:03] full word of god
[1:02:04] and if you hear the prophet of god say
[1:02:06] you say i believe it
[1:02:07] i want to do it god you've got to help
[1:02:09] me because i'm without power
[1:02:12] he never said you had to have the power
[1:02:14] he said the power was in the holy ghost
[1:02:19] we've got to keep the path straight to
[1:02:21] the mercy seat
[1:02:23] we've got to preach the gospel the same
[1:02:25] way paul preached it
[1:02:26] the same way brother branham preached it
[1:02:28] without compromise without compromising
[1:02:30] our life without compromising with
[1:02:32] worldly ideas
[1:02:33] but keep it straight friends hallelujah
[1:02:38] brother branham said in christ is the
[1:02:39] mystery of god revealed
[1:02:41] now listen he's talking about christ the
[1:02:44] mystery of god revealed
[1:02:46] but he's going to spend most of his time
[1:02:47] talking about you
[1:02:50] because you are part of christ the
[1:02:53] mystery of god revealed
[1:02:58] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:02:59] his presence in the individual
[1:03:02] with a personal vindication of himself
[1:03:04] expressing himself
[1:03:06] the living word that's promised for the
[1:03:08] day
[1:03:09] so what's the living word that's
[1:03:10] promised for the day well the living
[1:03:13] word is promised for the day is
[1:03:14] revelation 10 7 and malachi 4. no he's
[1:03:17] after that now and he's preaching christ
[1:03:20] as the mystery of god revealed
[1:03:21] and he's preaching the one mystery of
[1:03:23] god that's in revelation 10
[1:03:24] 7 that will be finished and that mystery
[1:03:27] is christ
[1:03:29] the mystery of god revealed
[1:03:33] so let's get this again so we don't get
[1:03:35] lost he's not talking about malachi 4 5.
[1:03:38] he's not talking about revelation 10 7.
[1:03:40] amen he's talking about something beyond
[1:03:43] that he said
[1:03:47] his presence in the individual with a
[1:03:49] personal vindication of himself
[1:03:52] expressing himself the living word
[1:03:56] that's promised for the day
[1:04:00] expressing itself through you
[1:04:05] the living word that's promised for this
[1:04:07] day
[1:04:08] is not what was expressed through
[1:04:10] william branham
[1:04:13] but it's what's expressed through you
[1:04:18] expressing itself through a vindication
[1:04:22] of the great revelation of god
[1:04:25] what is the great revelation of god
[1:04:27] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:04:28] what's the vindication of it his life
[1:04:30] living through you
[1:04:31] is a vindication of the great revelation
[1:04:33] in this day
[1:04:35] if what brother branham taught us is
[1:04:36] true then that life of jesus christ has
[1:04:38] got to be on display
[1:04:40] in the believers
[1:04:43] look only in an individual never a group
[1:04:45] an individual not in a group
[1:04:47] his identification is with an individual
[1:04:49] you get that
[1:04:50] not with the mess that is not what the
[1:04:52] baptist not with the presbyterian not
[1:04:53] the lutheran not the pentecostal
[1:04:55] but as an individual i'll take one and
[1:04:58] i'll leave one i'll separate them that's
[1:05:00] right there'll be two in the field
[1:05:02] i'll take one and leave one there'll be
[1:05:04] two in bed and i'll take one and leave
[1:05:05] one
[1:05:06] it's not a group it's a personal
[1:05:07] vindication of a pregnant child of god
[1:05:14] if you're pregnant it won't take very
[1:05:16] long for that to be vindicated
[1:05:20] you can't say i'm pregnant and six
[1:05:21] months later i'm pregnant and then eight
[1:05:23] months later i'm pregnant
[1:05:24] and there's no vindication of you being
[1:05:26] pregnant
[1:05:28] people would have a right to question
[1:05:31] your pregnancy
[1:05:34] but if you're truly pregnated it won't
[1:05:36] take long for people will begin to
[1:05:38] notice there's something different about
[1:05:40] you
[1:05:40] i can't put my finger on it but there's
[1:05:42] something a little different about you
[1:05:44] and you give it a little more time and
[1:05:46] all of a sudden they catch a revelation
[1:05:48] oh you're expecting
[1:05:51] because when you become pregnant it'll
[1:05:53] vindicate itself
[1:05:55] because when you become pregnant the
[1:05:56] natural types of spiritual when you
[1:05:58] become pregnant
[1:05:59] it actually changes your life it changes
[1:06:02] the way you look
[1:06:03] it changes the way you think it changes
[1:06:05] the way you feel it changes the way you
[1:06:07] eat
[1:06:07] when you become pregnant it changes your
[1:06:10] life you don't change your life
[1:06:12] the pregnancy changes your life
[1:06:17] can you imagine a poor woman trying to
[1:06:19] imitate that she's pregnant and having
[1:06:21] false cravings and and all of a sudden
[1:06:23] oh my back hurts and i can't sleep on my
[1:06:25] side
[1:06:25] she's not pregnant at all that's just a
[1:06:27] put on that's just a bunch of hypocrisy
[1:06:29] you don't have to put anything on when
[1:06:31] you're a child of god pregnant by the
[1:06:32] word of god
[1:06:33] when you do the pregnation takes over
[1:06:36] your life
[1:06:38] then everything that's supposed to come
[1:06:39] comes
[1:06:42] you don't have to say oh i should be
[1:06:44] growing a little larger
[1:06:46] don't worry you're going to get larger
[1:06:49] i i should i've heard about different
[1:06:52] cravings i
[1:06:53] i should don't worry it'll come people
[1:06:56] told me about pain in my back or not
[1:06:58] being able to take a full breath
[1:06:59] or not being able to lay on this side or
[1:07:01] that side or i can't lay on my stomach
[1:07:02] hey don't worry when you just keep
[1:07:05] living in the pregnancy and it'll all
[1:07:07] manifest itself
[1:07:09] you don't have to put anything on you
[1:07:10] don't have to make believe but there's a
[1:07:12] vindication of a pregnancy in this day
[1:07:14] that there is a bride who's been
[1:07:15] impregnated with the word of god
[1:07:17] and it's showing it better be showing if
[1:07:21] it's not showing you've got to go back
[1:07:23] and get pregnant
[1:07:28] and then you don't have to do anything
[1:07:30] just keep feeding
[1:07:32] the life is going to take over
[1:07:37] it's not a group it's a personal
[1:07:39] vindication of a pregnant child of god
[1:07:41] filled with the holy ghost so
[1:07:42] surrendered to god that you don't care
[1:07:44] about anything else
[1:07:46] and the holy spirit living its life
[1:07:48] pulsating through him
[1:07:49] showing the personal vindication of the
[1:07:52] word
[1:07:53] itself not you
[1:07:56] it not you
[1:08:00] proving it it's proving itself
[1:08:05] you don't have to prove anything all you
[1:08:07] have to do is surrender and it's not a
[1:08:09] life that you live of your own
[1:08:11] but it's a life that he comes and lives
[1:08:13] through you it's a life that he will
[1:08:15] live if you just surrender
[1:08:21] personal vindication of the word itself
[1:08:23] expressing itself to the people
[1:08:25] and to the world
[1:08:29] now listen friends it doesn't do any
[1:08:33] good if we just express
[1:08:34] christ to each other you know i love
[1:08:38] seeing the expression of christ in you
[1:08:40] it does mean a load of good
[1:08:41] but god doesn't want jews just express
[1:08:43] his life back and forth to each other
[1:08:45] when jesus christ came on the earth he
[1:08:47] came and demonstrated the life of god
[1:08:49] to the world
[1:08:52] man you've got to be a believer in the
[1:08:54] world not just when you're with
[1:08:55] believers
[1:08:57] you got to be a believer at work and you
[1:08:58] got to be a believer at school and you
[1:09:00] got to be a believer with friends and
[1:09:01] family
[1:09:02] you got to be a believer everywhere
[1:09:04] you're to express to the world
[1:09:06] the life of jesus christ not just to
[1:09:08] other believers
[1:09:10] man people try such foolish things and
[1:09:13] they'll do they'll act one way and
[1:09:14] behave one way and a bunch of people at
[1:09:16] church
[1:09:16] but when they get somewhere else they'll
[1:09:18] act somewhere totally different that's
[1:09:20] not pregnation friends
[1:09:21] that's hypocrisy but pregnation it
[1:09:24] doesn't matter where you go you're
[1:09:26] pregnant
[1:09:27] and it's showing it doesn't matter where
[1:09:29] you go or what you do you're not going
[1:09:31] to hide your life because you've been
[1:09:33] made pregnant by the life of jesus
[1:09:35] christ
[1:09:35] and you can't hide it wherever you go
[1:09:37] amen when you go here and you go there
[1:09:39] it doesn't matter it's showing
[1:09:43] praise god
[1:09:47] what are we talking about keeping the
[1:09:49] way
[1:09:50] to the tree of life remember the voice
[1:09:55] is in her and if we give an
[1:09:58] uncertain sound if our lives speak
[1:10:02] uncertainty to the word of god
[1:10:04] and compromise and laodicea how will
[1:10:07] people
[1:10:08] find the path to the tree of life if
[1:10:11] we're not
[1:10:11] guarding it we have to be guarding it
[1:10:18] continuing on in christ is the mystery
[1:10:20] of god revealed it goes right by them
[1:10:22] and they don't recognize it until it's
[1:10:23] gone
[1:10:24] it only picks up the predestinated seed
[1:10:26] that god predestinated before the
[1:10:28] foundation of the earth
[1:10:29] the same thing came through in the days
[1:10:31] of noah same thing came through in the
[1:10:33] days of moses days of elijah days of the
[1:10:35] prophets days of jesus on down
[1:10:37] through into this very hour the pregnant
[1:10:40] person with the seed of god the word
[1:10:42] in there manifesting itself so
[1:10:44] surrendered to the will of god
[1:10:46] that the word and the word alone
[1:10:48] manifests itself in this person
[1:10:50] the prisoner to an individual
[1:10:54] it's the word and the word alone
[1:10:56] manifesting
[1:10:57] itself in this person
[1:11:01] we can have a lot of different things
[1:11:03] manifesting itself
[1:11:04] in a person i can come to church and
[1:11:07] raise my hands and sing and i can
[1:11:08] manifest one thing
[1:11:10] but i can go to another venue with a
[1:11:12] different crowd of people and i can
[1:11:14] manifest something totally different
[1:11:18] that shows that there's no pregnation
[1:11:22] amen you got to become
[1:11:25] pregnant by the word of god by receiving
[1:11:27] your husband
[1:11:28] the manifest word of this age the
[1:11:30] message of the hour
[1:11:32] amen you receive that you die out to
[1:11:34] yourself
[1:11:35] you make a full surrender and that
[1:11:37] pregnation will come
[1:11:38] and then you don't have to worry about
[1:11:39] it you just keep feeding and keep
[1:11:41] surrendering
[1:11:42] and it'll take completely over your life
[1:11:47] and the message go away jesus the
[1:11:49] problem says and christian is a
[1:11:51] christian because christ lives in that
[1:11:52] person
[1:11:54] that's pretty easy definition what makes
[1:11:57] you a christian a christian
[1:11:59] is a christian because christ lives in
[1:12:01] that person
[1:12:03] how many christians we got here today
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:07] not because not because you signed
[1:12:08] papers or because you came to church
[1:12:10] today
[1:12:11] but the only way you can be a christian
[1:12:12] is if christ lives in you
[1:12:15] christ means christ-like not a
[1:12:17] membership but a vindication
[1:12:20] get that not a membership not part of a
[1:12:22] club
[1:12:23] but a vindication
[1:12:26] it's got to be vindicated that means
[1:12:28] it's got to be proved it's got to be
[1:12:30] manifest it's got to be
[1:12:32] on display
[1:12:37] not a membership but a vindication god
[1:12:39] producing through you
[1:12:40] just what a christian is
[1:12:44] it's you getting out of the way and
[1:12:45] letting god come in you taking no
[1:12:47] thoughts let the mind that was in christ
[1:12:49] be in you
[1:12:50] there you are that's the real christian
[1:12:52] on my search the scripture he said
[1:12:54] they are they that testify of me
[1:12:58] now that's a big statement and we're
[1:13:00] going to labor on that for a minute
[1:13:01] jesus come and they asked him who are
[1:13:04] you and you're this and you're that he
[1:13:05] said search the scriptures they are they
[1:13:07] that testify of me
[1:13:09] can we say the same thing search the
[1:13:12] scriptures what does it say about women
[1:13:14] how should they dress
[1:13:14] how should they act towards their
[1:13:15] husbands how should men treat their
[1:13:17] wives amen how should we dedicate
[1:13:19] ourselves to the life of god
[1:13:20] what did paul say for men to do what did
[1:13:22] paul say for women to do how did paul
[1:13:23] say we should walk in this world
[1:13:25] hey search the scriptures they're the
[1:13:27] vindication of who i am
[1:13:30] amen you want to know who i am search
[1:13:32] the scriptures and find
[1:13:33] where my life doesn't match the gospel
[1:13:35] that was laid down by the apostle paul
[1:13:37] in jesus christ
[1:13:40] now we know that we're all still growing
[1:13:42] we all have these things that we're
[1:13:43] surrendering to the lord that's not what
[1:13:45] i'm talking about those things god is
[1:13:46] washing out all the time
[1:13:48] how many is growing in the lord
[1:13:50] constantly how many things is god
[1:13:52] washing out of you
[1:13:53] things that you can never get rid of on
[1:13:55] your own have been been disappearing
[1:13:56] from your life
[1:13:57] what is the washing of the water by the
[1:13:59] word amen things you can't do
[1:14:01] god just does you just keep surrendering
[1:14:03] you keep hating it you keep giving it to
[1:14:05] him
[1:14:05] and you keep feeding on the word and
[1:14:07] he's going to wash it away and wash it
[1:14:09] away
[1:14:09] and wash it away this is not about
[1:14:12] having a growing process we're
[1:14:14] all growing it's not about living
[1:14:15] absolutely perfect with no faults that's
[1:14:17] not what we're talking about but we're
[1:14:18] talking about a life that's not your
[1:14:20] life it's his life
[1:14:21] and it's a vindication of who you are
[1:14:23] your life is a vindication of who you
[1:14:26] are
[1:14:26] and you can say search the scriptures
[1:14:30] for they are they that testify of me
[1:14:33] friends it's not your confession jesus
[1:14:35] says out of the mouth the two are
[1:14:37] witnesses they may let everything be
[1:14:38] established right
[1:14:40] he says you can't just take my word for
[1:14:41] it jesus himself
[1:14:43] came to them and said you can't just
[1:14:45] take my word for it
[1:14:51] he said but my father also testifies
[1:14:55] even greater than that search the
[1:14:57] scriptures
[1:14:58] for they are they that testify of me
[1:15:01] i've got witnesses
[1:15:03] you've got witnesses one of the
[1:15:04] witnesses the scriptures themselves
[1:15:07] are testifying who you are
[1:15:12] either that or the scriptures themselves
[1:15:14] are exposing your condition
[1:15:17] but let the word either expose you or
[1:15:19] prove you
[1:15:20] amen not your own thinking and not what
[1:15:22] you feel about it and not the stroke of
[1:15:24] some kind mother
[1:15:25] or a gentle dad will say oh you'll be
[1:15:27] all right you come back to the word
[1:15:29] and if your life doesn't tote with the
[1:15:30] scriptures and you don't have a desire
[1:15:32] to match every word then you need
[1:15:34] something that'll burn your desire out
[1:15:36] and give you a desire that matches this
[1:15:38] word
[1:15:39] to where you actually want what the word
[1:15:41] says even if you're struggling with
[1:15:43] something and trying to get over it but
[1:15:45] all you want is this word to be manifest
[1:15:47] hey that's a good sign that's coming
[1:15:49] friends
[1:15:50] you keep laying there and you keep
[1:15:53] washing out by the word
[1:15:54] and god will take it away
[1:15:58] search the scriptures they are they that
[1:16:01] testify
[1:16:02] of me
[1:16:05] praise god
[1:16:13] message things that are to be now if we
[1:16:16] are those attributes of god we cannot
[1:16:18] live by creeds
[1:16:19] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:16:22] must live by the word
[1:16:24] because the bride is part of the
[1:16:26] bridegroom
[1:16:28] like any wife is part of her husband

[1:17:00] because he says it's those seven
[1:17:01] thunders that'll literally turn the
[1:17:03] hearts of the children back to the
[1:17:04] fathers and he's already preached the
[1:17:05] seven thunders

[1:17:09] saying the manifestation of the hour

[1:22:27] day
[1:22:31] and god is doing a wonderful thing in
[1:22:34] our day
[1:22:37] we have to stop looking back at what's
[1:22:40] been done
[1:22:42] and start looking at what he's doing
[1:22:46] and who he's going to do it with and who
[1:22:48] he's going to do it through
[1:22:50] we're not waiting for the prophet to
[1:22:52] come back and do some wonderful things
[1:22:55] if there's any wonderful things going to
[1:22:57] happen it's going to be right here you
[1:22:58] and i
[1:23:00] we're the vessels yielded to him we're
[1:23:01] the tools in his hand where the stones
[1:23:03] in his slang
[1:23:04] we're the only thing he's got on this
[1:23:06] earth is the bride of jesus christ
[1:23:08] we're the only thing that he's got to
[1:23:09] work with
[1:23:11] and we've got to keep it pure keep it
[1:23:13] clean amen keep the path
[1:23:15] be path open you know every time god's
[1:23:19] had a voice
[1:23:21] he's had to vindicate that voice
[1:23:25] is that right he's had to show the world
[1:23:28] this is my voice
[1:23:30] and if they heard the voice they were
[1:23:32] saved if they rejected the voice they
[1:23:33] were lost
[1:23:36] noah had was the voice in his day
[1:23:39] how was noah vindicated but like
[1:23:42] ginormous structure behind him
[1:23:45] by doing what god told him to do
[1:23:49] by building what god told him the
[1:23:50] building keeping it word for word
[1:23:52] he was displaying to the whole world the
[1:23:54] vindication that he was the voice
[1:23:59] moses was the voice and god gave him
[1:24:01] signs
[1:24:02] amen elijah was the voice in his day
[1:24:06] god vindicated it when jesus christ came
[1:24:09] he was the voice on earth in his day and
[1:24:12] god vindicated it
[1:24:13] we believe that you know jesus prayed
[1:24:17] for
[1:24:17] multitudes of people that never believed
[1:24:19] he was the messiah
[1:24:22] it would be funny it'd be it'd be odd
[1:24:24] sometimes to
[1:24:25] have that number to count how many
[1:24:27] people
[1:24:28] did jesus pray for and how many were
[1:24:30] healed
[1:24:31] that never received him as the messiah
[1:24:33] ended up rejecting him and being lost
[1:24:36] i would say the number would probably be
[1:24:37] staggering
[1:24:40] but the point of the manifestation was
[1:24:42] not to convert them
[1:24:44] the point of their healing the point of
[1:24:46] the water and the wine the point of none
[1:24:47] of that
[1:24:48] was was was to convert them it was all
[1:24:51] to draw attention to the vessel that god
[1:24:52] was using
[1:24:53] so that the elect would listen to the
[1:24:55] word and be changed by the word
[1:24:58] not by the miracle but by the word
[1:25:01] paul the apostle came absolutely same
[1:25:04] thing god vindicated everywhere he went
[1:25:06] in every city he would come to god would
[1:25:08] vindicate that this is my voice
[1:25:11] and that vindication wasn't to convert
[1:25:12] people right
[1:25:14] it was never to convert them it was
[1:25:16] always to draw attention to the voice
[1:25:18] so that the elect could hear the voice
[1:25:20] see that god backed it up
[1:25:21] listen to the voice and find the path to
[1:25:23] eternal life
[1:25:25] when brother branham came he had healing
[1:25:26] campaigns like has never been recorded
[1:25:29] in the history of the world
[1:25:30] and thousands and thousands and tens of
[1:25:32] thousands maybe
[1:25:33] hundreds of thousands of people were
[1:25:36] healed
[1:25:37] and never believed he was a prophet
[1:25:40] never accepted him as malachi 4
[1:25:42] revelation 10 7.
[1:25:44] but the point was not to convert them to
[1:25:46] believe the point was to draw attention
[1:25:49] to the voice
[1:25:53] if we're the voice if we're the final
[1:25:56] voice in the final age
[1:25:58] then what has god got to do
[1:26:02] he's got to vindicate the vessel he's
[1:26:04] using as his voice
[1:26:06] he's got to show that this is my voice
[1:26:09] how's he going to do it look at this
[1:26:11] giant arc behind me
[1:26:13] look at my life look at search the
[1:26:15] scriptures don't they tell you of who i
[1:26:17] am
[1:26:17] listen to the testimonies come and
[1:26:19] experience for yourself
[1:26:20] come and taste and see that the lord is
[1:26:22] good hey friends you shouldn't be afraid
[1:26:25] amen and you shouldn't be afraid to lay
[1:26:26] your hands on somebody and pray for them
[1:26:28] because you're a son of god
[1:26:31] if they have faith in what you're
[1:26:32] telling them but
[1:26:34] you know brother branham was told
[1:26:37] if you can get the people to believe you
[1:26:41] he was not told if you can get the
[1:26:43] people to believe the message
[1:26:45] he wasn't told he said if you can get
[1:26:47] the people to believe you
[1:26:48] then nothing will stand before your
[1:26:50] prayer not even cancer friends what will
[1:26:52] happen if you can get the people to
[1:26:53] believe you
[1:26:54] that you're the bride of jesus christ
[1:26:56] you're a redeemed son or daughter of god
[1:26:58] with the rights to lay hands on the sick
[1:27:00] and they shall recover
[1:27:01] hey hey their faith and that scripture
[1:27:03] can heal them
[1:27:04] they don't have to believe in malachi 4.
[1:27:06] they don't have to really believe in
[1:27:07] revelation 10 7
[1:27:09] their faith in that word that if they
[1:27:11] those that believe if they lay hands on
[1:27:13] the sick they shall recover
[1:27:18] i'm expecting god to fully vindicate his
[1:27:20] voice in this day
[1:27:23] i'm taking god at his word and i'm
[1:27:25] watching the pattern and god has always
[1:27:27] vindicated that voice
[1:27:28] and i'm expecting him to vindicate that
[1:27:30] voice in our day
[1:27:32] i'm not afraid to pray for anybody that
[1:27:34] will believe me and what i say about who
[1:27:36] i am
[1:27:36] and what the word says about me i'm not
[1:27:39] afraid to lay hands and pray for any of
[1:27:41] them
[1:27:43] if they can believe what i'm telling
[1:27:45] them they'll be healed
[1:27:46] will they all be converted some might
[1:27:48] some won't but it doesn't matter
[1:27:50] because god is proving his word once
[1:27:52] again friends
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:55] you know the vindication is to the world
[1:28:01] when god heals us that's the children's
[1:28:03] portion
[1:28:05] that's just the children's bread that's
[1:28:06] what we expect when god heals us
[1:28:08] it's not as though you know when dave
[1:28:11] wood comes to the prayer line and also
[1:28:13] he's got a mass
[1:28:14] amen and then he goes they go back for
[1:28:16] the surgery and there's no mass anymore
[1:28:18] it's not like dave all the sudden says
[1:28:19] oh now i know god's real
[1:28:23] he already knew god was real not now i
[1:28:25] know i'm a son of god he already knew he
[1:28:26] was the son of god
[1:28:27] or i know he loves me he already knew he
[1:28:29] loved him he was expecting for god to
[1:28:31] keep his word
[1:28:34] healing is no vindication to the bride
[1:28:39] that's the children's portion it's not
[1:28:42] as though
[1:28:42] god heals your body oh now i know he's
[1:28:45] god
[1:28:46] now i know he's my father and i know he
[1:28:49] loves me you should have known that
[1:28:50] before he healed you
[1:28:53] that's just the children's bread i said
[1:28:55] the other night at youth meeting
[1:28:57] my children when i when my wife goes and
[1:28:59] buys groceries and i give her money
[1:29:01] and she brings them home we have a meal
[1:29:03] and then they don't all of a sudden sit
[1:29:05] down and eat the meal go
[1:29:06] now i know daddy loves me
[1:29:10] and i know that i'm his and i know he
[1:29:12] cares about me
[1:29:13] they should have already known that
[1:29:15] before they ate the meal that's just
[1:29:17] their portion
[1:29:18] that's their right because they belong
[1:29:20] to me that's my
[1:29:22] duty to take care of them that's all
[1:29:24] healing is for us
[1:29:25] it's not a vindication to us but it is a
[1:29:27] vindication to the world
[1:29:29] and i fully expect with all of my heart
[1:29:32] that god if we can have faith like this
[1:29:34] that god will prove his word once again
[1:29:36] and god will vindicate
[1:29:38] the vessel if you can get people to
[1:29:40] believe you
[1:29:43] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:29:44] not even cancer
[1:29:46] that's the pattern friends and this word
[1:29:49] is to be vindicated
[1:29:50] to the world do you believe it
[1:29:56] are we ready to give our lives for it
[1:30:00] you're the ones in the tribe of dan
[1:30:03] on the sides of the north in the final
[1:30:07] church age
[1:30:08] just beyond laodicea you're the one
[1:30:12] keeping the way to the tree of life
[1:30:16] cutting out anything that's not godly
[1:30:18] keeping it open
[1:30:20] and waving in those that are coming the
[1:30:23] right way the blood way the elect of god
[1:30:25] fanning them in i can't think of
[1:30:28] anything else i'd rather be doing in
[1:30:29] this life
[1:30:31] than that that's your eternal purpose on
[1:30:33] this planet
[1:30:34] no matter what your position is in the
[1:30:36] church or what your job or occupation
[1:30:37] man or woman boy or girl
[1:30:39] that's your position in the tribe of dan
[1:30:42] under the banner of eagle standing there
[1:30:44] keeping the way to the tree of life
[1:30:47] and i say god thank you for putting me
[1:30:49] here in this day
[1:30:51] and i fully expect that you'll do
[1:30:52] everything that you said you would do
[1:30:55] and i believe it lord let's all stand
[1:30:59] musicians if you could come please
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:12] that's bower heads
[1:31:16] if you're here this morning
[1:31:20] and during the preaching you realize i
[1:31:23] love the lord with all of my heart
[1:31:26] and i want that vindication of a life
[1:31:29] from the scriptures
[1:31:31] but i have not completely sold out
[1:31:34] i'm still playing with things that get
[1:31:37] my affection i'm still
[1:31:38] toying with things that i like and i'm
[1:31:40] still living with one foot in one foot
[1:31:42] out
[1:31:44] i'm here to tell you do not have to live
[1:31:46] that way
[1:31:48] you may have tried in the past and
[1:31:50] failed you may have wanted to do right
[1:31:52] and fail
[1:31:53] but what you need is a death what you
[1:31:57] need is a full surrender and a death
[1:31:59] and you need to be burnt out by the
[1:32:01] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:03] and you need to be made a new creature
[1:32:06] and i'd invite you in your seat right
[1:32:07] now
[1:32:08] if that's your condition just slip your
[1:32:11] hand up to god and say god you know my
[1:32:13] heart
[1:32:14] and i've failed but i don't want to fail
[1:32:16] again
[1:32:17] i don't have the power but you've
[1:32:20] promised that there'll be a power
[1:32:21] that'll come to make me a new creature
[1:32:23] in christ jesus
[1:32:25] and i invite you just to sell everything
[1:32:27] out and quit playing and quit holding on
[1:32:30] this world is soon going to burn and
[1:32:32] everything is going to burn in it
[1:32:34] everything that catches your attention
[1:32:36] everything that divides your affection
[1:32:38] it's all going to die it's all going to
[1:32:40] burn it's all going to become rubbish
[1:32:42] but there's only one thing that matters
[1:32:45] and that's that life that we live for
[1:32:46] jesus christ
[1:32:48] lord i pray that you see the hands lord
[1:32:50] and that you would burn out
[1:32:52] burn out those old natures lord destroy
[1:32:55] the old man and bring a new creature

[1:33:53] that there's something different here
[1:33:55] than in any other church in the world
[1:33:57] there's something different in those
[1:33:58] people than any other people i've ever

[1:34:03] elect can see and hear

[1:34:22] preeminence in our lives
[1:34:23] and ask that you would mold us into the
[1:34:25] very image of jesus christ
[1:34:27] we're asking in jesus christ's name amen
[1:34:33] friends i just want to remind you of
[1:34:36] what the prophet said when he went down
[1:34:38] to
[1:34:38] chicago to the ministerial association
[1:34:43] in front of 300 ministers
[1:34:45] laid out the word to the scriptures
[1:34:49] he was giving them space to repent
[1:34:53] he had demonstrated time and time again
[1:34:57] the manifestation of god in his life
[1:35:00] he had been thoroughly vindicated before
[1:35:02] their eyes they knew
[1:35:04] that there was something different in
[1:35:06] this man than any other man
[1:35:08] they knew that god was with him they
[1:35:10] knew that there was a power working in
[1:35:11] his life that nobody else had
[1:35:13] they knew it friends there was no
[1:35:14] question in their minds they had seen it
[1:35:16] demonstrated they knew it
[1:35:17] they just disagreed with his doctrine
[1:35:21] here he stands explaining to them
[1:35:25] the word which is the path to the mercy
[1:35:29] seat
[1:35:30] here he is a man anointed by the holy
[1:35:32] ghost with the word
[1:35:34] keeping the way guarding the mercy seat
[1:35:38] and they're given an opportunity to come
[1:35:40] to the mercy seat
[1:35:42] in 70 some say we're going to come down
[1:35:44] and be baptized in jesus christ's name
[1:35:46] and not one of them shows up and in the
[1:35:49] fourth seal he says
[1:35:51] they've been given space to repent and
[1:35:54] he'll kill her children
[1:35:56] with spiritual death see god
[1:36:00] is fair god is just
[1:36:05] god he never brings man to judgment
[1:36:08] without first warning him
[1:36:10] brother random crossed across the globe
[1:36:14] giving a warning of judgment
[1:36:16] demonstrating the life of god
[1:36:18] demonstrating the word sharing the truth
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:23] but friends this day is no different
[1:36:27] god doesn't call me into judgment
[1:36:28] without first giving him warning
[1:36:31] your life has to be a testimony
[1:36:35] of the same thing his life was a
[1:36:37] testimony
[1:36:39] we're coming now we're 52 years after
[1:36:42] the death
[1:36:43] of our prophet 52 years beyond that
[1:36:48] and we're getting ready to step into a
[1:36:50] worldwide tribulation
[1:36:52] but god is just and god is fair
[1:36:56] and i fully expect that this
[1:36:59] bride be put on manifestation and
[1:37:02] vindicated
[1:37:04] in the world given space to repent
[1:37:08] because she's slipping into the worst
[1:37:11] time
[1:37:11] that this world has ever seen the worst
[1:37:15] judgments being poured out upon the
[1:37:16] planet that this world has ever sent
[1:37:18] that
[1:37:18] that has ever been upon the face of the
[1:37:20] planet will be in that tribulation
[1:37:22] period
[1:37:24] but there's a final voice to the final
[1:37:28] age
[1:37:30] and i thoroughly expect god to vindicate
[1:37:33] that voice
[1:37:34] and give a last time of repentance
[1:37:38] before they slip off in the tribulation
[1:37:42] who's willing to surrender your life to
[1:37:45] be part of that
[1:37:47] who's willing to lay down hobbies to be
[1:37:50] part of that not all hobbies are wrong
[1:37:52] but if they get in the way
[1:37:53] lay them down how many is willing to lay
[1:37:57] down their own
[1:37:58] personal likes to be part of that
[1:38:01] your own ideas to be part of that how
[1:38:03] many is willing to take what the prophet
[1:38:04] says
[1:38:05] in the demonstration of his life and
[1:38:07] make it your own
[1:38:08] to be part of that how many is willing
[1:38:11] to sell out their lives
[1:38:13] to keep the way to the tree of life
[1:38:16] oh let's just worship him saints i'm so
[1:38:19] happy to be standing in a group of
[1:38:21] people that i know
[1:38:22] that i know without a doubt have sold
[1:38:25] out their lives
[1:38:26] and will continue to sell out their
[1:38:27] lives and when a greater price is
[1:38:29] required they'll give a greater price
[1:38:31] i'm so glad to be standing in the middle
[1:38:33] of a group of people that have already
[1:38:34] proved it and will prove it again
[1:38:36] and keep proving it so that there's some
[1:38:38] way for the last elect to find their way
[1:38:40] to the mercy seat
[1:38:43] because when the last one comes in we go
[1:38:46] and i want to be part of that you have a
