[0:00] oh if i could just get a hold of that
[0:02] devil if i could just i'd wring his neck
[0:05] i hate statements like that
[0:07] you know i hate him because they're
[0:08] absolutely foolish
[0:12] this creature was full of wisdom the sum
[0:14] of beauty was summed up in him he was so
[0:16] deceptive he could deceive the angels in
[0:18] heaven and you're talking like you could
[0:20] go just take him and ring his neck
[0:23] and even michael when he was disputing
[0:25] with with lucifer over the body over the
[0:27] with the devil over the body of moses he
[0:29] brought not a railing accusation against
[0:31] him but he said the lord deal with thee
[0:34] i think it's foolish and childish to
[0:36] talk like that
[0:39] i think when we talk about
[0:41] you know if i could just punch him in
[0:42] the nose if i could just ring his neck i
[0:44] grew i grew up i grew up in a
[0:47] pentecostal church and we talked about
[0:49] the devil like that all the time
[0:52] while he was deceiving the whole works
[0:57] while they were stuck in
[0:58] denominationalism and trinitarian
[0:59] baptisms and and marriage and re uh
[1:02] divorce and remarriage issues running
[1:04] rampant through the whole church and
[1:05] they were punching the devil and
[1:06] wringing his neck and calling him stupid
[1:13] i say if you want to ring somebody's
[1:15] neck ring your own neck
[1:18] if you want to beat somebody down beat
[1:20] the same one paul was beating because
[1:22] paul was keeping under his body
[1:25] he was bringing it into slavery unless
[1:27] when he preached to others he himself
[1:28] should be a castaway
[1:30] paul was not acting silly and foolish
[1:33] amen brother bam told us that the
[1:35] devil's a worthy adversary because god
[1:37] needed a worthy adversary
[1:41] let's not talk like little kids amen
[1:44] but let's get down to business and say
[1:46] really if i want to defeat the devil
[1:48] i've got to be defeat the devil in me
[1:51] if i'm really going to give him a black
[1:53] eye then i've got to lay this flesh down
[1:55] so the word can move through this flesh
[1:57] that'll give him a black eye if i really
[1:59] want to stomp on him what i got to do is
[2:01] subdue this outer man and bring it in
[2:03] subjection to the word and let the
[2:05] spirit of god flow through me to
[2:06] manifest the word for the hour and then
[2:08] he'll get a black eye then he'll get
[2:10] stomped on the head then he'll be
[2:12] defeated
[2:16] jesus won the victory in gethsemane and
[2:18] that wasn't a jumping up and down and
[2:20] stomping and calling the devil names
[2:24] it was a wrestling with his own will
[2:26] looking to his friends for support
[2:28] asking god again if this could pass by
[2:30] what was he doing he was wrestling it
[2:32] all out and he was overcoming and when
[2:34] he finally subdued his own flesh when he
[2:37] finally subdued his own will he goes
[2:39] back to his friends and said take your
[2:41] rest asleep
[2:42] all is well
[2:43] the son of man has already betrayed into
[2:46] the hands of sinners
[2:48] but it's okay
[2:51] oh if the devil ever got a black eye it
[2:54] was right there
[2:55] if the devil ever got stomped on the
[2:58] head it was right there amen if he ever
[3:00] lost a battle it was right there in
[3:02] gethsemane when jesus christ won back
[3:05] eden
[3:07] and i i'm so tired of hearing rhetoric
[3:10] what we need is a life amen we don't
[3:12] need words and tap rallies in speech
[3:15] what we need is the manifestation of the
[3:16] life of jesus christ one who would only
[3:19] do the father's will we need a people on
[3:21] this earth that will only do the
[3:23] father's will
