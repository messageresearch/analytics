========================================

the Rich Young Ruler who had kept all of The Commandments believed Moses went to synagogue did everything right come to Jesus reverently respectfully kneeling down and calling him good Master when the good Master gave him the answer to his question he didn't want it he wanted his own money he didn't have faith everything that he was portraying wasn't what was really down on the inside he wanted life with no sacrifice he wanted to give up nothing and have everything he wanted the easy way now Jesus comes to zachus zachus does not come to him respectfully zachus does not come and kneel down zakus does not call him good master in the dramatization brother bam said zakus had heard so much about him he was curious but he doubted if he was real and called him an impostor and said he's probably swindling the people why cuz zachus could believe that because that's his own nature he's he's putting his own nature amen onto Jesus and he climbs up in a tree cuz he's not respect for him he's not honoring him he's wanting to hide from him and he's just wanting to peep out and see what's really going on and Jesus comes under his tree and he knows by discernment zakus is up there and he says zachus come down for today I must go abide in your house and and Jesus comes to his house under much criticism because he goes to the house of a sinner but the reality is who was The Sinner who was The Sinner because sin is unbelief it was the rich young man who walked away from Jesus not the is zakus he come reverently he come with all the accolades he come with all all the Commandments have been completed in his life he come ready amen and he he he did not believe zakus came the wrong way as soon as Jesus comes to dinner Z listen Jesus never told zakus what to do or what to say or what did he need for salvation zakus stood up and said Lord I give half of all my goods to the poor how did he know to do that Jesus never required it he never asked him to amen Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler if you do this you will get this Jesus never said that to zakus he never promised zakus anything this came out of the faith that was inside zakus he stood up he caught the revelation and he realized amen half of everything I got I give to the poor if I've stole anything from anybody I'll restore fourfold and you might say well you know the request of the Rich Young Ruler was give everything if he gave everything he wouldn't have anything to restore what he stole after he gives half to the poor and he pays back four times everything he's taken he may not have been left with a nickel to his name friends yeah how did he stand up and do what the rich younger miss doing and the rich Young Ruler heard the sermons heard the testimonies supposedly live the life but who had the life zakus because faith has an effect when he come in contact with Jesus Christ and recognize who this was it had an effect on him and that effect came into a manifestation
