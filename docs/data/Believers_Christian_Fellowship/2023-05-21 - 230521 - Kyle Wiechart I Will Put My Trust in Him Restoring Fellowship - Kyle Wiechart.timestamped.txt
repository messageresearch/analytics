[13:39] again for this great opportunity that
[13:41] thou has given us Lord Lord in a day and
[13:43] age where people are so entertained Lord
[13:46] with things of this world and the cares
[13:48] of this life running to and fro Lord
[13:50] some trying to satisfy a thirst in their
[13:53] heart with entertainments with money
[13:55] with business Lord how many won't even
[13:58] honor you this day of the resurrection
[14:00] and go to church the Lord by your grace
[14:02] you've assembled us today Lord we
[14:05] believe it was for a purpose and Lord we
[14:07] just asked Lord that you would bless our
[14:09] time
[14:10] pray Lord that you would take my lips
[14:12] and you pushed me out of the way Lord
[14:14] and say those things that are needful
[14:16] Lord to help your people Lord I am
[14:18] insufficient I am unable but Lord you
[14:22] are more than able to do things that we
[14:24] have no idea what we could possibly do
[14:27] when we just yield ourselves to thee so
[14:30] father God speak through my lips and
[14:32] hear through the ears that are before me
[14:34] Father we love you we commit this time
[14:36] into your hands in Jesus name amen
[14:40] amen I'll let you have your seats for
[14:41] just a moment
[14:44] well it's good to be with you again I
[14:48] always would rather be sitting in the
[14:49] chair by my wife but it followeth my lot
[14:52] to be here then knowing brother Isaiah
[14:54] was here and I was like well I'd really
[14:56] rather be sitting in my chair today such
[14:59] a song brother I inspiring song So
[15:02] enjoyed the service Wednesday night how
[15:04] many enjoyed the service I was really
[15:06] blessed by the service and
[15:10] that was the first time I got the
[15:12] opportunity to hear our brother Isaiah
[15:14] and I was truly blessed I really really
[15:17] enjoyed it and I was so encouraged uh
[15:21] you all know what happened with me a
[15:22] couple years ago when I mowed the yard
[15:25] and I hit a bunch of stones and it threw
[15:27] it on my Jeep and threw a stone at the
[15:28] neighbor and the neighbor started
[15:29] cussing me out and I got a little bit
[15:31] angry and then to hear Brother Isaiah
[15:34] Brooks kind of had a little similar
[15:36] situation and it made me feel a little
[15:38] better that we're all growing we're all
[15:41] maturing in the grace and knowledge of
[15:43] God and it's certainly not him that
[15:45] willeth nor him that runeth it's God
[15:48] that showed us Grace and it's his grace
[15:50] that keeps us it's his grace that holds
[15:52] us it's his grace that gives us just
[15:54] enough Faith to take the next step right
[15:56] before us bringing us back into his
[15:58] presence with fellowship with him so I
[16:01] sure enjoyed it brother Isaiah wanted to
[16:03] obviously let you know brother Chad
[16:05] better Ben told us he's down in Junction
[16:07] City Ministry into the group down there
[16:09] and the family is there with him so you
[16:11] all be praying for him
[16:13] just a lovely group I was there last
[16:15] month and boy they're fun to minister to
[16:17] very open very hungry and just a real
[16:19] honor
[16:21] um as you all know oh I have the I think
[16:23] I have it right brother Franco there was
[16:25] some pictures
[16:27] um there was a baptism on Thursday me
[16:28] and brother Wesley were invited
[16:31] um last month when I was down in
[16:32] Junction City a young man from Holmes
[16:35] County had come down he said the Lord
[16:37] told him to come down to the meeting and
[16:39] when he was there he uh we we spoke on
[16:42] walking in the light and he had a desire
[16:45] to be baptized he called me and he said
[16:47] brother I went to my pastor I asked him
[16:49] to re-baptize me in the name of the Lord
[16:51] he said I'll be praying about it he came
[16:53] to him a couple days later and said I
[16:55] don't feel comfortable in doing that and
[16:57] so he called me and said brother will
[16:58] you baptize me I said it'd be an honor
[17:00] brother and so I had a couple pictures
[17:01] from that we drove over on Thursday to
[17:04] Danville
[17:05] and uh just probably the most beautiful
[17:08] setting for a baptism I've ever been a
[17:10] part of
[17:11] um me and brother Ron were baptizing in
[17:13] Pakistan in a drainage ditch this was a
[17:16] little bit of an upgrade from that just
[17:19] slightly so I was really like wow this
[17:21] is nice we should do them all like this
[17:22] and just a beautiful Bridge there that
[17:25] they found that was a deep enough for a
[17:28] baptism and about 35 people showed up
[17:31] almost the entire group from Junction
[17:34] City showed up
[17:36] and a couple unique things about it was
[17:39] you see this couple right there before
[17:40] you that's an Amish couple and uh they
[17:44] had just so happened the the lady there
[17:46] said hey we should go for a bike ride
[17:47] today and told her husband and so they
[17:49] went for a bike ride and she said well
[17:51] let's go to that bridge of Dreams we'll
[17:53] go ride our bikes up there so they're
[17:55] riding their bikes and wouldn't you know
[17:57] they know Jesse Jesse's the one we
[18:00] baptized they did not know anybody else
[18:02] there but they knew Jesse Jesse lives an
[18:05] hour away but they knew Jesse now I
[18:07] don't even know the full connection but
[18:08] they saw him like Jesse what are you
[18:10] doing here he said I'm getting baptized
[18:12] in the name Lord Jesus Christ I'm like
[18:14] whoa we're gonna stay and so they stayed
[18:18] and I um
[18:21] I uh thought I would just share a couple
[18:23] scriptures on baptism and I end up
[18:24] preaching for like 35 minutes
[18:27] um and I it was such a unique it was
[18:29] just like a poll I didn't even like
[18:30] hardly get to say hi I'm Kyle I just
[18:32] they're standing there we all gathered
[18:34] in the shade and I just kept I just went
[18:36] I just went I don't know what else to
[18:38] tell you I just went and uh they stood
[18:41] there locked for 35 minutes that Amish
[18:43] couple and um there was another man
[18:46] there I won't Point him out but there's
[18:49] another man there who came he's the
[18:51] father of one that was baptized a couple
[18:54] months ago part of that Junction City
[18:56] group he's still in the Amish and he
[18:57] came and then after the baptism and
[19:00] after hearing the things he said well
[19:01] looks like I'll be getting re-baptized
[19:03] soon and this son told him he says that
[19:06] means this is a big deal for him he's
[19:08] kind of an elder in the Amish church
[19:10] that he's a part of this is uh pretty
[19:12] much a clear rejection that he's
[19:14] approaching but he's convinced and uh
[19:18] and even that Amish couple they went
[19:19] away and they they said you know what
[19:21] our daughter called us this morning and
[19:23] said you know what something really good
[19:25] is going to happen and they're like now
[19:26] we see what this was this was that
[19:28] really good thing that was supposed to
[19:30] happen they shook my hand thanked me and
[19:32] just was really happy to be there so I
[19:35] don't exactly know what all is going on
[19:37] but something's happening something is
[19:39] clearly happening over there and I'm
[19:41] just so happy to see it to see those
[19:44] those you know their eyes light up when
[19:46] they hear the word it's just like it's
[19:48] so freeing to him you know the truth
[19:50] shall set you free and to see they just
[19:53] light up and they're so hungry and
[19:55] they're so open like I pull no punches
[19:57] I'm saying things as hard as I know how
[19:59] to say them and they're like liking it
[20:00] I'm like wow this is great this is
[20:03] refreshing and um so God's doing
[20:06] something and we're all he'll take it I
[20:08] don't know but this I know God usually
[20:11] gives just enough light to see if you'll
[20:12] take that next step and thus far I
[20:15] believe now 25 people 26 people have
[20:17] taken that step and we're trusting God
[20:19] to give a little bit lower light and to
[20:21] continue to walk in those next steps and
[20:23] so because we find that's the nature of
[20:25] God and that's what God's doing with all
[20:27] of his children he's just putting forth
[20:29] just enough light before you to see if
[20:31] you'll walk in that light with him and
[20:33] so it was just a real honor to be there
[20:36] and then here is our the brother Jesse
[20:39] and just a sweet man I just the first
[20:41] time I talked to him he came to that
[20:43] baptism of the 17 in Junction City it's
[20:45] the first time I met him he sat beside
[20:47] me by the campfire and we just started
[20:49] talking and uh he came out of the Amish
[20:52] uh came out of from what I gather a
[20:54] pretty bad situation at home and he said
[20:57] to think just a year ago I was addicted
[20:59] to drugs and now here I am set free from
[21:01] those things and know the love of God
[21:03] and I'm walking with God it's just a
[21:05] real humble sweet sincerity that just
[21:08] really was awesome it was so good to see
[21:11] and he just after the baptism he just
[21:13] asked everybody will you be he said will
[21:15] you pray for me so I can show the love
[21:17] of God to my parents
[21:20] I said well we'll be praying for you we
[21:22] believe that that's a sincere hearts
[21:24] desire and God's going to bless him in
[21:26] in doing that so he wants to show love
[21:29] to his parents so you peering for him
[21:32] be praying for him
[21:34] and so that was awesome and uh then I
[21:38] just wanted to let you know brother Chad
[21:39] had mentioned a little bible study so on
[21:40] Friday night we had a Bible study and I
[21:43] wanted to share just a reason why that
[21:45] bible study
[21:47] um a few months back about six months
[21:49] ago I was cleaning out my office which I
[21:51] tried to do every five to seven years
[21:52] it's kind of my pattern
[21:56] and when I was cleaning out my office
[21:57] like six months ago my wife's a better
[22:00] cleaner than me and I know she loves to
[22:01] do it otherwise you know just kidding
[22:04] um I came across this paper
[22:07] and this paper I hadn't seen this for 10
[22:10] years or eight years or something and
[22:12] this paper inspired me and about 10
[22:15] years ago a lot of the men here had a
[22:18] men's meeting we were over in poke again
[22:20] and the former Pastor asked all the men
[22:23] a question he said what something like
[22:25] this he said what did this message
[22:27] reveal to you about Christ
[22:30] and I said well that's easy I grabbed my
[22:33] pen and I started writing and I filled
[22:35] out the front and the back
[22:37] and when I began to look at it I
[22:39] realized I did not know who he was I had
[22:42] heard about God but it was too far away
[22:45] from me and I began to realize this
[22:47] message meeting personal it made me
[22:50] understand the character I said it's
[22:51] like it was all foggy it was all blurry
[22:53] and now I can see the detail of his
[22:55] character and of his nature and what he
[22:57] likes and what he doesn't like it's like
[22:59] I've now personally come in contact with
[23:01] the person of the word that I heard
[23:03] about it's like that scripture I have
[23:05] heard but now I see
[23:07] and I began to look at those and I began
[23:08] to realize how much of this has meant so
[23:10] much to me and I had wrote down the holy
[23:13] spirit's very timid he can only lead a
[23:15] lamb-like nature I understand correct
[23:17] baptism I understand the anointed ones
[23:19] at the uh at the end time I can now see
[23:22] the wise and foolish version the foolish
[23:24] version not damn but let's go through
[23:25] tribulation I realized in predestination
[23:27] I wasn't looking for God he came looking
[23:29] for me and I filled this out and every
[23:31] one of these was like a stepping stone
[23:33] for me
[23:34] that brought me into his presence so
[23:36] when I was looking at that six months
[23:37] ago something struck me about it and
[23:40] then I a couple months later was reading
[23:42] in Hebrews and in Hebrews 5 it says you
[23:45] know he's talking about Melchizedek and
[23:46] when he's talking about Melchizedek he
[23:48] said oh I have a lot of things I'd like
[23:49] to tell you and he says but this strong
[23:51] meat and you can't handle it
[23:53] and he says when you ought to be
[23:55] teachers you have need for somebody to
[23:58] teach you the first principles
[24:00] and when I read that I thought first
[24:02] principles so in order for me to step in
[24:05] and see the complete mystery of God I
[24:07] got to make sure I have a good grasp of
[24:09] these first principles then he drops
[24:11] down and he says you know let us move on
[24:13] to Perfection not laying again the
[24:14] foundation of what of repentance unto
[24:17] dead works and a faith in God and of
[24:19] baptism and of laying on of hands and
[24:21] all of these things he said but thus we
[24:24] will do
[24:25] and when it struck me and I thought oh
[24:27] now the burden's there and it's not
[24:29] going away I feel to do this so I talked
[24:32] to brother Chad and I said Hey Brother
[24:34] um if it's all right I like to start
[24:36] doing a Bible study especially for the
[24:38] young people but anybody that's babes or
[24:41] anybody that would like to pull up some
[24:43] of these stepping stones and look at
[24:44] them together and uh and maybe it'll
[24:47] help our faith and then I want to be
[24:49] found faithful I always want to be bound
[24:51] faithful to do my part first to my
[24:54] family and then to the youth you know
[24:55] it's a tremendous honor that you parents
[24:57] get get to allow me to minister to your
[25:00] youth I appreciate the confidence and I
[25:02] feel a responsibility
[25:04] to do my best
[25:05] so
[25:07] that's the burden and if anybody wants
[25:09] to come if you're a new believer or
[25:11] you'd like to look at some of those
[25:12] stones you're more than welcome to come
[25:14] we'll be having those Bible studies the
[25:16] first and third Friday night and we took
[25:19] that first one uh not
[25:22] repentance of dead works and having
[25:24] faith to God realizing this has nothing
[25:26] to do with your Merit you didn't Merit a
[25:28] thing this this is God's grace Abraham
[25:30] didn't do anything God came to Abraham
[25:32] and it was his Covenant that God made
[25:34] with Abraham not that Abraham could keep
[25:37] that Covenant but God would keep that
[25:38] Covenant unconditionally we find we are
[25:40] of the same offspring of Abraham
[25:44] and we're going to go on into water
[25:45] baptism I want to go into mystery
[25:47] Babylon mother harlots the Seal of God
[25:50] the mark of the beast some of those
[25:51] foundational truths that we know I
[25:54] understand we know it but some of us may
[25:56] need to look at it a little bit more
[25:57] clearly and just realize they're just
[25:59] stepping stones into his presence and so
[26:02] you're more than welcome to come if you
[26:03] should like to do so so now you
[26:06] understand why
[26:08] all right
[26:09] I got all the announcements that I can
[26:11] think of off my mind
[26:13] yep why don't you stand with me
[26:15] I'd like to sing a song while we kind of
[26:18] change the order here for a moment
[26:21] the song struck my heart this morning

[30:16] [Music]
[30:20] amen
[30:22] if you will turn in your Bibles to
[30:24] Jeremiah chapter 8
[30:29] . thank you musicians appreciate it
[30:39] how many's faith is looking to him
[30:44] that's where I'm resting in
[30:47] my faith is resting in his infallible
[30:49] word
[30:51] my faith is not resting in my human
[30:53] intellects or my human abilities
[30:55] anybody that walks with the Lord long
[30:57] enough you become to be getting less
[30:59] confident in yourself more confident
[31:02] that God will never fail God keeps his
[31:05] word God will perform his word this is
[31:08] his victory not mine
[31:11] and I was
[31:13] preparing yesterday and just not just
[31:17] alone and just kept wandering and
[31:19] walking and praying and meditating and
[31:22] walking and praying and meditating and
[31:24] hit nothing for hours and hours and
[31:26] hours
[31:27] and then around 7 30 8 o'clock at night
[31:29] I read a scripture
[31:32] as soon as I read the stricture it lit
[31:34] up for me and I went for a walk and
[31:36] started crying and began to think some
[31:38] things through it and that's what we're
[31:41] going to go into I believe in
[31:43] I believe Paul was unorganized but
[31:46] spirit-led I believe that the Holy Ghost
[31:48] takes us in our his hands and he he just
[31:51] guides our footsteps one foot at one
[31:53] step at a time and I'm just trusting I'm
[31:55] walking out here by faith he's gonna
[31:57] light one thing up for me I'll take a
[31:59] step in that he'll light another thing
[32:00] up for me I'll take a step in that
[32:02] because I still want him to be my guide
[32:04] I can't guide myself you can't guide
[32:07] yourself I need a guide I need somebody
[32:09] that I can have faith and confidence in
[32:11] that I take his hand and he leads me
[32:13] through each and every day all the way
[32:15] into his presence and so I want to take
[32:18] a look at these scriptures and I'm truly
[32:19] trusting him and you'll be praying you
[32:22] be pulling you look to God I'm just a
[32:24] man I'm insufficient in every way
[32:26] possible there's only a couple things
[32:27] I'm good at and that's really failing
[32:29] I'm really good at failing God can never
[32:32] fail I can fail are you good at
[32:34] something failing that's what you're
[32:36] good at that's what we are good at as
[32:37] human beings we're good at messing
[32:39] things up I'm so glad that he cannot
[32:42] fail and his word can't he cannot lie
[32:46] that word will never fail it will never
[32:48] the whole world will pass away but that
[32:50] word will never pass away and if I can
[32:53] just place my faith and if I have faith
[32:55] in God that came from God that was a
[32:57] free gift of God if I can just rest
[32:59] right there on his word and wait for for
[33:01] him he'll perform every promise that he
[33:04] promised he would make
[33:06] and so I'd like you to look here in
[33:08] Jeremiah chapter 8 verse 19.
[33:12] Jeremiah chapter 8 verse 19.
[33:18] it begins like this
[33:21] behold the voice of the Cry of the
[33:23] daughter of my people because of them
[33:27] that dwell in a far country
[33:29] is not the Lord in Zion
[33:32] question mark
[33:34] is not her King in her
[33:37] why have they provoked me to anger with
[33:41] their graven images and with strange
[33:45] vanities
[33:46] the Harvest is past the summer is ended
[33:49] and we are not saved for the hurt of the
[33:53] daughter of my people am I hurt
[33:56] I am black and astonishment hath taken
[34:00] Hold On Me is there no bomb in Gilead is
[34:05] there no physician there why then is not
[34:08] the health of the of the daughter of my
[34:12] people recovered
[34:15] we also turn to Hebrews chapters 2
[34:19] verse 8.
[34:31] Hebrews chapters 2 verse 8.
[34:36] the word of God reads thou Hast put all
[34:39] things in subjection under his feet
[34:44] for in that he put all in subjection
[34:47] under him he left nothing that is not
[34:50] put under him but now we see not yet all
[34:55] things under him but we see Jesus who
[35:00] was made a little lower than the angels
[35:02] for the suffering of death crowned with
[35:04] Glory and Honor that he by the grace of
[35:07] God should taste death for every man for
[35:10] it becometh him for whom are all things
[35:12] and by whom are all things and bringing
[35:16] many sons unto glory to make the captain
[35:19] of their salvation perfect through
[35:21] sufferings for both he that sanctifieth
[35:25] and they whom are Sanctified are all of
[35:30] one for which cause he is not ashamed to
[35:33] call them Brethren saying I will declare
[35:37] thy name unto my brethren and in the
[35:41] midst of the church will I sing praise
[35:43] unto thee e and again I will put my
[35:49] trust in him and again behold I and the
[35:53] children which God hath given me
[35:56] it's powerheads Heavenly Father once
[35:58] more we come before you Lord take the
[36:01] word speak to our hearts
[36:03] Lord you be the Divine interpreter and
[36:05] Lord brood amongst your people we pray
[36:07] in Jesus name amen
[36:09] it may be seated
[36:14] for a title I'm drawing from that last
[36:16] portion of scripture it says I will put
[36:19] my trust in him
[36:22] anti is a subtitle which I'm not good at
[36:25] subtitles but I I like them I like to at
[36:27] least say I have a subtitle
[36:30] restoring Fellowship
[36:33] and as I was walking there yesterday and
[36:36] I was walked outside and I began to
[36:38] meditate on that scripture of I will put
[36:40] my trust in him my daughter came up to
[36:43] me and she gave me a hug said I love you
[36:45] walked away
[36:47] then about an hour later I'm inside
[36:48] still sitting there meditating my wife
[36:50] came up kissed me on the back head
[36:52] walked away and as a father and as a
[36:55] husband again I think my I sure love
[36:56] them they're thinking of me here I am I
[36:59] don't know what I'm going to preach
[37:00] tomorrow I don't have a clue where this
[37:01] is going I'm not good at this I
[37:03] shouldn't even be doing this brother
[37:04] Isaiah's here he should do this there's
[37:06] others here far more with ability and
[37:09] confidence and experience they should do
[37:11] this and uh but as I'm sitting there I'm
[37:13] realizing just how much I love the
[37:15] fellowship of my family boy it means so
[37:18] much to you when someone just comes up
[37:19] puts their arms around and say I love
[37:21] you I'm praying for you Daddy man that
[37:24] meant a lot to me and then instantly I
[37:26] began to think about God and began to
[37:29] think about what happened back there in
[37:30] the garden you know this whole thing he
[37:33] God loves Fellowship God wants
[37:35] Fellowship God just doesn't want to be
[37:38] known God wants Fellowship he wants you
[37:41] to come into His presence he wants to
[37:42] walk with you he wants to be known he
[37:45] and you can't walk with him unless you
[37:46] know him and how can you know him except
[37:48] he expresses himself and he takes you
[37:50] through circumstances and situations and
[37:53] problems and darkness he wants to
[37:55] express these attributes he'll allow you
[37:57] to get sick just so he can express that
[37:59] he's the Healer he'll allows you to go
[38:01] into darkness just to bring forth the
[38:02] light of Deliverance in your life he has
[38:05] all these attributes because he's a
[38:06] father he's a savior he's a Healer he's
[38:08] a guide he's all of these things he's
[38:11] everything and everything is put under
[38:13] his feet and I'm not looking to me I'm
[38:16] looking to him because he's everything
[38:17] and as I began to sit there I began to
[38:20] think oh what did God feel that day when
[38:23] man rejected his leadership when man
[38:25] grieved him when man stepped away from
[38:28] the protection and the covering of the
[38:30] veil of the word of God and by a lust
[38:32] Veil who lusted for knowledge lusted for
[38:35] things that God didn't share with him
[38:36] and it brought them out from behind the
[38:39] veil of God's word and he separated
[38:41] Fellowship Ma you can imagine what God
[38:45] felt in that hour my how it grieved him
[38:48] how it broke his heart the highlight of
[38:50] his day was coming down in the cool of
[38:52] the evenings no doubt seeing hey
[38:54] children did you enjoy your day how did
[38:56] I saw I saw you guys are over by the
[38:58] lake and I saw you over there with Leo
[39:00] the Lion did you have a great day oh
[39:02] Father we had just a wonderful day and
[39:04] you know every father that comes home
[39:06] you like to hear how you kids did that
[39:07] day every every husband wants to hear
[39:10] how'd your wife do that day you want to
[39:12] sit there you want to hear if they had a
[39:13] good day and you like to hear you're
[39:15] like Eliana she's so expression my
[39:17] little six-year-old she's so expression
[39:18] she can make
[39:20] a boring story exciting you know it's
[39:22] just the reality they can just they just
[39:24] light up with certain things and it's
[39:25] such a highlight for a father and a
[39:27] mother to hear their children to have a
[39:30] good day oh I had such a wonderful time
[39:31] with their friends for doing this or
[39:33] doing that it's a it's a highlight it's
[39:35] a highlight in my evening to come home
[39:37] to have dinner with the family and hear
[39:39] how everybody's doing how'd you do and
[39:41] how'd the wife doing and all those
[39:43] things it's my highlight I love that
[39:45] fellowship with my family and in fact I
[39:47] love you all but I'd rather spend time
[39:49] with my wife and daughters more than all
[39:51] of you now I'm just being honest you
[39:53] would say the same thing if you were
[39:55] here we love each other but there's just
[39:57] something about that closeness you have
[39:59] with a husband and a wife and your
[40:01] children you love them you love being
[40:03] with them and you begin to think about
[40:05] God wanting that Fellowship having that
[40:08] fellowship and then it's broken
[40:10] like
[40:12] a husband that comes home and he sees
[40:14] his wife's despondent we've all been
[40:15] there we see our wives she's quiet she's
[40:18] distance and it just eats you up like
[40:20] what's wrong what what happened did I do
[40:22] something what you can't rest am I the
[40:24] only one I'm a little bit weird about
[40:26] that you know I see my daughter she's
[40:28] kind of down a little bit I was like Hey
[40:30] the world stops what's going on I want
[40:31] to know what's happened I want to know
[40:33] what what what what happened someone
[40:34] hurt you someone say something did you
[40:36] do something what happened you know it's
[40:38] in me as a father to want to understand
[40:40] and I want my family happy
[40:43] I want my children happy I want my wife
[40:45] happy I want to see Smiles I don't want
[40:47] to see frowns you know and it's just in
[40:49] me to go about to do whatever I can do
[40:51] to put a smile back on their face it's
[40:54] just something in us it's something in a
[40:56] father something in a mother it's
[40:58] something in us that's doing that and I
[41:01] began to think oh my goodness what did
[41:03] he feel that hour what did he feel how
[41:06] did he feel
[41:07] oh man
[41:09] but he wasn't going to let it stay
[41:11] separated God rich in Mercy went to
[41:15] action to restore Fellowship that's what
[41:19] this entire mystery plan of God is it's
[41:21] restoring Fellowship that's what God
[41:25] wanted in the beginning that's his
[41:27] heart's desire not just to know about
[41:30] God but to know God I know him in the
[41:33] power of his resurrection we his
[41:35] benefactors partakers of his divine
[41:38] nature and that's when I had that little
[41:40] piece of paper I started looking at all
[41:41] these truths all of these truths were
[41:43] bringing into view the nature and the
[41:45] character of the person Jesus Christ and
[41:48] when I began to understand him again to
[41:49] understand why he said this why he said
[41:52] that why he did this why he did that you
[41:55] look at the tender hand of Jehovah
[41:56] without the revelation of this message
[41:58] and how he dealt with Israel through the
[42:00] Old Testament you would stand back and
[42:02] say what kind of God is this I'm a
[42:04] little bit scared I'm a little bit
[42:05] nervous but under the revelation of the
[42:07] mystery of the message and this hour it
[42:09] brought into view the tender hand of
[42:11] Jehovah God loves his children so much
[42:14] he'll spank you so hard sometimes
[42:16] because he loves you he wants fellowship
[42:19] with you he's going to restore
[42:21] fellowship at all costs
[42:23] that's God's purpose that's God's desire
[42:26] Fellowship not that we should just all
[42:29] gather as a group of people and come to
[42:30] a church and agree with a certain set of
[42:32] doctrines or certain set of truths no
[42:35] this is the fellowship of his attributes
[42:37] connecting again with the divine nature
[42:40] of God that's his heart's desire I'm a
[42:43] partaker of the divine nature of God
[42:46] that's what I'm Desiring that's what he
[42:49] desired to restore Fellowship
[42:52] and you cannot have Fellowship unless
[42:53] you understand one another you know a
[42:55] husband has to understand a wife a wife
[42:57] has to understand a husband in order for
[42:59] there to be Fellowship a brother has to
[43:01] understand the brother another you know
[43:02] for Fellowship there's got to be
[43:04] understanding for Fellowship
[43:07] so this whole thing was to bring about
[43:09] Fellowship restored attributes of God
[43:12] bringing them back into fellowship and I
[43:14] found it interesting when brother
[43:16] branham's first recorded sermon it is
[43:18] Faith is the substance
[43:21] the last recorded message of brother
[43:23] Branham is communion in communion he
[43:26] says I realize I'm not the son of
[43:29] Charles and Ella Branham I am a Son of
[43:32] God and he goes on to say and in the
[43:34] presence of God he said like a little
[43:36] Eagle I've been called up higher now in
[43:38] the presence of God now you understand
[43:40] what this is all about now do you see
[43:42] the pyramid we're climbing everyone
[43:44] God's all had us on a journey to bring
[43:47] us back into Fellowship again restoring
[43:49] that which was lost in the Garden of
[43:51] Eden now he's restoring that Fellowship
[43:54] in the devil's Eden Satan's Eden God's
[43:57] restoring his attributes again oh my
[44:00] goodness this is awesome to me this goes
[44:03] beyond just trying to mentally
[44:04] intellectually try to put something
[44:06] together I see the purpose of God God's
[44:08] doing all of these things to restore me
[44:11] back into my position with God that I
[44:13] had with him before the foundation of
[44:15] the earth redeeming those attributes for
[44:18] Fellowship
[44:19] Hebrews 11 5 says by faith Enoch was
[44:23] translated that he should not see death
[44:25] in that he was not found because God
[44:28] translated him and before his
[44:30] translation he had this testimony he
[44:33] that he pleased God but without faith
[44:36] without faith
[44:39] it's impossible to please him
[44:41] for he that cometh the God must believe
[44:43] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[44:45] them who diligently seek him so the
[44:48] entire first step of this walk or this
[44:50] journey back to fellowship begins with
[44:52] what everyone faith
[44:54] Faith virtue knowledge temperance
[44:58] patience brotherly kindness in the
[45:00] Capstone of divine love but it's all
[45:02] settling on this first set of
[45:04] foundational truths and that is faith
[45:06] Faith did it salvation is a free gift of
[45:09] God everyone
[45:10] you didn't do anything to earn it not of
[45:13] Works lest any man shall boast none of
[45:15] us can boast in our Salvation none of us
[45:17] can say I earned it I married it I'm
[45:20] doing a pretty good job nope remember
[45:21] you're good at one thing failing we're
[45:24] all good at making mistakes we're all
[45:25] good at messing up the plan of or
[45:27] messing up what God would intend for our
[45:30] lives but oh God rich in mercy God rich
[45:33] and mercy came our way redeemed that
[45:35] attribute out of mud and muck and
[45:37] restores the fellowship let you learn
[45:40] some things sometimes let you go into
[45:41] some Dark Places just to show you I'm
[45:44] still there I never leave you I'll never
[45:47] forsake you I'll be with you even in you
[45:49] to the end of the world what a precious
[45:51] promise we have you believe that you
[45:53] actually believe that God promised and
[45:56] said I'll never leave you I'll never
[45:58] forsake you I'll always be with you you
[46:01] know what my faith says amen my faith
[46:04] says amen I didn't Merit that I don't
[46:06] deserve that I should have grieved him
[46:08] away and he should have left me and
[46:09] found somebody else way better than me a
[46:12] long time ago everyone but it's election
[46:14] God's election God foreordained me to
[46:18] stand in this hour God foreordained me
[46:20] to come across this message God
[46:22] forordained that that light would strike
[46:24] your life God foreordained the situation
[46:26] God even foreign major problems
[46:29] sometimes just as the vehicle to bring
[46:31] you and Usher you into the very Presence
[46:33] of Jehovah God you look at Jonah my what
[46:37] a bad situation Joan is in backslidden
[46:40] running from God from the carnal mind it
[46:43] looks like it we all know brother Benham
[46:44] said no I was prophets of God can't
[46:46] backside but he was certainly doing his
[46:48] best to get away from what God had
[46:50] purposed him to do so none of us are in
[46:52] this bad of a state brother Benham said
[46:54] he says I look this way whale's belly I
[46:55] look this way whale's belly I'm all tied
[46:57] up in seaweed I'm laying in vomit but
[47:00] what did Jonah do
[47:02] he remembered Solomon prayed a prayer
[47:04] and when Solomon prayed a prayer he said
[47:07] if any of your children be in trouble
[47:08] let them look this way and God would
[47:11] deliver them Jonah in the belly of a
[47:13] whale covered in vomit remembers the
[47:16] promise of God and he went to delivering
[47:19] so then what happened the very vehicle
[47:21] that looked like his destruction was the
[47:24] very vehicle God uses to deliver him to
[47:26] fulfill his purpose so many times we get
[47:29] so upset why this situation why this
[47:31] problem why am I in this don't you
[47:34] realize this could be the very vehicle
[47:36] that God is using to test your faith to
[47:38] turn you back to the promise of God and
[47:40] God will take that vehicle to Usher you
[47:42] right back into fellowship with him I
[47:45] believe that
[47:46] I'm going to be real honest I absolutely
[47:49] believe these things with all my heart
[47:51] my carnal mind doesn't understand it but
[47:53] something down inside of me says that's
[47:55] nothing but the truth God's word can't
[47:57] fail I will fail God can't and I'm
[48:01] resting in that my faith is resting in
[48:04] that my salvation is resting that he did
[48:07] this work me being a part of that elect
[48:09] bride of Jesus Christ I realized I
[48:12] didn't Merit you can't Merit it you
[48:14] ain't figuring your way into this gun
[48:16] guys this is a sovereign Act of God
[48:19] God's Victory not my victory his victory
[48:23] and he is bringing me into his presence
[48:26] I'm not figuring this out I'm not trying
[48:28] to say okay if I make that one and I
[48:30] figured this one and then I do this and
[48:31] then I do that forget about it I have no
[48:34] confidence in myself I have Supreme
[48:36] confidence that this is all God's plan
[48:38] all things were created by Him and for
[48:41] him he said he would have a bride of
[48:43] who's choosing his choosing oh my I'm so

[48:55] be prideful in the goodness and the
[48:57] mercy and the grace of God came your way
[48:59] elected you you saw something why did
[49:02] you see something why do you believe it
[49:05] like why millions and billions of people
[49:08] that are way smarter than you know way
[49:10] more scriptures than you have rejected
[49:12] these things
[49:13] so it's not based upon intellect
[49:15] he says to Peter who do you say that I
[49:17] am he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[49:20] of the Living God oh blessed art thou
[49:22] Simon barjona Flesh and Blood never
[49:24] revealed this to you but my Father which
[49:25] is in heaven revealed this to you he
[49:28] reveals himself to you you don't figure
[49:30] him out he Reveals His word to you and
[49:33] you by faith if you have faith can say
[49:35] amen that's nothing but the truth and
[49:37] your agreeance and just having faith in
[49:39] God will produce the promise that God
[49:41] has made to you you just believe it you
[49:44] may look at yourself and say I'm not
[49:46] worthy of this
[49:47] correct you've done a proper analysis
[49:50] you are a miserable failure you have
[49:53] done nothing good but God rich in Mercy
[49:57] in order to restore Fellowship play
[49:59] something inside of you that at the
[50:01] right time will say I will put my trust
[50:04] in him
[50:06] not him that willeth nor him that runeth
[50:08] I put my trust in him
[50:11] and you rest the sum of the Christian
[50:13] life is what rest just rest little bride
[50:17] just rest he's going to perform his will
[50:19] just rest just believe don't doubt don't
[50:22] get discouraged just rest it's so
[50:25] important Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the
[50:30] same yesterday today and forever what he
[50:34] was yesterday he still is today what he
[50:38] is today he will forever be I'm resting
[50:42] in that I'm resting he's never failed
[50:45] I'm resting that never one has one of
[50:48] his promises and one of his words ever
[50:50] failed I'm resting in the fact that he
[50:52] that makes the promise keeps the promise
[50:54] I'm resting in the fact that he started
[50:56] this work in me he'll finish this work
[50:58] in me I'm trusting that he's the author
[51:01] and the finisher of this faith
[51:04] I can't oh foolish Galatians what hath
[51:07] Bewitched you you came out by the
[51:08] hearing of the word of what faith
[51:10] you came out by faith what does hinder
[51:13] you to make you think you can add one
[51:15] inch of your stature by doing or keeping
[51:18] a certain law or doing this or doing
[51:20] that you know what I'm here to do I'm
[51:21] here to restore your faith back in the
[51:23] promises of God this is God's doing not
[51:25] yours everyone I want you to have such
[51:28] enough confidence and faith and saying
[51:30] what is this inside of me that says Amen
[51:32] to the word of God though I can't
[51:34] mechanically put it all together I'm
[51:36] saying amen little sister had he right
[51:38] I'm sure she couldn't mechanically say
[51:40] that happened because of this and that
[51:42] happened because of this no she heard
[51:44] the word and said that ain't nothing but
[51:46] the truth everyone
[51:48] I can't mechanically put all the piece
[51:50] of this together but I know God's
[51:51] restoring fellowship with me and all
[51:53] along the way by God's grace and his
[51:54] Sovereign Grace to me I'm saying that
[51:56] ain't nothing but the truth brother that
[51:58] ain't nothing but the truth sister that
[52:00] is nothing but God's Vindicated word
[52:02] bringing it to pass in my life that's
[52:03] him that's not me that's him not me even
[52:06] looking at Holmes County not even
[52:07] understanding what's going on here we're
[52:09] not trying to do anything it's just like
[52:10] something keeps happening we just keep
[52:12] getting pulled over there and things
[52:14] start happening we're not trying to do
[52:15] anything God rich and mercy is doing
[52:18] something God's doing something you may
[52:20] not even understand why you make the
[52:21] decision to make why do they take this
[52:23] job why did I move here why did this
[52:25] happen God rich and mercy knows exactly
[52:27] what he's doing he's intending to bring
[52:30] you back into Fellowship just don't get
[52:32] discouraged if all you ever see is
[52:33] whale's belly around you
[52:36] just look to the promise look up your
[52:39] redemption's here
[52:41] boy who would have thought you think
[52:42] Jonah was thinking my Redemption
[52:44] it's a whale's belly
[52:46] vomit seaweed wrapped around mine and my
[52:48] this is my Deliverance this is going to
[52:50] take me to the promise so I can fulfill
[52:52] my purpose that God has brought me to
[52:53] this earth
[52:56] how many of us have been that situation
[52:57] we start to question God
[53:00] we start to say Lord surely this is not
[53:02] working
[53:05] hey that
[53:06] why do you think God gets angry
[53:08] sometimes that's why I read that
[53:09] Jeremiah jumped off the page at me don't
[53:12] they know I'm there
[53:14] don't you know the kings in our camp
[53:16] you know God gets angry sometimes it
[53:20] gets angry he gets frustrated he got
[53:22] angry at Moses one time he said why are
[53:24] you crying under me all the time Moses
[53:25] then I give you exactly what you need to
[53:28] fulfill the commission stop crying and
[53:30] complaining all the time go do what I
[53:32] called you to do you've got a Divine
[53:34] Purpose now go do it everything you have
[53:35] need of you got it take it go get out
[53:38] there everything you know oh lord I
[53:41] can't speak or Lord be quiet Moses shut
[53:44] up get going stop it
[53:48] stop looking at all the things you're
[53:49] not start looking at all the things God
[53:51] has already equipped you with him that's
[53:53] the problem with us too carnally minded
[53:56] too carnally minded trying to figure out
[53:58] how to do something or figure out this
[54:00] you know God said not man was never
[54:03] created to shift for himself
[54:05] we were to re totally into completely
[54:08] rely upon God for everything that we
[54:11] have need of in this Earthly Journey oh
[54:14] but oh foolish Galatians what Bewitched
[54:16] you what Bewitched you you know there's
[54:19] a spirit Bewitched his Rebellion to what
[54:22] faith in God's word
[54:23] something bewitches you something pulls
[54:25] you away something tries to pull you
[54:28] away from just simple faith that God
[54:30] will keep his word every promise in the
[54:32] book is for me every promise in the book
[54:35] is for you
[54:36] oh my
[54:38] God I have no idea where I'm at
[54:40] okay let's read a quote and we'll keep
[54:42] on going
[54:44] it is the rising of the sun now the very
[54:47] essence of the message that was sent is
[54:49] this he is risen from the dead and we
[54:52] are his benefactors we who share the
[54:55] resurrection with him and draw benefits
[54:57] from this by providing to the world what
[55:01] uh that he is alive or proving to the
[55:04] world that He Is Alive we cannot do it
[55:06] by word only we cannot do it by some
[55:08] traditions of man we can only reflect
[55:11] the things that we are pointed to
[55:13] everyone
[55:14] my so I think like a like a mirror would
[55:17] reflect the sun let's just stay in the
[55:19] right position let's just stay before
[55:21] the word let the word do the work let's
[55:24] just can let's just commit ourselves to
[55:26] staying in the presence of the word not
[55:28] being pulled away by the man said he's
[55:30] you let so many things take it away from
[55:31] you you let your job you let your wife
[55:33] you let the cares the world you let this
[55:35] problem you let that brother say this
[55:36] about you you let this and you let that
[55:38] and then all of a sudden he pulls you
[55:39] away and you're no longer reflecting the
[55:41] life of God back to the world in which
[55:42] you're living in you let so many things
[55:44] get up get in the way and block the
[55:46] light
[55:47] so let's just get back into position by
[55:50] God's grace get back into position not
[55:51] let anything pull us away from that
[55:53] position
[55:55] he said I'm afraid that we're getting
[55:56] too many people or we're not getting
[55:58] enough people to Christ we're getting
[56:00] them to a church or we're getting them
[56:01] to a theory but we must get them to
[56:03] Christ he is the only one the only one
[56:06] that has life he that hath the son hath
[56:09] life and if the life of a man that is
[56:12] dead be projected in you you will live
[56:15] the same life he lived
[56:18] oh there's the check
[56:20] there's the check there's the mirror now
[56:23] off the same life that he lived is not
[56:25] seen in you then you better see what
[56:27] you're pointing to everyone what are you
[56:29] in line with what are you reflecting if
[56:32] you stay in the presence and the
[56:34] Darkness of this world I promise you you
[56:36] will reflect Darkness to this world but
[56:38] if you stay in the presence of the light
[56:40] you will reflect the life and light of
[56:41] God
[56:42] he says and this is light that he is
[56:45] life that light was his life now if you
[56:49] want to be the light of the world that
[56:50] means the life's going to come into view
[56:52] not just a a correct understanding of a
[56:55] teaching but the literal life of Jesus
[56:57] Christ reflected in me and you the same
[56:59] thing he was I am we are his what
[57:02] benefactors what is this message he is
[57:05] alive how do I know he's expressing his
[57:08] life in me he's expressing his life in
[57:10] you I may not be able to explain
[57:12] everything but by God's grace I'm
[57:15] reflecting something I'm not what I want
[57:17] to be I'm not what I ought to be but by
[57:19] God's grace I am certainly not what I
[57:21] used to be right brother gay it's not
[57:23] him that willeth or him that runeth
[57:24] God's doing something God's quickening
[57:27] God's calling us up higher God knows
[57:29] just the path he's got to take you on to
[57:32] get you into his very own likeness
[57:35] that's the purpose not that we'll know
[57:37] about him but that will know him we've
[57:40] got to know him everyone that's the
[57:42] purpose turn in your Bibles to John 17.
[57:46] John chapter 17 verse 3.
[58:03] it says and this is life eternal that we
[58:07] might Know Thee the only true God and
[58:10] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have
[58:13] glorified thee on the earth I have
[58:15] finished the work which
[58:17] thou gavest me to do
[58:19] and oh Father and now oh Father glorify
[58:23] thou me with thine own self with the
[58:26] glory which I had with thee before the
[58:28] world was that I find to be my continual
[58:31] prayer Lord glorify me May that perfect
[58:35] attribute that Perfect Image that you
[58:37] had of me before the fall and before the
[58:40] world come back into view again Lord
[58:42] restore me bring into view again that
[58:45] which I was in you before the foundation
[58:47] of the world glorify me Lord bring me
[58:50] back into view the real me cause this
[58:52] ain't me this ain't me I promise you
[58:54] this ain't me anybody that knew me 20
[58:55] euros knows this is not the same Kyle
[58:58] that used to live and walk and talk and
[59:00] I'm still not what I want to be but
[59:02] something's happening I'm pressing
[59:04] towards the mark of the High Calling of
[59:05] God wherein I once was not pressing now
[59:08] something's pulling me something's
[59:10] guiding me somebody's got a hold of me
[59:12] taking me places I never thought I could
[59:14] go somebody's got a hold of you taking
[59:16] you a place that you never thought or
[59:18] imagined you could possibly we go how
[59:20] could you an unworthy unrighteous
[59:22] individual ever come back into the
[59:24] presence of a holy God
[59:26] oh it's Grace everyone it's Grace like
[59:30] Isaiah when he got caught up into that
[59:31] Temple and here's the holy cherubins and
[59:33] Pharisees and seraphins and they're all
[59:35] saying holy holy holy so much so when
[59:37] they screamed the pillars of the temple
[59:39] would Shake in his presence that's the
[59:41] Holiness of God as soon as he's in the
[59:43] Holiness of God he falls to the ground
[59:45] like a dead man and says I am a man of
[59:47] unclean lips and I'm living amongst a
[59:49] people of unclean lips oh my oh forgive
[59:52] me no he couldn't do that you know what
[59:54] God did God sent an angel and an angel
[59:56] goes and gets a coal from off the Altar
[59:58] and touches them and says this shall
[59:59] cleanse thee what did Isaiah do he just
[1:00:02] confessed I am unworthy I am filthy I am
[1:00:07] no good then God went to work
[1:00:10] and then after that you know what he
[1:00:12] says and I love it I'm sharing with the
[1:00:14] kids he's standing there he says now
[1:00:16] there's work to be done who shall go for
[1:00:18] us
[1:00:21] where can we find a man
[1:00:26] where's somebody that can bring my will
[1:00:28] into view
[1:00:31] I just wonder
[1:00:33] hmm then Isaiah he's like oh
[1:00:36] hey I'll go send me I'll go now God knew
[1:00:41] he was going to say that
[1:00:43] and so many times God just brings things
[1:00:44] to view and you realize the mercy and
[1:00:46] grace of God he's waiting for a reaction
[1:00:48] to the action he's waiting for you to
[1:00:50] say you know what I'll go Lord if you
[1:00:53] want me to do that I'll do it you want
[1:00:55] me to say something to that person I'll
[1:00:56] say it you you want me to go do that
[1:00:58] I'll do it
[1:00:59] not looking at your ability you got none
[1:01:01] everyone
[1:01:02] not looking at your great intellectual
[1:01:04] Concepts you got nothing
[1:01:06] I've always said the greatest amongst us
[1:01:08] is a bird brain and the only person that
[1:01:10] knows anything God had to give it to him
[1:01:12] if you know anything it was a gift
[1:01:15] you didn't earn it you didn't Merit it
[1:01:16] you didn't figure it out God gave it to
[1:01:18] you how many in here could say I am I I
[1:01:21] want to glory in the fact that I can see
[1:01:24] or I can hear
[1:01:26] you can't God gave you that gift how
[1:01:28] many people were born with no sight
[1:01:30] how many people are born with no hearing
[1:01:32] how many people are born how
[1:01:34] many people died this morning
[1:01:36] how many people won't make it through
[1:01:38] this day
[1:01:40] I would say God's been good to you now
[1:01:43] if that's in the carnal realm of things
[1:01:44] what do you think in the spiritual realm
[1:01:46] of things did not God rich in Mercy come
[1:01:49] down and give you spiritual eyes to see
[1:01:52] where he was in the hour in which we're
[1:01:54] living We're Not Looking Back to a god
[1:01:56] that was we're recognizing the present
[1:01:58] tense I am this is not something to be
[1:02:01] taken lightly and I think God can get
[1:02:03] angry sometimes and say do you not see
[1:02:06] what I'm doing
[1:02:07] can you stop complaining long enough to
[1:02:09] recognize I'm there in the boat with you
[1:02:12] can you not realize I never leave you
[1:02:15] I'll never forsake you I'll be with you
[1:02:17] through the end
[1:02:20] God has a right to get angry sometimes
[1:02:22] with us he's gotten right to get angry
[1:02:24] with me at some times
[1:02:26] he's got that right you imagine a
[1:02:28] husband every day working every day
[1:02:29] paying the bills working hard paying all
[1:02:31] the the light bills electorals and every
[1:02:33] time the wife comes home I'm upset I'm
[1:02:35] nervous I'm scared I don't know the
[1:02:36] light's going to get turned off we're
[1:02:37] going to have enough food
[1:02:39] happen one day you say honey
[1:02:41] stop it happened for three months you
[1:02:44] say honey it's enough
[1:02:46] that's enough
[1:02:49] I will die before I'll let you guys go
[1:02:51] hungry I will die before I let you be
[1:02:54] put out of this home I'll work myself to
[1:02:57] death to see to it that I provide all of
[1:02:59] your needs
[1:03:01] now what do you think God
[1:03:05] you know he's a he's a person
[1:03:07] it's not some Creed I don't love a Creed
[1:03:09] everyone I don't love a doctrinal
[1:03:11] teaching I love a person Jesus Christ
[1:03:13] his character came into view and I've
[1:03:16] seen him for what he is I've seen the
[1:03:18] divine nature of God and I love that
[1:03:20] person I'm unworthy to even walk with
[1:03:22] him but I love him and with everything
[1:03:23] in me I want to walk Closer by his side
[1:03:25] I just want to be in his presence you
[1:03:27] ever have that a real spiritual person
[1:03:29] someone you really love you just want to
[1:03:30] be with them you don't think you have
[1:03:31] anything to offer you just still like to
[1:03:33] be with them that's how it is with God I
[1:03:35] don't feel I have anything I can do for
[1:03:37] God I have you know I remember sitting
[1:03:39] in brother Lonnie's Bible study I was
[1:03:40] like my goodness forgot more than I'll
[1:03:43] ever know and you don't say nothing you
[1:03:45] don't think you could add any value but
[1:03:46] I sure like going to the Bible studies I
[1:03:49] like to be with her I like to hear what
[1:03:50] he was saying I like to hear from that
[1:03:52] experience I sure did that's a man
[1:03:56] what about God
[1:03:57] my goodness you don't think he sits
[1:04:00] there he says my have you not recognized
[1:04:03] do you not see
[1:04:04] is there no bomb in Gilead is there no
[1:04:07] physician have not I given you my word
[1:04:10] have you ever seen my word fail
[1:04:13] have you ever seen me fail Through the
[1:04:15] Bible
[1:04:15] what did I do for Israel
[1:04:17] did I not constantly provide for them
[1:04:19] every day of their life
[1:04:21] and yet they scoffed and complained
[1:04:22] murmured against God
[1:04:25] did not I send them a Vindicated Prophet
[1:04:27] thoroughly Vindicated him then not I do
[1:04:29] these things delivered you from all your
[1:04:31] enemies didn't I do that
[1:04:33] you know God has a right sometimes I
[1:04:35] just burned me up he has a right to say
[1:04:38] hey stop it
[1:04:41] stop complaining
[1:04:44] look to the promises of God try me
[1:04:48] look I love that God says try me test me
[1:04:51] sometime why don't you see if I'll fail
[1:04:54] that's God who said that
[1:04:56] try me you know like any husband you say
[1:04:59] honey give me that bottle of pickles or
[1:05:00] that jar of pickles try me I'll open
[1:05:03] that can you sit there oh boy that is
[1:05:05] done I've had a couple times like hold
[1:05:07] on hold on
[1:05:10] yeah still got it it's the nature of a
[1:05:14] man right
[1:05:15] how much more than nature of God
[1:05:18] oh my he's all power
[1:05:20] there is no such thing I mean
[1:05:22] he defines power he defines strength he
[1:05:26] defines faithfulness he's the definition
[1:05:28] of all those things you shouldn't look
[1:05:30] in the Bible and see uh strength that
[1:05:32] you should see strength is God you
[1:05:34] should see uh when you look at you know
[1:05:35] you look into a dictionary and you say
[1:05:37] oh uh safety well that's God protection
[1:05:39] that's God or Providence oh no that's
[1:05:42] God this interpretation is God and this
[1:05:44] interpretation is God and this
[1:05:45] interpretation god well you begin to
[1:05:47] find out he's all of it he's everything
[1:05:49] he's everything to me is he everything
[1:05:52] to you that's the question he wants to
[1:05:54] be your everything not a part of your
[1:05:56] life your life
[1:05:58] you know Christ in the Bible makes the
[1:06:00] Bible the complete revelation of Christ
[1:06:02] Christ in you
[1:06:03] makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:06:06] entire mystery of God
[1:06:08] men and women yielded surrendered and
[1:06:12] dependent
[1:06:13] the real sign of maturity
[1:06:15] helpless
[1:06:16] dependent upon him for each and every
[1:06:19] day guiding leading and providing
[1:06:22] brother banham says in Christ the
[1:06:24] mystery says first was to express
[1:06:25] himself completely in the threefold
[1:06:28] mystery of God and God in Christ
[1:06:30] secondly to have the preeminances by
[1:06:32] this in his church which is his body the
[1:06:34] bride till he could he could have the
[1:06:37] preeminence to express himself through
[1:06:39] them thirdly
[1:06:41] to restore the kingdom to its rightly
[1:06:44] positioned that fell by sin by the first
[1:06:47] Adam back to where he walked in the cool
[1:06:50] of the evening with his people and
[1:06:53] talked with them and fellowshipped with
[1:06:55] them
[1:06:56] oh we're going back so many times we put
[1:07:00] the third portion of that mystery way
[1:07:01] too far ahead we put it in the
[1:07:03] Millennium and brother sister I'd like
[1:07:04] to say I could be wrong sure looks to me
[1:07:06] like God wants to restore that
[1:07:07] Fellowship right here and right now go
[1:07:10] back to Eden what was it back before
[1:07:12] eating in the cool of the evening God's
[1:07:14] walking with his children walking with
[1:07:17] them talking with them asking them
[1:07:18] questions back in a unity in a
[1:07:20] fellowship and a Oneness with God
[1:07:22] communion again
[1:07:23] where was brother Brandon the last
[1:07:25] sermon communion back in the presence of
[1:07:27] God where's the bride going to be in the
[1:07:28] end back in the presence of God walking
[1:07:30] with him talking with him in the cool of
[1:07:33] this evening hour
[1:07:34] my that's my promise you is that for you
[1:07:37] I promise this for me everyone I believe
[1:07:39] these promises and this message was for
[1:07:41] me I can't I don't Merit it I don't
[1:07:43] deserve it I fail I make way too many
[1:07:45] mistakes I still in my heart believe
[1:07:46] it's for me still believe that I do
[1:07:49] believe that with everything and brother
[1:07:51] band's preaches in 1961 the basis of
[1:07:54] Fellowship he said we find the first
[1:07:55] thing that he tried to do was he tried
[1:07:57] to cover himself with fig leaves do you
[1:07:59] see to make himself now religion is your
[1:08:01] covering we know that that is what it is
[1:08:04] it's a covering the first thing he tried
[1:08:06] to do was to cover himself you see he
[1:08:09] took some aprons from a fig leaf and he
[1:08:11] found he found out that that would not
[1:08:13] work in the presence of God God
[1:08:15] condemned The Works of his hands he just
[1:08:18] wouldn't do it he tried to build a tower
[1:08:21] so he could go and get way up out of the
[1:08:24] way of the floods and out of Destruction
[1:08:25] and find his way back on this Tower and
[1:08:28] babble back to God but God condemned it
[1:08:31] then God confused their languages and
[1:08:33] then the tower dropped and every time
[1:08:35] that man tries to make his own way he
[1:08:38] fails after he lost his fellowship with
[1:08:41] God he became a Wanderer had to shift
[1:08:43] for himself God had taken care of him
[1:08:46] before but now now he finds that he has
[1:08:49] to shift for himself and it's a pretty
[1:08:51] hard thing so he doesn't have a a loving
[1:08:54] father to watch over him or to protect
[1:08:56] him or to guide him or to direct him or
[1:09:00] to feed him or to clothe him and to care
[1:09:03] for him like he did so instead of coming
[1:09:06] back he tries to find his own way he
[1:09:09] wants to make his own way back man wants
[1:09:13] to make his own way back that's how he's
[1:09:16] always been
[1:09:18] wow
[1:09:19] now you see what are you fighting
[1:09:22] against your own religiousness your own
[1:09:25] desire to restore yourself or do
[1:09:28] something add something to the plan of
[1:09:30] God add something to try to bring past
[1:09:33] his will for your life rather than have
[1:09:36] faith in God and trust that he'll guide
[1:09:38] you he'll feed you he'll lead you he'll
[1:09:40] be with you he'll do it all everyone
[1:09:41] that's the promise you read it and I
[1:09:44] read it you'll do it all why are we
[1:09:46] always shifting
[1:09:47] why do we get nervous why do we allow
[1:09:50] fear and worry and doubt take us away
[1:09:53] from faith in God's word
[1:09:55] don't you realize the spirit of the age
[1:09:57] is just trying to get you to not have
[1:09:59] faith in God's word God is his word
[1:10:02] man shall not live by bread alone by
[1:10:03] whatever word that proceedeth out of the
[1:10:05] mouth of God have faith in God
[1:10:08] the very Foundation of this journey
[1:10:10] towards his presence have faith that God
[1:10:12] will keep his word
[1:10:14] God hiding himself in Simplicity 1963 so
[1:10:18] it pleases God to reveal himself and
[1:10:21] then to hide himself and hid himself and
[1:10:24] then reveal himself in the little things
[1:10:25] it just goes right over the head of man
[1:10:28] and you'd say why would a god do that is
[1:10:32] because that man was made up in the
[1:10:34] beginning to not shift for himself a man
[1:10:38] was made to rely completely upon God
[1:10:41] that's the reason we're likened unto
[1:10:43] Lambs or sheeps sheep cannot lead
[1:10:46] themselves he has to have a leader and
[1:10:49] the holy spirit's supposed to lead us so
[1:10:51] man is made that way and God made all of
[1:10:54] his work so simple that the simple could
[1:10:56] understand it and God makes himself
[1:10:58] simple so simple with the simple in
[1:11:02] order to be understood by the simple you
[1:11:04] ever felt so good to be simple
[1:11:07] you ever felt so good to not be
[1:11:08] sufficient never felt so good my God
[1:11:12] went to Great Lengths so that he could
[1:11:14] get to you
[1:11:15] made it so simple that's what I love
[1:11:18] about that brother we baptize he's
[1:11:19] simple
[1:11:20] he just said oh that's what the Bible
[1:11:22] said
[1:11:23] oh Pastor why aren't you baptizing me
[1:11:26] according to the Bible he's not some
[1:11:28] great intellect he saw the light he
[1:11:30] walked in the light and now God will
[1:11:32] lead him into the next step
[1:11:34] stop trying to shift for ourselves
[1:11:35] everyone the bride is not to shift for
[1:11:37] herself the bride should not be shifting
[1:11:39] she shouldn't be trying to figure
[1:11:41] anything out she should have faith in
[1:11:43] God and realize the same God that starts
[1:11:44] this finishes this the same God that lit
[1:11:46] up my path 15 years ago is going to
[1:11:49] light up the path for me tomorrow and
[1:11:51] then the next day and then the next day
[1:11:53] and then the next day he's going to not
[1:11:55] give brother bam said in the Masterpiece
[1:11:56] he said God does not give you so much
[1:11:58] light that you can see the beginning
[1:11:59] from the end
[1:12:00] you do not see the whole picture of God
[1:12:03] I promise you you're not seeing
[1:12:05] everything because that would be
[1:12:07] counteractive to his nature and his
[1:12:09] purpose for Fellowship god brother Byron
[1:12:12] says God gives you just enough light
[1:12:13] like a lantern in your hand to light up
[1:12:15] The Path before you so you can take a
[1:12:18] step in the Darkness
[1:12:19] that's God that's his nature that's his
[1:12:22] character that's the person you know why
[1:12:24] he wants to be your guide
[1:12:27] he wants to be your guide you can't take
[1:12:30] that attribute away from him that
[1:12:32] attribute is a part of God just as God
[1:12:35] is love God is faith God is a guide God
[1:12:38] is a father God is a heavenly father and
[1:12:41] the leader of his church
[1:12:43] a holy ghost filled and led body of
[1:12:47] Believers not resting in their ability
[1:12:49] resting in his ability not having faith
[1:12:52] and confidence in what they can do or
[1:12:54] what they can figure out but faith and
[1:12:56] confidence that God will perform exactly
[1:12:58] what he said he would do that's the
[1:13:01] Church of the Living God it always has
[1:13:02] been you tell me this Hebrew children
[1:13:05] those three Hebrew children down there
[1:13:07] in Babylon they say oh my hey we're
[1:13:09] going to heat up this furnace seven
[1:13:11] times hotter than it's ever been you
[1:13:12] think they sat there and said okay so
[1:13:14] this is what God's going to do
[1:13:16] so we're going to get really close
[1:13:18] everybody behind us is going to die of
[1:13:19] the Heat and when we get in there God's
[1:13:21] going to come down nope
[1:13:23] they didn't know
[1:13:25] they didn't know
[1:13:27] because they had to fulfill the
[1:13:28] scriptures that's part of me everyone
[1:13:30] that furnace was heated up seven times
[1:13:33] hotter this layout to see an age is
[1:13:35] worse than it's ever been the filthy rot
[1:13:37] and nasty Demons of Darkness that around
[1:13:39] you every day and every night there to
[1:13:41] destroy you it's here everyone you have
[1:13:44] arrived
[1:13:45] but he had three faithful children they
[1:13:47] said no matter what we inbound the knee
[1:13:48] no way I don't know how God's going to
[1:13:50] do this I don't know what he's going to
[1:13:51] do but I'm not bowing the knee and if
[1:13:53] this is the place that I die you'll know
[1:13:54] that I died having faith in God and when
[1:13:57] they had faith in God an angel goes I
[1:13:59] think Gabriel or something goes to God
[1:14:00] says Hey God you know what's going on
[1:14:02] down there right
[1:14:03] I just want to make sure it's getting
[1:14:05] pretty pretty close you've been watching
[1:14:07] this he said don't worry sit down worm
[1:14:09] would come sometimes Lord have you have
[1:14:11] you been seen what's happening I just
[1:14:13] want to remind you I know you're busy I
[1:14:14] know you got a lot going on you might
[1:14:15] not have noticed you've got really you
[1:14:17] got three faithful Hebrew or three uh
[1:14:19] faithful Hebrew children down there and
[1:14:21] they're going to burn them up uh that's
[1:14:23] sit down warm one sit down this I go
[1:14:26] myself
[1:14:27] now I've seen the faithfulness of my
[1:14:29] children God was testing his bride for
[1:14:32] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:14:35] him you cannot please him with faith and
[1:14:38] you cannot have faith if you have a
[1:14:40] complete perfect understanding of what
[1:14:41] God's going to do at all times
[1:14:43] you have to have faith you have just
[1:14:45] enough Faith to take that next step
[1:14:49] so God rich in Mercy right when it
[1:14:51] looked like it was their destruction
[1:14:52] they could not they this is it this is
[1:14:55] it we're not bowing the knee but we're
[1:14:56] gonna have faith in God
[1:14:58] came down
[1:15:00] how many times could Jews testify in
[1:15:02] your own Earthly Journey thus far God
[1:15:05] came down
[1:15:07] you know it
[1:15:08] okay
[1:15:10] now that's what he was
[1:15:12] but is that what he is
[1:15:14] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:15:16] and forever
[1:15:17] God rich in Mercy can't change his
[1:15:19] character can't change his nature to the
[1:15:21] same one that came and delivered you
[1:15:22] there he'll deliver you tomorrow he'll
[1:15:24] deliver you next year he'll deliver you
[1:15:25] every day of your life every moment of
[1:15:27] every hour of every second of your life
[1:15:30] he'll be there just call him on the
[1:15:32] scene just have faith in his word
[1:15:34] knowing he's there he promised he'd be
[1:15:37] there I'll never leave you and I'll
[1:15:39] never forsake you
[1:15:41] I think God is trying to awaken you
[1:15:44] to his presence
[1:15:46] I think God's awakening us all to the
[1:15:48] reality that he's here even if he has to
[1:15:52] scold you scold me
[1:15:55] say stop it
[1:15:57] I'm here was this not my promise did not
[1:16:00] I say I would be there did I ever say I
[1:16:03] would let you go into this alone
[1:16:05] no that's what gives us such a faith and
[1:16:08] love and confidence in him he promised
[1:16:10] he would do these things for me
[1:16:13] now brother Branham says again in the
[1:16:15] basis of fellow she said no God laid
[1:16:16] down the program
[1:16:18] in the Garden of Eden and he condemned
[1:16:20] man's work of his hands to begin with as
[1:16:24] soon as man made his first mistake he
[1:16:27] tried to find his way back through a fig
[1:16:29] Leaf religion to get back again and God
[1:16:33] condemned it and what did he do he
[1:16:35] killed some animals and he got some
[1:16:37] sheepskins and I believe it it was I
[1:16:41] believe that's what it was so it shows
[1:16:44] through that
[1:16:45] it takes the blood has always been God's
[1:16:49] program and it always will be God's
[1:16:51] program God in the beginning she laid
[1:16:54] out the program and the only way for
[1:16:57] Fellowship back with God and with one
[1:16:59] another is through the blood of Jesus
[1:17:01] Christ his son he's killing the lamb or
[1:17:04] the sheep and he and the sheepskin
[1:17:06] something had to die for us you can't
[1:17:09] organize it you can't educate it you
[1:17:11] can't scientifically figure it out you
[1:17:14] have to accept it upon the basis of
[1:17:16] faith that something has died for you
[1:17:19] and that brings Fellowship
[1:17:21] amen that brings Fellowship you know
[1:17:24] we're living in an hour right now where
[1:17:26] AI heard of AI artificial intelligence
[1:17:29] brother Brandon preaches in the
[1:17:31] countdown he said you can look at
[1:17:32] science and see where the church is okay
[1:17:34] what is science trying to do through
[1:17:36] there they're building another Tower if
[1:17:37] you hadn't noticed they're building
[1:17:39] another place to not have to come into
[1:17:41] the judgments of God they're trying to
[1:17:42] extend their life they're trying to
[1:17:43] actually become so smart they could take
[1:17:45] their Consciousness and they think
[1:17:47] you're just made up of memory thoughts
[1:17:48] and things of that nature they're trying
[1:17:50] to escape the judgments of God just as
[1:17:52] they were doing back there in the Tower
[1:17:53] of Babel they're doing it again everyone
[1:17:55] and they're connecting with an
[1:17:57] artificial intelligence to make them
[1:17:59] smarter to try to make them live longer
[1:18:01] try to even make it to a point there
[1:18:02] they wouldn't have to die if you go look
[1:18:04] into this I have so it's very
[1:18:06] interesting so what are they trying to
[1:18:08] do they're trying to avoid the judgments
[1:18:11] of God through science and education
[1:18:14] they think they can bypass the plan or
[1:18:17] the headed destruction that they know
[1:18:19] this world is headed in but news flash
[1:18:21] for you that was only showing you where
[1:18:23] the church is there's another artificial
[1:18:25] intelligence here to lead the bride and
[1:18:28] it's not the intelligence of her own
[1:18:29] mind it's the very mind of Christ and
[1:18:31] the leadership of the Holy Ghost to
[1:18:33] guide you to lead you unto all
[1:18:35] righteousness he's foreordained a
[1:18:38] planned and the works that you should
[1:18:39] walk in and the Holy Spirit the little
[1:18:41] Dove was only looking for what everyone
[1:18:44] Lambs
[1:18:47] Lambs he was looking for a lamb because
[1:18:50] the dove can only lead a lamb that's the
[1:18:53] only thing he can lead that's the only
[1:18:55] nature that a dove can rest upon is the
[1:18:57] Lamb and I remember in in the Bible in
[1:19:00] Revelation he says behold the lamb and
[1:19:02] what the Lamb's wife
[1:19:04] so what nature are we going to see
[1:19:06] displayed right now it's going to be the
[1:19:07] aggression the fight we got it figured
[1:19:09] out we know what to do watch out
[1:19:12] forget it
[1:19:13] just forget it
[1:19:15] where's the lamb because only the lamb
[1:19:17] can take the book
[1:19:19] only the lamb can loose the seals
[1:19:21] Revelations 10 verse 8 John takes the
[1:19:24] book
[1:19:25] John eats the book
[1:19:27] and then John through his life Thunders
[1:19:29] out the complete mystery of God as he
[1:19:30] walks it out in everyday dependence upon
[1:19:33] God
[1:19:34] Enoch just walked with God and what did
[1:19:36] he do he brought back into view God's
[1:19:38] mystery Secret
[1:19:40] preeminances in a man just walking in
[1:19:43] the revelation of the word as God showed
[1:19:45] him he walked in it and God showed him
[1:19:47] the next day he walked in it he didn't
[1:19:50] show him the end from the beginning
[1:19:51] but he showed him just enough what he
[1:19:53] needed to see to keep walking with him
[1:19:55] you know God knows how to keep you right
[1:19:57] by his side
[1:19:58] I think that's what he wanted you know
[1:20:00] if you're uh if there's only one light
[1:20:01] and you and your wife are walking
[1:20:03] through the woods you walk real close to
[1:20:05] each other
[1:20:06] if you know there's Cliffs on all sides
[1:20:08] you'll walk right beside your wife or
[1:20:10] whoever's got the light so you can walk
[1:20:12] right with him maybe God rich in Mercy
[1:20:15] and his grace to restore Fellowship he's
[1:20:17] going to make it in such a way we have
[1:20:18] to get real close to him
[1:20:20] it's getting dangerous everyone
[1:20:22] there's traps and potholes everywhere
[1:20:25] it's getting really rough the lights
[1:20:28] just shining I'm gonna have to get real
[1:20:29] close so I don't miss step or fall off
[1:20:31] the cliff here
[1:20:32] God knows exactly what to do to restore
[1:20:35] Fellowship
[1:20:36] because that's his desire
[1:20:38] turn in your Bibles to Second Peter
[1:20:43] second Peter chapter one
[1:20:47] wow you know I'm on page 3 of 12.
[1:20:52] that's a paradox everyone
[1:20:54] I'm usually the guy that has maybe two
[1:20:57] scriptures
[1:20:58] maybe two quotes
[1:21:01] there's no way we'll get through it um
[1:21:03] yeah so second Peter
[1:21:06] chapter 1 verse 2.
[1:21:09] it says Grace and peace be multiplied
[1:21:12] unto you through the knowledge of God
[1:21:14] and of Jesus our lord according as his
[1:21:18] divine power hath given unto us all
[1:21:21] things that pertain unto life and
[1:21:24] godliness
[1:21:26] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:21:28] called us to glory and to Virtue whereby
[1:21:32] are given unto us
[1:21:35] exceedingly great and precious promises
[1:21:38] that by these he might be a partaker of
[1:21:43] what the divine nature having escaped
[1:21:46] the corruption that is in the world
[1:21:48] through lust
[1:21:51] I would say that God's Great purpose was
[1:21:54] this Fellowship in you and I would say
[1:21:57] that the mystery plan of God was to see
[1:21:59] himself in his children
[1:22:01] the very divine nature of God expressed
[1:22:04] in you not the knowledge per se in the
[1:22:08] form of teachings but the knowledge of
[1:22:10] God who expresses himself as the person
[1:22:12] of the word in you I have heard but now
[1:22:15] I see many of us have heard the word but
[1:22:19] now I'm wondering do we see it
[1:22:21] do we see it in US it's got to go from
[1:22:24] something I understand or something I
[1:22:26] can conceptualize or something I could
[1:22:28] even explain to somebody else it's got
[1:22:30] to go from thought to word to word to
[1:22:32] life that's the great condescension of
[1:22:35] God when God came down and found the
[1:22:36] preeminances in a man now it's got to
[1:22:39] find the same path of preeminence is in
[1:22:41] the bride it goes from the thought to
[1:22:43] the word to the word to the life
[1:22:45] and I'm resting in that and my faith is
[1:22:47] built upon that and that's what I want
[1:22:50] to be a partaker of how many of you want
[1:22:52] to be a partaker of I want the part I
[1:22:55] want to partake of the divine nature I
[1:22:56] want the divine nature
[1:22:58] see when I understand his nature then
[1:23:01] things change there's many things that's
[1:23:03] so interesting to me that now we
[1:23:06] couldn't find an exact scripture of it
[1:23:08] but because we're understanding the
[1:23:09] divine nature of God we can say this is
[1:23:11] that or this is that or that doesn't
[1:23:14] match his divine nature and character
[1:23:17] it's very interesting
[1:23:21] next let's slide here
[1:23:24] first John 1 5.
[1:23:26] and this is the message we have heard of
[1:23:28] him and declare unto you God is light
[1:23:30] and in him is no Darkness at all if we
[1:23:33] say that we have fellowship with him
[1:23:35] and we walk in darkness we lie and we do
[1:23:39] not the truth but if we walk in the
[1:23:42] light as he is in the light we have
[1:23:45] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:23:47] blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from
[1:23:49] all sin
[1:23:50] I think God wanted to go on a journey
[1:23:52] with us
[1:23:54] I think even in the life that we have
[1:23:55] even in the mistakes that we make even
[1:23:57] in the disappointments that we would
[1:24:00] disappoint our heavenly father in I
[1:24:02] think he wanted us to learn something I
[1:24:04] think he wanted us to understand him as
[1:24:06] one who would restore us I think he
[1:24:09] wanted us to understand that he was he
[1:24:10] was our great strength there's such a
[1:24:13] walking you see that walking in the
[1:24:15] light and then that's where brother
[1:24:15] Branham says in the Masterpiece he did
[1:24:17] not give us so much light that we see
[1:24:18] the beginning from the end he shows us
[1:24:20] so much light that we have to walk with
[1:24:23] him
[1:24:24] that was his desire that was his basis
[1:24:27] of Fellowship we have to have fellowship
[1:24:29] with him how do we have fellowship with
[1:24:30] him we must walk in the light
[1:24:32] each and every day as he is in the light
[1:24:34] so that those two lives a husband and
[1:24:37] wife can come back in unison again and
[1:24:39] continue this journey back into the
[1:24:41] garden back where there is no more fig
[1:24:43] Leaf religion covering ourselves with
[1:24:45] good works forget about it it's a waste
[1:24:48] of time it's filthy righteousness
[1:24:51] your righteousness is of filthy rags in
[1:24:54] the presence of God Abraham made a lot
[1:24:56] of mistakes but it was an imputed
[1:24:58] righteousness to Abraham because he had
[1:25:00] faith and confidence that the promise
[1:25:02] that God make you would keep his
[1:25:04] promises how many are the children of
[1:25:06] God
[1:25:07] now I don't say that so that you go out
[1:25:09] and do whatever you want because if you
[1:25:10] do whatever you want and sin willfully
[1:25:12] then you prove something's wrong
[1:25:13] everybody
[1:25:14] there should be enough a love of God in
[1:25:16] your heart you wouldn't want to
[1:25:17] disappoint them
[1:25:19] you have such a love for his character
[1:25:20] and of his nature and the more you
[1:25:22] understand of him it motivates you to be
[1:25:24] Desiring to walk with him and do the
[1:25:27] things that you know make him happy
[1:25:29] it's not a fear-based religion this is
[1:25:31] not fear-based this is love based
[1:25:33] everything because remember God wants to
[1:25:35] be loved
[1:25:36] brother bam said it God wants to be
[1:25:38] loved so there you got to bring all this
[1:25:39] into view this is a big objective God
[1:25:42] wants to be loved and if I force love
[1:25:43] it's not love
[1:25:45] if I force you to do anything you're not
[1:25:47] doing it because you love me you're
[1:25:49] doing it because you're afraid of me
[1:25:51] you're afraid of what I will do if you
[1:25:54] don't do it any husband and wife if you
[1:25:57] told your wife if you don't do these
[1:25:59] things I will put you away in
[1:26:00] divorcement then you have to question
[1:26:03] every motive and every objective and
[1:26:05] everything that she does from that point
[1:26:07] on
[1:26:08] now take that back into view you could
[1:26:10] do all the right things you could do
[1:26:13] every code every conduct keep every law
[1:26:15] do it off but for the wrong reason and
[1:26:18] it missed the point it missed the mark
[1:26:20] that wasn't the objective you missed the
[1:26:22] divine nature of God that wasn't his
[1:26:26] divine nature
[1:26:28] then you can do all the right things
[1:26:30] you can make all the right decisions and
[1:26:33] you're doing it because you love the
[1:26:34] Lord
[1:26:35] you're doing it because you want to walk
[1:26:37] with him you're doing it because you
[1:26:38] want to have fellowship with him and the
[1:26:40] Very thought of anything that would
[1:26:41] grieve his presence from you just
[1:26:43] destroys you and then you do do
[1:26:45] something wrong because we all do
[1:26:47] we all make mistakes brother bam said
[1:26:48] when we make big ones
[1:26:51] like getting angry at the neighbor you
[1:26:53] know and stuff like that
[1:26:55] we make big mistakes but then there's
[1:26:57] something to restore that Fellowship
[1:26:59] again there's something that's so longs
[1:27:01] to have that nature and that Spirit next
[1:27:04] to me leading me and guiding me that
[1:27:06] lamb like nature wants that Dove there
[1:27:08] with him at all times everyone that's
[1:27:10] just what the lamb wants the Lamb's
[1:27:13] defenseless a lamb cannot lead itself
[1:27:16] aren't you happy to be the Lambs of God
[1:27:19] how how anybody raise Lambs
[1:27:22] and are lambs smart
[1:27:25] you ever go to the fairgrounds they're
[1:27:28] pretty dumb
[1:27:29] they're not real smart
[1:27:31] they're not
[1:27:33] we're Lambs we're not smart
[1:27:36] we're not great we're not got strong
[1:27:38] defenses
[1:27:39] we don't have great abilities to defend
[1:27:41] ourselves nope we just trust the guide
[1:27:45] that's the bride she just trusts the
[1:27:46] guide
[1:27:47] the guide says that okay I'm just
[1:27:49] standing behind him you imagine a wife
[1:27:51] you know a wife walking through
[1:27:52] somewhere that they don't understand
[1:27:53] what does she do the husband takes her
[1:27:55] hand says all right hold on we're gonna
[1:27:56] cut right through this she gets behind
[1:27:58] her husband
[1:27:59] she just stands right behind him keeps
[1:28:01] all impressing too
[1:28:02] now what would the husband feel like if
[1:28:04] the wife gets in front of the houses now
[1:28:06] I got this
[1:28:08] hold on tight I'm cutting us a path
[1:28:11] right brother Gabe your wife says get
[1:28:13] behind me brother Gabe and get us
[1:28:14] through to the end
[1:28:16] whoa imagine
[1:28:18] he said no way stop that
[1:28:22] sometimes we see the attitude amongst
[1:28:24] the bride that's not a feminist attitude
[1:28:26] that's not a bride-like nature
[1:28:28] I'm not strong in my own ability I'm
[1:28:31] resting in his ability
[1:28:32] he goes before me David said I always
[1:28:35] put the word before me I just keep him
[1:28:37] before me
[1:28:38] that I should not sin against thee
[1:28:42] but go keep going okay all right all
[1:28:45] right we'll keep going
[1:28:48] uh
[1:28:50] brother Brown says in 1959 in reaction
[1:28:53] to an action and you must be sure that
[1:28:56] you're born of the spirit of God and
[1:28:57] that you have the Holy Spirit and that
[1:28:59] the promises of God are all yours and
[1:29:02] you don't care what the devil does and
[1:29:04] you can rest assured that Faith takes in
[1:29:06] its unmovable stand Faith rests upon not
[1:29:10] upon the shifting Sands of man's
[1:29:13] theologies but it takes its solemn stand
[1:29:16] on the Rock of Ages that immovable that
[1:29:19] rest and that Assurance that's God's
[1:29:22] word
[1:29:23] amen
[1:29:24] faith cannot rest on the shifting Sands
[1:29:27] of a man's ideas don't have confidence
[1:29:28] in me I'm a man I'll make mistakes but
[1:29:30] you have confidence in God have
[1:29:32] confidence in his word how many of us
[1:29:34] get are getting smarter as men we're
[1:29:36] learning things we all do we all have to
[1:29:39] go back and repent and say man I didn't
[1:29:40] have that right
[1:29:41] I had that wrong
[1:29:43] I I was because we're men
[1:29:46] we make big mistakes we're learning
[1:29:48] we're growing we're understanding more
[1:29:50] of God As we walk with him an older
[1:29:52] person you could I love talking I like
[1:29:54] old people I like young people sometimes
[1:29:56] too but I like I like older people
[1:29:58] because they've been there they've
[1:29:59] walked with God they've learned things
[1:30:01] about God they're calm they're settled
[1:30:03] sometimes a young person they might be
[1:30:05] more zealous and ego is like they could
[1:30:07] do it they're strong sometimes God just
[1:30:09] has to take them to the place of
[1:30:10] weakness so that they'll actually
[1:30:12] understand it's not me it's just God
[1:30:15] it's just I'm resting in his strength
[1:30:17] and not in my strength oh but I've been
[1:30:20] in that before I I think I can do it
[1:30:22] then I fail miserably I realize I can't
[1:30:24] do it and all of us have been there we
[1:30:26] think we can do it and then we fail men
[1:30:27] certainly realize we can't do it can't
[1:30:30] do it and then he says okay take my hand
[1:30:33] I'll be your guide I love that about him
[1:30:36] my faith is resting on his promises not
[1:30:39] my ability
[1:30:40] Fellowship brother bam says now A man
[1:30:42] was born to have Fellowship man in the
[1:30:44] beginning back in the beginning when we
[1:30:46] had a wonderful Fellowship God would
[1:30:48] come down and have fellowship with his
[1:30:50] man and this woman every evening and the
[1:30:52] cool of evening God would come down
[1:30:53] under the big palm trees and perhaps his
[1:30:56] sacred light and it was shining all
[1:30:58] around Adam and Eve and that great big
[1:31:00] Cathedral there fellowshipping with God
[1:31:02] had nothing to worry about as long as
[1:31:05] they were there fellowshipping with God
[1:31:07] now when God was fellowshipping with
[1:31:09] Adam in the garden Adam had nothing to
[1:31:11] worry about everything was smooth and
[1:31:14] everything was right he didn't have to
[1:31:15] worry about his clothes he didn't have
[1:31:17] to worry about what he ate he didn't
[1:31:18] have to worry about getting sick he
[1:31:20] didn't have to worry about death he
[1:31:22] didn't have to worry about sorrow he
[1:31:24] knew nothing about those things just had
[1:31:26] a freedom like a little child he had a
[1:31:29] heavenly father who was watching over
[1:31:30] him and his Fellowship was with him
[1:31:32] daily he wouldn't be a marvelous thing
[1:31:35] if we could just get back to that again
[1:31:37] and do you know that every redeemed soul
[1:31:40] today that that's living under their
[1:31:42] privileges of that kind of a fellowship
[1:31:45] with God do you know do you know that do
[1:31:47] you believe that God will take care and
[1:31:49] provide of everything that you have need
[1:31:51] of in this Earthly journey and and and
[1:31:54] and and then at the end of the close of
[1:31:57] our old Mortal Tabernacle God has
[1:31:59] promised us to then provide us another
[1:32:01] one he's just saying hey I'm here I'm
[1:32:05] providing everything I'm doing
[1:32:06] everything for you there's nothing to
[1:32:08] worry about and that's the kind of
[1:32:10] Fellowship that he's promised to restore
[1:32:12] for me and you
[1:32:13] no more shifting no more scared no more
[1:32:15] worry no more afraid no more fear no
[1:32:18] more doubt God's in the presence of his
[1:32:21] people this is what he promised he would
[1:32:23] do
[1:32:27] let's see
[1:32:28] Wow way too many notes now I'm nervous
[1:32:30] way too many notes
[1:32:32] can I pull up some stories before you to
[1:32:34] show he's the same yesterday today and
[1:32:36] forever
[1:32:38] let's look at David
[1:32:40] Psalms or Samuel first Samuel 17 44.
[1:32:44] let's look at him because what he was he
[1:32:47] still is
[1:32:48] what he is he will forever be
[1:32:51] first Samuel 17 44
[1:32:55] and the Philistine said to David come to
[1:32:57] me you come to me or you come to me and
[1:33:00] I'll give you this thy flesh unto the
[1:33:02] fowls of the air into the beasts of the
[1:33:04] field then David said to the Philistine
[1:33:06] thou cometh to me with the sword and
[1:33:08] with the spear and with the shield but I
[1:33:11] come to thee in the name of the Lord of
[1:33:12] hosts and the god of the armies of
[1:33:15] Israel whom thou Hast defied this day
[1:33:17] will the Lord deliver thee into my hand
[1:33:20] and I will smite thee and I will take
[1:33:22] thine head from thee and I will give the
[1:33:24] carcass to the host of the Philistines
[1:33:27] this day and unto the fowls of the air
[1:33:29] and to the wild beast of the earth and
[1:33:32] that all the Earth may know that there
[1:33:33] is a God in Israel and all this assembly
[1:33:36] shall know that the Lord saveth not with
[1:33:40] a sword and a spear for the battle is
[1:33:43] the Lord's he will give you into our
[1:33:45] hands amen
[1:33:47] the battle's the Lords it's not him that
[1:33:49] willeth nor him that is running now this
[1:33:52] is his victory this is what I'm resting
[1:33:55] in and just to think about it when
[1:33:56] brother Branham said there he said Saul
[1:33:58] seeing him he tried to he said oh you're
[1:33:59] not ready to meet this giant he said let
[1:34:01] me give you some of my teaching let me
[1:34:02] give you some of my theology he said no
[1:34:04] that ecclesiastical best couldn't fit
[1:34:06] this man of God he said let me go just
[1:34:09] the way I met God he had faith that God
[1:34:12] would deliver him and when he threw it
[1:34:14] all off he had faith in God now his
[1:34:16] confidence wasn't in his sword or his
[1:34:17] spear or his well you would say
[1:34:19] breastplate and all this that Saul had
[1:34:21] nope his faith was in the word and when
[1:34:24] he had complete confidence and faith in
[1:34:26] the word then God took control of that
[1:34:28] man and God guided that stone and God
[1:34:30] knocked that thing down and then God and
[1:34:32] strengthened him to pick up that sword
[1:34:34] and cut off his head
[1:34:36] David had faith in God that's what God
[1:34:39] was looking for not great big strong
[1:34:41] intellectual Giants little Ruddy fellas
[1:34:44] that had faith in God rugged faith that
[1:34:47] God would keep his word that's what he
[1:34:49] wanted
[1:34:50] can I bring up shamgar
[1:34:54] I love shamgar only the prophet of God
[1:34:57] could make us love shamgar so very very
[1:34:59] much
[1:35:01] and to think about it here it goes Trump
[1:35:04] Trump trump right after the Harvest
[1:35:07] right after all that effort here comes
[1:35:09] 600 armed Philistines to take everything
[1:35:12] that he had I seen him look down he
[1:35:15] looked over at his little wife with
[1:35:16] ragged sleeves about naked he looked at
[1:35:18] his little children they were completely
[1:35:20] pale starved to death now these big old
[1:35:23] husky Philistines come in there and take
[1:35:25] what he had got and they would starve in
[1:35:27] the winter it's about like the little
[1:35:29] church today brother pale anemic what we
[1:35:32] need is the courage to take God at his
[1:35:34] word and stand out there and let the old
[1:35:36] robbers come up and run them away now
[1:35:38] sham guard said now looky here I know I
[1:35:41] am not a warrior and I can't fight and
[1:35:44] there are 600 men and that what am I
[1:35:48] going to do I can see him pacing back
[1:35:51] and forth he didn't know what to do
[1:35:52] coming closer Trump trump a few minutes
[1:35:56] and all his oats would be gone his wheat
[1:35:58] his corn everything gone that he had
[1:35:59] laid up for and his family was starve
[1:36:02] everything he had done would be taken
[1:36:03] away in the big taken over to the enemy
[1:36:06] country over there giving away to the
[1:36:08] enemy then the first thing you know God
[1:36:10] began to move on him like that it began
[1:36:12] to get angry my he looked around he
[1:36:15] thought I am an Israelite I am
[1:36:18] circumcised that's the uncircumcised
[1:36:21] Philistine coming up there I'm not a
[1:36:23] soldier and I ain't got time to get out
[1:36:25] here and take some lessons or learn how
[1:36:27] to duel or how to fight but I tell you
[1:36:30] God is my God so he just reached up
[1:36:34] there grabbed an old Ox goad you know
[1:36:36] what an ox goat is a little thing with a
[1:36:37] brass knob on it you beat the cattle
[1:36:39] from the Corral he reached up there got
[1:36:41] the ox go didn't have time to train he
[1:36:43] wasn't some kind of a fighter the
[1:36:45] emergency was at hand and he had to do
[1:36:48] it the brother and brother we ain't got
[1:36:50] time for all these schooling and all
[1:36:52] these other things and teach it this way
[1:36:53] and then teach it that way the time is
[1:36:55] at hand arise take what God has given
[1:36:58] you and let's go men and women are dying
[1:37:00] everywhere he grab that Ox go and he
[1:37:03] jumped out there and he slew 600
[1:37:04] Philistines Hallelujah why he had the
[1:37:07] courage to trust God and to step out
[1:37:09] there not till I learn to go off and to
[1:37:11] learn how to do it oh my God is my
[1:37:13] teacher Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will
[1:37:15] back up his word every time
[1:37:17] amen God will back up his word every
[1:37:20] time and I began to think about it's
[1:37:22] like legitimately I would never stand in
[1:37:24] this Pulpit if I would for one second
[1:37:27] stop and say do I understand everything
[1:37:29] I would never come here I would never do
[1:37:31] it I would never be able to stand the
[1:37:33] criticism and the reproach and the
[1:37:35] rejection I don't have that in me to do
[1:37:37] it but I have confidence that God keeps
[1:37:39] his word I have confidence that this is
[1:37:41] his chosen method that he takes the
[1:37:43] fullness foolishness of a preacher who
[1:37:45] makes mistakes who doesn't have a
[1:37:48] complete understanding of the picture
[1:37:49] and he anoints the man to say just the
[1:37:51] right word at the right time in the
[1:37:52] presence of the right person that can
[1:37:53] just say Amen a little how do you write
[1:37:56] just that's the truth and then God
[1:37:57] brings to past the promises that she
[1:37:59] never thought possible could be
[1:38:00] happening in her life that's God's
[1:38:02] promise and brother banham said he said
[1:38:04] so I just come out here I do the best I
[1:38:06] can and I trust that God takes the
[1:38:08] stones hits the right spots at the right
[1:38:10] time just knows what he's doing that's
[1:38:13] my confidence that's my faith
[1:38:15] and brother banham said he said you know
[1:38:17] what if you're a preacher go preach the
[1:38:19] man said one time to me he said shall we
[1:38:20] go learn all the the doctrines of the
[1:38:22] Creeds the Greeks and they said no no no
[1:38:24] no he said your candle will be half
[1:38:25] burned out by the time you get out there
[1:38:27] he said go take what's in your hand and
[1:38:28] go do something and then brother Brian
[1:38:30] said if you can't preach sing a song
[1:38:32] and if you can't sing like brother
[1:38:33] Isaiah whistle him
[1:38:36] Brother Band said just whistle to him he
[1:38:38] said do something
[1:38:40] do something if you can't sing that's
[1:38:43] fine
[1:38:44] you can't hum that's okay smile
[1:38:48] just be happy
[1:38:50] brother Branham said
[1:38:51] conduct yourself with joy in the midst
[1:38:54] of the trials that what he sees fit to
[1:38:57] bring your way and what are those trials
[1:39:00] he uses them like bits in a horse's
[1:39:02] mouth just to guide you right back into
[1:39:03] his presence again for Fellowship my
[1:39:06] goodness everyone we are the happiest
[1:39:08] people on Earth because we have faith in
[1:39:09] God
[1:39:10] we're not looking at whale's belly we're
[1:39:12] not looking at circumstances we're not
[1:39:14] looking at seaweed and vomit we're
[1:39:15] looking at a promise I will trust in
[1:39:18] thee Thy word will never fail you'll
[1:39:21] never leave me and you'll never forsake
[1:39:22] me his promises are yea and amen
[1:39:29] turn in the Bible if you don't mind
[1:39:32] well you don't have to it's one verse
[1:39:35] Luke 4 4 and Jesus answered saying unto
[1:39:38] him man shall not live by bread alone
[1:39:40] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:39:43] the mouth of God Romans 9 16 it's not
[1:39:46] him that willeth or him that runeth it's
[1:39:49] God that showeth you Mercy
[1:39:51] and we realize that in Philippians I
[1:39:53] want you to turn to Philippians
[1:39:55] chapters 3
[1:39:57] verse 4.
[1:40:01] Philippians 3 chapter or chapter 3 verse
[1:40:04] 4.
[1:40:06] I want to bring into view Paul for a
[1:40:08] second
[1:40:09] a man if any man had confidence or ought
[1:40:11] to have confidence it was Paul
[1:40:14] Paul should have confidence Paul had a
[1:40:15] complete revelation of the mystery of
[1:40:17] Christ
[1:40:18] and Paul if there was one man that could
[1:40:20] boast if one man that could stand with
[1:40:22] the shoulders back and say he has the he
[1:40:24] has the ability to make it this was Paul
[1:40:27] but look at the attitude of Paul in the
[1:40:30] scripture that's not the attitude that's
[1:40:31] not the divine nature attitude of God
[1:40:34] look at his nature he says though I
[1:40:37] might also have confidence in the flesh
[1:40:39] if any other man thinketh that he hath
[1:40:42] whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I am
[1:40:45] more
[1:40:46] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock
[1:40:48] of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and
[1:40:51] Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the
[1:40:53] law of Pharisee concerning Zeal
[1:40:56] persecuting the church touching the
[1:40:58] righteousness which is of the law
[1:40:59] blameless but what things were gained to
[1:41:03] me I have counted loss for Christ yea
[1:41:07] doubtless and I count all things but
[1:41:10] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:41:13] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:41:16] suffered the loss of all things and to
[1:41:19] count them but don't that I may win
[1:41:22] Christ and be found in him not having
[1:41:25] mine own righteousness which is of the
[1:41:28] law but that which is through the Faith
[1:41:31] of Christ the righteousness which is of
[1:41:35] god by faith that I may know him and the
[1:41:39] power of his resurrection and the
[1:41:41] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:41:43] conformable unto his death
[1:41:46] if listen to this if by any means I
[1:41:51] might attain unto the resurrection of
[1:41:53] the Dead did you think Paul would drop
[1:41:56] that in there
[1:41:57] if
[1:41:58] if
[1:41:59] I might Attain
[1:42:01] he realized he's resting in Christ not
[1:42:04] his ability Christ
[1:42:07] not my ability You're Not Strong we're
[1:42:10] not strong people we're not great people
[1:42:12] we just serve a great God
[1:42:15] we serve a great powerful Mighty
[1:42:18] Everlasting nobody to be compared to it
[1:42:21] you should just tell people how great
[1:42:23] God is just keep bragging on him I keep
[1:42:26] bragging on him I like it when my wife
[1:42:28] brags on me
[1:42:29] God certainly likes it when his wife
[1:42:32] brags on him because he's worthy to be
[1:42:34] bragged upon he's worthy to say there's
[1:42:36] no one like him the more I see about him
[1:42:38] his character comes into view there's no
[1:42:40] one like him no one like him then it's
[1:42:43] real easy to tell people about him
[1:42:45] because then you're just bragging on
[1:42:46] Christ just bragging upon the
[1:42:48] Everlasting presence of Jesus Christ
[1:42:51] amongst his people that's his promise
[1:42:54] not as though I have already attained
[1:42:57] either were already perfect but I'm
[1:43:01] following after if that I may apprehend
[1:43:04] that for which also I am apprehended of
[1:43:08] Christ Jesus
[1:43:09] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:43:12] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:43:14] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:43:16] and reaching forth to those things which
[1:43:18] are before I press towards the mark of
[1:43:21] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:43:24] Christ Jesus
[1:43:26] Paul never lost that attitude to reach
[1:43:28] out to apprehend the thing that
[1:43:30] apprehended him
[1:43:32] I don't think we ought to either
[1:43:34] let's not be too confident let's not be
[1:43:36] too proud let's not become arrogant
[1:43:38] let's become humble
[1:43:41] become little see how little you can be
[1:43:44] remember if you'll obey yourself God
[1:43:46] will exalt thee in due time will you
[1:43:49] stand with me musicians will you come
[1:44:07] I hope that wasn't too hard
[1:44:10] I'm sorry
[1:44:11] something just there in the beginning
[1:44:14] you get to wondering
[1:44:17] um
[1:44:18] yeah
[1:44:20] we serve a great God
[1:44:22] we serving Almighty omniscient God he
[1:44:26] provided everything that I had need of
[1:44:28] for this Earthly journey and my big
[1:44:30] mistake was when I thought I could do it
[1:44:31] on my own
[1:44:32] that's our big mistakes that we've made
[1:44:34] when we get overconfident you know
[1:44:36] Samson
[1:44:38] got a little overconfident
[1:44:40] there was a woman that came in one day
[1:44:42] and flattered him told him how great he
[1:44:44] was ooh you know he wasn't quite used to
[1:44:47] that attention he said you know what I
[1:44:49] am pretty great yeah you know I am see
[1:44:52] what the devil was up to
[1:44:55] tempting him yeah I'm a powerful being
[1:44:58] yeah
[1:44:59] I did do that to those Philistines look
[1:45:02] at me
[1:45:04] what
[1:45:06] he forgot where his strength came from
[1:45:09] bride
[1:45:11] don't forget where your strength comes
[1:45:13] from
[1:45:14] it ain't you
[1:45:16] it ain't you God sure knows how to make
[1:45:20] sure you realize it's not you at times
[1:45:22] he's certainly good at that
[1:45:25] but it's gone
[1:45:28] when that woman came in and started
[1:45:29] flattering him making him feel real
[1:45:31] special making him think it was him boy
[1:45:35] what did he do he got him separated from
[1:45:38] those Seven Locks which what were they
[1:45:39] brother Benham said that was the
[1:45:41] Covenant of God's word he separated him
[1:45:44] from the word and there his strength
[1:45:46] went away
[1:45:47] the devil slick is a subtle enemy he's
[1:45:51] very slick remember wherever the spirit
[1:45:54] of God is the Antichrist spirit's really
[1:45:56] close
[1:45:58] brother Branham said those trees
[1:45:59] branches were intertwined in the garden
[1:46:02] my they're close
[1:46:04] I always thought that with brother
[1:46:05] Brown's telling brother Jeremy I'd look
[1:46:06] at brother Brown brother bams get to ask
[1:46:08] the question she says brother Benham
[1:46:09] could you be Christ
[1:46:10] he says now sister
[1:46:12] in one way
[1:46:15] that's absolutely the truth but in
[1:46:17] another way you make me an antichrist
[1:46:20] bride be careful
[1:46:22] just be real careful in one way you are
[1:46:26] the very righteousness and display of
[1:46:28] God but be careful
[1:46:30] in another way you could become
[1:46:32] Antichrist
[1:46:34] I know that's hard I know that's a
[1:46:36] strong statement but you have to
[1:46:37] understand the Spirit by which I'm
[1:46:38] saying it
[1:46:40] remember our help and our strength
[1:46:42] Cometh From The Lord
[1:46:44] my hopes are built on nothing less than
[1:46:47] Jesus words of righteousness all other
[1:46:50] ground is sinking sand I can't put my
[1:46:52] faith in any place else but his word
[1:46:57] sing us that song brother
[1:47:00] my hopes are built a solid rock

[1:47:09] than Jesus blood and righteousness

[1:50:34] Heavenly Father we come before you now
[1:50:37] even myself I'm convicted
[1:50:40] even myself father I realized I put too
[1:50:43] much confidence in myself at times
[1:50:47] father I just first asked for
[1:50:49] forgiveness myself personally
[1:50:52] Lord forgive us as an assembly forgive
[1:50:54] us as a people
[1:50:56] forgive us Lord for the subtlety of the
[1:50:58] enemy Lord that would come in and try to
[1:51:00] exalt ourselves above our measure
[1:51:02] forgive us father Lord for not having
[1:51:04] faith and confidence in your promised
[1:51:06] word
[1:51:07] Lord I pray that you would help us
[1:51:10] Lord I pray that you'd help me
[1:51:12] pray Lord that you would take our hands
[1:51:14] and I pray Lord that you would help me
[1:51:15] to firmly stand behind thee and not in
[1:51:18] front of Thee
[1:51:19] Lord lead us and guide us that's my
[1:51:22] prayer
[1:51:23] Lord search our hearts as individuals
[1:51:26] father
[1:51:27] we are individuals standing before you
[1:51:29] Lord
[1:51:30] you know every secret chamber you know
[1:51:32] every hidden thing you know every motive
[1:51:35] and every objective why we do what we do
[1:51:38] father your word said you would cut like
[1:51:41] a two-edged sword even to the dividing
[1:51:44] of asunder between the spirit and the
[1:51:46] soul
[1:51:46] Lord I believe that word has cut I
[1:51:50] believe it went way down deep sometimes
[1:51:52] Discerning between what's
[1:51:55] ought to be there and what's not
[1:51:57] Lord I just pray that you would help us
[1:51:59] as individuals
[1:52:01] Lord we want to say we're thankful
[1:52:04] thank you Lord thank you for what you've
[1:52:07] started in us thank you for your grace
[1:52:10] thank you for your free gift of
[1:52:12] Salvation not of Works lest any man
[1:52:15] should boast thank you for Faith father
[1:52:18] in our hearts to believe you
[1:52:20] thank you Lord for shining the light
[1:52:22] before our path
[1:52:24] thank you Lord that you keep the light
[1:52:26] not showing the whole path thank you
[1:52:29] Lord for just the step right in front of
[1:52:31] us
[1:52:31] Lord we know you're holding that Lantern
[1:52:33] in your hand
[1:52:35] and Lord we want to just walk real close
[1:52:37] to you father wherever that light
[1:52:39] wherever that path leads we just want to
[1:52:41] be found walking with you father
[1:52:43] so Lord God may you become
[1:52:46] our everything
[1:52:48] no longer a part of our life but our
[1:52:50] life
[1:52:51] Lord whatever hindrances and whatever
[1:52:54] things that are trying to take us away
[1:52:56] from the reality of what you're trying
[1:52:57] to get across to your church
[1:52:59] pray Lord that you would remove it
[1:53:02] Lord I pray as we as individuals
[1:53:04] sometimes your prophet of God said
[1:53:06] you're there and then you'll hide
[1:53:08] and then you'll come back and then
[1:53:10] you'll hide again like in Song of
[1:53:11] Solomon knocking at the door and then
[1:53:13] the bride running out and can't find her
[1:53:15] where'd he go what's going on
[1:53:18] Lord I believe you want to be pursued
[1:53:20] I believe you want a bride that comes
[1:53:22] after after you
[1:53:24] so Lord God if We've ran after the
[1:53:26] things of the world that cares of this
[1:53:27] world or something like a fig Leaf
[1:53:29] religion forgive us father
[1:53:32] Lord we want to walk with you you are
[1:53:34] our righteousness
[1:53:36] Lord the word is our clothing and it's
[1:53:40] an imputed righteousness not earned Lord
[1:53:43] it was your grace
[1:53:45] father forgive us
[1:53:47] if we should be that which is O foolish
[1:53:49] Galatians forgive us
[1:53:52] Lord we came out by the hearing of Faith
[1:53:54] Lord in this journey we'll continue this
[1:53:57] journey by faith in your word
[1:53:59] Lord if we build our house upon sand
[1:54:01] shifting Sands of man's ideas forgive us
[1:54:05] Lord may we find ourselves
[1:54:06] re-establishing our lives upon the solid
[1:54:09] Bedrock of your word

[1:54:31] faith that we have to point others in
