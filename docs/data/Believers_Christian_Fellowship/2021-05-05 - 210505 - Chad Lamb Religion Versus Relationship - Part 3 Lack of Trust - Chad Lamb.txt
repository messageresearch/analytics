see you on your feet and looking strong and healthy amen god is good praise the lord amen we're going to keep going in genesis and we're going to stick with this subject that we're on this will be part three religion versus relationship the last time i said there was going to be a long title you know i kind of bragged a little bit about having a long title but i never got to it so god had the last laugh so i was going to preach last time on um misunderstood mercy and a lack of trust and i never got to the lack of trust so the last time was just misunderstood mercy and by god's grace today we hope to preach on a lack of trust so god burst my bubble on having a nice preacher-sized title so we went to part three of religion versus relationship a lack of trust we just pray that god will bless us now let's let's read here in genesis chapter three we've been starting here each time but i just don't want to get away from this foundation but i want to back up just a little bit and start at verse 1 this time i'm sorry yeah i'm going to start at verse 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god does know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and that they and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the of of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called him to adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and let's just bow our heads and ask the lord to bless his word dear lord jesus we thank you father for the privilege lord of standing here again today you've kept us lord we thank you for restoring health and strength to our brother manuel that he could make the journey to be here nor we thank you god for what you're doing in our lives as you're lifting us higher and higher by the word and we're going up word by word lord and may this evening may you unveil more of yourself to us and may we see you lord clearly for who you are god feed us by your own hand lord have preeminence among us and speak your words give us eyes to see lord that we might see all you have for us we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen you can all be seated i'm going to read just a couple of quotes that we've been reading just to bring us back in context here but in the message god hiding himself in simplicity in 1963 the prophet of god said in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man he always he's always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion that's been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion so i want you to recognize in this quote like we've been saying man has always tried to hide from god so his religion was a covering that he could hide from god and so the religion in the beginning was never intended to bring him into the presence of god or bring him in contact with god it was actually a barrier between him and god so he's always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion so man is born with a guilty conscience fallen man is born with a guilty conscience and goes through life and he's knowing he knows that he's guilty and he knows that he's wrong amen there's a sense that he's wrong and he's always trying to find a way to cover his guilty conscience amen he wants to feel justified he wants to feel okay and so religion is a mechanism that the devil uses so readily to calm that quiet that guiltiness quiet that reservation in the heart of man so that he feels justified he feels that he's okay and if i've said it i don't know how many times i've said it yet and i don't know in what ways because it's it's so full in my heart but but man is is trying to feel justified he wants to feel that he's okay so religion will produce a covering without an atonement there's no shedding of blood there's nothing to take away a sin there's just a covering so that he could feel covered and justified free from the judgment of god and it actually prevents man from seeking god and because of religion man doesn't need god because the religion has caused him to feel justified in the message fellowship the prophet of god says then god made a remedy for that in closing i might say this in the garden of eden when god saw that his children had sin and had gone from him god himself who is the supreme judge made a reconciliation so he could restore that fellowship to his creatures by the shed blood of an animal and that shed blood lasted for many years speaking of the coming of christ so we see the difference in the relationship of a father amen trying to bring amen an atonement a sacrifice to for his children he wasn't bringing them a religious order he wasn't bringing them a sacrament amen that would that would bring a covering so that they could feel justified he was actually bringing something that would restore fellowship because god wanted to restore fellowship with his children so you see the two different sides of this that's why i've been calling this religion versus relationship because man made his own covering he made his own apron covering his own religion to hide his sin amen to make him fee itself feel justified like he's okay but god the father come down and he was not going to let his son stay behind those coverings so he came as a voice walking in the garden in the cool of the evening and that voice made made adam realize that he was naked his his coverings was not working amen and he hid himself from god so his religion kept him hidden from god but god gave a an atonement that would bring a reconciliation a restored fellowship so these are the principles that we're wanting to build on in the message the super sign he said adam he tried to make a super religion without an atonement they're still trying to do it a super religion make a religion so he could live any way he wanted to without an atonement and still have a covering he tried to do it in the beginning and he is still trying to do it then in the message the indictment he makes a statement i'm just going to pull out these two sentences he said that's the reason that you don't see these things happening in the churches they confess they believe the blood which would be the atonement so they confess that they believe in the atonement but they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word so god has made an atonement for his fallen children and that atonement was the sacrifice jesus made at calvary the shedding of blood amen as an atonement that would be the covering for our sins and now the religious order of the day the christian religious order of the day they say that they believe in that blood and they believe that blood is the atonement yet they've cut the people off from the path to that blood because the path to the blood is the word amen and when you when you deny the word amen how can you receive the life that was in the blood which is the life of the word amen if you've if you deny the very word which is christ so so now they they say they believe the blood but reject the very plan to get to the blood the word in the message titled the god of this evil age says now notice cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice he come down and offered the fruit or the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious done everything that just exactly like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word there's the key he had a religious order he had a worship he had a desire to worship he had a love for god that's what brother bam says it wasn't that he didn't have a love for god the problem is he loved himself more than he loved god it wasn't that he didn't love god and it's not that people are out here worshiping it's not that they don't love god amen the problem is they love themselves more than they love god and this is the fallacy of man this is what we have to guard against maybe that god gets preeminence first place that's what he's wanting that was his desire that was his plan and as his plan unfolded they had a three-phase purpose to his plan one was to get preeminence in a man he wanted a man that would love god more than he loved himself then he would preeminence in a bride a church a body amen and he wanted a people that would love him more than they love themselves and this has been the whole plan he goes on in and the god of this evil is to say and the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god so that's the thing that matters it mattered in that day with abel and it matters today the revelation by the word of god because the word is the path to the blood to the atonement that will bring us back in reconciliation back in fellowship with god let's go look at genesis chapter 4 again genesis chapter 4 we'll begin at verse 10. i am going back and rev viewing a little bit from sunday so that we can continue on i told you at the beginning of this i made a commitment uh to myself that i was not going to rush and that means we go back over a little bit we'll go back over a little bit but i'm not going to get in a hurry it's always my problem my my the thing that i've always struggled with and preaching is i always feel like i try to put too much into one service and i'm just going to take my time now amen if you'll bear with me so if you say brother ted we've heard this again i know but just be patient with me genesis chapter 4 verse 10 and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and now with thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tilt the ground it shall know not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the in the earth and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy faith shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me and the lord said unto him therefore therefore whosoever slayeth came vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him so now we we want to just review from last sunday that that you know we know that cain had a discussion with abel god had admonished cain for having his countenance fallen and and being wrothful with god over god rejecting his sacrifice and he said just if you do well will it go well with thee amen and and brother brahm tells us he told him just do as your brother abel just repeat what you saw amen but but he couldn't do it and when he had a conversation with abel whatever abel told him and we know abel had the revelation of what went wrong in the garden because he had the revelation of a blood atonement and so whatever conversation they had made cain so angry that he slew his brother and now when god comes to him to correct him he lies to god and it's just showing the nature of the serpent seed that cain amen had a nature that would defy god and that was the kind of nature that lucifer had in the rebellion in heaven and now that nature is found on earth in humanity and and god says where is thy brother abel and he says i don't know he's lying he said i'm on my brother's keeper and go and god begins to tell him he knows he identifies what happened he unveils the whole thing and he and he curses cain and he says that shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth it'll no longer yield her strength when thou tilt the ground and he put a curse and instead of cain becoming humble and repentant amen he becomes more defiant he's still wrathful he's still angry and he and he speaks back to god and he and he calls god unjust because he says my punishment is more than i can bear and so the the point that we want to get to here is remind you that then god he says my punishment is more than i can bear for i will be a fugitive and the vagabond in the earth and it'll come to pass that anybody who finds me everyone that'll find me will slay me and the lord said in verse 15 the lord said therefore whosoever slave cain vincent shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any find him shall kill him and so now it looks as though that god is agreeing with cain that your punishment is too much and you know they find you say okay cain you've got a point now i'm going to put protection upon cain and whoever slays cain vinji shall be taken on them sevenfold and he put a mark upon cain the mark of the beast lest any finding him should kill him so immediately what we identify as the mark of the beast and for us we know to be such a wicked evil thing if you go back in this day decaying the mark that was a put upon him was a mark for protection and the mark of the beast protected cain so you can see how he can misunderstand this mark the mark would protect him from anybody else harming him so it was god who put the mark upon him and the mark that god put on him was a mark of protection and god amen god put a curse upon anybody that would harm him so it's almost as if god is standing up for cain or defending he is defending him against being slain then verse 16 and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of the son enoch so here we see that he went out from the presence of the lord and he was fine going out from the presence of the lord going out from the presence of the lord didn't grieve cain losing his life upon the earth grieved him but being a vagabond and a fugitive grieved him amen but going on from the presence of the lord now he goes out from the presence of the lord he goes to the land of nod he has a son and he begins to establish he begins to build a city and this building a city means to establish amen or to cause to continue so now his very action that he's taking is defying the very curse that god put upon him because this curse to be a fugitive in a vagabond means that he would be unstable unsettled amen and he would wonder about amen and so there was going to be no stability to cain so cain goes out to the land of none which is wandering he take he he knows his wife he has a son and he starts to build a city or he starts to be established and caused to continue it looks like he's putting down roots amen so we find that that now this line of cane they become those who are uh in the arts they begin to uh bring out metallurgy they begin to make craft they begin to prosper they begin to build cities uh they begin to have trade and industry and all of these things and science and art and achievement all came through the line of cane so it looks like they're blessed it looks like they're the ones who are blessed seth brother tells us seth continues to be a a herdsman a men following the flock living in tents amen living in small family groups and moving about and following the herd it looks like seth's line are the wanderers and it looks like cain's line are the ones who are established in the earth and it looks like they're the ones who are blessed it just shows how the carnal mind gets the things of god so absolutely topsy-turvy and backwards because to be established amen is to be established in the word amen and it said that cessne after he had a son amen then men begin to call on the name of the lord then seth as he was wandering about in enos and this and the righteous line was wandering about following the herd and following the flocks and farming and and following them as they go to pasture grazing as they were moving about on the earth they were seeking the name of the lord amen and they were becoming established established in the faith established as the righteous line of god but in humility amen not in science not in achievement not in building the cities and it just goes to show that there's no security in that amen there's no stability in that that you can have a city you can have a walled city and be a fugitive and a vagabond upon this earth you can have a fat bank account and a good job and a house that's paid for and if you don't seek the name of the lord and have no relationship with god you are a fugitive and a vagabond upon this earth you are unstable unsettled wavering about wandering from place to place but cain never stopped being religious he continued to worship amen the prophet of god tells us these things he continues to worship he continues to be religious he continues his religious practices amen but they're unstable they're unsteady now he begins to fashion more imaginary ways to worship more rituals and sacrifices and gods and idols and all of these things because he's a fugitive and a vagabond and so it works down cain's line and and i just presented to you this way can you see how it'd be possible to be in cain's line and believe that you were the righteous line to be in cain's line with the cities and the scientific advancement and the and the growing uh the growing of merchandise and trade and industry and arts and music and building in your cities your temples and your places of worship and all the metal that goes to to start digging out gold and precious gems and all of the things that they're mining out of the earth to create a house of worship and where you can look out at seth and you can see that they don't have a temple they don't have a method for worship they don't have an idol they bow to or a place to burn in censor they just move amen following the herds and following the flocks now you can be in king's line and generationally coming down and believe that this mark that was put upon cain is a protection for cain and cain's line that we've been marked by god who marked them god why did god mark him to protect him now you can see how this mercy can be misunderstood god did it for his own purpose but they begin to misunderstand i want to drop down to lamech now and see this attitude this approach verse 23 and lamech said unto his wives ada and zela hear me hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i've slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my heart if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech 70 and sevenfold and all of a sudden he's looking back at what happened with cain as though it's a good thing amen now god would avenge anybody that would destroy cain and here i am i've come down from cain i'm in this lineage and if if god will do that for cain then what will he do for me if he'll avenge cain sevenfold then we'll eventually make seventy times seven fold and you can see by his very attitude and his very approach that he believes he's righteous and he believes he's justified and he's justified in all these things and if god will do that for cain then he'll do this for me and lost sight that this was the rebellion against god but i just want to point out that when you count the genealogies lamech would be the seventh in the line of the unrighteous seed and the serpent seed because when you get to enoch enoch is the seventh from adam we know that lamech doesn't come from adam lamech would come down that line from the serpent but he comes in the seventh he's the seventh generation just like enoch would be the seventh generation from adam amen so you would go serpent to cain and all the way down through until you come to lamech the seventh and he's a type of the seventh apostate church he's a type of the seventh church age let's go pick this up in revelation chapter three everything in the bible is for a reason so now we come to the seventh amen and it's amazing that in the record of the bible and the record of cain's line it stops right here with lamech it doesn't go on it goes to the seventh which is going to type the seventh church age or i'd say the seventh apostate church because the church ages is the weaving together amen of two vines the righteous vine and the unrighteous amen there's a weaving together of the true and the false vine through the church ages and so now we know there's a true church and there's an apostate church amen in every church age so lamech would be a type of the apostate church and when we come to revelation chapter 3 verse 17 he says because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest thou not thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now you find the seventh apostate church in the same condition lamech was in lamech thought he was righteous and the lamech thought he was justified and lamech thought god would stand up for him but it was after this generation that the flood would come and they would all be destroyed but he thought that god would stand up for him let's pick it up in verse 18 let's read revelation 18 2 and see this condition of this church in the end time revelation 18 and 7 how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong as the lord who judgeth her it's the same attitude it's the same approach amen this is the false church at the end she she she she has glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saved in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow she did not see her condition she saw herself righteous she saw herself married to christ the queen of heaven she said i am no widow and i will see no sorrow and it was in that very day that she makes this declaration amen that her her plague shall come in one hour that she will be destroyed and this is speaking of the seventh apostate church are the church in the seventh church age they come to the front where they think they're righteous they're in the righteous line they're the righteous seed that god is sticking up for them god is blessing them and they're misunderstanding the mercy of god because god sends the rain on the just and the unjust and the rain falling and the blessings coming is no indication of what is in the root of that seed amen just because god is a good god and his blessings continue to pour upon this earth amen and he continues to heal and he continues to deliver and he continues to supply amen and when the rain falls brother branham said he saw in the vision there was a wheat and then that wheat had tares and in that wheat and the field had wheat and the field had tears amen and all of a sudden they were all hanging their heads and there was a drought and they needed rain and he said and a good revival rain came sweeping through there and the rain come from god by the mercy of god and the rain fell on the whole field and he said and the wheat lifted up their heads and said glory to god praise the lord and the tares lifted up their heads and say glory to god praise the lord so the mercies of god and the blessings of god are no indication of righteousness and that was the mistake lamech lamech was in a cursed line amen but he was protected by god and there was blessings carnal blessings poured upon this line and he thought surely god won't destroy me surely god won't judge me i sit a queen and am no widow i'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest thou not you're in the unrighteous line you're the false vine and this is the day of your destruction lamech who thought god would stick up for him was the very generation that would be wiped out by a flood praise be to god so it doesn't matter i shouldn't say it like that but you cannot take the mercy and blessings of god as an indication or a security that you're right with god you cannot take the the the blessings and the mercy the rain that pours on the just and the unjust and you cannot claim that amen somehow is a justification that you're right with god because the laodicean church the apostate church thought she was rich and increased with goods and had need of nothing and didn't know that her spiritual condition was miserable poor wretched blind and naked so we cannot look to the carnal things we cannot look to the blessings amen we must look to the word of god because god's plan from the beginning was the was the revelation of the word and god gave his word he meant to his children and his children followed his word let's continue on in the message satan's eden so but now the cunningness of the devil now makes the people believe that they are christians when they're not further on he says and that's why satan has done this and he has worked through the ministry to do it as god promised he would do now he begin by a religious deceit in eden and has continued ever since not by setting up a bunch of communists communist has nothing to do with this it's the church that's where you have to watch see it's not the communists that would deceive the very elect it's the church that'll deceive the very elect oh this is a big statement amen where's the deception come from it comes from the church amen it comes from the false vine it comes from the church it comes from that religious system amen not from something else it comes from the religious system he says there's a church that'll deceive the very lexi it isn't communism we know that they deny god and their antichrist sure they are in principle but they are not the antichrist the antichrist is religious very religious so the antichrist is religious very religious and can quote the scripture and make it look so plain so when we're looking for the antichrist don't be looking amen don't don't don't be out there looking for the bum on the street or the harlot or the prostitute i mean that's not the antichrist the antichrist is religious very religious and can quote the scripture and make it look so plain let's go to back to genesis go to genesis chapter 6. just keep going here through the book of genesis in genesis chapter 6 verse 1 it says and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wise of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years so these two lines were moving on down through time and generations were coming and going and and they were the one line was building cities and doing all the things that they were doing and god just let it go because cess line was calling on the name of the lord and god was not intervening in whatever cain and all of his were doing and all the science and the arts and the music and the cities and he wasn't intervening in that amen but when now when the sons of god began to mingle with these two lines god was going to come down and put a stop to it right now because god this is not what god wants god wanted to separate out his children and he wanted his children to be in fellowship with him in communion with him he didn't want him to get back mixed in with this and when they began to get mixed in then god come down and put a stop to it now let's go to verse nine then we know the story of the flood and i'm not going to get into that uh not today but anyways god god he saw the wickedness man was great and everything they imagined in their heart was evil continually and he repented that he had made man upon the earth and he was going to destroy it but noah found grace in his eyes and god was going to make a way of escape through the ark and he gave no instructions on how to build the ark and the ark was nothing more than the word for their day [Music] i just want to i want to drive that home i want to drive at home so such a reality amen until the the bible comes alive today that the ark was the manifested word for their day because what god made in the form of protection amen was pointing all the way over to the new testament amen because what he made was an ark with three levels because brother branham said that's my ministry justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost but at the top amen there was a window amen and that window amen was a window unto heaven and through that window would come the message of salvation the message that the judgment has passed so the whole ark was even speaking the word of god it wasn't just a boat amen the whole construction of it amen was you work your way up and then the small window up to heaven amen was all speaking of justification sanctification the baptism holy ghost and a door open in heaven in the laodicean church age so this this whole ark was given the word was given through a prophet amen and it was given out to the people and and brother brandon said this it wasn't something that was done in a corner you couldn't hide that boat it was huge the the world at that time knew what was going on amen and brother bam says many many things about that but the way of salvation was going to be to come into the manifested word for that day and it was going to be the only way it didn't matter what you thought about it and then it didn't matter if you thought it was a good idea a bad idea whether noah was a good person a bad person it didn't matter what you thought about noah what you thought about noah's family what you thought about his carpentry skills none of that mattered for noah had the word of god for his day amen and noah believing that word it was righteous and in the righteous line amen and it was an opportunity for whosoever will to come to the word but the only ones who would come are the ones who are ordained to so what god has done in the bible has been the same story over and over and over and over again changes the names of the characters changes the circumstances you know changes it from a boat to an exodus journey to a king to but it's the same story over and over again so now they they they uh have the judgment the floods come and they destroy and then they destroy everything but but the souls that were in this boat which was noah and his three sons and their wives amen and then then the they're there and after the judgments passed we know all of that but then they come out upon the earth and we're going to come to revelation chapter 9. revelation chapter 9 and we'll read verse 1 and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth now when they come out of the ark god is going to give them their instructions for this new dispensation and now what comes out is noah and his three sons and their wives and then all the animals that were with them on the ark and now they come out and he gives them this commandment it says be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth now that becomes the word for their day now let's go down to verse 7 it says and you be fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein so what god wants to do god wants them to go forth here from mount ararat and he wants them to go out and replenish the earth he wants them to multiply abundantly upon the earth because god always wanted to fill the earth with his sons and daughters that was god's plan from the beginning and and now he tells him to go out and multiply and replenish he goes bring forth abundantly upon the earth so he wants him to go from there and he wants him to go and fill the earth praise god so i want that i want that to lock in that's the word for the day now let's skip over to genesis chapter 10 and start reading in verse 8. there's another character we've got to bring in verse 8 and cush begotten nimrod now kush is the son of ham and him was the son of noah so nobody got ham hamburg cush and it says and cush begotten nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and eric and akkad and kaunai in the land of shinar out of that land went forth asher and built in nineveh and the city rehab off and kayla and resin between nineveh and kela the same as a great city so now when we get into the genealogies amen they're just running through this one we got this one we got this one we got this one and all of a sudden there's an insertion here of this character named nimrod and so much is said about him in comparison to what's said about everybody else because what's said about everybody else is almost nothing but now nimrod began to be a mighty one a great one upon the earth he began to be a mighty hunter before the lord amen and he went out and he began to build a kingdom and it started at babel and from there he conquered shinar and all of assyria and he had a mighty kingdom so this is the this is the the first one that's mentioned that has a large kingdom upon the earth or is going to be a mighty king upon the earth and has a large that's a that's that's almost all of mesopotamia so it's a huge area that he was going to rule over there's a reason it's in the bible like that brother banham said in the message israel in the church from 1953 he said for this is the day brethren you'll bear me record a day of isms i've been studying genesis now for two years of genesis that's the beginning the going forth to seed chapter and notice that all these cults of this day are beginning in genesis and had their start back in genesis winding up out here in the last day for instance many of them like how the formal religion began and came how it come on out out and come down through the sons of noah ham out of ham he had nimrod nimrod built the tower of babel babel comes on down through king nebuchadnezzar's time and on out into revelations babylon how that little seed started way back there at the east side of the gates of eden come on down winding out all kinds of cults and everything started back there winding themselves out to the end now what brother benham just gave us here in this quote in 1953 he just gave us the whole path of the of the of the devil amen and the devil's religion all the way back from something that started as a seed on the eastern at the eastern gate at the east of of eden when cain and abel come to bring their offerings amen one started a man-made religion and the other one began to worship god by a divine revelation and right from there starts to two seeds that's god that's going to be weaving all the way through the bible amen and so when you want to talk about the trail of the serpent that's where the trail of the serpent begins amen and it weaves all the way down to the book of revelation and what is it it's these two it's the twins amen it's always been twins amen two forms of religious worship one by the ideas of man one by the idea of god amen one by man's efforts and man's ability and man's wisdom one with no of none of man's ability none of man's wisdom but by a divine revelation of god and this is going to mark the righteous seed those who have an imputation of righteousness because they were able to believe god and being able to believe god and righteousness will be imputed unto them so the righteous line will be able to believe god not believe in god because cain believed in god nimrod believed in god nebuchadnezzar believed in god amen they all believed in god but there was a line that believed god and what he said they said amen and when they believed god they had faith and without faith it is impossible to please god so there was one line that would please god by faith and there was one line amen that would always be trying to swallow this line up and these two vines begin from the roots right there and they start to twist and they start twisting before the flood when the suns have gone saw the daughters of men and right there those vines started to overlap and god come down to cut it off amen he's going to cut it off and destroy it but out of the ark because brother benham said that seed came through the ark and man it came through the women like it did in eden and it came through the ark and it came out of the ark amen and when it came out of the ark it was closer than it was before because now the bible will say amen the sons of noah were ham sham and japheth amen and now we have the sons of noah ham shem and japheth and out of them comes everybody but somehow through that is coming this false vine and now it it's hard to detect it's harder than it was before so now those two vines are weaving tighter and tighter and tighter until the end time when a prophet would come and open this and god would open the seals through a prophet and he would start to unwind these two vines praise gone started all the way back and then winding themselves out to the end so the false religion started in cain come down through the sons of noah ham from ham to nimrod nimrob at the time of babel come down through king nebuchadnezzar time and all the way out to revelation as babylon so what started is just moving all the way down through it's progressing all the way down through but the righteous line is progressing all the way down through as well let's look at genesis 11 verse 1. and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and they came to pass as they journey from the east that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go-to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar and they said go too let us build us a city and the tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth amen now they've they've they've come out of the ark and they've been given a commission from god to go forth and multiply replenish and multiply abundantly upon the face of the earth amen and now as they're traveling east they come to the valley of shinar and they said now they were one language one speech and they said not let us make brick and burn them thoroughly they had brick for stone and slime they had for mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and the tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth when they began to speak like this it was an antichrist spirit because when they came out of the ark god said unto noah and to his sons and to their wives multiply and replenish the earth and tell them to go forth and multiply abundantly upon the face of the earth god was going to scatter them throughout the earth amen but now they come to shinar and they said no let's stop here let's make bricks and they took bricks and mourner said let's build us a city and a tower whose top will reach into god and make a name for ourselves not the name of the lord not a name for god but let us make a name for ourselves lest we should be scattered about the earth and right here they are anti-word because the word said go out and replenish the earth because the plan of god is always the manifested word for that day and those who would follow god's word would go out not ban themselves together not make for themselves a name but go out and separate and replenish the earth like god said but here comes that devil anointing amen upon a group of people and upon nimrod amen and that devil anointing will get him to defy the very commandment of god he said let us bend ourselves together and he says let us build a city and a tower a city is civil government civil society and a tower is religious remember this tower unto heaven and right here you have the first unification of the ecclesiastical and the civil horns and we find it again over in revelation chapter 13 the beast that's rising up out of the land with two horns like a lamb there's a buffalo brother behind tells us that that's america and they're going to unite the ecclesiastical and civil horns but it didn't originate in revelation because nothing originates in revelation it originates in genesis so that very program amen that's going to bring about amen an image to the beast and a reviving of the beast of the worship of the beast is going to be this same system that started right here friends where they take let's build us a city civil government let's build us a tower religious and they're going to unite civil and ecclesiastically everything started in genesis i mean let's just read this in revelation hold your place here in genesis i want to read it because we're going to take our time we're going to study the bible revelation 13 verse 11. and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth brother branham said land where there's no people this is america amen every other nation came up out of europe amen before that out of the population but here was unpopulated area out of the earth he had two horns like a lamb a lamb is young he says this nation is still young and he spake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first beast before him and caused the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he do with great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying unto them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by the sword and did live and he had power to give life into the image of the beast but the rest of the world counsel the churches that the image of the beast should both speak and cause the that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed so here we have the two horns united and the uniting of the two horns is the uniting of the civil and ecclesiastical powers and all the way back in genesis 11 you have a uniting of civil and ecclesiastical powers under whose administration nimrod's and what the tower of babylon now you see why this tower is so wicked it's so wicked for many reasons it's wicked because their whole plan to unify themselves was contrary to the word and the desire of god god didn't want them to unify themselves he didn't want him to build a name for themselves he wanted them to go out and replenish the earth and now they're defying the very commandments of god they're rebellious in nature rebellious to the word of god amen and they can never come into a relationship with god through this system this system will never bring them into a relationship with god because the system is defiant it's defying the very program of god in that day brother ben said in the message the oneness of unity he said and then in this great thing they had a man by the name of nimrod and nimrod was bringing all the rest of the cities and the nation under one great dominion showing that it's a man-made theory just a pattern but god's church is united under god man has nothing to do with it it's united under god and and this babylon which was the beginning in the creation in the genesis we find out that it's plumb over in revelation and it speaks of this ecclesiastical world in the last days which is now will finally unite under the antichrist a man-made religion 1959 super sign said it was nimrod one day who said that he'd built a tower that would bring his people he would show what he should he could achieve by his intelligence and he was to build a tower that would go beyond the clouds that if the wrath of god ever come he could outsmart him i want you to realize what nimrod was building was a religious system a religious order but it wasn't just a religious order it was a civil and religious order unified together amen it was a one world order amen it was a it was a government backing a religion a religion backing a government however you want to say it and he was going to uh uh that he would go beyond the clouds in this thing that if the wrath of god ever come he would outsmart him with his scientific research he could place the rocks and the stones in such a way that he could take the people to safety by his intelligence see this is the whole purpose of religion the whole purpose of religion is to make a protection for the people from the judgments of god because god wants to judge sin why does god want to judge sin because he wants to purge sin and he wants to bring us to an atonement to repentance to an atonement to restore fellowship but a religion is going to keep us from coming to the judgment of god and without coming to the judgment by the word we will never come to the atonement and we will never come back into fellowship and so religion is here to keep us from the judgment of god the religion is here to protect the people from god because you can sin all you want and go sit in a booth next to a priest and confess it to him and do some prayers on some beads and you are forgiven of your sin especially if you burn a candle and drop a few coins in now you're forgiven you don't need the word you don't need god you don't need the blood all you need is the church and the system of religion and the system of religion will free you from the judgment of god that's what nimrod set up amen nimrod said that system up this is the beginning amen through cain was the beginning of the catholic church now nimrod was perpetuating the catholic system you say it doesn't say catholic in the bible it's the same spirit amen it's the spirit that doesn't need a humble repentance to god it's a spirit that doesn't need god and a mercy of god begging god for and repent and say god forgive me for my sin wash me clean bring me through atonement restore me in fellowship you don't need any of that all you need is the system amen just come to church and pay your tithe and everything's fine with you you're a christian repeat after me shake my hand put your name on the book you're a christian that's nimrod system that's cain's system god's system is the word amen bringing us to an atonement now nimrod he wanted to a way that he could take the people to safety by his intelligence make a religious order by his own understanding his own intelligence that would be a place of safety for the people it was religious by nature it was religious in its overtones it had the appearance of being good but it was evil in this system it provides a false covering of false atonement a false unity a false protection from judgment see judgment was never a problem for the righteous seed if you think of noah in the day of judgment judgment was never a problem for the righteous seed because god always provided an atonement or a way through the judgment for the righteous seed so if you're the righteous seed of god you don't fear judgment because your father is using judgment to rid you from the influence of cain's line because there was a problem where the influence coming from cain was causing the daughters uh the sons of god to look on the daughters of men and begin to bring a hybridization a unifying of the two vines so god in his mercy would bring judgment his judgment was to free the people from the thing that was going to destroy them this is god's love when god brings a fiery word amen and he brings a judgment by that word he is not trying to destroy you he's trying to destroy the thing that's trying to destroy you but in the face of judgment he always by his word provides an ark amen a way to escape the judgment a way to pass through the judgment and be safe and be saved and be alive so for the righteous seed they don't fear the judgments of god amen because god always provides a way for his children so who fears the judgments of god those who are not the seed of god and because of their fear of the judgments of god they try to make their own way to protect themselves their own religion to protect them from the judgment of god that's what we see you know these statements i make they may seem a little bit harsh but if you really just let yourself look at the bible then look around at the world and the conditions it's in you realize cain's objective was to protect the people from another flood and the flood was the righteous judgment of a righteous god and he was trying to keep the people from judgment and he was trying to bring the unified the people make a name for themselves defying the very commandment of god and then define the commandment of god they all felt safe because they were working on a tower that would get them beyond the judgment of god so that they could go into the tower and sing with the angels and let the judgment pass and then they could come back down and live any way they want to live so that you could go out on friday night and be so drunk that you can't find your way home on saturday but as long as you go to a confession and take a mass amen and have a wafer stuck in your mouth then you're fine that system started in revel in genesis and continues on the day and it didn't stop at the catholics it moved to the baptist it moved to the methodist the wesley amen all the way down through to the pentecostals and it's the same religious spirit that is trying to get to the bride amen but there's a bridegroom here says not i'm going to unveil that thing so that that system won't get to my bride it's not the strength the wisdom the power of the bride the bride is just as helpless as anybody else in the bible has ever been helpless amen but it's the presence of the bridegroom that is here to say we are not going to have that system she is not going to fall she's predestinated not to fall amen and you know when god saw that he was going to predestinate that this bride was not going to fail by that same religious system at that same time he knew there would be a malachi 4 prophet come on because that bride is not strong enough in herself to resist that system those people are not wise enough and taught well enough and well enough versed in the bible to stop that system see when god looked down and he foresaw that he would have a bride at the end time without spot or wrinkle amen that there was going to be a perfect bride that was going to unite with a perfect bridegroom he didn't re he didn't make that declaration because he looked down and saw you and say you were fit for the job and you'll be able to do it he looked at you and you were just like every one of his poor children that was sown into corruption and stuck into hybridization and you would fail the same as everybody else would fail but he had a plan in this day because he was going to open the seals in this day so that he was going to expose the tactics of the devil and he was going to unwind the trail of the serpent and the two vine so you could see what's happened all the way back and avoid the very same thing today you know what the devils those devils amen that were anointing nimrod and all those people are alive today i mean those devils i mean that satan the titanic spirit that was moving in cain is moving today the satanic spirits that were moving the people to build the tower of babel are moving today and we know that in this day amen two hundred thousand thousand demons were unleashed out of the river euphrates and he said going for what going after the denomination no after the bride now there's special reserved demons that have been reserved for the end time that are now unleashed and they're targeting who the bride what kind of demons religious demons how are we going to stand all those same spirits that had always caused failure in the past that have always tripped up god's children in the past how are we going to resist all them and 200 000 000 that's been unleashed in the end time i'll tell you how christ himself would come he wouldn't leave it to anybody else he wouldn't leave it to another another dispensation another church age on the strength of the people but he would come down himself amen and when he come down himself it would be the unveiling of god and the unveiling of god would unveil the serpent seed amen and the serpent's tactics and the trail of the serpent amen and he himself would be here in this day and say look at this and look at that watch out for that and don't go over there it's the evidence that the bridegroom is here friends he's here protecting his little bride from those religious demons that are circling all around you you know what those spirits want to do they want you to be satisfied believing in malachi 4 that god sent a prophet dressing holy and going to church and paying tithes and settle down and make that your tower of protection against the judgment all of those demons want to take the message and make it a religion and they want you to accept the religion or the message but the message is not a religion the message is not doctrines the messages and the teaching the message is the bridegroom amen and he's here today to unite with the bride and he's dwelling in his bride protecting her from those demons it's the mind of christ it's the revealing of the word of god it's not you it's not me it's him praise be to god he's ensuring in this day she's not going to fall by those same spirits but don't you think those demons aren't all around you circling waiting for an opportunity but god is going to be sure this day this day he's going to have a bride without spartan vehicle how's he going to do it he's going to come down and dwell in her to ensure it and she's going to have the mind of christ she's going to have the word it's going to be fullness of his spirit back in the church again and he's going to take every obstacle that's out there and bring it right back to the word and say look here look here look here remember what the prophet said remember what i showed the opening seals here it is in genesis 11. here it is in genesis here here it is who's doing that not a preacher amen the bridegroom is doing that for his bride saying watch that tactic watch this tactic watch that trap he's here to make sure that she doesn't fail like the ones before because she's predestinated not to if you ever start getting the idea that i'm secure just because i'm bride and i go to a message church you're in super dangerous realm right there you're just about on the edge of collapse because anybody can take to themselves the title of bride and anybody can come along and be convinced to believe a certain set of things and cooperate with a group of people amen and then begin to believe that they're justified and secure in that and now these little compromises that i have in my life and these little anti-word things that are all around it's okay because i'm the bride that's those demons working that is what those demons are trying to produce where we can have men who are double married and have women who are divorced and remarried and have all kinds of things that are going on in the message but it's okay because i believe malachi 4 and i'm the bride and i'm in the message when the prophet who brought the message said that's wrong the prophet who would stand on the pulpit preaching flashing red light of his coming and talk about tight clothes and short dresses and makeup and high heels and excessive jewelry and it can walk right into a messy church and sit down every sunday say i'm filled with the holy ghost i'm bright of jesus christ what produces that the same demons that built this tower feeling secure and safe in a form of religion not in a relationship with the bridegroom because the relationship with the bridegroom takes the word it says look here look here look here look here and the elect says amen amen that's how you want me to dress amen that's how you want me to act amen this is how you want me to worship amen but when we throw those things off and do whatever we want because we're bride that's the influence of those demons [Music] and don't think they're not all around you brother better say where did those 200 thousand thousand demons go after the denomination know the bride so why are you under so much pressure but don't worry the bridegroom's here all is well my bridegroom is here he goes on and says in jehovah jireh 1961 the beginning of abraham he'd come down from babylon from shinar and dwelt in the valleys and we know all about babylon how that nimrod was the first one to try to make an organization he organized a great religious move and made all these little churches pay tribute to him to this big city of babylon built a tower there that went up into the heavens and so forth he thought with his own thoughts he thought that he could do something that would save the people praise god you see there's nothing that you can do to save yourself keeping a religious order will never save you i said before the message has an order to it because everything in god has an order to it god has an order to worship god has an order everything and god's system has an order to it so there's a certain order to worship amen but but when we when we look at the order and the keeping of the order of security then we're on dangerous grounds you cannot save yourself there's not one thing you've got to solemnly trust on the grace of god to do it you can't save yourself i don't care how religious you are how good you try to be and keep all the commandments and everything that won't do one thing it's the grace of god amen so now they've come in and in genesis chapter 11 they come to the said let us build a city and a tower let's bake bricks and they took bricks and had slime for mortar and they built them a city and the tower whose top may reach into heaven let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth they're absolutely defying god's word and the lord god came down to see the city and the tower which the children and men build in and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down there and confound their language they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth that was his intent from the beginning so god the very thing they were trying to protect themselves against is the very thing that came because you can't stop the word of god so god come and confounded their language so that they could not understand one another and he scattered them abroad upon the face of the earth which was his original intention when they came out of the ark but god had it anyway and what was this judgment this judgment was the protection of his seed because they were all binding themselves to this they were all coming into this order and nimrod listen nimrod was not just passively bringing them under this order he was through conquering conquest and war was bringing the world to this religious order he was a mighty man he was a mighty hunter before the lord he was a man of war he was a man of strength amen and brother bam talks about this in the church age book but he wasn't just saying you know anybody who wants you can come if you don't want to it's fine he was by conquering conquest he was forcing a religious unity so god because it wasn't time yet it wasn't time yet there'll be a time for that the time is at the door now for this religious unity of a one-world system uniting civil and ecclesiastical powers together and forcing a religious order that will bring all the world under its heading that day is here friends but it wasn't then and so god still had some work to do he still has some redeeming to do he still had some uh uh some manifesting of himself of his word to do he came down and he stopped it amen what was that that was god's mercy that was god's grace that was god working his plan and he come down and he stopped and he confused their languages and he scattered them abroad over the face of the earth and then god's children the elect of god would be scattered here and scattered there and god could speak to them individually which is what he wanted from the beginning not in the group god didn't want the group god was against the group from the beginning from the very beginning in genesis god was against systematic religion and he was against formal religion and he was against group mentality from day one he was against it so now he scatters them abroad and he says brother ben says in 1956 the junction of time says notice during that time there was a man by the name of nimrod who went out and built the big city of babylon and confederated all the rounding cities that they'd all confederate together and they'd be one big city and that would be babylon and how that god despised that federation of world order god despised it but god's going to allow it because he's finally going to bring them to the final judgment now let's go back to genesis chapter 9. i want to look at something we skipped over now i want to end with this thought out of genesis 9. now remember what brother ben told us and what we see in the tower they wanted to bend themselves together and make a name for themselves unless they be scattered so they wanted to unify themselves and they wanted the power that come from unity it can still be a false notion today even amongst ourselves that there's power and unity of individuals that's a false concept of the carnal mind your power is your unity with the word of god your power is unity with the life of god your power is unity with god one man totally surrendered to god can change the whole world is that what he said god doesn't need many he needs one one totally surrendered and in the hand of god it can change the whole world amen when paul and barnabas went into a city they said these be the men that turned the whole world upside down there was two of them god doesn't need the unification of forces amen and in a carnality we can bring this into religious realms and think the more people we can get together and the more agreement we have amongst ourselves and the more we say the same thing and believe the same thing and do the same thing the more power we have that does not equal power many times that brings the deception that is the playground for these religious spirits where they begin to sway groups and move groups amen because they can take one or two or three and bring them to the head of a vast number and move them what god wants is the power that comes from an individual united with christ amen where the two have become one that's power that's all the power that this bride needs and everyone individually connected to the head brings a unity but it's not a lateral cross unity it's a vertical unity with christ jesus an individual connected to christ and if you're an individual connected to christ then we are bond with an inseparable bond of fellowship but all of us bonding ourselves together in fellowship does not equal a connection to christ and no matter how many of us you get bound together and how much agreement that we have together if there's not a bind individually to christ amen it becomes a deception it becomes a trap amen and it has the negative effect on the believers not a positive effect this is the devil's tactics the seals are open the traditional veil has been rent christ is in plain view the antichrist has been exposed what's the devil howling about that is being revealed what's the devil what's he howling about that is the individual one man the word in her alone one person one individual not the group what's the devil howling about this is what the devil is howling about he wants religion god wants one god wants you the devil wants religion and when brother branham was coming and breaking up the denominations and busting up the religious idea he wasn't just breaking up denominations that i'm a denomination he's breaking up the mentality the spirit that created the denomination the spirit that was on nimrod the spirit that was on cain the spirit was on nebuchadnezzar the spirit that was on rome when brother ben became when god was ministering through that prophet he didn't come to bust the nominations and say well we broke up the baptist we broke up the mess he is breaking up that spirit amen that created the denominations to begin with and this is what the devil is howling about friends this is what he's so angry about this is what he wants to shut down and stop the power of true unity you as an individual united with christ that's the power of true unity and if christ before you who can be against you i am persuaded neither life nor death nor nor anything shall separate me from the love of god that's the power of unity the other is a knockoff it's a false unity that brings deception and weakens the bride i'm not saying don't come to church we have a commandment for that too but let the true unity prevail don't get stuck in the false be unified with christ now i want to i want to share this last thought and then we'll close for tonight genesis chapter 9 verse 8. and god spake unto noah unto his sons with him saying and i beheld and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cat of the fowl and of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the vote shall be seen in the cloud and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the water shall no more become a flood to destroy all the flesh and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth the powerful thing in this scripture is that nimrod convinced the people that they needed to ban themselves together and protect themselves against the judgment of god and build a tower that if god would bring floods upon the earth again they could go up into the tower and when the floods pass they could come back down and they were ignoring the very promise of god that said i will not ever destroy the earth with the flood again it's another anti-chr anti-christ move amen god himself promised he said i will never destroy the earth this is to you and to perpetual generations and to everything that has breath and every living thing in flesh upon the face of the earth i will never bring the floods of water destroy everything on the earth again and for a sign for a token i will put a rainbow in the sky and every time i bring a cloud the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud as a covenant as a token between the covenant of you and i and nimrod's actions proved that they did not believe god would keep his word this is what is so detrimental to religion amen a religious system that's trying to protect people has absolutely no faith in the word of god because god said that token is a covenant it's a sign of a covenant between me and you and i made a promise and he didn't base it off any of their conduct the promise lay totally in his word and the strength of his character and the strength of him being god who would keep his word and he said i will not destroy the earth with the flood again and nimrod comes and convinces the people to mistrust god this is a trust issue he convinced the people that you cannot trust the word of god you cannot trust grace alone you cannot trust the word of god we have to do something ourselves see the seeds of all religion god was good to his word and he has been good to his word ever since for thousands of years god has put the rainbow there as a token he's been faithful to display and proving that he's a man of he's not like a man that should lie he's a god that keeps his word and god has been faithful to that word but nimrod brings them together amen they bring them together in a mistrust of the word of god and that the word of god is not enough and we can't trust god's word alone we have to protect ourselves in case the word doesn't hold in case god is not faithful to his promise oh my goodness friends that's religion friends any time that the devil tries to get you through some religious action to protect yourself or to prove something or to guard yourself you don't need to protect yourself or guard yourself you're under the promises of god he's promised that nothing will happen to you that hasn't first crossed his desk there's nothing that will harm you there's nothing that will come against you we don't need anything but the but the trust that god will keep his word if he said it it's true it's forever true i don't need to do anything to protect myself he is my protection i don't need to become anxious for tomorrow i don't need to be well i don't need to become anxious for retirement i don't need to be worried about my family i don't need to become nervous and anxious and upset because god always said if you look at the lilies amen this was jesus christ god in flesh he said consider the lilies they neither toil or spin but solomon in all his glory was not erased such as one of these don't think what what you'll wear your raymond or tomorrow what we'll put on god knows that you have need of these things look at the sparrow listen the question is is he still faithful to his word was that the word of god and is it still true today or do we have to do something to protect ourselves and provide for ourselves old religious demons creeping in you've got to do something you've got to guard you've got to prove your faith oh praise god devils are dropping amen the veil is torn off friends the traditional veil has been ripped wide open amen god is here himself trying to keep us free from those things convince the whole world to put all their labor and resources in time to build a useless religion that tower was a useless religion it would do nothing because the rainbow was the evidence that this tower would never be needed and god has sent us a token in this day and the token is his own life in you and that's all the evidence that you need that everything is fine you don't need anything else you don't need to prove anything you don't need any other security all you need is that life living in you you need to be quickened by the baptism of holy ghost which is the token today his life in the individual is the sign is the token is the proof of the covenant you don't have to be tricked into doing something else or proving something else or manifesting something else the token the life of christ that he's given out to his bride today the union that he's come into with you as an individual the token life the baptism of the holy ghost is the token that his covenant with you is good and he won't fail to keep his word and if the if the devil can come along and try to trick us into putting our efforts and our time and our labor and our energy into some religious work that'll be some sort of protection or proof or vindication or evidence the token is the evidence the token is the sign the token is the only thing you need amen when they're building this tower friends you realize they're baking brick they're all working thousands of people maybe tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands i don't know how many people are laboring with bricks and mortar and building and it's going higher and they're all working together in unity and harmony and every time a rain cloud comes by there's an evidence that there that god won't fail his word and everything you're doing is wasted effort it's in vain and won't help you a bit and all it will do is keep you from faith in the token and in this day god sent a cloud again and in the cloud was a token the life of jesus christ there was a rainbow in the cloud and that cloud is in evidence that he keeps his covenants it's not you prophet of god says it's not what i did i wasn't the one who opened the blind i was the one who did those things i was just standing there when he did those things it's not a religious work or a religious order or keeping of a certain code of conduct or rules or order of a church amen it's a yielding to him and letting him do through you all the works that he's ordained for you to do none of those things are your token the sign of the covenant the token is his life in you and his life in you when you surrender to him becomes a token on display by you manifesting the word for your day it's not a work that you do it's a work that he comes in and does through you the whole effort of the tower of babel was evidence they did not trust god and they did not believe his word and the whole religious order of the day is evidence that they do not trust god and they do not believe his word it doesn't matter how many bible verses they quote it doesn't matter how many works that are done verses that are quoted and efforts that are made it's all in vain because the token is proof of the covenant and god will keep his word in the message god's provided way it says now man has tried to achieve through all along we think of nimrod when he thinks of one time that god destroyed the world with water this great prince of babylon he said i can get by that see he's trying to find something it's his nature man does them he proved his nature when adam taking his bite from the tree of knowledge separated himself from god he tried to make himself a way back to god by covering himself with fig leaves a religion making himself he was trying to make salvation without an atonement and we find that man's still doing the same thing today joining church putting his name on a book trying to find a way of uh saying a few prayers a certain way or repeating a couple of creeds trying to find salvation without atonement you cannot you've got to have an atonement for sin and sin is unbelief and there's no other sin but unbelief i've often said that drinking committing adultery and swearing is not sin that's the attributes of sin you're an unbeliever the reason you do it but if you did believe god you would not do that see you could not do it if you're a believer now we find then that man has separated himself from god and always trying to use that same tree of knowledge to get back by and take himself farther away all the time therefore we find nimrod immediately afterwards tried to build him a tower a religious tower that if god did destroy the world again what would he do he would climb up and take his people and go up above the flood of the tower and he'd get above it what did they come what become of it all of his achievement make himself a great name he perished with his tower brother braham said in oneness he said a false union brought judgment on the earth to even adam and eden in a false union brought the floods of god's judgment on the earth because the daughters of cain flirted with the sons of god and they fell for it and united together again there you are a false union nothing could happen what did god do he destroyed the whole thing all but precious old noah in his family and again after that after the death of noah that spiritual family and know the first thing you know the children of man began to look to one another again what did they do they said now we're not infidels we all believe in god so they got a fellow by a leader some some great archbishop by the name of nimrod and they built a tower they wasn't infidels they believed there was a heaven they believed there was a hell they believed in judgments but the children of god were the daughters of men again and they made themselves a union falsely and built a great big cathedral a great big organization and the all the other places babel was to pay tribute to it he's building the same thing now and he'll bring it by a false union watch the unions don't be united with anything but christ and he is the word and god hiding himself in simplicity sin and that's what we ought to do today friend we got to take the whole word of god because we're going to need it we got to use every word that's in there it's thus saith the lord and we've got to use the full gospel all of it now when god had fortified his church he fortified it with the best thing that he could find because it's his own children and he fortified the church by the word his own word just asked him to believe his word that's all there was and satan by his wisdom caused eve to break down that barrier just in one place satan admitted every bit of the word was right but said surely that's all he had to know surely you won't die now that was the loophole he got eve from behind that word with one little doubt that's exactly where he gets to church today the same thing just that one little doubt brings you on this side and now there's no way to ever try to think that god will ever spare you through belonging to a church belonging to an organization or a group or whatever it is or any sensation you've got to believe his word and act upon the same right that's the only way that's god's program at the beginning that's god's program down through life that's god's program now is the church must stay behind the word that's the only way that you can be safe but religion will come along through these devils and begin to get us to act in a way that proves we don't have trust in god see that's what caused eastfall in the beginning amen when he came when the sermon came to eve he says can you eat of all the trees and she said we can eat all the trees but the one in the midst of the garden and he says you'll not surely die for god doth know that the day you eat thereof your eyes shall be opened you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and all the sudden eve started to question whether god was holding out on her or not it was an issue of trust trusting god to be righteous trusting his way to be correct trusting his even if he withheld a revelation trusting that he was god and he was the father and he was withholding a revelation for good today the devil can try to push us into revelations and push us in to overreaching and going beyond the prophet of god and trying to get to a place that god has not opened up yet and it's an issue of trust [Music] we have to trust god amen and trust his word and trust him but the serpent will come along and do the same thing he did to eve and begin to question trust and do the same thing he did to those under nimrod's rule they began to question whether they could trust god to keep his word and eve was made to to to lack trust in god's way in god's timing in in god's word and i say today the devil will come along and try to attack us and trust and brother branham said we're fortified behind the word and this bride stays behind the word and trust him to keep his word we trust him to do what he said he would do trust him to keep his word and to provide everything that we have need of because he said he would we don't have to protect ourselves we don't have to figure anything out we don't have to push a head too far we just trusted him i want to read just a couple more quotes he said and satan's eden satan wanted and he took it over and he had six thousand years to build up his eden as god had six thousand years to bring his eating to close and by deceit the seed of the word or the people now establishes his own eden in this earth in sin god's eden was established in righteousness satan's eden is established in sin because satan is sin god is righteousness and god's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and satan's establishment is in sin and religious sin so satan established his eden not on drunks and harlots and prostitutes catch this satan has established his eden on religious sin religious unbelief it sounds like an oxymoron but it's the absolute purpose of religion the purpose of the religion is to gather unbelievers that's what nimrod did nobody would waste one drop of sweat to put one brick down who believed that god would never send a flood again the religion of the day was to gather unbelievers and religion today is to gather unbelievers because those who believe the word of god don't need religion don't need a structure don't need a form don't need to perform something do something show something to have security their security is in the token because the token shows the covenant is still in effect amen that's why all the way back in egypt all they needed to do was what that prophet told him to do and slay that lamb and take that blood and put it on the lentil and on the door and that was the token that they were in a covenant with god and the death angel would pass amen they didn't have an experience it had never happened before they couldn't prove it they couldn't guarantee it they couldn't show the last time they couldn't they couldn't demonstrate it year after year amen this was the first time they were faced with this situation but god had sent a prophet on the scene to give him his word and a token that would show that he's in covenant with them and he will not let the death angel enter that home that had followed the word and now the token on the door was evidence that the people in the house believed that prophet and in believing that prophet they believed god god has given us his token this day and this token is his life a revelation of jesus christ personally to you a relationship it's just you and him and you can't prove nothing guarantee anything demonstrate show a certificate but you're asked to have confidence in that token and that token is the life of the word and the token on display is the life of the word through you and all you're asked to do is receive it and believe it and then let him manifest and satan's even again he said the god of this world today the worshiped person of this world today is satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping satan but it's satan impersonating himself as the church see as the church they worship satan thinking they are worshiping god through the church but it's the way satan has done it oh you say but wait a minute we preached the word look back here at my text tonight satan was the one that preached the word to eve first god hath said see it's that misc oh dial in for this last little this last little punch of the devil and then we'll go it's that misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day that's the error that's the problem you can preach all the past word you can preach all about jesus at calvary you can preach all about walking on water and miracles and disciples and church ages and paul amen but it's misconstruing that word that's for the day that's the deception that's the trap they preached the word like he preached the word satan came as the serpent came and had the word but he was misconstruing that commandment that was for the day amen that's why we're not we're not even we're not even bothered amen by all the other denominations and things that are out there but it's that demon spirit that will get in and try to come close to where the bride is and misconstrue that word for today pointing to the past looking back preaching something else but misconstruing the word for today he'll let you know all that jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that moses did was perfectly well but when you take the promises that they gave for this day then that was applied to another age so they'll take the word for today and they'll either put it back or put it forward and if you put it back or put it forward that's the deception that's the devil right there what will they do quote the word use the scriptures but take the word for today and either put it back there or forward there when you take that promise that they gave for this day then that was applied to another age that's just all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way and that's all for you cannot take one word away from it or add one word to it but that's what he does brother bev says in the token god once gave a token to the people and that was a rainbow looky listen close we're closing god ever remained true to that token way back in the days of noah the destruction that entered the luvian world god gave this nation or give the world a rainbow sign for a token and god ever displays his token as the thousands of years rolled by he never fails because he watches his tokens all these thousands of years he has displayed it to us showing us that he never fails to honor the token he never fails to honor it he expects us now to display the token over our faith to satan's group and the unbelievers and the cults and so forth that don't believe in him that we believe what he has said of his promises and that jesus christ is raised up from the dead showing himself alive and that is the badge the token of identification because it's christ's own life in you identifying the word it doesn't need anything else let's stand praise god i hope you're enjoying this as much as i am brother branham said the devil's tactics have been exposed and he doesn't like it but the bridegroom is here to make sure that we don't fall back into these old traps we don't need religious we don't need a religious order all we need is him and he is coming this day to unite individually with each one of his elect bride and that is their security that is their token that is the word for this day and god has brought a security to his bride and he's brought an open word to her and he's here himself unveiling the word so that he would ensure that this day he will have a bride that won't fail now i want you to think back every bride that failed before how did they fail they failed by religion but he's going to have a bride this day that won't fail not because she's smarter but because he's here have confidence in that believe him don't get sucked into a religious order some sort of performance or pressure just connect with him and let his life and you be the token your security your past your fair is paid i'm not going into the judgment i've already bypassed the judgment i'm not here to protect myself defend myself work anything out it's already been worked out at calvary and i've got the token that the covenant is still in effect for me i can't prove it for you or anybody else and i can't put it on anybody else but the token is the there's an evidence that the covenant is in effect for me and today it's an individual token it's an individual walk it's an individual work don't get sucked back in to a group no more towers they were useless and they've been useless every one of them has been worthless salvation has come through none of them salvation has always come by the word for your day the elect seed has always found their way to the atonement through the revealed word for their day never through the system i thank god that he's brought a word for this day and he's given us a heart to believe he gave it to us that's his gift that's his seed on the inside that has the capacity to say that's nothing but the truth and i receive it and i yield to it and i give my whole life to that praise be to god let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for your word god we thank you that you're here you're here you're here you're here you're here to prevent us from falling in the same traps that your children have fallen in you're here to expose the devil's hiding place you're here to expose his tactics you're here to protect your little bride oh god we just want to say we have confidence in you that the token is all that we need lord it's you you've made it available in this day your own life you've come down the sign the token in the sky was evidence that the headship has come to unite with the bride you're here the mind of christ is here the full word is here the life of that word is here the bridegroom is here oh god you're our security you're our peace you're our safety you're our rest you are everything to us you have so done a work in this day so that we can relax lord and relaxing in you is the key to operating a gift just to rest and just to relax and knowing that all is well that the covenant is secure the token is the evidence that the covenant's in effect and god i just want to raise my hand and say i believe you and i know you'll keep your word i have no doubt i don't have to do it you've already done it i don't have to find a way you've already provided the way and revealed it to me the only thing you've asked your children to do in this day lord is to surrender all and to yield so you can have preeminence help us god we can't even yield unless you give us a spirit to yield unless you break away the fleshly spirit and give us your spirit we can't even yield properly give us the gift of faith lord your faith your spirit to anoint us to yield in a greater way may you accomplish all that you've intended to accomplish in this day may your word be manifest through each of us god bless us help us to stay true to your word help us to stay behind that word help us to trust you lord we ask for your blessings as we go from here continue to keep us lord guide us open our eyes lord that we might see more and more we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen god bless you all [Music] shalom and all is [Music] for all [Music]
