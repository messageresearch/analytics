[0:00] we have the same ministry
[0:03] this is a continuation of the ministry
[0:05] of jesus christ
[0:08] and he came and he gave a ministry a
[0:11] message
[0:12] for life
[0:14] not for condemnation
[0:16] for life
[0:17] brother branham's message was the same
[0:19] because it's the message of christ it's
[0:20] a message for life it's a message of
[0:22] life
[0:26] our message should be the same
[0:29] and we should live for others because
[0:31] that's what he did our life should be
[0:34] for others and say how is your life for
[0:36] others you know go to the soup kitchen
[0:37] and and do all that well we should we
[0:39] should do whatever we can brother bam
[0:40] said if i can do anything to make
[0:42] somebody's life a little bit better i
[0:44] want to do it
[0:45] so if we have opportunity to do good do
[0:47] it that's what the bible said if you
[0:48] have the opportunity to do good do it
[0:50] and do not be weary and well-doing
[0:52] so if you have opportunity do good do
[0:54] good
[0:55] but how can i live for others amen
[0:58] because i can recognize amen that my
[1:01] very existence on this earth is going to
[1:03] prevent a curse from coming upon this
[1:05] earth and as long as i'm here as far as
[1:08] i know there's an opportunity for
[1:10] somebody amen to come to life amen and i
[1:13] want i want to live my life for that
[1:15] reason i want to live my life for that
[1:17] purpose
[1:19] for others so that i have a broader
[1:21] vision of my life not a narrow vision of
[1:23] my life so that i don't get grumpy and
[1:25] cantankerous and down-hardened and
[1:27] become a hermit in my house and hate
[1:29] life and hate the government and
[1:34] stockpile guns and get a bunch of food
[1:36] and hide out in the basement and hate
[1:38] everybody because it's all corrupt and
[1:39] fallen apart amen what have i done i've
[1:42] removed myself
[1:45] from any opportunity that my existence
[1:47] will have on somebody else's eternal
[1:49] destination
[1:52] jesus says i don't pray to take you out
[1:54] of this world but i pray to keep you in
[1:56] the world
[1:58] to keep you while you're in the world
[2:00] amen because you have to be in the world
[2:02] amen but not of the world
[2:06] because your your very existence on this
[2:09] planet is opening a door
[2:13] creating an opportunity because it's a
[2:15] ministry of life
