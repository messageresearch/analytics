[4:32] bibles in turn to ephesians chapter 3.
[4:36] i just want to appreciate the lord and

[4:52] amen
[4:55] you can't be a day over 50.
[4:59] amen we'll turn to ephesians chapter 3
[5:02] and we'll beginning reading here
[5:04] and i just want to um let you know you
[5:06] heard the prayer request for brother joe
[5:08] faison i had a
[5:09] opportunity yesterday to call and talk
[5:10] to sister kathy
[5:12] and unless god works a miracle they
[5:15] don't expect brother joe to come out of
[5:16] this
[5:17] brother joe's lived a long life and
[5:19] angie and i had a
[5:20] privilege just a couple weeks ago maybe
[5:22] two or three weeks ago to go visit them
[5:24] and it was a really wonderful visit
[5:26] brother joe was feeling good and we got
[5:28] to visit with him
[5:29] but he told us then he goes i'm ready to
[5:31] go
[5:32] and so if the lord desires to take him
[5:34] home then we don't want to hold him here
[5:36] but if it's not his time and this is
[5:38] just the enemy then the enemy can't
[5:40] prevail
[5:41] so we just want to remember sister kathy
[5:43] at this time that the lord gives her
[5:44] strength
[5:45] and that god has his way but he brings a
[5:47] lot of peace and comfort
[5:49] and if it's time for deliverance he
[5:50] brings the deliverance
[5:52] either physically in his body or
[5:54] deliverance to escape his body
[5:57] either way for our brother that he might
[5:59] be free
[6:00] amen let's just uh bow our heads and ask
[6:03] the lord's blessing over sister kathy in
[6:05] the reading of the word and then we'll
[6:06] read our scripture
[6:08] dear lord jesus we thank you god for the
[6:10] privilege of gathering together again
[6:13] and lord may we never take this for
[6:14] granted
[6:16] well it's such a privilege lord not just
[6:18] to be able to come
[6:20] lord into this place that's consecrated
[6:22] and
[6:23] dedicated to you lord but also to be
[6:26] here together with one another
[6:28] that we might put our licks of fire
[6:29] together and we might
[6:31] lord worship together in unity and
[6:33] harmony and love
[6:35] god this is a privilege lord and may we
[6:37] never take it for granted
[6:38] but it mean may it mean something to us
[6:40] every time we can gather
[6:42] and lord as we look to you we are asking
[6:44] you to feed us as your sheep
[6:46] lord as we're gathering here lord we
[6:48] know that sister kathy is there with
[6:50] brother joe
[6:51] and lord as far as the doctors can see
[6:54] lord there's no
[6:55] there's no way there's no hope but lord
[6:57] you're our hope lord
[6:58] you're more than able to raise him up if
[7:00] that be your plan
[7:02] but god if you're calling our brother
[7:03] joe home may go home in peace with no
[7:05] struggle with no pain
[7:07] god either way may you deliver him from
[7:09] the condition he's in now
[7:11] by raising him up or taking him home and
[7:14] god would you be with our sister kathy
[7:15] and their children
[7:17] strengthen them lord comfort them be a
[7:19] very present help in a time of trouble
[7:22] may cathy find herself lord enveloped in
[7:24] your love
[7:25] may she find herself undergird by your
[7:28] strength
[7:28] and may she know that something
[7:30] supernatural is taking place all around
[7:32] her
[7:33] and god today as we look to your word as
[7:35] your children
[7:36] we're here to feed from your hand lord
[7:38] as you're the great shepherd
[7:39] we pray god that you would break the
[7:41] bread and that you would give us lord of
[7:43] your own hand
[7:44] the portion that we have need of in this
[7:46] day and may the lord you open our eyes
[7:48] and may we see you more clearly than
[7:50] ever before
[7:51] may you rub the eye salve fresh in our
[7:53] eyes and may our eyes be opened
[7:55] may our hearts be opened lord may we see
[7:57] you as you are
[7:59] may you draw us up higher from the
[8:01] carnal things of this life
[8:02] into the spiritual realities that are
[8:04] all around us
[8:05] well we love you we give you preeminence
[8:08] and that's that you take your place
[8:09] in the service in jesus christ's name we
[8:11] pray
[8:12] amen you can all have your seats
[8:16] i mean let's look at ephesians chapter
[8:18] three and
[8:19] i'll give you my title but i'm not going
[8:22] to go directly into it there's a there's
[8:24] some things i want to say as i move
[8:25] forward
[8:26] but for a title i'd like to talk about
[8:29] beholding the mystery
[8:30] and becoming the mystery revealed
[8:33] beholding the mystery
[8:34] and becoming the mystery revealed and i
[8:37] would like to start reading here in
[8:38] ephesians chapter 3 verse
[8:40] 2. i'm just going to take my time this
[8:42] morning and lay down this foundation
[8:43] these principles
[8:45] but as we read in verse 2 it says if you
[8:46] have
[8:48] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[8:50] the grace of god which has given
[8:52] me to you word how that by revelation he
[8:55] made known unto me the mystery
[8:57] as i wrote a four in a few words whereby
[9:00] when you read
[9:01] you may understand my knowledge in the
[9:03] mystery of christ
[9:04] which in other ages was not made known
[9:07] unto the sons of men as it is now
[9:08] revealed
[9:09] unto us holy unto his holy apostles and
[9:12] prophets
[9:13] by the spirit so paul was saying that
[9:16] a dispensation has been given to him
[9:19] a dispensation of the grace of god to
[9:22] give out
[9:22] to us to give to you word amen and how
[9:25] this is the mystery of god which that
[9:27] mystery is known in christ
[9:29] and it wasn't known in previous ages as
[9:31] it was now made known
[9:32] unto the holy apostles and prophets and
[9:35] i say we live
[9:36] in a day like the apostle paul is
[9:38] talking about
[9:39] we live in a day where the mystery of
[9:40] god has been dispensed amen
[9:43] through a dispenser like paul was a
[9:44] dispenser of the mystery
[9:46] but there's been a prophet in our day
[9:48] brother branham who is a dispenser
[9:50] of the mystery amen and he's looking
[9:52] back and he
[9:53] he's been given the revelation the amen
[9:55] of the seals the revelation of the
[9:57] mystery of god
[9:58] and and he's been able to look back and
[10:00] be a dispenser of that mystery
[10:01] but the dispensation was given to him to
[10:04] us word
[10:05] it wasn't just given to him for him amen
[10:08] the dispensation
[10:09] of the grace of god and of the truth was
[10:11] not given to paul for paul
[10:13] it was given to paul for us word and the
[10:16] dispensation of the mystery of grace
[10:19] amen in the mystery of christ was
[10:21] not given to brother venom for brother
[10:22] branham it was given to brother brennan
[10:24] for us
[10:25] and so now we know what the dispensation
[10:27] of this mystery is here for it's for us
[10:30] and there was a purpose it was given to
[10:32] us and that's what i want to speak on a
[10:34] little bit we've talked about it many
[10:35] times in many different ways
[10:37] but i'd like to speak on it again
[10:38] because it's not in vain
[10:40] that this mystery is revealed that when
[10:42] paul was given this dispensation of
[10:44] grace and he was given
[10:45] the mystery that was in christ that was
[10:48] contained all through the old testament
[10:49] but had been missed it had been missed
[10:51] had been missed
[10:52] and then christ had come and man it made
[10:53] been made manifest
[10:55] and it was god in flesh and he was here
[10:57] to pay the price of redemption so his
[10:59] elect could go
[11:00] free and when paul would pick up that
[11:02] dispensation
[11:03] and he would go back down through the
[11:05] scriptures and show how this is exactly
[11:07] what god was talking about this is
[11:09] exactly what the prophets were speaking
[11:10] of
[11:11] amen he was what paul was not doing is
[11:14] paul was
[11:15] not amen he was not building
[11:17] intellectualism or teaching
[11:19] knowledge so that there would be a
[11:20] gaining of knowledge
[11:23] because the gaining of knowledge was not
[11:25] going to do anything amen but the
[11:27] revelation of the mystery was going to
[11:29] change
[11:29] people's lives and so the the mystery in
[11:33] our day that's been given out to us
[11:35] was not for an accumulation of knowledge
[11:39] for knowledge sake
[11:40] it wasn't to say that i know what
[11:42] happened in the garden of eden now i
[11:44] know
[11:44] about the godhead and i know better than
[11:46] another church knows and i know better
[11:49] than rest of christian who knows that
[11:50] wasn't the purpose of the dispensation
[11:52] of the mystery in this day
[11:54] but the mystery came to us to change our
[11:57] lives
[11:59] just like it did in paul's day paul
[12:01] brought the mystery amen
[12:03] and when the mystery when the mystery
[12:05] when the dispensation the mystery was
[12:06] given out
[12:07] amen in that mystery truth now hit the
[12:10] elect seed
[12:11] amen who had been gentiles who had been
[12:13] given over to heathenism
[12:15] who had been in all manner of sin when
[12:18] that mystery was given to them
[12:20] amen there was something in them that
[12:22] could recognize that as truth
[12:24] amen and when they when that when that
[12:26] when those two pieces came together
[12:28] the dispensation of the mystery the
[12:30] truth that had been hid in previous ages
[12:32] but was now made manifest
[12:34] when that came no if they were stuck in
[12:37] idolatry if they were stuck in false
[12:38] worship
[12:39] whatever they were in amen when that
[12:41] revelation
[12:42] came to them of the mystery of christ
[12:45] and what's the dispensation they're in
[12:47] and the privilege that they have now and
[12:49] the opportunity that's come to them
[12:51] quickly amen something sprung to life
[12:53] they came to it and it changed their
[12:55] entire life
[12:58] it didn't make them a scholar it made
[12:59] them sons
[13:03] man they didn't know they were sons they
[13:04] thought it was for jews now they found
[13:06] out that it was for gentiles that this
[13:08] dispensation now
[13:09] the mystery was that it was for the
[13:11] gentiles also and that he was going to
[13:12] call a people
[13:13] out of the gentiles for his namesake and
[13:16] we found out later that they called a
[13:17] people out of the gentiles for his
[13:19] namesake
[13:20] to be his bride amen but they didn't
[13:22] realize that in that day they thought it
[13:24] was only to the jews and now
[13:25] the dispensation of grace was coming to
[13:27] the gentiles so that he could call a
[13:29] people out for his namesake
[13:31] and when that truth came they didn't sit
[13:33] back and say
[13:34] now i see it it's so plain when they saw
[13:37] it it was
[13:37] more than just i i understand something
[13:40] i've got another bit of knowledge
[13:42] amen i have another a bit of trivia
[13:45] where i can pass a test or impress
[13:46] somebody with my knowledge
[13:48] but the revelation actually changed who
[13:50] they were
[13:52] it actually changed their conduct their
[13:54] attitude it actually quickened them to
[13:56] life amen the spirit came in and began
[13:58] to indwell them
[13:59] and changed everything about them
[14:03] that was the purpose of the mystery
[14:06] let's turn to second corinthians i
[14:09] really don't want to get ahead of myself
[14:10] i really want to
[14:12] lay this foundation second corinthians
[14:14] chapter 3.
[14:18] and i want to spend quite a bit of time
[14:21] in second corinthians chapter three
[14:23] and i'll begin at verse two by the time
[14:26] we're done we
[14:27] may have gotten the whole rest of the
[14:28] chapter
[14:30] second corinthians chapter three verse
[14:32] two
[14:34] apostle paul says ye are our epistles
[14:36] written in our hearts
[14:37] known and read of all men for as much as
[14:40] you are manifestly declared to be
[14:43] the epistle of christ ministered by us
[14:46] written not with ink but with the spirit
[14:49] of the living god
[14:50] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[14:53] tables of the heart
[14:54] i want to pause here and pay attention
[14:56] to this because when the
[14:58] when the dispensation of grace and the
[15:00] and the dispensation of the mystery came
[15:02] to the apostle paul
[15:04] he did not go back like moses and go
[15:07] right another table of stones
[15:11] amen that was a dispensation in that day
[15:14] and that dispensation had a purpose amen
[15:16] but now he's in another dispensation and
[15:18] he's given he's giving out the word of
[15:20] god just like moses was giving out the
[15:22] word of god
[15:23] but in the previous dispensation it was
[15:25] written on tables of stone
[15:26] amen but in this dispensation it's not
[15:29] to be written on tables of stone
[15:31] this mystery this word that is coming
[15:33] forth from god
[15:34] through his prophet in paul's day is not
[15:36] going to be
[15:37] administered amen and distributed the
[15:40] same way that it was
[15:41] in moses's day because in moses's day he
[15:44] was given two tables of stone
[15:47] but in paul's day and then moses also
[15:50] was
[15:50] told to write a book of ordinances and
[15:52] moses got the commandments of god and he
[15:54] wrote a book of ordinances ordinances so
[15:56] he had two tables of stone with the ten
[15:57] commandments
[15:58] and he had a book of ordinances and the
[16:00] apostle paul came along
[16:02] and he says now amen he says now
[16:05] you are the epistles
[16:09] now it's not tables of stone but written
[16:12] in the fleshly tables of the heart
[16:13] amen now it is not to bring forth
[16:16] a new testament as far as another table
[16:20] and another book of ordinances
[16:22] but now it's time to bring forth the
[16:24] living word
[16:25] living in you paul's showing this is a
[16:29] change
[16:30] over the previous dispensation so let's
[16:32] read that again
[16:35] ye are our epistles written in our heart
[16:36] known and read of all men what he's
[16:38] referring to here
[16:39] is now he's saying that that that well
[16:41] let's pick it up in verse one just so
[16:43] you can see
[16:44] do we begin again to commend ourselves
[16:46] somebody was questioning paul and paul's
[16:48] authority and paul's credentials
[16:50] or need we as some others epistles of
[16:52] commendation to you
[16:54] are letters of commendation from you
[16:58] paul's now paul's authority is being
[17:00] questioned
[17:01] somehow some way and paul is saying do
[17:04] we need a letter of accommodation to you
[17:06] or do we need a a letter of
[17:08] accommodation from you
[17:10] ye are our epistles written in our
[17:13] hearts
[17:14] you are our letter of commendation your
[17:17] life
[17:18] in the gospel is that was paul's
[17:20] credentials paul was looking at you and
[17:22] saying
[17:22] you've been transformed you were a
[17:24] heathen you were packing idols i mean
[17:26] you were worshiping devils amen but now
[17:28] you are the evidence you are the epistle
[17:31] amen you
[17:32] are our commendation because it's not
[17:35] it's it's not about a new doctrine it's
[17:38] not about
[17:39] a new church order it's not about the
[17:41] pharisees for the pharisees and the
[17:42] sadducees for the sadduce
[17:44] it's all different now paul is saying i
[17:46] am i'm not looking for a letter of
[17:48] commendation i'm not working for anybody
[17:50] i'm working for god
[17:51] amen you are our epistles written in our
[17:54] hearts
[17:55] you're the evidence that he was a
[17:58] an apostle er epistles written in our
[18:02] hearts known and read of all men
[18:04] and then he goes on to say for as much
[18:05] as you are you are manifestly declared
[18:09] to be the epistle of christ or the
[18:12] letter of christ
[18:14] ministered by us written not with ink
[18:17] but with the spirit of the living god
[18:20] not in tables of stone but in the
[18:23] fleshly tables
[18:24] of the heart and such trust have we
[18:28] through christ to godward not that we
[18:30] are sufficient in ourselves to think
[18:32] anything
[18:33] as of ourselves but our sufficiency is
[18:36] of god
[18:38] i want to see here i want to read down a
[18:40] few more verses who also have made us
[18:42] able ministers of the new testament not
[18:45] of the letter
[18:46] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[18:48] but the spirit giveth life
[18:50] now he's saying the same thing who is
[18:51] also made as able ministers
[18:53] of the new testament not of the letter
[18:56] we are not
[18:57] going back to a book of ordinances this
[18:59] is not going back
[19:01] the old testament we had i mean the law
[19:03] we had a book of ordinances we had
[19:04] tables of stone
[19:05] we had all of that and now i'm not
[19:08] coming in this new testament
[19:10] to give you another book of ordinances
[19:15] not the letter this new testament is not
[19:17] for the letter
[19:18] this new testament is the spirit amen
[19:21] it's actually the life of the word it's
[19:23] not just the written word but now it's
[19:25] the life of the word that's being
[19:27] ministered
[19:28] it's a change in dispensation it's a
[19:31] total change it's a total new way of
[19:33] thinking
[19:34] amen for those who are raised as jews
[19:36] amen because
[19:37] you know god when he brought them out to
[19:39] sinai he delivered them from egypt with
[19:41] a mighty hand
[19:42] he actually brought them to sinai to be
[19:45] engaged to them
[19:46] amen and to be married and they accepted
[19:48] the terms of the engagement
[19:49] and now god was going to take them as a
[19:52] bride
[19:53] but when he come down to speak to them
[19:54] on the mountain they ran away from him
[19:58] they ran they were supposed to come up
[20:00] into the mountain but they ran far from
[20:01] the mountain
[20:02] and they told moses amen don't don't let
[20:04] god speak to us anymore unless we die
[20:07] but you go to him amen now they're
[20:09] calling for somebody to go between
[20:12] and that's not what god wanted god
[20:14] wanted a personal relationship but
[20:16] but it had to be this way amen and so
[20:19] now they said you go and whatever he
[20:21] tells you will do it
[20:23] and brother branham said this is where
[20:24] they made their fatal mistake amen
[20:26] they wanted a law they wanted something
[20:28] they could do
[20:30] when god had him under a grace covenant
[20:33] because abraham was under a grace
[20:34] covenant not a law covenant
[20:37] adam was under a law covenant if you do
[20:40] i will amen if you do this then this
[20:42] will happen
[20:42] but when it come to abraham amen so that
[20:45] god could secure it
[20:46] he could not make it based off merit
[20:49] because now by the fall
[20:50] no man had the merit to live all the law
[20:55] so he couldn't make it by law he knew it
[20:57] failed so he made it by grace
[20:59] knowing that his grace can't fail and so
[21:02] they were under a grace covenant
[21:04] amen and under a grace covenant they
[21:06] would god sent him a prophet
[21:07] god delivered them out of egypt god fed
[21:10] him on the way
[21:11] amen god parted the red sea all by grace
[21:13] by grace by grace by grace and by grace
[21:16] he was going to come and speak to him
[21:18] with his voice
[21:18] he was going to show his power and his
[21:20] glory amen but they could not endure
[21:23] that which was commanded they could not
[21:24] come to him
[21:25] amen so they ran afar off and they
[21:28] refused
[21:29] the commandment and they told moses you
[21:32] go get the instructions
[21:35] and you come back with the instructions
[21:37] and we'll keep the instructions
[21:41] and god god complied to their request
[21:44] because it it fit his desire to reveal
[21:47] himself
[21:48] amen and so now he come down first the
[21:51] ten commandments were spoken on the
[21:53] mountaintop they were not written in
[21:54] stone
[21:55] they were spoken and this was god was
[21:57] going to give them the commandments and
[21:59] add nothing else to it this is all he
[22:01] wanted to come into a covenant with his
[22:02] people
[22:04] but they ran away and they wanted moses
[22:07] to go get
[22:08] the the commandments and go get the
[22:10] instructions and then they would do all
[22:12] the instructions
[22:14] so when he goes up now now what was the
[22:16] god spoken word spoken directly to his
[22:18] people
[22:19] now was engraved in stone
[22:24] become firm become hard
[22:27] become unflexible and now they moved
[22:30] from a dispensation of grace
[22:32] to a dispensation of law
[22:36] and now god gave him the request he was
[22:38] going to now give them instructions
[22:39] through a prophet
[22:40] and that prophet will give the
[22:41] instructions and they said that they
[22:43] would keep all the instructions
[22:45] but the problem was they were never able
[22:47] to keep all the instructions
[22:50] they moved from grace to law for
[22:52] something that they could do
[22:54] only they couldn't do it now the apostle
[22:58] paul is coming and he's administering
[23:00] the new testament but not the letter
[23:04] because it was the letter that killeth
[23:07] amen because the latter
[23:09] amen paul says i i had not known
[23:12] sin but by the law amen because the law
[23:15] made sin exceedingly more sinful because
[23:17] once god
[23:18] said this is wrong and you find inside
[23:20] of you amen
[23:22] the inability to keep from doing that
[23:25] amen all of a sudden what was sin in you
[23:27] becomes exceedingly sinful
[23:29] and you don't even know it is sin amen
[23:31] until the law
[23:32] recognizes it as sin and then you cannot
[23:35] escape from
[23:36] it so the letter
[23:39] killeth the law became condemnation
[23:45] because they moved from grace to law so
[23:47] now in the new testament
[23:49] the apostle paul is not bringing them
[23:51] another letter
[23:53] but in the new testament it's a
[23:55] dispensational change
[23:56] but now he doesn't minister the new
[23:58] testament in the letter
[24:00] he ministers the new testament in the
[24:02] spirit
[24:04] because this is the only way to overcome
[24:09] i'll read verse six again who also has
[24:10] made us able ministers of the new
[24:12] testament
[24:13] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[24:16] the letter killeth
[24:17] but the spirit giveth life but if the
[24:19] ministration of
[24:20] death written and engraved in stones was
[24:22] glorious
[24:24] so that the children of israel could not
[24:26] steadfastly behold the face of moses
[24:28] for the glory of his countenance which
[24:30] glory was to be done
[24:32] away how shall not the ministration of
[24:35] the spirit
[24:36] be rather glorious for if the
[24:39] ministration of the condemnation be
[24:41] glory
[24:42] much more did the ministration of
[24:44] righteousness exceed exceeding glory
[24:46] for even that which was made glorious
[24:48] had no glory in this respect
[24:50] by reason of the glory that excelleth
[24:54] for if that which is done away was
[24:56] glorious much more that which remaineth
[24:59] is glorious so now
[25:02] he's showing he says now there was a
[25:04] glory to the law
[25:05] but there was a glory to that which
[25:07] brought death so much glory that when
[25:09] moses came down with the word his face
[25:11] shown that they could not endure
[25:13] the glory of his countenance and he had
[25:14] to veil his face amen
[25:17] and unveiling his face amen he was
[25:19] hiding from them the glory of god they
[25:21] could not endure
[25:23] but now paul's saying now if that was
[25:26] glorious
[25:27] and that was the ministration of death
[25:29] amen that was unto condemnation
[25:31] and that would be done away or fulfilled
[25:33] or completed in christ
[25:35] amen now that which is in righteousness
[25:37] which is in christ
[25:38] will be more glorious still yet that's
[25:42] what paul's saying
[25:43] so now we see a dispensational change
[25:45] moving from the letter
[25:46] to the spirit this is the new testament
[25:49] now let's go to ephesians back to
[25:51] ephesians and go to ephesians chapter 2.
[25:56] they said i'm just laying in a little
[25:57] bit of groundwork here
[25:59] so be patient we'll do a little bible
[26:01] study to get started
[26:03] ephesians chapter 2
[26:08] verse and you hath he quickened who were
[26:11] dead in trespasses and sins
[26:13] wherein in times past you walked
[26:15] according to the course of this world
[26:17] according to the prince of the power of
[26:19] the air the spirit thou now worketh in
[26:21] the children of disobedience
[26:23] among whom also we all had our
[26:25] conversation in time past in the lust of
[26:27] our flesh fulfilling the desire of the
[26:28] flesh
[26:29] and of the mind and we're by nature the
[26:31] children of wrath
[26:32] even as others now if we stop right here
[26:35] if the apostle paul had just brought
[26:37] them another
[26:38] letter of the law amen all he would have
[26:40] done to the gentiles is kill them
[26:44] because this is the condition that the
[26:45] gentiles were in
[26:47] they were trapped in the flesh trapped
[26:50] in the lusts of the flesh
[26:51] they were stuck in this position and if
[26:54] all paul did was minister the new
[26:56] testament
[26:57] with another letter amen superseding the
[27:00] the letter the law the commandments the
[27:02] book of ordinances of moses with a new
[27:04] book of ordinances
[27:05] amen they would they would be stuck in
[27:07] the same situation the jews were stuck
[27:09] in
[27:10] but this is a different dispensation he
[27:12] ministered the spirit
[27:14] now let's read verse three again among
[27:15] whom also we all had our conversation in
[27:17] times past
[27:18] and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[27:20] desire of the flesh and of the mind and
[27:22] we're by nature the children of wrath
[27:24] even as others but god who is rich in
[27:26] mercy for his great love wherewith he
[27:28] loved us
[27:29] even when we were dead and sins hath
[27:31] quickened us together with christ
[27:33] by grace ye are saved and hath raised us
[27:36] up together
[27:37] and made us sit together in heavenly
[27:39] places in christ jesus
[27:41] that in the ages to come he might show
[27:43] the exceeding riches
[27:45] of his grace and his kindness toward us
[27:47] through christ
[27:48] for by grace are you saved through faith
[27:51] and that not of yourselves
[27:52] it is the gift of god not of works lest
[27:55] any man
[27:56] should boast so now we come to this
[28:00] he's telling us now that that
[28:03] you all had your conversations in these
[28:05] evil things in times past
[28:07] but when we were dead in sins when you
[28:10] were dead in sins
[28:12] not knowing god not free from sin when
[28:14] you were dead in sins
[28:16] amen let's read this again verse 5 when
[28:18] we were dead
[28:19] and sins hath quickened us together with
[28:21] christ by grace you are saved
[28:23] and hath raised us up together and made
[28:25] us sit together
[28:26] in heavenly places in christ jesus so
[28:29] now he's
[28:30] bringing to them something different
[28:32] than he brought that moses brought in
[28:33] the law and the ordinances because the
[28:35] people asked for the instructions
[28:37] they got instructions now if they could
[28:39] keep all the instructions they could
[28:40] approach back to god
[28:41] but now he's coming with not the letter
[28:43] he's coming with the spirit
[28:45] but he's giving them a revelation of a
[28:47] mystery
[28:48] he's saying when when christ raised up
[28:51] you raised with him
[28:53] and now ye are seated he hath past
[28:56] tense and now we are seated he hath
[28:58] raised up you are now
[29:00] seated in heavenly places in christ
[29:02] jesus amen so now
[29:04] all of a sudden he took it away from all
[29:06] the ordinances and keeping this
[29:08] and achieving trying to achieve
[29:10] yourselves back to god
[29:12] and now he goes right back to christ
[29:14] which is god's achievement
[29:15] and shows us that our position is
[29:17] already achieved
[29:19] and with our position already achieved
[29:22] amen now
[29:23] we're not trying to get to a certain
[29:26] place
[29:26] he's showing us that in christ we
[29:28] already arrived amen
[29:30] so all we have to do to be benefactors
[29:32] of this position
[29:33] amen is to get in christ and how do you
[29:35] get in christ by one spirit we are all
[29:37] baptized into one body
[29:39] by holy ghost baptism now we are in
[29:41] christ if you're
[29:42] in christ now you're the benefactor of
[29:44] your position which you already had when
[29:46] he died and when he raised and when he
[29:48] ascended on high
[29:49] you already went a total different
[29:54] way of thinking friends he comes with
[29:56] something totally contrary
[29:58] amen to what they asked for they got
[30:00] what they wanted but once they were
[30:02] stuck
[30:02] and what they asked for they found out
[30:04] it was it was
[30:05] it was a it was a carousel to nowhere
[30:08] amen it was an
[30:09] escalator that you never could climb
[30:10] fast enough
[30:13] because man couldn't overcome his own
[30:15] fallen nature
[30:17] he couldn't conquer himself
[30:20] he could not fulfill all the law
[30:23] so god came himself as his son
[30:27] and god fulfilled his own law
[30:30] see god is always just and when you
[30:33] understand the scriptures you
[30:35] understand the nature of god god is
[30:36] always just amen
[30:38] god now he says he's required the law
[30:42] now he can't just wipe it off because
[30:44] he's already established it so what he
[30:46] must do is he must come down and flash
[30:48] but it's got to be virgin born it can't
[30:50] be hybrid anymore
[30:52] amen it's got to be a virgin birth and
[30:53] by that virgin birth
[30:55] he would live his own life through that
[30:57] man and fulfill
[30:58] all his law and when he fulfilled all
[31:00] his law he would prove that now he is a
[31:03] pure
[31:04] spotless clean lamb
[31:07] and that one who had the first one who
[31:10] climbed the escalator
[31:13] the first one who kept the commandments
[31:15] pleased only the father
[31:16] did all that he had commanded the first
[31:19] one now could become the substitutionary
[31:21] offering for everyone else
[31:24] he fulfilled all the law and he took my
[31:27] place
[31:29] so that i could by grace take his
[31:32] he became the substitutionary lamb the
[31:34] lamb of god
[31:36] that would keep the word of god that
[31:37] would keep the law of god that would
[31:39] fulfill the law
[31:41] and die in my place and free me from the
[31:45] bondage that's in the
[31:46] law not that there's anything wrong with
[31:48] the law paul says the law was perfect
[31:51] there was nothing wrong with the law the
[31:52] problem wasn't the law the problem is me
[31:56] so christ fulfilled the law to break me
[31:59] free from the bondage of the law
[32:00] so that now he could cleanse me by his
[32:02] blood redeem me to the father and fill
[32:04] me with his own life
[32:06] and now it's not me that liveth but
[32:08] christ that liveth in me
[32:11] and so now we were we were stuck in this
[32:14] and we're stuck in that but when he
[32:16] raised him
[32:16] up you were raised with him and all of a
[32:18] sudden
[32:19] now the the treadmill religion the the
[32:22] trying
[32:23] to overcome and and it all comes
[32:26] crumbling down
[32:27] and we realize i'm already seated in
[32:29] heavenly places in christ jesus
[32:31] i've already been raised up with him
[32:33] i've already been quickened i've already
[32:35] been raised up i'm already seated
[32:37] in heaven my position is secure and what
[32:40] happens is all of a sudden
[32:41] there's a freedom of liberty that comes
[32:46] the spirit comes and then we can live a
[32:48] life that we've never lived before
[32:53] let's go to matthew 26 i'm still laying
[32:56] a foundation
[32:58] so bear with me matthew 26
[33:01] these things are very familiar to many
[33:03] of us but it's so good to have these
[33:05] things in our understanding as we move
[33:07] forward
[33:07] have it fresh matthew 26
[33:11] and 26 we're at the last supper the lord
[33:14] is eating with his disciples
[33:16] verse 26 he says as they were eating
[33:19] jesus took bread and blessed it and
[33:20] break it and gave it to the disciples
[33:22] and said take
[33:23] eat this is my body and he took the cup
[33:26] and he gave thanks and gave it to them
[33:28] saying drink ye all of it for this is my
[33:30] blood
[33:31] of the new testament which is shed for
[33:32] many for the remission of sins
[33:37] now let's go over to hebrews
[33:40] 9. read one more scripture while we're
[33:44] here
[33:45] hebrews 9
[33:49] and verse 15.
[33:54] hebrews 9 15 and for this cause he's the
[33:57] mediator
[33:58] of the new testament that by means of
[34:01] death
[34:01] for the for the redemption of the
[34:03] transgressions that were under the first
[34:05] testament
[34:06] they which are called might receive the
[34:08] promise of eternal inheritance
[34:11] so by means of his death what did he die
[34:13] for for the redemption
[34:15] of the transgressions that were under
[34:17] the first testament did you have
[34:20] transgressions under the first testament
[34:22] yes lots of them but he died for the
[34:26] redemption of the transgressions that
[34:27] were under the first testament
[34:29] so that we could be freed and so that
[34:31] that law could be fulfilled
[34:33] so that we can move on to the
[34:34] dispensation
[34:36] of grace that's what jesus died for
[34:39] now let's go to romans 8.
[34:49] romans 8 and verse 1.
[34:57] there is therefore now no condemnation
[35:01] to them that are in christ jesus
[35:04] no condemnation no judgment
[35:08] there is therefore now no condemnation
[35:10] to them which are in christ jesus who
[35:11] walk not after the flesh
[35:13] but after the spirit for the law of the
[35:15] spirit of life in
[35:16] christ jesus had made us free from the
[35:18] law of sin
[35:20] and death for what the law could not do
[35:23] in that it was weak through the flesh
[35:26] god sending his own son in the likeness
[35:28] of sinful flesh
[35:29] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[35:32] that the righteousness of the law might
[35:33] be fulfilled in
[35:34] us who walk not after the flesh but
[35:37] after the spirit
[35:38] for they that are after the flesh do
[35:40] mind the things of the flesh
[35:42] but they that are after the spirit the
[35:43] things of the spirit
[35:45] for to be carnally minded as death but
[35:47] to be spiritually minded is life
[35:49] and peace because the carnal mind is
[35:51] enmity against god for it is not subject
[35:53] to the law of god neither indeed can be
[35:56] so then they that are in the flesh
[35:58] cannot please god
[36:00] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[36:02] spirit
[36:03] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[36:05] you now if any man have not the spirit
[36:08] of christ
[36:08] he is none of his so now to be free
[36:11] from the law of sin and death you must
[36:13] be free from carnality you must be free
[36:16] from the flesh
[36:16] now how are you free from the flesh when
[36:18] you still live in the flesh
[36:20] because when you're in the spirit you're
[36:21] free from the flesh
[36:23] because before your new birth came amen
[36:26] you did what the flesh wanted to do you
[36:28] were subject to the desire
[36:29] of the flesh you were subject to the
[36:31] will the will of the flesh and the
[36:33] lustful desires
[36:34] of the flesh but once the new birth came
[36:37] and the spirit came in
[36:38] there came a power that will conquer
[36:40] this flesh
[36:41] even though you're in the flesh you're
[36:42] not of the flesh you can be
[36:44] in the flesh and of the spirit because
[36:46] you're now in the spirits
[36:48] and it's the spirit that gives us power
[36:51] over this flesh amen
[36:53] that's why without the indwelling of the
[36:55] spirit amen without the new testament
[36:57] which is a new covenant
[36:59] without the new covenant of life coming
[37:01] in what life god's life the life that
[37:03] was in christ
[37:04] coming into us without that we could
[37:06] never live
[37:07] free because we could never overcome
[37:09] because not it was not that the law was
[37:11] weak but
[37:12] my flesh made it weak i could never
[37:15] overcome myself
[37:16] amen but god had done something so that
[37:19] he can open a channel
[37:20] up so that he can doubt impart his own
[37:23] life into us
[37:24] and now his life in us can conquer this
[37:27] flesh
[37:30] praise be to god and now by the
[37:33] revelation we're no longer carnally
[37:34] minded
[37:35] but spiritually minded not living to the
[37:38] lust of the flesh
[37:40] verse 9 again but you are not in the
[37:41] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[37:43] the spirit of god dwell in you
[37:45] now if any man have not the spirit of
[37:46] christ he is none of his
[37:48] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[37:50] because of sin
[37:52] but the spirit is life because of
[37:54] righteousness
[37:57] you now are living in a body
[38:01] how many of you are living in a body
[38:03] it's a body of flesh is that right
[38:05] it has a spirit is that right but if you
[38:09] have been made alive in christ jesus
[38:11] then your flesh is dead
[38:14] dad what do you mean and dead dead in
[38:16] the fact that it does not control me
[38:19] there is another life that controls me
[38:21] before
[38:22] amen the spirit well the flesh was alive
[38:25] amen the flesh was very much alive and
[38:27] it was very much in control
[38:28] amen but by the new birth and the
[38:30] indwelling of the spirit
[38:31] i reckon therefore my body now dead
[38:36] and lived by the spirit so i'm living
[38:40] in a dead body
[38:44] i hope you're living in a dead body and
[38:47] we'll understand more as we go let's
[38:48] just keep reading
[38:51] we're standing if christ being you the
[38:53] body is dead because of sin
[38:54] but the spirit is life because of
[38:56] righteousness but of the spirit of him
[38:58] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[39:00] in you
[39:01] he that raised up christ from the dead
[39:02] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[39:04] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[39:08] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[39:10] the flesh to live after the flesh
[39:12] for if you lived after the flesh you
[39:14] shall die
[39:15] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[39:18] the deeds of the body
[39:19] ye shall live this word mortify
[39:23] i just look at the reference in my bible
[39:24] in the center column of my bible
[39:26] it says to make to die
[39:30] the doings of the body
[39:33] if you mortify the deeds of the body if
[39:34] you make to die the doings of the body
[39:38] so it so let's read that again but if
[39:40] you threw the spirit do mortify the
[39:42] deeds of the body
[39:43] you shall live so it's the spirit that
[39:46] tells you
[39:47] no your body says yes but through the
[39:50] spirit
[39:51] you do mortify the deeds of the body you
[39:53] kill it when the body raises up and says
[39:56] look here taste that take that touch
[39:58] this and the spirit raises up
[40:00] and mortifies the deeds of the body and
[40:02] says no way
[40:03] amen this i'm a redeemed vessel i've
[40:05] been given to the lord
[40:06] i'm not going to go that way i don't
[40:08] want to go that way
[40:11] there's so much confusion sometimes in
[40:13] the new birth amen because god takes
[40:15] away the desire for sin
[40:16] but we still live in a flesh body and
[40:18] brother brahm said you have a sticky
[40:20] culkerberg nature
[40:21] then it's going to be tempted the body
[40:23] can be tempted amen so you have to
[40:25] reckon it dead
[40:27] and not you just the tabernacle that you
[40:31] dwell in
[40:32] and you're alive by the spirit you're
[40:34] alive in christ and now through the
[40:36] spirit
[40:36] you must mortify the deeds of the body
[40:44] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[40:46] god they
[40:47] are the sons of god for you have not
[40:50] received the spirit of bondage again to
[40:52] fear
[40:53] but you have received the spirit of
[40:55] adoption whereby we cry
[40:57] abba father the spirit itself bears
[41:00] witness with our spirit
[41:01] that we are the children of god
[41:05] this new covenant did not bring us back
[41:08] into bondage of fear
[41:09] afraid that we would be lost afraid that
[41:11] we'd be cut out afraid we wouldn't be
[41:12] good enough
[41:13] afraid we wouldn't measure up but it's
[41:15] brought us in the spirit in our spirit
[41:17] that agrees with our spirit
[41:19] and that's deep within us that calls out
[41:21] abba
[41:22] father i realize i have a father
[41:26] i'm not trying to get a father i have a
[41:29] father
[41:31] i'm not trying to become a son i've
[41:34] always been a son
[41:36] to different dispensation a different
[41:39] way of thinking
[41:43] let's go to john 16.
[42:00] john 16 and verse 5
[42:04] but now i go my way to him that sent me
[42:07] and none of you asketh me whether goest
[42:09] thou
[42:10] but because i have said these things and
[42:12] to you sorrow hath filled your heart
[42:14] nevertheless i tell you the truth it is
[42:16] expedient for you that i go away
[42:19] for if i go not away the comforter will
[42:21] not come unto you
[42:23] but if i depart i will send him unto you
[42:28] so now you know no doubt the disciples
[42:30] are just men like you and i
[42:32] and when jesus said that he's going to
[42:34] go away all of a sudden
[42:35] you know they're going to feel that
[42:37] separation they begin to sorrow
[42:39] no man even asked him uh they mean
[42:41] sorrow began to fill their heart
[42:43] he said nevertheless i tell you the
[42:45] truth it is expedient for you it's good
[42:48] for you that i go away
[42:49] they're thinking it is a bad thing when
[42:51] jesus would leave because they were
[42:52] under the dispensation of god with us
[42:54] amen
[42:55] they had come from the dispensation of
[42:57] god above us and we know brother brahm
[42:59] told us that it's god above us god with
[43:01] us emmanuel
[43:02] and god in us they were with they were
[43:04] in god
[43:05] above us amen and we talked about this
[43:07] last sunday at communion
[43:08] but and god above us god became a father
[43:10] he became a law giver amen and the
[43:12] ordinances came out and he became a
[43:14] shepherd over a flock and all of these
[43:16] things but
[43:16] but in god above us amen he had to move
[43:20] deeper and now become god with us for
[43:22] the purpose of redemption
[43:23] amen and to reflect and display the very
[43:26] life of god
[43:27] jesus was the reflection of the father
[43:29] jesus was the manifestation of god
[43:32] and so now they're in the dispensation
[43:33] of god with us and i tell you
[43:35] who doesn't want to have god right there
[43:37] next to you amen
[43:39] who doesn't want to be in a boat with
[43:40] god who doesn't want to be eating a meal
[43:42] with god
[43:42] who doesn't want to be across the table
[43:44] with god
[43:46] god emmanuel was with them they wanted
[43:48] to be there but
[43:49] jesus is telling them i'm getting ready
[43:51] to leave you god with you is getting
[43:53] ready
[43:54] to go amen and no doubt they're feeling
[43:56] remorseful we can't do this without you
[43:58] don't go away don't leave us we love
[44:00] this dispensation
[44:02] amen but he's saying it's expedient for
[44:04] you that i go away because if i don't go
[44:06] away i cannot send the comforter to you
[44:08] amen and you cannot come into the
[44:10] dispensation of god
[44:12] in you because the mystery
[44:15] of god could never be completed amen
[44:18] with god above
[44:19] us so the further the mystery what is
[44:22] christ the mystery of god revealed when
[44:24] god was going to reveal himself now he
[44:26] had to come as god
[44:27] with us and god with us was a further
[44:30] declaration of god
[44:31] manifesting god as the son
[44:35] and the and the son was portraying god
[44:37] he was displaying god
[44:38] i mean he he was the very manifestation
[44:40] of god and flesh
[44:41] and that was god with us what was god
[44:43] doing he was revealing the mystery
[44:47] and that part of the mystery was
[44:49] wonderful amen god with you touched you
[44:51] and you were healed
[44:52] and god with you amen broke the bread
[44:55] and god with you
[44:56] amen cursed the storm and god with you
[44:58] helped you walk on water
[44:59] and god with you was a wonderful
[45:01] dispensation amen but that wasn't the
[45:03] last
[45:04] part of the mystery to be revealed there
[45:06] was more mystery to
[45:07] be revealed that could not be revealed
[45:10] under the dispensation of god with you
[45:12] amen there had to come another
[45:14] dispensation for the further revealing
[45:17] of god
[45:19] and so he says jesus is telling them
[45:21] you're sorrowing because i say i go away
[45:24] but you don't know it's the very thing
[45:26] you need
[45:27] amen i'm going away amen but i won't
[45:29] leave you comfortless i will come to you
[45:33] you're not going to be on your own amen
[45:35] you've never had the power to overcome
[45:37] amen
[45:38] now you see a man of flesh who's
[45:41] completely overcome
[45:42] the flesh and overcome the devil and
[45:44] completely fulfilled the law
[45:46] and now you see it and it's amazing amen
[45:48] but i'm telling you
[45:49] jesus said i'm telling you there's
[45:50] something good for you that's comforting
[45:52] something that's expedient for you you
[45:55] need me to go away
[45:57] you don't any longer need god with you
[45:59] what you need for the further revelation
[46:01] of this mystery
[46:02] is god in you because the god that's in
[46:07] you was the one who walked on water was
[46:09] the one who broke the bread
[46:10] was the one who cursed the storm who was
[46:12] the one who kept the word of god
[46:14] amen was the one who brought every demon
[46:17] subject to the word
[46:18] now that's not going to be with you
[46:20] because you could get separated from
[46:21] that over some distance
[46:23] but now that same god is going to be in
[46:26] you
[46:26] to bring the further manifestation of
[46:28] his his
[46:30] mystery revealed
[46:34] we couldn't do it under any other
[46:36] dispensation
[46:37] peter could not overcome peter and the
[46:40] dispensation of god with us
[46:43] because in the dispensation of god with
[46:45] us peter's selfishness rose up and his
[46:47] self-desire rose up
[46:48] when he began to rebuke jesus when jesus
[46:51] says you know i'm going to jerusalem and
[46:52] be evilly mistreated
[46:54] and they're killed and raised again on
[46:55] the third day and peter took him he said
[46:57] far be it from thee
[47:00] and begin to rebuke the lord and the
[47:03] lord said get thee behind me satan
[47:06] see peter could not overcome peter
[47:09] judas could not overcome judas and the
[47:11] dispensation
[47:13] of god with us the disciples began
[47:17] infighting amongst himself on who was
[47:19] going to be the greatest in the kingdom
[47:21] you never hear of them doing that after
[47:24] the dispensation of god in you
[47:28] in the dispensation of god with us amen
[47:32] it could portray god in the form of son
[47:35] amen but his son
[47:36] has to have a bride to finish the
[47:38] masterpiece
[47:40] and that bride amen has to have his same
[47:42] life his same nature
[47:44] same character she has to be a
[47:45] reflection of him just as christ was a
[47:48] reflection of god
[47:49] the bride has to be the reflection of
[47:50] christ
[47:52] and the only way to do it was for him to
[47:54] go away and into going away
[47:56] he was crucified and paid the price he
[47:59] fulfilled all the law and became the
[48:00] substitution
[48:01] so that he could cleanse us by his own
[48:03] blood and purify our vessels by
[48:06] purchasing paying at the redemptive
[48:08] price for all the transgressions that
[48:10] were under the law
[48:11] and purifying us from all those
[48:12] transgressions under the law
[48:14] so that he could justly step into this
[48:16] tabernacle
[48:18] and live his own life in us paul was a
[48:22] minister of the new testament but not of
[48:23] the letter
[48:25] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[48:28] but the spirit giveth life brother brahm
[48:32] says in the message the unveiling of god
[48:34] said and that's god he changed himself
[48:37] from pillar of fire to become a man
[48:39] then he changed himself from that back
[48:41] in the spirit again that he might dwell
[48:43] in man
[48:44] god acting in man what he really was
[48:46] jesus christ was god acting in man
[48:49] in a man and man that's what he was he
[48:52] had changed from the pillar of fire
[48:54] and then had come in which was a veil in
[48:56] the wilderness that hid
[48:58] god from israel moses seen the shape of
[49:00] his body but really he was
[49:02] hid all the time behind this pillar of
[49:04] fire which was the logos that
[49:06] that went out from god now we find that
[49:09] here's now since pentecost god
[49:11] not acting in a man not acting in man
[49:14] now he's acting through man he was
[49:17] acting in a man then
[49:18] then jesus now he is acting through man
[49:21] that he has chosen for this purpose god
[49:24] in the form of man he changed himself
[49:26] from the form of god to a form of man
[49:30] further down a couple paragraphs down he
[49:32] says now
[49:33] when it said here that he emptied
[49:35] himself or poured out
[49:36] now we would think like this that he
[49:38] vomited up the english would have
[49:40] emptied or poured out from him see
[49:41] something went out of him that was
[49:43] different from him
[49:45] so like poured out if you take a glass
[49:47] and brother members explain the actual
[49:49] language
[49:50] if you take a glass and you pour out
[49:52] something something leaves something and
[49:54] you have two different things
[49:57] if i take a glass of water and i pour
[49:59] the water out of the glass of water well
[50:00] i had water and i had a glass and i
[50:02] still have the glass in the water
[50:03] somewhere else
[50:05] but brother bram saying that's not this
[50:08] term
[50:10] he said you could vomit up or the
[50:12] english word emptied out or poured out
[50:14] from him see something went out of him
[50:16] that was different from him but the word
[50:18] kinos in the greek
[50:19] does not mean that he vomit up or his
[50:22] arm went off or his eye went out another
[50:24] person
[50:25] that is he changed himself he poured
[50:28] himself
[50:29] into so god
[50:32] he didn't he didn't just pour himself
[50:34] out and then what came out of him was
[50:36] now sever them he poured himself
[50:38] into another form
[50:42] he changed himself he poured himself
[50:43] into a man into another mask
[50:46] into another form not another person
[50:48] went out of him called the holy spirit
[50:50] but it was he himself you get it he
[50:53] himself
[50:54] poured himself into the people christ in
[50:57] you
[50:59] not something separate but it's him amen
[51:02] now in the new
[51:03] covenant in the new testament we look at
[51:05] old testament new testament but it's an
[51:07] old covenant with the people
[51:09] under the law amen but there's a new
[51:11] covenant with the people
[51:13] and it's a covenant of grace based on
[51:15] faith and not out of yourself it is a
[51:17] gift of god
[51:19] and under this grace dispensation now he
[51:21] comes to dwell inside
[51:22] it's a dispensation of the spirit how
[51:25] beautiful how wonderful to think
[51:26] god pouring himself into the human being
[51:28] into the believer
[51:30] pour out it was part of his drama to do
[51:32] so
[51:33] god all the fullness of the godhead
[51:35] bodily was in this person jesus christ
[51:38] he was god and god alone not a third
[51:40] person or a second person or a first
[51:42] person
[51:42] but the person god failed in human flesh
[51:48] that was my foundation now let's go back
[51:51] to second corinthians
[51:54] for some reason i had to lay that down
[51:56] and i don't even know why
[51:58] but praise be to god we laid it down
[52:03] second corinthians chapter three i'm
[52:04] going to pick up where we left off now
[52:05] in verse 12.
[52:06] and i want to get down to the text that
[52:08] i that i used for this title
[52:10] and which i the title was beholding the
[52:13] mystery
[52:14] and becoming the mystery revealed
[52:17] verse 12 for second corinthians 3 and 12
[52:21] seeing then that we have such hope we
[52:23] use great plainness of speech
[52:25] and not as moses which which put a veil
[52:28] over his face that the children of
[52:30] israel could not steadfastly look
[52:32] to the end of that which is abolished
[52:34] but their minds were blinded
[52:36] for until this day remain at the same
[52:38] veil untaken away in the reading of the
[52:40] old testament
[52:42] which veil is done away in christ
[52:45] but even unto this day when moses is
[52:47] read the veil is upon their heart
[52:50] nevertheless when it shall be turned to
[52:52] the lord the veil shall be taken away
[52:55] now the lord is that spirit and where
[52:57] the spirit of the lord is
[52:59] there is liberty or freedom
[53:03] freedom not bondage but freedom
[53:07] now the lord is that spirit and where
[53:09] the spirit of the lord is there is
[53:10] liberty
[53:11] but we all with open face behold is in a
[53:13] glass
[53:15] now open face he's just referred back to
[53:18] the veil
[53:19] now remember moses when moses had the
[53:22] word i mean he was so bright that they
[53:24] could not endure his brightness so he
[53:25] put a veil over his face
[53:27] and that veil obscured the brightness or
[53:29] the glory
[53:30] from the people and then now paul says
[53:33] but now
[53:34] this veil is on their mind and now when
[53:36] the
[53:37] when moses is read the veil is upon
[53:39] their heart he said but we with open
[53:41] face
[53:42] what he's saying is is we didn't open
[53:44] our face he's saying we have no veil
[53:47] there's nothing to separate us from
[53:50] seeing the glory of god
[53:51] which is now not hidden behind the veil
[53:54] amen the veil is taken away in christ
[53:56] amen
[53:56] now there is no veil the veil the glory
[53:59] the truth the full light of the gospel
[54:01] there's no veil to veil it away from us
[54:06] now we all with open face beholding as
[54:10] in a glass
[54:11] is where glass is mirror now we all with
[54:14] open face beholding is in the glass
[54:16] the glory of the lord are changed into
[54:19] the same image
[54:20] from glory to glory even as by
[54:24] the spirit of the lord now this is a
[54:27] tremendous statement
[54:29] because we with open face now the veil
[54:33] is taken away in christ
[54:34] so when in christ when the veil is taken
[54:36] off the heart and we with open face are
[54:39] now to behold
[54:40] as in a glass the glory of the lord
[54:43] amen it says we are changed
[54:47] into the same image so now when the
[54:51] veil is taken away in christ
[54:54] what what takes away the veil the
[54:56] revelation
[54:58] now when the veil is taken away we with
[55:00] an open face behold is in the glass
[55:03] are changed into the same image
[55:08] from glory to glory even as by
[55:11] the spirit of the lord so the veil must
[55:14] be taken away
[55:15] so that we can see clearly this image
[55:18] and what we see clearly
[55:20] we are changed by what we see
[55:23] after the veil is taken away now
[55:27] in the message it is the rising of the
[55:29] sun brother bam says now
[55:30] the very essence of the message that was
[55:33] sent
[55:33] that he has risen from the dead we his
[55:35] beneficiaries we who share the
[55:37] resurrection with him
[55:38] draw benefits from this by proving to
[55:41] the world that he is alive
[55:43] we cannot do it by word only we cannot
[55:45] do it by some tradition of man
[55:47] we only reflect exactly what we're
[55:50] pointing to
[55:52] so you can only reflect what you're
[55:54] pointing to and the veil has to be taken
[55:56] away
[55:57] to see what we're pointing to i'm afraid
[56:00] today that too many of us are not
[56:01] getting people to christ
[56:03] we're getting them to church to a theory
[56:04] but we must get them to christ he is the
[56:07] only one
[56:08] and the only one that has life he that
[56:10] has the son
[56:12] has life let's go to first corinthians
[56:14] chapter 2.
[56:34] first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 6
[56:36] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[56:38] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[56:40] this world
[56:41] nor the prince of this world that come
[56:43] to not but we speak the wisdom of god
[56:46] in a mystery so paul was speaking the
[56:49] wisdom of god
[56:51] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[56:54] which god ordained before the world unto
[56:57] our glory
[56:58] which none of the princes of this world
[57:00] knew for had they known it they would
[57:02] not have crucified
[57:03] the lord of glory but as it is written i
[57:06] have not seen nor ear heard neither have
[57:08] entered into the heart of man the things
[57:10] which god has prepared for them that
[57:12] love him
[57:12] but god has revealed them to us by his
[57:15] spirit for the spirit searches
[57:17] all things yea the deep things of god
[57:20] i always want to point out here that the
[57:22] spirit searches out the deep things of
[57:25] god
[57:26] there are deep things of god but the
[57:28] spirit searches out the deep things of
[57:30] god
[57:31] so we should never be afraid of the deep
[57:33] things of god
[57:34] because that's part of the manifestation
[57:36] of the spirit to search out the deep
[57:37] things of god
[57:39] for what a man knoweth what man knoweth
[57:41] the things of a man save the spirit of a
[57:42] man
[57:43] which is in him even so the things of
[57:45] god knoweth no man
[57:46] but the spirit of god now we have
[57:48] received not the spirit of the world
[57:51] but the spirit which is of god that we
[57:53] might know the things that are freely
[57:55] given to us
[57:56] of god which things also we speak not in
[57:59] the words which man's wisdom teacheth
[58:01] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[58:03] comparing spiritual things
[58:05] with spiritual but the natural man
[58:07] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[58:09] of god
[58:09] for they are foolishness unto him
[58:11] neither can he know them
[58:12] because they are spiritually discerned
[58:16] so now now paul's saying i'm speaking
[58:20] the wisdom
[58:21] of god in a mystery not the wisdom of
[58:24] the world or even wisdom that the world
[58:26] will understand
[58:27] because the world cannot understand this
[58:29] because no man can understand it without
[58:31] the spirit
[58:32] no the spirit of a man understands the
[58:34] things of man
[58:35] but only the spirit of god will
[58:37] understand or comprehend the things that
[58:38] be of god
[58:40] so these things that paul's speaking
[58:42] he's not speaking natural things
[58:44] as of carnal but he's speaking things
[58:46] that are that the spiritual things
[58:48] comparing spiritual with spiritual
[58:51] amen so that now they that these things
[58:54] that will be known
[58:55] their foolishness to the world because
[58:57] they're not carnally understood
[58:59] so you see it can never be textbook
[59:01] friends because
[59:02] it cannot be carnally comprehended
[59:06] it's paul did not come down to set
[59:08] something up new
[59:09] so that they can start a new school and
[59:11] then the new school can start a debate
[59:13] just like they did with moses's law
[59:15] but now he's bringing something that can
[59:17] only be discerned because he's preaching
[59:19] in a mystery form and the mystery form
[59:21] can only be revealed by the spirit
[59:24] you have to god god has given the word
[59:27] in a mystery god has known it a mystery
[59:28] there is a mystery of god
[59:30] and only the deep things of god can be
[59:32] known by the spirit of god
[59:35] so paul is preaching the gospel in a
[59:37] mystery
[59:39] he's not bringing a letter he's bringing
[59:41] the spirit
[59:42] amen because he's bringing in a mystery
[59:45] and the only
[59:46] ones that will know what paul was
[59:47] actually preaching are those who get the
[59:50] spirit
[59:51] because they are spiritually discerned
[59:55] now i hope you have your spiritual
[59:56] jacket on because brother branham
[59:58] brought us right back to paul's teaching
[1:00:00] and brother bannon brought us to the
[1:00:01] mystery of god amen because the seventh
[1:00:03] angel
[1:00:04] was going to reveal the mystery of god
[1:00:06] amen but he was not going to do it in a
[1:00:09] way
[1:00:09] that was intellectual that would start a
[1:00:11] textbook and start a debate
[1:00:12] because the mystery of god is only known
[1:00:15] by the spirit of god
[1:00:17] and he's not teaching in ways that
[1:00:19] carnal minds will comprehend
[1:00:21] he's teaching it comparing spiritual
[1:00:24] things
[1:00:24] with spiritual so how does he begin
[1:00:28] teaching the sin the mystery of god
[1:00:30] revealed in the seventh seal he has to
[1:00:31] compare spiritual things with spiritual
[1:00:34] so he goes back and he begins to show
[1:00:36] you god's original creation in the
[1:00:38] garden of eden
[1:00:38] god made a man and out of a man came a
[1:00:40] woman and then he united the two
[1:00:42] together and then god went and took his
[1:00:44] rest
[1:00:46] so what's the seventh seal
[1:00:49] it's not carnally comprehended friends
[1:00:52] it's he's comparing spiritual things
[1:00:54] with spiritual things so that the
[1:00:55] spiritual mind will
[1:00:57] pick it up because you can he speaks
[1:00:59] plainly he speaks openly
[1:01:01] he speaks boldly amen he's not speaking
[1:01:03] in code he's not speaking another
[1:01:05] language
[1:01:05] he's speaking plain english but he's
[1:01:07] preaching it in a mystery
[1:01:09] he's preaching the mystery in a mystery
[1:01:14] that cannot be carnally pieced together
[1:01:19] the more we carnally piece it together
[1:01:21] the more weird stuff we're going to come
[1:01:22] up with
[1:01:27] but it's spiritually discerned
[1:01:30] and we're in the dispensation of the
[1:01:32] spirit where where jesus himself said
[1:01:34] it's good for you
[1:01:36] that i go away it's good for you that i
[1:01:40] go away because you need the comforter
[1:01:42] you need the holy ghost you need the
[1:01:43] teacher
[1:01:45] that'll teach you all things that i have
[1:01:48] said
[1:01:49] this is the dispensation that we're
[1:01:51] under that's why the message cannot be
[1:01:54] understood without the spirit
[1:01:56] paul's message could not be understood
[1:01:58] without the spirit he says to man it's
[1:02:00] foolishness
[1:02:01] because it can't be comprehended by
[1:02:03] carnal mind it's only by
[1:02:04] spiritual discernment so even paul's
[1:02:07] message
[1:02:08] was foolishness to the carnal mind
[1:02:11] paul's message could only be understood
[1:02:13] by the spirits
[1:02:16] that's why there's so many denominations
[1:02:18] and every seminary has failed because
[1:02:20] they tried
[1:02:21] amen they tried to explain it through
[1:02:23] wisdom and reasoning and knowledge and
[1:02:25] understanding
[1:02:26] and in doing so they would divide and
[1:02:28] divide and divide and divide
[1:02:30] and have so many different kinds of
[1:02:31] understanding that is some confusion
[1:02:33] because they're trying to intellect the
[1:02:35] knowledge
[1:02:36] amen to understand what paul taught amen
[1:02:39] and you can't understand what paul
[1:02:40] taught
[1:02:41] and without the spirit of god
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:46] and we cannot understand what brother
[1:02:48] branham taught without the spirit of god
[1:02:53] let's move on in the revelation of jesus
[1:02:57] christ from the church age book
[1:02:59] brother man said oh how we need
[1:03:01] revelation by the spirit
[1:03:04] we don't need a new bible we don't need
[1:03:05] a new translation though some are very
[1:03:07] good and i'm not against them
[1:03:08] but we need the revelation of the spirit
[1:03:12] and thank god we can have what we need
[1:03:14] for god wants to reveal his word to
[1:03:16] us by his spirit may god begin by a
[1:03:19] spirit to give us
[1:03:20] continuous listen closely may god by his
[1:03:23] spirit
[1:03:24] by his spirit may god begin by his
[1:03:27] spirit to give us continuous
[1:03:30] life-giving and prevailing revelation
[1:03:34] life-giving you see when people begin
[1:03:38] you know sometimes you'll you'll see
[1:03:40] people who will
[1:03:42] chastise individuals who who feed off
[1:03:45] the revelation of christ
[1:03:48] and who ser by the spirit search out the
[1:03:51] deep things of god
[1:03:52] and and they say oh you know it's always
[1:03:54] got to be a revelation it's always got
[1:03:55] to be mystery it's always got to be this
[1:03:58] but brother brenham said the revelation
[1:04:00] of the mystery is life-giving
[1:04:03] it actually gives life to the seed it
[1:04:06] actually gives
[1:04:06] life to the to the god that's on the
[1:04:08] inside to the attribute of god
[1:04:10] what gives life to that the revelation
[1:04:13] by the spirit is
[1:04:14] life-giving friends
[1:04:17] you know you know some people want to
[1:04:18] simplify the message and dumb it down
[1:04:20] all they want to do is do what the
[1:04:22] baptist did to paul's message
[1:04:23] and we're not going to do what the
[1:04:25] baptist did to paul's message to this
[1:04:27] message of this hour
[1:04:28] it was preached in a mystery it's
[1:04:30] revealed by the spirit we're not here to
[1:04:32] water it down and simplify
[1:04:33] to where we can get anybody to pass the
[1:04:35] test abc
[1:04:37] pick one all right you got a 95 you're a
[1:04:39] believer it's not that way friends
[1:04:42] god secured it by revelation god kept it
[1:04:45] a mystery amen so that it'd be hid from
[1:04:47] the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:04:48] revealed
[1:04:49] unto the children of god
[1:04:53] and so we preach a mystery yes it's a
[1:04:54] mystery it's a deep mystery of god
[1:04:57] there's the deep things of god but i
[1:04:59] tell you friends the spirit is here god
[1:05:01] wants to give revelation of his word god
[1:05:04] wants to reveal himself
[1:05:05] god wants in this day to unveil himself
[1:05:08] he wants to be known by his bride
[1:05:09] he wants to unveil himself to his bride
[1:05:12] so what we must do we must pray
[1:05:14] for continuous life-giving revelation
[1:05:19] when paul preached the mystery amen and
[1:05:22] the jews rejected it amen but the
[1:05:24] gentiles picked it up
[1:05:27] the jews were more versed
[1:05:32] the jews were more educated they were
[1:05:34] more versed in the law and the prophets
[1:05:36] amen they had more opportunity than they
[1:05:38] had more scripts
[1:05:39] they had more access to that even in the
[1:05:41] proselyte jews which were the gentiles
[1:05:43] that were innocent the synagogues amen
[1:05:45] they still weren't born jew they still
[1:05:47] weren't raised up
[1:05:48] who knows when they became proselyte
[1:05:49] jews but they didn't have the advantage
[1:05:52] and knowledge
[1:05:52] they didn't have the advantage in
[1:05:54] education they didn't have the advantage
[1:05:56] in having it in their
[1:05:57] original language
[1:06:01] but when paul would preach the mystery
[1:06:03] the jews would reject it
[1:06:05] and then the gentiles would hear him
[1:06:06] gladly as many as were ordained into
[1:06:09] eternal life
[1:06:10] heard him gladly receive the truth amen
[1:06:13] why because this revelation is
[1:06:16] life-giving to the seed amen
[1:06:18] it's life-giving to the attribute and
[1:06:20] nature of god
[1:06:23] so paul didn't have to change it
[1:06:27] paul just preached the mystery
[1:06:33] so now i want to read this this verse
[1:06:35] this
[1:06:36] sentence again may god begin by his
[1:06:38] spirit to give us continuous
[1:06:40] life-giving and prevailing revelation
[1:06:44] that means the revelation is life-giving
[1:06:46] but the revelation is also prevailing
[1:06:50] it will prevail everything else in our
[1:06:52] lives
[1:06:53] this revelation will prevail our will it
[1:06:56] will prevail our past
[1:06:58] it will prevail our education it'll
[1:07:00] prevail our own thinking
[1:07:02] it has to be prevailing revelation
[1:07:06] then he goes on to say oh if the church
[1:07:09] if the church could only get a fresh
[1:07:11] revelation
[1:07:13] become by it the living word manifested
[1:07:19] who wants to be the living word
[1:07:20] manifested it'll take a fresh revelation
[1:07:24] amen not an education but a fresh
[1:07:26] revelation amen
[1:07:28] oh if the church could only get a fresh
[1:07:29] revelation of god
[1:07:31] and become by it the living word
[1:07:34] manifested
[1:07:35] we would do the greater works and
[1:07:36] glorify god our father in heaven
[1:07:39] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:07:41] revealed he says he is the first fruits
[1:07:43] of the resurrection is that right
[1:07:46] watch then what is he he is the head of
[1:07:48] the body
[1:07:49] which is the church bride then the bride
[1:07:52] body must follow the head
[1:07:54] for it is part of his resurrection and
[1:07:58] part of the mystery
[1:08:01] what mystery the mystery of christ who
[1:08:04] is the mystery of god
[1:08:05] revealed so
[1:08:09] the bride body must follow the head what
[1:08:11] is the head the head is christ
[1:08:13] what is christ the anointed word amen
[1:08:15] and brother said the anointed word for
[1:08:17] your day
[1:08:17] amen so they must follow the head for it
[1:08:20] is part
[1:08:22] for it is part of his resurrection
[1:08:26] whose resurrection his resurrection
[1:08:29] who's part of his resurrection the bride
[1:08:31] it's part of whose resurrection his
[1:08:34] resurrection
[1:08:35] i thought she'd be part of her
[1:08:36] resurrection
[1:08:39] no she's part of his resurrection
[1:08:42] because brother brahm said the word has
[1:08:43] been laying dead now for years but it's
[1:08:45] beginning to rise
[1:08:46] amen rose through luther rose through
[1:08:49] wesley roasted pentecost but now she's
[1:08:50] standing on her feet amen now
[1:08:52] amen she's part of the resurrection
[1:08:56] and part of the mystery
[1:08:59] it's possible it's impossible for it not
[1:09:02] to go
[1:09:03] oh my it's part of god's mystery how god
[1:09:06] revealed himself here and raised it up
[1:09:08] by the word
[1:09:09] so he reveals his church and raising it
[1:09:12] up by the same word
[1:09:13] it's part of his threefold mystery as
[1:09:16] the head was took from the grave so must
[1:09:17] the body follow him back to eden
[1:09:19] where the head of the family the man the
[1:09:21] bridegroom the bride being the body of
[1:09:23] the bridegroom
[1:09:24] must follow the bride because that's the
[1:09:27] head
[1:09:28] and the head is revealed and come back
[1:09:31] with eternal life
[1:09:32] and the mod the body must follow that
[1:09:35] you got that and the head is revealed
[1:09:37] and come back with eternal life
[1:09:39] and the body must follow that because
[1:09:41] it's husband and wife again
[1:09:44] and as long as you're impregnated with
[1:09:45] the same word which is his body
[1:09:48] you've took his body become in him when
[1:09:51] you took the word
[1:09:53] not the creed the word oh my
[1:09:58] this bride body is part of the mystery
[1:10:03] part of the mystery and the mystery
[1:10:07] is revealed by the spirit of god
[1:10:11] and the message is this the sign of the
[1:10:13] answer i'm going to go through a
[1:10:15] sequence
[1:10:16] of of quotes here but is this the sign
[1:10:18] of the answers when brother branham
[1:10:20] comes in december of 1962
[1:10:22] and he preaches about the vision that
[1:10:24] he's had of the little birds coming and
[1:10:26] then the bigger birds and the
[1:10:27] constellation of angels
[1:10:29] and he's being called to go out west
[1:10:31] amen for the revelation of the seven
[1:10:32] seals
[1:10:33] and he's coming and he's telling all
[1:10:34] this he's telling the dreams that
[1:10:36] happened from the believers
[1:10:37] he tells the vision and now he's in here
[1:10:40] and is this the sign of this the answer
[1:10:42] and he's preaching this
[1:10:44] before he preached the seals now he's
[1:10:45] going to go out west he's going to go
[1:10:48] move his family out west he's going to
[1:10:49] have the experience somewhere around
[1:10:51] january
[1:10:52] of the sword being dropped into his hand
[1:10:54] which is the sword
[1:10:55] of the lord which is the word of god
[1:10:57] placed in his hand
[1:10:58] and he said it fit my hand just right
[1:11:02] because the word came to the hand of the
[1:11:03] prophet amen and then
[1:11:05] in in i think early march he's going to
[1:11:08] have this experience
[1:11:09] with the angels he's going to come back
[1:11:11] in the mid part of march and he's going
[1:11:12] to begin preaching
[1:11:14] the revelation of the seven seals but
[1:11:16] here he is in december of 1962 before he
[1:11:19] goes out west
[1:11:20] he says and the seven thunders right in
[1:11:23] the revelation here of jesus christ
[1:11:26] it's some mystery does not the bible say
[1:11:28] that this this revelation of jesus
[1:11:30] christ
[1:11:31] and when you go all the way to the
[1:11:33] beginning of the book of revelation
[1:11:34] it begins in verse 1 telling us that
[1:11:37] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:11:39] so the book of revelations is the
[1:11:41] revelation of jesus christ
[1:11:43] amen and brother branham is now taking
[1:11:45] that and he's saying these seven
[1:11:47] thunders and he's going all the way over
[1:11:48] to revelations 10
[1:11:50] 1-7 in revelations 10 7 thunders uttered
[1:11:54] their voice and john said i was about to
[1:11:56] write
[1:11:56] amen but a voice from heaven said write
[1:11:58] it not and seal it up
[1:12:02] and so now brother branham's looking you
[1:12:04] know he sees the symbols here and the
[1:12:06] symbols here and interpretations here
[1:12:08] and symbols here
[1:12:09] and everything is in symbol form with
[1:12:11] some of them already being interpreted
[1:12:13] in the church or in the book of
[1:12:14] revelation but he gets to these seven
[1:12:17] thunders but the seven thunders don't
[1:12:18] have a symbol they don't have any
[1:12:20] revelation they don't have anything
[1:12:21] behind them
[1:12:22] they're sealed up but brother branham
[1:12:24] knows that this is the revelation of
[1:12:26] jesus christ
[1:12:29] the book of revelation is the revelation
[1:12:31] of jesus christ
[1:12:32] and the revelation of jesus christ has
[1:12:34] to be finished to his bride
[1:12:37] before she can rapture it's got to be
[1:12:39] finished so he knows
[1:12:40] that there's something there in those
[1:12:42] seven thunders there were seven thunders
[1:12:44] that uttered voices
[1:12:45] but john was told not to write so
[1:12:47] there's something laying in those seven
[1:12:49] thunders that have to be revealed
[1:12:51] because it's the revelation of jesus
[1:12:53] christ
[1:12:57] does not the bible say the revelation of
[1:12:59] jesus christ
[1:13:00] why there is some hidden mystery then of
[1:13:02] it hmm
[1:13:04] what is it the seven thunders have it
[1:13:07] for john was just about to write and a
[1:13:09] voice come down from heaven said don't
[1:13:11] write it but seal it up
[1:13:12] seal it up put it on the back side of
[1:13:14] the book it's got to be revealed
[1:13:17] it's the mysteries in revelation
[1:13:20] 10 7 we know what so well says but in
[1:13:22] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:13:24] angel
[1:13:25] that's this prophet when he shall begin
[1:13:28] to sound
[1:13:29] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:13:33] finished so brother branham knows these
[1:13:36] seven thunders have to be revealed
[1:13:39] there can't be the mystery of god
[1:13:41] continue on past the days of the voice
[1:13:43] of the seventh angel
[1:13:45] amen he's got to sound this mystery so
[1:13:47] there has to be a revelation of those
[1:13:49] seven thunders
[1:13:51] when they shall begin to sound the
[1:13:53] mystery of god should be finished
[1:13:55] as he hath declared to his servants the
[1:13:57] prophets
[1:13:58] then he comes to the first seal and he's
[1:14:00] preaching the first jesus says now
[1:14:02] takes the book of seals and breaks them
[1:14:06] and shows the seventh angel
[1:14:07] for this alone the mysteries of god
[1:14:12] is the ministry of the seventh angel now
[1:14:15] we just come through the church ages
[1:14:16] with even history prove that
[1:14:18] the angel's message of the seven church
[1:14:20] all right reveals all the mysteries
[1:14:22] that's been in the past all the things
[1:14:24] in the past revelation 10 1-7
[1:14:27] that's to be so brother i'm saying this
[1:14:29] is the this
[1:14:30] is the ministry of the seventh angel is
[1:14:33] to reveal those hidden mysteries
[1:14:35] what the seven thunders utter this is
[1:14:38] the ministry
[1:14:39] of the seventh angel so those things
[1:14:41] that john was told not to write up they
[1:14:42] were revealed they were spoken john
[1:14:44] heard them
[1:14:45] they were something there was something
[1:14:47] to it something was actually said
[1:14:50] but what was said was sealed up amen
[1:14:53] but john is told at the end of the book
[1:14:55] to seal it not amen so there has to come
[1:14:57] a time that what was sealed is going to
[1:14:59] have to be unsealed
[1:15:00] and this is the ministry of the seventh
[1:15:02] angel
[1:15:05] further in the first seal he says and
[1:15:07] then there's coming forth
[1:15:08] seven mysterious thunders that's not
[1:15:11] even written at all
[1:15:12] that's right and i believe that through
[1:15:14] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[1:15:16] the last days
[1:15:18] in order to get the bride together for
[1:15:20] rapturing faith
[1:15:21] because what we got right now we
[1:15:24] wouldn't be able to do it
[1:15:26] there's something we've got to step
[1:15:27] farther we can't have enough faith for
[1:15:30] divine healing hardly
[1:15:31] we've got to have enough faith to be
[1:15:33] changed in a moment
[1:15:34] and be swept out of this earth and we'll
[1:15:36] find that after a while
[1:15:38] the lord willing find where it's at
[1:15:41] the brotherhood is saying there's got to
[1:15:43] come a revelation
[1:15:44] there's got to come something that will
[1:15:45] step us farther and brother branham had
[1:15:48] preached his ministry all the way up
[1:15:50] he's in the first seal
[1:15:51] amen he had tied together the loose sins
[1:15:53] that was left off to the reformers
[1:15:55] he had brought back the correct teaching
[1:15:56] of what paul taught on baptism on
[1:15:58] serpent seed on godhead
[1:16:00] and then he restored back church order
[1:16:02] he'd restored back all of this but he
[1:16:04] said there's something that's got to
[1:16:05] come
[1:16:06] there's a mystery in the bible there's a
[1:16:08] mystery under the seven thunders there's
[1:16:10] a mystery of god that's got to be
[1:16:11] revealed by the seventh angel
[1:16:13] and he said that's got to come to take
[1:16:15] us a step further
[1:16:21] praise god and christ is the mystery of
[1:16:25] god revealed he says
[1:16:26] he has showed or revealed in every type
[1:16:29] that's in the bible
[1:16:31] if you notice i'm skipping from
[1:16:33] sergeants that's the time before
[1:16:35] to the seals and now after the seals he
[1:16:37] comes and preaches christ is the mystery
[1:16:39] of god real
[1:16:39] remember the ministry of the seventh
[1:16:42] angel is these mysteries
[1:16:44] and when you go to revelation 10 7 he
[1:16:46] said in the days of the voice of the
[1:16:47] seventh angel the mystery of god shall
[1:16:49] be revealed
[1:16:50] so there is a mystery of god that has to
[1:16:52] be revealed
[1:16:54] so there's mysteries to be revealed
[1:16:56] plural but there's a
[1:16:57] mystery also to be revealed and he has
[1:17:00] to reveal the mysteries
[1:17:02] before he can reveal the mystery and in
[1:17:04] revealing the mysteries
[1:17:06] he will be declaring the mystery
[1:17:14] amen
[1:17:17] that's why you can't put this in a
[1:17:19] textbook
[1:17:21] you can't sit down in sketches on a
[1:17:23] diagram of somebody oh i got it now
[1:17:24] it doesn't come by education friends it
[1:17:26] comes by the spirit
[1:17:28] it's a mystery and the mysteries are
[1:17:29] revealed by the spirit
[1:17:35] christ is mr god revealed he has showed
[1:17:37] or revealed it in every type
[1:17:40] that's in the bible what does he show
[1:17:42] this great mystery the mystery of god
[1:17:45] because by the time we get to christ as
[1:17:46] the mystery of god revealed brother
[1:17:48] branham's finished revealing the
[1:17:49] mysteries
[1:17:52] see the revelation of the seven thunders
[1:17:54] was revealing
[1:17:55] amen revealing what the the what the
[1:17:58] seven seals were what the symbols were
[1:18:00] of the seven seals because when the
[1:18:02] seven seals were open in revelation
[1:18:04] chapter six
[1:18:05] amen there were six of them opened in
[1:18:07] revelation chapter six and we saw
[1:18:08] a white horse rider and a black or a red
[1:18:12] horse rider black horse rider
[1:18:13] we saw all these symbology and now
[1:18:15] brother brenham under the thunders the
[1:18:17] thunders contain the revelation of what
[1:18:19] all that was
[1:18:20] and brother branham goes under the seven
[1:18:21] thunders and and he begins to
[1:18:23] reveal all the mysteries
[1:18:27] but there's a there's a seventh amen
[1:18:29] there's a seventh mystery there's a
[1:18:31] seventh seal
[1:18:32] and when you look at seven seal in
[1:18:33] revelation chapter eight when the
[1:18:35] seventh seal was opened there was
[1:18:36] silence
[1:18:38] brother bennett said silence nothing was
[1:18:41] spoken
[1:18:42] nothing was revealed there was no
[1:18:45] symbol amen and he said over here in
[1:18:47] revelation 10 when the seven thunders
[1:18:49] uttered he was told not to write see
[1:18:51] silence he said it must be connected
[1:18:53] together
[1:18:55] so the seventh seal was silenced no
[1:18:58] symbols no nothing
[1:18:59] there were the the the seven thunders
[1:19:01] that uttered no
[1:19:02] symbols no nothing there was also
[1:19:04] silence
[1:19:07] so these two things go together so under
[1:19:09] the revealing of the seventh seal
[1:19:11] amen christ himself will come
[1:19:15] to open the seals because only the lamb
[1:19:19] can open the book
[1:19:21] so under the mystery of the seventh seal
[1:19:23] amen christ himself will come
[1:19:25] amen to reveal the mysteries under the
[1:19:28] seven thunders amen
[1:19:30] will reveal and tie together the loose
[1:19:32] sins and reveal
[1:19:33] all the mysteries and brother branham
[1:19:35] will go through six seals
[1:19:37] and in six seals he will go through
[1:19:39] great explanation
[1:19:42] the white horse means this it symbolize
[1:19:44] this this time in history this happened
[1:19:46] and great details of much information
[1:19:48] all the way through the six seals but
[1:19:50] when brother branham gets to the seventh
[1:19:52] seal
[1:19:53] brother branham doesn't tell you what
[1:19:55] the seventh seal
[1:19:56] is and the same way he told you what
[1:19:58] this first six seals were
[1:20:01] because in the first six seals he's
[1:20:02] revealing the mystery but in the seventh
[1:20:04] seal he's revealing the mystery
[1:20:07] because it's the mystery that revealed
[1:20:09] the mysteries
[1:20:12] i hope i'm not confusing you just read
[1:20:16] the message and come listen to this
[1:20:17] again
[1:20:18] and just just lay in the presence of the
[1:20:20] lord and ask god to bring revelation
[1:20:22] and all the sudden things will begin to
[1:20:23] click and you say i know what he's
[1:20:25] talking about now
[1:20:27] but the mystery was the mystery of god
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:31] in christ as the mystery god revealed
[1:20:33] and christ himself came
[1:20:34] amen and that's what that cloud
[1:20:36] represents when you look at the cloud
[1:20:38] brother man first saw it as a pyramid of
[1:20:40] angels a constellation of angels
[1:20:41] the seven angels amen representing amen
[1:20:44] the church age is complete
[1:20:45] now come down but later he was told to
[1:20:48] take the picture and turn it to the
[1:20:49] right
[1:20:49] and when he turned it to the right he
[1:20:51] saw the face of christ and he recognized
[1:20:53] this was the headship coming down this
[1:20:55] was the lord coming to open the seals
[1:21:00] he christ is the mystery of god he is
[1:21:02] that mystery
[1:21:04] that was revealed in the days of the
[1:21:06] voice of the seventh angel when that
[1:21:07] mystery is finished
[1:21:10] and that mystery came down to reveal
[1:21:12] those six mysteries
[1:21:16] and in revealing the six mysteries
[1:21:19] he was actively revealing the seventh
[1:21:24] because the seventh seal in revelations
[1:21:26] one is silence
[1:21:28] no symbols and the seven thunders which
[1:21:31] is the revelations contained under the
[1:21:33] seven seals
[1:21:34] was silence nothing written and the two
[1:21:36] go together
[1:21:37] so at the time when the lord comes to
[1:21:39] reveal the seals
[1:21:41] he comes down and by revealing the seals
[1:21:44] he's showing you who's here
[1:21:49] he's dispensing the revelation of the
[1:21:51] first seal
[1:21:52] and the revelation the second seal the
[1:21:55] revelation and brother ben is saying i
[1:21:56] hope you see what's going on it's going
[1:21:58] on all around you
[1:22:00] i hope you're catching it i hope i don't
[1:22:02] have to come right out and say it
[1:22:07] and now the seventh seal himself
[1:22:10] christ the mystery of god is present
[1:22:15] because he's the only one that can open
[1:22:17] the seals
[1:22:18] brother venom can't open the seals
[1:22:21] only christ can open those seals so
[1:22:24] christ was present opening the seals and
[1:22:27] what's he doing
[1:22:29] he's manifesting the seventh seal
[1:22:33] because only the seventh seal christ can
[1:22:36] open the six seals
[1:22:39] so when brother branham comes to the
[1:22:41] seventh seal
[1:22:42] he begins talking and in the seventh
[1:22:44] seal he goes back over the sixth seal
[1:22:47] because they all overlap one overlaps
[1:22:48] the other even in preaching he has to
[1:22:50] overlap them because they always overlap
[1:22:52] each other everything he did was perfect
[1:22:55] these seals and now when he when he's
[1:22:58] preaching the seventh seal
[1:22:59] he comes to the seventh seal and he gets
[1:23:02] just to the part where he's about ready
[1:23:04] to tell you what the seven seal is
[1:23:05] because you kind of learn his cadence
[1:23:06] you kind of learn his demeanor
[1:23:08] through the first seals he would start
[1:23:09] off and he would kind of go back and
[1:23:11] reflect back and then he would lay the
[1:23:12] foundation and go through the scriptures
[1:23:14] and he would start to break it down
[1:23:15] he's doing the seventh thing and the
[1:23:17] same thing in the seventh seal he's
[1:23:18] going back over the sixth deal he's
[1:23:20] laying it all out
[1:23:21] he's reviewing back now he's getting to
[1:23:23] the part where he's just about to lay it
[1:23:24] down
[1:23:25] and he says i feel to stop right here
[1:23:30] because in the revelation of the seventh
[1:23:33] seal in revelation
[1:23:34] chapter 8 1 there was silence
[1:23:38] but he is going to preach the seventh
[1:23:41] seal he is going to teach the seven seal
[1:23:44] amen but he's not going to do it
[1:23:45] according to carnal mind so the carnal
[1:23:47] mind will pick it up into reasoning but
[1:23:49] he's going to do it comparing
[1:23:51] spiritual things with spiritual things
[1:23:55] so after he says stop i feel to stop
[1:23:57] then he says
[1:23:58] do you remember the baby shoe
[1:24:01] when you can't teach these things
[1:24:03] spiritual things the pentecostal babies
[1:24:05] now remember the tent
[1:24:06] the tent is the third pool and when he
[1:24:08] in the tent vision he's caught up and he
[1:24:10] sees this great big tent and he sees the
[1:24:12] platform and you know all of that the
[1:24:13] angel says this will be your third pool
[1:24:17] but then brother bram says now remember
[1:24:19] sabino cannon that sword in my hand
[1:24:21] what's he doing he is comparing
[1:24:23] spiritual things with spiritual things
[1:24:26] so that the spirit can come and pick it
[1:24:28] up amen because
[1:24:29] it was taught in a mystery paul taught
[1:24:31] it in a mystery that the carnal mind
[1:24:33] could not pick up
[1:24:36] and brother bannon what's he doing he is
[1:24:38] preaching the seventh seal
[1:24:39] but he's not going to do it with
[1:24:41] information he's not going to do it
[1:24:43] saying this equals that and this week
[1:24:44] was that
[1:24:45] he's doing the same thing comparing
[1:24:47] spiritual things with spiritual things
[1:24:51] he said now remember the sword in the
[1:24:53] hand and remember
[1:24:55] and when when brother bram tells the
[1:24:58] prophecy of the sword dropping through
[1:25:00] his hand he said it just fit me just
[1:25:01] right and we know all that he said this
[1:25:03] is the
[1:25:03] sword uh the king sword and he said the
[1:25:06] sword is the word
[1:25:08] fit my hand just right but then the
[1:25:11] voice says
[1:25:12] this is your third pool
[1:25:17] so brother branham after he says stop
[1:25:21] i don't feel to go anymore. he goes to
[1:25:23] the vision that was prophesying a third
[1:25:25] pool
[1:25:26] and he goes through the experience and
[1:25:28] spilling pinot canyon says this is your
[1:25:29] third pool
[1:25:31] so that you would know that the third
[1:25:32] pool would come
[1:25:35] that it was the opening of the word that
[1:25:37] christ had come
[1:25:39] because christ is the only one that can
[1:25:41] reveal those seals
[1:25:44] see he's preaching the seventh seal in
[1:25:46] the mystery
[1:25:48] and it wasn't the information it was the
[1:25:51] life
[1:25:53] brother branham was displaying the
[1:25:54] seventh seal because it was elohim in
[1:25:56] his flesh
[1:25:58] could turn his back to the tent until
[1:26:00] sarah what she was thinking behind her
[1:26:03] he was manifesting amen only christ
[1:26:06] only christ could open those seals but
[1:26:08] he tore off those seals and threw him
[1:26:09] down to a seventh church aged messenger
[1:26:11] who gave him out to the people
[1:26:12] so here he's now working in and through
[1:26:14] the seventh church and messenger what is
[1:26:16] it it's christ it's the seventh seal
[1:26:19] because who's giving us who's giving us
[1:26:22] the revelation of the seven seals it's
[1:26:23] coming from the seventh church aged
[1:26:24] messenger
[1:26:26] who opened it christ it could only be
[1:26:29] him
[1:26:30] but where's christ at he was in that
[1:26:32] little man
[1:26:34] what is that that's the mystery of god
[1:26:36] revealed
[1:26:38] that is the mystery in our day that is
[1:26:41] the mystery of god
[1:26:42] finished he was showing it finished
[1:26:46] the mystery of god was god above us then
[1:26:48] god with us
[1:26:49] and now god in us god above us is father
[1:26:53] god with us his son
[1:26:54] god in us is holy ghost what is it it's
[1:26:56] the godhead
[1:26:58] it's the mystery of god being finished
[1:27:01] in our day friends
[1:27:02] amen and it's preached in a mystery form
[1:27:04] but it takes
[1:27:05] prevailing life-giving revelation amen
[1:27:09] and by that revelation we can become the
[1:27:11] word made manifest in this hour
[1:27:20] praise god i don't even think i finished
[1:27:24] my quote
[1:27:26] he has showed it or revealed in every
[1:27:28] type that's in the bible
[1:27:30] what's he coming to the seventh seal
[1:27:35] therefore the entire bible is the
[1:27:37] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[1:27:41] hmm the entire bible is an expression of
[1:27:45] one goal that god had
[1:27:48] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:27:50] entire bible
[1:27:52] and the acts of the believers in the
[1:27:54] bible has been in type
[1:27:55] in expressing what god's great goal is
[1:27:58] and now
[1:27:58] in this last day he has revealed it and
[1:28:01] shows
[1:28:01] it and god's help well you'll see it
[1:28:05] right here this morning
[1:28:06] what the lord has had in his mind all
[1:28:08] along and has expressed it
[1:28:12] what's brother bradham doing comparing
[1:28:13] spiritual things with spiritual
[1:28:17] further in christ is the mystery he says
[1:28:20] here come luther through
[1:28:22] he only preached justification
[1:28:26] or he only preached justification just
[1:28:28] pounded away in that age
[1:28:29] he didn't know what the age was here
[1:28:31] come wesley through and he pounded his
[1:28:33] age through see
[1:28:34] a lot of outfalls come from it the other
[1:28:35] church is raising up
[1:28:37] and then here come pentecost pounding
[1:28:38] away and they organized and went right
[1:28:40] back into death again
[1:28:42] as we'll get to it in a few minutes
[1:28:43] right back into death
[1:28:45] and then comes the revelation of the
[1:28:47] mystery to reveal what it's all been
[1:28:49] about
[1:28:51] that's our day then comes the revelation
[1:28:53] mystery to reveal what it's all been
[1:28:55] about where these little doctrines like
[1:28:57] luther brought out catechism and
[1:28:58] everything and wesley brought this that
[1:29:00] and the other
[1:29:00] these other things then pentecost
[1:29:02] brought out organization just the same
[1:29:04] and father son holy ghost baptism and
[1:29:05] things not knowing any different
[1:29:08] then come back in the last days and
[1:29:10] picked up all these mysteries and
[1:29:11] clearly explained it revealed it why
[1:29:14] it's all the last day when this great
[1:29:17] mystery
[1:29:17] that god had in his heart is being
[1:29:20] revealed
[1:29:21] all of that has to be finished all in
[1:29:24] the last day
[1:29:25] all the mysteries revealed all the loose
[1:29:27] ends tied together
[1:29:28] so that this great mystery that god has
[1:29:30] had in his mind
[1:29:31] since before the foundation world so it
[1:29:33] could come now to be revealed
[1:29:37] that's why if i could just explain in my
[1:29:40] with
[1:29:40] from my own heart that's why you know we
[1:29:44] can
[1:29:44] we can labor on doctrines
[1:29:48] but doctrines weren't the point
[1:29:52] i hope you i hope you don't
[1:29:54] misunderstand me because i don't
[1:29:55] belittle anything
[1:29:57] but you had to understand serpency to
[1:29:59] understand the fault to understand
[1:30:00] yourself
[1:30:01] to know why there had to be redemption
[1:30:03] to know who you really are
[1:30:06] see it's all about revealing this
[1:30:08] mystery in the end time without serpent
[1:30:10] seed you couldn't have the mystery of
[1:30:12] god revealed
[1:30:13] you wouldn't know who you are and if you
[1:30:14] don't know who you are you can't know
[1:30:16] who god is
[1:30:17] because you come from god and without
[1:30:20] knowing who you are you cannot have the
[1:30:23] mystery of god
[1:30:24] cannot be finished
[1:30:27] he come to preach godhead because
[1:30:29] without the proper understanding of the
[1:30:30] godhead
[1:30:31] we don't know who god is and if we don't
[1:30:33] know who god is we don't know who we are
[1:30:35] and if we don't know who we are then we
[1:30:37] can never receive the mystery of god
[1:30:39] finished
[1:30:44] so the doctrines have been uh
[1:30:47] such a opportunity for fight and debate
[1:30:50] and strife
[1:30:51] and it's been such an opportunity to
[1:30:54] write books
[1:30:56] and to to to set down
[1:30:59] uh doctrinal beliefs
[1:31:05] but that wasn't the point
[1:31:10] he had to tie together those loose sins
[1:31:12] all those things that were left off in
[1:31:13] the ages they had to be finished up
[1:31:15] so that we we could receive the mystery
[1:31:17] of god we couldn't even receive it
[1:31:19] without understanding these things
[1:31:22] without the teaching of the church ages
[1:31:24] you know what went wrong and how god
[1:31:25] possibly if you didn't know the church
[1:31:28] ages
[1:31:29] you would have no i no concept of being
[1:31:31] able to receive
[1:31:33] luther as an elected of god
[1:31:38] you couldn't have when you heard that he
[1:31:40] smoked a pipe and
[1:31:42] you know called the jews christ haters
[1:31:44] and even conspired
[1:31:46] to have a persecution brought against
[1:31:48] them you can never look at
[1:31:50] luther and the day we live with the what
[1:31:51] we have now you could never look at
[1:31:53] luther and those in his day
[1:31:55] and say that he had the same holy ghost
[1:31:57] you have today
[1:31:59] like brother branham said you never call
[1:32:01] him unlike seed of god
[1:32:02] but you had to understand amen the
[1:32:04] revelation of the seven church ages
[1:32:06] and the revelation of the seven church
[1:32:08] ages would help you understand
[1:32:10] how the body of christ has been growing
[1:32:12] how it was cut down that bride was cut
[1:32:14] down
[1:32:14] it was eaten by all those uh insects
[1:32:17] amen and it went to ruin in the
[1:32:19] entire churches but god has been
[1:32:20] building it back to restore the
[1:32:22] the bride tree
[1:32:26] you see all of these things we can fuss
[1:32:29] on and argue about and
[1:32:31] debate with this church and group and
[1:32:33] with this church group and
[1:32:34] this denomination and that denomination
[1:32:37] but you know
[1:32:38] you can get somebody to agree with you
[1:32:40] that maybe
[1:32:41] it was adultery in the garden of eden
[1:32:43] that caused our ruin
[1:32:47] but that's still not the point
[1:32:51] the point was to catch the mystery of
[1:32:52] god revealed
[1:32:55] the point was to understand
[1:32:58] who god is what his plan was what
[1:33:01] interrupted his plan
[1:33:03] how he's been going about to redeem
[1:33:06] his loss and his plan and who christ
[1:33:09] is who we are in christ
[1:33:13] because without that understanding then
[1:33:16] the mystery of god is not finished to
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:23] so if we want to fight about doctors i
[1:33:26] don't want to fight about doctrines
[1:33:29] the doctrines were to bring me to this
[1:33:32] all that brother venom labored in to
[1:33:34] teach
[1:33:36] the manifestations of the spirit the
[1:33:38] demonstration of the life of christ
[1:33:40] was all to bring me to this the healings
[1:33:44] the miracles the prophecies
[1:33:46] the visitation of angels the the the
[1:33:49] visitation in a cabin
[1:33:51] all of those things were to bring me to
[1:33:53] this
[1:33:56] so that we could see the mystery of god
[1:33:57] revealed
[1:34:03] again he says in christ the mystery god
[1:34:05] revealed
[1:34:06] but all this mystery is revealed only as
[1:34:09] he promised to his bride
[1:34:12] hell is against this truth
[1:34:16] why do you think hell would be against
[1:34:17] this truth
[1:34:20] because when you with open face look in
[1:34:22] a glass
[1:34:24] you're changed into the image you behold
[1:34:28] from glory unto glory and if the devil
[1:34:32] can keep a veil over you or a veil over
[1:34:35] your heart when you listen to the
[1:34:36] messenger read the word
[1:34:38] then he can still maintain his control
[1:34:41] and he can still sit as a squatter on
[1:34:42] this earth
[1:34:43] amen because it's the mystery this is
[1:34:46] the last part to be revealed
[1:34:48] is the mystery of god is to be finished
[1:34:50] and when the mystery of god is
[1:34:52] finished amen and the bride is fully
[1:34:54] assembled and then under the revelation
[1:34:56] then sin's curse is broken amen and he's
[1:34:59] lost all of his
[1:35:00] power so he has to keep the veil in your
[1:35:03] mind he has to keep the veil in your
[1:35:05] heart
[1:35:05] he has to keep the veil over the word
[1:35:07] and he's got to keep us fighting
[1:35:08] about doctrine and fighting about
[1:35:10] brother branham's life and fighting
[1:35:12] about this and fighting about that
[1:35:14] and fighting about holiness and fighting
[1:35:16] about whatever
[1:35:17] amen i'm not interested in fighting
[1:35:18] about any of it because everything was
[1:35:20] to push me and drive me to this
[1:35:22] revelation
[1:35:24] let it drive you to this revelation
[1:35:26] don't get hung up like a pharisee
[1:35:28] don't get hung up like a sadducee on
[1:35:30] whether you know whether this will
[1:35:31] happen in lame whether this will happen
[1:35:33] in
[1:35:33] new heavens and new earth all of that is
[1:35:35] to drive you to this revelation
[1:35:38] and we can start debates over doctrine
[1:35:40] and we can start condemning
[1:35:42] another church and condemning another
[1:35:43] preacher and condemning all these things
[1:35:45] when what's the point the point is to
[1:35:47] get the people amen to the revelation of
[1:35:50] god in this day
[1:35:51] not to see it but to be it amen
[1:35:54] but to manifest it but to live it it's
[1:35:57] got to be a living word in this day
[1:35:59] and if satan can stop this revelation of
[1:36:01] the mystery of god
[1:36:03] finished to be manifest in you and me he
[1:36:06] is one
[1:36:10] that's why the devil will let
[1:36:14] i mean he'll encourage your brother to
[1:36:16] hurt you
[1:36:21] why he's trying to put the veil back
[1:36:22] over your heart
[1:36:26] start contentions and strives
[1:36:29] why if he can just keep you from the
[1:36:32] revelation of this mystery
[1:36:34] you can believe the church ages you can
[1:36:37] accept brother branham as a prophet of
[1:36:38] god
[1:36:40] you could receive him as a seventh
[1:36:41] church age messenger
[1:36:44] but if you don't come to where his life
[1:36:46] lives in you revealing
[1:36:48] the revelation of the mystery of god
[1:36:50] finished in this day
[1:36:52] then satan has defeated the word of god
[1:36:58] so the next time that you feel lured
[1:37:01] into a debate just back out because that
[1:37:03] has nothing to do with what we're here
[1:37:04] for
[1:37:06] i've taken the bait more times than i'd
[1:37:08] like to admit
[1:37:10] and i'm ashamed for and it's done me no
[1:37:12] good
[1:37:14] but what's done me good is to sit down
[1:37:15] and read christ as the mystery of god
[1:37:17] and the weep and to realize
[1:37:18] that god doesn't want to just show me
[1:37:20] something he wants to show the world
[1:37:22] through me something
[1:37:23] he wants to pick up his bride this day
[1:37:26] and he wants to peel the mysteries away
[1:37:28] amen and tie all the loose ends together
[1:37:30] so that she will have the foundation to
[1:37:32] understand
[1:37:33] who she really is who she was intended
[1:37:34] to be how she got in this condition and
[1:37:36] what he's done
[1:37:37] to free her from this condition so that
[1:37:40] he can take the veil off of our heart
[1:37:42] that he can take the veil off of the
[1:37:44] word
[1:37:44] so we with open face can behold him in
[1:37:47] perfection the mystery of god revealed
[1:37:49] and be changed into what we behold from
[1:37:52] glory and to glory
[1:37:53] amen and then there'll be a living amen
[1:37:55] then you don't have to point anybody to
[1:37:57] anything
[1:37:57] you are it you are the mystery of god
[1:38:02] revealed you are the mystery of god
[1:38:04] being finished in this day
[1:38:05] because the mystery of god is christ
[1:38:07] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:38:09] and christ has to have a body and the
[1:38:11] bride is the completed body of jesus
[1:38:14] christ
[1:38:16] and you are here to manifest this
[1:38:19] mystery
[1:38:22] will you be able to explain it probably
[1:38:24] not
[1:38:26] i haven't done a thorough job today but
[1:38:29] yet you get it
[1:38:31] how is that because this is the mystery
[1:38:34] of god
[1:38:36] paul taught it in a mystery but only
[1:38:38] discerned by the spirit
[1:38:41] brother branham taught the mystery only
[1:38:43] discerned by the spirit
[1:38:46] jesus was the mystery
[1:38:50] he was the mystery he was emmanuel
[1:38:54] he was god with us he was god in flesh
[1:38:57] he was the mystery and the mystery was
[1:39:00] being manifest and they were too blind
[1:39:02] to see it
[1:39:04] but did that stop the manifestation did
[1:39:08] that stop the purpose of the
[1:39:09] manifestation
[1:39:10] did that stop the work of redemption
[1:39:13] blindness cannot stop god's work
[1:39:18] now god is working in and through his
[1:39:21] bride
[1:39:22] what's he doing he's revealing the
[1:39:24] mystery
[1:39:26] what mystery the mystery of god that's
[1:39:28] finished in this day
[1:39:30] he's revealing the mystery christ's body
[1:39:33] the last part of his body being put
[1:39:35] together
[1:39:36] to complete the body of jesus christ and
[1:39:39] when the last one comes in then the
[1:39:41] rapture will go
[1:39:42] so here is completing the body of christ
[1:39:45] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:39:46] revealed
[1:39:47] so here we stand as the completed part
[1:39:49] of the body
[1:39:50] revealing the mystery why is all hell
[1:39:54] against this revelation
[1:39:55] because this revelation is destroying
[1:39:59] hell's authority it's destroying
[1:40:03] hell's lies all of the
[1:40:06] mistruths and misconceptions that have
[1:40:08] come through the church ages
[1:40:10] this revelation is dispelling all of it
[1:40:13] and this revelation amen is actually
[1:40:16] going to prevent us from falling into
[1:40:18] the same trap
[1:40:19] our forefathers fell in without this
[1:40:22] revelation you can't help it
[1:40:25] i'll read that brother bam tells us that
[1:40:27] let's let's keep reading
[1:40:30] but all this mystery is revealed only as
[1:40:32] he promised
[1:40:33] to his bride that's why you can't
[1:40:37] explain it friends
[1:40:38] it's only revealed to the bride
[1:40:42] hell is against this truth of the
[1:40:43] revelation of this mystery
[1:40:45] but the bride is standing on it that's
[1:40:48] her
[1:40:48] stand now if you want to stand for
[1:40:51] something
[1:40:51] stand for this well i stand
[1:40:55] for this and i stand for that this is
[1:40:57] the bride stand
[1:40:59] the revelation of this mystery
[1:41:02] why do you hunger church why do you
[1:41:04] thirst it's the father trying to reveal
[1:41:07] this hidden secret to you
[1:41:08] but you let so many things get it out of
[1:41:10] you you let your job you let your wife
[1:41:11] you let your husband
[1:41:12] you let your children you let the cares
[1:41:14] of the world you let some past you let
[1:41:16] somebody else get
[1:41:17] that out of you when you know that way
[1:41:19] down in your heart you're thirsting
[1:41:21] hungry it's god trying to reveal it to
[1:41:23] you see the revelation
[1:41:25] the last day is here
[1:41:29] again in christ the mystery of god
[1:41:30] revealed he says what did they do
[1:41:33] sold out to reasonings of wisdom and
[1:41:34] education like eve did
[1:41:36] fallen angels did wesley was a man of
[1:41:38] god but what followed him
[1:41:40] fallen angels got into it what was the
[1:41:43] angels first
[1:41:44] creative beings of god but fell for
[1:41:46] lucifer's wisdom
[1:41:47] fell for lucifer's wisdom and you see
[1:41:49] what they became
[1:41:51] fallen angels and organizations from men
[1:41:53] of god who has went forth to establish
[1:41:55] truth in the earth
[1:41:56] before that truth could go on and
[1:41:58] proclamate
[1:41:59] and get on to the real revelation of
[1:42:01] christ
[1:42:03] isn't that amazing those men were
[1:42:06] bringing truths
[1:42:09] but those truths were supposed to go on
[1:42:11] and proclamate and bring us to the real
[1:42:12] revelation of christ
[1:42:14] but what happened they cabbage down on
[1:42:16] that truth
[1:42:18] and they didn't get on to the real
[1:42:19] revelation of christ it was
[1:42:21] truth it was right it was god's time it
[1:42:23] was the word for their day
[1:42:24] but those men were supposed to go on and
[1:42:26] those moves are supposed to go on
[1:42:28] to proclamate and bring forth the
[1:42:30] complete mystery of christ
[1:42:34] let me read that again but before the
[1:42:37] truth could go on and proclamate and get
[1:42:39] on the real revelation of christ fallen
[1:42:41] angels came in
[1:42:42] and took it over and made denominations
[1:42:44] out of it
[1:42:45] that's the reason the revelation of the
[1:42:48] seven seal mystery had to be
[1:42:49] unfolded to keep you from doing it
[1:42:54] again
[1:42:56] the seven seal mystery had to be
[1:42:58] unfolded all the mysteries of what's
[1:43:00] happened down through time
[1:43:01] what anointings was was fighting the
[1:43:03] church what anointing was upholding the
[1:43:05] church
[1:43:05] what happened down through time in the
[1:43:07] church they said all the seven seals had
[1:43:09] to be opened
[1:43:10] why because of that cycle has got to
[1:43:13] stop amen
[1:43:14] and it's going to stop by this
[1:43:16] revelation
[1:43:20] now you see it why they left off if
[1:43:22] luther would have went on it had been
[1:43:24] here
[1:43:25] why because luther was elect
[1:43:28] if wesley would have went on if
[1:43:29] pentecost would have went on what would
[1:43:31] they done
[1:43:32] now there is only one thing can happen
[1:43:34] there has to be a message at the end
[1:43:36] time
[1:43:37] when there is nothing else can follow it
[1:43:39] and now the ecumenical world has set up
[1:43:41] such a regime that there can be no
[1:43:43] denomination and do not
[1:43:45] uh not nothing else follow it you're
[1:43:47] either in it or you're not in it the
[1:43:49] fruit is in the top of the tree
[1:43:50] and the light is shining on that
[1:43:52] predestinated fruit and she is ripening
[1:43:54] into christ-like fruit
[1:43:55] bringing forth the same mellowness and
[1:43:57] sweetness
[1:43:58] and the same spirit that he had in him
[1:44:01] i hope you see it
[1:44:05] i'd like to say i hope you see it
[1:44:11] but i hope you don't have to say i saw
[1:44:13] it
[1:44:16] but i hope you see it i hope there's a
[1:44:19] bride under the revelation of this
[1:44:21] ministry
[1:44:22] that is growing into christ-like
[1:44:25] ripeness
[1:44:27] that's the point you can see
[1:44:32] brother branham and you can see the wave
[1:44:35] sheath
[1:44:36] and you can see the ministry of christ
[1:44:38] in him and that prophet
[1:44:39] and you can see him out of the
[1:44:41] scriptures and you can see
[1:44:43] the scriptures fulfilled in him you can
[1:44:44] see all of that
[1:44:46] but all of that was to produce something
[1:44:50] even the ministry of the seventh angel
[1:44:52] was to move us to this
[1:44:54] even the forerunner ministry the
[1:44:56] ministry of malachi 4 was to bring us to
[1:44:58] this
[1:45:01] so that she is ripening into christ like
[1:45:05] fruit
[1:45:06] what was the point of the message to get
[1:45:08] you and i
[1:45:09] to be christ on this earth
[1:45:14] with the same character with the same
[1:45:17] conduct with the same surrender to the
[1:45:19] father
[1:45:19] with his same obedience to the word
[1:45:24] ripening in the christ-like fruit
[1:45:25] bringing forth the same melodiness and
[1:45:27] sweetness
[1:45:28] and the same spirit that he had in him i
[1:45:30] hope you see it
[1:45:32] and i say this morning i hope you see it
[1:45:36] i hope you see it in me i see it in you
[1:45:38] i hope it continues to grow
[1:45:40] to where all it is is the manifestation
[1:45:42] of him
[1:45:44] she's reflecting him he she's the body
[1:45:48] he's the head his intelligence his
[1:45:50] leadership
[1:45:51] his guidance reflected down in the
[1:45:53] manifestation in his body
[1:45:56] his body acting out his mind
[1:46:00] that's the day we live in that's the
[1:46:02] mystery being revealed today
[1:46:05] and the message the rapture brother
[1:46:07] behind says well
[1:46:09] then in wesley's age the works that he
[1:46:11] did testified
[1:46:12] who he was and luther's age on
[1:46:14] reformation why sure it testified
[1:46:16] who he was in the days of the
[1:46:18] pentecostals the restoring back of the
[1:46:20] gifts and
[1:46:20] restoring the restoring of the gifts
[1:46:23] speaking in tongues casting out devils
[1:46:24] and the gifts why
[1:46:25] it testified there was no joke about it
[1:46:28] people said when it first raised up
[1:46:29] i read the books on the history of
[1:46:30] pentecost they said it can't last long
[1:46:32] it'll burn down
[1:46:33] it's still burning why is because you'll
[1:46:36] never put it out
[1:46:37] god said it would be there it's that
[1:46:39] portion of the word
[1:46:40] and no more could you put that out and
[1:46:43] then when the bride is being called
[1:46:45] how are you going to put it out it's the
[1:46:48] revelation
[1:46:49] of the manifestation of the word made
[1:46:51] true and we're living in that day praise
[1:46:54] be to god
[1:46:56] i'm getting ready to read a part of a
[1:46:58] sentence but i want you to pay attention
[1:47:03] we're living in that day praise be to
[1:47:06] god
[1:47:08] the revelation of the mystery of his
[1:47:11] self
[1:47:14] the revelation of the mystery of his
[1:47:17] self
[1:47:19] where is he going to reveal it in you
[1:47:22] and i
[1:47:24] it's the revelation of the mystery of
[1:47:27] his self
[1:47:31] let's go to romans 16.
[1:47:45] romans 16 and verse 25.
[1:47:55] now the hymn that is the power to
[1:47:56] establish you according to my gospel
[1:47:59] and the preaching of jesus christ
[1:48:00] according to the revelation
[1:48:02] of the mystery which was kept secret
[1:48:04] since the world began
[1:48:06] but now is made manifested by the
[1:48:08] scriptures of the prophets according to
[1:48:10] the commandments of the everlasting god
[1:48:12] made known to all nations
[1:48:13] for the obedience of faith to god only
[1:48:16] wise be glory through jesus christ
[1:48:18] forever
[1:48:19] amen this has been a mystery
[1:48:23] this is before the foundation of the
[1:48:24] world but now the mystery is being
[1:48:26] revealed
[1:48:28] not in letter but in spirit
[1:48:34] paul came with the new testament the new
[1:48:37] testament he came to preach
[1:48:38] not in letter for the letter killeth but
[1:48:41] he came to preach it in spirit
[1:48:44] and now is the day at the end of the
[1:48:46] ages
[1:48:47] the last day for the revelation of the
[1:48:50] mystery of god
[1:48:51] to be revealed i'd like to say again
[1:48:54] not in letter but in spirit
[1:48:59] god wants his life living in his bride
[1:49:03] the end time to manifest this great
[1:49:05] mystery
[1:49:11] it says in christ is a mystery god
[1:49:13] revealed he says but the revelation came
[1:49:15] through the blood see
[1:49:16] through jesus christ who is the blood of
[1:49:18] god creative blood in the womb of mary
[1:49:21] and paul knew him by revelation that's
[1:49:24] how we know him today
[1:49:25] is the only the only way you could know
[1:49:28] him
[1:49:28] not say i'm methodist that means nothing
[1:49:30] i'm baptist that means nothing i'm
[1:49:32] catholic that means nothing
[1:49:33] but by the revelation that god has
[1:49:35] revealed the word to you
[1:49:37] he is the word and the word how you know
[1:49:39] it's revealed
[1:49:40] it lives itself and it expresses itself
[1:49:43] through you this is what i want to leave
[1:49:46] with
[1:49:47] this morning how do i know it's revealed
[1:49:52] because that a knife that i now live i
[1:49:55] live
[1:49:56] by the faith of the son of god amen
[1:50:00] i died and i do mortify the deeds of the
[1:50:02] body by the spirit
[1:50:03] it's not me that lives any longer but
[1:50:05] christ that lives in me
[1:50:08] how do i know this mystery and god's
[1:50:09] revealed this mystery to me
[1:50:12] because it lives itself and expresses
[1:50:14] itself through you
[1:50:16] i want a greater expression do you
[1:50:20] then we with open face must be beholding
[1:50:24] in a glass
[1:50:26] the image of the lord we must be changed
[1:50:29] by what we see see
[1:50:33] you will live your revelation let that
[1:50:38] sink in
[1:50:39] you will live your revelation
[1:50:44] and so if we don't like the way we're
[1:50:46] living
[1:50:47] maybe we need to pray for revelation
[1:50:51] because you will manifest what you
[1:50:53] believe
[1:50:55] is that true you will live
[1:50:58] your revelation and the the revelation
[1:51:02] that you have
[1:51:03] will become the manifestation of your
[1:51:06] life
[1:51:07] so that's why when we look at the
[1:51:09] manifestation in our life and we see
[1:51:11] you know what i'm not happy with the
[1:51:12] manifestation of my life
[1:51:14] it's not time to go back to the letter
[1:51:16] of the law it's time to ask for god to
[1:51:18] give you an
[1:51:19] open face an unveiled face an unveiled
[1:51:21] heart to behold him in the glass
[1:51:23] and be changed from the image that i see
[1:51:25] what do we need we need to see him as he
[1:51:27] is today
[1:51:29] we need this great revelation that the
[1:51:31] seventh angel was to come
[1:51:33] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:51:34] angel the mystery of god shall be
[1:51:36] revealed
[1:51:36] we need that revelation we need it with
[1:51:39] open face we don't need a veil on our
[1:51:41] heart a veil on our mind
[1:51:42] we need an open vase to look at it as in
[1:51:44] a glass
[1:51:48] and be changed into the image that we
[1:51:50] see
[1:51:51] when we look at this great mystery
[1:51:53] brother bam said christ
[1:51:55] is the mystery of god revealed when we
[1:51:56] look at the mystery we see christ and
[1:52:02] when we see
[1:52:02] christ we are supposed to be changed
[1:52:06] into what we see until we reflect
[1:52:10] what we're pointed to
[1:52:14] that's why i think we've done a
[1:52:17] disservice
[1:52:19] in the message trying to educate
[1:52:24] trying to fight the baptist
[1:52:27] and to fight the catholics and to prove
[1:52:30] that our doctrines are true
[1:52:33] i think we've done a disservice
[1:52:36] all the doctrines was to make christ
[1:52:39] manifest in you
[1:52:42] and i believe that what god wants in
[1:52:45] this day
[1:52:46] is a living epistle written of christ
[1:52:52] displayed to the world the life of jesus
[1:52:54] christ that's what he died for
[1:52:57] and you in this resurrection in this day
[1:53:00] is his victory
[1:53:02] the church is his victory and the reason
[1:53:05] of his death
[1:53:06] and i say god strip everything else away
[1:53:09] from me
[1:53:10] until all i see is that perfect image of
[1:53:13] you
[1:53:14] that the prophet brought in this day the
[1:53:16] revelation of the seventh seal
[1:53:19] and when i see you the scripture says
[1:53:22] you're looking in a glass what's a glass
[1:53:26] a mirror and when you're looking into
[1:53:29] christ
[1:53:30] somehow it's you become the reflection
[1:53:34] the reflection becomes you and what he
[1:53:37] is
[1:53:37] you are and what you are he is
[1:53:42] that's the purpose of the revelation
[1:53:45] in this day
[1:53:48] [Music]
[1:53:50] let's go to romans 8.
[1:53:56] romans 8. i just want to read a couple
[1:53:59] more scriptures
[1:54:00] will be done romans 8
[1:54:04] and 29.
[1:54:10] for whom he did for know he also did
[1:54:13] predestinate
[1:54:14] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:54:18] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:54:20] many brethren
[1:54:22] what did god want he wanted the
[1:54:25] revelation of this mystery
[1:54:27] in you christ is the mystery of god
[1:54:30] revealed
[1:54:31] under the voice of the seventh angel the
[1:54:32] mystery of god shall be finished
[1:54:35] and god who he foreknew he predestinated
[1:54:39] are you predestinated
[1:54:42] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:54:46] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:54:47] many brethren
[1:54:49] if you're predestinated you're be you're
[1:54:51] predestinated
[1:54:53] to reflect christ you're predestinated
[1:54:57] to be conformed into his image
[1:55:01] let's go to first corinthians 13.
[1:55:13] first corinthians 13 and 8.
[1:55:18] charity never faileth but whether there
[1:55:20] be prophecies
[1:55:21] they shall fail whether it be tongues
[1:55:24] they shall cease
[1:55:25] for there be knowledge it shall vanish
[1:55:27] away for we know in part we prophesy in
[1:55:30] part
[1:55:31] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:55:33] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:55:35] away
[1:55:36] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[1:55:38] understood as a child
[1:55:39] i thought as a child but when i became a
[1:55:42] man
[1:55:42] i put away childish things for now we
[1:55:45] see through a glass darkly but then face
[1:55:47] to face
[1:55:48] now i know in part but then shall i know
[1:55:52] even as also i am known and now abideth
[1:55:55] faith hope and charity these three
[1:55:57] but the greatest of these is charity
[1:56:01] remember we started in second
[1:56:03] corinthians 3 18
[1:56:05] that we with open face or beholding us
[1:56:08] in a glass
[1:56:09] are changed into the image from glory
[1:56:13] unto glory but now it says
[1:56:16] when that which is perfect shall be done
[1:56:17] away when as a child i speak as a child
[1:56:20] verse 12 for now we see through a glass
[1:56:22] darkly
[1:56:24] but then face to face now i know in part
[1:56:27] but then shall i know even as also i am
[1:56:30] known
[1:56:31] brother branham he he refers to this
[1:56:35] scripture
[1:56:36] and questions and answers he said in
[1:56:37] first corinthians 13 says when that
[1:56:39] which is perfect
[1:56:40] is come that which is in part shall be
[1:56:42] done away with
[1:56:43] so all these little things of jumping up
[1:56:45] and down like a kid trying to talk in
[1:56:46] tongues and all these other things
[1:56:48] when that which is perfect and we do
[1:56:50] have today by god's help
[1:56:52] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:56:54] with divine vindication
[1:56:57] then that which is in part is done away
[1:57:02] when i was a child i spake as a child
[1:57:05] i understood as a child but when i
[1:57:06] become a man
[1:57:08] i put away childish things
[1:57:11] see this comes at the end of first
[1:57:13] corinthians 13 which is the love chapter
[1:57:16] charity agape love
[1:57:17] which we know is the capstone when
[1:57:19] brother brennan preached the stature of
[1:57:20] a perfect man
[1:57:21] when he got to the statue of a perfect
[1:57:22] man it was capped off by what
[1:57:24] the capstone which was love
[1:57:28] which is god himself capping off the
[1:57:30] individual
[1:57:32] and when we come to this revelation
[1:57:35] this rev that what we have in this day
[1:57:38] is the perfect interpretation of the
[1:57:40] word with divine vindication
[1:57:43] brother brahma said when the perfect has
[1:57:44] come that which is in part shall be done
[1:57:46] away
[1:57:47] are the partial understandings done away
[1:57:49] when i was a child what would this do
[1:57:50] it brings us to full maturity to bring
[1:57:54] us to the capstone of love
[1:57:56] to a marriage union now everything we do
[1:57:59] is motivated by love
[1:58:03] jesus christ when he come to manifest
[1:58:05] the father he didn't manifest the father
[1:58:07] because he was obligated to
[1:58:08] he didn't manifest the father because he
[1:58:10] was afraid if he didn't he'd be lost
[1:58:13] he didn't manifest the father because he
[1:58:15] was trying to achieve to a goal
[1:58:17] and get to something so that he could
[1:58:19] have the kingdom of david at some time
[1:58:22] no but he had an understanding of who he
[1:58:24] was all the way back when he was 12
[1:58:26] years old
[1:58:27] when mary and joseph come to gather him
[1:58:29] up when he's been left behind
[1:58:30] amen and mary says my father and i
[1:58:33] sought thee with tears he says did you
[1:58:34] not know that i must be about my
[1:58:36] father's business
[1:58:37] what was he doing he was discussing the
[1:58:40] scriptures with the elders
[1:58:42] what was his father's business his
[1:58:43] father's business was the word
[1:58:46] all the way back then he knew who he was
[1:58:48] and jesus was not motivated by fear
[1:58:51] he was not voted by achievement he was
[1:58:52] not motivated by reward
[1:58:55] what was his motivation love
[1:58:59] the father loved him and he loved the
[1:59:02] father
[1:59:03] what did his revelation produce fear
[1:59:06] anxiety nervousness about the future
[1:59:11] what did his revelation produce his
[1:59:13] revelation produced in him a love for
[1:59:15] the
[1:59:16] father that would surrender self to the
[1:59:18] headship of the father
[1:59:21] and god in this day has opened the seals
[1:59:25] he's opened the book he's opened the
[1:59:26] mystery
[1:59:27] so that we could see what so that we
[1:59:29] could see our position
[1:59:30] in christ you hath he quickened up
[1:59:34] you're already quickened and you're
[1:59:36] already seated in heavenly places in
[1:59:37] christ jesus
[1:59:38] you were on the lamb's book of life
[1:59:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:59:41] and written an indelible ink and his
[1:59:43] blood will never be removed
[1:59:46] why did god show you that way why did
[1:59:48] god show us all these things
[1:59:50] so that we wouldn't have to be motivated
[1:59:51] by fear or the letter of the law
[1:59:53] or an achievement system or trying to
[1:59:55] finally get good enough to get something
[1:59:56] from god
[1:59:58] the bride is not worried about trying to
[2:00:00] become bride she's bride because he
[2:00:02] chose her to be bride
[2:00:04] she doesn't have to earn that position
[2:00:06] or try to become the bride
[2:00:07] she's not straining to become bride she
[2:00:10] is
[2:00:10] bride and the revelation god gives
[2:00:13] personally to each one of us
[2:00:14] in our position frees us it brings
[2:00:17] liberty in christ
[2:00:20] i don't have to strain i don't have to
[2:00:23] meet goals
[2:00:24] i don't have to work my way up what do i
[2:00:26] have to do
[2:00:27] i have to take this perfect revelation
[2:00:29] that's given us in this day
[2:00:32] and with open face look at it
[2:00:36] observe it become one with it
[2:00:40] and be changed into the image that i
[2:00:42] behold from glory
[2:00:44] unto glory that's why if we if we don't
[2:00:48] preach the mystery
[2:00:50] amen we're never going to get somebody
[2:00:51] to the manifestation because the
[2:00:54] manifestation
[2:00:55] comes amen from being changed into the
[2:00:58] image that we look at
[2:00:59] and if we don't even see what this great
[2:01:01] mystery was what the seventh seal is
[2:01:03] amen what are we going to be changed
[2:01:04] into we're going to be changed
[2:01:06] amen into forerunner followers
[2:01:11] we're going to be changing the malachi 4
[2:01:13] promoters
[2:01:16] and i promote malachi 4. but you
[2:01:19] understand what i'm saying
[2:01:20] we're going to be changed amen we're not
[2:01:22] going to recognize
[2:01:24] our position because we won't have the
[2:01:25] right image of god
[2:01:27] we won't have the right revelation of
[2:01:29] god that's being finished in our day
[2:01:31] and we can never come into the
[2:01:32] manifestation
[2:01:34] of that revelation until first the veil
[2:01:36] is taken away
[2:01:39] and the message came this day to take
[2:01:41] the veil away
[2:01:42] so that i'm not afraid of not going in
[2:01:44] the rapture
[2:01:45] i have to go in the rapture my name was
[2:01:48] on the last book of life
[2:01:49] he came to me and revealed himself to me
[2:01:51] he doesn't do that to everybody
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:55] i didn't come to him he came to me
[2:01:59] i didn't understand my study he gave me
[2:02:02] eyes to see and revealed it to me
[2:02:05] by a personal revelation
[2:02:08] i i i am here because i was there
[2:02:11] and i'll be there because i was there
[2:02:14] i hope you understand that
[2:02:18] not because i acted right or i did write
[2:02:20] or understood right
[2:02:22] so many people have been manipulated
[2:02:25] into all kinds of positions in this
[2:02:26] message
[2:02:27] because they've been taught that if you
[2:02:28] don't believe this right you can't be
[2:02:30] bride
[2:02:30] or if you're bride you believe this or
[2:02:32] if you don't see this you're serpency
[2:02:36] that's not god how god motivates that's
[2:02:38] not how god taught jesus christ that's
[2:02:40] not how god brought his bride up amen
[2:02:42] brother branham never taught us that way
[2:02:46] of course he said the bride will see
[2:02:47] this absolutely but what does he do
[2:02:49] he takes all the bondage away
[2:02:54] and he shows you seated with him in
[2:02:56] heavenly places
[2:02:59] and when you see yourself already there
[2:03:04] then comes the liberty of the sons of
[2:03:06] god
[2:03:08] see when somebody begins to preach that
[2:03:10] way they're taking away your liberty
[2:03:14] they're making a requirement for you to
[2:03:16] be bride
[2:03:20] but god put no requirement on me the
[2:03:23] only requirement is faith
[2:03:25] and that came by grace and it was a gift
[2:03:31] i didn't try to believe i didn't read
[2:03:33] until i believed and understood
[2:03:35] i didn't go to a bunch of different
[2:03:37] teachers i just
[2:03:38] for some reason believed
[2:03:42] and the longer i looked the more i
[2:03:44] believed
[2:03:45] and when i looked again i believed more
[2:03:47] and i looked again i believe more and
[2:03:49] more and more and more
[2:03:50] and you know what happened as i looked
[2:03:52] more and believed more
[2:03:55] i began to change more
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:03:59] as god plucked me up out of a sinful
[2:04:02] life
[2:04:03] things began to fall away and as it
[2:04:05] began to lift me higher in the
[2:04:06] revelation
[2:04:07] the higher i go more things fall off
[2:04:12] not because i have to give them up
[2:04:16] not because if i don't give them up i
[2:04:17] won't be bribed
[2:04:20] and as god lifts me up the higher you
[2:04:23] get
[2:04:24] the further you can see
[2:04:27] and that's why revelation builds upon
[2:04:29] revelation upon revelation
[2:04:31] because as you go higher all of a sudden
[2:04:33] you can see things you can never see
[2:04:35] down here
[2:04:39] and if somebody is trying to define you
[2:04:42] because you're not
[2:04:43] up here and they're
[2:04:46] taking away your sonship or your
[2:04:49] identity as a bride and part of the
[2:04:52] mystery
[2:04:53] you will never get up here it's
[2:04:56] impossible for you to rise up here
[2:04:58] because you can only come here if you
[2:05:01] know who you are
[2:05:04] not by the letter but by the spirit so
[2:05:06] you end up with a lot of people
[2:05:08] pretending to believe doctrines they
[2:05:09] don't understand
[2:05:11] and learning how to rehearse phrases and
[2:05:14] repeat certain phrases that they don't
[2:05:16] understand
[2:05:18] so that they can be part of the bride
[2:05:23] but that's not what god did for us god
[2:05:26] came and he peeled away the seals
[2:05:28] he showed us what's happened he showed
[2:05:30] us the mystery plan from before the
[2:05:32] foundation of the world all the way to
[2:05:34] new heavens and new earth and when you
[2:05:35] saw it you said that's beautiful amen
[2:05:37] and he come like paul and says you've
[2:05:39] already made it when he made it you made
[2:05:41] it amen he made it for you
[2:05:43] amen you can't be lost you can no more
[2:05:45] be lost than god can be lost
[2:05:48] if you've got god in you you've got zoe
[2:05:50] life eternal life it never started it'll
[2:05:52] never end
[2:05:53] you can never be separated from the love
[2:05:54] of god you can never be lost you can
[2:05:56] never be diminished you can never be
[2:05:58] cast
[2:05:59] out and when it was preached to you that
[2:06:02] way
[2:06:03] you said tell me more show me more i
[2:06:05] want to see more
[2:06:10] we with open face and be holding in the
[2:06:13] glass
[2:06:14] you used to be holding the glass darkly
[2:06:15] but when that which is perfect has come
[2:06:18] that which is in part is done away and
[2:06:20] what we do have by god's grace today
[2:06:24] is the perfect interpretation of the
[2:06:25] word with divine vindication
[2:06:28] i encourage you just to keep looking at
[2:06:30] it
[2:06:32] and keep being changed from what you
[2:06:33] look at and what you look at
[2:06:36] may become you and you keep becoming
[2:06:39] what you look at
[2:06:41] until the two become one
[2:06:46] what's that that's the message of the
[2:06:48] hour
[2:06:50] i hope you understand it because i'm not
[2:06:53] going to be able to explain it
[2:06:56] let's read one more scripture and then
[2:06:58] we'll be done
[2:06:59] musicians you can go ahead and make your
[2:07:01] way up and brother ben as well
[2:07:03] romans 8.
[2:07:06] we're going to go back and read this
[2:07:08] again but i want to continue on
[2:07:15] romans 8 and 29
[2:07:18] for whom he did for no he also did
[2:07:20] predestinate to be conformed
[2:07:22] to the image of his son that he might be
[2:07:24] the firstborn among many brethren
[2:07:27] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[2:07:29] he also called
[2:07:30] and whom he called then he also
[2:07:32] justified and whom he justified
[2:07:34] then he also glorified i want to ask you
[2:07:38] are you trying to get glorified
[2:07:39] or have you already been glorified
[2:07:44] you've been glorified that means
[2:07:47] it's finished friends it's already done
[2:07:52] verse 31 why shall we then say to these
[2:07:54] things if god before us
[2:07:56] who can be against us he that spared not
[2:07:58] his own son but delivered him up for us
[2:08:00] all
[2:08:01] how shall he not with him also freely
[2:08:03] give us all things
[2:08:04] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[2:08:06] god's elect it is god that justifieth
[2:08:09] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[2:08:10] that died yey rather that has risen
[2:08:12] again
[2:08:12] who is even at the right hand of god who
[2:08:14] also maketh intercession for us
[2:08:17] who shall separate us from the love of
[2:08:18] christ shall tribulation
[2:08:20] or distress or persecution or famine or
[2:08:22] nakedness or peril or sword
[2:08:24] as it is written for thy sake we are
[2:08:26] killed all the day long
[2:08:27] we are counted as sheep for the
[2:08:29] slaughter nay in
[2:08:31] all these things we are more than
[2:08:32] conquerors through him that loved us
[2:08:34] for i am persuaded that neither death
[2:08:36] nor life
[2:08:37] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[2:08:40] nor things present
[2:08:41] nor things to come nor high nor
[2:08:44] death nor any other creature shall be
[2:08:46] able to separate us from the love of god
[2:08:48] which is in christ jesus
[2:08:50] our lord if you're
[2:08:53] that secure can you be at rest
[2:08:58] if you're that secure are you in there
[2:09:00] under any pressure
[2:09:02] if you're under that secure god has done
[2:09:04] all of that for you
[2:09:06] because of his love can you not just
[2:09:09] love him back
[2:09:11] that's all he wants god doesn't want
[2:09:14] your
[2:09:15] deeds as righteousness they're filthy
[2:09:17] rags
[2:09:19] he has showed you his great love now all
[2:09:21] he wants is somebody that'll love him
[2:09:23] back
[2:09:24] and when you love him back you'll have
[2:09:26] the same attitude
[2:09:28] same surrender same obedience as jesus
[2:09:31] christ did when he loved his father back
[2:09:34] the father loved him he loved the father
[2:09:36] back
[2:09:37] christ has loved us and we love him back
[2:09:40] that's what he wants in this day let's
[2:09:43] all stand
[2:09:45] praise be to god what a day we live in
[2:09:48] friends
[2:09:51] i say let's keep looking at that image
[2:09:54] let's keep looking at that glass and ask
[2:09:57] god to keep revealing more to us that we
[2:09:59] might seem unveiled more
[2:10:01] and seem unveiled more and see who he is
[2:10:03] more that we can be
[2:10:04] changed from glory unto glory
[2:10:08] by what we behold let's bow our heads
[2:10:11] and pray
[2:10:13] lord jesus we thank you for this day
[2:10:14] you've given us upon the earth
[2:10:17] god for the privilege of hearing these
[2:10:19] things
[2:10:21] lord many wise men many prophets of old
[2:10:23] have longed to see this day
[2:10:26] but lord it's our privilege it's our
[2:10:29] opportunity it's our calling
[2:10:32] god so many men who have gone on before
[2:10:35] and lived their portion of the word
[2:10:36] faithfully
[2:10:37] they've paved the way for us to come and
[2:10:40] god you have so
[2:10:42] showed us your plan you have so revealed
[2:10:44] the mysteries
[2:10:46] you showed declared yourself in us and
[2:10:48] we see you lord
[2:10:50] unveiled before us what was the purpose
[2:10:53] of you unveiling yourself before us
[2:10:56] so that we can behold you and be changed
[2:10:59] into the image that we see
[2:11:02] god there's not a one of us that can do
[2:11:03] this ourselves
[2:11:05] there's not a one of us that can be good
[2:11:07] enough lord
[2:11:08] that can conquer the flesh all by
[2:11:10] ourselves but lord through the spirit
[2:11:13] we do mortify the deeds of the body let
[2:11:16] your spirit live in us lord
[2:11:18] there's anyone here lord who's not
[2:11:20] received your spirit i pray god that
[2:11:21] they would just open their heart now
[2:11:24] and say lord just come to me lord i
[2:11:26] receive you in the fullness of your word

[2:11:40] predestinated seed to life
[2:11:43] may that life begin to live out from
[2:11:45] each of these vessels lord
[2:11:47] till it wouldn't be us anymore it
[2:11:49] wouldn't be the life that i live
[2:11:50] now but it'd be the life of christ
[2:11:54] living in me god we love you we thank
[2:11:57] you for the picture you've painted in
[2:11:58] this day

[2:12:02] true interpretation of the word that we
[2:12:05] might see you as you are and by seeing
[2:12:07] you we can be changed into your image
