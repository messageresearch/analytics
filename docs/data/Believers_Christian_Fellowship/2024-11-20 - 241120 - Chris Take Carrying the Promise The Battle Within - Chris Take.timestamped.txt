[17:24] God bless you sir man some familiar
[17:26] faces here amen I'd like to speak
[17:29] tonight on carrying the promise and I
[17:32] want to take a reading here from in my
[17:35] subtitle is the battle within so I'd
[17:38] like to take the reading here from 1st
[17:40] Samuel 18 verse 5- 16 and forgive me I
[17:45] might have to take a few drinks tonight
[17:47] um the devil's been attacking my
[17:51] throat and in preparation for this week
[17:54] so we're just relying on the Lord
[17:57] because when when the devil gets nervous
[18:00] I get
[18:02] excited
[18:04] amen 1st Samuel 18 verse
[18:10] 5-6 we're going to pick up here kind of
[18:13] in the middle of the story of David and
[18:16] David went out withs soever Saul sent
[18:18] him and behaved himself wisely and Saul
[18:22] set him over the men of war and he was
[18:24] accepted in the sight of all the people
[18:26] and also in the sight of Saul's servants
[18:29] and it came to pass as they came when
[18:31] David was returned from the slaughter of
[18:33] the Philistine that the women came out
[18:35] of all the cities of Israel singing and
[18:37] dancing to meet King Saul with tabrets
[18:40] with joy and with instruments of music
[18:42] and the women answered one another as
[18:44] they played and said Saul hath slain his
[18:46] thousands and David his 10 thousands and
[18:50] Saul was very wroth and the saying
[18:52] displeased him and he said they have
[18:55] ascribed unto David 10 thousands and to
[18:57] me they have ascribed
[18:59] but thousands what can he have more but
[19:02] the kingdom and sa I David from that day
[19:06] forward this is kind of the beginning
[19:08] and Saul was already in the dissension
[19:11] from um being rejected of the Lord but
[19:13] now the problems began to manifest
[19:16] themselves within his uh his cabinet or
[19:20] his his uh Kingdom and it came to pass
[19:23] on the tomorrow that the evil spirit
[19:26] from God Came Upon Saul and he
[19:27] prophesied in the midst of the house and
[19:29] David played with his hand as at other
[19:32] times and there was a javelin in Saul's
[19:34] hand and Saul cast the javelin for he
[19:36] said I will Smite David even to the wall
[19:38] with it and David avoided out of his
[19:41] presence twice and Saul was afraid of
[19:43] David because the Lord was with him and
[19:45] was departed from
[19:47] Saul therefore Saul removed him from him
[19:50] and made him his captain over a thousand
[19:52] and he went out and came in before the
[19:54] people and David behaved himself wisely
[19:56] in all his ways and the Lord was with
[19:58] him wherefore when Saul saw that he
[20:01] behaved himself very wisely he was
[20:03] afraid of him but all Israel and Judah
[20:05] loved David because he went out and came
[20:08] in before them let's just bow our heads
[20:10] tonight Lord Jesus we ask you to come
[20:13] and speak to us Lord may we just relax
[20:15] in your presence tonight and father just
[20:18] pull up our chairs and Tuck our feet
[20:20] under the table Lord Jesus and feast on
[20:22] your word Lord may may there be no
[20:24] insertion of a man's opinion but just
[20:27] everything from straight from your word
[20:29] Lord Jesus and father we know to begin
[20:31] with you said it's the foolishness of
[20:33] preaching but you gave a promise father
[20:35] that this the five-fold ministry was for
[20:38] the edifying of the body of Christ that
[20:40] Lord it is for the Perfection and what
[20:42] Lord we're looking for that perfection
[20:44] in our lives Lord Jesus I pray you just
[20:46] come tonight and speak to our hearts
[20:48] Lord may you move aside the veil of our
[20:50] of our own selves that we could see
[20:52] inside of us Lord and father may you
[20:54] just draw us nearer to you tonight we
[20:56] love you Lord and we thank you for all
[20:58] these things things in Jesus name we
[20:59] pray amen you can be
[21:02] seated amen praise the Lord so thank you
[21:06] brother Chad you were making me
[21:08] nervous I appreciate his policy of
[21:10] sitting in the
[21:13] congregation
[21:14] amen so you
[21:18] know David here is is uh in a unique
[21:22] position and you can go through and and
[21:26] and you know maybe this is a good
[21:29] homework for the rest of the week but go
[21:31] back and read the whole story of David
[21:34] and you know in history I'm not I'm not
[21:37] exactly a um a historian or or know all
[21:41] the history but history in general when
[21:44] you have something like this happened in
[21:45] the Kingdom either David kills Saul and
[21:49] takes over or Saul kills David and
[21:52] that's the end of it and um there's a an
[21:55] uprising in his kingdom yet but David
[21:58] was protected of God so Saul could never
[22:00] get his hands on him and David had the
[22:04] utmost respect for the fact that Saul
[22:06] was God's anointed king that he never
[22:09] moved his hand against him so they
[22:11] played this cat and mouse game for
[22:13] several years um in this time and and
[22:16] you would think that at some point Saul
[22:18] would would give up and and you know
[22:20] manage his kingdom uh like he should but
[22:23] he would go to war and then as soon as
[22:24] the war was done he would go back to
[22:27] hunting David down and try try to catch
[22:28] him and so if if you think about just a
[22:31] very unique uh situation but at the same
[22:35] time for for David I mean absolute
[22:38] torent
[22:40] torment I mean you you think you have
[22:42] trials um I don't think we're being
[22:44] hunted by the king that's right
[22:46] everywhere we go and you you have to
[22:48] remember that
[22:50] that in once Israel enters this uh
[22:54] position of having Kings um this is this
[22:58] is this is uh the Pastoral ship of
[23:00] Israel all through the books of 1 and 2
[23:03] Samuel and through the book of kings and
[23:05] so I I don't want you to think of who is
[23:10] Saul you can laugh I want you to think I
[23:13] wanted to put yourself in the position
[23:15] of David so we're not here to point and
[23:18] say that person is is this bad person in
[23:21] this story we're here to say this is me
[23:25] this is where I'm at or or this is the
[23:27] position that I'm in
[23:28] and Lord give me the strength and give
[23:31] me the courage to carry out what you
[23:33] have put forth in my life and it's to be
[23:36] an encouragement and
[23:38] so our title again tonight is carrying
[23:41] the promise and talking about the Battle
[23:44] within and so we can all go directly to
[23:47] to think about Mary right Mary was
[23:49] carrying the promised child within her
[23:52] and each of us are carrying a promise as
[23:54] well a promise of of the word and and
[23:58] there there's one goal you have to
[24:00] remember that the whole thing is about
[24:02] Redemption and Redemption is about
[24:05] buying back what was always
[24:09] his
[24:12] so
[24:14] sometimes we we come to these battles
[24:17] like
[24:18] David we have the
[24:21] promise but there was something in Job
[24:24] that God wanted to see further perfected
[24:27] and there's many things in you and I
[24:29] that God wants to see further perfected
[24:31] but the whole time we're carrying the
[24:35] promise the whole time David was
[24:37] carrying the promise the prophet Samuel
[24:40] had found him and anointed him king
[24:43] that's right long before he was ever in
[24:45] the courts of
[24:46] Saul and so David no doubt many times
[24:50] thought he was he was now moving into
[24:52] this position and Saul was going to
[24:54] recognize that he was a much better
[24:56] choice than his own son and and and
[24:58] Elevate him through the courts and and
[25:00] make him the king yet instead of that
[25:03] from from very the very beginning pretty
[25:06] much Saul finds a bitterness in his
[25:08] heart towards
[25:10] David but the whole time David was
[25:13] carrying this promise that he was the
[25:15] anointed king yeah
[25:17] so during this time of David's life
[25:20] there was a great battle within
[25:23] himself and you and I every day of our
[25:25] life there was a great battle within
[25:27] ourselves
[25:29] there's a great war and and and many
[25:31] times it puts on the face of but God you
[25:35] said Lord you said Lord you promised and
[25:38] it puts on that face not the Battle of
[25:40] trying to be a good Christian but the
[25:42] Battle of trying to to to hold to the
[25:45] promise the Battle of of holding to the
[25:49] standard that he has placed in your life
[25:52] he has called us all to something and it
[25:55] may look different for each one of us
[25:57] but we have all been called to an
[25:58] ultimate thing which is to reveal Christ
[26:02] to this world he has veiled himself in
[26:05] you and I we are the word made flesh for
[26:07] this generation so you are carrying the
[26:11] promise you have Christ within you and
[26:13] God wants to manifest himself through
[26:15] you that's right but there's the flesh
[26:18] that's so there's a great battle within
[26:21] that's right and let's jump forward to
[26:24] first uh Samuel 27
[26:29] 1st Samuel
[26:33] 27 and we're going to read verse 1 to
[26:41] 7 and David said in his heart I shall
[26:43] now perish One Day by the hand of Saul
[26:47] there is nothing better for me than than
[26:49] that I should speedily Escape into the
[26:51] land of the Philistines and Saul shall
[26:54] despair of me to seek me anymore in any
[26:56] coast of Israel so shall I escape ese
[26:58] out of his hand and David arose and he
[27:01] passed over with the 600 men that were
[27:03] with him into unto Ashish the son of
[27:06] mayo king of gath and David dwelt with
[27:09] Ashish at gath he and his men every man
[27:11] with his household even David with his
[27:13] two wives Ain the jezus and Abigail the
[27:17] caritis nabal's wife and it was told
[27:20] Saul that David was fled to gath and he
[27:22] sought no more again for him and David
[27:25] said unto Ashish if I have now found
[27:27] Grace in Thine Eyes let them give me a
[27:29] place in some town in the country that I
[27:31] may dwell there for why should thy
[27:32] servant dwell in the Royal City with
[27:34] thee then Ashish gave him ziklag that
[27:37] day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the
[27:40] kings of Judah unto this day and the
[27:42] time that David dwelt in the country of
[27:44] the Philistines was a full year and four
[27:47] months so you know I I I'm in studying
[27:50] this out and and and and the inspiration
[27:53] you know one day was one thing and then
[27:56] the inspiration the next day was was not
[27:58] there and then and then it returned with
[28:00] vengeance and and so I really don't have
[28:03] much of an idea of the overall direction
[28:06] this is is going to go tonight but but
[28:08] I'm just leaning on the Lord because
[28:11] um he's all I care
[28:14] about and what he wants so you have to
[28:17] remember now if you were in the Kingdom
[28:19] of Saul I want you to put on your you
[28:21] know your imagination um kids you're
[28:24] right there with me adults maybe it's
[28:25] been a while but put on your your imagin
[28:28] ation and think about if you were part
[28:30] of of the Kingdom of Israel and Saul was
[28:32] your king and you didn't personally
[28:35] personally know David who would you
[28:39] believe you would probably believe
[28:41] Saul because there there's there's parts
[28:45] of the scriptures when they have to go
[28:46] and they free uh they rescue their their
[28:49] their wives and their children from
[28:51] ziklag when it's taken over by the
[28:53] amalekites and it says there was Men of
[28:55] bile with David that said we don't want
[28:56] to share the spoils with those who
[28:58] stayed behind so they weren't all good
[29:00] guys it was a it was a group of people
[29:03] who who didn't fit in and and some of
[29:04] them were it's old debts and they were
[29:06] running from their debts so it was it
[29:08] was this I mean first of all you're Saul
[29:11] and you're a pastor of a kingdom Imagine
[29:13] David being a pastor of that group of
[29:16] men and so if you were in the Kingdom of
[29:19] Saul though you look and you say well we
[29:23] we thought David was was great we
[29:26] thought David was great he he did all
[29:28] this and and he you know he was going
[29:30] out and he was coming in and so each of
[29:32] them were probably fighting with well
[29:33] what's the truth because now Saul our
[29:35] King is is trying to kill David and and
[29:38] then he's the he's their pastor and and
[29:40] we don't really know David and now David
[29:42] has all of these men surrounding him so
[29:45] what do I believe and there was probably
[29:47] some a lot of discussions around the
[29:49] dinner table and a lot of heated
[29:51] discussions when there was fellowships
[29:53] and and and different things and people
[29:55] were you know trying not to gossip and
[29:57] try not to talk about but there was also
[29:59] turmoil within the kingdom and then
[30:01] comes the news that David went to the
[30:06] Philistines you see Not only
[30:11] was Not only was was God perfecting
[30:14] things in
[30:15] David but God was changing something
[30:18] about
[30:20] Israel you see where did they start with
[30:22] they said we don't want God we want a
[30:25] man so now they have a man who's Fel who
[30:29] has failed them
[30:31] tremendously who isn't a king has lost
[30:34] his mind has literally got
[30:35] insane acts out of fear and rage and has
[30:38] these the the these moments where he's
[30:40] possessed of an evil spirit and now we
[30:43] have David who we all loved and I'm sure
[30:45] everyone talked about hey you know
[30:47] you're going to be the next king he's
[30:48] going to be the next king and you know
[30:49] word probably spread around cuz all of
[30:51] his other brothers were there when
[30:52] Samuel anointed David and and and
[30:55] Jonathan said you're going to be the
[30:56] king and I'll be a right-hand man and
[30:58] and so but then David Goes to the
[31:00] Philistines so now Israel has what are
[31:03] they going to do who who who so God's
[31:06] trying to to tell them look you got to
[31:08] stop trusting in the men got to stop
[31:10] trusting in the man so you trusted in
[31:12] Saul and he failed you I picked him
[31:15] because I knew you would like
[31:17] him to teach you a
[31:20] lesson that this isn't what you want and
[31:24] then I brought David and you thought you
[31:25] found your another man the next man man
[31:28] this is the man this is the man people
[31:30] do that they go to church to church this
[31:31] is the pastor this is the pastor and
[31:33] they will do that for the rest of their
[31:35] lives until they realize it's not the
[31:37] pastor so they realize that it's God to
[31:39] be Christ and and God will show them
[31:42] things and give them glimpse into things
[31:44] about the pastor that maybe you wouldn't
[31:45] even know because your eyes are on
[31:47] Christ so it doesn't matter but they see
[31:49] all the problems so their eyes aren't on
[31:52] Christ and so they go to the next king
[31:56] So now David is the Phil
[31:58] that's right and word
[32:02] spread and so it says even here that
[32:05] that in in 1st Samuel 28 the next
[32:07] chapter that David was ready to go fight
[32:09] with King Ashish you know he was bit of
[32:11] a turmoil but he was going to go with
[32:13] with the Philistines I don't know he was
[32:16] he was probably so
[32:18] discouraged he probably thought
[32:22] well I'll just go and try not to kill
[32:26] too many of them
[32:30] you have to remember David was a man he
[32:33] was a man after God's Own Heart but he
[32:35] was still a man I'm a
[32:38] man I make
[32:40] mistakes and so do
[32:43] you so here's David and and there's this
[32:46] battle within there's this battle within
[32:49] and I want to read this quote
[32:52] here it's in why little Bethlehem it
[32:54] says poor David and his mind all
[32:57] confused he thought how can it be Lord
[33:00] you know leaders sometimes go through
[33:01] things that the congregation don't know
[33:03] what they're going through when you
[33:05] think of promises God has
[33:08] made then why don't it come to pass they
[33:11] don't tell their congregation they don't
[33:13] tell the people they associate with but
[33:16] there's many frustrations in the heart
[33:18] of a real
[33:20] leader it's a bit of a reading but I I
[33:23] just I cut it where I could and I I had
[33:25] to read most of it he says David sitting
[33:28] there his throat burning him it was in
[33:30] the middle of summer so David is is up
[33:32] there in the caves of adah I think is
[33:35] what it was and correct me if I'm wrong
[33:37] but and he says he says we'll just kind
[33:40] of read through this he says talk about
[33:42] a time of confusion just about like it
[33:45] is
[33:46] now he says David taken refuge in this
[33:49] little place in this little shelter
[33:51] everywhere he could get to the little
[33:53] strongholds that he could hold into then
[33:55] he got up on the mountain on that hot
[33:57] middle of the summer when the heat was
[33:59] tremendous his throat parching and
[34:00] fluster and fears in his heart and
[34:03] wondering oh God how could it be you
[34:06] poured that oil upon me not because I
[34:08] chose myself but you chose me why did
[34:11] you call me from hurting the Sheep out
[34:13] yonder and told me you give me this to
[34:17] serve your people and here you've got me
[34:19] between the fires everywhere brother
[34:22] says that was going through his
[34:24] heart are you thankful for the eyes of a
[34:26] prophet that was going through his heart
[34:29] and and and and I really encourage you
[34:30] to go listen to him preach this this is
[34:33] a couple of years after 1956 when he
[34:36] preached the
[34:37] indictment you can hear it in his voice
[34:41] he is burdened in his heart doors are
[34:44] starting to close things are starting to
[34:45] shift he doesn't know what's going to
[34:47] happen to him so he's in himself he's
[34:50] there with David standing on the on the
[34:53] Cliff's Edge looking down to the chaos
[34:56] around him and many times you and I are
[34:58] in the same exact position we're
[35:01] standing there saying Lord I don't
[35:03] understand that's
[35:05] right because you're carrying the
[35:08] promise you understand you're carrying
[35:11] the Promise by God's grace we're going
[35:13] to show you it has to be this way it has
[35:16] to be that way there has to be a battle
[35:19] within you must be
[35:21] perfected and he'll do it in your life
[35:24] between the
[35:25] fires he sat up on the Hill and he
[35:28] looked down and there the Philistines
[35:29] had come in and garrisoned right in
[35:32] Bethlehem his little home then his
[35:34] little city was under government control
[35:36] of the enemy not only that but his own
[35:38] Father's House Jesse's house was under
[35:40] bondage to the Philistines you know I
[35:43] don't I don't know the type there but
[35:44] his father's house was in
[35:48] bondage there was his own Nation his own
[35:51] church against him he had spent all
[35:55] those years serving them and they had
[35:57] turned on
[35:58] him he had spent all those years coming
[36:01] in and going out and and fighting the
[36:03] Philistines and and and and doing all of
[36:05] the things that that that a a a good you
[36:08] know soldier of the king should do and
[36:11] and and everything matched up and
[36:12] everything was right yet he's in this
[36:16] position why what what about him did
[36:19] Saul
[36:20] hate the fact that he was carrying the
[36:24] promise why is your life the way it is
[36:26] because the devil knows you're carrying
[36:28] the promise and he'll anoint men who are
[36:31] called of God to get under your
[36:34] skin Saul was God's anointed Saul went
[36:38] to be with
[36:40] Samuel God used him to get under David's
[36:44] skin God used him to perfect David and
[36:47] God does the same thing to you because
[36:48] you're carrying the
[36:50] promise you have been anointed you have
[36:54] been anointed to sit on his throne
[36:58] but there's a battle
[36:59] within there's a great battle within and
[37:02] sometimes this is how it manifests in
[37:05] your
[37:06] life there was his own Nation his own
[37:08] church against him here was the enemy he
[37:11] was fighting here is the church people
[37:14] he was fighting not because he wanted to
[37:16] but because he was forced to do it many
[37:20] times we're forced to do things and say
[37:22] things that we don't want to say a real
[37:24] spiritual leader but he's forced to do
[37:26] it I mean you're reading the quote with
[37:29] me he has to take his side and show his
[37:32] colors I'll take the way with the Lord's
[37:34] dispised
[37:35] few I was telling
[37:38] uh Brother David here the other night
[37:40] that I'm I'm
[37:42] anti-ad when I see the majority doing
[37:44] something I get very
[37:46] concerned we had this we had this war in
[37:49] Ukraine manifesting and and all of the
[37:51] sudden I started seeing all these cute
[37:52] little signs blue and yellow support
[37:56] Ukraine support Ukraine and then they
[37:58] were there NE and I'm not going to get
[37:59] into politics I'm just making a point
[38:01] they were there next to the pride flag
[38:02] and I thought I'm
[38:04] concerned and then you talk to people
[38:06] who know what's going on and you realize
[38:08] why you're concerned things aren't
[38:09] always as they appear so whenever I see
[38:12] a majority doing something I'm
[38:16] skeptical and the Lord is the same
[38:19] way it's the despised few right I mean
[38:24] you think about it the the Israelite or
[38:27] the
[38:27] the disciples with Jesus I mean this was
[38:30] the
[38:31] Messiah they had all this this following
[38:34] you know 70 other disciples if I have my
[38:38] math right and and all these signs and
[38:40] these wonders and he feeds 5,000 and
[38:42] then they follow him across the sea and
[38:44] they said hey do it again we're hungry
[38:46] you know and and totally missing the
[38:48] point and so then God says Jesus says
[38:51] hey well unless you drink my blood or
[38:54] eat my flesh and everybody of the church
[38:58] turn their backs on the
[39:01] word God is calling again I'm not here
[39:04] to say who's Saul we're not doing that
[39:06] that's up to God God is calling a bride
[39:08] from a
[39:10] church right because the bride of Christ
[39:13] is carrying the promise and you have to
[39:17] be called spiritually maybe even
[39:19] physically to the caves of caves of
[39:22] Abdullah to inti the deserts of inti to
[39:26] to the stronghold holds of of the
[39:29] Wilderness while the rest of the church
[39:32] looks on and says you really have lost
[39:34] it but you see David knew where he stood
[39:37] on the word you see God will put you
[39:40] things and I'm and I and I I brother
[39:43] Chad understands this other the
[39:44] ministers here understand this You
[39:45] Preach where you're living I'm preaching
[39:47] What I'm Living God under God knows that
[39:51] there's certain things you have to
[39:52] endure certain things that that need to
[39:54] be taken from you that that you have to
[39:56] be perfected and the only way you can do
[39:59] he can do that is when he puts you
[40:01] between the fires when he puts you in a
[40:04] place where where we're even even in
[40:06] doing the right thing there's
[40:09] opposition and and and there's suspicion
[40:12] sometimes and and and and all of these
[40:14] kind of things and and um but the lord
[40:19] always has a
[40:20] plan the lord always has a
[40:23] plan
[40:25] so he says here was David standing back
[40:28] here not knowing what to do yet knowing
[40:31] that on him rested the
[40:35] anointing God put you through things
[40:38] through
[40:40] hardships in such a way where you're
[40:43] ready to then
[40:45] say am I
[40:48] right am I am I am I my standard right
[40:53] and where do you take it as a mature Son
[40:55] of God you don't take it to that Pastor
[40:57] or that Pastor or that brother you go
[41:01] back to the
[41:03] word you see there there's things in our
[41:06] life sometimes we don't have right and
[41:09] there's opposition because God wants us
[41:11] to fix those things but all you will
[41:14] become is a parrot of men if you don't
[41:18] go back to the word every single
[41:22] time if you're going to stand for a
[41:25] standard it's got to be the standard of
[41:27] the word and then you know you know you
[41:31] see why could David endure what he
[41:33] endured cuz he
[41:35] knew he
[41:38] knew he knew who he was he knew what his
[41:41] calling was he knew the promise he had a
[41:45] revelation of his destination he had a
[41:48] revelation of who he was and what he was
[41:51] supposed to do and when the opposition
[41:53] rose up against him he didn't cave to it
[41:58] because he had something to stand on and
[42:02] if what you're standing on is not
[42:04] Revelation and opposition Rises up you
[42:08] will
[42:10] cave so your foundation must be the
[42:14] rock which is a revelation of who Jesus
[42:18] Christ is to you
[42:20] personally that's why that's so so
[42:23] important but God will God will
[42:25] challenge your position
[42:27] he will use things to challenge your
[42:29] position and he will go beyond the
[42:33] workplace and right into the
[42:36] church right into the the message
[42:38] Community he will come right in and do
[42:41] something to get under your
[42:43] skin and if you're like me you'll get in
[42:45] the flesh then God will correct
[42:48] you and next time you you'll get more in
[42:52] the spirit and a little less In the
[42:53] Flesh and God will correct you
[42:57] because if if your heart is in the place
[42:59] where you say God no matter what I want
[43:02] to be right on your word I want to be
[43:06] right in your will which his word is his
[43:12] will see yet knowing that on him rested
[43:16] the anointing now his Warriors they knew
[43:19] that anointing was there they knew David
[43:22] was going to be king so they could stand
[43:25] with David the Warriors could stand with
[43:26] d David cuz they knew it was the truth
[43:30] see remember David types Christ The
[43:32] Warriors you and I we can stand with
[43:35] Christ because we know he's the anointed
[43:37] one we know he is the one who has it all
[43:41] in
[43:42] control and all we have to do is learn
[43:45] to follow him better every
[43:48] day he says look through that spiritual
[43:52] sight Yonder that he's coming King I'll
[43:54] serve him if it's death let me die if
[43:58] it's my family it's my loved ones if
[44:00] it's my
[44:01] denomination it's everything let me
[44:03] serve him I'll stay to him that's the
[44:05] Warriors of God like was with David they
[44:08] had their hands on their sword walking
[44:12] anytime that's the way God's Warriors
[44:14] walk
[44:15] ready they had to are you kidding me
[44:19] David had the Philistines and
[44:22] Saul hunting them down
[44:25] constantly cuz you have to remember Saul
[44:27] lost a big battle to the Philistines and
[44:29] they came in and took over a large
[44:30] portion of Israel so they were there in
[44:33] the land and David is sitting there
[44:35] saying why are the Philistines walking
[44:39] on our
[44:40] promise why won't somebody rise up and
[44:43] do something and he fought when he could
[44:45] and he went out and he did things but it
[44:47] was it was underneath the leadership of
[44:49] the King Saul Saul was the one who had
[44:52] to rise up and do something about it you
[44:55] see God has a plan God has a for format
[44:57] to things and and many times he will put
[44:59] you in the position where you're looking
[45:01] to the leader saying I want you to do
[45:03] something why won't you do
[45:07] something but it was in Saul's hands and
[45:10] all David could do was wait on the
[45:13] Lord all he could do was wait on the
[45:17] Lord so his Warriors they had to walk
[45:21] ready so David was a fugitive right he
[45:24] was a fugitive
[45:27] and
[45:29] um there was there's somebody else he
[45:33] says that's a long ways up there and our
[45:36] church it's here so I can do that I
[45:38] ain't going to work here he says he
[45:40] which he's talking about Christ was
[45:42] represented in both David and warriors
[45:45] because he was the king and he was the
[45:52] warrior who came and broke through the
[45:55] enemy's lines
[45:57] conquer death Hell In The
[45:59] Grave
[46:03] amen so
[46:05] now he says in this is in 1963 now while
[46:09] same Sermon Just couple few years later
[46:12] and David trying to get back to his own
[46:15] home and could not do it because the
[46:18] Philistines were Garris around
[46:19] garrisoned around Bethlehem and it was
[46:22] and and excuse me and David trying to
[46:24] get back to his own home could not do it
[46:26] was out in the wilderness because he had
[46:28] become a fugitive to the people or there
[46:32] was ousted he says what a beautiful
[46:34] picture that is of Christ today a
[46:37] fugitive he is he says now you say that
[46:39] can't be well if you believe the Bible
[46:41] it is the Bible said in the leoan church
[46:44] age that Christ was on the outside of
[46:45] the church knocking trying to get back
[46:48] in his own church trying to get back in
[46:52] his own church so we looked at David and
[46:55] and and we
[46:57] David is going through this situation
[46:59] and we're going to we're going to leave
[47:01] David hanging in the wilderness for
[47:03] right the next few
[47:05] minutes
[47:07] because he was a shadow a type of
[47:10] Christ and you and I are the
[47:14] bride say Amen you can believe it at
[47:17] least hopefully as you said amen in your
[47:19] head if you didn't say it out loud but
[47:21] you got to believe it don't don't be
[47:22] worried that maybe you're not the bride
[47:24] you got to believe it you got to take
[47:25] hold of it and and say I'm the bride I'm
[47:28] the bride you know don't get don't get
[47:30] arrogant about it make sure you're
[47:32] living the word of God but say you're
[47:33] the
[47:35] bride and Christ is manifesting himself
[47:39] through the
[47:40] bride okay I we're going to bring this
[47:43] try to bring this down to where we are
[47:46] today so what is what is God doing in
[47:49] the day and age that we live in right
[47:50] now he's calling you he's calling us
[47:54] higher he's calling us out of the church
[47:58] if you're the bride of Christ he's
[47:59] calling you out of the church not the
[48:02] building the
[48:06] system the ideas of
[48:09] man he says now you see this is I know
[48:12] this is stuff you know but he says now
[48:15] you see it's wheat time now it's getting
[48:16] Harvest Time this is not Luther's age
[48:18] this is not Pentecost age this is the
[48:20] bride age as Moses called a nation out
[48:23] of a Nation Christ today is calling a
[48:25] church or a bride out of a church you
[48:28] see the same thing in type taking them
[48:31] to the Glorious Eternal promised
[48:35] land
[48:37] now we uh um Elisha is a a type of the
[48:41] Bride
[48:42] right I'm really going to need your help
[48:45] here you don't have to be vocal I'm not
[48:48] not begging you but just just stay with
[48:49] me here Elisha is the type of the bride
[48:52] God is so we have David he's in stuck in
[48:56] the wilderness right now we need to get
[48:58] back to him so you got to come with me
[49:00] so David is a type of Christ stuck in
[49:02] the wilderness so Christ is also a
[49:04] fugitive in the day and age that we live
[49:05] in outside of the Leo to seea Knocking
[49:09] calling you and I out of the church and
[49:13] we are a type or Elisha was a type of
[49:16] the bride and there's a scripture says
[49:18] in in First Kings 19:19 so he departed
[49:21] then and found Elisha the son of Chaat
[49:24] who was plowing with 12 yolk of ox and
[49:26] before him and he with the 12 and Elijah
[49:29] passed by him and cast his mantle upon
[49:32] him now the number 12 you know there's a
[49:35] lot of things and and you probably have
[49:37] have heard it I don't have it all
[49:38] figured out but brother bam says 12 is
[49:41] the doctrine of the 12 apostles it was
[49:44] it was the transition between the law
[49:46] cuz the woman with the 12 stars in
[49:48] Revelations 12 was standing upon the law
[49:50] and it was it was Christ coming it was
[49:52] it was the introduction of the
[49:54] dispensation of Grace so here is Elisha
[49:57] and he's plowing with the doctrine of
[50:00] the Apostles and he's plowing very
[50:02] straight roads but AB branam said
[50:04] several places that's why God chose him
[50:07] because he would plow straight roads and
[50:08] not look behind him and he was plowing a
[50:11] team of 12 oxin y'all ever done
[50:16] that this was no small thing 12 oxen
[50:22] what do they weigh like 1,200 lb a piece
[50:24] controlling them back and forth I mean I
[50:27] couldn't even draw Furrow a a straight
[50:30] row in a
[50:32] tractor and he's holding on to 12 oxen
[50:35] but he said but this is this is the
[50:37] plowing straight rows with the doctrine
[50:39] of the 12 apostles so this is the
[50:42] ministry that issued in the seven Church
[50:44] ages this is the word that come forth so
[50:48] why why can't we just leave Elisha in
[50:50] the field he's plowing according to the
[50:54] word for the B says the 12 the do of the
[50:56] apost Apostles was what brought through
[50:58] the revelation of the Holy Ghost so he's
[51:00] plowing with the word of God he's
[51:01] plowing straight roads he is the church
[51:05] but God is calling him from something
[51:07] into something
[51:10] else so Elisha is about to become a
[51:13] fugitive he has a home he has a field
[51:16] everything's going fine and all of a
[51:17] sudden Elijah walks by and throws his
[51:20] mantle on him in other words he tosses
[51:23] the word at Elisha he doesn't say a
[51:28] thing I guess there was silence in
[51:30] heaven for the space of half an hour he
[51:32] doesn't say a thing he just tosses the
[51:34] word to Elisha and Elisha says wow this
[51:38] isn't enough here and what does he do he
[51:41] sacrifices his past he slays his past
[51:45] and he feeds the people and he says I'm
[51:47] going to follow you and he follows
[51:48] Elijah for I think it's like 3 years
[51:51] Elijah does some prophecies and does
[51:53] some things and and and then but but
[51:55] then he goes he goes further than that
[51:58] so so he's just following Elijah I don't
[52:00] know I don't know I got he's got the
[52:02] word he knows the truth and Elijah said
[52:06] hey follow me and and Elisha says all
[52:10] right where are we
[52:12] going and we go there and we go there
[52:15] and we go there and there's a prophecy
[52:16] given and there's the prophecy come to
[52:18] pass you know it's the ministry of
[52:20] Elijah and then Elisha turns to him in
[52:24] gilgal and he says
[52:27] I need to go to bethl you should stay
[52:31] here God always challenges your faith he
[52:34] he sees your faith and so he tests it
[52:37] that's right he says well you really
[52:39] believe
[52:41] me well you go also Jesus said turn to
[52:44] the disciples will you go also that is
[52:46] not what we say when our church splits
[52:49] we don't look to the rest of that are
[52:50] there and say will you leave too we as a
[52:53] man we say please please don't go
[52:55] anywhere
[52:58] but he he he looks and says well you go
[52:59] also because he knows who he is he is
[53:01] supreme authority underneath Supreme
[53:06] control and if you are the word made
[53:08] flesh
[53:09] today brother says you have all the
[53:12] power you need within you all you do is
[53:15] lack the faith to activate it so you
[53:18] don't need more
[53:20] power you need more faith you need more
[53:23] revelation of who you are amen David had
[53:28] access to a power Israel could not
[53:32] understand David had access to something
[53:36] King Ashish could not understand David
[53:40] had access to something bayah his mighty
[53:42] warrior could not
[53:45] understand David had Faith Abraham had
[53:50] access to something Sarah for a while
[53:53] did not understand Abraham had access
[53:56] this is something lot did not understand
[54:00] because he had
[54:01] faith and because he had Faith he was
[54:04] unlocking the mystery in his life you
[54:07] want to know who you
[54:10] are you want to know who you
[54:13] are Faith cometh by hearing the word of
[54:16] God Revelation you see you don't go get
[54:20] Faith Faith finds you my wife and I we I
[54:23] I have a I have a truck an old truck and
[54:26] uh it's a it's a holds a special part in
[54:28] in my heart cuz I like old trucks and
[54:30] it's a but it's got 260,000 Mi on it we
[54:35] took it camping and it and it bit the
[54:36] dust and whole truck started to shake as
[54:39] we were parking the trailer back in our
[54:40] yard and and uh the engine started to
[54:43] knock and I had had a fuel leak and lost
[54:45] oil pressure and 270,000 mil on it it's
[54:49] 32 years old and so I talked to our
[54:53] mechanic friend there at the church and
[54:54] he said your engine's toast
[54:57] um and I had shut it off and I pushed it
[54:59] back into its parking spot you know I
[55:01] didn't even start it again I just okay
[55:03] well figure out what we're going to do
[55:04] with that and you know as time goes on I
[55:07] I really needed the truck I needed it I
[55:10] I I had work to do and things to get
[55:11] done and and I and I just was I was
[55:13] driving back to my house one day and I
[55:16] thought you know the Lord just kind of
[55:18] spoke to my heart and said why don't you
[55:19] pray for it and I thought Lord I've done
[55:21] that before and I was just I was just
[55:24] this is where God wants he wants you to
[55:26] be honest amen you know I I believe the
[55:29] access to Faith is through humility I
[55:31] said Lord I don't have enough faith for
[55:33] that I don't have enough faith for that
[55:36] you're going to have to show me because
[55:38] there there was a time in my life where
[55:40] where I had and I'll come back where I
[55:42] had a lot of allergies to foods and I I
[55:46] wait I I waited on God I I just
[55:49] committed myself to to just eating what
[55:51] I could eat and which was very little
[55:53] and I just put it on God's hands and
[55:54] then he called me to prayer and he
[55:57] healed me instantly so I said Lord you
[55:59] did it like that I'm not going to try to
[56:01] work something up I'm not going to try
[56:02] to make this up if you want if this is
[56:05] your will if this is you I don't have
[56:06] enough faith for it and I got home and
[56:09] my wife she looks at me she goes you
[56:11] know maybe we ought to just pray for the
[56:22] truck and uh so I said well you know
[56:26] funny you should mention
[56:28] that so we both went outside together
[56:31] and and and I'm serious saying to God I
[56:33] I had no
[56:34] expectations and I thought Lord just you
[56:37] know won't hurt but if you want to fix
[56:40] it you got to give me Revelation that
[56:43] you can fix it you've got to give me the
[56:46] faith that you can fix it give me
[56:48] something and what does God do he gives
[56:50] us his
[56:51] word not emotions not not another man's
[56:55] testimony he gives gives us his
[56:57] word and so arm in arm we both laid
[57:01] hands on the truck and began to pray and
[57:03] I felt awfully silly but all of a sudden
[57:06] something struck me and I realized I
[57:09] said Lord this is a man-made object but
[57:12] every element that makes it up you spoke
[57:14] into
[57:16] existence so every element that is in
[57:19] this truck is the literal spoken word of
[57:21] God you can fix it my wife and I talked
[57:24] later afterwards we both felt something
[57:26] move through our arms I climbed in the
[57:29] truck and it started with no
[57:32] problems and it's still running without
[57:35] any
[57:37] problems see God calls you he's going to
[57:40] give you the faith for
[57:42] it he God go you need something in your
[57:45] life you need to lean on God and say God
[57:46] I need you I need you to show me David's
[57:50] leaning on God he says God I I'm
[57:52] carrying the promise but there's a
[57:54] battle within I have a need but there's
[57:56] a battle within Lord I I'm carrying the
[57:58] promise you promis it in your word but
[58:01] but there's a disconnect in my heart
[58:02] between what you said and what I
[58:04] actually
[58:06] believe but God is faithful to give you
[58:08] the
[58:09] Revelation you can't grab Revelation by
[58:11] yourself God has to give it to you and
[58:14] do you know why he gives it to you
[58:16] because before the foundation of the
[58:17] world you were in his V you the
[58:21] foundation of the world you're in his
[58:22] thoughts you see that's the only way
[58:24] eternity
[58:27] that's the only way time can access
[58:28] eternity is you have to have a part of
[58:31] Eternity within
[58:32] you sir cu the two don't go
[58:36] together so Elisha is following Elisha
[58:41] Elijah and he then says in the hand of
[58:44] the Lord came upon him he says look
[58:46] perfectly type of the church look when
[58:48] they started the first journey was when
[58:50] they come out of the Dark Ages in
[58:51] Luther's age the second stage of the
[58:54] journey the school of the prophets was
[58:56] John Wesley's age a second great Revival
[58:58] the third stage at Jordan was the
[59:00] Pentecostal age now then the next stage
[59:04] is across
[59:05] Jordan when the supernatural takes place
[59:08] here we are entering into
[59:11] that so here's what the journey looked
[59:13] like they Journey from gilgal to bethl
[59:17] was Luther's age
[59:20] justification bethl to Jericho Wesley's
[59:23] age sanctification and each time
[59:26] at the close of the age there was a word
[59:30] you can stay that's right that's right
[59:34] the end of each age there's a challenge
[59:38] you can stay there's a place for you to
[59:42] stay it's a denomination which is just a
[59:45] man's
[59:46] idea each time there was a place for
[59:48] Elisha to stop and stay and he said I
[59:52] got to follow you that's right then it
[59:55] was Jericho to the east of Jordan they
[59:58] cross over Jordan the east of Jordan
[1:00:01] Pentecostal age the Holy Ghost the east
[1:00:04] of Jordan is the land of Gilead Gilead
[1:00:07] was given to originally half the tribe
[1:00:10] of Manasseh you had half the tribe of
[1:00:11] Manasseh and then two other tribes I
[1:00:13] don't remember them at the moment and
[1:00:15] then it just became to be known as the
[1:00:17] land of Gilead it kind of spread out and
[1:00:20] and Israel you know just it's just
[1:00:22] Gilead kind of like you know we we live
[1:00:23] in where we live he just say well a
[1:00:26] Treasure Valley but it's boisey and
[1:00:27] Nampa and all these
[1:00:29] things and so the land of Gilead I like
[1:00:32] to call it we're a little bit on my
[1:00:34] opinion I like to call it the land of
[1:00:36] redemption you say well it's east of
[1:00:39] Jordan well it's the land where you
[1:00:41] receive the revelation of redemption
[1:00:43] because as soon as you realize
[1:00:44] Redemption you'll find your feet in
[1:00:47] Jordan the priests had a step for her
[1:00:50] they had to have a revelation of
[1:00:51] redemption to put their feet into the
[1:00:53] water of the River Jordan they knew this
[1:00:56] promise was theirs what is your promise
[1:00:58] your
[1:00:58] Redemption and so the land of Gilead is
[1:01:01] the land where where uh Jacob wrestled
[1:01:04] with the
[1:01:04] angel the the river Jabbok it says he
[1:01:07] crossed the river Jabbok at the there's
[1:01:09] a a Ford a for or Ford there and he
[1:01:12] wrestles with with with with with laan
[1:01:15] Excuse me with the angel it's also where
[1:01:17] he separates where Jacob separates from
[1:01:20] laan Jacob received his revelation of
[1:01:24] redemption in his life
[1:01:26] he walked different see the lay of the
[1:01:28] land was different back
[1:01:30] then but he still received this
[1:01:32] revelation of his
[1:01:34] Redemption and it's also the birthplace
[1:01:37] of
[1:01:37] Elijah Elijah was born east of Jordan so
[1:01:41] Elijah has to go back to where he was
[1:01:44] born on the east of Jordan and it's
[1:01:47] there he tells Elisha he says if you
[1:01:50] watch me
[1:01:51] go you will receive a what is it twofold
[1:01:56] tenfold whatever double portion thank
[1:01:57] you you'll receive a double portion so
[1:02:01] I'm not going to get too crazy here but
[1:02:03] brother Brandon went to the west and
[1:02:05] then he came back to where he was from
[1:02:07] in the East and he opened the
[1:02:09] book or the Lord opened the book so now
[1:02:13] Elisha holds the book so Elisha was fine
[1:02:15] plowing the fields with the doctrine of
[1:02:18] the twel Apostles which is the New
[1:02:20] Testament but it says it's the
[1:02:21] foundation it's the New Testament the
[1:02:24] foundation but
[1:02:27] the Lord had something even more special
[1:02:29] for Elisha because it was time for
[1:02:31] Elisha to move from Leo toia into the
[1:02:35] bride age to move up higher see it
[1:02:38] wasn't a new word it was the opening of
[1:02:42] the word so Elisha is standing there he
[1:02:46] receives the
[1:02:48] mantle and now he goes from Gilead to
[1:02:52] the west of Jordan into his Eternal
[1:02:57] promise you see you rapturing Faith lays
[1:03:00] within the word so you are already
[1:03:02] feeding on the Eternal promise
[1:03:05] word as you feed on it what did Enoch do
[1:03:08] he fed on it and he fed on it and he fed
[1:03:11] on it until it completely changed his
[1:03:15] position you and I have the desire to
[1:03:18] attain to our position so as we feed on
[1:03:20] the word our position begins to change
[1:03:24] and begin to move into this place
[1:03:26] move up higher and
[1:03:29] higher and now it's Christ in flesh
[1:03:32] again in your
[1:03:36] life and there's the scripture in
[1:03:38] Revelations see brother said God chose
[1:03:41] Elisha because he would plow straight
[1:03:43] Rose and he wouldn't look behind
[1:03:46] him
[1:03:49] and he in Revelations there's the the
[1:03:51] the thing of the three unclean spirits
[1:03:53] like frogs but M says that's that's the
[1:03:55] of the Trinity looking back looking back
[1:03:59] you see Elisha comes across and you just
[1:04:01] hang on a second we'll come back to
[1:04:02] David Elisha comes across the back
[1:04:04] across River Jordan into the open book
[1:04:06] into the revealed word for his hour he's
[1:04:09] not going to go back plowing his Fields
[1:04:11] with 12 oxs and first of all he burned
[1:04:13] that
[1:04:14] bridge he burned that bridge behind him
[1:04:16] he left it I mean he he he gave himself
[1:04:19] no options of returning to that God
[1:04:21] wants to see you totally completely
[1:04:24] committed to following the word burn it
[1:04:28] all behind you that's right what is it
[1:04:31] burn the ship is that what they say burn
[1:04:33] it all behind you don't look
[1:04:36] back so Elisha goes forward in the word
[1:04:40] he takes the word in his hand i'm don't
[1:04:43] get ahead of myself 1 Corinthians 16 or
[1:04:46] 13:1 says when I was a child and we're
[1:04:48] going to turn a corner here so you just
[1:04:50] hang on when I was a child I spake as a
[1:04:52] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:04:53] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:04:56] away childish
[1:04:58] things okay let's go back to David he's
[1:05:00] been waiting there in the wilderness for
[1:05:02] us we're
[1:05:04] back we're back to David we're back to
[1:05:06] you carrying the promise and the battle
[1:05:09] within
[1:05:13] Am David is up there reminiscing and
[1:05:16] like I said you go back and listen to
[1:05:17] this and you can just hear it in his
[1:05:18] voice this is stirring something inside
[1:05:21] of him this is this is where he was
[1:05:23] right then he says he he's saying David
[1:05:26] is is looking back to where he he's
[1:05:29] remembering his life and he says I
[1:05:31] remember when I sang his Praises in my
[1:05:33] childhood days when I heard in my sheep
[1:05:36] oh God take me back to that place take
[1:05:39] me back to my first love take me back
[1:05:41] and give me back my shepherd's staff
[1:05:43] give me back my herd of sheep let me
[1:05:45] alone back there to worship you don't
[1:05:47] read ahead he says I want to go back
[1:05:51] he's hurt he's broken the the the the
[1:05:54] responsibility of car bearing the
[1:05:56] promise is so great upon him the
[1:05:58] reproach is so great he'd rather go back
[1:06:02] right to his days of plowing the fields
[1:06:05] he'd rather go back to just the staff
[1:06:07] and the sheep and and and so what's
[1:06:10] compelling him to return is
[1:06:13] fear what's compelling him to return is
[1:06:16] unbelief what compelling him to return
[1:06:19] is discouragement in his life the word
[1:06:22] never said go back to being a shepherd
[1:06:24] of sheep the word said you're the
[1:06:26] anointed king but David's saying I don't
[1:06:29] see any manifestations of that promise
[1:06:31] in my life right now I do not see that I
[1:06:35] do not understand how you can do that so
[1:06:38] God take me
[1:06:40] back sometimes the fear of the unknown
[1:06:42] in front of
[1:06:43] us pushes us to go back to what's
[1:06:46] familiar but God says Don't Look Back it
[1:06:51] is vile in his sight to look back it is
[1:06:55] the mouth of the false prophet it is the
[1:06:57] mouth of the Dragon in other words it's
[1:06:59] Antichrist to look back says Don't Look
[1:07:02] Back take the ver of you Mir off cuz if
[1:07:05] you look back you're looking to the
[1:07:06] Antichrist and you'll crash Amen in your
[1:07:10] life and your Doctrine in your church
[1:07:13] don't look back but David in his
[1:07:15] discouragement says can't I just go
[1:07:21] back but let's not forget he's carrying
[1:07:25] the the
[1:07:27] promise so now the very thing that
[1:07:30] becomes that has become his burden is
[1:07:33] the very thing that's going to resurrect
[1:07:37] him from the pit it's the very thing
[1:07:40] that's going to lift him from his
[1:07:44] discouragement that sometimes we think
[1:07:46] that but we're in the heat of the battle
[1:07:49] something has got to be done we were
[1:07:51] boys once we're grownup men now the
[1:07:54] fight is on
[1:07:56] I remember when the saus boiled up on
[1:07:58] the floor and the people screamed and
[1:07:59] shouted and you couldn't get around the
[1:08:01] place nowhere here for people but it's
[1:08:03] not that way today he says the battle is
[1:08:07] on it's not William brandham the little
[1:08:09] boy preacher anymore you got to produce
[1:08:14] something David you have to produce
[1:08:18] something it's not good enough that you
[1:08:20] were a shepherd and that you did it
[1:08:21] really good and you SL slayed the bear
[1:08:24] and you slayed the lion that's good but
[1:08:26] that's not enough you need to produce
[1:08:28] something in your life there's got to be
[1:08:31] something
[1:08:33] different this time the time is on the
[1:08:36] battle is on the heat is on the time to
[1:08:40] be delivered the people Everyone is
[1:08:41] found written in the book now the time
[1:08:44] has
[1:08:46] come David is in his discouragement is
[1:08:49] trying to go back but something Rises up
[1:08:52] within David the very thing he's
[1:08:54] carrying that's causing discouragement
[1:08:56] Rises up within him and he says
[1:08:59] but you see he probably knew the story
[1:09:02] of Job And he says but I know my
[1:09:04] redeemer liveth but I know that one day
[1:09:07] I shall see God in this flesh though it
[1:09:09] be
[1:09:10] destroyed amen one day you will see
[1:09:14] God not when you die not when you
[1:09:16] Rapture but right now you have a promise
[1:09:20] of the word given to you calling you up
[1:09:22] saying you can do it you can do it
[1:09:26] cuz you're carrying the
[1:09:30] promise he says he's basically saying I
[1:09:33] didn't don't care about this if my name
[1:09:34] is scandalized they kick me in the
[1:09:36] streets that doesn't matter your desire
[1:09:39] is my command he says that's the real
[1:09:45] Soldier amen that's the real
[1:09:49] Soldier see Elisha
[1:09:52] saw Elijah go up
[1:09:56] and he took the word you see David said
[1:10:01] the his Warriors had to have their hands
[1:10:05] on the sword at all
[1:10:09] times there's a battle
[1:10:11] within because you're carrying the
[1:10:14] promise there's there there's a turmoil
[1:10:17] in the Kingdom because you're carrying
[1:10:19] the
[1:10:20] promise but David
[1:10:22] literally prophesied the demise of Saul
[1:10:25] when he said either he'll he
[1:10:28] will die
[1:10:30] of the I can't remember what he says but
[1:10:33] he'll die of his enemies is what he said
[1:10:35] there's two other
[1:10:36] options so he was waiting he was saying
[1:10:38] God you got to deal with it so now what
[1:10:41] in your life is is the Saul not not
[1:10:44] who what what in your life is Saul so
[1:10:48] your pride is it is it is
[1:10:51] it I can't think of
[1:10:54] anything but there's things in our life
[1:10:56] that are SOL there there there's you see
[1:10:58] even if there's a person it's not who
[1:11:02] it's what cuz you wrestle not against
[1:11:05] the against flesh but against the
[1:11:07] principalities and the powers of the
[1:11:10] air when you're faced with opposition
[1:11:14] and you know the standard is according
[1:11:15] to the word of God you look and you
[1:11:17] check you says yep there's a lion that's
[1:11:19] that's our standard or where you check
[1:11:21] says there's the ox that's our standard
[1:11:23] right Israel's hey everyone go to their
[1:11:25] standard all the Israelites looking
[1:11:27] around for the standard there's the ox
[1:11:28] all right that's where they went cuz
[1:11:30] they were they were of that
[1:11:32] standard ifraim or whoever it was right
[1:11:35] so you you find your standard your
[1:11:37] standard's the word now you can have the
[1:11:39] faith to carry the
[1:11:40] promise but it's because you're carrying
[1:11:43] the
[1:11:44] promise it's because you're carrying the
[1:11:46] promise that there is a battle
[1:11:50] within but that battle
[1:11:52] within I love the word of God it never
[1:11:56] ends so you might be discouraged because
[1:12:00] you're carrying the promise but it's a
[1:12:02] promise that will make you un
[1:12:04] undiscouraged
[1:12:06] encouraged and then you're carrying the
[1:12:09] promise so there's a battle
[1:12:11] within and it's that battle then that
[1:12:13] makes you more like the
[1:12:15] promise yes sir you need the battle
[1:12:19] that's right David needed the battle you
[1:12:21] need to fight within and sometimes
[1:12:23] sometimes sometimes you're
[1:12:26] standing you're standing in the
[1:12:29] wilderness you're standing at the caves
[1:12:32] and there's the Philistines and there's
[1:12:33] the
[1:12:36] church and you're saying I don't
[1:12:38] understand and you can get
[1:12:44] discouraged but I say to you where is
[1:12:46] the Lord God of Elijah and when he had
[1:12:49] also had spit the waters they parted
[1:12:50] hither and thither and Elisha went over
[1:12:55] a hold of your
[1:12:58] promise you're carrying it
[1:13:01] anyway it's with you anyways lay a hold
[1:13:05] of
[1:13:05] it amen praise the Lord let's bow our
[1:13:09] heads Heavenly Father Lord

[1:13:23] pray that tonight the word that was

[1:13:33] encouragement tonight Lord Jesus father

[1:13:44] Lord you have given us a promise and
[1:13:47] father we want to carry that we want to
[1:13:51] carry that with the character of David

[1:14:18] is is now upon our shoulders but thank

[1:14:51] saying 1% better every day
[1:14:56] and uh I believe for a Christian that's
[1:14:59] 1% more surrendered to Christ every day
[1:15:03] every day look for that thing that you

[1:15:07] vengeance amen God bless

[1:16:53] it's the promise with within that's
[1:16:55] causing my flesh all this
[1:16:57] trouble but it's the promise within
[1:16:59] that's going to overcome My
[1:17:01] Flesh amen praise God it was the promise
[1:17:05] in Christ that caused all of the
[1:17:07] conflict but it was the promise in
[1:17:09] Christ that brought the overcoming
[1:17:11] resurrection
[1:17:12] power amen the Press is on because of
[1:17:15] what's inside and so the outside may
[1:17:17] have to get torn down a little bit and
[1:17:20] break way so what's inside can take its
[1:17:22] place amen where's the problem coming
[1:17:25] from from the anointing cuz the prophet
[1:17:28] anointed us he poured the oil over us
[1:17:30] and called us bride that caused all of
[1:17:32] our problems what's the solution to all
[1:17:35] my problems because he poured the oil on
[1:17:37] us and called us bride and anointed us
[1:17:39] to be the bride amen oh it was so good I
[1:17:44] say God help us to burn The Oxen and
[1:17:47] just follow the word help us to have
[1:17:49] confidence in what's been put in our
[1:17:51] hand as Elijah went up he dropped that
[1:17:53] mantle amen which is a sign of his
[1:17:55] office amen and she's going to eat the
[1:17:57] book and prophesy again let's trust
[1:18:00] what's been put in our hands it'll
[1:18:02] overcome friends amen we feel weak we
[1:18:05] feel uncapable that's a good place to
[1:18:07] feel in the
[1:18:08] flesh but inside that thing will
[1:18:12] overcome amen God help us to keep
[1:18:15] pressing forward I loved what he said
[1:18:17] about the frogs they look back amen he
[1:18:21] who putteth his hand to the plow and
[1:18:23] even turth to look back is not worth of
[1:18:25] the higher God's always forward God's
[1:18:28] always
[1:18:29] higher amen help us to go forward and
[1:18:32] help us to go higher you know where
[1:18:34] we're going to find Victory
[1:18:37] forward amen but it's scary it's unknown
[1:18:41] it's risky it's problematic but it's the
[1:18:44] only way to Victory the only way out of
[1:18:47] our problem is forward never
[1:18:50] backwards if David would have stayed
[1:18:52] tending his father's sheep he might have
[1:18:54] had pretty simple basic life but he
[1:18:58] would have never fulfilled the promise
[1:18:59] in his life amen if Peter would have
[1:19:03] kept just
[1:19:04] fishing he may have had half the trouble
[1:19:06] that he had he probably wouldn't have
[1:19:07] been crucified hanging upside
[1:19:09] down but he would have never fulfilled
[1:19:12] the promise that was in his life if we
[1:19:14] would have just stayed simple lives and
[1:19:16] like the rest of the world we probably
[1:19:17] wouldn't have as much problems as we've
[1:19:19] had but we would have never fulfilled
[1:19:21] the promise that's in our
[1:19:22] lives right amen help us to go forward
[1:19:26] God help us to go forward I was
[1:19:29] encouraged by the reality of the sermon
[1:19:32] by the the truth is always real brother
[1:19:34] B said you can't paint Christianity like
[1:19:37] all your problems go away and
[1:19:38] everything's fine no problems start when
[1:19:41] you sign up with Christ amen I love the
[1:19:44] reality of the sermon I appreciate our
[1:19:47] brother I appreciate his humility and
[1:19:48] his honesty his

[1:20:55] we we know certainly there'll be
[1:20:57] difficulties rejections maybe more

[1:21:17] Revelation so that we have confidence in
[1:21:19] who we are and what you've called us to
[1:21:22] and that we have the confidence Lord
[1:21:23] that you would remove every obstacle
[1:21:25] that you would move everything out of
[1:21:26] the way so that your word can come into
[1:21:30] manifestation oh we get discouraged sure
[1:21:32] we get uncertain of what's going to
[1:21:34] happen next we feel a little bit beat
[1:21:36] down and maybe wore out but oh God it
