[0:00] if this seed will only flourish under
[0:02] the light of the age
[0:04] but I continually keep it from the light
[0:07] of the age
[0:08] and keep giving it to Satan's light of
[0:10] the age
[0:11] from the fourth dimension
[0:14] then I'm going to stunt the girls we're
[0:16] not going to get any more potentials out
[0:18] of it
[0:19] it doesn't change the plant
[0:22] it doesn't change the fact it's a Son of
[0:24] God it doesn't change that the
[0:26] potentials are there but you can't
[0:28] you're out of the channel you can't
[0:30] produce the life
[0:32] so we're feeding on entertainment to the
[0:34] world and feeding on things of the world
[0:35] and wrong relationships and wrong
[0:37] conversations and we're not staying
[0:40] under
[0:42] the right atmosphere in the right
[0:43] Channel and then we're wondering why
[0:45] we're struggling to overcome so we're
[0:47] going to try harder but but the trying
[0:49] harder is not going to work
[0:51] can anybody testify trying harder
[0:53] doesn't work
[0:54] praise God I'm glad I'm not all by
[0:55] myself
[0:56] because I tried harder and harder and
[0:58] then harder and harder and harder
[1:00] and the harder I tried the worse I fell
[1:05] so then so then having the the getting
[1:09] out of the channel will stop the growth
[1:12] will stop amen producing the potentials
[1:15] but will not change the plant
[1:22] that's why when you got discouraged and
[1:26] you backslid you never changed that you
[1:28] were a son of God
[1:30] and you may not have been producing any
[1:31] fruit and all of the leaves might have
[1:33] been falling off and your limbs might
[1:35] have been wilting down but in the root
[1:37] you were still Son of God and you
[1:39] couldn't change it because you didn't
[1:40] start it
[1:42] you didn't decide it you didn't choose
[1:44] it it was predestinated in the mind of
[1:46] God before the foundation of the world
[1:48] and you may be dried up and wilted and
[1:51] all your leaves laying down the fruits
[1:52] long gone the bark starting to come off
[1:54] but it doesn't change what you are and
[1:57] if you will just get in the fresh water
[1:59] of the word and under this bright August
[2:01] sunlight amen you'll find that the
[2:03] health will come back to the plant it'll
[2:05] spring back up again the limbs will
[2:07] raise up it'll put forth leaves buds
[2:09] flowers and then fruits
[2:12] but you're not going to do it in the
[2:14] wrong Channel trying to I'll get better
[2:17] and then come back
[2:21] you can't do it
[2:24] amen amen
[2:26] but the seed inside has all the
[2:30] potential to be everything he
[2:32] predestinated it to be
[2:35] so what do I do stay in the channel
