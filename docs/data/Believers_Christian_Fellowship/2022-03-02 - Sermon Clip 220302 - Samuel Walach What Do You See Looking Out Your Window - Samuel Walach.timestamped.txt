[0:00] there is a vision given to us that you
[0:03] are part of that preview of that
[0:05] spotless
[0:07] lam's wife
[0:09] and i believe there is also a price that
[0:11] you need to pay
[0:13] it doesn't come cheap the the first
[0:15] coming of pr of christ didn't come cheap
[0:18] there was a price that had to be paid
[0:20] and that was the price of
[0:22] of of the life of the innocent lamb of
[0:25] god that had to be paid
[0:27] whatever god does it's not cheap god is
[0:30] not cheap because he is rich
[0:32] he's rich in in everything in the
[0:35] resources in everything so that's why
[0:37] when he came there wasn't a cheap visit
[0:41] amen he came down and it was expensive
[0:44] he had to pay the price that's why the
[0:46] second coming
[0:48] is is no different
[0:50] there is a prize that we need to pay as
[0:52] joseph did for the dream of the word the
[0:55] word was shown to him showed him his
[0:59] position and then he had to go through
[1:01] different things in life that brought
[1:03] him
[1:04] straight to the palace amen to his
[1:07] position praise the lord so people get
[1:10] offended brothers of joseph they got
[1:12] offended they didn't get offended
[1:17] by the word you know they all believed
[1:19] the word they believed abraham they
[1:21] believed isaac they believed jacob they
[1:23] believed all of these things so they
[1:26] believed the logos
[1:28] but when the logos started to pull
[1:30] pour itself out into an a vessel
[1:34] that's where the problem arose
[1:37] so it's not the logos that gets people
[1:39] offended is the keynotes it's the
[1:42] pouring out of god emptying
[1:45] of god into human flesh that's where the
[1:48] problem arises
[1:49] and and we can see that that when the
[1:52] word comes in flesh that's where
[1:54] problems start
[1:56] when the word was with god there was no
[1:58] problem
[1:59] when
[2:00] when uh you know god was in the
[2:02] beginning with his own thoughts that was
[2:04] not a problem the problem was
[2:08] when he started to come in flesh
[2:10] amen when he started to manifest himself
[2:14] when the word came into fruition that
[2:16] was the problem
