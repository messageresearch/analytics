[0:00] jesus said if you are to receive it this
[0:04] is that elijah who was for to come
[0:08] if you want to receive it if you are
[0:11] designed if you are mandators to receive
[0:13] it
[0:15] if you are one of those for whom this
[0:17] package of mystery is given
[0:20] you will receive him as elijah but if
[0:23] you are not among this one you will of
[0:26] course not take him as a prophet
[0:28] and you'll be very right
[0:32] scripturally
[0:33] scientifically and everything you prove
[0:36] him out
[0:39] if you take him verbatim by what he will
[0:41] say what did he say are you elijah no
[0:44] are you not a prophet no
[0:46] who are you i'm just the voice of him
[0:47] that is to come
[0:49] and
[0:50] crying in the wilderness
[0:52] so brother i give you to understand the
[0:54] prophet this man you are calling a
[0:56] prophet himself he denied
[0:58] he said i'm not and brother many times
[1:01] he says i am not maybe the one i am
[1:03] laying the foundation for him to come
[1:05] i'm laying the foundation that is on
[1:08] purpose
[1:10] [Applause]
[1:13] on the purpose
[1:18] blessing
[1:20] on a purpose that's why he said it is
[1:23] broken it's but it's not broken to the
[1:26] public is
[1:28] the seal is broken it's not broken it's
[1:31] it's not
[1:32] so which is switch
[1:37] on
[1:38] purpose and then the others were saying
[1:41] he has said they are not revealed they
[1:43] are not
[1:45] they have quotes
[1:48] and even those who say john the baptist
[1:50] is not a prophet they have a quote it's
[1:52] there in the bible it's written
[1:54] he denied it
[1:56] but jesus says if you
[1:58] receive it
[1:59] [Music]
[2:01] this is him
[2:03] the elijah the alliance who was to come
[2:07] so to you who are ready to receive it
[2:08] receive it and there are those who are
[2:10] not going to receive it they have their
[2:12] scripture
[2:15] this is to whom
[2:16] to those who take me
[2:19] me
[2:20] what i reveal to them and those who take
[2:22] the the letter
[2:25] that is for those of the letter but this
[2:27] is to those who receive revelation
[2:30] now this is me revealing this to you
[2:33] he is him
[2:35] he is that prophet
[2:36] but the letter which is written there
[2:38] says he said i am not so the letter
[2:41] blinds them but now this is revelation
[2:44] so it's up to you which of the two are
[2:46] you going to take
[2:49] if you remain in the office of the
[2:51] prophet the prophet will deny that he is
[2:53] a prophet
[2:57] but if you go beyond
[2:59] more than a prophet and you go to what
[3:02] the prophet introduced so the one the
[3:04] prophet introduced will tell you the
[3:07] mystery
[3:08] of what he did and what he is
[3:11] and then you know how to treasure what
[3:13] he introduced
