[17:15] as we pray together I have a special
[17:17] prayer request I'd like for us all to
[17:19] pray together some of you may have heard
[17:21] but we heard tragic news that brother
[17:23] Jim McNulty had to go into the hospital
[17:26] with uh I think it was a blood infection
[17:29] it was determined it was septic and they
[17:31] had to amputate both of his legs and so
[17:35] that's a tragedy for the family for the
[17:38] McNulty family for brother Jim so I'd
[17:40] like as a congregation while we're
[17:42] standing just above our heads and pray
[17:43] for him together
[17:45] dear heavenly father
[17:49] God at times like this we have nowhere
[17:51] else to turn nor but to come to you who
[17:54] is the Strong Tower that the righteous
[17:56] run into
[17:57] are safe
[17:59] Lord our brother his family have just
[18:02] been struck Lord with a trial
[18:04] that is unimaginable Lord

[18:10] you're not shocked you know exactly what
[18:12] you're doing
[18:13] God we're going to put our trust and our
[18:16] confidence in you but we ask Lord that
[18:19] you would come and shelter this family
[18:21] that you would be a great comforter to
[18:24] them and their great time of need
[18:26] we pray that you would touch brother Jim
[18:28] and that you would heal him after this
[18:30] surgery restore his strength and allow
[18:33] him to go home well
[18:34] God their life has changed Lord but God

[18:53] closer than a brother now is when they
[18:55] need you more
[18:56] than ever before Oh we as an assembly we
[19:00] love our brother God we ask that you
[19:02] would move over him comfort him

[19:09] let your love envelop him and may he
[19:11] feel you as a tangible presence
[19:13] comforting him and guiding him back to
[19:15] strength and the family as well
[19:18] Lord this morning as we look into your
[19:20] word God I pray that you'd give us the
[19:22] strength we need to be all you've called
[19:25] us to be in this hour
[19:27] God for you have placed us here by your
[19:29] predetermined will by your foreknowledge
[19:31] you knew that we would be here you knew
[19:33] the obstacles we would face and do the
[19:35] condition of the world all around us
[19:38] but God you've equipped us Lord by
[19:40] predestination to meet the challenge of
[19:42] the hour
[19:43] and I pray God that you would come and
[19:45] give us more of yourself
[19:47] that we might have more strength more
[19:49] wisdom more understanding more light
[19:51] that we might know how to walk in this
[19:53] dark world may you reveal yourself to us
[19:56] in a greater way rub the I sap in our
[19:59] eyes Lord this morning that we might see
[20:01] you more clearly we ask for these things
[20:04] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[20:07] amen
[20:09] God bless you while we're standing let's
[20:11] turn to the book of Deuteronomy please
[20:15] Deuteronomy
[20:18] chapter
[20:20] 4 Deuteronomy chapter four I'd also like
[20:24] to let you know that um I had mentioned
[20:27] to you before the group that of X Amish
[20:30] that's down in Junction City Ohio that
[20:31] was baptized we were there where the
[20:33] Kyle and I were there to witness 17 of
[20:35] them being baptized and they called the
[20:38] man there who's the Elder in the group
[20:39] called and asked if we'd be able to come
[20:41] down and Minister for him so Brother
[20:43] Kyle will be going there next Sunday so
[20:46] the 23rd brother Kyle's going down the
[20:47] minister for that group so please be
[20:49] praying that God will give him
[20:50] inspiration and Leadership and wisdom to
[20:53] help them and then if things continue on
[20:55] as they are it looks like I'll be taking
[20:57] next month one of the services uh I
[21:00] think the 21st if I got that date right
[21:01] so just be praying that we can be a
[21:03] blessing to them and help them as they
[21:05] get started and move and the things have
[21:07] gone so it's really exciting to see what
[21:09] God is doing and it's exciting to be
[21:11] able to help him in any way we can
[21:14] so let's read while we're standing
[21:15] Deuteronomy chapter 4.
[21:17] verse 10. all right let's start at verse
[21:20] 9. Deuteronomy 4 and 9.
[21:25] only take heed to thyself and keep thy
[21:27] Soul diligently lest thou forget the
[21:30] things which thine eyes have seen unless
[21:32] thou depart from thy heart all the days
[21:35] of thy life but teach them thy sons and
[21:38] thy Sons Sons specially the day that
[21:41] thou stood us before the Lord thy God
[21:43] and them when the Lord said unto
[21:45] me gather me the people together and I
[21:47] will make them hear my words that they
[21:50] may learn to fear me all the days that
[21:52] they shall live upon the Earth and that
[21:54] they may teach their children and you
[21:57] came near and stood under the mountain
[21:58] and the mountain burned with fire unto
[22:00] the midst of heaven with Darkness clouds
[22:03] and thick Darkness I want to highlight
[22:05] that statement there with Darkness
[22:07] clouds and thick darkness and the Lord
[22:10] spake unto you out of the midst of the
[22:12] fire you heard the voice of the words
[22:15] but saw no similitude Only You Heard a
[22:18] Voice and he declared unto you his
[22:20] Covenant which he commanded you to
[22:22] perform even the Ten Commandments and he
[22:24] wrote them upon two tables of stone amen
[22:28] God bless us as we look at his word as
[22:29] you have your seats
[22:31] amen I want to
[22:34] take for a subject this morning light in
[22:37] the Darkness
[22:38] light in the darkness hear what Moses is
[22:40] speaking again to the children of Israel
[22:43] amen as they're coming to the end of
[22:45] their Wilderness Journey he's recapping
[22:48] many of the things that they've been
[22:49] through and bringing back to the
[22:50] remembrance their journey and here he
[22:53] reminds them of the day they stood in
[22:55] Mount Sinai and and I just went to the
[22:59] to point out verse 11 again if we just
[23:00] read that together and you came near and
[23:03] stood under the mountain and the
[23:04] mountain burned with fire unto the midst
[23:06] of heaven with Darkness clouds and thick
[23:10] darkness and so I I want to highlight
[23:13] that and then let's jump over to Exodus
[23:14] chapter 20 together
[23:19] Exodus chapter 20.
[23:28] and let's look at Verse 18 Exodus
[23:32] chapter 20
[23:35] and verse 18.
[23:38] this is Moses now he's we're speaking of
[23:41] the same incidentally now we're in
[23:42] Exodus Exodus 2018 and all the people
[23:45] saw the thunderings and the Lightnings
[23:46] and the noise of the trumpet and the
[23:48] mountain smoking and when the people saw
[23:50] it they removed and stood afar off
[23:53] and they said unto Moses speak that with
[23:55] us and we will hear but let not God
[23:57] speak with us lest we die and Moses said
[24:00] unto the people fear not for God has
[24:03] come to prove you and that his fear may
[24:05] be before your face that you sin not and
[24:08] the people stood afar off and Moses Drew
[24:11] near unto the thick Darkness where God
[24:14] was
[24:16] amen this is the part that I want to
[24:17] highlight when they saw the the smoking
[24:21] furnace and they heard the thunderings
[24:23] and the Lightnings and they saw the the
[24:25] the the the darkness the thick Darkness
[24:28] amen they ran away they ran away from
[24:31] the thick Darkness they ran away from
[24:33] the image they saw from the Thundering
[24:34] from the shakings they stood afar off
[24:36] and they asked Moses to go for them
[24:38] because they couldn't go but it said
[24:41] then Moses
[24:42] I'll read this let's read this together
[24:45] verse 21 and the people stood afar off
[24:47] and Moses Drew near unto the thick
[24:50] Darkness where God was
[24:53] amen if you think about this they saw an
[24:56] image that terrified them something that
[24:58] they physically could not handle they
[25:01] were supposed to come up into the
[25:02] mountain but instead when God descended
[25:05] upon the mountain this way it was such a
[25:07] fearful sight that they fled from God
[25:09] even Moses said he feared and quaked
[25:11] amen but they fled away but it says
[25:14] Moses Drew near into the thick Darkness
[25:17] the very thing that they were afraid of
[25:19] Moses Drew near into the thick Darkness
[25:21] where God was
[25:23] God was right in the midst of that scary
[25:27] scene amen God was right in the midst of
[25:29] that fearful sign God was in the thick
[25:32] Darkness
[25:34] so what was in the thick Darkness light
[25:37] amen what in Moses who did Moses meet
[25:40] when he got into the thick Darkness he
[25:42] met God Amen God was there what did God
[25:44] give him God gave him his word which is
[25:46] his light his illumination there was
[25:48] light in the middle of the thick
[25:51] Darkness amen but it scared everybody
[25:53] away amen but Moses approached unto the
[25:56] thick Darkness where God was
[26:00] amen you can see why amen there's so
[26:04] many scarecrows and so many things that
[26:06] frighten people away from the true
[26:08] revelation of God but I'm telling you
[26:10] he's in the thick Darkness amen
[26:13] and then if we could bring the
[26:14] PowerPoint up
[26:15] I want to go through some quotes I got
[26:17] quite a few scriptures and quotes I want
[26:19] to read so I put them in a PowerPoint so
[26:21] I can move quickly through it so we want
[26:23] to discuss light in the darkness amen
[26:27] First Kings 8 10 and 12 were at the
[26:29] dedication of the temple that Solomon
[26:31] built he says and it came to pass when
[26:33] the priests were come out of the Holy
[26:35] place that the cloud filled the house of
[26:38] the Lord so that the priest could not
[26:39] stand to minister because of the clown
[26:41] for the glory the lord had filled the
[26:43] house of the Lord then spake Solomon the
[26:46] Lord said that he would dwell in the
[26:49] thick Darkness
[26:50] amen so the Lord said he would dwell in
[26:54] the thick Darkness where was he on Mount
[26:56] Sinai in the thick Darkness where was he
[26:58] in the temple in the thick Darkness amen
[27:00] so so I mean it it some things look dark
[27:04] and frightening amen and many times it's
[27:06] God
[27:09] amen praise the Lord amen things when we
[27:12] start to look at the Bible and we start
[27:14] to look and apply it to life we begin to
[27:18] realize that there's nothing new Under
[27:19] the Sun and the Bible explains
[27:21] everything even then it becomes a living
[27:23] book for us and many of the things that
[27:25] we were afraid of before become
[27:28] Revelations to us
[27:30] ways in which we see the light
[27:34] in Exodus 14 verse 19
[27:37] . this is The Exodus Journey after
[27:39] they've left Egypt amen and they're
[27:42] they're in the wilderness and now
[27:43] they're up against the Red Sea and
[27:44] Pharaoh's Army is coming it says in the
[27:46] angel of God which went before the camp
[27:48] Israel removed and went behind them and
[27:51] the pillar of the cloud went from before
[27:52] their face and stood behind them and it
[27:54] came between the camp of the Egyptians
[27:56] and the camp of Israel and it was a
[27:58] cloud of Darkness to them
[28:01] but it gave light by night to those
[28:04] to these so the one came not near the
[28:07] other all night
[28:10] what was this this was the pillar of
[28:12] fire this was the manifestation of God
[28:14] in that day
[28:16] and so God was now standing between the
[28:19] armies of pharaoh and between the
[28:22] children of Israel amen and the pillar
[28:24] of fire had moved itself there amen and
[28:26] it was standing there the angel of the
[28:28] Covenant the Lord Jesus Christ was
[28:30] standing there to separate the two it
[28:33] was Darkness to them
[28:35] but it was light to those to these it
[28:39] depended on who you were and depended on
[28:42] what you saw amen so to some amen the
[28:46] the very manifestation of the word was
[28:49] Darkness to others it was light
[28:52] to some it was fearful and kept them at
[28:55] Bay to others it gave them the light
[28:57] they meant to walk by
[29:00] as they walked through the Red Sea
[29:02] so you can see how God Amen he hides
[29:06] himself in thick Darkness but as Solomon
[29:09] said God said he would be in the thick
[29:11] Darkness so they looked and saw black
[29:14] angry billowing clowns that would keep
[29:17] the Chariots back amen but the children
[29:19] of Israel was a bright light to walk by
[29:22] amen and we live in a day amen we're God
[29:25] where the pillar of fire has returned
[29:27] back and the word is coming to full
[29:29] manifestation and to many it's Darkness
[29:33] but depending on where you are Amen in
[29:35] your perspective and what camp you're in
[29:37] to some it's Darkness it's a mystery
[29:40] it's uncomprehendable it's Unthinkable
[29:43] but to us it's light to walk by amen
[29:46] and it brings the separation between the
[29:49] two camps what separated them amen what
[29:52] separated them is what they saw
[29:55] because they saw the darkness and held
[29:59] back others saw the light and moved
[30:02] forward
[30:04] so what brought the separation was the
[30:06] manifestation of the word
[30:08] praise be to God
[30:12] in John 1 1 we we know this so well but
[30:16] I love this scripture in the beginning
[30:18] was the word and the Word was with God
[30:19] and the Word was God
[30:21] the same was in the beginning with God
[30:23] all things were made by him and without
[30:25] him was not anything made that was made
[30:27] in him was life and the life was the
[30:30] light of men
[30:32] and the light shineth in darkness and
[30:35] the Darkness comprehended it not
[30:38] that's the way it's always been in every
[30:40] age
[30:41] as the word comes into manifestation
[30:43] it's a light Amen in the word is life
[30:47] and that life is the light of men so in
[30:50] the word is life and that life is light
[30:53] illumination light to walk by
[30:56] amen but this light now is always
[30:59] shining the darkness of this Earth amen
[31:03] It Shine in the darkness and the
[31:04] Darkness comprehended it not amen but
[31:06] praise God there were some who
[31:09] comprehended it
[31:10] and when Jesus Christ came he was this
[31:13] word made Flash and when he came he is
[31:16] the light of the world he said I am the
[31:18] light of the world Amen but many who saw
[31:20] him didn't see light when they saw him
[31:22] they saw Darkness amen they saw a human
[31:26] being stoop shouldered 30 years old
[31:28] looked like he was 50 uh with a
[31:30] reputation of an illegitimate birth
[31:32] coming out of a place called Nazareth
[31:34] all they could see was Darkness
[31:37] Darkness Darkness where was where was
[31:40] God he was in the midst of the darkness
[31:42] amen hiding himself in the darkness of a
[31:45] human figure amen that that had no
[31:47] coming this that we should desire him
[31:49] amen that didn't come as a bright
[31:52] shining light outwardly came as a human
[31:54] being amen and probably not the way
[31:56] brother Brahm describes it amen not the
[31:59] most glorious strong tall amen he came
[32:02] as a humble human being in the form of a
[32:05] humble human being amen and his birth
[32:08] was questionable more Darkness
[32:12] and the city he lived in was undesirable
[32:15] more Darkness
[32:18] and the religious leaders of the world
[32:19] rejected him more darkness and more
[32:21] darkness and more Darkness until the
[32:24] people were afraid to draw near the
[32:26] thick Darkness but what was in that
[32:28] Darkness was the light the life amen
[32:32] but thank God there was some who wanted
[32:35] to draw near to what others saw as
[32:37] Darkness they saw as light amen
[32:40] praise God
[32:42] in Matthew 4 12
[32:44] scripture says now when Jesus had heard
[32:47] that John was cast into prison
[32:49] he departed into Galilee and leaving
[32:51] Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum
[32:53] which is upon the Seacoast and in the
[32:56] borders of Zebulon and Nephilim that it
[32:59] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[33:00] Isaiah the prophet saying the land of
[33:03] zebulun and the land of Nephilim by the
[33:06] way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of
[33:09] the Gentiles
[33:11] this is the land of the Gentiles
[33:14] and look at our timing when Jesus heard
[33:16] that John was cast in the prison John's
[33:19] Ministry is now ending Jesus now is
[33:21] coming on the scene and where is he at
[33:23] in the land of the Gentiles
[33:26] what's the next line people with satin
[33:29] Darkness saw great life
[33:31] and then which sat in the region in the
[33:33] shadow of death light has sprung up from
[33:37] that time Jesus began to preach and to
[33:39] say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is
[33:41] at hand amen do you see your day
[33:45] amen do you see your day amen Christ is
[33:48] now come on the scene and the land of
[33:49] the Gentiles and light has sprung up in
[33:52] darkness and the in the place of the
[33:54] shadow of death light has sprung up
[33:58] amen and in laodicea which is at the end
[34:02] of the laodicean church age brother
[34:04] Branham said it's a complete blackout a
[34:06] total apostasy in the church amen and
[34:09] where does the light the light is sprung
[34:11] up Amen in the shadow of death
[34:15] Hallelujah
[34:17] God is so good
[34:20] Job 38
[34:23] verse 4.
[34:26] where was thou when I laid the
[34:28] foundation of the earth God's now
[34:29] bringing his attention to Creation
[34:32] declared if thou has understanding who
[34:34] hath laid the measure thereof without
[34:36] knowest or who has stretched the line
[34:38] upon it whereupon are the foundations
[34:40] thereof fastened or who laid the
[34:42] Cornerstone thereof
[34:44] when the morning Stars sang together and
[34:46] all the sons of God shouted for Joy or
[34:48] who showed up to see with doors when it
[34:50] breaks forth as if it had issued out of
[34:53] the womb when I made the cloud the
[34:56] Garment thereof in thick Darkness a
[34:58] swaddling band for it
[35:00] and break up it for and break up for it
[35:03] my decreed place and set bars and doors
[35:06] and said hitherto shall Thou come but no
[35:08] further and there shall thy proud waves
[35:11] be stayed
[35:13] so the the highlighted portion there it
[35:16] says when I made a cloud the Garment
[35:18] thereof in thick Darkness a swaddling
[35:20] band
[35:22] so we find in Genesis 1 that the Earth
[35:25] is shrouded in darkness and this is what
[35:28] God is speaking to in job he goes I made
[35:30] the cloud the Garment thereof I wrapped
[35:32] it in a clown and thick Darkness a
[35:35] swaddling band for it so the Earth is
[35:38] wrapped in thick Darkness
[35:40] we see that in Genesis chapter one in
[35:43] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[35:45] the Earth period and now we're going to
[35:48] find it in the form he spoke to De job
[35:50] the Earth was without form and void and
[35:53] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[35:54] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[35:57] face of the waters
[35:59] amen there was a thick Darkness all over
[36:01] the Earth
[36:03] amen
[36:05] it was a swaddling band
[36:07] of thick Darkness
[36:09] but praise God in the fourth seal
[36:12] brother Birmingham tells us there was
[36:13] something in that Darkness
[36:15] says I was talking to a person not long
[36:17] ago he was trying to discuss with me and
[36:19] saying aren't you ashamed to say that
[36:22] God created the heavens and the Earth in
[36:23] three days or in six days
[36:25] I said that's what the Bible said well
[36:27] we've got evidence and can prove that
[36:29] the world is millions of years old I
[36:31] said that didn't have anything to do
[36:32] with it in Genesis 1 1 it said in the
[36:34] beginning God created the heavens and
[36:36] earth period see that's all now the
[36:38] world without form and void and I said I
[36:41] believe every seed was laying right
[36:43] there from some other civilization or
[36:45] something
[36:46] and as soon as the water lifted off of
[36:49] the the light Struck it and up come the
[36:51] trees and everything so I get back
[36:54] because I don't want to read the rest of
[36:55] the quote yet
[36:57] so so now brother Ben saying that we
[37:01] find Earth in a form of judgment Amen in
[37:03] the cloud is its garment and it's
[37:05] swaddled and swallowing band of thick
[37:07] Darkness but brother Benham says
[37:09] underneath there is seeds amen and
[37:12] they're germatized seeds with life
[37:14] inside of them what's in the thick
[37:17] Darkness life is laying there the
[37:19] potential waiting for something it's in
[37:21] the thick Darkness amen it wasn't I mean
[37:24] it wasn't what you thought there's
[37:26] nothing here there's nothing good here
[37:27] oh yes there's something laying there
[37:30] and in the right condition out of the
[37:32] thick darkness is going to come life
[37:36] and so we know that God by a spoken word
[37:38] begins by the word to create the
[37:41] condition that's right and part the
[37:43] clouds and bring the line and when he
[37:44] does the light strikes the seed and the
[37:47] seed comes forth to life and shows that
[37:49] there was life in the thick Darkness
[37:51] there was there was life laying there
[37:53] dormant waiting for the right season it
[37:55] wasn't dead it wasn't scary it was a
[37:58] Rejuvenation of life
[38:01] but then here's what brother bam says
[38:03] next
[38:05] he says the same thing with the human
[38:08] being
[38:09] it's a type
[38:12] when all the Mist has moved away and the
[38:15] revealed truth to that real seed laying
[38:17] there still germatized and the light of
[38:19] the gospel and Strike It by a true
[38:20] Vindication the word it'll live it's got
[38:23] life in it
[38:27] amen we come into this world
[38:30] born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to
[38:32] the world speaking lies shrouded in
[38:35] darkness
[38:36] but some have a seed
[38:40] from a previous civilization or
[38:43] something
[38:44] and that seed has life in it amen and
[38:47] what's in the thick Darkness the in the
[38:50] thick darkness is a child of God waiting
[38:53] to be expressed an attribute a portion
[38:55] of God a piece of the word
[38:58] and where is it it's wrapped in the
[39:00] thick darkness of Fallen Humanity of a
[39:03] fallen human being born wrong come
[39:05] hybrid come into the world speaking lies
[39:08] with a mind alienated and darkened to
[39:10] the things of God completely
[39:12] overshadowed with the cloud completely
[39:14] swaddled in a thick Darkness but down in
[39:16] there is an attribute of God
[39:19] life it's got life in it
[39:22] praise God
[39:24] you know
[39:25] this message
[39:28] came to give us a true identification
[39:33] this message didn't come Amen to create
[39:36] another religious movement
[39:39] another founder with a set of teachings
[39:42] that has nothing to do with what this
[39:45] message is it's not a Founder with a set
[39:46] of teaching amen it is an actual peeling
[39:49] open of the revelation of God himself so
[39:52] that you know who you really are so
[39:53] you'll never be stumbled again amen you
[39:56] were born wrong brother Ben said of no
[39:58] fault of your own amen it happened in
[40:00] the Garden of Eden you come subject to
[40:02] that swallowed uh swaddled and Fallen
[40:05] Humanity
[40:09] but oh praise God there was a seed with
[40:12] life in it laying there
[40:14] and what was that seed listen friends
[40:17] that seed that you that that seed was
[40:19] not you as far as a hybrid creature that
[40:23] seed is a portion of God himself
[40:26] so what is their word and the word has
[40:29] life and the life is light so what's in
[40:32] the midst of Darkness there's a little
[40:34] piece of light laying down
[40:36] there
[40:38] shrouded in darkness
[40:42] that's why for me
[40:44] I don't count anybody out
[40:47] I don't count anybody out
[40:50] because we all come wrapped in darkness
[40:52] overshadowed
[40:53] totally alienated to the things of God
[40:56] Amen just because somebody's walking
[40:59] around swaddled in complete darkness and
[41:02] in a thick cloud of humanity and you can
[41:04] see the thick cloud of Fallen State all
[41:06] around them amen that doesn't mean that
[41:09] there's no life inside of there it
[41:11] doesn't mean there's no seed there
[41:14] amen I don't know where it's at only God
[41:17] knows where it's at but when God by the
[41:20] spoken word begins to bring the right
[41:21] condition to that piece of Earth amen
[41:24] that life will Spring forth
[41:27] so when it looks like nothing good is
[41:29] there amen they said can anything good
[41:31] comes out of Nazareth amen it's rumored
[41:34] that his mother amen had an affair with
[41:36] the soldier and he's the product of
[41:38] adultery amen can anything good come out
[41:40] of that amen yes something good can come
[41:42] out of that because God is coming out of
[41:45] that
[41:49] anything good
[41:51] come out of the thick Darkness
[41:53] yes
[41:56] it can
[41:59] brother man I'm speaking here of John
[42:02] chapter 4 and John chapter 4 is the
[42:03] story of the woman at the well when he
[42:05] had needs to go by Samaria amen and he
[42:08] says that woman knowed more about the
[42:10] scripture than them priests did
[42:12] I'll say one thing she know more about
[42:14] it him than a lot of preachers today
[42:17] that's right yes sir yes she knew him
[42:19] why I believe that that seed of eternal
[42:22] life laid within the woman
[42:24] and when the light flashed on it quickly
[42:26] she recognized it
[42:30] amen let's turn to John chapter four and
[42:32] let's just look at this quickly
[42:52] I believe we're going to spend some time
[42:54] in this in another service but I just
[42:56] want to hit just a point or two here
[42:59] Jesus begins a dialogue with the woman
[43:01] in John chapter four she's a Samaritan
[43:04] he's a Jew supposedly and and he begins
[43:08] his dialogue because he had needs to go
[43:09] by Samaria
[43:12] because he's led by the father
[43:16] amen because
[43:18] he's seeking and saving that which is
[43:20] lost
[43:23] amen it was lost but it hadn't always
[43:25] been lost
[43:27] because in order to lose something you
[43:28] have to have it first
[43:31] so if he's seeking and saving that which
[43:32] is lost then there's something that he
[43:35] had attributes of himself that are now
[43:38] in a lost condition and he's there
[43:40] seeking those pieces of himself that's
[43:43] lost
[43:44] praise God
[43:47] and let's go let's just pick it up in
[43:50] verse 19.
[43:52] the woman said unto him sir I perceive
[43:53] that thou art a prophet our fathers
[43:55] worshiped in this mountain and ye say
[43:57] that in Jerusalem is the place where men
[43:59] ought to worship Jesus is saying that
[44:01] her woman believe me the hour cometh
[44:03] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[44:04] nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father
[44:07] ye worship you know not what we know
[44:09] what we worship for the Salvation for
[44:11] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[44:13] cometh and now is when the true
[44:15] worshiper shall worship the father in
[44:17] spirit and in truth for the father
[44:19] seeketh such to worship Him
[44:21] God is a spirit and they that worship
[44:23] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[44:26] truth
[44:27] this woman has been asking
[44:31] um
[44:31] she's up to this point she's been asking
[44:34] natural questions
[44:36] how will you get this water you don't
[44:39] have a bucket
[44:41] he said I'll give you water he's
[44:43] speaking spiritual she's thinking
[44:45] natural
[44:46] yeah then he begins to address the
[44:48] condition in her life you've got five
[44:50] husbands the one this is all natural and
[44:52] then she says I perceive you're a
[44:54] prophet because you can discern my life
[44:56] now where do I worship do I go in
[44:58] Jerusalem or worship she's looking at a
[45:00] natural place
[45:01] or on this mountain do I worship and and
[45:04] he keeps giving spiritual answers
[45:09] amen he's not trying to hit her
[45:11] intellect
[45:13] he's trying to go deeper than that
[45:16] he's not trying to convince her of the
[45:19] right way to bring a sacrifice in the
[45:21] right place and the Jews haven't been in
[45:22] the Samaritans and our doctrine's a
[45:24] little better than your Doctrine and
[45:26] he's trying to get down to that Soul
[45:28] where that life is and he's trying to
[45:31] bring some light of the word to strike
[45:33] that seed amen
[45:35] so he's speaking spiritually he said God
[45:38] is a spirit and they that worship we
[45:39] must worship Him in spirit and Truth
[45:41] he's breaking apart all of her normals
[45:44] everything that's normal is breaking
[45:46] apart I mean she's asked the question
[45:47] okay so there's a big there's a big
[45:49] religious debate
[45:51] is it Jerusalem that we worship is it
[45:54] Samaria I've heard both and Jesus just
[45:57] abolishes all her understanding and
[45:59] saying the father is not seeking any to
[46:01] worship that way anymore but we're
[46:03] moving to another dispensation and God
[46:05] wants a worshiper to worship Him in
[46:07] spirit and in truth not in physical
[46:09] location
[46:13] and you this is this is an uneducated
[46:15] unthiologically trained woman
[46:18] and he's not trying to appeal to her
[46:21] mind
[46:22] he's trying to bring light to that scene
[46:25] now look at her response
[46:27] and the woman saith unto him
[46:30] I know that messiah's cometh
[46:32] and he's called Christ when he has come
[46:34] he will tell us all things
[46:37] she was recognizing this is different
[46:41] now if a Pharisee had been standing
[46:43] there the Pharisee would put up a good
[46:44] argument because no the law says and
[46:47] Moses told us in the furniture and then
[46:49] Solomon established and David said and
[46:54] you can't just change everything
[46:57] right we're sticking with the scriptures
[47:00] amen we're sticking with Moses and what
[47:02] David commissioned when Solomon
[47:04] established and what was returned when
[47:06] we came out of Babylon and God spoke
[47:08] amen through the prophets and it's a
[47:10] rubable building
[47:13] they had lots of scriptures
[47:15] amen but the scriptures were telling
[47:18] them historically what happened but all
[47:20] the scriptures were pointing to another
[47:21] happening
[47:23] and now Jesus is moving above the
[47:26] technicals of textbooks and he's coming
[47:29] to the real heart the real transition
[47:31] period and the real truth of the spirit
[47:33] and what God is seeking and there's a
[47:35] woman here who's not getting caught up
[47:37] in the textbook religion she's able to
[47:40] sense that's true amen and the only
[47:43] person who's going to give us these kind
[47:44] of answers is Messiah when he comes
[47:46] he'll tell us all things and Jesus says
[47:49] I am he that speaketh to you
[47:51] you know he doesn't do that anywhere
[47:53] else amen he goes around they ask him to
[47:55] tell us plainly who you are and he never
[47:57] answers them but until he finds a
[47:59] predestinated seed because he always
[48:01] reveals himself to the predestinated
[48:03] scene
[48:07] it's a
[48:08] I was speaking to them he
[48:11] and upon this came his disciples now
[48:13] watch this scripture
[48:15] an opponents came his disciples and
[48:17] marveled that he talked with the woman
[48:20] because all they could see was thick
[48:22] Darkness
[48:26] they marveled that he talked to this
[48:29] woman I mean she's a Samaritan she's
[48:31] obviously coming at the wrong hour of
[48:33] the day indicating she's not a clean
[48:35] woman she's not got a good reputation
[48:37] and you guys are here alone and we've
[48:40] been gone and we come back and you're
[48:41] talking to this woman and they marveled
[48:43] and he talked to the woman because all
[48:45] they could see was the thick Darkness
[48:47] but Jesus knew what was in the thick
[48:49] Darkness was a peace of God a seed Gene
[48:53] of God was laying in the thick Darkness
[48:56] so Jesus wasn't afraid of the thick
[48:59] Darkness
[49:00] he wasn't afraid to approach to the
[49:03] thick Darkness
[49:05] I hope we're not afraid to approach
[49:08] those that are wrapped in thick Darkness
[49:13] amen
[49:15] Jesus was Secure in who he was
[49:18] so he wasn't afraid to approach this
[49:20] woman
[49:23] I hope we're secure enough in Who We Are
[49:25] that the thick Darkness on the outside
[49:27] of people doesn't scare us away
[49:29] because we're looking for seed
[49:32] we're looking for light we're looking
[49:34] for a piece of God hiding in the thick
[49:36] Darkness
[49:39] amen so we see now brother van tells us
[49:43] that about this woman that she there was
[49:46] a seed of eternal life laid within that
[49:48] woman and she recognized it she was
[49:52] wrapped in thick Darkness you agree with
[49:55] me on that didn't look good didn't look
[49:58] like a place of Life didn't look like
[50:00] there was any life down in there amen
[50:02] but Jesus was led to this piece of Earth
[50:05] to speak the word To Shine the Light the
[50:08] Light Strike the seed to bring the seed
[50:10] to life
[50:11] right
[50:13] and then it's amazing what what
[50:16] transpires after this I want to look at
[50:18] a scripture if I can remember where okay
[50:21] yeah let's go to Second Corinthians 11.
[50:25] second Corinthians 11 I want to contrast
[50:27] her with the religious leaders of the
[50:30] day
[50:33] second Corinthians
[50:37] 11.
[50:41] second Corinthians 11 and 13.
[50:49] so second Corinthians 11 13 for such are
[50:52] false Apostles deceitful workers
[50:54] transforming themselves into Apostles of
[50:56] Christ
[50:58] and no Marvel for Satan himself has
[51:00] transformed to an angel of Light
[51:03] therefore there's a no great thing if
[51:05] his ministers also be transformed as the
[51:07] Ministers of righteousness whose end
[51:09] shall be according to their works
[51:11] this is an amazing statement
[51:13] when you come to Satan Satan has
[51:16] transformed himself as an angel of Light
[51:18] and Satan is not thick Darkness
[51:21] [Music]
[51:23] he looks good
[51:25] many times it's the the real genuine
[51:28] seed of God that looks like thick
[51:30] Darkness
[51:31] what did the woman who washed Jesus feet
[51:34] look like compared to Simon
[51:36] Simon the Pharisee was religious he was
[51:39] clean on the outside he had everything
[51:41] going for him he made broad his
[51:43] phylacteries he made big boastful
[51:45] speeches on the corner he sat on the
[51:47] highest chief of seats he blew a trumpet
[51:49] every time he dropped his money into the
[51:51] tributary amen where where then the the
[51:54] little woman put two mites in and Jesus
[51:56] noticed that and said she gave more
[51:59] and now here comes a woman that is
[52:01] caught in adultery a man stuck in this
[52:03] horrible lifestyle amen but she
[52:05] recognizes Jesus Christ is in their
[52:07] midst unwelcomed amen and unkissed and
[52:10] uncared for and she runs in with the
[52:12] alabaster box to break an anoint his
[52:14] feet amen and she's doing all of this
[52:16] amen you stand back with humanistic eyes
[52:19] she's dark amen Simon is light
[52:22] but he has transformed himself into an
[52:25] angel's line amen but there's no life
[52:27] inside of him because if there was life
[52:29] inside of him he would have received the
[52:31] light that was Jesus Christ
[52:34] here's a woman in darkness and a dark
[52:37] life and everything about her is dark
[52:39] amen but she can see the light amen what
[52:43] was a cloud to one was a pillar of fire
[52:45] to another
[52:47] it was confusion to the to the religious
[52:50] things it's all confusion how could he
[52:52] be and it doesn't match what we think
[52:55] scripture should say and Bethlehem and
[52:57] this and a mighty deliver this and and
[52:59] it's all confusion to her it made
[53:02] perfect sense this is none other than
[53:04] Jesus Christ this is the messiah
[53:08] and she ran in there proving that
[53:11] shouted in her Darkness
[53:13] was light
[53:15] there was a seed of life
[53:17] down on the inside
[53:18] let's turn to Matthew
[53:25] 23.
[53:34] Matthew 23.
[53:39] and 27.
[53:43] Matthew 23 and 27.
[53:46] woe once you scribes and Pharisees
[53:48] hypocrites
[53:50] fear like unto why did sepulchers which
[53:52] indeed appear beautiful outward but are
[53:55] within full of dead men's bones and of
[53:58] all uncleanness
[54:01] this is what religion produces
[54:04] every time religious religion will
[54:08] produce a Whited Sepulcher
[54:12] it will produce religion is not going to
[54:15] bring life the word brings life
[54:18] religious forms and rituals and that
[54:20] doesn't bring life the word brings life
[54:23] the light of the hour brings the seed of
[54:26] the hour to life
[54:28] and so the Pharisees and and scribes and
[54:32] hypocrites they were they were outwardly
[54:35] not wrapped in darkness
[54:38] but inward it was Darkness
[54:42] for the woman at the well and the woman
[54:45] the adulterous woman who washed Jesus
[54:47] feet outwardly they were Darkness but
[54:49] inside there was a seed of light
[54:52] amen so God knows how to hide himself in
[54:57] the Darkness
[54:59] amen
[55:01] it's amazing that after
[55:04] the day of Pentecost when when the
[55:07] disciples go running onto the street
[55:09] performing Miracles testifying preaching
[55:11] the gospel amen Peter and John they went
[55:14] by the gate beautiful they healed a man
[55:16] who was a leper they got called on the
[55:17] carpet so to say and they got questioned
[55:20] about it and they said these men are
[55:22] ignorant unlearned I mean how I'm sure
[55:25] they were completely Bamboozled we've
[55:27] studied all our lives we we do all of
[55:28] this but and but look at what's
[55:30] happening look at what they're doing
[55:32] something is wrong because they look and
[55:34] see Darkness but there's Life coming out
[55:36] of darkness and they can't comprehend it
[55:39] and they're afraid of it and they're
[55:41] afraid to come near it
[55:42] amen but those who aren't afraid of it
[55:44] can come right into Christ
[55:47] praise God all right I'm going to keep
[55:49] moving I don't want to get hung up too
[55:51] much
[55:54] so then in God's provided place of
[55:56] worship
[55:57] says as I said the other day when God
[55:59] moved and struck the sun across the
[56:01] Earth he node them palm trees and
[56:02] everything was laying down under the
[56:04] Earth they were part of the earth at the
[56:06] time so were you
[56:08] and when he raised up the Son of God on
[56:10] Easter morning he sent forth the Holy
[56:12] Spirit it was to Quicken also that seed
[56:15] of eternal life that he foreknew before
[56:18] the foundation of the world that would
[56:20] be there would be here God knew that she
[56:23] would be here he sent the Holy Spirit to
[56:25] Quicken that seed to life
[56:28] amen
[56:29] for the scripture says in second
[56:30] Corinthians 4 6 for God who commanded
[56:32] the light to shine out of Darkness has
[56:35] shined in our hearts
[56:37] he caused the light to shine out of
[56:39] where out of Darkness
[56:41] first it was Darkness then light come
[56:43] out of Darkness
[56:44] then our hearts our minds were darkened
[56:47] to the things of God so then God shined
[56:50] the light in our Dark Places
[56:54] amen so he shine out of Darkness has
[56:57] shined in our hearts to give the light
[56:58] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[57:01] the face of Jesus Christ
[57:04] the message is super sign the prophet
[57:06] says the Solar Sun the Solar Sun up
[57:08] there s-u-n has control of all botany
[57:11] life when a seed is laying there and
[57:13] that sun strikes it it'll come to life
[57:14] yes sir and the s-o-n of God is the
[57:17] controller of all eternal life
[57:19] and if you've got a seat of life in you
[57:22] brother when that son strikes there and
[57:25] shows you what he is it comes to life
[57:28] there's no way of keeping it from it
[57:35] there's so many things that I want to go
[57:37] into so I just pray just just keep
[57:39] pulling amen I want to stop and relax
[57:40] for just a minute
[57:42] because
[57:44] we we get the wrong Notions about so
[57:47] many things because religious Notions
[57:48] they have a way of hanging on to us even
[57:51] though we don't want them to amen we
[57:52] want to lose everything but we hang them
[57:53] on and and we we have such a notion in
[57:57] ourselves about how we must approach
[58:00] unto God and and you know we must
[58:03] repent of these things and confess all
[58:05] the wrong things we've done and start
[58:07] doing right things and as we start doing
[58:09] right things we'll we'll become clean
[58:11] and then we can begin to approach unto
[58:13] God and God will accept us because he
[58:15] can see all of our efforts we're trying
[58:16] to live for him and blah blah blah blah
[58:19] blah blah blah it's our old
[58:21] denominational religious order that's
[58:23] failed
[58:25] it has failed over and over and over and
[58:27] over again it wasn't the plan of God the
[58:30] plan of God was to bring the light amen
[58:33] and when the light strikes the seed the
[58:35] seed comes to life that's God's plan
[58:38] amen we're going to go into that a
[58:39] little bit more and show how much of
[58:42] God's plan that is amen because when we
[58:44] start amen if we preach the gospel the
[58:47] wrong way and preach it in a Reformation
[58:49] message amen you're going to get people
[58:51] stuck in reformation and they're never
[58:52] going to move on with God Amen because
[58:55] they're going to always trying to reform
[58:56] reform so I can approach them to God and
[58:58] God will honor all my efforts and then
[59:00] he'll he'll give me more gifts or he'll
[59:02] bless me and put me into his kingdom and
[59:04] that's not the way it works amen it was
[59:06] everything amen oh my goodness
[59:09] everything that he wants out of your
[59:11] life he put in the seed
[59:16] and he planted that seed in dirt
[59:20] and it's shrouded in darkness and
[59:22] there's a cloud over top of it but he
[59:24] knows by the spoken word for your day
[59:26] how to change the conditions of your
[59:29] Earth so that the light strikes the seed
[59:31] inside and if it's a germinated seed
[59:33] it'll bring it to life and that seed
[59:36] will produce what's already in the seed
[59:43] Hallelujah
[59:45] so we've been taught
[59:48] through religious realms
[59:51] to try to manufacture a life
[59:55] before the light strikes the seed
[1:00:00] and it fails
[1:00:03] and that's why religious forms
[1:00:05] especially those that that are are more
[1:00:08] bent that direction have to come up with
[1:00:11] morals and more orders and more
[1:00:14] structure and more this and more
[1:00:17] programs and and more because what we're
[1:00:20] trying to do is reform the people we're
[1:00:22] trying if I could say it this way we are
[1:00:25] trying to get a rose bush to bloom
[1:00:29] when the lights never struck the sea
[1:00:35] I hope that makes sense
[1:00:39] so when the son strikes there
[1:00:43] it comes to life
[1:00:45] there's no way of keeping it from it
[1:00:50] when the True Light amen not the light
[1:00:54] that shined in another day but the light
[1:00:56] designated for this day
[1:00:59] the word made manifest in this day the
[1:01:02] revealed word of the hour is the light
[1:01:04] of the hour and the light of the hour is
[1:01:07] a certain light for a certain condition
[1:01:09] to match a certain seed and the seed of
[1:01:12] this hour will only come to life by the
[1:01:14] light of this hour
[1:01:15] and when the light of this hour strikes
[1:01:17] the seed of the hour you can't stop it
[1:01:20] from coming to life
[1:01:24] so what people don't need is our
[1:01:26] religion they need the word
[1:01:28] they don't they don't need religious
[1:01:31] order religious instruction what they
[1:01:33] need is the true revelation of the word
[1:01:34] and the true revelation of the word will
[1:01:36] do the work so when a Pharisee comes to
[1:01:38] God Amen he goes to school he gets
[1:01:41] orders he finds all the rituals and
[1:01:44] they've added to so much of evil God God
[1:01:46] required amen they add certain things to
[1:01:48] their costume they they add certain
[1:01:50] rituals they add certain Washings of
[1:01:52] pots and Washings at hand and he learns
[1:01:53] all of these things to approach unto God
[1:01:55] where there was a little woman out of
[1:01:57] well who had learned nothing amen but
[1:01:59] she come in contact with the Living Word
[1:02:01] The Living Word identified her showed
[1:02:04] her her condition showed her the place
[1:02:05] of worship and showed her that he is the
[1:02:08] messiah
[1:02:10] and immediately she dropped her water
[1:02:12] pot and ran into the City and said come
[1:02:15] see a man that told me everything I've
[1:02:17] ever done is not this the Messiah
[1:02:20] she didn't go to school she didn't get
[1:02:22] an order and Jesus never said now make
[1:02:25] sure you do this and don't forget to do
[1:02:26] that and before you go out witnessing
[1:02:28] make sure you do this
[1:02:30] the point was not to whitewash a
[1:02:34] Sepulcher the point was to bring life
[1:02:36] and the life would propagate more life
[1:02:40] and by her testimony and listen the
[1:02:43] Pharisee also when he was going through
[1:02:45] his religious order the Pharisee was
[1:02:48] doing everything to appear a certain way
[1:02:50] in the eyes of others
[1:02:53] so the Pharisees religion was
[1:02:57] self-serving
[1:02:59] does that make sense we say why do
[1:03:01] people love to be stuck in religious
[1:03:03] rigid systems like that because they
[1:03:05] look good they get something out of it
[1:03:08] listen I like structure rules and order
[1:03:11] my nature just fits in really nice
[1:03:16] and and I could flourish in a legalistic
[1:03:20] system
[1:03:22] is that right
[1:03:24] but somebody with a different nature
[1:03:26] than me
[1:03:27] can never flourish in that restrictive
[1:03:30] system
[1:03:31] they don't have that nature in them
[1:03:34] so in that system I would always be the
[1:03:37] good boy
[1:03:39] and they would always be the bad boy
[1:03:41] and because I could flourish and
[1:03:44] structure an order and rigidness
[1:03:46] and I may not like it but I can do it
[1:03:49] because they never could then I see that
[1:03:52] they fail but I succeed so now I'm saved
[1:03:55] and have the Holy Ghost and they don't
[1:03:57] so now my security is all in this system
[1:04:01] and it's completely wrong
[1:04:06] praise God
[1:04:08] I hope the devil gets stomped on hard
[1:04:10] today and exposed I hope the veil gets
[1:04:13] peeled back and we recognize that that's
[1:04:15] not it that's not what God's looking for
[1:04:16] he didn't want this woman to have to go
[1:04:18] through a school in certain structures
[1:04:20] and certain things like that amen she
[1:04:22] come to life and she ran and her
[1:04:24] testimony was not pointing anyone to
[1:04:26] herself her testimony says it's him look
[1:04:29] at him he's the Messiah surely he's not
[1:04:31] this the Messiah and the people never
[1:04:33] stopped at her and praised her glorious
[1:04:36] transformation no they went from her
[1:04:38] right back to the same source and come
[1:04:41] to the light themselves
[1:04:46] praise be to God that's it does it mean
[1:04:49] that she should continue on an adultery
[1:04:51] no does it mean she has to continue no
[1:04:53] because the life inside the seed will
[1:04:56] produce its own life amen if she had
[1:04:59] that experience as he was genuine see
[1:05:01] she will change the way she addresses
[1:05:02] she will change the places she goes she
[1:05:04] will change her relationships it will
[1:05:06] all change by a natural process of
[1:05:09] staying in the light and the light
[1:05:10] bringing life out of the seed and the
[1:05:13] seed bearing its own fruit
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:16] not system fruit
[1:05:20] genuine Christ fruit
[1:05:23] so she never her testimony listen I'll
[1:05:27] tell you it's something too her
[1:05:28] testimony didn't make her look good
[1:05:31] because he exposed all the bad things
[1:05:33] I've ever done that's the Messiah
[1:05:39] he he tore apart my religious ideas
[1:05:42] until I feel like I don't know nothing
[1:05:44] about the Bible
[1:05:47] that doesn't make you look good
[1:05:50] it's not this the Messiah isn't this the
[1:05:53] truth isn't this the real Christ in our
[1:05:55] day amen he's so peeled away so
[1:05:59] demolished My Religion so demolished my
[1:06:01] traditions until I don't even think I
[1:06:04] even know what this Bible is what it's
[1:06:06] about I don't know anything
[1:06:09] I thought I knew but now I don't know
[1:06:14] isn't this the Messiah
[1:06:18] praise be to God
[1:06:21] brother Branham he's in communion this
[1:06:23] is the last uh sermon as we have
[1:06:25] recorded that he preaches before he
[1:06:27] passes away
[1:06:28] he says like in the book here
[1:06:31] and the spot there was a talking about
[1:06:33] the two books being one The Book of Life
[1:06:34] The First Book of Life coming up was
[1:06:36] when you were born that was your natural
[1:06:38] birth but then one time way back down in
[1:06:41] there there was a little grain of life
[1:06:42] as I was explaining
[1:06:44] some of the young sisters at the house
[1:06:46] this afternoon
[1:06:47] see there's a little grain of Life
[1:06:48] laying there what you wonder where did
[1:06:50] it come from what the Australian listen
[1:06:53] you didn't get that seed later that seed
[1:06:57] was always in you
[1:07:01] brother man was explaining this
[1:07:03] where did it come from well these
[1:07:05] strange things I was saying this taking
[1:07:07] for myself like you was going to say
[1:07:09] William Branham well 40 years ago the
[1:07:12] William Branham it isn't the same one
[1:07:13] tonight
[1:07:15] if somebody back there would say William
[1:07:17] random he was a rank Rascal why he was
[1:07:20] shrouded in darkness
[1:07:21] he was swaddled in humanity
[1:07:27] amen now he's a ranked Rascal see
[1:07:28] because I was born of Charles and Ella
[1:07:30] Branham in their nature I was a sinner I
[1:07:33] came to the world a liar and all the
[1:07:34] habits of the world laid right in me but
[1:07:36] down in there too was another nature of
[1:07:39] presence
[1:07:41] didn't come later it was there it's
[1:07:44] always been in you it's part of you
[1:07:47] there was another nature presidency
[1:07:50] predestinated was in there by God in
[1:07:54] this same body see two Natures in there
[1:07:58] well I only catered to the one as I
[1:08:01] growed I grewed as a baby Dada first
[1:08:03] thing you know I come a liar become
[1:08:06] everything else that is sinner because I
[1:08:08] raised up that way but down in there was
[1:08:10] a little speck of Life all the time
[1:08:15] when he was a ranked Rascal a sinner
[1:08:17] amen when when when he took his gun to
[1:08:20] go murder the boys that beat him
[1:08:24] that was dark
[1:08:27] but in the darkness was a sieging of God
[1:08:31] which was life which is light
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:40] I'm so glad
[1:08:42] I when I recognized I was born
[1:08:45] I was born in a fallen condition
[1:08:49] my Earth was just as much in judgment as
[1:08:53] the Earth was in Genesis 1 2.
[1:08:55] this piece of Earth was standing in the
[1:08:58] same kind of judgment condition that
[1:09:01] that Earth was
[1:09:04] I was clouded my mind was clouded
[1:09:07] alienated from God with no understanding
[1:09:10] of God I was swaddled in the thick
[1:09:13] darkness of hybrid flesh
[1:09:18] but there was a seed from a previous
[1:09:20] civilization
[1:09:22] laying down in that Earth
[1:09:25] and all it needed was to come in contact
[1:09:28] under the right condition with the Sun
[1:09:31] and the sun in the right position
[1:09:35] would bring life out of that seed
[1:09:39] I couldn't save myself clean myself make
[1:09:42] myself perform
[1:09:44] but the life in the seed coming to life
[1:09:47] makes me what I always wanted to be
[1:09:52] not not even by my will but by his
[1:09:55] predestinated will not even it doesn't
[1:09:58] matter how much we desire oh I want to
[1:10:00] be a Son of God oh I want to serve God
[1:10:02] you can desire it all you want amen but
[1:10:04] your desire will never produce it it
[1:10:06] will be produced from the life on the
[1:10:08] inside
[1:10:10] when the Holy Spirit comes to that seed
[1:10:13] and quickens that seed to life and under
[1:10:15] the under the light of the word of God
[1:10:17] the spirit of God nurturing that seed
[1:10:19] bringing it into its full potential will
[1:10:21] produce the life you can never by
[1:10:24] willpower produce
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:30] that's why I I
[1:10:32] find Within Myself
[1:10:35] such a resistance to critical spirits
[1:10:41] because critical Spirits are criticizing
[1:10:44] everybody else and finding fault all the
[1:10:47] time
[1:10:49] and those critical Spirits finally I
[1:10:51] think some people think it's a gift
[1:10:54] but it's not one of the gifts of the
[1:10:55] Spirit
[1:10:58] but see that critical spirit all the
[1:11:01] time is always taking away diminishing
[1:11:05] ridiculing
[1:11:07] and the one who sits in the house was
[1:11:09] the critic becomes the expert
[1:11:13] you see criticism automatically even if
[1:11:16] the critic isn't inflating themselves
[1:11:18] they're automatically sitting in a
[1:11:20] higher position
[1:11:21] even if they don't say anything about
[1:11:23] themselves
[1:11:24] the fact that they're criticizing puts
[1:11:26] them in a higher position because now I
[1:11:28] find your faults
[1:11:30] and I just I I even used to be good at
[1:11:33] it I hate that thing now
[1:11:35] it's wickedness it's evil
[1:11:38] because as if I criticize somebody I'm
[1:11:42] going to get them to produce a better
[1:11:44] life like what is my criticism going to
[1:11:46] do
[1:11:48] when what they need is nurture under the
[1:11:51] light amen not criticism
[1:11:54] they need to be nurtured in the light of
[1:11:57] the word they need more word amen more a
[1:12:00] more a sunlight more word a better
[1:12:03] condition to bring forth more fruit they
[1:12:06] don't need criticism they need nurture
[1:12:08] under the word
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:13] so I say that's what I needed
[1:12:16] criticism never did me any good
[1:12:20] amen all it did was bring discouragement
[1:12:22] it caused me to have self-doubts it made
[1:12:25] me want to pull away
[1:12:27] Chris has never helped me but when
[1:12:29] somebody would come and nurture me in
[1:12:31] the word and just love me and encourage
[1:12:32] me and live a life before me it always
[1:12:34] inspired me to live a greater life
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:39] praise God
[1:12:41] now I I hope you know me long enough to
[1:12:43] know it I don't mean bypassing sin and
[1:12:46] overlooking it and acting like it's not
[1:12:47] there Sin is Sin
[1:12:49] but a lot of what we criticize is just
[1:12:51] immaturity
[1:12:54] people just need to grow up they need a
[1:12:56] little patience
[1:12:58] amen
[1:13:00] Ephesians 4 17 says this I say therefore
[1:13:03] and testify in the Lord that ye
[1:13:05] henceforth walked not as other Gentiles
[1:13:07] walk in the vanity of their mind
[1:13:10] having the understanding darkened being
[1:13:12] alienated from the life of God through
[1:13:14] the ignorance that is in them because of
[1:13:16] the blindness of their hearts he's
[1:13:18] telling you don't walk like this anymore
[1:13:21] that's how you used to walk that's how
[1:13:23] other Gentiles walk but this is not how
[1:13:25] you're supposed to walk
[1:13:27] why because he's revealed the word
[1:13:30] Ephesians 5 8 for ye were sometimes
[1:13:33] Darkness but now are you light in the
[1:13:37] Lord walk as children of the light
[1:13:40] amen we were Darkness but praise God we
[1:13:44] are now manifested as children of the
[1:13:46] light
[1:13:47] because there was a seed of life of
[1:13:50] light inside
[1:13:53] communion now this is finishing the
[1:13:55] quote where brother miniman started
[1:13:57] before what was it there was another
[1:13:59] William Branham see a little spot of
[1:14:02] eternal life down there from the genes
[1:14:04] of God the word of God that was placed
[1:14:07] in there each one of you can think of
[1:14:09] similar things it was working brother
[1:14:12] man was talking about he would look at
[1:14:13] nature and he would ask questions Little
[1:14:15] Flower last winter I I built a fire over
[1:14:18] top of you and now you're coming forward
[1:14:20] where did you come from and he's asking
[1:14:21] all these questions he said that was
[1:14:23] that little seed of life was stirring
[1:14:25] back then
[1:14:27] it was with him always a sieging of God
[1:14:30] a spot of eternal life it was always
[1:14:32] there amen what it needed is it needed
[1:14:35] to move into the right condition by the
[1:14:38] spoken word to bring it to life
[1:14:41] but it was there
[1:14:43] you see it was working not paragraph 50.
[1:14:46] then then look up to the trees and I
[1:14:48] think Leaf I seen you fall off last year
[1:14:50] where are you back there again where'd
[1:14:52] you come from what brought you here it
[1:14:54] was the eternal life working in the body
[1:14:57] now then one day as I walked on that
[1:15:00] voice talking don't never smoke drink or
[1:15:02] so forth and the young fellows and all
[1:15:04] got older see there was something moving
[1:15:07] but yet all at once
[1:15:09] I looked up and I said I'm not the son
[1:15:12] of Charles and Ella Brandon there's
[1:15:14] something calling like my little Eagle
[1:15:15] I'm not a chicken there's something up
[1:15:17] yonder somewhere oh great Jehovah
[1:15:19] wherever you are open up I want to come
[1:15:22] home there's something in me calling
[1:15:24] then I was born again
[1:15:28] that little life was laying there the
[1:15:30] life of water was poured upon it then it
[1:15:32] began to grow now the old life was
[1:15:34] forgiven put in the sea of God's
[1:15:36] forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered
[1:15:38] against me no more see now we stand
[1:15:40] Justified as though we never had sinned
[1:15:42] in the presence of God
[1:15:46] praise God
[1:15:48] oh
[1:15:50] what brought this birth
[1:15:54] a realization a revelation light
[1:15:58] striking the scene
[1:16:00] and broken cisterns he says it's just
[1:16:03] like I was speaking the other night
[1:16:05] about this little Eagle walking in the
[1:16:07] barnyard
[1:16:08] with the chicken and he never know
[1:16:11] nothing else but the chickens but he
[1:16:12] knowed there was something about him was
[1:16:14] different from the chickens
[1:16:16] and when his mother came hunting him and
[1:16:18] she screamed from above it was an eagles
[1:16:20] call Sea and he had to be an eagle to
[1:16:22] begin with or he would have never
[1:16:23] recognized that call see there has to be
[1:16:26] something there dermatized or it can
[1:16:28] never produce life
[1:16:30] and if the seed the word of God is in
[1:16:32] you the holy spirit is here now to
[1:16:35] dermatize that and bring it to a reality
[1:16:37] to you
[1:16:39] there has to be seed with life already
[1:16:41] in it down in you or you'll never hear
[1:16:43] it amen when the eagle scream went the
[1:16:46] chicken scattered amen but the eagle
[1:16:48] that was an eagle on the inside when the
[1:16:51] chicken scattered it looked up and said
[1:16:53] that sounds good to me
[1:16:57] that's why when so many people that we
[1:16:59] know heard the message to them the
[1:17:01] message is Darkness
[1:17:04] confusion scary stay away from me God
[1:17:08] doesn't work through prophets anymore
[1:17:09] it's it's a false Doctrine you're
[1:17:11] changing the Trinity amen there's all
[1:17:13] kinds of Darkness fearful Darkness
[1:17:17] but if you can have the courage to
[1:17:19] approach unto the darkness you'll find
[1:17:21] the light is in the darkness amen
[1:17:24] in the confusion and the different
[1:17:26] Doctrine different teaching I don't
[1:17:28] understand this I was raised all my life
[1:17:29] my grandparents were good people and
[1:17:31] they didn't believe this way and
[1:17:34] Darkness Darkness and how could one man
[1:17:37] be right and how could that man be the
[1:17:39] authority and a prophet and God doesn't
[1:17:41] even use prophets anymore Darkness
[1:17:43] Darkness Darkness amen but everybody
[1:17:46] runs from the darkness but Moses didn't
[1:17:48] run from the darkness
[1:17:51] and when Moses went into the darkness he
[1:17:54] received the word
[1:17:57] praise God
[1:18:02] amen it's not that it's not scary
[1:18:06] Moses trembled and Quake
[1:18:10] you got to go get you got to get past So
[1:18:13] Many religious Notions
[1:18:14] Traditions training friends and
[1:18:17] relationships former pastors and and
[1:18:20] family members pulling you back
[1:18:23] it's not that it's not fearful
[1:18:25] but yet
[1:18:27] Moses knew that that was God
[1:18:30] and he went anyways
[1:18:35] praise be to God
[1:18:38] and God's power to transform this is the
[1:18:40] part that I was mentioning earlier but I
[1:18:42] want to spend some time
[1:18:44] and through a seat of his word there's
[1:18:46] only one thing that can Quicken the word
[1:18:48] and that is the spirit
[1:18:50] for it is the life Giver to the word and
[1:18:52] when the life in the word meets the life
[1:18:54] of the spirit it produces whatever the
[1:18:57] seed is
[1:19:02] how many believe you're an end time
[1:19:04] sieging of God predestinated to be here
[1:19:06] in the end time
[1:19:07] right by the grace of God nothing you
[1:19:09] did but you just believe it anyhow you
[1:19:12] can't you can't help but believe it
[1:19:14] not that you put it there not that you
[1:19:15] made it happen not that you did anything
[1:19:17] yourself but you just can't help it I
[1:19:19] just believe it
[1:19:20] and I believe I'm a I see Gene of God an
[1:19:23] attribute of God a portion of God a
[1:19:25] portion of the word that he is
[1:19:27] designated for an expression in the very
[1:19:29] end time
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:33] so there's all kinds of seeds that can
[1:19:36] be planted if we think if you just think
[1:19:38] with me for a minute we can plant all
[1:19:40] kinds of vegetables and fruit seeds and
[1:19:41] and they all have seasons and they all
[1:19:43] have times that they come up and produce
[1:19:46] their fruit
[1:19:47] and so when God wanted a certain kind of
[1:19:49] harvest a certain kind of crop he
[1:19:51] planted a certain seed so he planted a
[1:19:53] certain seed in Paul's day spend a
[1:19:55] certain seed in Luther's day a certain
[1:19:57] seed was planted for Wesley's day amen
[1:19:59] but we weren't planted in those days
[1:20:02] there's a certain season of time and a
[1:20:05] certain seed to produce and bear a
[1:20:07] certain fruit in a certain season and
[1:20:09] God is the master gardener
[1:20:12] remember God started the Bible with a
[1:20:15] garden
[1:20:19] and in the end he takes his bride back
[1:20:21] to a garden
[1:20:23] the whole thing is about sowing seed
[1:20:27] bringing a harvest in return
[1:20:29] it's all about seed and harvest seed and
[1:20:31] fruit the whole Bible
[1:20:34] is a garden
[1:20:35] what is the bride a garden
[1:20:39] she's a garden enclosed the shut up a
[1:20:41] spring closed up
[1:20:43] she's a garden to her husband
[1:20:45] and so now The Gardener has planted the
[1:20:48] right seed for the right time and by
[1:20:50] predestination he knew what portion of
[1:20:52] himself would come forth In Your Vessel
[1:20:54] in this decreed season
[1:20:56] and so he knows that it's not an early
[1:20:59] spring Sun that'll bring the seed
[1:21:02] because it's not peace it's not snow
[1:21:03] peace
[1:21:05] it's not lettuce
[1:21:06] we're getting a later crop
[1:21:09] so he knows that it's going to take the
[1:21:11] full power of the sign to bring this
[1:21:14] seed to life
[1:21:16] so in this day he brought the full power
[1:21:19] of the word by the full revelation of
[1:21:21] the word because there was a seed in you
[1:21:23] that needed the full power of the light
[1:21:25] to be restored to bring this seed to
[1:21:28] life it was laying here couldn't spring
[1:21:30] forth under Luther's message couldn't
[1:21:31] spring forth under Wesley's visit but
[1:21:33] had to Spring forth under the light of
[1:21:35] the hour
[1:21:38] and that light that message that word
[1:21:42] and he says the words that I speak unto
[1:21:45] you their spirit in their life
[1:21:48] and so that Spirit of that word comes in
[1:21:51] and connects to the word laying in you
[1:21:54] and brings the word the seed word in you
[1:21:57] to life and then produces whatever that
[1:22:00] word is
[1:22:02] right amen that's why if we're a seed
[1:22:06] for this age we will not produce Luther
[1:22:08] life
[1:22:10] we will not produce Wesley life we will
[1:22:13] not produce Pentecost Pentecostal life
[1:22:17] but we will produce bright life
[1:22:19] because it's a bright scene
[1:22:22] and you have to say brother Ted will I
[1:22:24] produce bright Life by you know more
[1:22:25] effort I got more rules I now know
[1:22:30] I don't think it works like that
[1:22:33] in God's power to transform he says in
[1:22:35] everything under control
[1:22:37] to bring forth of its kind now remember
[1:22:39] to bring when he put the seed in the
[1:22:41] Earth the seed can only come forth with
[1:22:43] the power of life within it
[1:22:46] oh I hope you catch this
[1:22:49] I hope this breaks religion
[1:22:55] the sea can only come forth with the
[1:22:57] power of life within it
[1:23:00] to transform it from a seed to a plant
[1:23:06] or whatever it was
[1:23:07] his transforming power now God put the
[1:23:11] seed in there with potentials that it
[1:23:13] would be what he said it would be
[1:23:17] and as long as it stayed in its right
[1:23:19] category it would be just exactly what
[1:23:22] God said it would be it had to be that
[1:23:24] way because he had made it that way and
[1:23:26] made a channel that anything that stays
[1:23:28] in his channel in his line of word it
[1:23:31] will have to bring forth exactly like
[1:23:33] his word said it would do it cannot move
[1:23:35] from there it's channeled just exactly
[1:23:38] right so with everything in the trust in
[1:23:41] his own son
[1:23:43] that it would be that way then God said
[1:23:45] it's all good so I'll just rest and each
[1:23:47] one of those seeds has power
[1:23:50] in itself to transform itself into the
[1:23:54] species that I Desi that I desire it to
[1:23:57] be
[1:23:58] oh don't leave this in Genesis 1 2.
[1:24:03] bring it home
[1:24:05] you all raise your hand and said by
[1:24:06] Faith by the grace of God and by faith
[1:24:09] in that Grace you believe that you're a
[1:24:11] sieging of God predestinated for this
[1:24:12] hour amen then God already put the
[1:24:16] potential of what he wants it to be
[1:24:17] inside the gene
[1:24:20] not in your mind not in your will not in
[1:24:23] your mental power not in your strength
[1:24:25] the the the the to hold yourself back he
[1:24:28] put it in the gene amen a portion of
[1:24:31] himself a portion of word to be
[1:24:34] expressed this day amen and as long as
[1:24:36] we stay in the channel of the word
[1:24:38] laying in the presence of the sun amen
[1:24:41] as it continues to reveal itself it will
[1:24:43] bring all the potential out of the seed
[1:24:50] oh praise God
[1:24:56] this is me so much rest
[1:24:58] because I can't produce anything in my
[1:25:01] own power
[1:25:03] amen and so if I'm left in myself to be
[1:25:06] a bride I'm going to be the worst
[1:25:08] failure of bride there ever was but God
[1:25:10] did not leave it to me because he knew I
[1:25:13] would come shrouded in darkness clouded
[1:25:15] over with a mind alienated from God
[1:25:17] wrapped in hybrid flesh amen and he knew
[1:25:20] that I was going to come in that
[1:25:21] condition so he planted a seed inside of
[1:25:23] me and put the overcoming in the seed
[1:25:27] he didn't put it in my flash he didn't
[1:25:29] put in my mind he put it in the seed
[1:25:31] amen and then he's got a law amen and
[1:25:34] God's law always works when that
[1:25:36] germatized seed with life already and it
[1:25:38] comes in contact with the living word
[1:25:40] amen it'll spring forth the life and if
[1:25:42] it stays in that channel it'll pull out
[1:25:45] of it all the fruit that's already
[1:25:47] inside
[1:25:51] oh praise God
[1:25:53] brother tell you what why can't I
[1:25:55] overcome what do I have to do I'm
[1:25:57] telling you just stay in this word and
[1:25:59] let God wash away every form of religion
[1:26:02] and every idea of man and just keep
[1:26:04] feeding on the word it will bring life
[1:26:07] itself
[1:26:09] it'll just happen amen you'll look back
[1:26:11] at some point and say I I don't remember
[1:26:13] when I overcame that
[1:26:18] amen I can testify that of my life amen
[1:26:21] all of a sudden amen the word begins to
[1:26:24] do things I in willpower never was
[1:26:25] capable of doing myself but the word we
[1:26:28] just stay in the word and feed on the
[1:26:30] word and as he opens the word we rejoice
[1:26:32] in the word and stay in the presence of
[1:26:34] the word and then all of a sudden things
[1:26:36] begin to change amen and we grow but the
[1:26:39] growing is so gradual you don't really
[1:26:41] recognize it day by day
[1:26:46] and then at some point you look back and
[1:26:48] say
[1:26:50] I I am not struggling with that anymore
[1:26:55] when and then you go back I don't know
[1:26:57] if you've done this but I have when did
[1:27:00] it leave
[1:27:01] what was the moment what was there a
[1:27:05] prick in my heart that I have a
[1:27:06] sensation and
[1:27:08] no there's sometimes I cannot point when
[1:27:11] it left
[1:27:12] it just left
[1:27:13] some things just vanished and I can't
[1:27:15] tell you how some things left by degrees
[1:27:18] gradually slipping away losing its hold
[1:27:21] bit by bit
[1:27:22] then you find yourself having more
[1:27:24] Victory now I've had Victory all day now
[1:27:26] I've had Victory three days now I've had
[1:27:28] victory for a week my goodness I used to
[1:27:31] never be able to go an hour without this
[1:27:33] and never three hours I couldn't stop
[1:27:35] this thought from running through my
[1:27:36] head and now it's been a whole week
[1:27:42] and what's happening staying in the
[1:27:45] channel
[1:27:46] if that seed will stay in the proper
[1:27:49] Channel because God's laws work
[1:27:53] now listen
[1:27:55] if this seed will only flourish under
[1:27:57] the light of the age
[1:27:59] but I continually keep it from the light
[1:28:01] of the age
[1:28:03] and keep giving it to Satan's light of
[1:28:05] the age
[1:28:06] from the fourth dimension
[1:28:09] then I'm going to stunt the girls we're
[1:28:11] not going to get any more potentials out
[1:28:13] of it
[1:28:14] it doesn't change the plant
[1:28:17] it doesn't change the fact that the Son
[1:28:19] of God it doesn't change that the
[1:28:20] potentials are there but you can't
[1:28:23] you're out of the channel you can't
[1:28:25] produce the life
[1:28:27] so we're feeding on entertainments of
[1:28:29] the world and feeding on things of the
[1:28:30] world and wrong relationships and wrong
[1:28:32] conversations and we're not staying
[1:28:34] under
[1:28:36] the right atmosphere in the right
[1:28:38] Channel and then we're wondering why
[1:28:40] we're struggling to overcome so we're
[1:28:42] going to try harder but but the trying
[1:28:44] harder is not going to work
[1:28:46] can you might testify trying harder
[1:28:48] doesn't work
[1:28:49] praise God I'm glad I'm not all by
[1:28:50] myself
[1:28:51] because I tried harder and harder and
[1:28:53] then harder and harder and harder
[1:28:55] and the harder I tried the worse I fell
[1:29:00] so then so then having the the getting
[1:29:03] out of the channel will stop the growth
[1:29:07] will stop amen producing the potentials
[1:29:10] but will not change the plant
[1:29:17] that's why when you got discouraged and
[1:29:21] you backslid you never changed that you
[1:29:23] were a son of God
[1:29:25] and you may not have been producing any
[1:29:27] fruit and all of the leaves might have
[1:29:28] been falling off and your limbs might
[1:29:30] have been wilting down but in the root
[1:29:32] you were still Son of God and you
[1:29:34] couldn't change it because you didn't
[1:29:35] start it
[1:29:36] you didn't decide it you didn't choose
[1:29:39] it it was predestinated in the mind of
[1:29:41] God before the foundation of the world
[1:29:43] and you may be dried up and wilted and
[1:29:46] all your leaves laying down the fruits
[1:29:47] long gone the Bark's starting to come
[1:29:49] off but it doesn't change what you are
[1:29:51] and if you will just get in the fresh
[1:29:53] water of the word and under this bright
[1:29:55] August sunlight amen you'll find that
[1:29:58] the health will come back to the plant
[1:30:00] it'll spring back up again the limbs
[1:30:02] will raise up it'll put forth leaves
[1:30:04] buds flowers and then fruits
[1:30:07] but you're not going to do it in the
[1:30:09] wrong Channel trying to I'll get better
[1:30:12] and then come back
[1:30:16] you can't do it
[1:30:21] but the seed inside has all the
[1:30:24] potential to be everything he
[1:30:27] predestinated it to be
[1:30:30] so what do I do stay in the channel
[1:30:35] it doesn't do any good to stay in the
[1:30:36] channel and then pour dirty water over
[1:30:38] your plant all the time
[1:30:39] we've got to stay clean listen there's
[1:30:41] we have choices to make we get to make
[1:30:43] decisions and that decisions depends on
[1:30:45] our spiritual health we don't keep
[1:30:47] dumping dirty water on a plant we want
[1:30:49] to prosper but we stay under the Clean
[1:30:51] Water of the word and stay under the sun
[1:30:53] it's going to keep drawing potential
[1:30:55] potentials you didn't even know was
[1:30:57] laying there will start coming out if
[1:30:59] you stay in the right atmosphere
[1:31:02] it's a challenge for all of us amen
[1:31:04] we're stuck in this world we have to go
[1:31:06] to work we have associations we have
[1:31:07] things that we have to do we're
[1:31:09] bombarded by all kinds of things all the
[1:31:11] time but I want to take the challenge
[1:31:13] and I hope you take the challenge with
[1:31:14] me let's try to stay in the right
[1:31:17] Channel and see what God can do
[1:31:20] to stay on the right Channel
[1:31:22] stay in the right Fellowship hear the
[1:31:24] right things stay in the word amen feed
[1:31:27] on the word stay under the sun don't let
[1:31:29] the dirty water keep getting poured over
[1:31:31] don't move out from under the sunlight
[1:31:34] stay here and watch the potentials take
[1:31:38] off
[1:31:43] I love this I'm going to read this last
[1:31:44] sentence again because I just love it
[1:31:46] that's what it must be because I have
[1:31:48] given every seed
[1:31:50] transforming power
[1:31:56] every seed has within it transforming
[1:32:01] power
[1:32:05] it's not you living a Christian Life
[1:32:07] it's God in you living a Christian Life
[1:32:12] it's not you overcoming it's God in you
[1:32:14] overcome
[1:32:16] the life of the seed being expressed
[1:32:19] I've ever given everything transforming
[1:32:21] power to make out of itself in its
[1:32:24] potentials now to make out of itself
[1:32:26] exactly what I want it to be
[1:32:29] praise God
[1:32:31] let's turn to First Corinthians chapter
[1:32:33] 2 together
[1:32:35] read the scripture
[1:32:42] First Corinthians chapter 2.
[1:32:58] I hope we can get to the place as
[1:33:01] children of God
[1:33:03] till we're no longer basing our conduct
[1:33:07] on what people will think of us or what
[1:33:09] they will see
[1:33:12] and no longer basing our conduct on
[1:33:16] regulations and rules
[1:33:19] but that will begin to base our conduct
[1:33:21] on a free choice of that won't help me
[1:33:24] reach my potential
[1:33:27] that will harm the life that God's
[1:33:30] calling for that will stunt growth that
[1:33:33] will weaken the plan
[1:33:35] you see what I'm saying
[1:33:37] that won't be the proper expression of
[1:33:39] this life that the revelation of who we
[1:33:42] are amen brings the conduct in line not
[1:33:47] the fear of what somebody thinks but the
[1:33:49] revelation of Who We Are
[1:33:51] and then nobody has to watch you
[1:33:54] nobody has to follow you around nobody
[1:33:56] has to watch you nobody has to check on
[1:33:58] you nobody has to grab your phone and
[1:33:59] see what you've been looking at
[1:34:02] because you know that God put me here to
[1:34:05] manifest his life
[1:34:07] and he put within me everything that he
[1:34:09] wants to manifest and if I stay in the
[1:34:11] right atmosphere under the Holy Ghost
[1:34:13] under the word it'll pull out all that
[1:34:15] potentials and those things will hinder
[1:34:17] growth not help growth I'm not doing it
[1:34:20] those things will manifest the wrong
[1:34:22] life I can't I can't help somebody if
[1:34:24] I'm manifesting the wrong life if I'm
[1:34:25] claiming to be Christ and I'm showing
[1:34:27] something worldly in my attire in my
[1:34:29] dress my conduct my speech I'm hindering
[1:34:32] somebody else I'm not doing that because
[1:34:33] I know who I am
[1:34:35] not because somebody at church is going
[1:34:37] to no because I know who I am I'm not
[1:34:39] going to do that
[1:34:42] I I
[1:34:44] you know we've been together for a while
[1:34:45] now and you know me I I am not into
[1:34:48] loose living one drop
[1:34:50] but I believe the Revelation brings you
[1:34:52] to a higher life than you've ever been
[1:34:54] able to live before
[1:34:55] Holier cleaner amen because you because
[1:34:58] you understand who you are
[1:35:01] and God is giving strength from the seed
[1:35:04] to overcome
[1:35:06] and we're making those choices to keep
[1:35:09] strong not to weaken ourselves
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:14] so First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 6.
[1:35:18] albeit we speak wisdom among them that
[1:35:21] are perfect yet not the wisdom of this
[1:35:23] world nor the princes of this world that
[1:35:25] come to not
[1:35:26] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[1:35:29] mystery and darkness
[1:35:32] we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery
[1:35:34] even the hidden wisdom which God
[1:35:37] ordained before the world and to our
[1:35:39] Glory which none of the princes of this
[1:35:41] world knew for had they known it they
[1:35:43] would not have crucified the Lord of
[1:35:45] Glory
[1:35:46] but as it is written I have not seen nor
[1:35:48] ear heard neither entered into the heart
[1:35:50] of man the things which God hath
[1:35:51] prepared for them that love him but God
[1:35:54] hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:35:56] for the spirit searches all things yea
[1:35:58] the Deep things of God
[1:36:01] there are deep mysteries of God
[1:36:05] but we don't get them intellectually
[1:36:07] the spirit searches them out and brings
[1:36:10] them by revelation
[1:36:13] the spirit searches all things hey the
[1:36:14] Deep things of God for what man knoweth
[1:36:17] the things of a man say the spirit of a
[1:36:18] man which is in him even so the things
[1:36:20] of God knoweth no man but the spirit of
[1:36:22] God now we have received not the spirit
[1:36:25] of the world but the spirit which is of
[1:36:26] god that we might know the things that
[1:36:29] are freely given to us
[1:36:32] which things also we speak not in The
[1:36:34] Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but
[1:36:36] which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[1:36:39] spiritual things with spiritual but the
[1:36:41] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:36:43] the spirit of God for they are
[1:36:45] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[1:36:47] them because they are spiritually
[1:36:49] discerned
[1:36:51] God is bringing his word not to strike
[1:36:54] your head but to strike your soul
[1:36:58] comparing spiritual things with
[1:36:59] spiritual things Amen to bring you to a
[1:37:02] revelation and listen it's not just
[1:37:06] um
[1:37:07] it's not just God trying to bring you to
[1:37:09] a revelation
[1:37:10] of a Doctrine
[1:37:13] I hope we've grown past that
[1:37:16] God's not just trying to bring you to a
[1:37:18] revelation of a Doctrine
[1:37:21] but he's trying to bring you to the
[1:37:22] revelation of Who You Are
[1:37:25] this message came this message that this
[1:37:29] is just me now this is my synopsis and I
[1:37:32] know that if you make a synopsis you
[1:37:33] leave so much out and you can't
[1:37:35] minimalize stuff I understand that but
[1:37:36] just if I could from from what's in my
[1:37:38] heart just a synopsis I God didn't want
[1:37:42] me just to understand Doctrine
[1:37:44] because I could understand what happened
[1:37:46] in the garden and I could understand why
[1:37:49] it had to be blood at Calvary and I
[1:37:50] could understand why we baptized in
[1:37:52] Jesus name and all of that and at the
[1:37:54] end of all of my understanding I still
[1:37:56] don't know who I am
[1:38:00] what good was my understanding
[1:38:02] if I can go toe-to-toe with theologians
[1:38:05] and I can show scriptures and but I
[1:38:08] still don't know who I am
[1:38:11] what good did it do me
[1:38:14] the message didn't come
[1:38:17] to make us theologians
[1:38:20] although there's so much correct
[1:38:23] teaching and information amen there's so
[1:38:26] much correct teaching and understanding
[1:38:27] and there's nothing wrong with any of it
[1:38:29] but all the teaching is trying to get us
[1:38:31] to see the picture
[1:38:35] and if we miss the picture
[1:38:37] what good are the details
[1:38:42] the picture is Christ
[1:38:45] is the mystery of God revealed
[1:38:50] in this Bible is Christ
[1:38:54] and it was sealed up in darkness because
[1:38:58] of a lack of revelation of understanding
[1:39:01] what the real story within all the
[1:39:04] stories really was
[1:39:07] but in the end time God wanted to peel
[1:39:11] the seals off of this book to bring a
[1:39:13] revelation so that we could see
[1:39:15] something nobody else has ever seen
[1:39:18] before in the Bible
[1:39:21] so that we can see the real story of the
[1:39:26] Bible
[1:39:27] which is Christ male and female
[1:39:31] God redeeming his family becoming a
[1:39:35] family and living with his family on the
[1:39:38] Earth
[1:39:40] serpent seed helps me understand why I'm
[1:39:44] struggling in the flesh
[1:39:47] so that I can understand myself
[1:39:51] all the revelations are trying to get us
[1:39:54] to understand who we are and what the
[1:39:57] mystery that laid in the back part of
[1:39:59] God's mind was do you know what the back
[1:40:01] part of God's mind is it it is Darkness
[1:40:07] I can say because nobody's been able to
[1:40:10] see into it before
[1:40:11] it was shrouded in darkness amen this
[1:40:15] Bible has been the the truth of the word
[1:40:17] has been laying in the shadows
[1:40:23] foreign
[1:40:26] but in the end time
[1:40:29] he brings a light to reveal what's in
[1:40:31] the shadows he takes the seals off to
[1:40:33] show what's been what's been behind the
[1:40:35] cloud what's been in the darkness of the
[1:40:38] back part of his mind oh praise be to
[1:40:41] God
[1:40:41] I hope I hope that this can hit home
[1:40:44] amen it's more than Doctrine it's more
[1:40:46] than regulated it's it's it's God trying
[1:40:48] to get us to understand who we are
[1:40:50] because everything we do is based on
[1:40:54] what we believe
[1:40:57] you can see people's conduct all the
[1:40:59] time amen they claim to have tremendous
[1:41:02] Faith but anything goes wrong amen they
[1:41:04] lose it I mean they fall apart they need
[1:41:06] everybody in the world to pray for them
[1:41:07] amen they don't know if they're going to
[1:41:09] make it through and
[1:41:11] but you said you had tremendous faith
[1:41:14] then why at the first bump you you
[1:41:15] completely lose it
[1:41:19] amen
[1:41:21] God wants us to have real faith
[1:41:23] genuine Faith by coming into the
[1:41:26] revelation of who we really are
[1:41:28] who we really are
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:32] amen I'm just going to go to a couple
[1:41:34] more places and then we'll
[1:41:35] we'll wind down first Thessalonians 5 4
[1:41:39] believe Brethren are not in darkness
[1:41:43] that that day should overtake you as a
[1:41:45] thief ye are the children of light and
[1:41:49] the children of the day we are not of
[1:41:51] the night nor of Darkness
[1:41:55] I was born in a dark condition but I am
[1:41:57] a child of light by predestination
[1:42:00] if my father is light
[1:42:02] we've been through this before
[1:42:05] if light has Offspring they must be
[1:42:10] light
[1:42:12] if he is light his children will be
[1:42:14] light
[1:42:15] if he is love his children will be loved
[1:42:19] that's what God wants us to be
[1:42:23] amen
[1:42:25] Daniel says
[1:42:27] after he gets the revelation of the
[1:42:29] dream of Nebuchadnezzar he says then was
[1:42:31] the secret revealed unto Daniel and a
[1:42:33] night vision then Daniel blessed the god
[1:42:34] of Heaven Daniel answered and said
[1:42:36] blessed be the name of God forever and
[1:42:38] ever for wisdom and might are his and he
[1:42:41] changes the times and the seasons he
[1:42:44] removeth Kings instead of up Kings he
[1:42:46] giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[1:42:47] knowledge to them that no understanding
[1:42:49] he revealeth the deep and secret things
[1:42:53] he knows what is in the darkness and the
[1:42:56] light dwelleth with him
[1:43:01] Revelations 10 we're not going to go
[1:43:03] there and read all of it we've read it
[1:43:05] over and over you know Revelation 10 1-7
[1:43:07] but in Revelation 10 1-7 there's
[1:43:10] something that's left in darkness
[1:43:14] and that's the seven Thunders
[1:43:17] John heard seven Thunders utter their
[1:43:19] voices and he was picking up his pen to
[1:43:21] write and he heard a voice from heaven
[1:43:23] and said write not the thing that the
[1:43:26] seven Thunders uttered
[1:43:28] but seal them up
[1:43:29] what does that mean something in
[1:43:31] Revelations 10 is shrouded in darkness
[1:43:36] it's laying in darkness it's laying in
[1:43:38] the back part of God's mind amen it's a
[1:43:41] mystery that needs to be revealed amen
[1:43:43] and it's it's in darkness
[1:43:48] where does God dwell in the thick
[1:43:50] Darkness
[1:43:51] is that what Solomon said he dwells in
[1:43:54] the thick Darkness
[1:43:55] the thick Darkness so thick you can't
[1:43:58] see into it so thick no Theologian no
[1:44:01] minister no church age messenger so
[1:44:03] thick nobody's been able to see that
[1:44:05] before
[1:44:08] but God
[1:44:10] is going to peel back the darkness
[1:44:12] he's going to show that the light is in
[1:44:16] the Darkness
[1:44:17] the light of this age is in the darkness
[1:44:20] of Revelation 10.
[1:44:23] the unwritten part of the word
[1:44:26] has the light
[1:44:28] that we need to overcome in this day
[1:44:33] and the message it is the rising of the
[1:44:35] Sun
[1:44:36] brother Brandon was talking about Junior
[1:44:37] Jackson's dream and in junior Jackson's
[1:44:39] dream he sees a great pyramid with with
[1:44:42] writing all around the outside of the
[1:44:44] pyramid
[1:44:45] and brother Branham means walking around
[1:44:47] the pyramid and he's interpreting the
[1:44:49] writing on the outside of the pyramid
[1:44:53] and so
[1:44:55] I'm going back because you guys are
[1:44:56] reading
[1:44:57] cheaters cheaters cheaters
[1:45:04] we need to pray
[1:45:10] he's walking around this pyramid
[1:45:12] interpreting the writing
[1:45:14] and this is Brother Brennan tying
[1:45:16] together all the Loose Ends
[1:45:18] restoring all the Lost doctrines that
[1:45:20] were lost to the church ages bringing us
[1:45:22] back Amen to the to the apostolic
[1:45:25] teaching
[1:45:28] and he goes around and after he's done
[1:45:30] going around interpreting all the
[1:45:33] writing on the outside
[1:45:35] that's what you could read
[1:45:39] does that make sense that was the
[1:45:41] writing on the outside
[1:45:43] Brother Bear talks about seal Seven
[1:45:45] Seals on the inside seals on the back
[1:45:47] side of the book and it can get super
[1:45:48] confusing if we don't just catch the big
[1:45:50] picture because the big picture's simple
[1:45:52] amen
[1:45:53] the terminology you can go is it inside
[1:45:55] is an outside backside front side west
[1:45:57] side what brother Branham is saying is
[1:45:59] there was some seals that was open in
[1:46:01] the book and they opened in symbol form
[1:46:03] when the lamb took the book and opened
[1:46:04] the seals and a white horse went riding
[1:46:06] that was an open seal you could read it
[1:46:08] and see it
[1:46:10] but there were seven other seals which
[1:46:12] was the mystery of the seven Thunders
[1:46:13] that John was told not to write and see
[1:46:15] a love that's the seals on the inside of
[1:46:17] the backside or whatever side brother
[1:46:19] Benham uses at that time he's showing
[1:46:21] that there's other parts of this mystery
[1:46:23] that have not been revealed yet
[1:46:29] and so he goes what what you can read he
[1:46:31] goes around and begins to interpret all
[1:46:33] the writing and restores the doctrine of
[1:46:36] serpent seed and the godhead and water
[1:46:38] baptism and predestination and all of
[1:46:41] these things he brings back the true
[1:46:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost and all of
[1:46:45] these things
[1:46:46] but then in the dream it says then you
[1:46:48] picked up something like from the air
[1:46:50] something like a Wrecking Bar crowbar
[1:46:51] wasn't it brother something like that A
[1:46:53] Wrecking Bar real sharp said how it done
[1:46:56] and I don't know it said you struck the
[1:46:58] top of the mountain ripped it around
[1:47:00] lifted the capital off and it was the
[1:47:03] shape of a pyramid and you rip the top
[1:47:05] of it off now that was months and months
[1:47:07] before the pyramid message was preached
[1:47:09] and said beneath that was White Stone
[1:47:11] Granite and you said the Sun or the
[1:47:15] light has never shined on this before
[1:47:19] it's part of the Bible that's never seen
[1:47:22] the light of day it's been in darkness
[1:47:26] on the inside of the pyramid which is
[1:47:28] the word amen inside this word something
[1:47:31] was in darkness
[1:47:37] brother Chad how can you say a thing
[1:47:38] like that
[1:47:39] it's the Bible Hey listen when it's not
[1:47:42] revealed it's dark to you
[1:47:45] it's still in darkness when you can't
[1:47:47] see it it's still in darkness It's
[1:47:48] Shouting the darkness it's laying right
[1:47:50] there amen remember when brother Branham
[1:47:51] said somebody told him amen you could
[1:47:53] write another book of the Bible or you
[1:47:55] can give us the interpretation of seven
[1:47:56] Thunder he said no I can't you can't add
[1:47:58] one word or take one word away it's got
[1:48:01] to be something that's already written
[1:48:02] here
[1:48:03] but if it's something that's written
[1:48:05] here already but brother Branham didn't
[1:48:07] know what it was then it was shrouded to
[1:48:09] him he was in darkness to what the
[1:48:11] Revelation was
[1:48:13] and tell the angel Lord came day by day
[1:48:15] and gave him the Revelation then he
[1:48:17] peeled back sealed by Seal and opened it
[1:48:20] up so that he could see so that word
[1:48:22] wasn't something added it was something
[1:48:24] laying there in the Darkness
[1:48:26] in our Bibles
[1:48:31] that's why printing billions of Bibles
[1:48:34] is not going to change the world Amen
[1:48:36] because this is the season for the
[1:48:38] unveiling of the written word
[1:48:45] praise God
[1:48:47] that's why Bible school won't do us any
[1:48:49] good because it can't reveal to you
[1:48:51] what was
[1:48:53] in the mountain
[1:48:56] it can't reveal to you the part that
[1:48:59] light has never shined on this part
[1:49:01] before
[1:49:05] and the sign of the inserts he says and
[1:49:08] look and he said look upon this light
[1:49:11] has never come upon it before
[1:49:14] this part White Stone
[1:49:18] granted with no writing on it
[1:49:24] why is there no writing on the stone
[1:49:26] it's a revelation that's contained
[1:49:28] within the mountain there's no writing
[1:49:30] on the stone but no light has never ever
[1:49:32] shined on this before but it's going to
[1:49:34] give you a revelation what is the
[1:49:36] Revelation listen you can't write
[1:49:38] anything on the stone whatever is
[1:49:40] written has to be written on the outside
[1:49:41] of the stone but not revealed till the
[1:49:43] Top's taken off
[1:49:46] and then when light shines on this it's
[1:49:49] aha I understand
[1:49:54] he said and remember their third pool
[1:49:57] was the opening of them Seven Seals to
[1:50:00] reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:50:01] sealed in the word
[1:50:04] what was it it was in darkness laying
[1:50:07] there in Revelations 10 1.
[1:50:09] it was in darkness but it had already
[1:50:11] been written but no light had ever shown
[1:50:13] on this Revelation before
[1:50:15] but God used the prophet Amen to take
[1:50:19] the Capstone off to show us amen that
[1:50:21] that there's a mystery laying in this
[1:50:23] word amen this great mystery is the
[1:50:26] greatest of mysteries it's Revelation 10
[1:50:29] 7. it's the mystery of God all through
[1:50:32] this Bible God was coming God was
[1:50:34] manifesting God was revealing and he was
[1:50:37] coming through the prophets and he was
[1:50:38] coming through the patriarch he was
[1:50:40] coming through the law until he came as
[1:50:42] Jesus Christ
[1:50:45] and he was all the prophets and all the
[1:50:47] laws and all the Psalms and it was all
[1:50:48] of it together amen what is it it's the
[1:50:51] Great White Stone in the middle of this
[1:50:52] book it's all about him coming
[1:50:55] the seventh seal
[1:50:58] and he came as a man amen and that man
[1:51:01] was the last Adam to restore all that
[1:51:03] Adam lost and that last Adam was going
[1:51:05] to have a bride just like the first one
[1:51:07] had a bride but that bride had to come
[1:51:09] out of himself amen where do you get
[1:51:11] this brother Ted it's in the white stone
[1:51:13] inside the Bible
[1:51:16] where do you feel so I find that written
[1:51:18] I find they're written in Genesis
[1:51:19] chapter 2. I find it written in Genesis
[1:51:21] chapter 3. I find it written on the
[1:51:23] outside but the revelations on the
[1:51:25] inside
[1:51:27] and until this day light has never
[1:51:30] shined upon this before
[1:51:34] and through the New Testament he was
[1:51:35] coming
[1:51:37] he was coming
[1:51:38] snitting off the original coming
[1:51:41] building a bride until he brings a
[1:51:45] statue of a bride in the end time
[1:51:47] through and elect people upon the Earth
[1:51:48] to manifest bride
[1:51:51] and unite The Head and the body together
[1:51:54] as one to finish the work of redemption
[1:51:57] to manifest himself in Bride form a
[1:52:00] perfect bride perfectly submitted to the
[1:52:02] headship to finish the work he left for
[1:52:04] this day so that God can prove bruise
[1:52:07] Satan under your feet
[1:52:09] to finish the prophecy of Revelation or
[1:52:13] Genesis 3
[1:52:14] thy see shall bruise his head
[1:52:17] he's going to finish it through bride
[1:52:21] and then when he's finished it he's
[1:52:23] going to pluck her away to a married
[1:52:25] supper we finished Redeeming the Jews
[1:52:27] burn the Earth and bring us back to an
[1:52:29] eating condition
[1:52:33] what is that brother Chad
[1:52:35] that's the great mystery of God
[1:52:39] that Christ is the mystery of God and
[1:52:43] Christ is revealing himself as the
[1:52:46] manifested word for the day
[1:52:51] in that revelation
[1:52:54] shows you who you really are
[1:52:58] that Revelation come at this end time
[1:53:01] take away doubts not to create doubts
[1:53:06] this message I I hope to God that God
[1:53:10] will help me never to preach it in such
[1:53:12] a way that it creates doubt because this
[1:53:15] message is supposed to take away doubt
[1:53:20] I mean we as human beings we can't
[1:53:22] always keep it straight so I pray God
[1:53:23] forgives me but I believe the heart of
[1:53:26] the message is come to identify a bride
[1:53:29] because that Prophet was here to point
[1:53:32] to a word born bride
[1:53:35] and she will be pointed to the skies by
[1:53:39] the same Prophet at the coming of the
[1:53:40] Lord and say Behold the Lamb of God who
[1:53:42] takes away the sins of the world
[1:53:44] and he brings the two together
[1:53:49] so that we don't have to walk around and
[1:53:51] say which interpretation is Right which
[1:53:54] scripture is right when is it the
[1:53:56] Catholic is the Baptist is this what do
[1:53:57] I have to do to earn it and what steps
[1:53:59] do I have to take amen the only thing
[1:54:01] you have to do is come to the revelation
[1:54:03] of this hour and say son
[1:54:06] germanized bring life out of the seed
[1:54:10] I'm here Lord I recognize this is it
[1:54:13] this is the light this is everything and
[1:54:15] I believe by faith that inside of me is
[1:54:17] that seed Lord I'm just laying here and
[1:54:19] I'm letting you do what you promised
[1:54:25] take away fear take away scare take away
[1:54:28] all the Ridiculousness of trying human
[1:54:32] efforts
[1:54:34] and just stay in the Revelation and let
[1:54:36] the Revelation produce what it was
[1:54:38] always intended to produce
[1:54:40] a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:54:43] trust in him who trusts the word and is
[1:54:46] confident if she stays in the channel he
[1:54:50] will do all the work
[1:54:52] he will do all the work where will he do
[1:54:56] it he'll do it through you but you won't
[1:54:58] do it he'll do it you just surrender and
[1:55:00] he'll come and do it
[1:55:02] amen what a trust
[1:55:04] we can have
[1:55:07] Amen brother Ben said that's the day
[1:55:10] we're living in right now
[1:55:12] the light will shine just at the evening
[1:55:14] when the darkness is setting in
[1:55:20] you know
[1:55:21] Darkness creeped in
[1:55:24] to God's Eden
[1:55:26] but now in Satan's Eden when the world's
[1:55:29] in total chaos and darkness
[1:55:32] who believes the world's in complete
[1:55:34] darkness
[1:55:37] do you do you still believe God dwells
[1:55:39] in the midst of the darkness
[1:55:44] this world is in darkness
[1:55:48] religious Darkness
[1:55:51] but he still dwells in the thick
[1:55:54] Darkness
[1:55:55] because he's living in a bride in his
[1:55:58] body in a people in Satan's Eden
[1:56:05] brother Ben says in power to transform
[1:56:07] it's all wrong not people it's the
[1:56:09] program that's wrong and now what's it
[1:56:11] done it's all headed up again and
[1:56:13] brought the whole entire world through a
[1:56:16] bunch of hybriding perversion of the
[1:56:17] Original Seed of God to another darkened
[1:56:20] chaos
[1:56:22] but I'm so glad that God is mindful of
[1:56:25] us again that he can still move upon the
[1:56:28] face of the condition he goes right back
[1:56:31] to Genesis 1 2.
[1:56:33] he promised he would do it and call a
[1:56:35] little flock which would be his bride
[1:56:40] hey there's Darkness over the face of
[1:56:43] the Earth
[1:56:44] but the Holy Ghost is still brooding
[1:56:46] to bring those seeds up out of the
[1:56:49] darkness
[1:56:52] this is a familiar scripture out of
[1:56:54] Colossians 1 even the mystery which has
[1:56:55] been hid from ages and from Generations
[1:56:57] but now is made manifest to his Saints
[1:57:00] to whom God would make known was The
[1:57:02] Riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:57:04] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:57:06] you the hope of glory
[1:57:11] Glory the Easter seal at the beginning
[1:57:13] broke the Seal of the Roman seal the
[1:57:15] Easter seal that he was sealed up and
[1:57:17] man when they died was gone but he broke
[1:57:20] the seal and revealed the secret and now
[1:57:22] God by his holy spirit has broke the
[1:57:24] seal from around our lives
[1:57:28] and Christ is revealed as he lives in US
[1:57:34] for now we are quickened
[1:57:36] with him
[1:57:40] everyone says in things that are to be
[1:57:43] now if we are those attributes of God
[1:57:46] we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live
[1:57:48] by denominationalism we must live by the
[1:57:51] word
[1:57:52] because the bride is part of the
[1:57:54] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[1:57:55] husband therefore we must be that word
[1:57:57] bride and what is the word bride the
[1:57:59] manifestation of this hour
[1:58:02] the bride not a Creed or a denomination
[1:58:03] but a living Oracle of God a living
[1:58:05] attribute of God displaying to the world
[1:58:08] the attributes of God and the formation
[1:58:10] of the Bride that's to be expressed in
[1:58:12] this hour that we're now living
[1:58:15] where was that brother Chad
[1:58:18] that was what was revealed in the Rock
[1:58:21] in the rock
[1:58:23] the word within the word
[1:58:27] the great darkness in that darkness that
[1:58:30] unrevealed part of the word in that
[1:58:32] Darkness
[1:58:34] and now God has peeled away the darkness
[1:58:37] and he's shining that light amen not
[1:58:39] everybody sees it in light to some it's
[1:58:41] still Darkness
[1:58:43] you tell them about the bride coming of
[1:58:45] Christ and who this is and where Christ
[1:58:47] is in this day amen and who is United
[1:58:49] himself with it's still Darkness because
[1:58:51] all they see is people from Nazareth
[1:58:56] they still see people from Nazareth or
[1:58:58] maybe worse people from Lima
[1:59:01] it may have a worse reputation I don't
[1:59:03] know
[1:59:04] all they see is people with Lima amen
[1:59:07] they they see Darkness but in the
[1:59:09] darkness is God finishing his word
[1:59:12] finishing his work
[1:59:14] if we could approach unto the darkness
[1:59:16] we could find God
[1:59:18] and not run away and not be afraid but
[1:59:21] approach unto the thick Darkness that's
[1:59:24] you're just human beings how could you
[1:59:25] be a select elect group of people how
[1:59:27] could you be Christ how could Christ be
[1:59:29] living you you're just normal and you
[1:59:31] were born like I was born you work where
[1:59:32] I work and you it's say listen that's
[1:59:34] thick Darkness get beyond the thick
[1:59:36] Darkness
[1:59:37] don't be afraid of the thick Darkness
[1:59:39] that's just my old cockoverness that's
[1:59:42] just my old hybrid amen but down inside
[1:59:44] is another life it's Christ Living
[1:59:47] himself out
[1:59:50] it's the revelation
[1:59:52] of the hour
[1:59:58] brother Venom
[2:00:00] he showed a picture of a cloud
[2:00:04] that cloud is Darkness to some
[2:00:09] but to me it's light
[2:00:13] to some that's a great mystery that's
[2:00:15] still mysterious and still scary
[2:00:18] to talk about scary to recognize the
[2:00:21] implications of what that means
[2:00:24] but brother Branham one time in the
[2:00:25] service took that took that
[2:00:28] picture of a cloud and he turned it to
[2:00:30] the right
[2:00:31] and he said that's our Lord up there
[2:00:35] showing that the Lord had returned to
[2:00:38] unite with his bride the church
[2:00:41] you know what to some that's still
[2:00:43] shrouded in darkness the seven steel is
[2:00:45] still a mystery
[2:00:48] but to me it's light
[2:00:50] it's not anything to run away from it's
[2:00:52] not anything to move off the mountain
[2:00:53] from but God Amen was thundering from
[2:00:56] this mountain with this great Revelation
[2:00:57] and it's so mysterious and it it's so
[2:01:00] overwhelming to think that that's
[2:01:02] actually true that it looks so
[2:01:04] impossible and so dark with Thunders and
[2:01:06] Lightnings and flashes of light and
[2:01:08] thick Darkness amen that everybody runs
[2:01:10] away but there was a predestinated one
[2:01:12] in that day that didn't run away he went
[2:01:14] into what was scary
[2:01:19] and by the grace of God he has put
[2:01:22] something in us that can move into what
[2:01:24] scares away millions of people
[2:01:28] and what did we find behind all the
[2:01:32] scare
[2:01:34] we found the light
[2:01:37] the Revelation the reality of the word
[2:01:40] where was it it was shrouded in the
[2:01:43] confusion around the seventh seal and
[2:01:46] the confusion around the coming of the
[2:01:48] Lord and the confusion around all this
[2:01:49] there was such Darkness such such fear
[2:01:51] so many would run away amen but by the
[2:01:54] grace of God he pulled us and he pulled
[2:01:56] us and he pulled us and when we broke
[2:01:57] into the darkness we found this is light
[2:02:01] for he dwells in the thick
[2:02:06] we don't want to be afraid of the
[2:02:09] revelation of the hour
[2:02:11] we want to move in
[2:02:13] up and in
[2:02:16] brother Brown says in things that are to
[2:02:18] be
[2:02:19] so now the
[2:02:21] only way that you can be a son or a
[2:02:23] daughter of God
[2:02:24] because you have to have eternal life
[2:02:27] and there's only one form of eternal
[2:02:29] life and that's God's life
[2:02:31] so you have to have eternal life and
[2:02:33] there's only one form that's God's life
[2:02:35] so what's in you
[2:02:37] God's life
[2:02:40] see how this Revelation is to take away
[2:02:42] all the scare how can you say I hope I
[2:02:45] make the Rapture how can you say I hope
[2:02:46] to make the Rapture if you have a
[2:02:48] revelation your bride
[2:02:50] if you have a revelation your bride you
[2:02:53] can't miss the Rapture amen just like
[2:02:55] our brother rashan said you are the
[2:02:56] rapture
[2:02:58] the Rapture is taking place in you now
[2:03:00] as it's lifted you out of
[2:03:02] denominationalism and Rose to church out
[2:03:04] of deadness and brought it back to life
[2:03:05] to its original condition
[2:03:08] so the rapture's going on in you how can
[2:03:10] you miss the rapture
[2:03:12] so you see we sabotage ourselves by
[2:03:15] things that come out of our mouth amen
[2:03:17] the Revelation if you're a bride if
[2:03:19] there's only one form of eternal life
[2:03:20] that's God and that's the life that's in
[2:03:21] you then God is in you
[2:03:25] how are you going to fail
[2:03:26] how are you gonna miss the Rapture how
[2:03:28] are you going to be deceived how are you
[2:03:30] not going to make it how are you going
[2:03:30] to not know
[2:03:32] you may not know everything now and you
[2:03:34] may not know the hour the next event
[2:03:36] will transpire you may not have
[2:03:37] intellectual understanding but the god
[2:03:39] that's in you will lead you all the way
[2:03:41] that life that's in you was meant to
[2:03:43] overcome in this age and to flourish and
[2:03:45] to manifest in this hour
[2:03:48] you're not going to miss it you're not
[2:03:49] going to be left behind you're not going
[2:03:51] to be confused you're not going to be
[2:03:52] deceived
[2:03:54] God is going to manifest himself through
[2:03:57] these seeds
[2:04:00] so he goes on to say they're there to be
[2:04:03] a Son of God you had to be in him
[2:04:06] always
[2:04:09] and the gene of your life spiritual life
[2:04:11] tonight was in God the Father before
[2:04:13] there was even a molecule and you are
[2:04:15] nothing but the manifestation of the
[2:04:17] gene of life that was in God as the son
[2:04:19] of God
[2:04:21] you see how the message was not here to
[2:04:24] bring form and ritual
[2:04:26] the message is not here to bring scare
[2:04:28] the message is not here to bring
[2:04:30] confusion the message is here to bring a
[2:04:32] life
[2:04:37] it says now
[2:04:39] I want to read that last sentence again
[2:04:40] and you're nothing but the manifestation
[2:04:41] of the gene of life that was in God as a
[2:04:43] Son of God and now you're expressed
[2:04:46] after his word has come in you to light
[2:04:49] up this age
[2:04:51] what are you to do light up this age
[2:04:54] what age is it the darkest age there's
[2:04:57] ever been is shining the brightest
[2:04:58] lights
[2:05:01] there's a light in this present darkness
[2:05:03] and it's shining through the manifested
[2:05:06] word for the day which is the Bride of
[2:05:09] Jesus Christ
[2:05:11] now you're expressed after his word has
[2:05:12] come in you to light up this age you're
[2:05:14] expressing God's life in you because you
[2:05:16] are a son or daughter of God therefore
[2:05:18] you get what I mean see you are now made
[2:05:22] you're sitting in this church tonight
[2:05:23] because your duty is to express God to
[2:05:26] this nation and this people in this
[2:05:27] neighborhood where you associate
[2:05:30] wherever you are God knew that you would
[2:05:32] be here because you have to be one of
[2:05:34] his genes or his attributes you had to
[2:05:36] be if you ever if you've got eternal
[2:05:39] life then it was always was eternal life
[2:05:41] and gone before there was a foundation
[2:05:43] of the world knew that you would be here
[2:05:45] and when the word or the water the
[2:05:47] washing of the water of the word fell
[2:05:49] upon you it was expressed in a being
[2:05:53] and that is who I am
[2:05:58] oh the Chad Lamb that was so many years
[2:06:01] ago he was a rascal
[2:06:04] born wrong born through sex desire
[2:06:07] coming to the world speaking lies
[2:06:09] shrouded in darkness overshadowed by
[2:06:12] death all of those things but praise God
[2:06:14] I'm not identifying with that one I'm
[2:06:16] identifying with the original that God
[2:06:18] thought God had of me before the
[2:06:20] foundation in the world and that's the
[2:06:22] seed down on the inside and that's who I
[2:06:25] really am
[2:06:27] and all the potential is already there
[2:06:32] if I can just stay in the channel it'll
[2:06:35] come out
[2:06:36] and let's all stand musicians if you'll
[2:06:38] come please
[2:06:46] Jesus said I'm the light of the world
[2:06:48] he that hath me
[2:06:50] who no longer walk in darkness
[2:06:53] for us the darkness is faded away
[2:06:57] this world is shrouded in darkness
[2:06:59] laodicea is gone and laodicea has gone
[2:07:02] into a total blackout complete apostasy
[2:07:05] but to me it's the rising of the Sun
[2:07:09] it's a bright shiny day it's shalom it's
[2:07:12] good morning it's praise God the
[2:07:15] darkness upon the Earth but light has
[2:07:17] sprung
[2:07:19] amen let me read this last scripture in
[2:07:23] Isaiah 61-3 arise Shine for thy lightest
[2:07:27] come and the Lord glory of the Lord has
[2:07:30] risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness
[2:07:32] shall cover the Earth in Gross Darkness
[2:07:34] to people but the Lord shall arise upon
[2:07:36] thee in his glory shall be seen upon
[2:07:39] thee and the Gentile shall come to thy
[2:07:42] light and Kings to the brightness of
[2:07:45] Rising
[2:07:47] it is the rising of the Sun
[2:07:51] God bless you all
[2:07:52] amen you have a song brother
[2:08:00] hell walking

[2:09:26] T Shepard turned in a prayer request
[2:09:28] this morning for his wife who's in ICU
[2:09:31] her name's Melissa Melissa requested
[2:09:34] that we that a prayer cloth be brought
[2:09:37] to her so we have a cloth here I've wore
[2:09:39] it with me while I was preaching and I'm
[2:09:41] going to pray for it I'm going to ask
[2:09:42] that we all bow our heads together we'll
[2:09:44] pray as we thank God for the word and
[2:09:46] we'll ask God to bless our sister's
[2:09:49] Faith she has faith in the word of God
[2:09:51] and she has faith in Acts 19 because
[2:09:54] this is the scripture brother Ben quoted
[2:09:55] over and over when he sent out prayer
[2:09:57] Clause Acts 19 12 so that from his body
[2:10:00] we're brought into the sick
[2:10:01] handkerchiefs and aprons and the
[2:10:03] diseases departed from them and evil
[2:10:05] spirits went out of them
[2:10:07] we believe if we come by the same faith
[2:10:09] that Melissa's already expressed her
[2:10:11] faith in this scripture by asking for a
[2:10:13] prayer call
[2:10:14] if we can agree with her in faith we
[2:10:16] believe God will keep an honor his word
[2:10:18] and honor her faith so let's bow our
[2:10:20] heads together
[2:10:22] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[2:10:24] Jesus for this word that you have given
[2:10:26] us Lord
[2:10:28] God it's so amazing what you have done
[2:10:31] in our day I don't believe we've fully
[2:10:33] grasped the fool
[2:10:36] scope of what you have done in this
[2:10:38] generation
[2:10:39] Lord when you
[2:10:41] when you revealed the hidden Mystery
[2:10:45] when you revealed the great mystery that
[2:10:49] you had in the back part of your mind
[2:10:51] and unfolded it into three folds
[2:10:54] brother you would send the man
[2:10:56] from Kentucky with a seventh grade
[2:10:58] education and no theology
[2:11:02] look to others like Darkness
[2:11:05] but to us when we approached unto that
[2:11:07] we found the life
[2:11:09] we found the true Revelation on the word
[2:11:12] the great mystery you had in the back
[2:11:14] part of your mind this message that has
[2:11:17] scared so many people Lord to us it's
[2:11:19] light
[2:11:21] it's no longer Darkness or a scary thing
[2:11:23] but it's light Lord It's the
[2:11:25] illumination that we need to walk in
[2:11:27] this hour
[2:11:28] oh God we're so thankful that you put a
[2:11:31] seed inside of us
[2:11:33] that could receive your word so thankful
[2:11:36] that you brewed it over Us by the Holy
[2:11:38] Ghost to bring the light to us
[2:11:40] Quicken us to life
[2:11:42] well we could have never done this on
[2:11:44] our own but you did it for us
[2:11:47] and God we're thankful I pray Lord that
[2:11:49] the word that was preached would strike
[2:11:51] the hearts of your children and bring
[2:11:53] forth a Bountiful Harvest
[2:11:55] may we God move away Lord from all the
[2:11:58] things that deter us and distract us and
[2:12:00] hurt us may we stay Lord in the channel
[2:12:03] that brings Greater Life
[2:12:06] may we rely Lord on your word and the
[2:12:08] promise in your word and may it bring
[2:12:09] out of us all the potentials that lay
[2:12:12] inside your seed
[2:12:14] God I pray to go with your people as we
[2:12:16] part
[2:12:17] icularly we want to agree together for
[2:12:20] the healing of our sister Melissa
[2:12:21] Shepherd

[2:12:25] and request
[2:12:27] Lord that that fabric we brought to her
[2:12:30] that a piece of garment just like they
[2:12:32] brought from the body of Paul

[2:12:37] preached your gospel under your
[2:12:38] anointing
[2:12:40] well we're we're living in the
[2:12:42] scriptures
[2:12:43] we want to see them alive all around us
[2:12:46] God I pray that you would honor our
[2:12:48] sisters Faith as we stand with our
[2:12:50] agreement
[2:12:51] that Lord when this cloth comes to her
[2:12:54] that the sicknesses the diseases will
[2:12:56] depart in evil spirits will leave
[2:12:58] may you heal her may we hear the
[2:13:00] testimony of her healing Lord
[2:13:02] we love you and we thank you for the
[2:13:04] promises you've given us in your word
[2:13:07] may you go with us this day and may we
[2:13:09] be light in the Darkness
[2:13:12] and the Darkness of Satan's eating in
[2:13:13] the darkness of laodicea may we be
[2:13:16] bright in shining lights we love you God
[2:13:20] and we ask for your help
