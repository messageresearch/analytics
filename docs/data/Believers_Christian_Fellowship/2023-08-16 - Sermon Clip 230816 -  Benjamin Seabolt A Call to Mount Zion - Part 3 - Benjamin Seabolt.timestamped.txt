[0:00] in the spirit land what you are
[0:04] there's the answer to the devil's
[0:06] question
[0:09] Saints if you are a child of God in the
[0:12] spirit land you tell me what power on
[0:15] Earth is going to change that and what
[0:17] trial and tribulation that you're going
[0:19] to face this week next week or a month
[0:21] from now is going to change that what
[0:24] overcoming power that should deliver to
[0:26] us I'll say it as brother Branham says
[0:28] the reason we find ourselves so stooped
[0:30] shoulders and our head down and are
[0:31] drooping in the mumbles and the grumbles
[0:33] and the cries and complaints he says
[0:35] because you've not been tuned into that
[0:38] and there's only one way to get tuned
[0:40] into that if you want free from the
[0:42] laodicean spirits there's one way and
[0:44] that's to get tuned into the message of
[0:46] this hour because it's the only Channel
[0:48] that's going to explain this to you and
[0:49] break this down for you and give you the
[0:51] answer to the devil's question
[0:54] if not you better go ahead and make an
[0:55] appointment with the psychiatrist
[0:58] because the mental oppression and the
[1:00] mental plagues that are coming upon this
[1:02] world and especially this nation you
[1:04] will not be able to stand
[1:06] there is only one thing that's going to
[1:08] stand that shaking
[1:09] and that's the message of this hour in
[1:11] your soul
[1:15] and God has been so gracious to come and
[1:17] tell us these things
[1:19] what you are
[1:22] no chance to that that is settled that
[1:26] is fact that is eternal that is reality
[1:28] that is unmovable
[1:30] what you are in the spirit land
[1:33] I am here
[1:39] if you're still vulgar minded and so
[1:41] forth in the spirit land you're vulgar
[1:42] minded here
[1:44] if you still got malice and envy and
[1:46] strife in the spirit land
[1:48] you're in the spirit land with that
[1:52] it reflects back here
[1:56] so you tell me which is reality
[1:58] if this is reflecting that which is the
[2:01] reality
[2:02] and what should I be more focused on and
[2:04] accept in my life
[2:06] and which should I believe more when the
[2:08] devil presents it to me
[2:10] I assure you he's not going to present
[2:12] this to you he'll present every laodice
[2:15] and condition to you but he's sure not
[2:16] going to come and come along and remind
[2:18] you
[2:20] what you are truly in the spirit Realm
[2:23] there's a lot of things that he's going
[2:25] to tell you but that's not going to be
[2:26] one of them
[2:29] he says what you're in the spirit land
[2:32] it reflects back here
[2:34] but if your whole innermost being has
[2:37] become cleansed how many want to be
[2:39] cleansed and purged how many want to be
[2:41] purged and it shows that you've got a
[2:44] body out yonder waiting
[2:47] so you tell me who's farther Advanced me
[2:50] or that body that's waiting
[2:53] if it's waiting that means it's ahead of
[2:55] me that means it's been there before me
[2:59] that's been cleansed and purged and it's
[3:03] reacting back in the flesh
[3:13] what's happening in spiritual land
[3:16] what's truly happening in true reality
[3:19] is reacting back in this flesh
[3:23] and in your flesh
