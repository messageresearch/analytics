blessing to be living in this day and to be assembled together as our pastor prayed every day he brings us this way it's a great pleasure and the privilege that uh we don't want to share to share that with uh the world we want to enjoy it thanks M musicians God bless you and uh you may be seated just for a little while as our pastor asked me to give a little detail of our trip so brother Burley uh Williams uh you know him he's a friend to us here acquainted well with us so he's a a pastor in uh South Carolina so he's going to be traveling with me this time so we're going to be leaving next Tuesday uh and be in the Congo to stay there to be there for uh uh 2 weeks but it seems like the the emails have been getting and the phone calls seems like the churches are going to be left out they they they just feel like uh we don't love them so there many churches there so we have within the two weeks brother Burley and I will only have a chance to um to rest on Mondays on Mondays and we have so another day when we traveling uh from the the capital of uh the Dior cono which is kinasa headed uh East Northeast uh that day we're going to be resting as we're going to be traveling but most days we're going to be in almost churches some of them has to assemble they have asked if we can add a third week we're still disputing that but uh we we just want to be there and I know that uh it is uh your prayers and your love that are sending us we just don't want to fall short of that we want to thank each and every one of you for uh your full support our pastor the congregation here we have brothers maybe Brother Rich cob who also supports Us in that we have two precious Brothers at the the true Tabernacle been supporting the the the charity side and also with the the mission they've been so faithful all of you whatever you do I know the families here that are just supporting in any way in prayers and little donation here and those even the girls that are giving their clothings so every everything there just want to thank you for all you do the little you do and I remember the the prophet of God said in um in paman church age he said that the first miracle that ever happened to the messenger Martin the first miracle that ever happened to him that even issued him to start his ministry was giving right giving so when he who took that cloak that coat he cut it into two gave a half to the Lord Jesus the prophet of God not me not a man the seventh messenger said that was the first miracle that sent him to the mission field as a messenger we're looking for uh Miracles we're living with Miracles inside of us so giving is the first miracle that uh the messenger Martin started with amen you might say I haven't laid I have laid hands on the people they haven't got uh healed I haven't done this I haven't done this Martin just shared what he had amen and was the greatest miracle that opened up the door for his entire Ministry God bless you uh uh we we just want on to leave you guys but you know what as we go you will see that um even a little portion of the word we're going to be reading here my mind is already set up into the mission field so a lot of scriptures a lot of quotations because the false doctrines are running every place and the only way to combat that it's not with our intelligence we take the scripture and we take the messenger amen cuz sometimes people don't have message books on the other side anybody can quote them anything and said Prophet the prophet of God said this how would they verify that but as we go we have books and we can verify with them we we give them the the quotation the number this is you can the reference is there the scriptures said this the reference said this what you have where are you getting it from so pray for us those areas uh sometimes you have Believers that are being taken from denominations that would come to the meetings special meetings in some Churches and those pastors are fighting they don't like their sheeps uh being taken out to come to listen to the message so they are many attacks and uh different scenarios but uh we have a confidence in the one who's sending us so it's not something we're doing it halfhazard we know exactly who is uh the sender amen and he will take care of that God bless you U May let's stand and read uh the scripture here and I'm aware of the time so I have uh many scriptures and many quotations but hey as you pull we're going to be just speaking about the products our pastor reminded me again as the brother Tony spoke on Sunday I might not be able to present uh the pro products the way it is all the details how beautiful how performant the product is but I can assure you the product is perfect I might stumble here and there but the pro product is perfect amen God bless you let's read let's go to the Book of John chapter 12 we're going to be reading just a couple of uh verses so you can sit then you will sit down and as we'll get the the context of it this is John 12 we can s that the verse 20 and it says and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Phillip which was of be Bethesda of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus you may be seated as uh let's have a again a prayer precious Lord we we thank you for the time you have given us this evening Lord to look into the perfect one The Immortal one the Eternal one and Lord we in our bodies we are limited father we are inadequate to speak of the Eternal to even present the Eternal because of our limitations but Lord we calling you on the sin this evening that you would come you the immortal one would come father and take your th out your word whom you are yourself and father and divide it and and and and feed father the counterpart of your eternal life that is inside of each of one each one of us and father you will give us life be with us father bless Lord the the the the reading of the word and the service and let the name of Jesus Christ be glorified Among Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you so we would I take um subject here or a title that uh we desire to see Jesus and I'm taking it we can desire to see Jesus in many angle because Jesus is big is is greater than any thought of man anything that you can think of you desire to see Jesus it's just a little portion of yes right you cannot even bring it into consideration of who he is and we put it here in the way of eternal life we want to see Jesus but in the way of eternal life starting with uh the the book of uh John here John is relating us you will see that from the 12 the beginning of the the chapter this is 6 days before the pass uh the Feast of the Passover so meaning six days the Passover day would be the seventh day and Jesus is is is going to Lazarus place where Lazarus his two sisters Mary and uh and and in Martha where they lived Jesus is visiting them 6 days before the Passover now as he was sitting there at their place they uh prepared a supper for him Martha was cooking now these three people that are that are treating Jesus that are hosting Jesus here here they have something that all the people there don't have cuz these three people Lazarus knew exactly where he has been for 4 days where his Spirit was he knew that this one who sitting at the table who with me brought my spirit from there and I'm back again to to life I've been very sick couple days ago very sick and I I collapsed I didn't even know where I was was now here I am where I was I know the four where my spirit was traveling for 4 days I'm back here he has no doubt that he was sitting across the table with the eternal life that's that's Lazarus Mary Martha Martha knew that you when we we know what happened before uh the resurrection when she was talking to Jesus so Martha had no doubt that this person is the eternal life himself am Martha has done this family was over blessed and Mary Mary knew without any Shadow of Doubt that's the reason she could just imagine one pound of ointment of Spike n very exp even Judas Judas had to tell us that it was expensive otherwise you would knew that you would have known it was expensive very expensive one pound in the the the the the the saver so the perfume was was filled the entire house and she took her hair so she she she could give anything they could give anything they knew that we are facing eternal life itself now many people came there too to visit them those that heard that hey he Lazarus was resurrected by this uh this man here this Rabbi this prophet of Galilee they came some of them were there when he brought Lazarus to to life now they were the Bible said that they bear record they were testifying they were talking to others now the news were spreading and Jesus was sitting at the table being entertained and now the Pharisees came they look the way the news were was just spreading and the people coming believing they wanted to stop that these are these are not just a couple of few people dozens of people dozens of people talking these are multitude of people talking about the goodness of God God the god of Moses is back on the scene again there there things have not happened for many many years we're seeing this happening so they were just great news going on as we can read let's read again 12 let's start at uh 17 now the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the the Dead bear record for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle the Pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive you how you Prevail nothing they were murmuring they said there's no way who can contain this guy there's no way to contain this news here it's dangerous behold the world is gone after him and that's where we started reading earlier and there were there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Phillip which was of Bethesda of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus Philip come and tell Andrew and again Andrew and Philip uh tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying now this is becoming so critical and crucial cuz Jesus always does answer the way we think he ought to you might be asking a question and he speaking something that probably there's no correlation right but just think that every move that Jesus made on Earth every word he ever spoke anything he ever done this is perfect and it's Eternal it's the Perfection of anything that could be done so Jesus anything he might have said his entire life when he was on Earth any move he had made there's no sin there's no it's halfhazard things it's perfect because we will go to the book of Isaiah let's go to Isaiah 42 sorry that we are in the missionary mode we have to flip the pages Isaiah 42 we're just reading three verses if we get there Isaiah 421 goes behold my servant this is a prophecy given by the prophet Isaiah behold my servant speaking of Christ Jesus whom I uphold my elect in whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles this is the only one who would be bringing judgment to the Gentiles now when we say judgment it's only not to judge he's bringing Justice to the Gentiles some will receive that some will reject it but he's the one who's bringing it to them he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street so any Jesus in himself could do nothing this is what is telling here anything he did he was ordained by God to do so if God didn't tell him to lift up his arm Jesus will not lift up his arm that's how submissive he was to the father if he speaks the father told him to speak any every move he made reflected God he was ordained of God so meaning he could do nothing in himself not even to lift up his voice on himself he couldn't do that it has to be God lifting up his voice through him AB bruised the Reed shall he not break he couldn't do that in himself if he does it the father ordained him to do that in the smoking flax shall he uh not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he was there and these Greeks are showing up and remember these were stranger it's marvelous that when Solomon is dedicating the temple back 100 of years back Solomon knew as a prophet that the Gentiles will be coming too they will hear great news Solomon prayed for the Gentiles when he was praying for the the the children of Israel back when they were he was dedicating the temple let's go to his prayer one first king 8 chapter 8 first king we just want to give the background hope uh this doesn't get you to sleep stay [Laughter] awake first king chapter 8 uh verse 41 to 43 let's listen to Solomon's Prayer praying for you and me that's when the temple was dedicated Solomon knew that you were coming I was coming Salon said these are my brothers let me pray for them and he's saying in 41 he said moreover concerning a stranger a gentile that is not of thy People Israel but cometh out of a for country for thy name's sake for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth May Know Thy Name to fear thee as thy People Israel and that they may know that this house which I have builded is called by thy name these Were Strangers they were the Gentiles the Greeks as they came there they went to find um Jesus disciples if they went to ask if they would see the mass or if they would see Jesus gently Philip took them to Andrew and both Phillip and Andrew went to Jesus I don't know why they might have told him Master they they have lived with him for three and a half years so far they knew his agenda and they they knew his nature and they went Master these Greek Greeks they would like to see you maybe you they anticipating them saying Oh not this time maybe you can wait maybe let them wait there or something now Jesus is speaking now speaking Eternal words in that moment as the Greeks were Desiring to see him as they made themselves known to the disciples the disciples brought them to Jesus Jesus knew that something was happening knew that and he said the hour is come knew that once they because he was God he was led by God that place he went ordained by God and knew exactly what would be happening and as they came he knew that the time is at hand for something amen the changing of the ministry amen the time has come is come right and look at his nature before we can even analyze what go through not analyze but but just cover what he's telling them look at Jesus nature we saw his nature that he could not even uh uh cause his voice to be heard because he was totally dependent on the will of the father Jesus do you think Jesus wants to be known just to brag that hey I'm Jesus no the Bible tells it differently if we go to the Book of Mark 7 you might not have to turn Mark 7 chter 7 verse 30 to3 7 I can start reading it and again deporting from the coast of Ty and sidon he came unto the Sea of Galilee through the midst of the coast of uh decapolis 31 32 now and they bring unto him one of the one that was de deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseeched him to put his hand upon him and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and spit and touched his tongue and looking up up to heaven he sighed and said unto him um Eep eata EPA that is be opened and straight straight away his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain 36 and he charged them this is Jesus look look his nature he's not somebody who wants the fame who wants to be known all the time because he wants us to be not in the body form he wants us in the spiritual way 36 he charged them that they should tell no man this is something great that has happened A great miracle there now he's char in them he said you have seen that tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it if you go to the Book of Matthew Matthew also 16:15 he does the same thing when Simon Peter he go 16 and he said Matthew 16 let's let's read together sorry for uh going fast Matthew 16 and verse 15 let's read it together we we just trying to see the nature of Jesus is not somebody who said hey I want to do this people can know that Jesus is here that was not his nature that's right that's not him so what the Greeks are asking for it's something contrary to Jesus nature in Matthew 6 he said 15 uh verse 15 he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shal lose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven then charge he his disciples not that hey go tell the people that I'm Jesus who told you the Christ no he's charging his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus Christ that's the second second witness let's get the third witness Luke 5 Luke Chapter 5 I read verse 12 to 15 this is about the man which uh was full of leprosy 12 and it came to pass when he was in a certain city Behold a man full of leprosy who seeing Jesus fell on his face and besought him saying Lord if thou will thou can make me clean and he put forth his hand and touched him and saying I will be thou clean and immediately the Le leprosy departed from him and he charged him same thing to tell no man but go and show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded for a testimony unto them so Jesus was not here on the scene to to make a show that I would like people to know me they can come and see me oh the Greek has have showed up my goodness this is an opportunity to show myself that was not his nature that was not what Jesus was here for and not only that the the Greek had to pass another another barrier another test too not only Jesus didn't want people people to know he ched them not to tell that I'm Jesus now the Greek were not of the household of Israel it's complicated not only he doesn't do the show he doesn't make a show out of him himself he always charged the people to tell no man that he is the Christ he's Jesus and now these are Greeks Matthew 10 go there to see Matthew 10 10: 5 these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles don't even visit the Greeks don't visit Africa don't visit America America don't visit Europe or New Zealand Australia saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of Samar of the Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as they go as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Matthew 15 just flip a couple of pages this is when the serop phenician lady came pleading for her daughter 15:21 then Jesus went then and departed into the coast of Tyron sidon and behold a woman of of Canaan came out of the the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my hor is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cth after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of isra Israel so these Greeks have had a tough day awaiting them because they are going in front of a man who is not making a show out of himself or out of his ministry and beside that he only came to the household of Israel so Jesus never wants us people to know him by following a certain movement or car pulling experience Jesus wants to meet people people individually by Revelation and he does that most time he would even sneak out living his disciples so it it would only be a secret meeting between the one who is Desiring to see him and himself so he can reveal himself not in the flesh because you could see the body of Jesus you will never get any benefit from it they can bring his he can bring his body just this evening here here walking there shaking hands you will get no virtue from that body no benefit but if you know him by Revelation then you have the full benefits of not only the full benefits that is above the Corporal body that you are seeing this is the entire Heaven that is available that is at your disposal amen for a benefit am so they came coming back to our scripture philli cometh and tell Andrew and again Andrew and philli tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come when the the Greeks were telling him about the Greeks outside Jesus knew that this is a sign that time is no more for the Jews I've got to turn to the Gentiles but can they cannot see me they cannot meet me in this way the Gentiles we meet on the on the cross is is uh Isaac had to cross his hand the prophet of God said that Isaac had to cross his hand Jo Joseph came with his two children he had in Egypt he came with them in front of Jacob his father sorry Jacob and before Jacob could uh bless them God is crossing his hand so we Gentiles so the bride could be brought into eternal life it's on the cross that we have to meet him and Jesus is laying this in all the what what he's going to be telling them there is is is him is the fullness of God bodily full of wisdom is laying something that is of so so profound from Genesis to Revelation that is contained in what he's going to be telling the Greeks at this moment let's go back to John 12 very profound that those that were there it would go above because some most of them were not even of their time for his disciples it had to be much higher for the Greek they could not because he was talking here from Genesis from before Adam and after the Revelation you could tie every book of the the Bible to every statement that Jesus is going to be giving in John 12 John 12 23 and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified he had to be glorified because the only the Holy Spirit could only come could only be made available after Jesus was glorified without his glory without being him not being glorified the the Holy Spirit was not available 24 he said verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat for fall into the ground and die it abide alone but if it die it bring forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hate his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life unto life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if If any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorify it glorified it and I will glorify it again so these Greeks triggered something in the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ by them coming up in just just a little desire hey Phillip we desire to see Jesus not knowing that it was something that was pre-ordained of God that once this drop hits this Jesus is going to be speaking such profound words in such a way that the father had to intervene in that communication he forgot about the Greeks he forgot about his disciples now he's talking Eternal things knowing that no no one of them is even understanding what I'm talking about only the father could understand what he was saying and the father showed up he thundered and the people that were said he it it they heard a thunder speaking to the father so great that the time might not be allowing that to do that but the prophet of God said this in U in the message uh zakus because we know that within these words that Jesus is laying in chapter 12 he's showing us where when we can see him where to see him how to see him and how to know that you have seen him there inside here the prophet of God is saying this and said in preaching 1958 if you want to see him you know God will make a way for you to see him yes prise God Amen if you desire to see him this is not just hey I want to to see him no if there's a yearning amen if there's a craving inside of you if there something that probably your wife cannot even help you with your husband might not be able to help you with it's it's it's it's inside of you it's driving you beyond your explanation to anybody beside you right if you desire you have that yearning inside of you God Will Make A Way amen yes sir and the prophet of God said it may be ridiculous I love that it may be ridiculous but God will make a way for you to see him and you know you might have to even come to a Full Gospel business meeting some morning very ridiculous to you your prestige meaning he got to knock off some feathers out of you but if you want to see him God will make a way for you to see him what what a beautiful promise sir just come to a spot that you are really Desiring to see him brother and sister there's a sure promise that he will make a way for you to see him and you cannot fake that you cannot produce that yourself because the book of Romans 9:15 915 says for he saith to Moses I will have this is God telling Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy even if you are Desiring to see Jesus you will never produce for him to show up there God Will Make A Way but you have to wait cuz it's not because you can run or you can be willing to do that he's the one who shows Mercy now even if you run let's for instance if you run you are so willing badly to see him as I mentioned earlier his Corporal body will never never do you any good because Isaiah 53 you're familiar with this 23 said for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and a root out of a dry ground he hath no form no nor comeliness there's no Beauty and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him if you Desiring him it for something unrelated to his Corporal appearance it has to be something bigger than what he would appear in if he would appear here three he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not this is the kind of if you want to see his Corporal body he there's no attraction for for for his body towards you that you can see somebody that you said this is that and that because we know that Judas Judas lived with him for 3 and a half years he betrayed him he saw him that's right so if Desiring to see Jesus does something good he didn't he didn't do good for Judah Judas the Young Rich Man the same way he saw Jesus Jus that's right he didn't help him he saw him face to face even a pilate right pilate saw him face to face Herod Herod saw him face to face Herod had that the same desire that the the Greek the Greeks had you don't have to turn it to Luke 979 it says that now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that John was risen from the dead and some that Elias had appeared and of and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again and Herod said John have I beheaded but who is this of whom I hear such things and he desired to see him he had a great desire too and because the prophet of God says if you want to see him he will make a way he made a way for Herod he gave Herod an opportunity Luke 23 31 I can read it to give you time he was given an opportunity but let's see what he did with the opportunity Luke 23 verse three and pilate asked him saying asking Jesus pilate has been given the greatest opportunity the Greeks were fighting their way this is it was the day Jesus was at Lazarus Place 6 days before the Passover it was the next day 5 days before the Passover that these Greeks were making their ways because of the great news they wanted to see him so bad but here pilate had him in in front of him face to face with the very one that the Greeks desired so earnestly to see and he answered him and said he he said art thou the king of the Jews and he answered him and said thou say sayth it then said pilate to the chief priest and to the people I find no fault in this man that's why he could benefit from being in front of Jesus from seeing him face to face the only benefit is I find no fault with him and they were the more Fierce the saying he stir up the people teaching throughout all Jew jewelry beginning From Galilee to this place when pilot heard of Galilee he asked whether the men were a Galilean and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herod's jur jurisdiction jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time God making a way for Herod because he desired to see Jesus and when Herod saw Jesus he was exceeding glad what was he exceeding glad for for he was desirous to see him of a long season so he has been planning for long Desiring maybe in his prayers if he was praying in his own ways I want to see this man so I heard great news of him is being brought to him and he does it to each and every one of us because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing as we said earlier he could only open his mouth if the father opens his mouth he could do nothing he opened not his his mouth and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him and Herod with his Men of War set him at not and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate without knowing where to meet him where to see him when to see him how to see him how to know that you have seen him you can it's easy to set him at not without realizing without realizing so setting him at not meaning he was treat he was treated as unimportant we can do the same thing if we do not know exactly how to see him treated as an unimportant worthless despised disregarded the prophet of God says this in uh s we would see Jesus that's where uh you will see most of the the quotations are in this message the prophet of God preached 12 message messages on S we would see Jesus and I just picked up one the one in 1961 he preached it uh in Jeffersonville and that's uh where I base this uh uh this subject the prophet of God said and it's going to be kind of lengthy but I'm going to S it so here's the prophet of God he was praying in 1961 [Music] to take a mission a reach trip he wanted to go to I think to go to Germany to go to um uh Norway and Africa in many other countries so he's praying in the morning between 9 and 10 he's breaking into a vision and in that Vision he's seeing himself entering into a store and in that store there were two counters he saw two ladies one at one store one one one counter one at the other counter now he saw a man a man walking to one of the counter counters and purchasing uh a perfume for his wife and the prophet of God stepped closer came also to ask the same lady how much is the perfume there she said oh this one is uh 40 cents you can read it in that message so I'm just going by memory here this one is 40 cents and the prophet of God said but I I I would like lilac I would like lilac because he likes the Lilac uh perfume and he said how about lilac that lady said lilac is about .98 and then the prophet of God took out of his pocket a purse or he called himself um a purse instead of a wallet he said a purse so so he took two dollar bills supposedly giving $2 dollar bills to that lady thinking that hey she's going to give giving me two two pennies back and when that lady took the money the two dollar bills she realized that one was a American Dollar and the other one was a Canadian $5 bills now she said oh you have given me um a foreign money the prophet of God went and said oh I'm sorry because I'm a missionary so he was even answering God was answering his prayer within the same vision that I'm confirming that you're going to be going to the mission I'm a missionary so I go to different countries and I get different monies so give me the uh Canadian $5 bill and then the prophet gave him gave her another dollar uh $1 bill and she gave uh the changes to the prophet as she was the prophet was still talking to her that lady speaking to the other lady that was at the other counter let me start from there it's uh let me read it and he said and while I was talking all looking at her she looked over the next woman now the prophet is going to be interpreting this dream this vision for us she looked over the next woman and she kind of nodded her head and she said dear do you believe that brother brandham is right that we women today will have to live like he told us with the cutting of our hair and the wearing of our perils and like and things like that said don't you think that he is wrong in that this is one lady the one that sold the Lilac perfume to the prophet telling the other lady and she said the other lady said yes and she said go ahead honey you Ruth whatever her name was said you have the inspiration say it now the prophet is of God is going to tell us that these are two churches he's telling us one church is attacking him that he want us to live like in the old days and things like that and and but for her to do that she had the inspiration the very people that can criticize this message they are only those that are inspired to do so cuz anybody who doesn't know anything about the message will just stay away from it but for you to attack this message you must have a certain inspiration to do that that's right and World quickly I knew this is the prophet saying quickly I knew I was in the vision we're still in we want to see Jesus right so just going through this quickly I knew I was in the vision so I knew that I that that was them two women always see the both Oneness and Trinity Church the eye of an eagle is going seeing exactly those kind of those anointings the Oneness in the Trinity Church there they were standing there and said yes said I don't think we should because that's that's the the lady that was inspired to say so still continuing speaking I don't think we should because we have never seen his eyes we have never seen the eyes of Jesus we have never seen his makeup we wouldn't know what he would look like so why would we do it why would we listen to what brother brandham is saying to be modest to be letting our hair grow and everything why do we have to do that we have never even seen Jesus we don't even know how he looks like or his makeup and I had on an old Patrol suit and I said to to the woman I said just a moment my sister see you do have to live just according to the Bible no matter no matter how it was she said but we never lived back there and we never seen him that was a tough one in the prophet of God and I said I have seen him I thought Lord now I'm before two great smart churches now you got to give me wisdom this is the prophet of God the seventh angel messenger in a vision he's asking God to give him the wisdom to be able to answer these questions by inspired churches with an inspiration and so then I heard heard myself go to talking and the prophet of God said I want you to examine it I love that said I want you to examine it now listen to what the prophet is going to say excuse me never thought of it in my life I said a man today has to be like he was then because he's the same man he's made up of five senses and if he stood and looked at him right in the face he would still have to have that sick sense of Faith to believe him no matter what he looked like that's the inspiration that's the wisdom that God gave him that regardless of man today is still like the man in the old time he would still have to have that sick sense of Faith to believe him no matter what he looked like he he would have to believe him anyhow that's right and they did hid their their faces with shame that's right and said we never saw it sir like that this is just to coming back to our subject to say that seeing Jesus as a single unit and as a man as a a Corporal body as an individual standing in appearance will never do you any good no benefit if he was for benefit pilot would have had benefits herods Herod would have had benefit Judas would have had benefit but it's not that way even if he would come to to to tonight you would have no benefit no benefit at all sometimes we have that Pentecostal or Baptist mindset that if I see him appearing something will happen in my life he could be appearing all the time and you are setting him at not that's right sir because you can only see him by faith in the message we Serv we see Jesus 1957 the prophet of God said all of us want want want to see him I want to see him you want to see him and th the desire of the Christian world is to see him that was the desire of the Orthodox Jew uh world of the Jew Jewish church when Jesus came they wanted to see the Messiah but they didn't believe him when he was made manifested the main thing is when he's manifested we will see the when the the where the What the how are very important in seeing Jesus he said they didn't believe him when he was manifested and I wonder sometimes if that's just about isn't what we are to we long to see Jesus but when he appears we think it's something else we turn him down the disciples did that they want one time in the boat dark the water tossing the the boat on each side and they saw Jesus coming on the water but they were afraid they thought he was a ghost so they saw him coming but they were still afraid right so the how to see him the where to see him when to see him very critical that's right the prophet of God said in the same message knowing that there was some God somewhere and they had talking about the the the Greeks they had thousands of them that they worshiped and they had they heard they uh they would heard they have heard of a historical God that done great Miracles among the Hebrews and then they had also heard that this God that used to be the miracle working Hebrew God was over there in the land with them again that's the news that these Greeks heard the same God they used to be with them he's back in their land let's go meet him so it attracted their attention so they came to see Jesus and notied usually the way the that people want to to find Jesus is to find somebody who knows how to take them to him am a leader or one of his servants is the way they find him so Jesus if he ever chooses a servant he always chooses somebody that will bring the people to him because it's his purpose to to serve the people now when they came to Jesus Jesus didn't point to himself he this is me have you heard about me where I was born never even mentioned anything he pointed them to the word to meet him that's right let's see the word to meet him same message the prophet said now here's the great thing in the text that's unusual just just as soon as these Greeks was pointed to Jesus Jesus did not point to himself or he did not make himself known to them because you cannot know Jesus in that way the prophet of God is just tearing every conception of the seven church chages have you want to see him with nail scor SC scored hands he's tearing that everything that had been written I want to see him he will look this way in that way he said you cannot see him in that way Jesus is not known in that way we see here in the scripture that when these Greeks were brought up to Jesus and were in his presence it looks like Jesus would have said well I am the Messiah of the Jews race that's been predicted by the prophets by inspiration down through the the centuries and I'm here now and I'm the the born of Nazareth I'm of a Jewish mother my father is God and I'm here not to I'm here now to make myself known to the Greeks he didn't do that he's pointing them to something he's pointing him to himself now let's listen where how to find him how to see him in the same message he said now that would be more like the 1961 version of it if he would point to himself that's right the 2024 version of it but look as soon as they were brought in his presence that's the main thing get the people in his presence days in and days out we see the Holy Spirit using precious Brothers our pastor coming to this he's pointing you to him to his presence and as soon as in his presence Jesus said except corn of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone what an unusual thing instead of accepting their introduction the thing he done was pointed them to a place that they could find him this is the revelation of our day how to see Jesus he has to point you to a place where you can find and see him let's see that place praise God what did he do here he pointed them to that great Truth how to see him they could not see him in the way of eternal life just by standing there the way he was he was a man but Christ himself pointed the people to his death and said except a corn of we falls in the ground it abides alone oh how different it is yes sir how different but your life and his life find each other your life in Jesus life you finding each other in his death where to find him to see him it's when you're dying to yourself when every me in you is gone Mary and and Martha got that chance and Lazarus they knew him that's why they could do him a service because they have seen him they have been dead to everything within them they were convinced Lazarus has nothing else to lose by by by by by testifying of Jesus right in such a way that he made the Pharisees mad they wanted to kill him back you imagine I'm I'm testifying of my resurrection so I make you so mad you want to kill me again he was completely dead to him himself amen Mary dead in such a way that her hair the beauty for her didn't mean anything right she gave it all you your life and his life find each other not at the church not in a building not in a Creed not in good works but in the cross where you are crucified with him am we want to see Jesus yes sir there's one place we can see him amen we can find him when we dying to every thought of I am this I can this when the word of God said that this is it the message of the says this you said but setting him at not that's right yes sir that's where to find Christ you don't find him by doing better turning a new page starting a new life you don't find Christ you find Christ only in death sir that's the word to to see him amen anybody who had had the privilege to see him in the revelation of the time he has to find him in death even Peter could you imagine Peter's wife your master said that unless you eat his his flesh and drink his blood honey what do you think of that Peter had no answer to his wife that's right him alone has the words of eternal life to whom would I go he became ridiculous before his wife maybe his children why because he seen him he he's he he's been dead himself you don't find him in a Manger not in a confession to believe in a certain Creed and fables you don't find Christ there it Cho a true servants takes you to him and he is the word meaning the way to see the word because Christ is the word Jesus is the word the way to see the word to find him is in death every time we come here if God can just realign our motives and objectives that every time I come God let me die more let me die more we finding him more let me die more we seeing him more that's what we we are here to be and to do and he said you want to be alive in the world and still you want to be religious so you accept an intellectual conception of it and then when you do that you will still dead in sin and trespasses he doesn't say if you go to church or if you listen to messages you go to camp meetings he said if you are still you accept an intellectual conception right you are still dead in sin and trespasses there a line there how to see him we see where we can find him we can only find him in death and once we find him in death our eyes of understanding open up then we can Behold Him we will start beholding him from Death in the same this is in one uh just one more more time lord preached in 1963 the prophet of God is showing us is telling us are you ready to die because he knows that that's the first step into meeting seeing Jesus death to myself that's death to yourself amen meeting him at the cross Amen in his death to start seeing him said are you ready to die are you Assemblies of God General Assembly are you ready to die Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or you ready to die out to your enemy are you willing to pay the price of sacrifice really sincerely this is the how the how is you've got to know that this requires a heavy price your surrounding will never give you the same consideration you used to have I know you have family members here all of us together we have some people in our family that think we're crazy can never even even when they know something about you who's that there is a heavy price to pay for this message once we come to it once we is everything else is just flying good there's a little question mark there God am I am I seeing you cuz before you can see him there's a heavy price to be paid and the prophet of God is asking us are you willing am I willing are you willing to pay the price of sacrifice really sincerely you don't know the sacrifice God might require you but are you ready said God whatever you bring my way way I'm ready we have to be ready for any sacrifice we want to see him this is how to see him we want to see him where we meet him it's in death not just come and say we'll give it a try and see how I come out no this is not a try you're not ready yet the prophet of God says if you want to give it a try you are not ready yet to see Jesus that's right right you must be ready to pay the price and die this is destruction altogether price and death sacrifice and death it's not you give sacrifice and then something good happen you give you are you ready to sacrifice and then to die to yourself your fathers your mothers are you fathers you mothers are you ready to establish an altar altar in your house and take that television out are you ready I know that most of us we don't have those we don't even know never had a television in our homes are you ready to take that deck of cards off the table them comic books that your children is reading preparing their little mind to a blast that the devil is going to them or you ready to establish the old family altar again I like he said again because we might have had it years back and we slipped we slipped out that's how to see Jesus or do you want to continue on the way you are the two choices there ready to pay the sacrifice or you are you wanting to continue the way you are you want to continue on you're not in condition of coming yet you're not in condition of meeting Jesus seeing him if you want to continue the way you're continuing but I pray that you will be like Samson you see the price and you are ready Lord let me die with them Samson had that Revelation at the end of his life when he had nothing else to lose said Lord once more realized that he had faith he had so many feathers on him that the time that came he was ready not only to sacrifice but unto death to see him in the message the Paradox was give me a few more minutes in the message the Paradox the prophet of God said that seed must die when the Greeks come to Jesus and said we would see Jesus Jesus what did he say the first thing he said except a corn of wheat falls into the ground dies it abides alone he showed them how to see him he showing them how to see him Greeks they want to see me unless they meet me in death at the cross they can see my shape there's an arm message the prophet said prophet of God say they saw his form but Jehovah was veiled to them that's right God was veiled in that body they could not see him that's right but in death they would see what was behind the person of Jesus said die to yourself die to your ethics we have some ethics of our own we want to see Jesus let get those things to die die to your Creeds and all this just be born in the word into Christ that's a paradox in the Mighty God unveiled he said the Greeks wanted to see him but they were unable to see him because he was in the temple of his Humanity God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself now we find that in this these Greeks could not see him and notice the very word that Jesus expressed to them after he said except BN of weed falls into the ground dies and abides alone in other words they would never be able to see him in the change in the mask that he was in WoW because he was veiled in human flesh but when this corn of wheat fell into the ground then it would bring forth all Races amen that's right Jesus to see Jesus it's more than one individual that's right you want to see all the races he was he was sent to the Jews of course at that time but this corn of wheat must for veiled God in human flesh hidden from unbelievers but revealed to Believers I know the time is flying I'm not even halfway yet but going there these Greeks came a little bit early that's right they came a bit early am cuz Jesus came in the morning he revealed himself to the Jews at noon he's revealing himself to the Samaritan because they were to see him right they these Jews were these Greeks were in the afternoon they should have waited in the evening time in the evening time would take 2,000 years they came early that's why Jesus said it's not time yet it was six days before the Passover thir Church ages they had to wait at the end of the seventh day this is the time that the Jew the Greeks could come and say we want to see Jesus and let me read something as we the musicians you can come the prophet of God says this in the message to see Jesus preached 1954 he said why don't he go down to the graveyard talking about the the Pharisees and those people that were criticizing him why don't he go down to the graveyard if he's the son of God and say all the people in the grave come out he could have done it the prophet of God said he could have done it if the father would have told him to because he could do nothing unless he seen it from the father but the father only showed him and he was submissive to the father and the same signs that followed Jesus Vision telling him what to do and how to do it Jesus did that in the world houss anything they wanted to he went on about the father's business that same Jesus is here tonight am now when the prophet of preaching in 1954 he's here 70 years later in 2024 that Jesus is here tonight amen do you believe it I believe it amen he will manifest himself in that way will you take all doubt out of your mind and go away from here tonight and do everything you can to get Sinners to come and be saved and sick people to be healed and confessing your sin and die to yourself if he will come he he who's listen he who is listening now if he will come and manifest himself he asked for the hands up I don't ask you for uh raising your hands up but he said now now people can see Jesus only in you let's stand the way you do now the people can see Jesus only in you how do they see him the way you do the way you act amen the way you live is how the people know Jesus today so the Greeks asked him the burden is upon us amen he said no I I cannot tell you who I am now I cannot show myself to you sister Karen will be my face in 2024 brother John will be my face in 2024 it's you and me that have that heavy heavy responsibility that the world could see Jesus again amen this is the only if his body comes here there's no help but within your body and my body there is still the help to the needy to the world right let's bow our heads together in prayer precious Heavenly Father your word is it's no longer a word of a prophet to us you have come and visited us yourself this is you I'm no longer seeing you as a word I'm seeing my Lord everything every time I read it and I listen to it it's you and father we know Through the Ages man has tried to see you and Lord we want not even looking for you we didn't even not know but yet we were in you and we came this way smitten with amnesia we started just acting like chickens but father thank you for that scream of the mother Eagle that scream has brought life to us Lord that scream let it father not only take Lord off all the feathers off of us but transform us father into the very image of the great Jehovah that father our neighbors our acquaintance those around us Lord they are Desiring to see you Lord would you use our bodies the very life that inside of this body is to be the reflection of yourself to others and father we thank you for the blood that has done this work in our lives We Believe Lord that your blood has washed us and cleanse us from every filth Lord that we've been exposed to and you are now father molding us shaping us into in so much that when the people that came to Paul they wanted to touch His Garment and who they saw they saw you Peter and and James the the gate beautiful they reflected you they people were even aware that these are ignorant they don't know nothing but one thing they knew was they have been with you in so much with you that father they reflected you the people could see yourself reflected in them Lord help us on our walk we we weak with children forgive us father of any chall things we we might have lingered on father doing or acting and not reflecting you but Lord your word has set us free and we know for sure that we that father you will do it let your life of this word come inside of us to live out father the full expression of your being we thank you tonight bless your children and sorry for taking l a little longer and father go with us and bless us and we'll glorify your name in Jesus Christ and we pray amen any little song There Brother All I want to see is Jesus oh all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus shineing Through Me Oh all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus shining through me amen how many of us want to see see Jesus amen question is are we willing to die and then find him where he is it was so amazing while he was ministering just so many things were coming to me things that we've known we've known for so long but we know what form he dwells in now he's in the form of his bride cuz when if a seed abides alone it's alone but if it fall into the ground and die he says it bringeth forth much fruit he said that's how you'll see me Gentiles you'll see me after I go into the ground and die and come up a many membered body amen that's how you'll see him but if we want the World to See Jesus then we must be a display of Jesus Christ and what was Jesus Jesus had died to himself and he only did that which the father showed him so if I'm going to be the display of Jesus I have to die to myself and only do that which the word tells me to do to be a display of the word to be a display of Christ I have to be lined up to the word just like Jesus was lined up to the word amen that's what I want to do is I want to be someone that that Jesus can shine himself through so that they can see Jesus amen it's going to take a surrender and a sacrifice like the brother was saying of our thinking of our ways of our desires and surrendering to his and then the other side of that every time we run into Calamity and trouble and Despair and we have issues we always want Jesus to come on the scene how many call for him oh God would you show yourself to me God would you display yourself to me God would you come and rescue me and even we as believers who know this truth we're always looking for God to come writing in and rescue us and God to show himself and we miss the way God will do it because he'll do it through his body it's all around us amen he can speak to you through the brother in the pull pit he can speak to you through the one standing next to you right now he can speak through Fellowship through a text message amen don't miss him when he shows up to answer your question don't miss him when he shows up to bring Deliverance amen let's not miss where he is amen it's powerful when we can see him it'll change us we'll start to recognize that's not my brother that's God Amen answering my question that's not my sister that's God he heard my prayer but he brought it through this sister amen because if we could see him we can benefit from seeing him amen praise God God is so good man I appreciated the word appreciated the Revelation and I'd like for us to pray for brother Emanuel before he goes I won't be here I was able to rearrange some things for our trip we won't be leaving tonight like I said but we'll be leaving after the funeral and so some things worked out that's why he's preaching tonight and we we got the brothers who will be preaching while I'm gone so I'd like to go and pray for him cuz I won't be here for Sunday brother if you'll come down if the ministering Brothers will come if if you all come we want to lay hands on our brother we want to unite together as a congregation and send him forward with the blessings of the Lord and we want to

you would guard his mouth that you would protect his body that you would bless him in every way bless him through the travels Lord and bless him in every Junction and every turn may your spirit lead him God in every service and in every conversation Lord would you bring truth out of his mouth would you use him to spread the gospel he and our brother Burley Lord would you bless them Lord Lord in

their visitation well we love you we ask that you would accomplish these things for your purpose in our brother and our brother Burley as well in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen God bless you

challenged us to see you as you're presenting yourself in this day God what a challenging statement to know that if you were back in your Corporal body it would just be like it was the first time only those that had eyes to see could see who you were others saw you but they missed Lord the day of their visitation they didn't recognize you when you were standing present and oh God the same thing's true today you're here Lord you're here you're embodied in the body of your bride and Lord there's multitudes missing the day of visitation help us not to miss it Lord but help us to recognize where you are and help us to get full benefit from it and Lord give us the courage to come the way of death death to self death to every idea we've ever held every ambition and every un desire of our own may we yield that to you that we might walk in this earth the way you walked when you were here surrendered and submissive to your leadership God may we recognize you as you present yourself through our brothers and sisters but may we also give a true representation to the world of who you really are by surrendering to your word and allowing your spirit to flow through us and to live that word in our flesh so that we can represent you to this world it's a tall order Lord we can't do it of our own but we can do it because you predestinated us to and we believe that now we surrender to you a fresh and we want to pray a prayer of consecration Lord that we can be consecrated to you and dedicated to you that our ears will be used to hear your word that our mouth will be used to speak your word God that this body will be used to live your word Lord so that you will once again be on display in the world and that they might see you Lord God I pray that you would give us the strength by your spirit to live this manifestation we love you Lord we ask that you'd bless us as we go bless the aant family as they come to the day of viewing tomorrow and funeral on Friday May you watch over them and bless them Comfort them Lord and guide them strengthen them and underg them with your own hand Lord through this time we love you and ask your blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
