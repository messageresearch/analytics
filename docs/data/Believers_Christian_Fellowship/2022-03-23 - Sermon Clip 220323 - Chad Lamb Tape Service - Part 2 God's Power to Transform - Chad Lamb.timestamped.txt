[0:00] religion see that is satan's business
[0:02] not to kill the whole thing
[0:04] but just contaminate it
[0:07] that's all he ain't going to kill the
[0:08] whole thing oh not communist no no the
[0:11] antichrist is not communism the bible
[0:13] said it would deceive the elect if it
[0:15] was possible don't notice the iron
[0:17] curtain but the purple one
[0:20] the catholic one the false religion the
[0:22] church and he says religion is satan's
[0:24] business he not to kill the whole thing
[0:28] now listen that we understand that and
[0:30] the great the great uh concept that's
[0:32] been brought to us of the fallacy of
[0:34] denominations and false religion under
[0:36] the purple curtain and the mother having
[0:38] daughters and all of that but listen the
[0:41] the the devil he'll get into and if he
[0:43] can make the message religious
[0:48] and not personal
[0:51] then hasn't he done the same thing
[0:54] if he can if he can make the message
[0:56] just a form of religion and we can have
[0:58] a religion for religious form of worship
[1:01] in the message but take away the
[1:03] individual connection between you and
[1:05] christ amen you individually connected
[1:08] to a living god having met jesus christ
[1:11] personally and haven't even personally
[1:12] revealed to you but can move into the
[1:14] realm whereby a religious order of
[1:17] believing the message and being in a
[1:18] message church now i'm okay hasn't he
[1:21] accomplished the same thing
[1:24] so we can always say we see it here and
[1:25] we see it there but the devil hasn't
[1:27] quit working just because we come into a
[1:29] message church and say i believe the
[1:31] prophet he's still trying the same old
[1:33] tactics he's always trying
[1:35] so we've got to be careful that the
[1:36] message never becomes religion for us or
[1:38] we never let it become religion for our
[1:40] children amen but it has the message is
[1:43] personal amen it's not group it's never
[1:46] group it never it never will be group
[1:48] the message is to the individual
[1:51] this revelation is to one person
[1:55] and you decide who that person is but
[1:57] i've already decided who it is for me
