========================================

what changed you is you realize that this revelation coming to you was calling your name that you believed it and he was saying you're part of this you're the name that was there all of these things i'm showing you what i've done how i've redeemed my whole plan because now i've come to the end of that plan and i'm showing you what the plan was so that i can open the book and show you your name is on this book that's what thrilled our hearts at the opening of the seals don't let anything change how can you change that you can't change what's in that book so just stick with the word just believe what he said say what the tapes say say it i mean if they hook you to a lie detector and the lie detector goes off red red red red red he's lying i'd say it anyways because i believe that word before i believe my own thoughts and my own flesh body and my own ability to perspirate and get nervous when i begin to say things the word is still true regardless of my reaction regardless of my thoughts regardless of my mind the word is true always true always will be true i want to say what the tapes say i want to say what the scriptures say and not say what i'm feeling right now because if you wait 15 minutes your feelings will change amen but this word will never change god's feeling for you won't change his love for you won't change your position in him won't change but your feelings will change your thoughts will change your understanding will change so stick with the word praise god we're still reading in sirs we would see jesus from 1964. i said this is review there's a lot of review but this is so important friends this is a revelation this is something we've heard and heard and heard but the implication has got to change our lives the implication has got to be manifest in the way we speak and the way we act and the way we view things around us this this is statements with implications the implications have to become tangible it's gotta it's gotta stop being conceptual it's gonna stop being an idea that's exciting it's gonna stop being something brother branham said that i can say amen to or the preacher gets everybody riled up by saying these things it's got to move from conceptual a thrilling concept it's got to be tangible in our lives where i say that's me that's the truth that's the reality and everything else is a lie so we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it till something inside clicks and say that's not a neat idea that's who i am
