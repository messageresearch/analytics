[7:58] amen god bless you all while we're
[8:00] standing let's take our bibles and turn
[8:02] to second corinthians chapter 11.
[8:05] and i just want to give you an update we
[8:07] were able to go over to
[8:09] brother levi yoder and his family's
[8:11] place over
[8:13] in stark county just north of holmes
[8:15] county on sunday evening and had a
[8:16] service there we had a really really
[8:18] wonderful time it was really a nice home
[8:21] meeting and we thank god for his
[8:22] presence and for the word and
[8:25] levi's brother ben and his whole family
[8:26] was there so it was good to have them
[8:28] there and join us and god's doing a work
[8:30] amongst them all so we thank you for
[8:32] your prayers thank you to those who are
[8:34] able to travel out and support the
[8:36] services there and we just had a
[8:37] wonderful time and so i just want to
[8:39] give you an update on that
[8:41] also uh i heard a report i got a report
[8:44] that brother jason demars is starting to
[8:46] improve amen so thank you for your
[8:48] prayers he's beginning to show signs of
[8:50] improvement they're just beginning to
[8:52] wean him off of the auction and so far
[8:54] he's responding well to that so they're
[8:56] hoping if things go well in another day
[8:58] or two they may be able to get him out
[9:00] of icu into a regular room so just
[9:02] continue to hold the brother up in
[9:04] prayer that god will give him a full
[9:06] restoration amen
[9:08] praise god
[9:10] amen let's take and look at second
[9:12] corinthians chapter 11
[9:14] verse 2.
[9:20] for i am jealous over you with godly
[9:22] jealousy for i have espoused you to one
[9:24] husband that i may present you as chaste
[9:27] virgin to christ
[9:28] but i fear lest by any means as the
[9:30] serpent begot eve through the through
[9:32] his subtlety so your mind should be
[9:35] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[9:37] christ amen you can have your seats we
[9:40] ask the lord that his blessing to the
[9:42] reading of his word this evening
[9:45] amen i appreciate your song sister
[9:48] jackie it was really special it's quite
[9:50] a sacrifice for sister jackie to drive
[9:52] all the way over here amen to sing
[9:54] something the lord has given her but it
[9:56] was quite a blessing and there was one
[9:58] section in there that really touched me
[10:00] and really blessed me because it's the
[10:02] subject that i'm preaching on tonight
[10:04] and so i love when god does something
[10:05] like that it's such an encouragement
[10:08] i'd like to continue on with that series
[10:10] i was on the unexpected fulfillment this
[10:13] is the unexpected fulfillment part five
[10:15] and i want to talk about the marriage of
[10:17] the lamb
[10:19] amen so remember the series is the
[10:21] unexpected fulfillment amen and it's so
[10:24] good this past sunday we were talking
[10:26] about um
[10:28] talking about god's word brings order
[10:29] and and i was just sharing with you what
[10:31] i had shared with the brothers and the
[10:33] ministers meeting on zoom and it so
[10:35] blessed me and i was so thankful for
[10:37] that and and not to get into church
[10:39] order but just to show that god has
[10:41] order amen and the purpose of that order
[10:44] so blessed me and and i had a little bit
[10:46] more in that but i just felt not to go
[10:48] there to come back here so i thank god
[10:51] for that i just felt to go this
[10:52] direction i did and god sent sister
[10:54] jackie over to sing a song to let me
[10:56] know that we're on the right track amen
[10:59] so we thank god for that
[11:01] amen when we look at look at this the
[11:04] unexpected fulfillment we've been
[11:07] talking about how we have prophecies in
[11:09] the old testament and those old
[11:11] testament prophecies when it comes time
[11:13] for them to come into manifestation for
[11:15] the fulfillment of the prophecy that the
[11:17] fulfillment of the prophecy
[11:19] never looks like the intellectual
[11:22] understanding of that prophecy
[11:25] like
[11:26] we the best example the one that we've
[11:28] been using all the way through is when
[11:30] john the baptist came and john the
[11:32] baptist was the fulfillment of the
[11:33] prophecy out of isaiah and out of
[11:36] malachi amen behold i send my messenger
[11:38] before my face to prepare the way and
[11:41] isaiah he's going to make a highway in
[11:44] the wilderness he's going to make the
[11:46] high places low and the low place is
[11:47] high and the crooked priest is straight
[11:49] amen and he's going to do all of these
[11:51] things but but when you read those
[11:54] prophecies there's no way that when you
[11:56] read the prophecy in in understanding
[11:59] the language and being able to read the
[12:01] book there's no way that you can
[12:03] envision a man with a beard wrapped in
[12:06] camel's hair amen standing on the bank
[12:08] of jordan screaming for you to repent
[12:12] like when you read the prophecy you
[12:14] cannot come up with that picture
[12:17] and so
[12:18] then you can understand why it was easy
[12:21] to miss john the baptist ministry in
[12:23] fact the more intellectual you are and
[12:26] the more bible trained you were the more
[12:27] likely you were to miss it
[12:30] amen
[12:32] and even in jesus ministry jesus came as
[12:34] the fulfillment of the prophecies and
[12:37] the prophecy was speaking of one whom
[12:40] would sit on his father's throne as
[12:42] father david so he was going to come to
[12:44] be a king and he was going to the
[12:46] government was going to be upon his
[12:47] shoulder and he was going to be called
[12:49] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[12:52] prince of peace amen he was going these
[12:54] are all wonderful titles and when when
[12:56] you read those as a jew under bondage to
[12:59] rome and you begin to read that prophecy
[13:02] you can see how it'd be easy to envision
[13:04] a mighty warrior coming on the scene a
[13:06] mighty god in the flesh who will drive
[13:09] out amen the romans and set up the
[13:11] kingdom amen restore the kingdom and set
[13:13] up the throne of david
[13:15] and and that's why when jesus came
[13:17] humble and meek and he was lonely and
[13:20] born in a manger and raised up by
[13:22] obscure parents and even his birth had a
[13:24] had a suspicion about it amen
[13:27] and rumors that would fly all of these
[13:30] things when when you see that they could
[13:32] not they could not look at jesus and
[13:34] they could not see the prophecy out of
[13:36] isaiah
[13:38] but he was standing there fulfilling the
[13:40] prophecy out of isaiah so it has so the
[13:43] the prophecy has an unexpected
[13:45] fulfillment it's a fulfilled in an
[13:46] unexpected way and brother man said god
[13:49] often does things in an unusual way
[13:52] an unusual manner and the prophecy was
[13:54] filled exactly according to the word but
[13:58] not according to the predetermined
[14:00] conception and that's why when the
[14:02] predetermined conception and the
[14:04] fulfillment don't match the fulfillment
[14:06] is rejected and man holds on to his
[14:08] conception
[14:10] and that's why it's so dangerous amen to
[14:12] have everything already figured out
[14:17] amen it was dangerous in that day it's
[14:20] dangerous in this day amen but god amen
[14:24] he god interprets his word by bringing
[14:26] it to pass
[14:28] and when he brings it to pass he has a
[14:30] he has a mechanism called revelation
[14:32] amen where he can get the the revelation
[14:35] to his elect predestinated seed and he
[14:38] can reveal to them that this is the
[14:39] fulfillment of that
[14:42] and that's the only way that it ever
[14:44] works it doesn't work any other way
[14:46] study won't do it coercion won't do it
[14:49] threats won't do it force won't do it
[14:52] persuasive speech won't do it there's no
[14:54] other way to get somebody to recognize
[14:57] the word that's coming to manifest in
[14:58] their day other than for god to have a
[15:00] prophecy laid down in god to interpret
[15:03] his word by bringing it to pass and then
[15:05] when he brings it to pass he gives a
[15:06] gift of revelation a revelation that
[15:08] comes from the father that will open the
[15:11] eyes of his children to see that this is
[15:13] it
[15:17] amen
[15:18] so you can see why
[15:20] why all down through the bible what god
[15:23] was doing was always being missed by the
[15:25] masses
[15:27] every fulfillment you go down and look
[15:29] at every single fulfillment when god is
[15:32] fulfilling his word and he's working
[15:34] through a prophet he's fulfilling
[15:35] prophecy and he's bringing about
[15:37] everything that he prophesied to do amen
[15:39] in the fulfillment it's missed by the
[15:42] masses only a few ever received the
[15:44] fulfillment of god
[15:47] and as it's coming unfolded so we find
[15:50] ourselves in the same situation today
[15:52] amen god is god has fulfilled his word
[15:55] amen that he promised us in luke 17 30
[15:58] and in malachi i mean for god has
[16:01] already fulfilled that that's that's
[16:04] passed for us
[16:06] but most of the world doesn't know it
[16:08] only a few people know it amen because
[16:10] it came in an unexpected way
[16:13] it came through an unexpected source in
[16:15] an unexpected location in an unexpected
[16:17] way amen but why is it though the
[16:21] millions and billions of the people in
[16:23] the world cannot see that that ministry
[16:25] was the fulfillment of malachi 4 cannot
[16:28] see it was the fulfillment of luke 17
[16:30] 30. amen but you have no problem seeing
[16:33] that
[16:34] and you're less educated
[16:37] sorry
[16:39] not as well equipped not not as well
[16:42] known but for you it's no problem you
[16:44] say that's that amen malachi 4 i saw it
[16:47] amen luke 17 30 i witnessed it i believe
[16:50] that amen that wasn't from your
[16:52] intellect that wasn't from study or your
[16:54] ability to read the only way that you
[16:56] can get those two things together your
[16:59] revelation and the fulfillment of the
[17:00] word is because god has given you a
[17:02] revelation
[17:05] that's why it's hard to have a
[17:06] revelation of the word and be proud and
[17:08] arrogant
[17:11] because if you really caught a
[17:13] revelation of the word not because you
[17:15] agreed mentally you could see it and
[17:17] tied it together you could be really
[17:19] arrogant about those things because you
[17:20] tied it together somebody taught you and
[17:23] my dad and mom and pastor and i've got
[17:25] this thing all figured out amen that's
[17:27] not real revelation anything that thing
[17:29] will fizzle as soon as the fire gets
[17:31] close to it
[17:33] but when it comes to a real genuine
[17:35] revelation from god amen it'll stand the
[17:38] test of persecution it'll stand the
[17:40] questionings that come from the world
[17:42] and religious people and family it'll
[17:44] it'll take all of those things and at
[17:47] the end of the day you'll be able to say
[17:49] amen even though i can't always explain
[17:52] it i can't make you see it i know that
[17:55] this is true amen and there's no way you
[17:57] can get arrogant or puffed up about that
[17:59] because sometimes you can't even explain
[18:02] yourself
[18:04] it's not intellectual amen it's not any
[18:07] of those things it's something that god
[18:09] has given and when god gives it and you
[18:11] know that god gave it and you know you
[18:13] had nothing to do with it all you can
[18:15] say is thank you god for eyes to see and
[18:17] ears to hear
[18:19] i didn't do it myself i was incapable of
[18:21] doing him
[18:23] i think one of the greatest blessings
[18:25] amen that god has ever done for me is
[18:28] let me believe this message for 20 some
[18:30] years and while believing the message he
[18:32] let me get the wrong idea about things
[18:34] brother branham said
[18:38] amen
[18:39] and then would come and give me a
[18:40] revelation that would totally unravel my
[18:43] thinking so that i could see how flawed
[18:45] my intellectual understanding is and how
[18:48] perfect god's revelation is so that i
[18:50] will finally get to the point where says
[18:52] i don't know anything
[18:56] why the scripture says when you think
[18:57] you know something you know nothing as
[18:59] you ought
[19:00] so the minute you think you know
[19:02] something well i really know what that
[19:03] seventh seal is i'll tell you right now
[19:05] you don't know it like you ought to
[19:08] hey amen that's the truth
[19:12] no matter what if we think we know
[19:14] anything we don't know it as we ought to
[19:17] so praise be to god i said god help me
[19:20] to know it as i ought to
[19:23] amen
[19:24] i love
[19:26] the real the real so much different than
[19:28] the phony
[19:29] it brings such a different character it
[19:31] brings such a different uh attitude it
[19:34] brings such a different approach
[19:36] and i love the real
[19:38] let's turn to matthew 25 together
[19:58] matthew 25
[20:00] and i'll begin reading in verse 1.
[20:06] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[20:07] likened to the ten virgins which took
[20:09] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[20:11] bridegroom
[20:13] and five of them were wise and five were
[20:14] foolish
[20:16] they they were foolish took their lamps
[20:17] and took no oil with them but the wise
[20:19] took oil in their vessels with their
[20:21] lamps while the bridegroom tarried they
[20:24] all slumbered and slept
[20:25] and at midnight there was a cry made
[20:27] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[20:30] to meet him so that brother branham
[20:32] refers to all the time as the midnight
[20:33] cry amen that was the cry that brother
[20:36] branham gave amen he was the one crying
[20:38] behold the bridegroom cometh
[20:40] go out ye to meet him
[20:42] then all those virgins arose and trim
[20:44] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[20:46] the wise give us of your oil for our
[20:49] lamps are going out but the wise
[20:51] answered saying not so lest there be not
[20:53] enough for us and you but go you rather
[20:55] to them that sell and buy for yourselves
[20:58] and while they went to buy the
[20:59] bridegroom came
[21:01] and they that were ready went in with
[21:02] him to the marriage and the door was
[21:04] shut
[21:05] afterward came also the other virgin
[21:07] saying lord lord open to us but he
[21:10] answered and said verily i say unto you
[21:12] i know you not
[21:13] watch therefore for you know neither the
[21:16] day nor the hour wherein the son of man
[21:19] cometh
[21:20] amen brother branham preached on this
[21:22] quite a bit
[21:24] and if you know that
[21:26] and every time brother brennan preached
[21:27] on this he was not he he did not preach
[21:31] on this future tense he always preached
[21:33] this present tense
[21:35] he said do you see all the denominations
[21:37] going to try to buy oil he says when you
[21:39] see that that's when he comes amen and
[21:41] brother branham is showing that this
[21:44] this matthew 25 is taking place while
[21:47] he's on earth because he's the one with
[21:49] the with the midnight cry amen he's the
[21:52] one calling out the bridegroom cometh go
[21:54] you out to meet him and so that's that's
[21:57] his ministry amen calling the bride out
[22:00] amen at the coming of the lord to meet
[22:02] the lord and where is he calling them
[22:03] out of calling them out of the city
[22:05] calling them out what's the city it's a
[22:07] type of jerusalem it's a type of the old
[22:09] church system and he's calling them out
[22:11] of the church system calling him out of
[22:13] the laodicean system to go meet the lord
[22:17] and so they awoke and trimmed their
[22:19] lamps
[22:20] when the midnight cry went out so
[22:23] brother branham is is over and over and
[22:26] over he's relating this he's relating
[22:29] this matthew 25 to his day to his
[22:32] ministry to events that are taking place
[22:34] in his time
[22:37] amen
[22:38] just go and listen to what he says and
[22:40] he does it over and over and over again
[22:42] and he's calling you to go out to meet
[22:43] him and then some went to buy oil and
[22:45] brother bennett began to explain that he
[22:47] says you see these methodists and the
[22:48] presbyterians and neither the lutherans
[22:50] and catholics amen they're going to try
[22:52] to go get the holy ghost they're going
[22:54] out and looking for oil amen and they
[22:56] won't find it amen but they're all
[22:58] they're all looking there's been a great
[22:59] revival that have hit the land and
[23:01] they're all looking for something amen
[23:03] but they're missing the very the very
[23:05] source amen the very thing
[23:08] so then it comes and it says
[23:10] while they were gone looking for oil
[23:14] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[23:16] come
[23:16] came and they that were ready went in
[23:18] with him to the marriage
[23:23] and the door was shut
[23:27] they went in with him to the marriage
[23:32] hold that in your mind
[23:34] they went in with him those who came out
[23:37] to meet him who left the city to go out
[23:39] and meet him at the midnight cry
[23:44] they went with him into the marriage
[23:47] praise be to god
[23:51] in the message
[23:52] ashamed
[23:54] brother brennan this is from 1965
[23:57] brother graham said surely there is
[23:59] something in this word
[24:00] of god from genesis to revelation
[24:03] some character in there that you dealt
[24:05] with would be on some basis that would
[24:07] would be my question and if somebody
[24:09] done something and you go after them
[24:11] about it then let me turn to that place
[24:13] in the bible brother branham is asking
[24:15] god to answer something for him he's
[24:17] disturbed about something in his
[24:19] ministry and he wants an answer from the
[24:20] lord and he's saying surely in this
[24:23] bible you've dealt with somebody in a
[24:24] certain way you've corrected him you've
[24:26] said something that'll help me
[24:28] and so he's turning to the bible and
[24:30] asking god to give him an answer to his
[24:33] question
[24:34] and he said
[24:36] and if somebody whatever they done it'll
[24:39] lean my way where i've done wrong or
[24:42] something you want me to do or haven't
[24:44] done let me see some character in the
[24:45] bible like that
[24:47] i closed my eyes just let the bible fall
[24:50] open put my finger on the scripture
[24:52] genesis 24 7 eliezer abraham's faithful
[24:55] servant
[24:56] the model servant of the bible being
[24:58] sent to hunt the bride for isaac and
[25:00] brother bam says chills run over me
[25:04] i hope a few chills run over you
[25:07] because god is identifying this man's
[25:09] ministry and when god identifies this
[25:11] man's ministry his ministry is that of
[25:14] eliezer to go and hunt a bride for isaac
[25:17] so if god is identifying this man's
[25:19] ministry and this man's ministry came to
[25:22] you to call you out then who are you
[25:27] if you can identify that ministry and if
[25:29] god can identify that ministry and he
[25:32] says to chills he said chills run over
[25:34] me oh chills run over me friends amen
[25:37] because of he's eliezer and he come and
[25:40] called me and united me with somebody
[25:42] who am i and who am i united with what
[25:45] was he here doing
[25:49] chills run over me sure that's my that's
[25:53] right with the rest of my message
[25:55] pulling out the bride
[25:57] pulling him out by what a midnight cry
[25:59] behold the bridegroom cometh
[26:03] he said
[26:05] he goes back to the scripture he said
[26:06] swear that you'll not take a bride out
[26:09] of these but go to my own people he said
[26:11] what if the woman won't come with me
[26:13] said then you're free from this oath he
[26:15] said and the god of heaven will send his
[26:16] angel before you to direct you he went
[26:19] right straight out and begin praying and
[26:21] he met the beautiful rebecca that become
[26:23] the bride of isaac just a perfect
[26:25] message back to the word go get that
[26:28] bride that's a duty that's what i'm here
[26:31] for that's what i'm trying to do is call
[26:34] out a bride
[26:38] when was he calling out the bride when
[26:40] did the midnight call come when the
[26:43] bridegroom was coming
[26:46] it all happens at the same time let's go
[26:49] to revelation 19.
[26:59] revelation
[27:01] 19.
[27:09] and verse 6
[27:12] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[27:14] great multitude and as the voice of many
[27:16] waters and as the voice of mighty
[27:17] thunderings saying alleluia for the lord
[27:20] god omnipotent reigneth
[27:22] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[27:24] honor to him for the marriage of the
[27:26] lamb has come
[27:27] and his wife hath made herself ready and
[27:30] her was granted that she should be
[27:32] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[27:34] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[27:36] of the saints
[27:38] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[27:40] they which are called unto the married
[27:41] supper of the lamb and he saith unto me
[27:44] these are the true sayings of god
[27:47] so we read in this scripture that there
[27:49] was a there was a voice of many waters
[27:52] and thunderings crying hallelujah for
[27:54] the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us
[27:57] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[27:58] him for the marriage of the lamb has
[28:00] come and his wife hath made herself
[28:03] ready amen when we when we look at this
[28:06] call and then i would i would like to
[28:08] bring your attention to the fact that in
[28:11] the book of revelations and throughout
[28:12] the bible amen god is showing a prophecy
[28:16] amen through matthew 25 he's showing a
[28:19] prophecy of a midnight cry coming amen
[28:22] of of wise virgins going in when when he
[28:25] cometh and going in with him he shows a
[28:27] prophecy here or he shows a fulfillment
[28:29] in revelation 19 amen the marriage of
[28:32] the lamb is come and the bride hath made
[28:35] herself ready amen but when i look
[28:37] through the scriptures and i look
[28:39] through them i never see the actual
[28:41] marriage
[28:45] where do you see the actual marriage
[28:49] it's a mystery in the bible
[28:52] it's hidden
[28:54] you see that the marriage has come and
[28:56] the bride has made herself ready and
[28:57] describes that she's ready
[29:00] but
[29:02] who's doing the ceremony who says what
[29:05] what's happening there's a mystery amen
[29:08] you don't see the marriage in the bible
[29:11] you see the preparation you see the
[29:13] calling amen you see the the bridegroom
[29:15] call you see the virgins go out and they
[29:17] go in with them into the marriage you
[29:20] see amen the the bride and her
[29:22] preparation and she's now made herself
[29:24] ready but you don't see the marriage
[29:26] because the marriage is in secret amen
[29:28] it's hidden amen
[29:30] it's even hidden in the bible
[29:34] these things are written this way for a
[29:36] reason
[29:38] amen and i want to look at this quote
[29:41] and proving his word and i just want to
[29:43] keep working with this thought as we
[29:45] meditate on it
[29:46] proving his word now we say he's raised
[29:48] from the dead i didn't say it the weird
[29:51] word here said it
[29:52] he raised from the dead he says he's the
[29:54] same yesterday
[29:56] yesterday same yesterday and forever you
[29:58] believe that he promised these things to
[30:00] happen in the last days the same son of
[30:02] man will be made manifest now the same
[30:05] son of man will be made manifest is that
[30:07] true
[30:08] in the last days was the same son of man
[30:10] made manifest
[30:12] but was he made manifest in the same
[30:14] vessel
[30:16] now he was made manifest and another
[30:18] vessel he's made manifest in the prophet
[30:20] of the age but it's the same son of man
[30:24] and we realize that when god goes to
[30:27] fulfill his word and he and he brings
[30:29] his word to pass amen he he doesn't do
[30:31] it according to our intellectual
[30:33] understanding because we have a certain
[30:35] expectation amen if if this is going to
[30:38] be the coming of the son of man and
[30:40] revealing himself then we're looking for
[30:43] that same vessel that same one amen but
[30:46] but that that one who died amen at
[30:49] calvary jesus christ and the flesh he
[30:52] rose again and he showed himself to his
[30:53] disciples but when when
[30:56] when when when the one disciple
[30:59] thomas
[31:00] when thomas he said i won't believe
[31:03] until i can put my fingers in the nail
[31:05] prints and thrust my hand into his side
[31:08] so jesus presents himself to disciples
[31:10] and said thomas come and put thy finger
[31:12] in my hand and thrust thy hand on my
[31:14] side and thomas says my my god amen he
[31:17] calls him god he recognizes who this is
[31:19] but jesus said because you see you
[31:22] believe but blessed is those who don't
[31:24] see and believe
[31:29] because we're moving from jewish faith
[31:31] to gentile faith and the gentile faith
[31:33] does not have to have the tangible
[31:35] physical like the jewish does to believe
[31:38] [Music]
[31:40] thomas was a jew he had to see the
[31:42] resurrected lord he had to touch his his
[31:45] nail prints he had to thrust his side
[31:47] but you and i will not get that
[31:49] privilege amen to touch that amen in
[31:51] this dispensation of time but yet i
[31:54] believe he's here every bit just the
[31:56] same
[31:57] and there was a blessing amen to come on
[32:00] those who would not see yet believe
[32:04] that's why paul the apostle in his
[32:05] ministry paul is constantly he's
[32:07] preaching to the gentiles and he's
[32:09] constantly taking things that were
[32:11] physical to the jews and he's making
[32:13] them spiritual to the gentiles
[32:16] and this is paul's ministry paul paul is
[32:19] taking an exodus an actual physical
[32:22] exodus where they left egypt in slavery
[32:25] amen and they moved through physical
[32:26] land and they had physical manna come
[32:28] and physical water come out of a rock
[32:30] and brother paul takes that amen and he
[32:34] takes that same thing and he types it to
[32:36] what was going on in their day
[32:38] and said that was done for our example
[32:40] so that we would know how to conduct
[32:41] ourselves
[32:43] and not to fail the way they failed
[32:46] it's paul in hebrews 12 says you've not
[32:48] come to a mountain that can be touched
[32:50] that burns with fire but you've come to
[32:53] mount zion
[32:54] he's saying you've come to a mountain
[32:56] but not a mountain you can touch
[32:59] so the question is did you come to a
[33:00] mountain like they went to a mountain
[33:02] absolutely just the same thing is
[33:04] happening in this dispensation that
[33:06] happened under moses but moses was the
[33:09] physical paul is bringing it to the
[33:11] supernatural the spiritual fulfillment
[33:15] god gave them a sign of circumcision
[33:18] amen now paul takes circumcision and
[33:20] makes it spiritual circumcision the
[33:22] circumcision of the heart
[33:24] is that right
[33:26] jesus tells them that you must eat my my
[33:29] flesh and you must drink my blood but
[33:31] the apostle paul sorts that out and
[33:33] shows that the elements in communion are
[33:35] symbolic of a spiritual partaking amen
[33:39] of his word and of his life
[33:42] is that right
[33:44] so we've we as gentiles
[33:47] all the way down through 2 000 years of
[33:49] church history have not had a problem
[33:51] recognizing our circumcision is an
[33:53] invisible circumcision
[33:56] our communion is in a visible communion
[33:59] all of the armor that we armored with
[34:01] the shield the helmet it's all invisible
[34:06] we've had no problem for 2000 years that
[34:08] the mount zion we've come to the great
[34:10] company of angels to the blood of the
[34:12] lamb it was all invisible
[34:15] and we've had no problem with that
[34:19] amen
[34:22] so
[34:22] so
[34:23] being gentiles we shouldn't have
[34:26] problems believing what you don't see
[34:30] when the word is fulfilled they meant
[34:33] it's fulfilled amen we don't have to see
[34:36] to believe we have to see the
[34:38] fulfillment and by revelation we can say
[34:40] that's it
[34:44] a
[34:45] amen
[34:48] so brother branham is saying now and
[34:50] continue in proving his word
[34:52] he says now remember
[34:54] that was not jesus talking to abraham
[34:56] there that could discern the thoughts in
[34:58] sarah's mind behind him that was not
[35:00] jesus he had not been born he had not
[35:02] yet been born but it was a man in human
[35:05] flesh that abraham called elohim the
[35:07] great almighty
[35:08] and jesus says as it was in the days of
[35:11] sodom now watch close
[35:13] in the days of sodom so will it be at
[35:14] the coming of the son of man when the
[35:17] son of man is being revealed not no more
[35:19] as church seed not no more the bride is
[35:21] called see
[35:23] in that day the son of man will be
[35:26] revealed what to join the church to the
[35:29] head unite the marriage of the bride
[35:34] so what was this revelation of the son
[35:36] of man to do it was to unite the
[35:38] headship of christ the word has come
[35:40] back to the bride that's been called out
[35:42] of the churches amen there's a calling
[35:44] out and there's a coming
[35:47] just like matthew 25
[35:50] there's a calling out come out to meet
[35:53] him and there's a coming of the headship
[35:56] that right so we have a coming and a
[35:59] coming out and when you come out and he
[36:01] comes then you meet and it unites the
[36:03] two together in the marriage of the
[36:04] bride
[36:06] that's what this ministry and brother
[36:09] branham was supposed to do this eleazar
[36:11] was supposed to fetch a bride for isaac
[36:13] and breeding the bride all the way to
[36:16] isaac amen his the eliezer ministry was
[36:18] not just to say hey you're the bride but
[36:21] to bring the bride all the way to a
[36:23] union with christ
[36:26] that what eliezer did
[36:28] amen so this
[36:29] has been revealed now this the day of
[36:32] the son of man will be revealed what to
[36:34] join the church to the head
[36:36] unite the marriage of the bride the
[36:39] bridegroom call will come right through
[36:41] this
[36:42] what bridegroom call the midnight cry
[36:44] matthew 25.
[36:46] we'll come right through this when the
[36:48] son of man will come down
[36:53] behold
[36:54] the bridegroom cometh
[36:57] the son of man will come down and come
[36:59] in human flesh to unite the two together
[37:03] what's the uniting two together that's
[37:05] the marriage
[37:07] of the bride
[37:10] the church has to be the word he is the
[37:12] word and the two unites together and to
[37:14] do that it'll take the manifestation of
[37:17] the revealing of the son of man not a
[37:19] clergyman
[37:20] do you see what i mean it's son of man
[37:22] jesus christ will come down in human
[37:24] flesh among us and we'll make his word
[37:26] so real that it'll unite the church and
[37:28] him as one the bride and then shall go
[37:31] home to the wedding supper amen she's
[37:33] already united
[37:36] see we go to the wedding supper not to
[37:39] the marriage
[37:43] so where's the marriage it's got to be
[37:45] here amen what's the marriage it's the
[37:48] invisible union of the bride in christ
[37:50] that's the marriage the son of the
[37:52] revealing of the son of man has come to
[37:54] unite the the coming of the son of man
[37:57] and unite the bride that's come out and
[37:59] take the headship in the body and put it
[38:01] together in a union that is the marriage
[38:08] some people won't get married until the
[38:10] wedding supper
[38:12] too late amen you've got to get married
[38:15] now
[38:18] some people want to wait to see
[38:20] something to get married amen this is an
[38:22] invisible union remember the words of
[38:25] the prophet amen don't wait to see
[38:27] something to get married when you've
[38:29] seen the revelation of the son of man
[38:31] then you know that the revelation of the
[38:33] son of man is what the bridegroom call
[38:35] came through
[38:37] the midnight cry came through this
[38:39] revelation of the son of man and this
[38:41] revelation of the son of man has come to
[38:43] unite to first it's an eliezer to call
[38:46] out a bride to isaac to bring a bride
[38:48] out amen the bridegroom call and then
[38:51] amen to bring the headship of the word
[38:54] down and the bride that's called out
[38:56] together and this ministry was to unite
[38:59] the two together
[39:04] praise god
[39:11] she's already united
[39:14] we go to the wedding supper not to the
[39:16] marriage
[39:17] see
[39:18] feel yourself of the flesh of mighty men
[39:20] because the marriage of the lamb has
[39:21] come but the rapture is going to the
[39:23] wedding supper when the word here unites
[39:25] with the person and they too become one
[39:27] and then what does it do then it
[39:29] manifests the son of man again not the
[39:31] church theologians the son of man the
[39:33] word and the church becomes one whatever
[39:36] the son of man done he was the word the
[39:38] church does the same thing
[39:41] so now
[39:42] it's it's easy we've talked about these
[39:44] things many times this is old news but i
[39:47] just love it it doesn't get old to me
[39:50] we see in the ministry amen of the
[39:52] revealing of the son of man through a
[39:54] prophet we've heard the midnight call
[39:56] we've seen the ministry of eliezer and
[39:58] so we can get so fixated on the ministry
[40:01] of eleazar and the midnight cry amen and
[40:04] the in the uh the revealing of the son
[40:06] of man that we miss that all of that
[40:09] came to do something to me
[40:12] all of that came to unite me amen first
[40:15] it came to call me out
[40:18] to get me to leave that church condition
[40:20] amen to get me to leave it behind so it
[40:23] came to call me out to recognize that
[40:25] he's come amen and then they come to
[40:28] unite the two together amen so that i
[40:30] can go with him into the marriage
[40:33] praise god
[40:35] let's go to revelation chapter 3.
[40:41] revelation chapter 3 verse 14.
[40:53] and unto the angel of the church of the
[40:54] laodiceans write these things saith thee
[40:56] amen the faithful and true witness the
[40:58] beginning of the creation of god i know
[41:01] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[41:03] hot i would that were cold or hot so
[41:05] then because thou art lukewarm and
[41:07] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[41:09] out of my mouth because thou sayest i am
[41:11] rich and increased with goods and have
[41:14] need of nothing and know us not thou are
[41:16] wretched and miserable poor and blind
[41:19] and naked
[41:20] i counseled thee the buy of me gold
[41:22] tried the fire that thou mayest be rich
[41:24] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[41:26] clothed
[41:27] see when we read in revelations 19 amen
[41:30] she was clothed in white raiment which
[41:32] is the righteousness of the saints and
[41:34] here in the laodicean church age amen
[41:38] christ is trying to get her amen to
[41:40] recognize you're you're not clothed amen
[41:43] you're miserable you're wretched amen
[41:45] but come to me buy of me gold buy of me
[41:48] raiment amen i've got something to
[41:50] clothe you with
[41:53] i've got something to give you wealth
[41:55] i've got something to close you clothe
[41:56] you with in this age
[41:59] amen i'll read verse 18 again i
[42:02] counseled you to buy of me gold tried in
[42:03] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[42:05] white raiment that thou mayest be
[42:06] clothed and that the shame of thy
[42:08] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[42:10] eyes with eyes out that thou mayest see
[42:12] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[42:14] be zealous therefore and repent behold i
[42:18] stand at the door and knock if any man
[42:20] hear my voice and open the door i will
[42:22] come into him and will sup with him and
[42:25] he with me
[42:26] to him that overcometh what i grant to
[42:28] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[42:30] overcome and sit down with my father in
[42:32] his throne he that hath an ear let him
[42:35] hear what the spirit saith to the
[42:36] churches so here we find in the end time
[42:39] and the laodicean church age we find
[42:41] christ on the outside of the church
[42:43] knocking amen and that's why brother
[42:46] branham starts preaching and paul starts
[42:48] preaching in i think it's hebrew 13 he
[42:51] said he suffered outside the gate now
[42:53] let us go in unto him without the gate
[42:56] bearing his reproach and you see
[42:58] everything in this laodicean age shows
[43:01] that in laodicea there is a wretched
[43:04] naked miserable condition but there's
[43:06] got to be a calling out amen to have the
[43:09] gold and the raiment and the isaf and
[43:11] all of that you've got to go out to
[43:12] where he is and he is on the outside
[43:16] which matches matthew 25
[43:19] which matches eliezer because he has to
[43:22] bring her out
[43:24] amen when he brings her out he gives her
[43:27] all kinds of gold and he gives her
[43:28] arraignment he gives her all kinds of
[43:30] stuff and then she gets all the gifts
[43:32] and then she gets brought out so
[43:33] everything is lining up for this final
[43:36] age that you have to come out and you
[43:38] have to be clothed with the garment
[43:40] that's provided
[43:43] and you've got to be called out he says
[43:45] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[43:47] any man hear my
[43:49] voice
[43:52] if any man hear my voice
[43:55] what's he knocking with he's knocking
[43:57] with a voice and that voice is the
[44:00] midnight cry amen it is the one with the
[44:02] revelation of the son of man it is
[44:05] malachi 4 it is the voice amen if anyone
[44:08] hear my voice
[44:11] then you come out
[44:12] and become one with him
[44:16] amen in 1964 the prophet says when their
[44:18] eyes were opened they knew him and that
[44:20] message he says so it is today the god
[44:23] that they claim that they believe that
[44:25] manifest himself
[44:26] you will shut up every door no
[44:28] cooperation cooperation no nothing else
[44:31] it's contrary to their creeds oh fools
[44:33] and slow of hearing to know the day that
[44:35] we live in has not god promised this in
[44:37] the last day how this laodicean church
[44:40] would be lukewarm and jesus on the
[44:41] outside trying to get in for a little
[44:43] cooperation what is what is jesus the
[44:47] word the true word that's made manifest
[44:49] on the outside trying to get in and
[44:52] couldn't get in
[44:54] amen he come in the last day he come in
[44:56] the end time and he could not get in
[44:58] they would not let the word into the
[45:00] system amen they rejected it and that's
[45:02] why brother branham could come in 1963
[45:05] and preach indictment and i indict this
[45:07] bunch of clergy i indict this generation
[45:10] for the second crucifixion of jesus
[45:12] christ
[45:13] by what by by crucifying the effects of
[45:16] the word amen because the word was
[45:17] restored which is nothing more than
[45:19] jesus christ amen and they rejected
[45:22] christ in the laodicean age and left him
[45:25] on the outside amen and there's a
[45:26] bridegroom call saying the bridegroom
[45:29] cometh come out to meet him
[45:33] now he suffered without the gate because
[45:35] they wouldn't let him in and they
[45:36] crucified him afresh
[45:40] so now we must go to him without the
[45:43] gate bearing his
[45:44] reproach what reproach are we bearing
[45:47] the same reproach that moses bore in his
[45:50] day because moses amen he forsook egypt
[45:53] and all the riches thereof amen
[45:56] esteeming the reproaches of christ
[45:58] greater riches than all of egypt so
[46:00] moses had to leave egypt and go out to
[46:03] bear the reproach of christ
[46:06] we have to leave laodicea and leave the
[46:09] church systems leave the denominational
[46:11] system and go out and bear his reproach
[46:14] well was he in moses's day he was the
[46:18] word made manifest for that day and
[46:20] moses went with that word that prophecy
[46:23] coming to fulfillment and he had to bear
[46:25] the reproach of that word coming flesh
[46:27] in his day
[46:29] there's nothing different in our day
[46:31] we're bearing the reproach for the word
[46:32] made flesh in our day
[46:36] so the bridegroom call
[46:38] tells us he's come he's coming come out
[46:42] to meet him
[46:45] amen
[46:47] in the message the present stage in my
[46:49] ministry says well
[46:51] all men has forsaken me
[46:54] but there's one thing he stood by me
[46:57] i wasn't disobedient to the heavenly
[46:59] vision that happened down there on the
[47:00] river i've stayed true to him he's been
[47:03] true to me

[47:07] know when for a crowning of my ministry
[47:09] i've stayed just as true as i could be i
[47:12] don't know what it'll be i don't know
[47:15] when it'll be and just when he's ready
[47:17] i'm done up here i hope that he will
[47:20] crown my ministry of this
[47:22] of letting me take the clothes of the
[47:24] word and dress his bride in the clothes
[47:26] of the word and for his righteousness
[47:31] i hope he will crown me let me stand on
[47:33] that day say behold the lamb of god that
[47:35] takes away the sin of the world

[47:43] me take the clothes of the word
[47:47] and he lets me dress his bride in the
[47:49] clothes of the word hey listen we know

[1:01:12] the fiery darts of the enemy

[1:01:17] just because it's invisible doesn't mean
[1:01:18] it's not great just because it's
[1:01:20] invisible doesn't mean it's not powerful
[1:01:22] just because it's invisible doesn't mean
[1:01:24] it's not greater than anything you can
[1:01:26] see
[1:01:28] it doesn't mean it wasn't a it's not a
[1:01:29] great event it doesn't mean it's not

[1:01:33] not pure white which is your
[1:01:34] righteousness which what is it it's the
[1:01:36] righteousness of god which is his word

[1:03:05] they had to go and consummate the
[1:03:06] marriage he had to take her into the
[1:03:09] marriage first before the marriage
[1:03:11] supper started
[1:03:13] and after they went into the bridal
[1:03:15] chamber and consummated marriage after
[1:03:17] that that's when the wedding supper
[1:03:19] started
[1:03:22] that's why don't try to wait for the
[1:03:24] wedding supper to get married amen it's
[1:03:26] private it's in the little room it's in
[1:03:28] the bridal chamber it's just the
[1:03:30] bridegroom and the bride that's it
[1:03:34] nobody's invited into the marriage
[1:03:36] everybody's invited to the wedding
[1:03:37] supper but the marriage is private
[1:03:44] go to genesis 24.
[1:03:52] i would say
[1:03:54] maybe it's fair to say this
[1:03:57] that the marriage of the lamb is an
[1:03:58] unexpected fulfillment
[1:04:03] i don't even know how the denominations
[1:04:04] teach this because when i was there they
[1:04:05] weren't even talking about that part
[1:04:08] they left those things alone
[1:04:10] but what's the denominational idea of
[1:04:12] the marriage of the lamb you know what
[1:04:14] their idea is it's humongous
[1:04:18] but in reality
[1:04:20] it's invisible
[1:04:23] let's look at
[1:04:24] eleazar bringing rebecca back in genesis
[1:04:27] 24 we know all that happens there it's a
[1:04:29] familiar story but i want to look here i
[1:04:31] want to start a
[1:04:33] paragraph or verse 63 sorry
[1:04:37] genesis chapter 24
[1:04:39] 63.
[1:04:41] now if you'll let me do this just just
[1:04:44] just for fun just let me do this for fun
[1:04:46] don't make a doctrine out of this
[1:04:48] but let's take 63 as
[1:04:52] 1963. and isaac went out to meditate in
[1:04:55] the field at the eventing and he lifted
[1:04:57] up his eyes and saw behold the camels
[1:04:59] were coming
[1:05:01] so where was he at amen he went out into
[1:05:03] field amen in the evening time
[1:05:06] the evening time message
[1:05:09] and in the evening time he goes out to
[1:05:11] the field to watch for her to come amen
[1:05:13] and and he's out not at home he's
[1:05:16] between home and between her place he's
[1:05:19] between heaven and between earth maybe
[1:05:21] like a cloud in 1963
[1:05:27] so let me just do this for fun don't
[1:05:28] make a doctrine out of it 1963 isaac
[1:05:32] went out to meditate in the field at
[1:05:34] evening time and he lifted up his eyes
[1:05:36] and saw behold the camels were coming
[1:05:38] 1964 and rebecca lifted up her eyes when
[1:05:41] she saw isaac she
[1:05:43] went lifted up her eyes and when she saw
[1:05:45] isaac she lighted off the camel
[1:05:48] in 1965 for she had said unto the
[1:05:50] servant what man is this that walketh in
[1:05:53] the field to meet us and the servant
[1:05:55] that said it is my master therefore she
[1:05:57] took a veil and covered herself
[1:06:00] it was 1965 when brother branham was
[1:06:03] told to take the picture and turn it to
[1:06:05] the right
[1:06:06] amen because the identification of isaac
[1:06:08] comes to the bride in 1965 that's a
[1:06:11] cloud that's a pyramid that's a capstone
[1:06:13] that's seven angels and she says who is
[1:06:15] that in the field up there and the
[1:06:17] prophet eliezer says told turn it to the
[1:06:20] right and said it's my lord up there
[1:06:22] it's isaac in 1965.
[1:06:28] this is fun for me
[1:06:32] 1966 brother ben is now off the scene
[1:06:34] he's not speaking to rebecca anymore
[1:06:38] and the servant told isaac all things
[1:06:39] that he had done it's like he goes home
[1:06:41] and makes a report or something
[1:06:44] 1967 and isaac brought her unto his
[1:06:47] mother sarah's tent
[1:06:49] and took rebecca and she became his wife
[1:06:52] and he loved her and isaac was comforted
[1:06:54] after his mother's death
[1:06:59] this is
[1:07:00] the wedding
[1:07:01] of the promised son
[1:07:05] this is the marriage of the promised son
[1:07:08] elias are fetched a bride eliezer went
[1:07:11] and got the bride eliezer showered her
[1:07:14] with gifts and then brought her back on
[1:07:15] a camel train brought her back on all
[1:07:17] this stuff but when she comes back amen
[1:07:20] in the evening time amen he comes out
[1:07:23] amen not not in the heavens and not on
[1:07:26] the earth but kind of in between
[1:07:30] she lifts up her eyes and she sees the
[1:07:32] clown and in 1965 she had asked who is
[1:07:36] this amen and eliezer says it's my lord
[1:07:39] up there
[1:07:42] it's the promised son
[1:07:44] and she wrapped a veil around herself
[1:07:47] she veiled herself in that word she had
[1:07:50] got while she was writing with eleazar
[1:07:52] all that time and she went to meet her
[1:07:54] and here comes the climax here comes the
[1:07:56] marriage here comes where she's going to
[1:07:58] become his wife amen how many attendants
[1:08:01] how many guests where's abraham where's
[1:08:03] the musicians where's everything all he
[1:08:05] does is take her after she leaves la's
[1:08:08] or eliezer gives a report and he takes
[1:08:10] her into the tent and she becomes his
[1:08:12] wife
[1:08:16] i thought the marriage of abraham
[1:08:17] abraham was a very wealthy man
[1:08:21] i thought the marriage of abraham would
[1:08:22] be a bigger deal than this
[1:08:25] i thought there would be
[1:08:27] lots of people
[1:08:30] i thought there would be i mean slain
[1:08:32] oxes and slain calves and
[1:08:35] milk or pouring in wine by the plenty
[1:08:38] and all the things that you would expect
[1:08:40] when the promised sign amen got this
[1:08:42] wife that this this faithful servant
[1:08:44] went and fetched in a far country and
[1:08:46] brought back through a journey amen and
[1:08:48] on all of this effort and isaac just
[1:08:51] takes her to himself and he goes into
[1:08:52] the tent
[1:08:54] just the two of them
[1:08:57] and she becomes his wife
[1:08:59] oh praise god
[1:09:01] don't miss the marriage
[1:09:05] it's that simple
[1:09:08] it's that profound and that simple
[1:09:11] it's that great
[1:09:13] and that simple
[1:09:20] the message marriage and divorce now
[1:09:21] brother ben is preached in 1965 he says
[1:09:25] he went right on revealing his word to
[1:09:27] the body and vindicating him
[1:09:29] him saying by himself his children begin
[1:09:31] to kind of look more like him because
[1:09:33] it's fully maturing they become children
[1:09:35] of the word not children of the church
[1:09:37] children of the word and the bride will
[1:09:39] be a lovely little lady of the word
[1:09:41] unadulterated not touched by any man's
[1:09:43] organization any man-made theory she'll
[1:09:45] be purely unadulterated bride of the
[1:09:47] word amen amen i hope you get that on
[1:09:50] the air she'll be the pregnant daughter
[1:09:53] of god
[1:09:56] what's this brother brandon talking
[1:09:57] about a pregnant bride
[1:10:00] i want to see the ceremony first amen
[1:10:05] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[1:10:07] said
[1:10:08] the head was took from the grave so must
[1:10:10] the body follow him back to eden where
[1:10:12] the head of the family the man the
[1:10:13] bridegroom the bride being the body of
[1:10:15] the bridegroom must follow the bride
[1:10:17] because that's the head and the head is
[1:10:19] revealed and come back with eternal life
[1:10:21] and the body must follow that because
[1:10:23] it's husband and wife again and as long
[1:10:25] as you're pregnanted with the same word
[1:10:27] which is his body you took his body
[1:10:30] become him when you took the word
[1:10:34] one more choosing of a bride the other
[1:10:37] is pregnanted by the word of god and
[1:10:38] will bring forth the body the finished
[1:10:40] body of jesus christ which is the bride
[1:10:47] brother branham has got so far past the
[1:10:49] marriage now
[1:10:53] he's here in 1965 and he's preaching a
[1:10:56] pregnant bride pregnated by the word
[1:10:58] who's come in union with her husband the
[1:11:00] two have united as one she's received
[1:11:03] his word amen and now she is bringing
[1:11:05] forth the finished body of jesus christ
[1:11:08] which is the bride
[1:11:10] i want to see the finished body of jesus
[1:11:12] christ
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:19] look to the right look to the left
[1:11:22] don't miss it amen don't miss what he's
[1:11:25] doing don't miss how great this is this
[1:11:28] there's been a marriage there's been an
[1:11:29] impregnation of the word and now there's
[1:11:31] a bride who's bringing forth the
[1:11:33] finished body of jesus christ which is
[1:11:36] the bride the bride manifestation is the
[1:11:38] finishing of the body of jesus christ
[1:11:42] but she had to unite with the head she
[1:11:44] had to come into the invisible union she
[1:11:46] had to receive the word and be pregnant
[1:11:49] by the word and now she has to bring
[1:11:51] forth the word and manifestation for
[1:11:53] this day which is in bright form
[1:11:58] amen the body of christ isn't finished
[1:12:00] yet how many knows that a man and his
[1:12:02] woman is one and christ is one body the
[1:12:04] word the bride will have to be the rest
[1:12:06] of that body
[1:12:07] and the two together makes the one body
[1:12:09] again like adam was at the beginning man
[1:12:12] his wife are one now she the true bride
[1:12:14] so sold out to him that she uses no mind
[1:12:16] of her own and his mind of course is his
[1:12:19] word and his word his will
[1:12:21] is his word
[1:12:24] this bride
[1:12:26] she's been washed she's been called
[1:12:29] washed clothed united
[1:12:32] impregnated
[1:12:35] and now she's bringing forth the
[1:12:37] finished body of jesus christ
[1:12:43] but i didn't see anything
[1:12:45] i did
[1:12:50] you realize when it comes to the third
[1:12:52] pool it doesn't matter what anybody else
[1:12:54] sees
[1:12:56] when it comes to the seventh seal in the
[1:12:58] third pool it matters not what the
[1:12:59] masses see because there was a lot of
[1:13:01] people in that tent that day
[1:13:04] and even the prophet of god was raised
[1:13:06] up in an elevated position looking down
[1:13:08] and the prophet of god and all the
[1:13:10] people had no idea what was happening in
[1:13:12] that little room
[1:13:15] they couldn't describe to you what was
[1:13:16] happening they couldn't explain what was
[1:13:18] happening and the people who were
[1:13:19] walking through the room they were
[1:13:21] undergoing a complete change they were
[1:13:23] changing they were being transformed
[1:13:25] they were being made new again and they
[1:13:27] were coming out the other side and they
[1:13:28] couldn't even explain to you what
[1:13:30] happened in that little room all that
[1:13:31] they knew is they were changed
[1:13:36] this one is not a public show
[1:13:40] and this union is not a public show for
[1:13:43] it takes place in the bridal chamber
[1:13:45] with only the bridegroom and only the
[1:13:47] bride
[1:13:51] everybody is looking for something big
[1:13:55] it is big
[1:13:58] it's huge
[1:14:01] it's bigger than the earth turning on
[1:14:03] its axis
[1:14:05] it's bigger than that
[1:14:08] did you see the earth turning did you
[1:14:09] feel it
[1:14:11] did you know it was turning how did you
[1:14:12] know it was turning well other people
[1:14:14] explained it to me i mean how did you
[1:14:16] prove it
[1:14:17] did you feel it
[1:14:19] did you go far enough away to see it
[1:14:22] no
[1:14:24] this is bigger than that
[1:14:28] but under the third pool
[1:14:30] it doesn't matter what anybody else sees
[1:14:34] when it comes to the third pool you
[1:14:36] cannot rely on what anybody else sees
[1:14:41] in the third pull all that matters is
[1:14:44] what you see
[1:14:48] amen i don't care amen on that day when
[1:14:52] people saw virgins leaving the city amen
[1:14:55] they saw lamps going through the dark
[1:14:57] they heard a noise the bridegroom coming
[1:14:59] they saw and heard all of this amen it
[1:15:01] doesn't matter what the descriptions are
[1:15:03] what they heard one thing they didn't
[1:15:05] know and one thing they didn't see and
[1:15:07] one thing they could not explain is what
[1:15:09] happened after he closed the door
[1:15:13] and i say under the third pull
[1:15:16] all that matters is what you see
[1:15:21] and what you
[1:15:22] see amen is only given to you by the
[1:15:26] revelation of god
[1:15:30] and if you see
[1:15:32] by god's revelation
[1:15:34] if you know that you've entered into the
[1:15:36] marriage with the lamb
[1:15:38] amen then it doesn't matter what anybody
[1:15:41] else says
[1:15:44] because you were there and when they ask
[1:15:46] you to explain it you've got a really
[1:15:48] good thorough pulled vision that gives
[1:15:49] you the right to say i can't explain it
[1:15:53] because in the vision they couldn't
[1:15:54] explain it
[1:15:56] it's not always explainable
[1:15:59] you can talk about it but you can't
[1:16:01] explain it amen
[1:16:02] you can point to it amen you can try to
[1:16:05] talk all around it amen but it's you and
[1:16:08] jesus christ becoming persons together
[1:16:11] it's an invisible union
[1:16:14] man i'd like to finish this in isaiah 62
[1:16:17] if we could turn there
[1:16:28] i'd like for you to just think for me
[1:16:30] for with me for a moment
[1:16:35] those who have gone in
[1:16:38] to the marriage
[1:16:39] with the lamb
[1:16:42] they know it they've experienced it
[1:16:47] and you know
[1:16:49] it doesn't so much matter what anybody
[1:16:51] else says or anybody else thinks anymore
[1:16:54] because it's my experience
[1:16:56] and you can see how necessary the third
[1:16:59] pool is now
[1:17:01] because the third pull of the ministry
[1:17:03] is the opening of the word and it's a
[1:17:04] revelation to you of who jesus christ is
[1:17:07] and it's a union of you in christ an
[1:17:10] invisible union
[1:17:12] and the reason brother them saw in the
[1:17:14] little room and couldn't describe it
[1:17:16] because he wasn't allowed to talk about
[1:17:18] him when he comes to the seventh seal he
[1:17:20] he feels to stop he's not going to
[1:17:22] explain it he's good he's going to tell
[1:17:24] you about
[1:17:26] visions and about things that happen but
[1:17:27] he can't tell it to you amen because
[1:17:30] when you come down to the third pool
[1:17:32] amen god is trying to build a security
[1:17:36] in the church that nothing else can
[1:17:38] create
[1:17:40] because if there's an explanation
[1:17:43] somebody else can have a different
[1:17:44] explanation
[1:17:46] if there's a picture painted in the
[1:17:48] bible amen even if the marriage is
[1:17:51] described in the bible you can have
[1:17:53] different interpretations so in the
[1:17:54] bible you don't ever see an explanation
[1:17:56] of the marriage you just see the bride's
[1:17:59] prepared the marriage has come what
[1:18:01] happened i don't know the bridegroom
[1:18:02] call has come they go out and meet him
[1:18:04] went in what happened i don't know
[1:18:06] it's not described in the bible amen
[1:18:08] brother branham couldn't talk about it
[1:18:10] what happened in the little room nobody
[1:18:12] could explain what is god trying to do
[1:18:15] he's trying to break us off a need for
[1:18:17] camaraderie and somebody to believe like
[1:18:20] i believe and somebody to be able to
[1:18:21] explain it to me and for an intellectual
[1:18:24] reason he's trying to break us from all
[1:18:26] the denominational holds and under the
[1:18:28] third pull the third pull not being
[1:18:30] explained explainable being private
[1:18:32] between you and jesus christ is to do
[1:18:34] one thing it's to get you so solidly
[1:18:36] rooted in a private revelation amen that
[1:18:39] nobody can move you ever again
[1:18:41] no sway of denomination no system no
[1:18:44] intellectual speeches he's trying to
[1:18:46] break the church free from that
[1:18:49] and unite her to himself
[1:18:54] because there's many times i thought
[1:18:56] i don't get it explain it tell me teach
[1:18:58] me amen if he had somebody would explain
[1:19:01] something else
[1:19:05] but it comes down so
[1:19:06] personal to a relationship with me in
[1:19:09] christ
[1:19:11] that i've met him
[1:19:12] and he's revealed himself to me
[1:19:15] and nobody can take that away from me
[1:19:20] the opening of the word the seventh seal
[1:19:21] has become real to me can you explain it
[1:19:24] really well no i can't explain it really
[1:19:26] well every time i try eventually i run
[1:19:29] out somewhere and i run out of words
[1:19:32] i run out of examples but but it doesn't
[1:19:35] matter amen it's me and my lord it's him
[1:19:39] coming for me it's me hearing the
[1:19:41] bridegroom call getting the garment on
[1:19:43] being washed by the word and uniting
[1:19:44] with him it's him now wanting to live
[1:19:47] through me
[1:19:49] and it's an individual revelation to one
[1:19:52] person
[1:19:54] that's why when brother branham comes to
[1:19:56] christ as the mystery of god revealed he
[1:19:58] said all hell is against this teaching
[1:20:01] to the individual the revelation one
[1:20:04] person not a group one man one person
[1:20:07] all hell is against this
[1:20:11] because it's actually the only thing
[1:20:13] that will give you rock solid security
[1:20:18] and when we come closer and closer to
[1:20:20] the wrapping up of all things you're
[1:20:21] going to find out that that third pool
[1:20:23] is the only thing that'll work
[1:20:28] you know brother bam told us many times
[1:20:30] that they'll close churches like this
[1:20:31] and they'll try to stop the bride from
[1:20:33] preaching and he says all kinds of
[1:20:35] things like that and you wonder about
[1:20:37] that how will it happen could it be this
[1:20:39] and could it be that i don't know he'll
[1:20:41] he'll he'll interpret his word by
[1:20:42] bringing it to pass
[1:20:44] i believe that
[1:20:46] but look at the wisdom of god
[1:20:51] because once his bride amen catches the
[1:20:54] mystery
[1:20:55] laying under the seventh seal and comes
[1:20:57] into her own union with him
[1:21:00] god
[1:21:01] can pull every support away
[1:21:06] because the revelation is all she needs
[1:21:11] that's the only thing she needs is to
[1:21:13] know who he is and who she is in him
[1:21:16] that's the only revelation that she
[1:21:18] needs
[1:21:20] and i say we don't realize how important
[1:21:22] this third pool is
[1:21:25] and how
[1:21:26] the reason it was displayed in the
[1:21:29] vision the way it was the reason brother
[1:21:30] brennan explained it the way it was the
[1:21:32] reason he preached to seven steel the
[1:21:33] way he did the reason he preached christ
[1:21:34] is the mystery the way he did the reason
[1:21:36] he preached invisible union is all for
[1:21:38] the same thing amen he has to come to
[1:21:41] you
[1:21:44] you've got to come out of the city
[1:21:47] and he's got to come to you
[1:21:49] and through this son of man ministry
[1:21:51] it's got to unite the two together
[1:21:55] and what
[1:21:56] in the marriage
[1:21:59] and then what's not described in
[1:22:00] revelation 19
[1:22:02] doesn't need to be described to you
[1:22:04] because it's experienced
[1:22:06] not described
[1:22:10] it's real
[1:22:11] not just red
[1:22:13] it's amazing
[1:22:15] let's read isaiah 62 together and we'll
[1:22:19] finish with this
[1:22:21] let's read verse 1
[1:22:23] for zion's sake will i not hold my peace
[1:22:26] and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest
[1:22:28] until the righteous thereof go forth is
[1:22:30] brightness and the salvation thereof is
[1:22:32] the lamp that burneth
[1:22:34] the gentiles shall see thy righteousness
[1:22:36] and all the kings thy glory and now
[1:22:38] shall be called by a new name
[1:22:40] which the mouth of the lord shall name
[1:22:43] thou shalt also be a crown of glory in
[1:22:45] the hand of the lord and a royal diadem
[1:22:48] in the hand of thy god
[1:22:50] thou shalt no more be termed forsaken
[1:22:53] neither shall thy land any more be
[1:22:55] termed desolate
[1:22:57] i want you to think of the description
[1:22:58] of the laodicean church
[1:23:02] when you look at this this has an
[1:23:04] application to the jews and has an
[1:23:06] application to the bride
[1:23:09] he says
[1:23:11] thou shalt no more be termed
[1:23:14] miserable
[1:23:15] wretched poor blind and naked
[1:23:18] [Applause]
[1:23:19] thou shalt no more amen be turned
[1:23:22] forsaken neither shall thy land anymore
[1:23:24] be term desolate but thou shalt be
[1:23:26] called
[1:23:27] hepsiba
[1:23:28] hepsima means my delight is in her
[1:23:33] thou shall be called my delight is in
[1:23:35] her
[1:23:36] hebsiba and thy land the beulah which
[1:23:39] means married for thy lord delighteth in
[1:23:42] thee in thy land shall be married amen
[1:23:45] what is your land your land is the word
[1:23:47] amen and the word is christ and your
[1:23:49] land is married and you're now ah you're
[1:23:52] no longer miserable poor wretched blind
[1:23:55] and naked you're now you're now hebsaba
[1:23:58] my delight is in her i'm not part of
[1:24:01] laodicea anymore i'm the apple of his
[1:24:04] eye his delight is in me he is lifting
[1:24:06] me out of laodicea he is united with me
[1:24:09] i'm now in beulah land this land has
[1:24:12] been married to me because this land is
[1:24:14] the word that's been restored
[1:24:18] and now i'm walking through a married
[1:24:19] land
[1:24:21] beulah land
[1:24:23] and now my name is changed from church
[1:24:26] to bride
[1:24:29] because the lord spoken himself said i
[1:24:31] no longer call you church i'll call you
[1:24:33] bride so that you'll understand
[1:24:36] and now my name is hepsiba
[1:24:42] you can call me hebsibo if you like
[1:24:45] because i'm no longer forsaken
[1:24:48] i'm no longer laid to see in
[1:24:50] i'm no longer part of a church or a
[1:24:52] denomination or a system of man but i've
[1:24:54] been freed from all of that and i've
[1:24:56] come out of the city i've heard a
[1:24:58] bridegroom call i've been washed by pure
[1:25:00] water i've been clothed in a beautiful
[1:25:01] garment of righteousness and i've been
[1:25:03] united with the lamb the marriage of the
[1:25:05] lamb has come how do you know because
[1:25:07] i've united with the lamb
[1:25:11] that's how i know
[1:25:13] amen there's a reason it's not described
[1:25:15] in the bible
[1:25:17] because it's a mystery
[1:25:19] in the third pool
[1:25:21] it's a mystery of the seventh seal
[1:25:24] i thank god for his word
[1:25:27] let's all stand
