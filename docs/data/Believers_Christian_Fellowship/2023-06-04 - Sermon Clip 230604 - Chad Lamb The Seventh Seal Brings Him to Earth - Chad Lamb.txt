TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Sarah was turned back Young but remember said she woke up in the morning and they were shocked looked in the mirror she screamed he dramatizes they returned back young amen then there's a little trouble in the land they go down to Gerard and I beat him like the king of garage he wants to take her at 80 years old and make her his his wife because she's a beautiful virgin the scripture is giving us an indication Something's Happened to this woman why does the king of garage who could have any virgin he wants one an 80 year old woman because she had been turned back Young but just because she was brought back to Virgin condition did not mean she would conceive seed because in her original virgin condition she could not conceive seed she had been married for Years brother I said possibly since she was 16 years of age amen and she never conceived she needed something more than just be brought back to Virgin condition she needed to conceive seed and all the time through Genesis Genesis we have God coming to Abraham God speaking Abraham God coming to Abram God coming to Abraham God coming to Abraham but then God says I will visit you according to the time of life I will visit you he says I will visit you according to the time of life and that visitation shows up later in Genesis and in Genesis he says and the Lord visited Sarah this time it wasn't Abraham it was it was Abe it was Mrs Abraham because that's who needed the visitation for this manifestation but he told Abraham I'll visit you because she was part of Abraham she was Abraham she was the part that was going to bring forth the promised son that came out of Abraham so he says I will visit you and that visitation is the seventh seal it's the secret because we don't know the conversation we don't know what the Lord said we don't know anything it just says he visited Sarah and Sarah conceived that's the hour we're living in that's what's happening to you and I in the mystery of the seventh seal in the silence in the little room in the place where nobody can explain what's going on Amen he's visiting you who are you part of Christ part of the word he's visiting the part of the word that now has to manifest the word in this generation and he's visiting you in the privacy of your heart where you can't even copy you can't even copy somebody else's visitation because there's no example given the Bible doesn't say what happened to Sarah just said the Lord visited her and we see the results she conceives and brings forth to child and the 10th Vision when they went into the little room they came out the other end changed still restored whole but they couldn't explain what happened you could just see the results of what happened and so now God he said the third pull it'll be a secret because there's not going to be any imitation of this there won't be an imitation all there will be as a result a manifestation but not an imitation God will visit you in the privacy of your heart where under the seven still under the end time under the Fulfillment of the promise under the completion of the Gentile dispensation
