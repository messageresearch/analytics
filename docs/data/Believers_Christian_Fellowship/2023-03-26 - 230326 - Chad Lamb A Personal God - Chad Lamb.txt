thankful for the hour in which you've allowed us to live Lord where you have taken the veil off of the great mystery of your book and Lord you've taken the veil off of our lives and you've drawn us to yourself Lord in a deeper relationship well we want that to go deeper and deeper day by day pray God that you would just move every obstacle out of the way give us greater Enlightenment greater Revelation and may we draw nearer to you God as you take this vessel in your hand I pray you use this vessel For Your Glory preach your word Lord May that word Lord have a drawing power for your children may it break away spiritual Amnesia and bring us back in contact with who we really are may it move the world away from us Lord and free us to be all that you've called us to be in this hour God I pray you would Lord live in each one of us express yourself today through your word may that word drop into our hearts and take root and bring forth fruit we commit ourselves to you we commit this service to you we ask that you would take preeminence Among Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all certainly good to be here with you this morning if what we're standing if you could turn in your Bibles to the Book of Genesis we'll begin at the beginning amen so we'll look at the Book of Genesis chapter one I just want to make two announcements uh first to let you all know that this coming Sunday April 2nd brother Samuel valwalk will be here ministering for us and that's brother yatzik's son Samuel he was with us about a year ago if you'll remember him so he'll be here this Sunday and then the following Sunday is Easter so Easter Sunday brother Roshan Massey from India will be here and he'll be ministering that Sunday and he's staying for uh several days for about a week so he'll be ministering Sunday and that Wednesday I've asked him to take both services so be in prayer for that as well I mean let's let's look here Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 we'll read just two verses and let you have your seats Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them man God bless you as your seeden keep your place in the scripture there we'll read that again and not that it's an unfamiliar portion of scripture we know it quite well preached from it many times but you know we live in such a day under the message of the hour that the veil has been taken off and all of these things have so much more meaning and the more we look at it the more it grows amen but I'd like to give you uh just a report back from Friday night service I'd spoke to you Wednesday and let you know that we were going over to Holmes County to have a baptismal service and it was really a wonderful time I went over there and brother Jonathan Baumgartner rode with me Brother Kyle Weichert they wrote over there with me and then it was amazing because brother John small called and said hey I'm going to be over there picking up material that day on Friday would it be okay if I stopped by and I should sure be fine so what was interesting is when when Friday uh morning I think it was Levi texted me and says hey have you worked out something or can you work out something for a song leader for tonight and I said yeah I think I think it's already worked out so praise God that worked out really good to Brother John and his wife were there and he led the songs there was a man there by the name of Arley stutzman Arley stutzman had recently left the Amish church and he had gotten contact with Levi Yoder through his sister his sister had given him Levi's number and Levi had started witnessing to him and Sharon the message with him gave him some material he was reading they were they did bible study on I think the water baptism and Arley just saw it he just instantly saw it and he knew it was right and he wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so he he wanted to do it right away so that's when Levi put this together and then hardly invited about uh some of his friends and family and I think he had about eight or nine guests there that he had invited and then there was us from the church brother Levi and his family and some other friends and so we just did a service on water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we had I had the most fun I've had in a long time just going back to what for us is a fundamental basic truth but just to go back through the scriptures and see how solidly we've been placed in the word by this message I mean with unquestionable doubt you go through the scriptures and see what was the faith that was once delivered to the to the Saints this is it amen we've been returned back to the apostles Doctrine and so I had a I had fun studying and I had to find preparing it and it was very very well received everybody had Open Hearts many of arly's family have already left the Amish church and their their fellowshipping in different places in different ways but they had uh we had an excellent time excellent reception wonderful baptism and uh everybody just stood around in Fellowship for a long time afterwards we had a great time and Arlie wants to come and visit the church and his his sister and his brother-in-law uh they they said they wanted to come Levi had been inviting them so I expect to see him sometime he told me he says we want to come we'll see you as the Lord leads we'll see you sometimes so I pray that you all get acquainted with brother Arley and with his family there so I appreciate you all praying it was really wonderful there's something about fresh ears I mean we've heard we've been so blessed we've had so much spiritual food we've been on such a spiritual diet by what God has given to us I'm just so thankful that that somebody else got to hear amen it does something for me and I enjoyed it so I appreciate you praying about that and many of you asked about it and God was good so if they show up you have to meet brother Arley if he shows up sometime in the next few weeks amen so as we look into the Bible this morning we look into this scripture here all the way back in Genesis and we know this really well that that God made Man In His Image he made them male and female and the image of God made he them we know that and one thing that I love about the the revelation of the word in this hour is God God is wanting us to know him he's revealing so much of his word because he is the word and as he takes the veil off the word he's unveiling himself because God wants to be drawn into a deeper relationship amen and so in order to have a deeper relationship a deeper Fellowship he must unveil himself because without the unveiling of God there's a certain distance that that that blindness creates a certain distance that ignorance creates and it's the same thing true in our lives if we want to get to know somebody you have to get to know somebody if you want to draw closer to them and move into a deeper relationship you have to get to know them and there has to be a certain Veil taking away and a certain Revelation that comes forward and if we want to be friends with somebody you have to get to know them to be friends you can't be friends with somebody you don't know anything about you say oh that's a good friend of mine where do they live I don't know what's their name I don't know what do you know I just know he's a good friend but but gone uh did this and and one thing I I I I look at sometimes is so many times we view the word of God through our perspective our lens we're standing on Earth looking up and that's always the perspective we've had but by the grace of God the message has taken us to the other side back to God's mind and from God's mind looking down amen and it gives us a total different perspective on why the Bible's written the way it's written and why God did the things that he did so for us and we're always on this side of the equation looking up wanting to know about God and God's on the other side wanting to reveal himself so he can be known amen the prophet of God said in the message who's this Melchizedek he said God came down and became flesh and died to death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship God loves Fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time for was for Fellowship God dwells alone with cherubims so now we get a little insight into God and what's going on in Genesis God had created all the Heavenly hosts he created the cherubims the seraphims all the Angels they worshiped him he was God Amen because God is an object of worship and so being worshiped in the Heavenly realm he had subjects he had those that would obey his law he had those that would worship him he was the great ruler of the heavens and he he was adored and he was worshiped and he was obeyed but now God is is now furthering his work of creation and he's coming to the Earth and he's fashioning the Earth in a certain way and now he's making something on the earth he comes all the way through creation and he comes to the point where now he's putting something on the earth that reflects him he's putting his reflection on the earth he's making Man In His Image and and now God there's a reason that he's doing this and and and to me God wanted more than just to be an object of worship because if all he wanted was to be an object of worship he already had that before we get to this place so now God is expressing more of himself in the word he he in himself has greater desires than just to be an object of worship just to be a great deity who is obeyed he must have more desire than that because now he's doing more work than that so now we look at what he's doing and he says now in the beginning when God came down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve in the cool of the day and his great voice whispered to them and they had to Fellowship love one to another how the moving of the spirit went through the bushes the lions come up the Tigers all of them they worshiped the Lord man was conscious at all times that his presence was with him man in the Garden of Eden had God walking with him he had he had fellowship and that's what God wanted God wanted Fellowship so we we know this we we've we've been through this we've talked about this amen God wasn't just creating more subjects to adore him and worship him he was creating people that he would come down and walk with amen and he would fellowship with them and talk with them and share his life with them but then we get to Genesis chapter 3. and let's look here in Genesis chapter 3. and I forgot to give you my subject a title for a subject is a personal God a personal God in Genesis chapter 3 verse 8. and they've heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and we know we got to this condition because they listened to the serpent they fell they found themselves naked they made fig leaves now God comes down and they heard the voice of God in the garden and they hid themselves from God they had never done this before they never hid from God they'd always run up to God and had fellowship with God and that was God's pleasure that was God's desire remember when God made Eden Eden means pleasure it was God's pleasure amen it was God's design it was God's desire it was what he wanted and then he put a reflection of himself in the garden and he come down and he Fellowship that was God's desire amen remember it was not man's desire it was God's desire this wasn't man's idea we didn't come up with this concept and this idea God did this is what God wanted and so now now all of a sudden something has changed and now instead of running to God they're hiding from God but look it says God God says and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou remember it's God calling man man has never sought out God God has always sought out man it was God who came looking amen none of the disciples chose Christ chose every one of them he even says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you amen and I have called you and I've ordained you it is God calling man not man looking out for trying to find God Amen God and Jesus said no man can come to me lest the father draw him first it's God who wants man more than man wants God is that right from from our perspective when we've been down on Earth for generations for thousands of years looking up amen man has thought that he wanted God and he wanted to find God and he wanted to get God Amen that's impossible unless God first wanted man and he wanted fellowship with man that's the reason man wants fellowship with God is because God first wanted fellowship with man all of our desire is a reciprocation of his so now we find that for the first time they're hiding from God and running from God and separated from God but God is still Desiring Adam and he's still looking and calling for Adam God doesn't say oh they fell and as if God didn't know I mean God's not down there on a discovery Mission trying to find out what happened God already knows what happened he's down there calling for Adam because he wants to restore the broken Fellowship in Genesis chapter 3 verse 22 let's look at that now and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken now Fellowship is broken the the pleasure that they had in the Garden of Eden now the man is separated and he sent away and he's walking out of that place that he had and the prophet says now the love that he had for the human race and yet had to see them separated from him and the fellowship that he had with his children in the Garden of Eden in that heartbroken condition that he's had to be in all that time because his word said the day you eat thereof that day you die and you look at the heartbroken condition of Adam and his wife as they walk out of the Garden of Eden now clothed in bloody skins because God slayed an animal slayed a lamb Amen to cover for their sins and they're walking and now they're leaving Paradise they're leaving the presence of God they're walking into the world now he's earned earned bread by the sweat of his brow she's to bring forth children in sorrow now you see they're in a heartbroken condition but you could look at that and miss that God is in a heartbroken condition that God created man and God and had fellowship with man as his children in the garden God enjoyed the fellowship God had pleasure in the garden God wanted to walk with them and so man wasn't the only one who lost out in this fall God also but we know it all serves God's purpose and God knows what he's doing because Jesus Christ was the land slain from the foundation before the foundation of the world God knew that he was going to have broken Fellowship but God knew he was going to restore Fellowship because that's what God wanted there wouldn't have been a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world unless God wanted to restore Fellowship praise God so I mean if I could just say no matter how much we want God and we feel that we want God it's impossible unless he first wanted us and he wants us more than we want him so all that desire we have for God Amen that should encourage us amen because if we have a desire for God and a love for God and we want God it must mean he wants us amen praise God so I just want to look at this from the messiest things that wasn't so from the beginning it says can we make it we make it to a Creed and when God has no Creed God is a person I'd like to spend some time on this God is a person God dwells within his church and you are his church if you've been born again and filled with the Holy Ghost you are God's church God dwells in you you have so many thoughts about God but we realize God is a person and and God loves and he wants to be loved God has emotion God will look at these things in the scripture but but God is a person not just an object of worship he is an object of worship but he's a person amen he goes on to say God is a person God can speak God can talk God can write if you look through the Bible and look at how many times God came to people and began to relate to people and talk to people and Converse with people and save people the whole book is about people and God God and people God and his people I mean if we look at Psalms chapter seven let's look real quickly at two verses here Psalms chapter 7 verse 11. Psalms chapter 7. verse 11. I'm just going to touch two places to show what I'm talking about and then we'll move on uh Psalm 7 verse 11 God judges the righteous and God is angry with the wicked every day and so now I just want to show God gets angry God has emotion God can be angered God can be pleased let's go to Genesis chapter 6 now I'm just laying these in as a foundation so we could springboard and build off of this but I want to lay these things down solidly Genesis chapter 6 verse 6. and and we know this is the the fall of Man when we're coming to him calling Noah he sees wickedness in the earth and and verse 6 says and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart we've been through the scripture before but think about that it grieved him at his heart God can be grieved in his heart we're not the only ones with emotion God has emotion amen we're reflecting back God God can be angered God can be pleased God God can be grieved at his heart and I think it's good for us to know because God's Not A Sterile something far away an object of man's idea just an object to be uh of Adoration of worship that's far off unfeeling and cold and informal that's not God God is a person God feels God can be grieved in his heart he can he can feel pleasure amen he can enjoy Fellowship I think it's important for us to remember that uh God depressed is more than just the the object of worship or the great deity God wanted to be known as a father he wanted to be known as a brother he wanted to be known as a friend he wanted to be known as a husband these are all relationships amen this is God's desire let's look at James chapter 2. James chapter 2. I want to read verse 23 and then I'm going to quote from Isaiah James 2 23. and the scripture was fulfilled with saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God so God can be a friend to me I I know that we know this we know the Bible but when you really stop and think about it it's a marvelous thought God can be a friend God can be a father God can be a brother God can be a friend he's so much more Dynamic than what religion has made him religion has made him the far off God who's up there he's decreed we worship we obey but that's not what God wanted God wanted to come down in the cool of the evening in the Garden of Eden and he wanted conversation and fellowship with his creation religion has made him a far-off distant deity but that's never what was in God's mind it was never his desire when God now starts to relate to his children he's a father there is children amen and he comes to them they don't go to him he comes to them because he wants to come to them because he desires to come to them to know them to reveal things to them for them to know him and now that Fellowship is broken and he's been in that heartbroken condition and then when he saw the evil of man it grieved him at his heart amen but he starts a restoration process to bring back that Fellowship that was lost in the Garden of Eden and we find ourselves in that restoration project of God amen but Isaiah 41 and 8. I'll just quote it to you Isaiah 41 and 8 says but thou Israel art my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend I love this terminology because God now is speaking through the prophet Isaiah and he's saying you're the Seed of Abraham my friend Abraham didn't say God's my friend God said Abraham's my friend if God said Abraham's my friend that means God wanted to have a friend amen I hope we're seeing God way more Dynamic than just a religious deity amen so I I mean I don't know about you but I would love it if God would say Chad you're my friend that would change my feeling and thinking towards God not God says I am your God no you are my friend different and we know that Jesus tells his disciples I'll no longer call you servants but I call you friends and now friends but we know God Wants More Than Just a Friend and we live in the day where we realize God wants a wife amen and I I've said before your wife should be your friend but then she becomes more than a friend is that right your wife starts off as your friend and then she becomes your wife Jesus is speaking to disciples you're saying my friends but now in the end time we know that there's a call for a bride amen for the bride of Christ to be United with Christ because he's not sterile he's not far off he's not unfeeling he's not a great deity in the skies God is a person with emotion with feelings and he wants friends he wants a bride he wants to be United he wants to express himself to a being that can understand him and that could understand who he is and love him for who he is when when you as a man want a wife you want somebody that you can express yourself to that will understand you that has an expression back amen you don't want a wife and you don't want a cardboard cut out why if you don't want to be a cardboard cutout husband you're not looking for somebody to carry a title you're looking for a person to share your life with God's not looking for a church that'll be his church his subjects on Earth he's looking for a bride that will share his life he wants to share his very life his very person that's why he is given already of himself and portioned out his attributes so that they can come to expression and be United back to him in Fellowship God wants a wife he's a person he has feeling he has a desire amen in the smyrnan church age out of the church age book he says now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself in quotes Ephesians 1 9 and then then of course Romans 9 11 Romans 9 11 says that the purpose of God according to election might stand who chose he chose he chose because that's what he wanted amen if God chose you it's because he wants you listen it's not just that he felt sorry for you one day and you were reported no before the foundation of the world he chose you because he wants you not to say he'll be a subject that'll be obedient he'll do what I say no he wants Fellowship he wants you to be in fellowship with him says you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world what's the heart purpose of God to have a bride of his own choosing that's where we've come to that Revelation in this end time that should bring us into a closer Fellowship let's turn back to Genesis and look at Genesis chapter 2. I'm going to continue on just a minute with this story Genesis chapter 2. verse 18. and the Lord God said it is not good that man shall be alone I will make him a help meet for him we've been over this before but if you'll just allow me to cover some familiar ground again God says it's not good that man should dwell alone but it's a curious statement because God's the one who made him and put him in The Garden Alone so it's like whose fault is it that the man is in the garden by himself well obviously it's God's fault so when God says it's not good I mean it's not like God didn't know what he was doing and he's made a mistake he's God he's infinite his wisdom is perfect he does everything correctly so the the very language here is for us to ask the question why did he say that amen and the reason he said it is God has something else he wants to express when he's going to make Man In His Image and the image of God he made them male and female he made it he made them amen so now what he has is he has a son Adam all alone in the Garden of Eden and when God looks down he says it's not good that that man dwells alone because God is trying to reveal something of himself to us he's not making creation say oh whoops I made a mistake I left the part out oh goodness me I forgot God didn't forget God wants us to see what his great plan is so now we go into 19 and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fount of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle into the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh amen this is what God is the very beginning of the Bible is he's laying down the pattern amen his desire what he wants to reveal he's laying down his Masterpiece his Masterpiece that the Great Master is working on and when he gets it done he takes his rest and he finds that it's all perfect and he rests but then the fall comes ruination comes to his Masterpiece and the rest of the Bible is God building back his masterpiece God bringing back this original image because this is what he wanted when he would come down in fellowship with his son and his son's wife amen so now God God God is showing us something and that gets ruined now he's building it back but what did he show us he showed us that it's not good that man dwell alone God says I will make man in my image in my reflection male and female so God says I'm making man after my image and I'm going to put him first alone God did it intentionally and when he was alone he's going to say it's not good that he's alone and now he needs to help me so I'm going to do some creative work and create all of these animals to come up but nothing in creation would meet the need of Adam nothing God why because God was alone in heaven and he made his creative work and cherubims and seraphims and Angels but none of the creation in heaven would meet his need the only thing that could meet his need was something that would come from inside of him so now in order to be the help me to meet the need of Adam amen when God said is not good the solution for the not good was not something else he could make the solution for the not good was something that was in Adam so God would pull out of Adam a rib take that feminist Spirit out of Adam create Adam's wife unite the two back together and after he unites the two it says all that he saw he saw all that he made and all that he had done and he said it is very good and he took his rest because now he's done until then he's not done and God in his Creations reflecting himself he was alone in the heavens amen he wanted Fellowship but he made these angels He made these cherubims he made the seraphims and they worshiped him as God making him an object of worship he was God they were subjects to him making him deity but yet he goes and does something more because God wants Fellowship what what was he going to fellowship with the children that would come out of him something that was in him the prophet says it this way in the Masterpiece and as he began to work upon creeping things the little animals upon the Earth and then he began to bring it from that into something else higher then finally he brought into the larger animals such as the lion the tiger the bear then he brought it into the life of maybe monkeys and apes and so forth now not in evolution as we think that one come from from the other that was a complete creation God working in a pattern and finally there came forth upon the earth a Perfection and that was a man and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was God had now been able to achieve the thing he had wanted a man in his own image and then I might say to this that when he made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was the Eternal and the man now in the image of God also existed in the Earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took the peace that struck off it and made him a help me you know why and then he wasn't by himself he had somebody with him and that that's his great work what's God's great work not that the man was alone but that the man and his wife were together that's the great work because that's what God wants and he has any sculptor would take his Masterpiece first he had a masterpiece of himself but now he's seen that the Masterpiece was lonesome like he was what a statement now the Masterpiece Adam was lonesome like he was who was the creator Adam was now reflecting God he was lonesome because God was lonesome because there was nothing there was nothing that could fellowship with God on the level that God wanted Fellowship not as a great deity not as a great God to be worshiped but he wanted somebody who understood him and Adam and all the creation didn't have another creature like him that understood him so God brought that creature out of him and United and now amen Adam had the fellowship he was longing for and it was the cure for his loneliness now God is doing the same thing God Amen has attributes within himself that he's bringing out as children amen and uniting them back to himself amen and God wants to have fellowship with creatures that are like him and understand him amen that's the day that we live in we don't live in the day of ignorance and partial now we live in the day when God is unveiling himself so that we can know him amen he goes on to say and Satan's Eden says so God knew that he would be here then he put us in flesh so that we would be contacted in an order he could contact he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ the son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes and fellowship he said as children of God we are part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning so what did God want God wanted us all to Fellowship as attributes of one great family fellowshipping together that's God's original desire hey guess what the fall of Man had ruined the law but God's been working to bring us back to his original desire what does God want God wants his attributes in fellowship with him in the Earth again amen and that's what he's working through Redemption Redemption means to buy back to bring back to its original this was the original it fell God now is redeeming us back to his original plan to have a family himself in Fellowship upon the Earth and there's a reason I'm going I know this is familiar but there's a reason I'm going into this because so many times amen when we when we think religiously we think God and we put him in another category and we put him far away but God doesn't desire to be there friends God does not want to be far away and in a different category God wants to be with you God wants to be in you God wants to be in fellowship with you he's only there because we put him there not because he desires to be there this is the same God who would seek out a friend in Abraham when Abraham wasn't seeking God God come and found Abraham Abraham couldn't say you know what I want to be God's friend I'm going to go find God and I'm going to worship him he was living down in in in Mesopotamia he was doing whatever the Mesopotamians do but it was God who come and got him because God wanted to fellowship with Abraham because God had a plan and listen how did we find God how did you find God were you you're searching all over for God no God was searching for you because he wants you amen not just to be a church member but he wants you in this age to be his bride he wants something more amen brother says that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself God dwelt Alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again I love this statement listen to this God dwelt Alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again because his thoughts are being made manifest God was alone with his thoughts but he'll never be in that lonely condition again because he portioned himself out of her time and he's been redeeming those thoughts and bringing them back together and someday we will all sit as a family of God upon the face of this earth and the new heavens and the new Earth having the fellowship that God desires he'll never do that again because today is God fellowshipping with his thoughts what are you a thought of God that's expressed in this hour Amen to be the bride in this day and why because he wants to fellowship with his thoughts so we've got to stop making us I'm a little person down here he's a great God over there no amen by the revelation of the hour amen by the quickening of the word that's in you you realize I came from God and I'm going back to God God thought of me before the foundation of the world Amen I was recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I'm his thought expressed on the earth and what did he want in the beginning he wanted to fellowship with his thoughts if that's what he always wanted what does he want from me now to fellowship with his thoughts amen God did not come in the end time and bring a prophetic Ministry to peel back the mystery of his Bible so that we would stay in religious thinking about God he wanted to draw us back into that Fellowship amen after man fell was separated from God God started expressing himself back to man again amen and he expressed himself as a man and he came as Melchizedek amen the the great priest of God and he was a theophany form but he was in the form of man and he come and he served communion bread and wine to Abraham then when he was dealing with Moses and Moses says let me see your glory he tells Moses I can't you can't see me my face or you'll die but I'll put you in the cleft of The Rock and put my hand and after I passed by you can see my back parts and Moses saw the back parts of a man what is God constantly doing he's coming as Melchizedek he and God comes on the plains of memory and he takes amen part of the earth and he forms a man to step into to come and talk to converse with Abraham God is wanting to show what his desire is is he he made us in His image so he keeps coming in form of man through the Old Testament so that he can have fellowship with his people so that we would know him not a far-off thing not a distant feeling but a person he made personal contact with Abraham he made personal contact with Moses he made personal contact amen the prophet says in the message countdown he says and I believe then and there that everything on Earth reflects Heaven I believe that because that you see everything struggling for life is because that there is a life that it's reflecting from and I believe that when God made man he started reflecting the smaller things such as animal life then the next thing he created was something different that just exactly the way the Bible says he didn't he made first the trees in the botany life and he made man and then the last thing that ever come forth on the earth in the form of creation was a man nothing higher ever come because why it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which God is a man God's in the form of man see God is a man so therefore it proves it and then God came down to dwell among us he was a man when God came to dwell Among Us what form did he take he took the form of the man Christ Jesus he come in the form of man that was God's desire so it shows that the Perfection of the evolution was God which is a man why am I who I am why am I in the shape I am because that's where God wants to have Fellowship this is reflecting god let's turn to Second Corinthians chapter four second Corinthians chapter 4. verse 5. for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus saying for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ I think it was amazing that that God told Moses you cannot see my face and live but he's going to reveal himself in the face of Jesus Christ now you can look at Jesus Christ who was what he was the image of the invisible God he was God in flesh he was the very image of the invisible God and God came down in flesh to what to redeem his children but also to fellowship with them so that they would understand God not as a far-off something but now God is in flesh he could be touched he could be seen you could hear him talk he could he could reach down and write in the sand amen now God was making steps closer to man because God wanted to be understood by man why did God send this message he didn't send it for confusion he sent it to peel away confusion and as he peels away confusion he draws us closer to himself it's the unveiling of God where God's unveiling himself to his children so that we know him so that we can relate to him so that he can relate to us he came as a man and now we see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ the image of the invisible God and you can love him and see him as a man and relate to God God didn't want to stay far away I don't think today he wants to stay far away let's look at John chapter 1. the Gospel of John chapter 1. John chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with god let's go over to verse 14 now and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth I'd like to say that the word is a person the word is it's not just print on paper amen but the Word was God the word was with God the Word was God and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the flesh of Jesus Christ so the word is a person the word is God the prophet tells us that Jesus Christ is the word and the word is God the word is a person amen that's why for me it's not it's not just doctrines it's not just teachings it's not just print this word is a person amen this message that come to peel back the Bible didn't come to bring us theological understanding and teachings and doctrines so that we could have teachings and doctrines it's here to reveal the person so that it becomes more personal not less personal more personal by revealing his mystery is great plan is all of his desires he becomes more personal not less personal that's why you know to me there's there's there's there's two schools of thought if I could just share it this way there's a school that says this is what the word says and we must obey the word and and and and there's nothing wrong with that but it can move to a legalistical side to where now we know the commandment and we must keep the commandment and we're keeping the Commandment for the sake of keeping Commandments but then there's this other side that says but God is so loving he's a loving God and he loves me and and God accepts me and loves me right have we seen the two sides and then there's a liberal side but the truth is always down the middle the truth is this commandment is not just a commandment to do and don't this commandment is a person this is God and God does love me he loves me so much he shared his thoughts with me so that I can express my love to him by taking his thoughts and putting them on me and now I'm expressing back to him his very heart's desire it's not about rule keeping it's not about theology it's not about liberalism well God just loves me and accepts everything then you're proving you don't love God Amen because this word is him he is the word amen the word was with him the word was him the word was made flesh the word is also a person so when we reject the word we also reject God claiming that God loves us but I don't love his word how can you love him and not love his word he is the word the word was him the word came out from him the word is expressing him how could we not how could we reject the word and say we love God but how could we also hold to the word so hard and so critical and so rigid and have no emotion and no feeling and no love for God's people for God himself you we could take the hard theological cold formal understanding of word and you've done the same thing you've got textbook religion but you missed the person the very person that this word was supposed to bring us in contact with a person who loves you a person who can be grieved a person who can be pleased to me I don't want either I just want him I want him the word is also a person Jesus was the Fulfillment of all the New Testament all the feasts spoke of him all the sacrifices spoke of him all the prophets were declaring him everything in the Old Testament was declaring Christ so that means Jesus Christ amen the person was the Fulfillment of the word the word is a person are we in agreement on that the word is a person that's why we love the word amen we love the word because it's our Lord let's look in John 15 together foreign 15. verse 15. John 15 15. henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I've called you friends for all things that I've heard of my father I have made known unto you so the question is how did Jesus make them his friends they didn't just say you're my friend he says what makes you my friend is that I've revealed the mystery to you I took what the father told me and I revealed to you the servants don't know these things but friends do I have revealed this to you making you my friends and so if God opens himself up and reveals it it makes the relationship deeper and we live in the day where Christ is being unveiled to take the relationship from friends now to a wife amen now let's look at the next verse ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you amen this wasn't the disciples choice this was God's choice and I'd like to say if you're if you're part of the Bride of Jesus Christ it's not your choice it's his choice and he chose you for a reason and he wants to have fellowship with you and I he wants to express himself to us and express himself through us let's look at Matthew 28 together Matthew 28 and 19. Matthew 28 and 19 go you therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am with You alway even to the end of the world now he's promising that he's going to be with them he promised he would be the comforter to them he would come to them but he says I will be with you I personal pronoun the prophet says over and over I the person of Jesus Christ he will be with you amen this is personal a personal God brother Graham says the Bible said when when he the Holy Ghost has come he will testify me he is a person not a thought the Holy Ghost is a person not a thought a person not a concept a person not an emotion it's a person it's a person making personal contact it's a person coming to fellowship with the person it's a person coming to live with a person this is what God wants this is God's desire says but where is that Jesus Dr Morris Reed had the president of the great Sudan missions the greatest in the world came to me recently in the room he said brother Branham I have enough degrees with honorary degrees to plaster your wall he said but where is Christ and any of it has the teachers been wrong I said I would not wish to say that sir as a person with a grammar school education I could not say that those great fine teachers has been wrong but they've told you the truth but Christ doesn't go by degrees that you get there through theology Christ is by faith he's not a myth he is a person the holy spirit's not a thought it's a person when he the Holy Ghost has come and he is a personal pronoun it's absolute it's a it's a person of Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit living in you not a thought not a concept not an emotion amen it's it's it's not even an experience although there's an experience that goes with it it's a person it's the person of Christ coming to make contact with you as a person it's two persons coming together we've religion has made this so many other things they've made it a certain experience they made it a certain thought accepting a certain Doctrine but when you really get down to the core of it it's the person of Jesus Christ coming to you as a person and two persons coming together that's what God wants that's what he desires that's what he's restoring Jesus said to his disciples in John 14 18 he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you who come to you if the comforters come to you Jesus Christ has come to you not a thought not an emotion not an experience not a I'm not saying there's not emotion and not experience but what what is it what's the point of all of it the point of all of it is that he the person has come to you [Music] salvation is not sterile salvation is not repeating where salvation is not mental agreement amen it's so much more than that it's a recognition that God wants me and that he the person has come to me the person and now we're together it must be so much more than sterile it must be so much more than religion there's got to be a reality where two people connect together it's a relationship amen it's God's love expressed and his love received it's so much more than what what the whole religious World in humanity has made it amen it's the person of Christ coming to you as a person the thoughts of God being expressed coming back together again you remember the story that brother Adam tells when he's going away on a mission trip and as he goes on this trip he says wouldn't it be wonderful what a what a loving family if I would take my wife aside and say listen honey when I'm gone overseas and if you look at any other man you're a divorced woman when you get back in and she says well let me talk to you for a minute if you go and make eyes at any woman or you do anything like that and he said wouldn't that be just such a lovely family he said the reality of it is even if I made a mistake I believe she would forgive me for it right but he said I love her so much I would never do it said and if I would slip up if something happened I make a mistake I would be so heartbroken I couldn't wait and feel so guilty I couldn't wait for the minute that I can go and confess it to her and make it right my brother said that is our relationship with God that's the way that it should be amen just as real as it is listen amen we we as a husband and wife as parents and children and and friends together we have personal contact with each other and that personal contact builds such a relationship and such a love that we don't want to disappoint one another now there's many things that we do in life for one another amen not we don't do them out of convenience because sometimes they're not convenient we don't do it for our own pleasure because sometimes it's not for our own pleasure many times it's the personal relationship that causes us to make sacrifices for one another and it's our love that keeps us Amen in unity it's our love that is the bond amen we become you know how the prophet said that Paul was a prisoner Bound by chains of love to Jesus Christ not by a law not by rules not by a religious code but by his love for the person of Jesus Christ he was bound until all he wanted to do was please him and we bind ourselves in a loving relationship with a husband and wife until we're committed we can have faith in one another even if we're separated over great distances amen I I traveled the world I can be on the opposite side of the planet and I have no question whatsoever about the faithfulness of my wife and she has no question whatsoever about my faithfulness and it's not because of law it's not because of a rule book amen it's because we love one another because we as two persons have come together in a relationship and that relational bond is so strong that no matter what I wouldn't do anything to hurt her and she wouldn't do anything to hurt me now if a human relationship can do that amen why not a relationship with God that's why I do not understand people living in sin I understand making mistakes I completely understand making mistakes amen we make mistakes all the time I disappoint my wife all the time she disappoints me we have to make that right but how can we say we love God and continually live in a situation we know is contrary to his will and to his will how can we say that oh I love God so much but I'm trampling all over his word which he is the word the word is also the person but my love for him should cause me to want to please him because I know God can be pleased sometimes I I feel like religion is still Among Us I feel like religion is still creeping in to where I can trample the Commandment of God and come and sing a song Amen and I'm looking at the church and I'm looking at my brother but I'm not realizing I have just stomped on the heart of God amen but a personal relationship won't allow me to do that if I fail him I can't wait to make it right and tell him I'm sorry because to me he's more than a book to me he's more than a theology to me he's more than the building he's more than the Fellowship of the Saints to me he's a person and that person is a personal God to me amen we've grown past legalism I pray we've grown past Church order keeping the conduct I want to grow past all of that I want to grow back into the place where I love him the person of the word is who I love I love him because he first loved me I love him because he gave himself for me and showed and demonstrated his love for me by redeeming me and then calling me to himself and then unveiling himself to me and that love relationship is what is binding me I want to be bound with the same change that Paul was bound by that's the relationship I believe God is looking for a wife who loves you not a wife who serves him out of fear of hell not not not not a wife who who says oh he'll let me get by with anything I want no he's looking for a wife that'll love him back in the same way he loves for a relationship because God is a person if if that could just get down home to us God is a person God must be known personally God must be experienced on a personal level I don't want to disappoint him I want to love him back because he first loved me in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet said what is the new birth then say well brother Brandon what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you a personal contact with a personal God now you joined a church you shook hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon with that relationship with that Revelation and that relationship listen it doesn't matter where you go you'll serve God it doesn't matter what environment you land in you'll serve God it doesn't matter if it's at work at school with a crowd of unbelievers in the church now all of a sudden my conduct is not changing with the environment that I'm in in church I can be one way when I'm with the Believers I'm always this way when I get with another crowd I change to this amen I say the relationship has to go deeper than that until you're in such a relationship with the person of Jesus Christ until wherever you're at you don't disappoint him and whatever you do you want to please him because he's come alive to you in this relationship and then nobody has to watch us we don't need we don't need somebody to to go on patrol and make sure we're doing all right we don't need deacons to come into our house and inspect because none of our deacons want to come into the house and inspect I guarantee it we don't need to watch each other we don't need to be inspectors we don't need to be critical what we need is to get people in love with a living God Amen we need people who come into a relationship with a living Jesus Christ to the person of the word himself who comes to a person themselves and the two unite together as per two persons together as one once that's happened then you don't have to worry about where they go or what they see or what they hear because there's so there's such a desire within us not to disappoint Christ not to displease him then all of a sudden our attitudes change our conducts change our all the things in our life begin to change let's look at John 17. together John 17 verse 3. I want to spend a little time with this thought here as we wind down to a close but this John 17 is the thought that I want to leave with you John 17 3. and this is life eternal that we might Know Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I'm going to spend a little bit of time on this phrase John 17 3. this is life eternal so what is eternal life to know him this is life eternal that we might Know Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ and thou Ascent what is eternal life to know him to know him we can make it a reward at the end of a journey we can make it this but really this is eternal life is to Know Thee to know God is eternal life in Jehovah Jireh the prophet says in the the Christianity is misrepresented to the people Christianity has been misrepresented to the people as a declaration of creed Christianity is a living being Jesus Christ the resurrected God that's alive and Among Us Now Christianity is a person not a Creed to know him is life not even to know his word that isn't life no him and he is the word sounds like a contradiction that he's saying not even to know the word but to know him which is the word amen and what we're talking about is to know the word in an intellectual way is not the same as knowing the person of the word we can read and study and comb through and and read books of Theology and we could read Greek and Hebrew and we can have a mental understanding of what every word in this Bible actually means amen and still not know him who is the person of the word this word was written about a person and a person came and fleshed this word and we need to know him that's why the prophet would be criticized that you don't know your Bible very well he said well that may be true but I know the author awfully well I tell you what's more important to know the Greek phrases and the and to know the punctuation are to know the person that this book is written about the one who wrote it about himself to unveil himself to himself so that himself and himself can come back together amen to know him is eternal life not to just know about him I'd say the world is full of people who know about Jesus Christ but how many people know him how many people know him that's a good question maybe billions of people know about him no information about him know roughly when he lived roughly some events that happened in his life there's billions of people who know about the Bible and they know some of the stories but how many people know him and how many people know the author real well I want to be one of those amen if there's one percent if there's a half a percent if there's a ten I don't care who it is I want to be one of them that know the author real well I want to know him amen because that's that's life Everlasting that's eternal life is to know the person amen not to know the theology to know the person it's like well well if that's all it thinks why do we read the Bible so much and why did the message come and why is there so much information amen I I don't know about you but I never once got tired of learning about my wife and your brothers if you don't agree don't answer out loud Just Disagree quietly please because Christ in order to draw the relationship deeper and deeper there must be a greater and greater unveiling God wanted to be known he didn't want to stay distant and unknown and behind the veil there was a veil that veiled us Amen to a mystery that he held within himself in the back part of his mind there was a plan a purpose a desire and all of this Bible that he was trying to achieve and it was hid behind the veil but in order to go to the next step in the relationship with his attributes he had to take that Veil away so that we could know that even the back part of his mind because with greater Revelation comes a greater relationship it's true in humans it's true in God it's true all the way around that that we talk about this thing and the word keeps unveiling and unveiling what's it doing it's unveiling to you the person you're in love with it's unveiling to you more about Christ amen it's it's not about passing tests it's about knowing him and to know him is everlasting life I don't think we'll ever get tired of finding nuggets in our Bible I don't know that well I don't know that we'll ever come to the end of it before the body change but I I certainly don't believe that we will ever grow tired of God opening a scripture to us and say ah I never saw that before it wasn't about gaining a new piece of information it was about seeing God all over again fresh and it freshens something inside of us do you think you're the only one who enjoys that or do you think maybe God on the other side we're looking again so many times even in receiving Revelation we're standing on Earth looking up and we're saying oh that was so amazing I just saw that and it makes me love God so much more but who was it that opened your understanding to understand the scriptures it was the one who wanted you he wanted to take your breath away he wanted to surprise you he wanted to reveal more of himself because he wants to draw you into a deeper relationship Revelation is not about heading on its Revelation is about a deeper relationship until the bride and Christ become inseparable by invisible chains of love to where she'll never deny him or disappoint him shall never leave his Commandments leave his word she won't do what the first church did she won't do what every other Church did she won't do what Eve did she won't why because he's brought a revelation so much and brought us into such a love relationship now the persons have become one and we wouldn't do anything to disappoint him it's his grace to us the message has come to take us deeper the message is deep because God is deep his love is deep you say but I don't understand it you don't have to understand it deep you just have to know how deep the love of God is that he will he'll he will open himself to the depths of his being he will open up mysteries in his mind that have never been unveiled before things that have laid in the shadow of the back part of God's mind he'll open up that's how much he loves this bride and that's how much he wants to be connected to this bride God's love is deep God is a person prophet of God says to know him is life the person Christ himself not comparing it's a revelation that God built his church upon and we don't build upon the same that the Bible said Abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation faith is a divine revelation all right this whole thing is built upon the Revelation then and unless this is revealed to you Jesus said I thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the wise of this world and revealed them to babes such as we'll learn now the whole thing is built there you've got to know the person to know him is life the person the message influence he says not to know that his book not to know this or to know that or know the Creed but to know him is life know him as the person Christ in you the word made flesh in you that's knowing him let's go back over that again so what does it mean to know him brother Chad is it when I've got the doctrines when I understand the mystery of the seventh seal what does it mean to know him amen this is what the prophet said it said know him as the person Christ in you the word made flesh in you that's knowing him what does it mean to know him when he is revealed to me and in me that's knowing him and then after if that ever takes place I don't think we could ever have I don't think we could ever Tire of knowing him that's why we'll read through the same Bible again and again and again you read the same books and the same chapters why I just want to know him more I love him I love everything I read about him I love everything I see about that's why we'll pick up the same message books and read the same book again and again how many times have you read your church H's book how many times how how often do you go through it again and say I love this book it's not the book it's the person the book's about amen how many times have you read a scripture say I love that it's not the scripture it's the person that you're loving it's the word oh I just love the word you're not loving print on paper you're loving the person of that word keep loving the person grow in love for a person let it be a personal love for a personal God because God is a person not something far away and distant he wants to be really close that's knowing him the word made flesh in you that's knowing him when he and you and he become one like I said last night in the super sign he's got to come to you God and man must come one I I've said this many many times I'll say it again I don't want religion I don't want religious Notions I don't want religious ideas I want God [Music] and if you're like me we're sitting in the best place Seekers of God have ever set in the history of humanity because now for the first time all of God in the mystery of God has been unveiled if you love God there's so much to discover about him and the day we live and he has unveiled himself so much that he's created such an atmosphere for closeness he's come so close that now he wants to be expressed in full measure in a people on the Earth in this last day he wants you to be his very body the body of Jesus Christ and he wants to dwell in you not a thought not an imagination not a Creed not a Doctrine not an idea but a person wants to dwell in you and I I say God you can have me you can have me brother Ben said in the message a hidden life in Christ he said now we're going to speak tonight on the holiest of holies the dwelling place where God himself dwelt we know in the Old Testament Tabernacle when Moses was given instructions there was three parts this Tabernacle there was an outer Court in inner court and then the holy of holies and God dwelt in the holiest place of all the holy of holies between the wings of the cherubim and now the prophet is going to relate that to us because now we are a Triune being we're a body we're a spirit we're a soul and now he's saying God wants to dwell himself in the holiest of holies said them days he dwelt in his Tabernacle and today he twelves it he dwells in you as his Tabernacle you know that you are the Tabernacle of God the Temple of the Holy Spirit he dwells in you as a tabernacle but we must take this place we must make this place a dwelling not an outer court or the first holy place but we must live with God in the holiest of holies a consecrated hidden life alone quiet with God we become too excited upset about too many things it shows there's something lacking the church ought to be a million miles up the road to what it is now we're still back down in the Adolescent age fussing and fighting and quarreling and stewing and we ought to be consecrated hid away in the holiest of holies with God where does God want to dwell today what what house will you be build me what Tabernacle will you build God he wants to dwell in your Tabernacle where is the dwelling place of God according to the Apostle Paul in the New Testament it's in his body his church it's in Believers you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you are the Tabernacle of God Amen you're the place God wants to dwell but now where does he want to dwell he wants to dwell in the innermost part of you to the core of who you are your essence Amen in your soul he wants to Quicken the true you to life and dwell there amen and and the prophet of God says we get so upset we're fussing and stirring we should be a million miles up the road what he means it means we must not have come to that place yet to where no matter where I go he's with me it's not there's no more foolish Notions of when I'm over here I can do this because I'm not with the church people they're not what what does that have to do anything with you and God now when I'm over here when I'm on vacation listen if you're a tabernacle of God he's with you on vacation he's with you in your bedroom he's with you in the middle of the night he's with you on the back side of the desert he's with you in the high place he's with you in the low place he's with you on your best days with you on your worst day why he is joined unto you the person has come to you and you and him are walking together amen I can I can transgress the law and it not bother my conscience unless people find out then I feel guilty and they feel bad about me then I feel bad because people feel bad about me do you understand what I'm saying if we have a rule a code of conduct and rules I will keep those rules so that I can still look good in your eyes because I don't want you to think bad of me that's Pride and I can reverse the pride and say well I just don't want to stumble you we can keep rules to look good in one another's eyes and not to fail in one another's eyes we can have a church walk where we all walk in a certain level of agreement and we all and we should walk together and encourage one another and provoke one another to love and good works we should do that but we need something more than that friends we need a we need a personal God who's with us all the time and we need to recognize a personal God who I love so much I don't want to do these things to him it's not that I'm worried about what what what you think when you find out or what my wife finds out or what my friends find out I want to serve God in such a way that he always knows anyways I want the relationship to grow so deep that I don't want to disappoint him that I don't want to fail him and that I always want to do what's pleasing to him I know that you're the same way I am that God is a personal God and I want him to be a personal God but I want to be personal back to him I want to talk to him I want to worship him I want to tell him I love him I want to have an intimate relationship with the Living God not a sterile relationship that's sterile and categorized and I pray in the morning of prayer I pray in the evening and I come to no I want that relationship to grow all the time [Music] if you're like me you find yourself talking to him all the time talking to him when you're driving talking to him I I find and when I really started meditating on this God is drawing us so close to him amen I literally fall asleep talking to God and I wake up talking to him in the morning man that's what God is drawing us into with this word we have in this day he wants to be real he wants to be a real person to us and we want to be a real person back to him I don't want to put him in a box of God there's God here's a box of word I want that God that word that Christ to be a person and I want to have my arms wrapped around him and embrace and I want to tell him I love him and I want to serve him and I want to please him every moment of every day of my life where the devil doesn't want you to have a personal relationship with a personal God he wants us to have religion because we can trample on religion and then maybe we're sorry you can't trample on God when you come into a personal relationship with him we love him we surrender to him we yield to him amen let's all stand I pray that God takes my heart and plants it into yours amen not to know him is life not to know about him I should say his life but to know him his life musicians if you could come and Blake if you can make your way up let's bow our heads and pray your heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for your word God the hour that we live in you have opened up a channel like has never been opened before God you're drawing us Lord closer to yourself and a closer walk than ever before I pray God that you'd help us to heed that to benefit from it Lord to recognize Who You Are what hour we live in and what you're accomplishing God I pray you forgive me Lord for my failures forgive me for my the things that I do that grieve You at Your Heart Lord I don't want to do it anymore God my desire is to be pleasing to you I pray you look at my heart and see that my desire Lord is to please you to love you to serve you to give my body over to you that you might finish your work through this vessel God I thank you that you've made yourself so real in this day that we live that you've opened yourself Lord and unveiled yourself and draw on us God if there's any here young person old person anybody Lord that has stayed sterile that have categorized you made a religion I pray that this morning Lord that you would help them break beyond that Veil God I pray that they would go beyond you as a god it would go beyond you as Jesus Christ the historical figure but they would go Lord into the depths of the reality of who you really are a person that loves them that wants them that wants to fellowship with them Lord I pray that you'd open the channels of our heart greater than they've ever ever been opened before may we receive more of you than we've ever received before may you find a Dwelling Place a habitation in our soul Lord may you find welcome there every hour of the day every moment Lord may we make you welcome as we commune with you and you with us Lord You're restoring the Eden condition restore it in US Lord that Fellowship that you had with your son and daughter
